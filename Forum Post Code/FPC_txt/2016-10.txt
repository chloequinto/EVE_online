because then wed all just have 1 ship for each size of shipor lets turn your suggestion on its head why shouldnt a combat dedicated ship have enough cargo space to haul 25000 m3that is what you are asking for we can simply remove the haulers and increase the size of the cargo hold or add specialized cargo holds to combat shipsas for this is eve and pvp is eve you do realized that the name eve if everyone vs everyonerightyes the center position in this game is pvp market trading a type of pvp even mining can have a subtle pvp element if i get into the belt and start gobbling up asteroids faster than you i am getting resources you are not even in a ns alliance if i get into a sanctum or haven first then i have denied you that isk only one moon miner per moon so moons and their wealth are pvp and in this case of direct pvp as in shoot each other in the facesome of the moreshallowposters like to try and differentiate pvp with this errant bravo sierra nonsense regard elite pvp or ebushido these people should stick to playing asteroids on their classic atari systems bushido is bravo sierra and so is the eversion of it if you are doing something to another player and theyd rather you not dothat is pvpand you can try to play eve solo but it is very hard because alot of the people who are going to try and push in your poopthey will bring friends and their friends might bring friends and so om and so onas for mining cruisers yes the scythe and osprey etc were the mining cruisers but they were seen as an intermediate step to mining barges and then exhumers people also used to mine in battleships but in terms of yield and cargo hold they were not quite as good as the bargesexhumers but you could fit a tank on them so go haul in a battleship fit a tank on it and haul nothing stopping youfurther when it comes to large ships like a freighter these ships are essentially capitals and like all capitals they should require an escort now you dont need much of an escort a scout will help reduce risk considerably a scout with webs or an additional ship to act as webber will reduce risk even more turning the freighter into a dread without a jump drive and a massive tanks is just not the right solution
the main reason is that theres no profit to be made in aggressing themhit a pos with 30b of stuff in it you get an average of 15b in dropshit a freighter with 30b of stuff  get an average 15b in dropshit a citadel with 30b of stuff  you get a tiny amount of loot from the salvagei dont agree with the original suggestion  im fine with them being fairly safe but there needs to be an incentive to attack them asset safety unwrap fees should go to the aggressors at the least
the team phenomenon stuff was quite interestingif its done in a way where spawns of npc mining fleets are quite rare but somewhat lucrative this would create some interesting gameplay in the quietest areas of spaceit would be a huge shot in the arm for lowsec the region where belts are the quietest and these npcs could stack up the most  if you go through all the belts in a system and find two of these spawns blow them up and loot their ore that might actually be enough to make lowsec mining with a combat escort fleet viable in comparison to highsec
not sure if it is a good idea to recommend fw in the new npe while having no time to fix fw both mentioned in the minutes
thats because anyone with the ability to defend a citadel gets a fort
it would be really nice if they went with the idea from a year or two ago where corpsalliance can support a militia and then members can join or not i know it would be great for corps like mine that make a point to help all types of new players
as a new player coordinator for pandemic horde nbi i find that the skillets for any alphas that want to try and live in null strongly disfavor any player that chooses to play amarr and to some extent galente the galente characters have strong ratting potential being able to fly the vexor but lack many offensive pvp capabilities amarrian pilots are in an even worse shape nully in general does not show a strong favoritism for armor doctrines for ships of under bs size while ph can and will try to work around these limitations and unfortunately i dont know exactly what could be done to help this situation i just wanted to bring it to attention
as for me and i hope a large portion of ppl in nullsec its about the ability to enforce your rules in a space that you live there is already a serious frustration about those bloody interceptors that zip through any camps and now weve got the citadels that once anchored are nigh on impossible to removethe sense of ownership of the space is diluted in my opinion that sense is among the strongest initiatives that encourages ppl to live in nullsec well i mean those actual alive alliances not the renters
new player herepress f for instant action thats not what eve is or what it should strive to be if i want action i join a corporation that shoots down players or i do a security mission thats as far as it should go im having this dungeon finder of other mmos in mind since raids was mentioned below that part the mmos that have that and offer their players instant action dont last they never dobecause all the fundamentals are missing gathering your ships to start a raid instead of warping to some place is part of the experience and really important regardless of whether the player notices this or not eve doesnt have to appeal to everyone and that is okif you worry about new players look into reaching the people out there define your target groups and actively try to get these peopleor make yourself at least known as a general gamer interested in scifi games i would know about homeworld remastered elite dangerous and star citizen certainly not about eve because it is only rarely in the media and when it is its about a story that happened and which seems so distant to the reader getting articles about an ingameevent which actively involves new players  cheaper first few months would have been great mostly too late at this point thanks to f2p doing something like this once a year preferably shortly before the winter season when people rather stay inside might have been a good idea apart from that numbers are also lower because mmos in general are in a decline communities on the internet have shifted and now there are hubs like reddit facebook etc infiltrating groups associated with scifi and rping on these media and advertising your product there could be worth a try magazines have been in heavy decline for years and where are people going to read about your product its these hubs and media coverage that doesnt immediately show this games hardcore side like the coverage of the stories that i mentioned and obviously dont just stick to englishinternational places different countries with different hubs are worth catering to vk russia nicoUFFFD japan sina weiboyouku china  streaming sites breaking into the large korean market could be worth it they have afreeca for streamingor the brazilian one they actually do play a lot of pc games since consoles are still expensive  200 million people isnt nothing india might be worth something as well in a couple of years what im basically saying potential does exist  the gaming market is constantly getting bigger and bigger but most of that is concentrated in areas where they are getting better and better access wow is losing numbers too but their mistake is making the game easier and easier to appeal to new lazy players which doesnt work as stated above while trying to live on its legacy eve has a huge advantage since we can write our own stories so it should definitely survive wowi agree with thisor rather it is somewhat hard for new players to find into the game this game is overwhelming and you have the forum the rookie help channel and the wiki to get answers that isnt necessarily enough though the forum is a good place for guides and such but usually i have several questions and a new one pops into my mind but i wont ask everythingwell rather anything here because i dont want to spam a threadjust imagine if everyone did that apart from that these days not everyone uses forums the rookie help channel is usually overcrowded even with the apparent lack of new players so its hard to get your answers or only read every fifth line since that one is addressed to you i find myself mostly googling and getting the appropriate answer from both wikis and forums not everyone does that though and it also doesnt help you decide what you want to do in that case you need someone to talk to and corporations would be one such an idea the ones you start in for instance could be used to help the players more individually as it shares the load speaking for myself i actually want to know what outfits best to use for x ship or what ships are good for this and that and etc talking to someone experienced who knows about pvp or pve for other people you cant do that in the rookie channel since the answers arent short the tutorial missions are great to see what you do in each but after that you usually want answers about how much money each category brings what you can do where and how to progress from your current point the problem here is the different languages as people would probably all write in a single chatunless its possible to add several ones for starter corporations and from there you could go out into the wide wide universealso something which could help with player retention overview of public chat channels create an ingameoverview with all the public channels available under different categories with the current numbers of chatters displayed i believe most of the channels are playergenerated so make the creators administrators and let it work like an ircchannel this buffs the social aspect of the game creates bonds and that helps in keeping players in the game well with f2p they could just use that instead of subscribing this also helps with the downtime when you are piloting through several systems basically these channels make it possible to connect to a completely different player which otherwise i would probably never meet unless i would also play in the same corporationalliance or fly through similar space after one month of nonusage of a channel these could be autodeleted to make the name available againwell reaching character limiti havent read past page 6 so some issues might be addressed later in the document
the idea of combat ships attacking noncombat ships is a part of the bigger problem as all indy type ships miners haulers freighters etc are designed so that they perform in a task with no thought of full combat capabilities a way to fix a lot of the problems is to just create these ships with combat in mind consider that all combat ships now can be outfitted for different role types except the indies take any combat ship and it has multiple bonus that allow it to be configured for different rolesjobs take that same concept applied to indies they could have options to run a build set up for either great defense or offense or have them ewar to confuse there attackers and allow escape or they could run a build set up for max proficiencies on their particular job mine haulthere is no reason that any of the races in eve after years of wars and pirates and other such combative events would not have by now updated there ships to reflect the environment they work and live in in all arms races guns get bigger and armor gets better from sticks and stones to guns and bombs to nuclear warheads and unmanned drones how is it that the indies are the only ships in eve that have not evolved with the game you see all kinds of advancements with new technologies and such from the different races on how they build there combat ships but indies are just the same or worse off from 2003 seriouslyif indies were able to have options to get creative with their builds like others are there would be incentives to learn combat playstyles more than just the basics they would provide a more lucrative target because they would carry modules other than freight mining upgrades ganking would not be consider such a unfair and unskilled possible harassing play stylei know this will get some peoples hair standing up i dont mean it is truly unskilled but most serious lownull sec and pvp players dont think taking toss away ships and ganking unarmed indies is a skill worth learning it does take some effort to organize and equate gain vs loss on the gank runs but the combat effort is warp in stop indy from moving then just wait untill it goes popif indy pilots and high sec players were able to fight back then it would not be so much of an issue about unfairness but more about a learn 2 play because they were ganked and we all know gankerz are going to gankthere is no reason why not to do thisthink about it for a moment so many players have posted that eve is pvp and that has to be accepted when you undock eve is not a single player game interactions will happen whether you want it or not not only would this make a better way of content creation but it would add fun to the ganker with more challenge and to the indy who wants to fight back and or protect his assets this would force everyone to learn combat for self defense not just for mission running by incentivizing indys with combat capable ships they would need to getgud proper skills to fight as it is no indy really needs to train out side of their professionwould this make it harder to gank no not really player will adapt and overcome by changing tactics to still get the achieved effect of a gank look at all of the ganking over all i would say that anything out side of high sec cant be considered ganking as it is open season down there and everyone accepts that so that leaves the real issue only in high sec and over 75 ganks involve indy ships then my question is why wouldnt those people have outfitted their professional ships for such an extremely dangerous job with combat upgraded versions or somethingwe used to have i believe frigates cruisers and battle ships with mining options so this is not a new concept and its not totally an alien one either i am not saying to make these ships the best at any particular combat style like solo gank group buff or what ever what i am thinking is that it would have bonuses that would allow it to either fit for its indy profession or have other bonus toward combat that allow it make combat builds to either flee defend itself or stand and fightgive indys a choice that everyone else already has with the new update for barges and exhumers maybe there is some possibilities there but in reality you still cant truly defend yourself from other players or even attack players with any of those even so that is not comparable to full choice when looking at all other ships in the game and then looking back at the indy line and seeing how poorly they have evolved with the gamethere is no reason i can think off that this should not be done if you can please let me knowremember this is eve and combat is in every part of eve it was in its conception its in its creation its always going to be a part of eve anyone who has visited or lived in eve knows this is truecombat and pvp is a huge part of eve no one can say that is not true so if it is such a big part of eve why then do indies not get to be part of it give indies combat capable ships that perform career specific roles and you will see a better overall eve honestly what do you think
i think this has nothing to do with organizing a now completed roundtable and that your post should be in another or a new thread
care to elaborate
using implantshaving to switch home stations back and forth constantlybesides if as you say this is already in the game why not implement it in an intuitive and coherent way its actually better to be killed or suicide than jumping from a prepared clone bay in a controlled manner sorry but that doesnt make sense
implants are optional if alliance fitting doctrines require implants thats an alliance problem not an eve problem
there shouldnt need to be an artificial reason to attack one of these
anyone understood the point with the npc belt miners
nobody mentioned alliances at all
so half of the solution is to not put implants in if youre going to hop across the universe frequently my pvp toon only rolls implants when im going to be inactive for weeks at a time
you do not need a corporation make a small private chat channel for your friends and family to hang out in
i dont necessarily disagree with the overarching idea but the price tag youve suggested is laughable a tcu is what in the range of 100m and it should require 10b assets in space just to declare a high sec war effectively locking out any smaller organization from ever being anything other than a target
my view for the purpose of the scope network would be the system that replaces our current mission system ive already spoken in the fi about it but it would be a system by system feed for combat mining etc provide through the scope network for players to take missions from the npc factionsthe lord loosed upon them his fierce anger all of his fury and rage he dispatched against them a band of avenging angels  the scriptures book ii apocalypse 101 npclivesmatter freetheboobs
to add more life to the game it is mostly visual with some fun game play mechanics behind it gives players more stuff to do instead of just looking at lasersthe lord loosed upon them his fierce anger all of his fury and rage he dispatched against them a band of avenging angels  the scriptures book ii apocalypse 101 npclivesmatter freetheboobs
introducing a new npc spawning system where encounters are generated procedurally ie there are smarts behind the spawning process to produce a variety of spawns with spawn altered based on number of players involved and other factors
this just means the lower value spawns will become more abundantthen again UFFFD be careful what you wish for d
what if you couldnt light a cyno or interact with a cyno while within 1000km of an anchored object
there are gazillion ways to nerf everything cynos capships citadels the challenge is to find a solution that would generate content rather than deny it if traveling gets too easy capital hunters will never bother  content denied but if capship pilots feel its too dangerous they never login their caps  content denied again so its a tricky one the risk vs reward should feel just about right for both partiesdelayed tethering seems way too harsh you get scrambled and youre done no tethering no docking guaranteed death unless you get reinforcements really really fast why do i even want to light cyno on a citadel then lighting it on a spot seems a lot saferi have another idea which may work citadels will give free tethering only to a proper ship size that can dock you can still get tethering for a larger ship if you activate a special module on that ship on top of that this module may or may not provide a boost to your ships mass to help it against bumpers you cannot safelogoff with any module active same for this case basically want a safe travel  build proper citadels otherwise you only have a panic button if tackled push it and get reinforcements you will have a fight on your citadel which gives you advantage lose that fight  lose the capship too sounds fair for me
jump freighter pilots would murder you
because godforbid you show up a little bit early and risk a short wait to gain control of the grid complete the objective etc when you could just time it to show up at the last minute and then rage on the forums that the timers are too short right
jump freighter pilots wouldnt do anything of the sort they simply wouldnt do anything any jumps any hauling wed be fine for the first week or two then  would rapidly start seizing up and ccp would see protests that make monoclegate look like it was nothing but hey at least the problem of completely defenseless ships having some degree of relative safety would be fixed right
you have a rich experience of leading fleets at 4 am do you
heaven forbid that pvp would happen in a pvp gamewhy should jump freighters be able to jump from jita into the safety of a citadel with no risk of suicide ganking in hisec its a pleasure that every freighter pilot enjoys when travelling tofrom jita why should the lowsecnullsec folks miss out you are denying content to other playersthere are adaptation paths available use undock bookmarks use stasis webifiers to accelerate entry into warp on arrival do not jump into systems with neutralshostiles around have combat support available miners have to put up with suicide ganking afk cloakers and UFFFD come november UFFFD having boosters ongrid why should jump freighter pilots miss out on the content generation opportunities fun
having wormholes collapsing behind you should be part of life in wormhole space i wonder if theres opportunity for wormholes which can fit only a handful of ships ie a fixed number of transits rather than massbased limits wormholes which collapse a short time after the first transit and trap door wormholes which can no longer be entered from the other end once they have been used signature x444 since 4 is an unlucky number for the chinese for trap doors id prefer to see the transiting ship dumped in a random location since killboxing a trap door exit node would be far too easythese might catch inexperienced wormhole spelunkers by surprise but surely there needs to be room in the game for expensive mistakesif nullsec why not lowsec too add a station facility or deployable infrastructure which can generate aforementioned oneway wormholes fluxing trapdoor otherwise so that they can not be used as reliable means to bypass dangerous space being the logistics routes that your enemy knows of the intent here being to open up opportunities for explorationroaming activity without making routine transit easier












use 3 implants the only cost 8 million each which are super easy to replacei do not buy implants it cost more than 20 millioni also try to make sure my overall value of my implants is less than 150 millionthats around the range i can afford to replace quickly
if as you say this is already in the game why not implement it in an intuitive and coherent way its actually better to be killed or suicide than jumping from a prepared clone bay in a controlled manner sorry but that doesnt make sense
this is a ticket i have submitted to ccp recently and they responded that they would forward it to dev they also suggested that i submit it to this forum and we will see the reaction  so this is what i am doing right here dear ccp i have been playing eve for 6 month now as a new player and would like to share with you a few comments and my opinion in general about the game i am very disappointed by the pve aspect of the game which in my opinion is a real disasteramong the most annoying pieces1 cosmos missions are broken often end up in deadends they loot nothing valuable and are not worth the time playing them2 normal missions are obsolete repetitive and extremely boring each race has way too many agents but they all provide the same scenarios no surprises no original content no descent loot no embedded pvp3 faction standing progress cuts you out from a big portion of the game because when you progress in one you regress in another making it impossible later to participate in 75 of faction warefare this is a disastrous design 4 ccp dev does not introduce original content pve events as much as they should the only i mean the only besides citadels original content ccp has introduced this year was the amarr purity event which would also provide immediate trading and pvp possibility which is the only positive note you need to introduce many more like those that is one event for the year the others were no gos5 there is no inbetween difficulty playing environment half way between pve and lowsecnull pvp its either too difficult lowsec pvp or too easy pve this design is again a disaster this is because the eve player base is aging making for new players the learning curve way too steep6 security status is a real pain in the neck it makes you juggle between lowsec and highsec in order to get your sec status back either pay a fortune or spend weeks in obsolete missions7 the incentive distribution in eve between highsec lowsec and null is totally totally totally broken as well  highsec is dry like a desert there is absolutely nothing nothing nothing to loot from you battle for an hour just to get a few light missiles as loot  what the heck low sec same it has become a pvp arena and nothing else which is quite sad exploration same null sec is inpenetrable run by boring player run corporations which are all but worth joining8 the game still has a very annoying flawexploit making suicide ganking way too easy that cuts off for many players the hauling and mining activity i know i tried it and its so easy its almost like cheating9 ccp will introduce in november alpha clones a fitting tool some graphical design improvement and gui enhancement that is nice but ccp need to enrich the pve content before anything else at this moment i can tell you the pve content its not looking good its outdated boring is not worth the time because of disastrous loots you urgently need to hire morebetter devs for eve i mean really do it and work on that10 the citadel upgrade is only directly usable for maybe 01 of the players i mean seriously who can afford running those 11 same applies for pos12 please ccp stop spending money and resources on vr virtual reality rd its going nowhere  the only thing you get with vr is a stomach pain sea sick like hell and you look like an idiot while playing it13 forthcoming alpha clones they wont work in the long term and will become ccp next headache because they will require extra manpower resources in order to monitor and fix abuses and ultimately they will degradate the overall game experience  they are only a quick fix for more fundamental issues in the game like i comment above alpha subscriptions will create a 6 month rush in mining and missions and then it will all resume as today like a melted cheese alpha clones will also open doors to bots jita spammers and more suicide ganking which are all three cancers in this game  it will be very difficult in the future to separate the noisy alphas from the real alpha players ccp it is not a good idea to undersell your services players are willing to pay if the content is good  if you give it away for free its a signal that you might not be in control of your businessas a general note ccp it seems to me that you are trying to dance on two different rhythm at the same time  pvp and pve and you sell your product as a pve game where as in reality it is not a pve game rather half way only ultimately the game seems to evolve run by a fragmented community who cannot agree about the fundamentals on what should be donei hope you will take my comments seriously and address them for the coming month and year for the sake of this game which has huge potentialbest regards from a motivated playero7 







1 yeah fair point2 agents are numerous so that people can travel to distant parts of the universe and still have an npc thats friendly with them and theres enough so that all levels of players are encompassed by this 3 actions have consequences thats one of the defining tenets of eve that said i dont understand why youre saying that cuts you out from a big portion of the game is a problem when you complain in point 2 that all of eve is filled with homogeneous agents 4 did the guristas and serpentis events not happen this year5 fw is a pretty good inbetween start with the novicesmall sites newbies today are more useful and more dangerous today than they were when i started playing6 actions have consequences thats one of the defining tenets of eve go train up the correct social skills pop into nullsec for a day and grind up that security its easy if you know how to maximise the use of your time 7 of course highsec is a desert you have the magic space police with their admin gun and admin ammo to protect you while you make easy money i make all of my income in lowsec youre patently wrong about lowsec null and exploration i looked up your corp history mbk mining has a total of zero kills to its name that corp has terrible leadership go join brave newbies or pandemic horde 8 it was easier every year it gets more difficult to gank in highsec why should one single person in a rickety old hauler be able to survive against a group of people in combat ships9 cool 10 01 you say i say 999 im right youre wrong provide numerical evidence to the contrary youve plucked a ridiculous number out of the air 11 see point 10 12 this has nothing to do with eve it belongs in the out of pod experience section of the forum13 explain how all that will happen dont just state that it will happen convince us and ccpwhoa whoa wait whati thought this was a pvp game ive been lied to all this time no seriously eve is not a pve game the most important thing right now if for you to tell us why you thought that if theres people joining up thinking eve is for pve then you can help ccp to fix their advertising problem
have you looked at the csm minutestheyre looking at more procedurally generated pve so the world feels more alive
3 i should have said  cuts you out from a big faction warefare portion of the game and some missions which are not presented to you fw is my favorite part so far and i would like to participate in all 4 factions but i cant because of my negative standing as per today i am stuck on caldari fw the least which could be done is to calculate the effective standing taking into account the trained skills when applying to a fw faction rather than the raw standing which is a pain to bring back to zeroyou need to go back to the roots and do some fw and revise your opinion on this i do it most of my time in eve fw is already brutal because of pirates who roam low sec solo or fleets endlessly back and forth the pipelines in search for easy kills the problem is that a vast majority of them are not looking for fights but only easy kills to show off on their kill board  they often enter the plex with blink super charged faction ships against which you have zero chance and the only thing you can do as newbie is run and learn nothing in the process i was lucky once having a fight with a pirate flying a normal t1 ship who explained to me a few tricks but this is nowadays pretty rarethis is a huge subject of debate too long to elaborate here there are tons of ideas to try out and make the ganking more interesting for both sides in the fight definitively something ccp should try to elaborate and make it more fair for both sides i have already presented some ideas to ccp so that the ganker still has good chances but is exponentially penalized if he repeats the gank over and over again at the same spot i also had some ideas in order to give the targeted victim a better chance to escapei do not have access to relevant data to prove this nor access the ccp databases but this is how you and i would be able to have the real number take a list of all characters who log on avg 10 hours per week for 2015 filter them by age and consider only those ages between 2 month and 2 years look at their wallet balance isk cash not assets and sort the list you will be shocked by the result it would be nowhere close to what is required to run a citadel do the same again but this time take only characters with age being the medium on a standard gauss curve on the total populationeasy  although i am not here to convince anybody i am only here to give my opinionalpha clones will break a fundamental rule in eve as you stated earlier actions have consequences an alpha clone is totally anonymous no credit card attached no valid email no way to link the character with the player they are also not garbage collected after one month use your imagination and do you see my point now  one possible scenario an army of alpha bots cruising around belts and mining or suicide ganking at multiple gates systematically and repetitively around the clock or sending out spams in local in crowded systems it takes a cheap 200 usd pc and 5000 lines of code to program this with a scripting tool there is no easy way to stop this possible scenario to happen unless ccp monitors this around the clock  do you really think that ccp will spend their time in cleaning this mess if it happens  its going to be a full time job which would be much better filled by a software developer rather than a watchdog until now temporary accounts would automatically expire and therefore doing an autocleanup but with alpha clones no moreyes i understand and i agree with you fully but ccp needs to adjust their advertising  marketing communication better and the first place to do so is in the o7 show  and then on their web site the web site is ambiguous the marketing flyers missleading it presents the game with blink open features without telling that being killed in this game by other players is the common denominator and is in fact routine and not exceptioni have already been insulted like a dog in local because i dear attacking a player in highsec or try to steal his loot to force a pvp fight this should be fixed by ccp i think that local chat should be permanently removed from the game
introductiongreetings i am pleased to say once again that i am going to be putting my name in the hat for the upcoming csm elections csm 12 its still a bit early so this thread will more than likely change as new updates and devblogs come out but i wanted to get out there early and open myself up for questions conversation and pretty much anythingthis is my 3rd year running but for those who may not know me let me go ahead and introduce myself i have been playing eve since 2011 minus the one failed account in 2010  close out tutorial  undocks  promptly gets killed by a rat and quits i found out about eve from eve radio and from there other players and staff members helped me get the hang of things and from there i think the rest is history i was hooked it was unlike any other game that i have played and i just love it being a active member of the community is something that i am proud of and because of it i have gotten to meet so many amazing people and it really has become like a second family for me a couple of things about me  community highlightsdj and station managment at eve radio dj yumene ceo of eve radio alliance regular organizer of eve radio mining operations owner of sounds of new eden fansite broadcast4reps volunteer moderatorstaff tweetfleet slack community moderatoringame highlightsthe soul society industrial and logistics director logistics owneroperator for army of new eden  phoenix federation coalition former deepspace alliance leadership  sov manager former deepspace alliance logistics director former logistics operatorowner for the methodical alliance  gotg coalitioni am a big supporter of player events and communities and have always been an active member myself one of which i have been with since 2010 eve radiogaming radio network where i have served and currently as a manager alongside dj accy since 2014 i have also together with accy regularly since 2014 organized and participated in every 24hr eve radio mining operation and are coming close to the 10th operation in addition to these fleets i have also been a regular member to spectre fleets for well over a year a npsi community among othersingame i am overall a industrial focused player living in nulsec sov i am a miner manufacturer logistics pilot and pretty much anything in between i so like to say i have done a little bit of almost everything as i have tried my share of different aspects of the game as well from being a pirate faction warfare exploration mission running and small ganglarge fleet pvpso this brings me here once again asking for your support by placing your vote for me in the upcoming csm 12 elections in 2017 i still have the passion and drive to wanting to give back to the community and help get our voices out there to ccpcsm 11 i was very close to getting a spot on the current csm coming in at 15 i am still honored at the amount of support that i got and i hope that i can count on your support again this year againindustrial focusthe industrial side of the game still seems to be the more underappreciated however i cant say that it isnt getting love specifically with the number of changes and features that are going to be introduced  a strong industrial candidate is needed to get our voice out there  where past csm have lacked the current csm has done a great job this term and have had a major role in industry changes  but with that said i feel that with everything still going on and happening and the future plans that have been announced a stronger industry presence would be very beneficial and neededideas and thoughtssome of my thoughts and ideas here there will be a few that i mention here that i also talked about in my thread from last year however its something that hasnt really been addressed eitherplanetary interaction pi is always going to be one of those things i feel is going to be brought up a bit i feel i dont remember the last time that pi got any major overhaul if ever while it is a mostly passive task it is still a painful one at that  specifically with all the damn clicking you have to do  and forbid you make a mistake and have to redo everything one by one here are some of my ideas 1 factory planstemplates this would be a way to knock down the amount of clicking you have to do to set up your factories where you could essentially save a preset plan to lay them down 2 move button a simple move button that will allow you to simply move a structure around instead of having to decommission and then set it back up all over again 3 3d factory popup possibly shrinkremove this annoying to have your factories side by side and the 3d popup gets in the way of you trying to click the next one 4 resourceslinks create a possible button where after you set up links that will route the selected resource to all target factories that use that resource instead of having to do it one by one example extractors set up to gather base metals and routed to go to a storage facility select on the storage facility and select the base metals that are incoming then on the bottom have a button called route all which when clicked will create routes that go to all factories that has a

accessibilitythis is a topic that is pretty strong with me the topic of accessibility eve is great in terms of accessibility however there can of course be way for this to be improved for more players we have players with all walks of life and players who face different challenges than normal players with disabilities are more of a minority however they should still be represented and have a voicethere are a lot of options that ccp already has to help also tools that were once in the game eve is very accessible for the most part already however there are little things that can still be improved in this area and also it is very beneficial to have someone who can give a voice to those who rely on options for accessibility some little things more ui rescalling options more text size options bring font icons back to the main chat windows and not hidden in the settings more color options ie being able to change the red sphere color in the scanning ui for colorblind players more visual options for hearing impared see below make ui transparency optional not forced when you first load up the gamefor myself i am hard of hearing completely deaf on right ear left ear is soso there isnt really anything that ccp can do about voice communications always being preferred however it would be nice to have more options for those who do rely on more visuals ie better and updated fleet interface with more visual options  possible fleet broadcast tabs or how about a visual for when youre getting shot at like red bordersobviously this is one area and there are bits as i put below where you can also help in other areas of accessibility industrialnonindustrial UFFFDlittle thingsUFFFD w revisits blueprint invention bringing back the invention section on blueprint information without having to go to the copy tab and then click invention would make it very much easier and user friendly courier contracts ability to see if there is a cargo can inside of a contract not able to see whats inside the cans just to show if there is one or not also add commas on the contract sizes cynoseige timers a timer on the top left where all other timers go that shows the time left on a cycle ie generatorsindustrial core this is for convenience and we have timers for pretty much everything else comet mining not really a little thing but i have to make a note to put this in here somewhere please mobile tractor units new option to launch for corp would be nice

parnassius apollo wrote 3 i should have said  cuts you out from a big faction warefare portion of the game and some missions which are not presented to you fw is my favorite part so far and i would like to participate in all 4 factions but i cant because of my negative standing as per today i am stuck on caldari fw the least which could be done is to calculate the effective standing taking into account the trained skills when applying to a fw faction rather than the raw standing which is a pain to bring back to zerodo you realise that fw is against other factions you cant be buddybuddy with someone while youre killing them in the face what youre asking for is effectively parnassiusUFFFD hi gallente i want to work for youthe gallente you shot our guys for weeks and weeks and our friends and families for just as long the gallente now you want to us to give you a job and be paid for itparnassiusUFFFD and ill still be working for your enemy at the same timethe gallente sure thing welcome aboardparnassius apollo wroteyou need to go back to the roots and do some fw and revise your opinion on this i do it most of my time in eve fw is already brutal because of pirates who roam low sec solo or fleets endlessly back and forth the pipelines in search for easy kills the problem is that a vast majority of them are not looking for fights but only easy kills to show off on their kill board  they often enter the plex with blink super charged faction ships against which you have zero chance and the only thing you can do as newbie is run and learn nothing in the process i was lucky once having a fight with a pirate flying a normal t1 ship who explained to me a few tricks but this is nowadays pretty rarestop flying assault frigs if you are set on them please replace the ab with a mwd parnassius apollo wrotethis is a huge subject of debate too long to elaborate here there are tons of ideas to try out and make the ganking more interesting for both sides in the fight definitively something ccp should try to elaborate and make it more fair for both sides i have already presented some ideas to ccp so that the ganker still has good chances but is exponentially penalized if he repeats the gank over and over again at the same spot i also had some ideas in order to give the targeted victim a better chance to escapeyou didnt even attempt to answer my question whyshould a person get special treatment simply because theyre outnumberedin any case the targeted victim has been getting better chances to escape for years if youre solo in a nonfreighter you can fit any ship correctly and youll be in warp in eight seconds or less while fitting your choice of wstabs or cargo expanders it requires some thought and creativity not a handout from the developers if your victim is in a freighter all they need is one friend to accompany them with a webbing ship whack dual webs onto the freighter theyre into warp in three seconds whoosh cant be caught by suicide gankersthe tools exist already its the victims fault for not using them alternatively fly a different route the autopilot button isnt stuck in the on state on citadels citadels are not designed for the individual they are designed for the group this isnt a massively singleplayer online role playing game the lowerbound cost of operating a citadel is zero isk services cost a little bit of fuel but thats not much and you should go outside and see how many citadels have been put up already hell the combined total of your losses is almost a citadel in itself dont cry that everyone is poor when you yourself definitely have the funding to get one on alphas ccp already has automated tools to catch bots so yes i do think ccp will monitor this around the clock you cant run two trial accounts from the same ip address its well within ccps power to do the same with alpha accounts there wont be robotic fleets of alpha camping every gate in a region for the same reason it isnt already happening and i dont care about what names youve been called put in a support ticket for that
you had me at eve radio you lost me at messing with piafterduring world war bee  citadels there was a few months where you could make 10 bil isk a month with 2 accounts doing pi pi i is a good income for click nerds if we make it too easy these spikes of billions a month will no longer exists
a freighter was bumped for 5 or 6 hours earlier this week and there was no gank attempt against the freighter it was only freed from the bumping when the second bumper disconnected from the gameat what point is the ganker community going to collectively admit that bumptackling while defended by concord is absolutely broken
the capital class interdictor would be something you did not field regularly and that you did not field lightly it would have a hefty price tag being a t2 variant of an already existing capital ship it would not carry any sort of weapon system or even be able to self sustain the scripted version of its interdiction bubble without carriers or sc to aid it these ships would share the jump range of a dread and would not be deployable in low seccosting in the range of 37b mineral cost and not being insurable past its t1 counterpart a capital interdictor would be something used when you have the upper hand and absolutely do not want the hostile fleet escaping sporting several times the hp of a dread or carrier and dual defensive bonusesresists and local rep the ship is designed purely to soak fire and keep hostile ships locked down over a larger area than previously possible it would not have the massive hp of a sc or titan but would be enough to soak fire with the aid of reps from your fleetthe normal unscripted bubble of the capital interdictor would extend out to a 40km radius cycle every 30 seconds using a high amount of cap the bubble would cause the ship to become immobile and increase its agilitymass by 16 fold so you could not effectively bump it out of your way after the bubble is disengaged either by the pilot or forcefully by nueting the ship would be unable to warp for 1 minute afterwards or jump for 10 the scripted variant would extend to an 80km radius and would require significantly more cap than the ship could generate for more than a very short burst without the aid of carriers or sc supporting it scripting also reduces the cap recharge by 75 and has all the same effects as the unscripted bubble in short t2 version of dread or carrierlikely dread 710b to be determined by the dev designing it several times the hp of its t1 counterpart only as insurable as any other t2 ship 75 repair bonus per level 5 resist bonus per level 40km radius bubble unscripted immobile while activated unable to jump for 10 minutes after deactivation scripted 80km radius 75 reduced cap recharge no additional high slots purely a support ship not a force multiplier in any way
pi is a good income but its still something that does need a major overhaul even when the changes i had proposed there is still going to be a ton of clicking i also dont feel that a few changes will change the income rates eitherright now you have 45 click to make just to set up a initial resource route not to mention all the clicks to set up links and set up everything buildings schematics ect you are looking at around 2000 and upwards to 10000 clicks per account overall with the current system depending on what you are doing what i proposed wont be able to get rid of all the clicking i dont think anything can pi will i feel always will be the clickfest that it is with that said tho pi is also one of the areas that has been pretty much untouched for years and it really is time for a overhaul  time to upgrade
im glad youre running again but i have a few questions and commentsmy first question is this what do you think the function of the csm is and what do you think it should beif you had to call one thing your platform what would it bewith steve ronuken fuzzysteve on the csm and a number of other csms on csmxi that are very heavy into mining and production in all areas of space are you saying that industry doesnt have a voice i would strongly disagree in all honesty i disagree with candidates when part of their platform is insinuate a portion of the playerbase arent represented even more so in situations where i think they are currently very adequately represented im much more interested in what makes a candidate feel they are the representation people need rather than the back and forth of well im better than that other guywith the introduction of engineering platforms for example i can see why having a number of industrial focused csms would be a bonus but for someone who doesnt know you what makes you special in this field what do you produce where do you do it do you feel you can represent the higher end industrial players capital super titanhopefully i dont come off as over critical as im not trying to be you just happen to be first cat off the rank i will be grilling most candidates to see what their motivations are 
hey judge thank you i do plan to keep at it and keep running until i can finally represent the community and possibly for further terms i dont give up easily thats for sure i want to bring up your last point asking what my motivation is it may sound cheesy but eve as a whole has helped me more than i can say from when i first started with eve radio my corp my alliance and the community as a whole i have grown so much since i gotten to meet people and develop relationships  both online and in real life because of the people i have come across i have been able to open up more than i have ever done before  i have also been to eve vegas 3 times and thats a lot for me since i suffer from severe social anxiety where i have trouble even leaving the house i really do love the eve community 3being able to have the opportunity to do something like this for the community would mean so much to me and it would be a way for me to give back in a way its much deeper for me so i wanted to say that piece first and get that out there as for the question on the csm elected by the community to represent their interests primary function  it is a way for ccp to directly communicate with players for feedback on changesupdatesadditionsect and also feedback and ideas from the community to ccp i think thats a simple enough explanation and im not sure how it can be different than it already is seems to be also doing better this term compared to past terms  especially last year with many rumors going around that there may not be any more csm terms because of broken trust so thats refreshing to see but i would like to see more promotion on what the csm is and that its there i remember last season approaching people both new and older players who didnt even know about the voting season let alone even knowing what the csm is i also understand that steve for one is also a industry player and i love steve hes incredible but hes also focused on highsec rather than my area which is nulsec the others may have done industrymining but if i can recall its not their main area tho even with that said i want to say that the current csm have done great dont get me wrong at all on representing industrialists as wellindustry is about 95 of what i do i have to leave the 5 open for the other stuff i do of course  pvppve rattingect i agree 100 that this next term with all the industry features and changes coming that having strong industrial candidates will be a major bonus and even more neededif i could call to one thing for my platform  i know im crazy and it most likely out of reach  comet mining its a topic thats been out there for a while and i have a habit of bringing it up at pretty much all my campaigns so far and you gave me the perfect opportunity to do so again thank you see
im pretty sure i lost a couple of iq points after reading the posts in this crapwtf you blabbing about dude
re posting these here for the csm in case theyve been missedheres the idea i brought up last night while a specific suggestion the spirit of the idea is the important thing ie determining the difference between someone who plays eve and a functional ghosthere is a thread from raz detailing many of our grievances with the current state of wars that was fairly well received by the other mercenarieshopefully the isd can forgive a little x posting here as these are relevant to a lengthy discussion held last night
read again then and try to understand
reading is hard for some people calm down miner as you pointed out people think they can get away with stuff they would not in rl like for example illegal mining  ima wreckyou
idea is very good i always wanted to join pirate npc corp not cause of the missions but it is would be cool if we had empire vs pirates war it is like fw turn empire to null sec and null sec to empire that will make this universe better for example we could remove cyno restriction in empire space
overheat damages goes around the array the last and first are connected so theres no point in using that configuration if overheating has changed then yes i agree with this proposal otherwise its not relevant
capitals meant to stay on a battlefield with subcapital support not to stay alone and dominate the whole field without the need of subcapitals and tackle carriers and sc can allready tackle with warp disruptor and web fighters wich is allready too bad not to mention aoe death rays and haw gunswhat you offer is a solution to field only caps without the need of any dictors and pretty much without the need of any subcapital support pricetag doesnt mean anything nowdays even if it would come in a price of a titan it would still worth it cause you free up all your pilots from subcapitals and can make them sit in only capitalswe have allready way too powerfull capitals i dont think wed need another unkillable capital what can tackle key enemy ships from 80km without the fear of getting destroyed caue its hp would last long enought to end its cycle and repped up instantly by the fax machines it would erase the mobility of subcapitals and completely clear all their allready low chances while fighting against capitalsplease no no need for more capitals and capital classes
im missing a lot of feedback or questions about the significant difference in fuel costs for a pos vs even a high sec engineering platform theres a 10 difference in fuel blocks required to run an engineering platform with the 3 high sec options compared to a current large pos im wondering if the representation at the csm is taking smaller corps and alliances into account when discussing these changesthe abilities of even a small pos versus the 3 services you can put into a medium engineering array dont match upfrom a large pos to a medium engineering array signifies a very large los of functionality for a small corp  alliance yet has in increased fuel cost associated with itcould ccp  the csm please comment on this point and if it was discussedi obviously wasnt able to raise this before the csm summit as the numbers sizes and setups were not available before hand and i had hoped wouldnt be as staggering a difference for a small corp as ourselvesthis is making me want to petition to maintain the ability to use a pos for smaller corps as at this rate a citadel is unaffordablethanksijlja
the cost arecan be hard on a small corp of a only a few members me personally i am okay with cost one of the worst features i find in new eden is how easy it is for people to make corporations we need fewer one man corps and more small corps 20 to 100 membersthe issue is the corp controls suck dinosaur nuggets  yet so much is tied to the piece of shat structures in space that ccp cant give us the corpalliance control system we should have so we sit and rot in these small corps of less than 20 people most are alts and  because we cant compete with on a individual level with the large and megacorps that have a lot more man power and finance optionso in the long run i am happy for the feedback you provide but we need to adapt to the changes and most wont survive the changes so make some friends merge corps and go from thereright now i have the system worked out for managing the numbers i just need to get more people to join my corpyet i am also not going to kid myself with keeping a small corp if i cant get the numbers i am looking for by the new year or close to i will happily close my corp and join a larger one i am just waiting on ccp to upgrade their corpalliance controls and inventory management systemsi hope this didnt come across harsh i had no intention for it to if it did the lord loosed upon them his fierce anger all of his fury and rage he dispatched against them a band of avenging angels  the scriptures book ii apocalypse 101 npclivesmatter freetheboobs

so i went to use my ingame browser to set my destination like normal only to find it removed from my side bar an gone from the option all together any how following is my petiton an responses lets work to bring the browser back as it should have never left in the first place snip communication between ccp and players are considered private and can not be posted on the forums snip isd max trix
this is an interesting video has there been any discussion or measurement on the relationship between subscriber drop off and the rate of change within in the game the csm minutes seem to show a dev concern with over balancing and the possible frustration of player goal realization has that concern been discussed in terms of the overall rate of change at a csm level as a group under nda it seems the csm people might be able to provide some constructive insight into this
hey morguetheft  i have started a petition here  please sign and share
i did a quick read of the current csm minutes it seems that most of the npe focus is on generating content to make npe more engaging has there been any discussion or significant insight into what converts a trial player into a paid player ccp seems to favor datadriven discussionsideas and to that end would it be possible to make available new player usage stats to the csm as a way to discuss player conversionin a narrative sense most of us can probably identify key moments that got us hooked into eve these moments for me were interactions with other more seasoned vets much of the npe content  discussion does not seem focused on soft power or social ideas of course that is not an easy idea to pull in programmatic terms but i bet the raw stats especially with the upcoming clone changes will tell a story of npe and those stats could be used to help better convert players and to rebuild the eve populationid love to see an active surveying even if just short surveys of incoming players with subsequent surveys along whatever time frame makes sense one thing to capture would be the players perceptions especially as they change over time as they remain in unpaid status i speculate that a player goes from excited and engaged to having short or long term goals and a sense of satisfaction to paid status or arcs from expectant to disappointed this is just a strawman example a lot could be done here and its a lost opportunity if the data isnt generated tooit would be great to develop statistics on over this over the long term and to include csm discussion on this to make for an overall better npe
ever seen the mad max moviestell that to those guysor the new death race moviethem tractor trailers are pretty effective weapons if they are fitted properlyjust saying
yes lets base game balance onmovies
to start i have made billions in the past suicide ganking and have given it up for trading that said i feel it is a necessary part of eve and should not be nerfed if anything it should be easier to successfully suicide gank a shipthe way i see it there are 2 aspects to ganking issue1 ganker disruptionplayer precaution to prevent being ganked2 real consequences for criminal activityganker assets at risk for retaliationall of these issues need to be addressed in ways that do not make ganking a ship harder ex nerfing bumping buffing concord buffing freighter hp etc because that will not prevent ganking balancing this gameplay issue is dependent on giving players the mechanics to retaliate effectively against gankers this way the gankers can still gank all they want but they have to fight for their ability to gank the mechanics need to be in place so players can police the gankers code literally destroys hundreds of billions in player assets weekly and have been doing it for a long time now imagine if all those players they attacked organized an effort against code tomorrow the result would be code stationgate camped code would not lose any assets other than throw away gank ships they would just be possibly undable to continue to operate effectively considering the fact they have destroyed trillions in assets in the past one would think it is only fair that code assets would be at risk for destruction if this coalition was organized under current mechanics that is not the case there in lies the problem1 ganker disruptionplayer precaution to prevent being gankedcurrently there are plenty of precautions one can take to prevent being ganked that said just because one was careless and did not take proper caution to prevent loss of their ship that does not mean the mechanics that would allow one to retaliate should not exist 2 real consequences for criminal activitynone of the proposed changes would change suicide ganking as we know it today however these changes would make it easier for players to retaliate in significant wayschanges need to be made to the undock invulnerabilityaggress red blinking ship on the gate they jump through leaving you with a 30 second timer unable to chase behind kinda ridiculoustags can only be used to increase security status to 5 from there players must rat to increase sec status this way gankers undock in something other than a throw away gank shipganker toons in npc corps really need to be looked at allow unoccupied ships floating in space to be destroyed without criminal flag if a player can take a unoccupied ship floating in space without a flag they should also be able to destroy it without a flag toons with 5 and below sec status should not be able to dock in high sec stations 4 sec status toons can dock in 5 systems and up 3 sec status toons can dock in 6 systems and up and so on all toons regardless of sec status can dock in citadels at the citadel owners discretion this restriction would push more players out of npc stations and into citadels citadel markets specifically for criminals would spring up in low security space this would also allow players who are fed up to target citadels that harbor and supplyharbor specific criminals also gankers would have to undock in something other than a throw away gank ship to go rat if they wanted to access higher security status npc stations giving players the opportunity to destroy gankers in their more expensive ratting ships this would create content and would be good for evewith these changes suicide ganking stays the same but those who gank are at risk of retaliation this is needed its ridiculous that ganker groups can destroy hundreds of billions in assets with impunity i dont expect to see this happen even though i think it would be great for the game in many ways but these are my thoughts this is how you give power to the player to retaliate balancing ganking without nerfing italso allowing alphas to attack players in high sec is a mistake players are going to abuse the ability to simply make another alpha gank alt again and agian and again
hell why not its a game right besides if it works with random pickup trucks and station wagons in the middle east with 50cals and antiair cannons welded to them it wouldnt be much different if the flat bed trailers can haul a tank they can have a tank chassis built on to it with a working turret and other guns the first armored vehicles to be used in war were basically civilian vehicles with armor and guns welded onto them hell there are current black ops vehicles that are civilian suvs with armor and guns attached why not a big rig russia and most of europe did it with rail cars and trains during world war i and ii pirates would take merchant vessels and put cannons flame throwers on them to attack other merchant vessels ahhtheres something to think aboutall those pirate faction ships would be total crap if we were to use real world pirate examples lol using movies as basis for game balance is far better than real life
those jerry rigged setups only work for as long as nothing shoots backyou can literally take one out with single grenadearmored or not they cant take or deal anything close to the punishment that a dedicated war vessel canthat wont work either recoil is a pita and you cant accurately fire without a stable platform which would necessitate you to actually stop and deploy arms like artillery to maintain stabilityand you can still take out the front cab with a single grenade like you can with a pickup truck it isnt built for war put armor plates on it and you will need to upgrade the chassis to hold the extra weight then you need to install a more powerful engineat which point it becomes unreasonably expensive better to save costs by creating a dedicated platform with everything integrated those are not made for war in a traditional sense they are made to get in get out and only take damage from light weapons they will suffer against anything heavier see grenadeand they were laughably ineffective for multiple reasons see limited to tracks train couldnt move when firing reload was a pita easy to interdictand they all ran from dedicated war ships because they knew they could not actually fightmovies are made to look cool they are not good material for ship balancing
small arms fire like from light small turrets on a destroyerhrmminterestingif pirates would run why is it that pirates namely npcs dont do that most of the time they chill out and let you blow them up the ai is pretty random on having them run away to fight another day same goes for players again if we wanted to balance ships based on real life than there would be very big changes that people would like or think looked cool again its a game why not
small arms in rl would be thinks like pistols m16s and ak47sso yeah small class weapons would countas for the pirate npcseve is a distopian setting pirates are running military hardware equivalent to the npc naviesimagine if somolian militias has us tech and hardwarebut according to the lore most pirate npcs are traditionally manned ships with most of the crew being conscripts or the dregs of society not capsuleers so that is supposed to explains why we are faster tankier and hit harder than they can we are optimized and trained they are notgameplaywise because your typical filthy casual and nubbin dont want to enconter an npc that can kill them so they are made as easy as possibleand i think you are still missing the pointwe had balancing done on because it would be cool some odd years ago some of the worst overpowered  fit of the month ships came about from this it was not fun it was frustratingedit also rl pirates during the privateer age did not run from military vessels because they were piratesthey ran because it is very very dumb to directly engage a dedicated war vessel with a retrofitted kludge of a combat vesselthere is a reason why qships see combat retrofitted merchant ships were discontinued and written off as an ineffective tactic because they only had surprise on their side and relied heavily on a hostile ship wanting to capture rather than kill thema pt boat could have killed one
jintaan in a probably futile effort to get this thread back on a semblance of topic seriously people make a new thread for your latest nerf ganking idea i would like to ask you if you could provide any information or feedback that came out of this roundtable and the first one as well reading the csm minutes it seems that highsec criminal mechanics were not discussed at all outside of the impact of alpha clones on the practice the only discussion of the actual mechanics of highsec crime that made it into the minutes at least seems to be a completely inaccurate graph showing the number of attackers vs isk lost almost certainly that shows all highsec freighter losses not just those due to suicide ganks given you cant gank a rhea with 4 attackers and since wardec losses make up a large fraction of highsec freighter kills especially jump freighter kills the graph is really not useful regardless i would appreciate it if you could find the time to report what feedback you collected on this issue from your two roundtables whether or not you had the opportunity to present it to ccp
okay so you want your station wagon with a 50 cal to be as combat effective as a vehicle designed specifically for combatnoand this is a video game not the real worldand an armed merchant vessel is fine for attacking other merchant vesselsnot so much for an actualyou knownaval vesseland yeah it is a game but it should still be balanced you are advocating for imbalance
i can see you never played dust when an orbital strike was called in it was from a destroyer they were not small arms have you looked at a size chart for the ships in eve the smallest autocannon in the game is a 125mm gun that would put it on par with some of the largest tank cannons we have todayand that is the small stuff the biggest autocannon that can go on a frigate is a 200mm gun the largest artillery is 280mm and this is not even considering the ammo for example the fusion warhead is basically an artillery shell with a fusion warhead in it compared to this kind of weaponry you might as well be pissing in the wind with that 50 calas for pirates in this game you do understand that they are essentially sov holding entities like the empires they do not just put out cobbled together glue fits but field actual battleships dreads and so forth you are comparing them to rl pirates who had nothing equivalentand balancing on real life is just not going to happen hell the physics for this game really has us all flying underwaterin case you didnt notice and even in real life a support vessel in the navy would not have the armament to deal with a dedicated combat ship
the thing that would most help ccp get and retain people is to get someone in from statistics iceland to teach them how to do a survey and how to objectively examine the resultsthe survey of 8000 people how did they determine these 8000 was it a random sample chosen via some other means etcthe output data less than 1 answered ganking how many didnt answer how many said things that might incorporate this such as game mechanics or your game sux what was the primary answer these 8000 gave for leavingthe better nonnpe questions ccp would already have the data or should have the data for arehow many people leave within a few days of a gank do people know how to tank a ship how many are solo how many in small corps how many in largewhat is the profile of the customer likely to spend the most what do these people want do they pvppve are they casual players or hardcore never assume anythinghowever given the levels of bias in some areas of ccp they are probably better handing the data and a wad of cash to statistics iceland and asking for an analysisthe other things they need to do is become part of the 21st century where overt forum moderation like deletion of social media comments is considered a black mark against a company and the other is the same problem they always had and that was world class horrible customer serviceand remember statisticians do it by the numbers
seriously you probably misrepresented that study in every way possible i dont even address your points since i start to believe that you are just a troll who deliberately lies to get a reactionif you are not a troll then you should probably watch the video once again and correct your post
actually i did play dust514 and i believe it is still installed on my ps3 you are talking about two different games also two different forms of combat i was using a 50cal as an example to illustrate that it is possible to tack weapons on to a vehicle that would normally not have the hard points for those weaponssmall arms when it comes to a ship like naval ships would be a 5in deck gun like you see on the front of a destroyer which is about the same size as as your 125mm rail guns or the same size as a modern day m1s 125mm smooth bore the larger guns like the 8 and 10in main guns on cruisers or the big bad 16s on the mighty mo are your larger weapons due to the armor thickness on cruisers battle cruisers and battleships the guns on frigates and destroyers wouldnt do much except kill the people that were exposed on the decks of the large vessels most of the time the frigates and destroyers were used as small escort vessels for convoys or as over the horizon scouts for the big boys this would give the large guns a visual spotting aid again this is wwii era naval vessels if you want to talk colonial we can or modern every naval vessel has its pros and cons that could be analyzed and help balance this game with its futuristic weaponsin regards to qships they were extremely effective against the nazi u boats a torpedo cost a lot of money and they only had a few on board when attacking a merchant vessel they would first surface and use the deck gun on the uboat this is why a lot of wwii subs had a deck gun the qship would mount frigatedestroyer size weapons like a 5 inch gun usually 1 to 3 turrets worth that the would cover with mock truck cut outs so that they would appear to be a cargo vessel when the uboat would surface they would move the covers out of the way and blow the pour bastards out of the water this is why modern subs no longer have surface weaponry when the subs stop coming up the use for a qship went away if you are ever in the chicago land area hit up the museum of science and industry they have a captured uboat u505 which you can walk through and tour as well as lots more information about naval combat if you are on the east cost there is the uss intrepid which has more naval air history than naval combat engagement history i believe there is something similar on the west coast as wellweather we use real world to balance or movies we can all agree that the balancing does need fixing when it comes to ships overall combat in the game etc the industrial vessels need some serious work as do many other types and classes of vessels in this game
no the plan was for the two games to become integrated over time that people playing dust would even take part iirc in taking and holding sovand my point is that such a ship would be no match for a combat dedicated ship you have not implicitly agreed to that oh and there are haulers in the game where you can put guns on them of course they wont stand up very well to a dedicated combat ship but you can do itso get out there and go roaming looking for trouble in a battle badger
look a person who does not understand statistics complaining about others doing statistics
but politicians complain that people didnt answer the questions the way they were supposed to and argue the opposite instead
no politicians and media organisations cherry pick the statistics that they want and ignore the reasons they occured or ignore the more important statistics that dont tell the story that they want to they used to complain that people didnt answer like they were supposed to now they just assume most people are idiots and they are rightnational accounts are a great example of this where politicians and the media tell people how well things are going by pointing to growth in gdp figures even though that growth has only occured because the economy is in such a crappy state that no one can afford to buy imported goods so the gdp goes up because even though exports have fallen imports have fallen even more and that imbalance causes a rise in gdp even though the internal economy is flat or going backwards
yeah we were aware these stats were oddnon reflective thanks to having asked a lot of questions from gankers in the run up to this effectively it just came to us not asking the question of the data in quite the right way a lot of the people who knew how best to torture eves big data in the csm have left so we made a few pretty simple errors im hoping that well be able to work on this in the next summit and get some better input especially given the influx of data points from alphas
glad to see some one on the eve radio team running


the fact you wrote that shows you should never use statistics as you do not understand themsample size selection and relevance are normal parts of statistical analysis as areresponse rates and bias both internal and external while there are many others i will keep this simplethe fact that we do not know how these 8000 were chosen is by itself troubling we know they were looking at npe but did these accounts die after the trial period how many were reactivated continued ecthow many of these accounts were done by recruiting a friend how many were blind while they may be statistically valid we dont really know subsequently they cannot be taken to be real because we dont knowin the less than 1 stated ganking statistic what is the percentage of no response how many stated similar things you see without knowing what is searched for you cannot determine bias and without knowing the response rate you cannot determine the validity of the samples or the margin of error if say 10 answered and 1 said ganking then that is a big thing while if 90 answer and 1 say ganking then it is no big dealthat is why i said they should consult statistics iceland their current outputs are limited to say the leastwith the new free to play starting in a few weeks people should have to provide basic information to create an account just like microsoft require call it to make a better service things such as name sex income country and then this should be linked to accounts and then when an account becomes dormant for a few weeks a survey should be sent to determine whyfrom that they can actually build better statistics and a better game as for the players we really cannot validate their statistics especially given the bias that exists within ccp on all sides of the spectrumafter all i am sure their management would wish to know the income and play styles of the 8 or so that will spend money on the game to support those that dont pay for itstatistics will also add weight to the csm while the csm influence ccp there are times were they shouldnt and statistics will show this and there are times were ccp should shut up and listen to the csm the two that come to mind are incarna and the pos debacleas to the forums themselves ccp should listen to the feedback on their dev blogs as that always seems to hit the nail on the head but the majority of it is just wasted space take the current ganking argument there are those on the forums who hate it those who love it and dont want it changed at all those who want it made easier and those that want it made harder pure statistics is the answer especially when you consider the fact that only about 10 of a game population read the forums and around 35 actually commentso really forum discussions are more about self interest than what ccp should ever listen too they have an economist well they need a statistician and one with some power to do thingsthe fact that this game is about to go free to play is a huge wasted opportunity if they do not include a survey in the account creation section
yeah well i dont think so you see in your hubris you fail to realize that what you are talking about is not science but scientism and in case you dont know it it is a bad thingit is hard to know what effect ganking has on players the player base and new players because we do not have the counter factual that is we cannot do the followinghave player joe log in and get suicide ganked on his 11th day in gamerewind the clock and have joe not get suicide ganked in his first 15 daysthe 15 days was what was used in that presentation by ccp at fanfestin essence we cannot to a controlled experiment at best we can go for a natural experiment which is kind of what ccp tried to dothey took 80000 individualsie not accounts but subscribers so as to avoid problems with alt accounts then they looked to see how many suffered a ship lost in their first 15 days of the 8000068400 were not killed in their first 15 days10800 were killed legallyie their killer was not in turn scorched by concord800 were gankedof those three groups the ones who stayed with the game the longest were in order1 those ganked2 those killed legally3 those we did not die in their first 15 daysin addition the fun fact of less than 1 of those leaving the game cited ship loss as the reason in listening to the presentation it was not less than 1 of the 80000 but less than 1 of everyone leaving the game so your 8000 players is reallywell nothingnow is it possible that there was some confounding factor at play here sure maybe those 800 players who were ganked were all in really good player corpswhich probably helps retention and maybe the same is true for those killed legally too but given the numbers that strikes me as unlikely especially if they picked a random sample of 80000 subscribersand the reason you pick such a large sample is so that when you do start breaking that sample down into subgroups you will typically have enough so that you wont have a problem with a small sample for example if ccp had sampled just 1000 subscribers they might end up with 10 or 11 guys who were ganked with such a small number then the good corp problem for example could ruin your results but when looking at 80000 with almost 12000 of them having been killed in their first 15 days you probably dont have to worry about that kind of a problem of course ccp could have used a stratified sampling approach where they go in and look for subscribers in each category and randomly pick say 5000 eachand yeah there are additional factors that can come into play as well that could influence these results age marital status job etc could all be factors but again with such a large number of players who were killed and ganked those effects are likely to be washed out also ccp does not have much of this data they might be able to get age but job and marital status nope probably notat least not from what they get when a person signs up from the gameas for the rest of you questions like know how to tank a ship that would require an extensive bit of surveying done when people quitewhich would likely be quite costly and you always have the issue of those who simply refuse is there something about those players that are biasing your results
i am not talking about scientism i am talking about statistical theory scientism does not allow for a margin of error yes it was in relation to this 1 i was stating that not knowing the number of nonrespondants and not knowing what was searched for eg was it just the word gank or was it piracy and ganking etc without that that 1 is meaningless you said the magic word if the problem is we do not know how they came up with those 80000 subscribers random or otherwiseas to age marital status etc that is something ccp should be collecting ccp is a business and they should be making decisions based on sound statistical information microsoft and a lot of other companies ask for income ect in signup these days and ccp should catch up with the times maybe even giving some ingame bonus for people to complete ityes nonresponse is always a factor as to whether something becomes statistically valid or not as to cost most of what i have outlined can be done fairly cheaply via a simple database and then just queries to resolve itafter all it would lead to a better game and a more survivable ccp
again that 1 was for all subscribers who have left the game not the 80000 players ccp used for that presentationso you going on about 8000 highlights that indeed you do need to watch it again and refresh your memoryas for the 80000well im pretty sure ccp knows that picking subscribers randomly would be the best way that is really basic stuff considering they probably have had well over 1000000 cumulative subscribersand collecting demographic data is not costless would it be awesome to have it sure but it comes with costs first of all you have to risk losing subs if you make such information mandatory if you dont then that whole issue you were worried about with regards to how the 8000 were selected pops back upthat is responders vs nonresponders vs outright liars and if you hire a firm to do it that is an obvious and direct cost tooi work for a company that has lots of customers and we dont go out collecting that kind of data and we are a utilitysome people might think wed have that data how many people in the house what kind of appliances etc but we typically dont have that data if we want it we have to go to a vendor who has collected some of that data
no i was referring to the 1 of all subscribers how many leave the game and say nothing how many said something that might incorporate gankingas to random for the 80000 you assume it was random that makes the statistic worthless yes random is the best but there is no proof either way that is what was usedas to costless i did not say that but it would in the long run cost them less than their wild stabs in the dark have cost them over the years as to mandatory would you lose that many on sign up to a free game for that information probably not you would have to calculate the trend line and error margin to exclude erroneous data from liarsas to a firm they should not need to do that statistics iceland would probably bend over backwards to help them as would many phd studentsas to your own work place i guarantee they can tell you the average power usage on any minute on any day of the week on any street and given the country you are from may have required a credit check before connecting the power which has all sorts of useful items on it depending on countrysimple web forms by companies are occuring more and more same as shopper rewards cards ect data is valuable and you are better to have it and not need it than you are to need it and not have it
maybe you should consider thinking like a bayesian
no something i have much use for it is primarily used to determine probabilities with unknown paramatersi am no astrophysicist or weather forecaster subsequently i have never really studied bayesian statisticsi will admit it is an interesting concept for modelling especially things such as percentage of smokers rising or falling given a tax rate using other economic indicators such as unemployment rates cpi and the immigration rate especially given that the levels of immigration to a country from other countries with variable smoking rates varies from country to country


thank you glad to have the support
i think there is a skill for this

hello i am a new player too eve i am not a new player to games have played since the first game systems hit the marketi have been playing now for about 3 months and have spent money on the game and allot of time that means i enjoy itas a new player i realized that i need to focus on a few ships due to the lack of skill points i have vs someone that has been here for years so as a pvp ship i focused on trying to get all the skills to fly i svipul and fly it well enough to do something i didnt know that they where considered op or whatever so now i hear the ship is to be nerfed and nerf so bad as to not be useful so i ask what did i do deserve to be punished and have the time i just spent trying to get into this game taken awayinstead of nerfing you made the mistake not me buff others doesnt it seem better to reward a bunch rather then punishing a few this is not to complaint i have played many games that nerf peoples classes have u ever noticed after nerfs to peoples classes in all games those people seem to fade away and quit the gameever seen a bunch of people quit a game after getting buffed
the svipul wasis overpowered youre not being punished youre having your unfair advantage taken awaythat said its not going to be useless afterwards it just wont be as strong
buffing everything to bring one ship into line is a hideous ideabecause it leads to power creep and you cant just compare a single ship class ignoring the others so youd have to buff pretty much everything in game
if you didnt know they were op then what drew you to the svipul it will still look the same it will still fill the role it was made for it just isnt the kill everyone else ship it was but you have lost nothing of that since you didnt know and thus want that anyways rightkey thing is we dont want one ship to rule them all we want them to be balanced and choices to be made about which to fly and what will counter what steve above is right balancing is not always about adding more but sometimes trimming back that is what happened in this case and i seriously doubt that the ship has become unflyable just it is not the overpowered beast it once wasm
good question what is the role of the svipul the nerf sounds not that bad though i have not tested the new stats yet but im a bit salty that hecate and jackdaw with rig are allowed to keep their instawarp while svipul and confessor got the mode switch trick removed without compensation this together with the new scram vulnerability removes the potential as general purpose solo roaming ship in the era of infiniscrams
i would like to get involved with one of the isd corps i would also like to run for csm in the future i read that csm candidates can not be isd members can you please give a little infois the csm ban life long for isd memberis it a year banis it some other time frame for not runnngis there any other info i should know if i want to be an isd member soon and a csm in the future
youre literally arguing that the game should be left unblanced or else those people were perfectly well aware youre referring to yourself here will quit in a huff
ship balancing is not a reward or a punishment i cannot imagine the level of self entitlement that is required to think you are being punished by ccp while they are trying to balance the game and make it more playable and enjoyable for everyoneat any rate if history is any indicator there will be a new fotm you can train for thateve is like an addiction you cant quit it until it quits you also iderno
