This is CCP Fozzie bringing you the long-awaited details of the second Tactical Destroyer coming your way this February in the Tiamat release.

For anyone who isn’t familiar with the Tactical Destroyers, they are new advanced ships created by the four great Empires of New Eden with the help of capsuleers like you! Last October we ran an event that encouraged players to participate in new research on the mysterious Sleepers of Anoikis. Players could choose whether they wanted to support one or more of the empires (or if they’d prefer to work towards their own ends) and the relative amount of support each empire received determined how quickly they would be able to release their new ships.

The supporters of the Amarr Empire were the most dedicated and thanks to their hard work the Empire’s shipyards were able to release the Confessor-class Tactical Destroyer to capsuleers in December with the Rhea release.

We have been very happy with how the Confessor and the new Tactical Destroyer mechanics have been received by players. Industrialists and wormhole resource harvesters have been able to make huge profits off the new technology and there are numerous great examples of skilled pilots demonstrating their mastery with this flexible ship. PVP live streamers like Fintarue and video makers like Chessur have demonstrated particularly impressive performances.

The Minmatar Republic came second in the Research Race, and their engineers are getting close to having a production-ready Tactical Destroyer of their own. The Minmatar Tactical Destroyer is known as the Svipul (properly pronounciated by CCP Scarpia), and it represents many of the best aspects of Minmatar engineering.

Wielding six turret slots bonused for projectile weaponry, the Svipul is deadly with artillery and autocannons alike. It also makes excellent use of the trademark Minmatar versatility, gaining bonuses to both armor and shield resistances while Defensive Mode is active. Although its lower mass makes it a bit less suited to oversized afterburners compared to its Amarr contemporary, the Svipul is the fastest of all the Tactical Destroyers and can use that speed to pick apart unwary enemy fleets.

However I think we all know the real question on every reader’s lips is “How vertical is it?” and that is a question best answered with a picture (the following is a work in progress image of an untextured model):

Like the Confessor before it, the Svipul has three modes with distinct physical configurations and bonuses. Unlike the Confessor, the Svipul actually pivots on an internal axis to present a horizontal profile in Propulsion Mode and a vertical profile in the default Defense Mode as well as Sharpshooter Mode.

Although the mode archetypes (Defense, Sharpshooter, Propulsion) are the same on all the Tactical Destroyers, the specific bonuses given by those modes are adapted by each Empire to fit their own needs. The stats and bonuses of the Svipul are:

SVIPUL

Minmatar Tactical Destroyer Bonuses Per Level:
10% bonus to Small Projectile Turret damage
10% bonus to Small Projectile Turret optimal range
5% reduction in heat damage generated by modules

Role Bonus:
95% reduction in Scan Probe Launcher CPU requirements

Additional bonuses are available when one of three Tactical Destroyer Modes are active. Modes may be changed no more than once every 10 seconds.
Defense Mode:
33.3% bonus to all shield and armor resistances while Defense Mode is active
66.6% reduction in Microwarpdrive signature radius penalty while Defense Mode is active
Propulsion Mode:
66.6% bonus to maximum velocity while Propulsion Mode is active
33.3% bonus to ship inertia modifier while Propulsion Mode is active
Sharpshooter Mode:
33.3% bonus to Small Projectile Turret tracking while Sharpshooter Mode is active
100% bonus to sensor strength, scan resolution and targeting range while Sharpshooter Mode is active

Slot layout: 7 H, 4 M, 4 L, 6 turrets , 1 launcher
3 Rig Slots, 400 Calibration
Fittings: 78 PWG, 215 CPU
Defense (shields / armor / hull) : 800 / 700 / 550
Base shield resistances (EM/Therm/Kin/Exp): 50 / 40 / 40 / 50
Base armor resistances (EM/Therm/Kin/Exp): 80 / 51.25 / 25 / 10
Capacitor (amount / recharge rate / average cap per second): 600 / 225s / 2.667
Mobility (max velocity / agility / mass / warp speed / align time): 290 / 2.65 / 1,900,000 / 4.5 / 6.98s
Drones (bandwidth / bay): 0 / 0
Targeting (max targeting range / Scan Resolution / Max Locked targets): 40km / 375 / 7
Sensor strength: 11 Ladar
Signature radius: 50
Cargo capacity: 430

We will of course be looking for feedback on these stats and bonuses in the comments thread, as well as on our Singularity test server once the ship is available for player testing there.

But that’s not all!

We are also making some adjustments to projectile weapons in the Tiamat release, to help tweak their balance and ensure that players have the best possible variety of viable tactics to choose from.

These changes will be familiar to those of you who remember our energy weapon tweaks from the Rhea release, as they are once again focused on two goals: improving the quality of small artillery weapons slightly and reducing the reliance of all autocannon weapons on their ‘Barrage’ Tech Two ammo.



**Small Artillery:**

In Tiamat we are making some adjustments to small artillery weapons to help keep them in line with other similar weapon systems. We will be increasing damage multipliers slightly while reducing tracking speed.

All small artillery will be receiving:
+10% damage multiplier
-3% tracking speed
