TECH III SUBSYSTEM BALANCING
Other changes that are coming for Phoebe are the removal of Data Interface and Subsystem Data Interfaces. Those will be properly reimbursed at market price. Blueprint copies will be reimbursed at a static price.

With the removal of those items, players will be able to directly pick and choose the exact race and subsystem type they want instead of relying on a random number generator (RNG) mechanic.

Below is the updated UI for picking subsystems:



To compensate for this and to stimulate the market for Tech III materials, some changes are being made to the build requirements of various Tech III components.

Exact changes below:

Adding 1 Neurovisual Output Analyzer to Electronic, Engineering and Propulsion subsystems
Adding 1 Nanowire Composites to Offensive subsystems

Increasing the Methanofullerene use in Fulleroferrocene Power Conduits to 60 (+27)
Decreasing the Scandium Metallofullerene use in Reinforced Metallofullerene Alloys and Warfare Computation Core to 22 (-22)
DECRYPTOR MERGING:
As part of our effort to remove needless complexity from EVE, racial decryptors are now going to be merged into one set of generic decryptors which affect all races in the same way. Decryptors will also now affect Ancient Relics.

So, for example, if you had an Occult Accelerant and Esoteric Accelerant Decryptor in your hangar, you will now receive 2x Accelerant Decryptors when Phoebe goes live.

As an added bonus, Cosmos items will no longer require Decryptors as part of their manufacturing requirements.

MULTI-INVENTION OUTCOME AND INVENTION TEAMS
These two features will not be going live for Phoebe.

After some discussion we arrived to the conclusion that multi-invention outcome, while adding a beneficial impact on this activity, was annoying with large industry batches and messing with players wishing to accurately predict long term job outcomes.

So we instead decided to spend our time working on force projection changes, which we’re sure you can agree was a much more pressing problem to address for this particular release.

Regarding invention teams, we are currently investigating the purpose and state of teams in the game as a whole.

In all cases, we hope you are going to appreciate the invention changes we have been working on for Phoebe. Manufacture safely out there and may the invention RNG gods be with you.
