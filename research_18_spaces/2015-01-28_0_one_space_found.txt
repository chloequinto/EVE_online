New UI Icon Additions and More Themed UI Elements

Following up from the revamped user interface released in Rhea, Tiamat brings a few new user interface icons and more interface elements are themed by the selected color theme. Read the patch notes for the full list of changes.

Visual Updates to Structures in Missions and other Locations

Shaders and effects for structures and objects found in sites are updated in Tiamat, along with rending performance improvements.

Quality Settings for Sun Flares

Tiamat brings quality settings to sun flares, improving performance by providing a less resource-intensive version of the effect on lower quality settings.

Atmosphere Sounds for Pirate Faction Structures

New sound atmosphere is added to Pirate Faction structures in sites and mission locations.

Firing Aftershock Sound for Turret Weapons

Turret weapon firing sound effects become richer in Tiamat through the addition of aftershock sound for individual shots.

Audio Engine Performance Improvements

An upgrade of the audio engine brings performance improvements to the EVE client as a whole in Tiamat.

Tiamat Theme Music

With Tiamat comes another soundtrack from our audio and music team. It will be up on our SoundCloud Page as soon as it’s done!

In the weeks leading up to EVE Fanfest you’ll see more communication from the EVE team about features coming to EVE in 2015, such as upcoming steps on improving sovereignty mechanics. The EVE Keynote at Fanfest will give the next big update on the big picture roadmap for EVE. It’s best viewed in person so grab your tickets and I’ll see you there!

Enjoy the Tiamat changes, you can check out many of the features on Singularity already.
