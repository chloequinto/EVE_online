Beginning today, Friday, May 1st 2015 through to 23:59:59 on Friday May 15th 2015, CCP will be accepting PLEX for GOOD donations from our players.

For each PLEX donated during this period, CCP will contribute USD $15 to the Icelandic Red Cross to fund their aid efforts in Nepal.

To make your PLEX for GOOD donation:

Contract one or more PLEX to the "CCP PLEX for GOOD" character on a 14-day item exchange contract.
Contracts will be accepted within 24 hours of submission, though usually sooner than that.
Please ensure the receiving character is the one named above, and double check the character is in the C C P Corporation to avoid contracting PLEX to the incorrect character. CCP cannot guarantee the return of PLEX contracted to the wrong character.

Once again, as we say with every PLEX for GOOD drive, we cannot thank the EVE Community enough for the support, encouragement and dedication that you all show to the PLEX for GOOD program.

Previous PLEX for GOOD drives  have resulted in donations totaling over $340,000 to those in need during natural disasters in Japan, Haiti, Pakistan, and the United States, with the last PLEX for GOOD drive raising an astonishing $190,890 for those affected by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines during November 2013.

As a gesture of thanks, for each PLEX you donate CCP will give you two virtual in-game t-shirts: the Sisters of EVE Food Relief “'Humanitarian' T-shirt YC117” (one male and one female) for use in EVE to show your support for PLEX for GOOD. These t-shirts are currently being designed, and will be distributed with a later release once they are finalized. Here’s a preview of what they’re going to look like:
