WAIT? NO MORE ANALYSIS KREDITS?
Yup, that’s right… but no cause for concern!

Project Discovery has now found a new and permanent home with the CONCORD Assembly. Going forward, Analysis Kredits will no longer be awarded as part of the rewards.

While you’ll no longer be able to earn AK, you’ll still be able to spend it in the same way you currently can, so no pilot will lose out on any rewards from phase one of Project Discovery.

The only difference that will occur is that with the start of phase two of the project, the display of AK balance will be removed from the Project Discovery interface. You will however still be able to see which phase one rewards you can and cannot afford in the Sisters of EVE loyalty point store as usual.

The idea with this change is to both show solid and measurable progression through Project Discovery, and simplify the issue of rewards so that they’re place directly into your redeeming system and are easier to collect.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO PHASE ONE?
Phase one of Project Discovery will be disabled during daily downtime on Tuesday, July 4th in order for CCP and MMOS to begin prepping the infrastructure for the release of phase two.

That means that if you still want to play phase one, this weekend is your last chance to do so!

Project Discovery will remain offline for one week during these preparations, before phase two is launched on July 11th with the deployment of the July release.

CAN I TRY OUT PHASE TWO NOW?
You sure can! Phase two of Project Discovery is currently in testing on Singularity, the EVE Online public test server.

You can find more about testing phase two in this forum thread, and you can find out more about how to connect to Singularity for public testing here!

As always, we welcome your comments, suggestions and feedback. Feel free to chat in the comments thread for this dev blog and let us know what you think!
