On behalf of CCP I would like to thank the delegates of CSM9 for their hard work over the last term and congratulate the newly elected delegates of CSM10 on their new roles.

We would also like to thank everyone who participated in voting this year. Please feel free to contact us if you have any suggestions or feedback about the Council.
