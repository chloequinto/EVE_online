When a new notification is received, you will get a small pop-up with some basic text content and a small image associated with the category of the notification. If you want to know more about this particular event, just click on the notification pop-up and we’ll open the most appropriate game window for you.

If you get several notifications at once they will stack up and eventually queue if the stack limit is reached. The size of the stack can be configured and is set at 3 as a default.  If you haven’t interacted with the pop-ups for a few seconds they will automatically fade. This fade time is also completely configurable.

Next up, history view!  Clicking the notification widget will expand a history view that shows all the notifications you’ve received, up to a limit of (we aren’t sure on limit yet).  Again, clicking particular notifications in the history view will open up the most relevant feature/window.  The history view will collapse itself if the mouse goes somewhere else or you click on the widget a second time.

Finally, and maybe most importantly, the options! We know this feature runs the risk of being too noisy to be useful for you savvy veterans, so we’ve tried to make it as customizable as possible to make sure you are getting the information you need instead of just getting spammed. In this screen you can control whether a certain notification type or entire category give you a pop-up, a sound, a history entry, or nothing at all.
