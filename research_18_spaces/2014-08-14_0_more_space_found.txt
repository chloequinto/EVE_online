If this initial wave of Burner Missions is successful, we will consider expanding the concept with more frigate enemies (EAFs anyone?) and possibly even cruiser sized versions.

We expect that these missions will provide a fun and engaging bit of variety to the lives of mission runners in EVE, and that they will allow players to make use of some ships and tactics that otherwise wouldn’t be part of their everyday EVE experience.

We look forward to hearing your feedback on these mission in the feedback thread. What are you looking forward to most about these Burner Missions? What do you think could be improved about the concept? What kinds of new mission types would you like to see us add next?

These Burner Missions will be showing up in your agent offers starting with the Hyperion release on August 26th. To see even more about all the improvements that are coming with Hyperion, check out CCP Seagull’s dev blog here.

Fly safe!
