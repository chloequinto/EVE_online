FAQ
Q) Can I continue working on the application after submitting it to be judged?

A) Yes of course! However, since we will be judging the repo you submit through the Google Doc form, you should not push any changes to it after the deadline or you could disqualify yourself. Feel free to have the link you send us be a fork from your main repo where you continue working though.

Q) Can I participate if I don't have an active subscription?

A) Yes you can! If you wish to integrate the SSO or any part of authenticated CREST you will need to register an application on developers.eveonline.com which does have the requirement that you have paid for something from us in the past.
