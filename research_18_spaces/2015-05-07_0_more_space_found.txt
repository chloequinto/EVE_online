**PREVIOUSLY, IN THE MOSAIC RELEASE**
Those of you who read the forums, watch the o7 show on our Twitch.tv channel, or read the Mosaic release patchnotes already know that a few important improvements were made to the Sovereignty system last week with the Mosaic deployment. I want to quickly highlight these changes here as well, to ensure that every player is completely up to date.

INFRASTRUCTURE HUB AND INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADE VOLUMES AND MANUFACTURING
One area changed in the Mosaic release was the Infrastructure Hubs and their Upgrades. We reduced the volume of Infrastructure Hubs and Infrastructure Upgrades so that they can be deployed more easily, and we also made all of the Infrastructure Upgrades manufacturable by players instead of selling them directly from NPCs.

The volumes of IHubs and Upgrades have been reduced to:

Infrastructure Hubs: 60,000 m3
Military/Industrial upgrades: From 5,000 m3 to 60,000 m3 (depending on the level)
Strategic Upgrades: 200,000 m3
This allows IHubs and Military/Industrial upgrades to all be deployed by a wider variety of ships including Deep Space Transports. Strategic Upgrades still require at least a Jump Freighter or Freighter.

To go along with these changes we have enabled the deploying of all structures (including Starbase Control Towers) from fleet hangars, so that ships like Orcas and Deep Space Transports will have more structure deployment options.

We have also made all of the IHub upgrades manufacturable using PI materials. Blueprints are sold by the Empire Navy corporations, and the material requirements consist of Tier 4 PI Commodities and Capital Construction Parts.

More details about these changes can be found in this forum thread.

ORE, MINERAL AND NULLSEC MINING ANOMALY REVAMP
For the Mosaic release we deployed a huge set of changes to minerals, blueprints and ores aimed at improving nullsec, lowsec, and wormhole mining and enabling stronger nullsec industry. Anyone who has been watching the mineral markets will have already noticed the major impact this shakeup is having on mineral prices.

These changes are intended to make Nullsec more self-sufficient then it is currently. We continue to believe that no area of space should be completely independent of any other, but there is a lot of room to make nullsec more self-sufficient and improve the opportunities for zero-sec miners and industrialists.

These changes consist of three parts:

Increasing Zydrine and Megacyte consumption in manufacturing
Rebalancing the mineral content of the Null and Lowsec focused ores
Rebalancing the ore content of the mining anomalies generated by the Ore Prospecting Array
**Increasing Zydrine and Megacyte consumption in manufacturing.**
This is a fairly simple change, but it will have some significant effects. As first mentioned on the o7 show, we are doubled the Zydrine and Megacyte consumption of almost all blueprints in the game. This will bring the universe-wide consumption of Zydrine and Megacyte closer to some of the original designs for overall mineral consumption, and will provide a very significant boost to Nullsec (including wormhole) and to a lesser extent Lowsec mining.

**Rebalancing the mineral content of the Null and Lowsec focused ores.**
This is the big set of changes that will enable a healthier Nullsec mining environment. Each of the "Nullsec ores" have been rebalanced to focus on one main mineral (except for Spodumain which is more widely distributed between four mineral types). This allows us to adjust the supply of each mineral in Nullsec to bring overall balance closer to the actual mineral consumption from the average industry job. It also makes it much easier for players to decide what ore to mine if they find themselves in need of a specific mineral. We are also making somewhat smaller sets of changes to the "Lowsec ores" to clean up their mineral spread and increase their value.
The following values are for a theoretical 100% refine of a batch of each ore type. The upgraded versions of each ore will continue to contain +5% and +10% minerals as they did before. Volumes of each ore did not change in this pass.

**Rebalancing the ore content of the mining anomalies generated by the Ore Prospecting Array**
With these changes, the total mineral supply gained by mining out an entire Ore Prospecting Array anomaly (other than the small belts) will now more closely match the average mineral consumption across the EVE universe, allowing alliances to more easily source the bulk of their raw minerals locally for industrial activities. The relative compositions of each anomaly are slightly different, allowing each corporation or alliance to decide which best matches their personal industrial activities.

Mercoxit: 7000
The ore compositions of other mining anomalies found within Nullsec, Lowsec, and Wormhole space have not changed, but the mineral changes will cause the value of mining those anomalies to rise significantly as well.

We have also updated the rate at which mining and NPC killing contributes to the current Sovereignty system indices. Since Mosaic, mining now builds the Industrial Index much more quickly than before, and ratting now builds the Military Index slightly slower than before.

Together, these changes represent a huge shift in how minerals are obtained in Nullsec. We have already seen significant increases in overall Nullsec mining volume in the first week since these changes and we hope that many miners will find themselves free to choose between multiple viable locations to ply their trade.

Thanks for joining us for this update dev blog, and I hope you are all as excited as we are to see the results of our upcoming summer releases. As always, we welcome feedback on all the updates described in this blog, as well as all other aspects of the new designs.
