CCP Seagull
Executive Producer - EVE Online

2014 has been a year full of some really big changes to how we develop EVE Online. Almost every process for EVE development is touched by the change in how we release updates to EVE Online, and the structure and working processes for the CSM are no exception.

The 9th Council of Stellar Management have made great contributions to EVE Online during this year, giving us feedback on both designs for EVE and tricky community issues such as input multiplexing.

My goal for 2015 and how we work with the next CSM is twofold: To make it easy for EVE development teams to work with the CSM, and to find ways to give CSM more empowerment and direct access to information about development and plans so that they can keep bringing the player perspective into the heart of development of EVE Online.

I want to say a great thank you to CSM9 for all their work and contributions to EVE Online in the past year, and I look forward to working with the next council. I hope that all players take the opportunity to vote for people who can represent your perspective in EVE.

CSM Coordinator

Despite some challenges in transitioning to the new release model in the latter half of the term, the performance and dedication of the delegates of CSM 9 has been exemplary, and we are looking forward to working with the next council in 2015, with the hope that many of the CSM 9 delegates will be successfully re-elected to continue their work.

Keep an eye on our official forums and this Devblog feed for more information regarding the CSM, and details of the upcoming candidacy and election periods for CSM X.

Fly safe,

CCP Leeloo and the Ninth Council of Stellar Management
