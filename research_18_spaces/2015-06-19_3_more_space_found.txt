When redesigning the Dominix we thought about keeping the retro-feel of this old warhorse, so the silhouettes and base design aesthetics are quite similar to the original version. Now we finally have a small window to dive into this very much awaited project.  CCP Bluescreen is relentless these days building the asset and getting it ready for the texturing phase.  We are very excited to see the final version and it will hit your hangars in the upcoming release in August.



Minmatar ships are also getting some focus on the redesign front these days.  We are constantly looking to evolve the style and feel to our spaceships in our efforts to modernize the ships of New Eden. Sometimes we go for bold designs, changing things up a lot from the original versions. At other times minimal changes are required.  It’s a fine line in the direction we decide to take.  Here are some ideas we are working with at the moment. 

These are still works in progress, not planned for any release at this stage, but will give you an idea on what we are thinking.
