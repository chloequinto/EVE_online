As the development pace begins to temporarily slow over the holiday period and your weapons cool off for a well deserved break, we’d like to offer the community our most sincere thanks for another amazing chapter in EVE’s history. As is customary this time of the year, we’d also like to offer a set of holiday gifts in celebration of the season and the amazing journey that we’ve experienced over the course of the last year.

The redeeming system of every paying EVE account has been credited with the following:

2x Festival Launchers
500x Snowballs
200x Barium Fireworks
200x Copper Fireworks
200x Soduim Fireworks
1x Male “Outlaw” Jacket
1x Female “Outlaw” Jacket
In addition to these items, all players will receive twenty holiday trinkets marking some of the more famous (and infamous) events of the last 12 months, and celebrating a number of achievements within the community. Some of our eagle eyed players will have noticed a few of these already, including Chribba's Modified Strip Miner, The Galactic Party Planning Guide, and the infamous SoxFour's Spaceboots.

And finally, we’d like to offer 20 days of multiple character training free to every EVE Online account as part of our thanks for a fantastic year. You can activate the multiple character training by visiting this link, which requires login through single-sign on (SSO).

All these gifts are ready to be redeemed now, and will be available for you to claim until January 11th, 2015. Also, if you reactivate an account before then, the holiday gifts will be available to you to claim as normal.

We hope that you've has as much fun this year as we've had watching you all continue to shape the EVE Universe and make your mark on New Eden.

From all of us at here CCP, to all of you who make up the backbone of New Eden and the most awesome gaming community on Earth, have an amazing holiday season!

Happy Holidays, and best wishes for 2015!
