Let’s go into a little more detail on how they are going to work:

Player reprocessing skills will be taken into account
Reprocessing time is instant. No more waiting one hour or even 10 seconds for the outcome minerals
Ore, ices and gas clouds may now be mixed together at the same time inside the structures – but modules cannot be moved inside the Reprocessing Arrays.


Reprocessing is done via a simple right-click > reprocess option, which of course can be used on multiple ores at once.


The Intensive Reprocessing Array may only be used in low-security solar systems and below. The standard Reprocessing Array, meanwhile, may be used everywhere, including 1.0 security systems.
Compression Arrays
Firstly we want to mention that we have further simplified how compression is generally going to work:

Instead of requiring various amounts of ore to compress as expressed here, compression now requires 100 units of the base ore to deliver one unit of compressed variation.
Volumes on compressed ores have been tweaked to preserve the same ratios as mentioned in our “reprocess all the things” blog, so the ratios shouldn’t change.
Compression blueprints are being removed and properly reimbursed.
Example: I have 100 units of Veldspar in the Compression Array with a total volume of 10m3. After compressing them I will receive 1 unit of Compressed Veldspar with a volume of 0.15m3 (this may displayed as 0.2 in the client due to how rounding works).

Secondly, we are introducing a Starbase Compression Array. With perfect reprocessing rates being no longer achievable, this structure becomes quite important to faciliting the movement of ore. Here are the attributes.



Compression works in a similar way to reprocessing:

It’s instant with no cooldown
Ores and ices of different types may be compressed at the same time
