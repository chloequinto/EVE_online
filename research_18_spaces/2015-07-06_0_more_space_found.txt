Here is some of what CCP Fozzie has to say about this little monster, “With 5 turrets and a 5% RoF bonus, the Hecate enjoys 10 effective turrets, one more than the Confessor and Svipul. It is also the first T3 destroyer with an active tanking bonus. Since both the damage bonus and the active tank bonus come in the form of RoF reductions, capacitor will be a definite challenge for the Hecate and cap boosters should be common.”

That’s all for now! Fly safe and we’ll see you next time.
