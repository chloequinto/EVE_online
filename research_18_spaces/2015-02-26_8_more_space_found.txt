The new Ship Group Icons are almost identical to the old ones but with slight important iterations to help identify them more easily on their own.

So we decided to take on the icons in the Overview and make sure to never have the situation where an icon was used for multiple things that had different role, function or purpose.

What are we changing?

We decided to look at all things that can be displayed in the Overview and put them into 4 primary categories:

Ships - All man-made objects in space that can travel/move
Structures - All man-made objects in space that don’t travel or move
Celestials - All objects in space that are not man-made
Other - Anything that doesn’t fit the definition of the other groups
SHIPS

Once we had iterated on the Ship Groups we wanted to also tackle NPC ships and make them consistent so that all ship groups would have the same base look. We re-authored all icons tied to NPCs, making them visually consistent with player ships with an added ‘+’ icon in the upper-right corner to identify NPC ships specifically. This was to address the fact that some NPCs can be neutral and are therefore displayed in the same white color as player ships but also to ensure that we are not using color as the primary method of identification but rather as a secondary emphasis. This is part of our ongoing mission to use shapes as the primary way of identifying UI objects, which should cater specifically well to those with color blindness, but is also simply a proven preferred way for all humans to store information.
