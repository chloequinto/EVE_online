In addition to this, the GM Team team also man a twitter account, where you can find tips and tricks, along with messages regarding current issues and further community resources for learning more about the world of EVE.

As well as these resources, over the coming week, members of CCP Staff will be on hand to assist you in the rookie help channel, and in some instances in local too! We'll be making a tour of New Eden now and then to see how new players are getting along with their first steps in the world of EVE. You can identify members of CCP staff by the prefix "CCP" before our names, and blue text in chat windows.

We pride ourselves on the strength and dedication of our community, and hope that you'll have an awesome time getting to know fellow EVE players as you take your first steps into New Eden. We're extremely humbled and proud of our community after watching the huge level of support our amazing players have shown rookie players over the course of this weekend.

Go join them, forge your own destiny in EVE and make your mark on the universe; but most importantly of all, have fun doing so!

Good luck, pilots!
