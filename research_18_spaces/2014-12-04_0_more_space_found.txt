These modes can also be resized and makes it very easy to run the map on a second monitor full time. AMAZING.

ZOOMING

We are working towards consolidating the solar system map and the star map into one seamless map. You can see the beginnings of this work by zooming in (by using the mouse wheel, double clicking or control clicking) on any system. The map will seamlessly zoom all the way down to the solar system level, showing you the location of stations and stargates. For now, using scan probes will still only be possible in the old solar system map but hopefully before long we can integrate that, together with more solar system scale functions, into the new map.

In addition to those major changes, there is a range of smaller ones:

You can now use the ‘grouping’ options to show the map at region or constellation level, rather than only showing all the stars at once

You can mark a home station with a label
The display of statistics and filters has been normalized in some cases to improve readability
The code that handles ‘picking’ has been rewritten which should improve the feel of system selection
We have a lot of work going into performance improvement, largely to help support windowed mode.
All that being said, there are some things missing or not workingthis is a beta after all. Here are a few that we know of and will be dealing with as soon as possible:

No search functionality
No jump range visualization for ships with jump drives
The map won’t currently load if you’re in a wormhole
The sovereignty filter hasn’t been hooked up yet
There’s probably more that we haven’t mentioned here but just remember this is an experimental feature and we will be adding features and functionality consistently over the coming weeks and months.

BUT CCP RISE, THIS STILL ISN’T DOTLAN
You’re right and we hear you. I have two different replies to this question. Hopefully both make you excited for the future.

First, this is only step one for the star map. After we gather feedback from the beta and validate the big new functions I mentioned above, we are planning to a take a hard look at what kind of strategic value is present in the map currently and then find ways to add to that value. The results of this work could be anything from a ‘recent filters’ list to help you switch statistics displays more easily to the removal of useless filters to a jump planner. Keep your eye out for these changes in January and February and make sure to give us feedback on this subject in the meantime.

Second, we aren’t releasing it just yet, but we are hard at work on developing a dedicated two-dimensional, ”DOTLAN-esque” mode for the map which will be focused entirely on strategy and information. This mode looks very promising but we’ve chosen to hold off for the Rhea release in order to focus completely on the updated 3d map so that you get the best feature possible for Rhea. Look for progress reports on the tactical map after Rhea.

OK, ENOUGH TALK, HOW DO I TURN IT ON
Just like past beta features, simply open up the escape menu by pressing ESC and in the lower left section of the ‘General Settings’ tab you should see an option to enable the new map.

Once clicked, you will get a second map icon in the Neocom with a small beta tag on it. Click on that and bam, new map.

Your participation in beta features is very much appreciated and we can’t wait to see what you think of our new map. Once you’ve checked it out, post your thoughts in the comments thread for this dev blog so that we can make the map the best it can be before we release it officially.
