To be clear CCP does not officially endorse or support overlays and therefor does not guarantee that they work or don't cause unexpected problems with the EVE Online client.

We are aware that this will have a negative impact on some player’s experience but it is also something we feel is necessary to ensure the safety of users using our client.

That is all for now. We will be monitoring the comments to answer any questions you may have.

*Note on Overwolf. It used to be that it only worked on DX9 and not DX11 for EVE. That is actually the reverse now and it does work for DX11.
