The price ranges for a single item in the first iteration will go from 45 AUR (for a frigate ship skin) to 1500 AUR (for the full sleeve ‘Wreckage’ tattoo), while the 10 run blueprints will range from 400 Aurum (10 frigate skins) to 3000 Aurum (10 battleship skins). We will be offering more items in the future at a faster rate than previously and there will be regular sales and special offers. 

With the release of the New Eden Store, we will stop selling Aurum Tokens and start selling Aurum directly instead. Existing Aurum Tokens can still be redeemed for Aurum – we will just stop selling new ones. You can also continue to convert your PLEX into AUR like previously. Coupled with the AURUM sales we are changing the pricing structure. You will now get slightly more AURUM when purchasing directly.

The new Aurum prices are as follows:

A NEW STORE EXPERIENCE
The new store offers all the conveniences of filtering, whether that is by ship skins or apparel, for male or female characters or more. There is also a search available so you can quickly find your favorite item.
