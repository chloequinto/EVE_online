In short, this is the book that tells you what you’ve been flying all those years. Aside from a very cool cutaway of an Algos in EVE Source, and some very early blueprints on the EVE website over fifteen years ago, very little has been done in terms of revealing the intricate details of the engineering marvels you pilots command. CCP was lucky enough to work with an amazing artist, Will Burns, who had worked for CCP prior, and dedicated over a year of his life to the painstaking task of illustrating 28 frigates. Will worked closely with the art and story teams to ensure that we have the most up-to date, accurate and aesthetically pleasing representation of EVE´s ships and innards available.
