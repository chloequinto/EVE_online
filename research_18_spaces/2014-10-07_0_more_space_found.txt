We will be periodically accepting all the donation contracts assigned to each character, at which point the donation becomes official and is counted towards the score.

It does not matter which station you make the contracts from.

These characters belong to their respective NPC Navy Corporations; remember to double check that you are contracting the items to the correct character.

This event is open now, and will run until downtime on Tuesday, October 14th.

We will be periodically updating a post in the comments thread for this blog with the latest donation numbers for each faction, but we will not be publishing any information about how many items any individual has donated (other than to congratulate the four winners at the end).

We’re very happy to be opening up this new way that players can influence the lore and history of EVE, and we can’t wait to take the lid off of the new tech that it will unlock.

This is only the beginning.
