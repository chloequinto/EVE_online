As normal, we saw the most number of people voting on the first two days of the election. Unlike most years though, the second day of voting saw a significantly higher number of votes than the first, but this was due to server issues that also affected the voting portal on the first day of the elections.

We’re looking forward to working with CSM 11 over the course of the next year to help us make EVE Online a better game for everyone. We hope we’ll succeed in keeping you all better updated with the process and we know the CSM are very keen to increase the visibility of our work together this term. A big shout out to those who voted and those who helped spread awareness of space democracy, such as EVE Vote Match, CSM Watch and more. Upwards and onwards!
