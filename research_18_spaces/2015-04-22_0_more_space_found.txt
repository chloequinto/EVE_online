Sometimes we announce things well up ahead, such as our planned changes to the Sovereignty system, but most of the time you'll see things on EVE Updates a few weeks before an update to EVE will go out.

If you've taken a break from EVE, you'll also be able to look in the Archive on EVE Updates, to see what features have been released since you were away. We are working on populating the detailed feature information for past releases, at least for 2014, to help those coming back to EVE after a break. 

So, that's EVE Updates and the coming Mosaic update on April 28th - enjoy!
