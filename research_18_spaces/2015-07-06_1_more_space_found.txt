Even though we have chipped away at the Ishtar’s power, and even though it’s popularity does seem to be in decline, it’s still pushing around twice as much pvp damage as other top tier ships so we don’t feel too bad going for one final tweak to it.

In Aegis we will be making the following changes to the Ishtar:

One mid slot removed, one low slot added
Power grid lowered from 780 to 740
Mass decreased from 1,100,000 to 1,060,000
Velocity decreased from 185m/s to 175m/s
Agility increased from .52 to .56
Overall this should lead to a huge decrease in power for the vastly more popular shield fits, and especially for those using 100mn afterburners.

We’ve done a lot of talking about the Ishtar in the last few months, but drone bonused ships in general have been performing extremely well. The Gila, Dominix, Tristan, Vexor, Vexor Navy Issue, and Stratios all make top lists for usage and damage in their respective classes. For this reason, in Aegis we will also be making a small nerf to all Drone Damage Amplifiers.

You can find the details of that change in this forum thread.

We were looking into a set of Battleship and Battlecruiser changes as well, but unfortunately we had to delay most of that pass until a later release. One of the intended adjustments will make its way into Aegis though, a nice buff for the Tempest.

The Tempest’s Minmatar Battleship bonus to rate of fire will increase from 5% per level to 7.5% per level.

And to finish things up, let’s not forget the best flying wing to be invented since Kit Cloudkicker’s ride in Tailspin, the Hecate.
