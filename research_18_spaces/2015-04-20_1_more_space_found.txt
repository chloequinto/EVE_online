While anchoring the structure, the nanocontainer projects a blueprint of what is being built in space, which represents the final form of the structure. The structure is then printed by lasers using the materials in the material tanks.

              

When unanchoring the structure, the nanocontainer will start the process of deconstructing the structure from the inside out. The lasers are used to melt the structure and collect the materials back into the material tanks, so the structure can be constructed somewhere else at a later date.

              

The shader created for this effect is the first shader for EVE that uses Geometry Shaders. This means that only users running the client with DirectX 11 will experience the lasers assembling and disassembling their structures. Users running with DirectX 9 will unfortunately will not witness the glory of nanites, as shown below:

                     

The videos above are sped up due to the long time it takes to anchor and unanchor most structures. To give you a better feel for how this looks ingame in realtime, here is a special bonus video:
