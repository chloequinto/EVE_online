Screenshots from the Mac client showing visual effects improvements that are included in the latest build.

In the Kronos release, the development has been focused on improving the overall customer experience for players running the EVE client on the Mac. The update brings a much needed improvement to the overall visceral experience of EVE Online for Mac players. The following are some of the improvements you will see in Kronos:

Blinking point lights sprites are back.
Ships featuring fields and drone bays now have their force field effects back.
Anti-aliasing options now correctly affect antialiasing as they should.
Star fields no longer flicker if you are being shot.
Warp disruption bubble effects no longer flicker.
Improved compatibility with USB based headsets and microphones.
Support for Retina displays.
Fixes for some full-screen effects.
Corrupt clouds in high shaders are fixed.
Black graphical corruption in warp engine trails are fixed.
Transparent character models from using a combo of "low" post-processing and anti-aliasing are fixed.
You can expect to see several more dev blogs coming out before June 3rd, going into more detail on some of the features coming in Kronos.
