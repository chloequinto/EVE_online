This change in how we update EVE Online is an important part of how we will bring about some of the biggest changes EVE Online has seen in years, as part of our vision for a universe more and more controlled by capsuleers, all the way to them mastering the technologies of space travel and breaking out of the known universe.

The line of titan releases marching your way will bring more and better EVE to you, more often. Expansions were for the last decade - expanding EVE with release after release after release is what we'll do in this decade.

As we make this change, we want your feedback - tell us what you think and ask questions in the comment thread!
