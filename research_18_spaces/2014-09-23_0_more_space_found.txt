When you jump it‘s the gate that cloaks you. This effect is visually different from normal cloaking (done by your ship.

As before your own ship is the only one you will be able to see when it is fully cloaked, while you will only see the cloaking and uncloaking transitions for other pilots. These are cosmetic changes and cloaking will behave exactly as it does now from a game play point of view.

To see the effect in action, check out this video made by CCP Manifest. Please note that this was earlier in the development and therefore is a little outdated, but still quite cool.

Look forward to lots of transparent beauty come Oceanus on September 30th.

Fly safe. Fly cloaked.
