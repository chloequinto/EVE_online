THE MORDU'S LEGION GARMUR FRIGATE
Mordu's Legion ships are focused on three main themes: exceptional speed and agility, high missile range and damage, and longer warp scrambler/disruptor range. The Garmur frigate will be available in the Mordu's Legion Loyalty Point (LP) Store in the Pure Blind region, but it can also be attained by hunting down rare Mordu's Legion ships in asteroid belts in low security space.

For the full range of ship properties, see this forum thread from CCP Rise. For full details, keep your eyes open for a dev blog coming out soon, showing all the new Mordu's Legion ships in their full glory.



THE MORDU’S LEGION ORTHRUS CRUISER
As Mordu's Legion raises its profile in low security space as an elite mercenary and security force, they have also developed the deadly Orthrus cruiser, coming in Kronos. Like the other Mordu's Legion ships, this cruiser has big bonuses to missiles as well as warp scrambler and disruption range. The Orthrus is at the core of the Legion’s new strike formations and provides the mercenary pilots a ship for executing rapid attack maneuvers.



THE MORDU’S LEGION BARGHEST BATTLESHIP
The flagship of the new Mordu’s Legion fleet is the mighty Barghest. This Battleship was developed in response to emerging threats from the Guristas. It is designed as a fast battleship with high-speed missile delivery systems along with increased range for warp scramblers and disruptors, making it fully capable of contesting the field with more traditional heavy skirmishers.
