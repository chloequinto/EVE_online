We’ll let the numbers speak for themselves.

In total, between December 12th and December 19th, the EVE Community donated 3,730,320 PLEX through the purchase of “Blaze” Squadron SKINs. This is the equivalent of 620 YEARS of game time.

More importantly, it represents a donation of $119,828.50 USD that CCP will make to CCP Blaze’s family on behalf of the EVE Online Community.

To put the numbers into perspective, this is the second largest CCP hosted fundraiser that the EVE Community has contributed to, eclipsing all but one of the PLEX for GOOD drives in just seven days.

It’s honestly not possible for us to find words that would accurately convey the gratitude we feel to our pilots.

Once again, the EVE Community has shown that despite differences in game, our pilots are a formidable, and indestructible force for good.

From all of us, to all of you, our most sincere thanks for your support.
