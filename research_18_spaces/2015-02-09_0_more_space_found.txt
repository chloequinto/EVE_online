Custom message with rejection mails

Finding a character after you’ve rejected his application to send him an EVE mail with the reason why is not the greatest usability experience for our beloved players. That’s why we added an option to send a custom message with the corp rejection mail, and of course we know that you will only be sending those people love letters and kind words.



What next?

Because we know that you’re going to ask us about roles, and why we’re not fixing them, we want to let you know we’re working on it! Unfortunately you won’t see any of that work in Tiamat, but we will tell you more about that when we get closer to releasing it.
