In 2015, the community once again delivered an unbelievable level of charity support through the PLEX for GOOD program.



After a devastating earthquake hit Nepal and the surrounding region in May, the community rallied behind PLEX for GOOD and raised an astonishing $103,650 for the Icelandic Red Cross, bringing the total amount that the EVE Community has raised for PLEX for GOOD close to half a million US dollars.

With the donation from the EVE Community being one of the largest that the Icelandic Red Cross received, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, the President of Iceland came by to offer his thanks to the EVE Community for supporting such a worthwhile cause.
