Wealth of Unseen Art

This book contains a plethora of unseen material, along with some classics. We discovered that much of the original concept art from EVE was sitting in dark, musky drawers, deep in the bowels of the art department. Those were rescued, scanned and filed. For digital art, servers and backups were scoured. Every nook and cranny of the internal CCP network was crawled in a relentless art preservation and data gathering effort that would have made national museums and intelligence agencies proud. The art must be unearthed.



        

Dead End Thrills Screenshots

We have long been fans of Duncan Harris’ website Dead End Thrills. Duncan takes screenshots from popular games, often providing a novel perspective on worlds that we think we knew already. He has done so for EVE, with great success. We reached out to him and commissioned several new EVE screenshots especially for this book, and he graciously allowed us to reprint several others he had already made and shared with the public




Ground warfare illustrated

As well as containing hundreds of EVE Online concept images, this book contains a lot of previously unseen images from the surface of New Eden’s war-torn planets, illustrating the different terrestrial landscapes and installations, some of which are theatres of war for DUST battles.





In stations

What is behind The Door? Well, even though you can’t open it in EVE Online, you can still see what station interiors look like in the minds of our artists.
