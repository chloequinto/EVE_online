For those not familiar with the CSM, they are a player-elected representative body for the players to CCP. CSM members are involved in ongoing discussions with developers about the game and future changes being planned, bringing both community feedback and expert opinions. The council is also flown out to CCP Iceland twice a year for a multi-day summit with the development teams. To learn more about the CSM, head here.

For those of you wanting to see the votes themselves, they can be found here, alongside the code (in Python) used to run the election. The election is run using the same system as last year, the Wright STV system. More details on the formatting of the .blt file can be found here in section 3.1.

In total, we had 31,274 votes cast in the election for CSM 12. This is higher than last year but not a record.  CCP takes this as a sign that while we’ve improved awareness of the council, there is more that can be done to improve how we promote elections and increase belief in the CSM project

We also had an increase in the total number of candidates running from last year, tying for second highest ever. This ensured a healthy variety of candidates to choose from for voters and a lively campaign period.
