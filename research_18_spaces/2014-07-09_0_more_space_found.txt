Bracket list options

We are capping the list at 15 items in both modes, which reflects the pre-existing cap on the bracket listing. To raise this number carries with it some concerns regarding performance and we don’t believe there is a strong case for a higher number as things stand. The balance of feedback was against scrolling in the bounded mode and this again factors in the decision to cap the number at a manageable set of items.

The latest changes, with the list mode options, should shortly be available on the Singularity test server. These improvements will be made available on Tranquility in the Crius release as part of our ongoing player experience work.

As the in-space brackets are a completely different feature to tooltips per se, we have been concentrating initially on improving this key part of the UI. Now that this has been done, we will look at improving the experience with tooltips in later releases. In that regard we are looking at configuring tooltip behavior by category, which we think would allow for you to tune how tooltips display based on the relevance of the information to you.
