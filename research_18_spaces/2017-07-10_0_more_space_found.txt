PATCH DAY COMETH
With the arrival of such a massive Strategic Cruiser revamp comes a very significant patch-day transition process.

A lot will be changing on patch day and we want to reiterate that we highly encourage all players who will be flying T3 Cruisers at the time of downtime on July 11th get themselves into a safe location such as a friendly starbase or docked within a station/structure before the downtime begins.

All characters that have the Electronic Subsystem Technology, Amarr Electronic Systems, Gallente Electronic Systems, Caldari Electronic Systems, and/or Minmatar Electronic Systems skills trained will receive the skillpoints from these skills as unallocated skillpoints as well as isk reimbursement for the NPC cost of the skillbooks.
Any skills or datacores associated with Engineering Subsystems have been renamed to refer to “Core Subsystems”
Existing subsystems that are not fit to a Strategic Cruiser will be directly transformed into their closest functional equivalent found in the same subsystem slot under the new system.
Strategic Cruisers with subsystems fit to them will have their subsystems converted into new ones directly, and will receive one extra subsystem placed in their cargo hold (to ensure that players have the same number of subsystems before and after the patch).
Thanks for joining us today for this dev blog! We are excited to get these newly rebalanced Strategic Cruisers into all your hands with the July release. Thanks again to all the players who have provided feedback on these ships over the years and a special thanks to the focus group members.

Good hunting!
