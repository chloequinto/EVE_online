CHRISTMAS COLLECTIBLES!
It's been an interesting year for New Eden and what better way to commemorate it with a set of collectibles trinkets that have a little fun with both player and non-player backstory.



On December 24th, each active EVE Online account will also receive a set of 20 collectible special edition commodities that poke a little fun at some of the adventures and mishaps that have occured over the course of the last year. These will also appear in your redeeming system on character selection.

AND FINALLY...
Come join us at the Annual Luminaire Snowball fight, hosted by Commander A9 on December 20th at 21:00 EVE Time, where there'll be a few CCPers ready to have some fun with snowballs and fireworks. You can find out more about the snowball fight, the light shows and the planned secret Santa event by heading on over to this forum thread.

There'll be more information next week on additional Holiday offers, as well as another blog from Team Murder Services. Until then, we've got pirates to hunt down...
