We would like to reiterate that all profits from the sale of these SKINs will be donated directly to CCP Blaze’s fiancée and daughter on behalf of the EVE Online Community.

To honor CCP Blaze’s love for EVE Online and his many years as an EVE player, we’ve also chosen to write him into backstory as an immortalized part of New Eden’s history.

The description for this SKIN will read as follows:

“Blaze” Squadron SKIN (Permanent)

Designed by Angel Cartel engineers, and released as a tribute to the leader of the Dominations notorious “Blaze” hit and run squadron who was lost in battle in late YC119, this nanocoating was made available in very limited numbers for only six hulls.

Known only as “Blaze”, a name earned from both the trail of burning wreckage usually left in his wake and his appearance with a golden red beard, his squadron became his namesake after hundreds of daring raids against Republic Fleet assets.

Today, they wear his colors in honor of his legacy as one of the Angel Cartel’s most successful and notorious pirates.

“Gone, but never forgotten. His name lives on in all of you. Hoist his colors, and decimate anything that stands in your way.” Trald Vukenda – CEO, Dominations.
