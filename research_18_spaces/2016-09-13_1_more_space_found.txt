Before that, we all need to rally together to ensure New Eden is a safe place for our new Empress. Over the past year you have successfully overcome the Drifter attacks on Amarr regions, but there remains one last battle before the Coronation. 

A group of Amarr loyalists calling themselves ‘Purity of the Throne’ are less than satisfied about the results of the Succession Trials. They wanted someone on the throne who has descended from the noble, pure Amarr families and are out to stop the coronation at all costs.

They have decentralized their operations to avoid reprisal, so you will find their hideouts all across New Eden and they are easily identified as they fly Amarr ships with their golden hulls brazenly painted white. The Amarr Empire has declared all of their stored materials as freely claimable for capsuleers who defeat them, including additional stock of SKINs they keep on hand.

These sites are equally distributed across the cluster and they have created these unique SKINs for every Amarr Hull.
