After you hit finish, go to you desktop and right-click on the EVE icon that's just been added



This will bring up this box:



You have to add the following to the Target field:

/server:87.237.38.60

The Target field should look like this:



(Note that the Target field shows only the end of the string in the field.)

Hit the 'Apply' button, and then the EVE icon to start the launcher. When the launcher has downloaded the necessary minimum set of resources to start playing, the 'PLAY' button will turn from gray to yellow and you can fly away!





We should note that the initial set of resources that the client downloads is roughly around 300 MB, but you should make sure that you have plenty of disc space. The whole set of resources is more the 12GB, so you should make sure that you have this space available in your installation location. 

How do I try this (Mac)?

Grab the installer here. When it has downloaded, click the .dmg file and proceed with the installation. After the installation is complete, open Finder and highlight your EVE Online installation. Choose 'Show Package Contents', then select the 'Contents' folder and the 'MacOS' folder.  Now open a terminal, drag the launcher into the terminal and add /server:87.237.38.60. Hit enter and the launcher pointing to Duality will open.
