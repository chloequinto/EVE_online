Moving PLEX towards a more granular, and ultimately more flexible design got us thinking about doing the same for Skill Trading. Originally, we aimed to set the size of Skill Injectors and Extractors in a way that kept them small enough to trade conveniently, but large enough to represent a meaningful amount of skill points. We think we hit the latter goal well, using Injectors feels good. However, with a minimum price tag of around 650 million ISK, injectors can feel out of reach for many players, especially those early in their careers when a little boost here and there goes a long way.

With that in mind, we’re going to introduce a new type of Skill Injector that will be one fifth the size of a current injector, bringing Skill Trading into a more reasonable price range on the market for newer players.

How does this work?

Here is a summary of what’s changing in bullet point form:

Renaming of the current Skill Injector to ‘Large Skill Injector’
Introduction of a new injector called ‘Small Skill Injector’
Adding right-click option to break Large Injectors into 5x Small injectors or combine 5x Small Injectors into 1x Large Injector
Using a Small Skill Injector will award a maximum of 100,000 skill points and will give the following amounts, depending on total SP on the character using the Injector:
For characters with less than 5mil SP:  100k SP
For characters with 5mil – 50mil SP:  80k SP
For characters with 50mil – 80mil SP:   60k SP
For characters with more than 80mil SP:   30k SP
That’s pretty much it!

We hope you enjoy having a bite-size skill trading option and as always let us know what you think in the comments.
