All that said, as you can see from the example above, a training queue can now be many months long and it is certainly possible to construct a queue that will run for years, even with the 50 entry limit.

While making this change we have noted further areas for improvement and very much look forward to your feedback and ideas about the skill-training system and related gameplay.

Happy skill-planning!
