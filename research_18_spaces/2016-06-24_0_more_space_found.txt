For the past decade the Serpentis corporation has had an ace up its sleeve that has given its capital development program a major head start.

In YC107 Salvador Sarpati hijacked the FNS Molyneux, one of the giant Solteuer-class Titans that serve as the largest and most powerful vessels in the Federation Navy. Although the Molyneux was successfully able to retreat to Serpentis Prime, it faced strong opposition from capsuleers that responded to bounties placed by the Federation.

Reverse engineering the Molyneux has proved to be a boon for Serpentis and Guardian Angel engineers, allowing them to develop smaller capsuleer-capable supercapital ships of incredible power.

The Vendetta is built upon a heavily upgraded Nyx supercarrier hull with significant bonuses to both fighter hitpoints and speed. It also uses Serpentis technology to magnify the strength of stasis webifier burst projectors.

The Vanquisher is the most powerful supercapital to ever reach capsuleer hands. It is an upgraded titan with stronger hybrid damage, an extra lowslot and powerful stasis webifiers.

All the stats and details on these incredible ships can be found in this forum thread.

Five single-run Vendetta BPCs and five single-run Vanquisher BPCs will be available through the Shadow of the Serpent event. The top 5 highest scoring characters during the event will receive Vanquisher BPCs and characters placing 6-10 will receive Vendetta BPCs. After a short period of event exclusivity, BPCs for both of these ships will become available in the Serpentis LP store.

Like the Vehement, these ships require large amounts of capital components in addition to a supply of Serpentis Modified Capital Microprocessors to build.

We hope that you are looking forward to the Shadow of the Serpentis event as much as we are, and we wish you the best as you engage with its challenges.

Thanks and good hunting!
