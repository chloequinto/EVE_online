1/1/2015,what about adding a drone bay as a ship like this would seem to have a tendency to use automatic mechanical things for defense/offense
1/1/2015,"no. that's like saying that the people playing call of duty correctly are taking away the freedom of people who want to pretend that call of duty is a refugee saving simulator.i hate to break this to you, but you do not have any right to force the game to revolve around your delusions of how it should work.no, what it does is try and put handcuffs on the people who are playing the game correctly, for the sake of the people who are not. you do not have a right to be left alone in new eden. anywhere. so i ask you this, why are you trying to weaken an already weak mechanic? right now the defenders can snap their fingers and use the dec dodge exploit to make wars go away, now you want to slap some wackassed conditions on the attacker?you can do that the moment people aren't allowed to drop corp in a war, how about that?"
1/1/2015,"the thing is, you do currently have that option.i got sick of getting wardeced in highsec many years ago, and shortly after i ended up moving out to nullsec. wardecs don't mean **** in nullsec. pve, industry, mining, exploration, even missions are all available in nullsec. lots of renter corps are recruiting, or you can rent your own space. the thing about living in nullsec is that you can't delude yourself into thinking you're safe all the time.if you want to avoid wardecs, move to a place where they don't matter. after a couple months living there, you'll learn how to deal with people out to get you, and then even highsec wardecs won't matter to you, because you now know how to see and avoid hostiles."
1/1/2015,"damn, you couldn't contradict yourself any harder if you tried. besides the people who are 'not playing correctly' feel the exact same way, which brings us back to going around in circles. for the tenth time, this entire thread is not about wanting to be left alone. it's about high sec wardecs currently being used as a major griefing tool. purposely disrupting a specific play style purely for the sake of disrupting it, knowing that your enemy can't do anything in return. that sh*t is broken and needs to be fixed. no-one in this thread advocates wanting the ability to be left completely alone, because that would be silly in a game like eve. what this thread does advocate, though, is that game mechanics should be fair for both sides. in no circumstance should player group a be allowed to disrupt the game for player group b without player group b being able to do anything about it.currently, whenever a high sec industrial corp gets wardecced chances are they are outmatched in every way from the get go. fighting back would only serve to entertain the wardeccers and thus prolong the war (because hey! they shoot back! fun!). for a high sec industrial corp the only winning move during a wardec is not to fight and to deny the attacker their kills (effectively making them waste the cost of the dec). which means docking up or going to ridiculous lengths to move your operation for a week. that can not and should not be the way the game works. it's as simple as that.now you as a pvper on the attacking side of things may say 'well then go train pvp! go out in t1 frigs! if you can't defend your stuff you're not allowed to have it in the first place' and all kinds of solutions that require defending players to adapt to your play style. which brings me back to:high sec wardecs are broken. period. this thread asks for a solution that makes both sides happy. not something that makes one side happy (like right now). so instead of constantly pretending that everything is fine, try placing yourself in the defender's shoes for a moment and try to find a middle ground so something productive comes out of this thread."
1/1/2015,"poh-tay-toe... poh-tah-toe.one man's griefing is another man's gameplay. there is no real ""line in the sand"" because griefing outside of how ccp defines it is purely subjective.i can claim that all industrialists, miners, and traders are ""griefing me"" and my playstyle because i have no ability to stop them from jacking up prices on the market (outside of either doing market stuff myself or blowing up everything coming and going from a trade hub).welcome to eve where...- all play styles are interconnected to each other in some way.- the more interconnected certain opposing playstyles are, the more they inherrently disrupt each other (ex. building versus destroying)- one cornerstone of eve is that the game itself allows you to do everything you want... including upset other players. this is intended because you affect other players with each action you take. if you can build, others can destroy it. if you destroy, others can build to stop it.welcome to the reality that every small low-sec group has to deal with on a daily basis. except they have it worse (because of capitals and hotdropping).if your enemy is bigger, fly smarter and/or faster.if your enemy is smarter, fly bigger and/or faster.if your enemy is faster, fly bigger and/or smarter.if you enemy is all of the above... make yourself as annoying as possible to not be worthwhile.that is classic defeatism. bravo!what ever happened to the days when people would ask for ways to fight off unwanted wardecs? has the griffin, blackbird and other ewar ships become ""useless?""i remember in the not too distant past that when eve university was war decced they would fly groups of ecm, sensor dampening, tracking disruption ships. sure, quite a few of them died... but they made the entire war so frustrating for the aggressors they rarely declared war against them again. and the losses never really mattered due to insurance and cheapo fittings.as i pointed out on the first page;pvpers have the learn the basics of pve, industry, trading, and mining (otherwise they have trouble managing their money and equipment).what makes pveers, industrialists, traders, and miners so special that they should not have learn the basics of pvp and how to fight back?moreover... another cornerstone of eve is; if you can't defend it (however you can), you should not build it. no one is exempt or given ""special consideration"" with regards to that rule.instead of constantly pretending that everything is fine, try placing yourself in the defender's shoes for a moment and try to find a middle ground so something productive comes out of this thread.we are already at the ""middle ground"" compared to where we were 5 years ago.the biggest problem is not the system. it is the mentality of the players. that needs to change."
1/1/2015,"while i agree highsec wardecs have some issues, they lie in the lack of incentives to form and defend highsec corporations, not in their ability to enable non-consensual pvp between players. eve is a pvp game. highsec was always intended to be a place of conflict and struggle, not a place players can do industry in the absence of risk. but ok, i'll bite. what is your solution to allow players who do not like to participate in direct ship pvp to avoid it, without giving them they ability to opt-out of a war (either before or after it has started)? ccp has already tried to solve these apparently contradictory positions with the current mechanics. you are suppose to invite friends (which you can do for free) or hire mercenaries to defend you. eve is a mmorpg. if you don't like some aspect of the game (ship pvp in this case) you are suppose to find some people that do and offer your skills (in this case industry) or isk to complement your skills. what you are not suppose to do is come to the forums and complain that the game is ""broken"" because you refuse to use the tools available to defend yourself. i would be happy to discuss the merits of a specific proposal that would correct any imbalance with the current mechanics but from your posts, you seem to have nothing specific to point to other than they are ""broken"" and used to ""grief"". eve is all about ""griefing"" your rivals - it is a competetive sandbox where we are all vying for power and riches - it is not a space utopia simulator where everyone gets along. the last pass over the wardec mechanics gave all the cards to the defender (free allies, increased costs for the attacker, etc.) plus the trump card of dec shedding by folding and reforming a corp being no longer considered an exploit. i cannot see what else can be done to stack the deck in favour of the defender. there is a place for industrialists in this game - building things is an integral part of eve. if you find building things fun, then there are ways you can do only that in the game. but if so, you will have to find allies somewhere to protect your assets because destruction is the opposite side of the coin and equally integral. if you cannot accept both as part of eve, then perhaps this is not the game for you."
1/1/2015,why? why put a mechanic in the game that is too costly to use?
1/1/2015,indeed. the changes to the scan mechanics is only doing it half way . we allready have a constant scan cirkle giving us intell about anoms in the system . why not make dscan automated aswell ? ofc this would make life in wh more intresting :)
1/1/2015,"from the first post:""if elected the single most important thing on my agenda is csm reform.""you have been singularly uninformative about what exactly it is you intend to reform, and how."
1/1/2015,"greetings tora,1) what do you think about completely removing faction police (the npcs that chase neg sec status dudes)?would it bring lots more content in highsec? for example:. lowsec pirates (like me) freely roaming around and engaging other pirates / gankers. pirates & gankers spending lots more time in space, being potential targets to anti-gankers or whoeveri have no idea how this would affect ganking balance, but maybe:2) coupled with this, and expanding on your hideout idea, why not make highsec stations unaccessible to neg sec status players (based on current progression: 1.0 unaccessible to -2.0 and below, etc.)?. neg status players could base in lowsec, to roam highsec (bringing more content to lowsec, too!). now, both sides of high/low gates could be camped! . organized ganking ops (such as code.) would probably need pos, which would be attackable --> more content here, toomake space glamorous! is eve dying or not? ask the eve-o death-o-meter!"
1/1/2015,"this is true, which is why i thanked him for his honesty. we've run into corps that are all, ""yeah, yeah, we run clean comms"" when they're recruiting us, and then we go to the trouble of moving out, joining them, getting on comms and it's a stream of lazy language. i've learned to appreciate people who are up-front about how they choose to do things.but my point wasn't that he's ~doing it wrong~, it's that it's not his motives or personal beliefs that are the issue, as his ""if you're asking"" sentence assumes. the mere presence of the language is enough to put some people off."
1/1/2015,"yes u re right, and so is june, u can find alot of recordings of my comms on u tube, feel free, or join in on a roam, i dont mind. 10 k poeple available for fleets means 10 k different people , i dont mind rude language as long as its not pointed to harm a individual that is present. i am not running a children day care centre but a x rated game when it comes to adult language. eve has shown with charity drives and horrible things that happen, that we care. people mail me, your fleets keep me from alot of bad stuff. but u ll find me cursing for sure if i welp a fleet, **** being the least. if i aim that at a solo person however, in aim ti hurt him, that woudl suck. i like to think my comms are a reflection of rl, sometimes worse, and sometimes better, as much as eve is a sandbox so is comms, u can make of it as u please. so i hope if u ask my fleet membes, they ll say there is alot of respect for eachother, respect fir eahcother rl things, and at the same time we laugh our balls off, and i would use the word balls u re more then wlecome to listen in sometime :)"
1/1/2015,super fast probing is an indivisible part of the op bomber metathere needs to be a good way to interfere with on grid probing. ecm bursts? i don't even know. something.
1/1/2015,"given that scanning is currently so fast that ccp had to deliberately position probes at sun by default in order to keep the process from breaking the game, maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea to revisit that decision. maybe scanning for full precision would take a long time, but you could stop the process midway for good-enough results if you needed speed? i don't know, i'm just spitballing, but it would add a bit of depth to the minigame."

1/2/2015,"this reminds me of something from sins of a solar empire and therefore i love it.but first we, as players, would need actual small-scale deployable structures/guns/bombs/etc.the problem is, that i would assume, with so much cargo space to deploy these types of tactical structures one could just keep deploying, and keep deploying and keep deploying until the entire space is filled.for this concept, there has to be a form of limiting factor as well as range factor (minimum range between two deployables) or something on the lines of that to prevent just a mass swarm of turrets around a single location or a mass grouping of armor repairers making a single ship nigh-invulnerable.either way, trench warfare sounds like it fits into the universe pretty well and might provide smaller alliances/corps more options when wardec'd as well. sure would also make setting up proper cynos and covert cynos stressful in order to hit the key targets/locations."
1/2/2015,"in part i do not have a problem with the jump fatigue, on the other hand with it and the nerfing the carrier jump range it takes an entire day to move 30 jumps. honestly i have a carrier that i cant use anymore i trained up for it so i was usefull but now im not by haveing both it just seems over kill."
1/2/2015,"the only way highsec wardecs are broken right now is that they can be trivially dodged with 100% success rate. fix that, and we can talk about weakening them in any way. until then, since they are 100% voluntary thanks to the dec dodge exploit, you do not get to even hint about nerfing wardecs. a ""middle ground"" doesn't mean taking things away from one side. if you want a middle ground then it starts with giving up dec dodging. period."
1/2/2015,the issue would be easally solvable if the defending corp could bribe concord to end the war with say equal amount of isk to stop the war cold as the aggresor would pay to start it?
1/2/2015,"that is a way to opt out of the war and kinda breaks the purpose of them. plus, it is a blatant example of ""isk-tanking"" and would totally favour older, established players and render new players completely impotent. this suggestion is bad game design and won't be implemented. plus, if you think this will give you increased safety, you might be surprised to find out just how deep the pockets of your enemies actually are..."
1/2/2015,"here's an idea: take away all sov-related timers. allow systems to ping-pong back and forth (for a period of say, 7 days during ping-ponging the station becomes freeported). now you have 'occupancy' sov where the strongest group of people who live locally are going to be the ones that hold onto the system. huge blob just rolled through your constellation? no prob. they just left. undock and take the system back again, rendering the 'blob' irrelevant.there's a bunch of ways that ccp could do occupancy sov. i'm really keen on seeing what they present in two or three weeks time. but yeah, whatever they do, it has to render 'the blob', and in effect, coalitions, irrelevant."
1/2/2015,"you only need to do it once. you can continue to gank at -10 as proven by a lot of gankers. the only time you need to pay that is when you decide you want to reuse that character for something else, then it's just *click* consequences undone."
1/2/2015,"gully alex foyle : i wouldn<U+FFFD>t be against removing the faction police, so we would see more players with -5 or lower in high-sec. interaction between high-sec and any other part of eve can only be good. it also shows players from high-sec that there is more then just high-sec (where most start in). there are enough players in high-sec to still shoot them, so i don<U+FFFD>t really see the need for the police.making high-sec stations unaccessible is not something i would support right now, unless someone could convince me why it<U+FFFD>s really good idea. if negative status players could only base in low-sec, wouldn<U+FFFD>t that affect the high-sec players on the edge of high-sec more then the center ?"
1/2/2015,brain fart : what would happen if ccp reduced the jump fatigue if you're travelling in your own sov ?

1/2/2015,"true, but then you are also taking more risk. and wouldn't it make sense, that when you move in your own sov, it should be easier to move around, then when going to enemy sov ?"
1/2/2015,"the way ganking is right now they pretty much just need to see the fittings, calculate the number of catalysts they need and then warp to the target. code. has industrialized ganking. not sure but they may even use a spreadsheet for it!the only change i see that would make any real sense without killing ganking or making high sec a theme park would be to add a random element to concord response times. i am thinking a random number that either adds or subtracts from the response time. you could get a 5 second response in a .5 or maybe one that takes 45 seconds. you just won't know. you may even get enough time to kill multiple targets before they show up or loose all your ships with the target barely touched.it's become too push button and easy. they have the advantage since they know their target and exactly how many ships to bring. having something they can't plan for would balance things out a bit.sure they could just bring more ships but even that would make them work harder at it."
1/2/2015,"is your car faster and more maneuverable in your home town?i'm skeptical of the idea of eliminating faction police, for two reasons:1) it would not necessarily show people that there's more to the game than high sec, so much as it would change the nature of what high sec is. i don't necessarily think it would be a bad change, but it would probably not work the way anyone expects it to;2) if the npc factions can't even police their own space, what is the point in having them at all? eliminating them homogenizes high sec, eliminates terrain (even if it's relatively featureless terrain on a huge scale), and removed one extra bit of depth and complexity from the game.faction police are pretty useless anyway. i had another character's corp join factional warfare on the opposite side of the faction whose space they were in, and their destroyer--pve fit, not at all fitted or rigged for align time--undocked and made it back to friendly space with no extra effort on my part. the only thing faction police do is announce hollow threats at gates and keep hostiles from flying in anything approximately cruiser size or larger. getting around is easy."

1/2/2015,"manny,i've been impressed by your thread and responses so far...you are on my short list for csm definitely. one of the things that i like about your platform is to get into the nitty gritty of flying and balancing combat for not just big fleets but small gang / solo as well. few questions for you...1) i'm curious about your thoughts on the upcoming recon balance that ccp rise has put on the table for proteus. lot of debate back and forth on d-san immunity, t2 resists for recons, and frankly the role of the ships (i.e. stealthy recon vs electronic warfare platform...hard to do both). 2) what can we do to get battleships more interesting to fly? they are the face of pve but fall behind dramatically at pvp. as a side note it would be kinda nice to actually intentionally undock a raven for pvp instead of just shooting red crosses. 3) i noticed you specifically mentioned missiles as something that needed some work to make them more viable in pvp work. i tend to run missiles and drones pretty exclusively and you are spot on. what would you propose to ccp and the community to make the missile weapons family more competitive?4) how will you reach out to other facets of the community outside the big fleet scene? hopping in npsi roams, blogging, etc?thanks for your time - look forward to seeing your responses. cheers! biomassed - dust & eve podcast"
1/2/2015,simple question: why should voters choose you over your fellow alliance member and csm candidate manfred sideous?

1/4/2015,"this isn't going round-and-round - pretty much everyone here agrees you should be able to play the game as you like, but the point some are forgeting is that if you want the rewards of a significant industrial operation, you need to defend it. the core of what you ask is in the game already - the npc corp. it is the place you are suppose to fall back to if you lose everything or where you can start out. if you want a ""social corp"" that has the same restrictions but with a player created name and a corp channel, then you will find a lot of supporters for that including me.but pve and industrial players have to understand that the benefits they are extracting from the sandbox come at the cost that other players might object and try to stop them. there cannot be a way to opt out of wars for ""competitive"" corps or many things will break in the sandbox so do not expect to ccp to move much on that. sure, new/casual players should be able to dabble in pve and industry in relative safety less efficiently, but as soon as they are competing with the big boys, they need to be disruptable. and they also need to understand that players that do this aren't ""griefing"" in the eula breaking sense, but rather just applying competitive pressure on rival players in the sandbox we all live in. playing solo and/or with npc protection in highsec should never be the optimal or most efficient way to pursing isk-making activities, or what would be the point in players expending the effort and cost to secure their own space or organization? this is just basic game design of a sandbox game. if you just like playng casual then sure, be my guest and play as you like, but don't expect to make the same income as someone who is expending the effort to defend themselves or has made an arrangement with a pvp group to do that for them. besides, if you are just building things and never actually spending all the isk you are accumulating on combat, then what do you need the most efficient isk-making operation for anyway?"

1/4/2015,"not all corporations are created equal when new player experience is concerned. the kind of corporations often targeted by highsec pirates are barely, if at all, above npc corporations in their ability to serve new players. small highsec mining or mission running corporations should be left to those who are old and experienced enough to know what they are doing and should absolutely not be recommended as a starting point for new players. solo hs carebearing is all fine and good, but it it should be reserved for those who are truly dedicated to their carebearing ways. against popular opinion, it is not a suitable environment for fresh players and definitely not a good starting point for those still unsure of what kind of content they want from this game.i have seen a lot of people run a few missions or mine a few droids either solo or in a small highsec corp, and unsubmit out of boredom and due to a feeling of irrelevance. the players who i have seen become active content creators and active players have more often than not been those who have been engaged and pulled along for meaningful content by established null, low or wh based groups. everyone can use a low-sp scout or a hero tackler, so there is no reason not to take the newbie along for the ride.the finnish speaking player community has this excellent player retention system called suomi op, where players from established corporations run public pvp operations open for everyone who speaks the language. this has been a major contributing factor for player retention among those few newbies who are fortunate enough to find out about it. these operations have given new players a taste of the kind of game play they might otherwise not have encountered at all before unsubmitting, and have also helped give a lot of established carebears a taste of what making things explode feels like.the realization that the markets are full of replacement ships and that the ""scary"" parts of eve aren't actually that scary at all when you are no longer alone and miserable is an important experience for both the newbie and the veteran carebear. i strongly recommend player outreach programs such as this to everyone else as well, not least since they are an excellent excuse to get totally drunk with strangers on teamspeak. kudos to newbie-friendly veterans such as mauno materialisti, lacco, ugly eric, shana tirii and others for contributing to my retention trough suomi op when i was a clueless newbie."

1/4/2015,you have my vote :)please lets get the warp speed of battlecruisers back to before ccp have killed them since they were nerfed
1/4/2015,"that is a hell of a lot more work than our pray has to do. they ap trough highsec or sit afk in the belts. if they don't it gets a lot more complicated to kill them. so what you actually want is to complicate or increase the cost of an active play style to secure your afk play style which is already ridiculously secure even more. ganking can be countered easily by active players, like it should be in a sandbox. what you want is another buff to the automatic npc defense of your pilot-less and untanked ship.i would be interested what toras opinion is on the subject."
1/4/2015,"i understand eve is about feelings, but the csm shouldnt be. we are at war with the cfc for a year now, but i would still vote for one of them if i think they can do a good job. if you think i couldn't do that job, then you re right, don't vote for me.i agree on this, but i still want to add something for the active anti-ganking to be able to get a fight."

1/4/2015,you have my vote. i have a question though. do you have any ideas on how to improve the bounty system?
1/4/2015,"i think it broadly does the right thing at the moment, but that the 20% figure is too low. if attacking a bounty target awarded 35-40% of the net loss value, it would be more lucrative and might incentivise attacking people rather than just functioning as a tip to people that would have shot you anyway.initially the bounty system was set to pay 20% in order to address exploit concerns. these were justified - i personally reported two exploits at the time of the retribution launch (the big one, podding someone with a 'gold pod' installed, was hotfixed within hours by removing the gold pod implant from killmails).i believe changing it from 20% to 40% would not introduce new exploits but would make larger bounties more of a conflict driver. suddenly, it becomes *worth* your gank fleet targetting the code. battleship (with our alliance bounty) over the carebears inc battleship (with minimal/no bounty).secondly, i think the bounty system would be improved by reworking insurance. i should make a major post on this at some point, as my thoughts on insurance will probably be controversial (i believe insurance payments to high sp players should be sharply decreased, while keeping large payments to rookies, and have an only partly thought out idea for doing this). as insurance is such a large factor in the bounty payment formula, any nerf to insurance will improve bounty payouts.one final point. a common criticism of the bounty system is 'troll bounties' - i.e. bountying someone for a trivial amount for the lulz. i don't see these as an issue as bounties of under 50 million isk generally make no difference to pvp engagement decisions."
1/4/2015,"nice to see one of the last fun bastions in nullsec to be represented, provi has a place in my hart since i flew there for freelancing purposes, not to be an f1 monkey or obey blue donut agenda's made by people who don't even log in the game anymore.what is your view about the direction of the nullsec make up now that phoebe freeport republic is out there grabbing some sov ?"
1/4/2015,thanks first for the suppot. in regards to recons i see them serving 2 separate purposes. cloaking recons are well covert and by nature should be more focused on hit & run and things of that nature. whereas the combat recons would be amazing if they were beefier and able to be a part of main fleets on the front line applying superior ewar power. as it is they are super flimsy and you see people using t3's. if i were the one balancing them the lachesis would have low dps high tank/buffer potential. whereas the arazu would have higher dps and lower tank but they both would enjoy the same ewar bonus. as far as not showing up on the scanner i can see this being a decent bonus for the stealth recon.battleships are easy to tackle. you fix 3 things. one combat probing needs to be changed. two bombing needs to be changed. three missiles need to be immune to firewall but in exchange there needs to be counterplay to missiles. perhaps a midslot item that launches chaff that disrupts the accuracy of missiles.i plan to be very communicative once on the csm with post on the eve-forums and other fan sites. i've been known to participate in several podcast and radio shows as well as interviews this will continue to be true.
1/4/2015,"thanks for the response.i like your idea on the combat recon...survivability in stead of pure dps and they can preform admirably. i'm admittedly a bit concerned my rook will still be overshadowed by he t1 blackbird, falcon, and t3s. at this point, just about anything that can help missile systems will be welcome and you idea of counters to them could be pretty niftyagain, thanks for answering and good luck in the election. biomassed - dust & eve podcast"

1/4/2015,"in every pvp game i've played, all those years, there has always been a hunter killer able to go after cloaked characters (and sometimes dedicated mostly to that).why not make the force recon (the recon without cloak, supposed to be the ultimate ewar platform) able to scan down and hunt cloaked ships: if the cloaked pilot is active, he can see the recon coming to him and warp to another bookmark, but if he is afk, he's dead meat.when close enough, the force recon can target (which breaks the cloak)... and the rest is history :)"

1/5/2015,"it's funny how you mention tears, as it's emotive and you use it in an attempt to bolster your claims. the trouble is you're on weak ground in that regard. the tears only come after extremely poor reactions from your side. this can include foul language, talk of things about ones mother, sexuality, race, wishing all ones family cancer, death threats and a generally bad attitude towards others gaming style.now there are many who actually are playing a game and talk to us. they ask for advice and understand the game they are playing. there has even been occasions i have given isk to pilots i have just blown up. mostly due to their attitude and giving them a leg up.so i find your attempt at playing the tear card, rather a hollow one. it's not about the tears. players only use that to wind up poor players of the game. the ones with no qualms about offering up death threats, or turning a blind eye to them when others do.and once again. there are no pve only pilots. i know you don't like to hear it, but it's fact. all your so called 8 year pve veterans, are 8 year pvp ones. pvp includes, but is not limited to ship combat. it also involves industry, mining, missions etc etc.eve is pvp centric, it revolves around conflict/competition. if you really do not want that, then play on the test server. you'll find the perfect place for your needs. no player conflict/competition. find a little system somewhere and mine, build, mission to your hearts content.of course you won't. why? well it'll be boring as hell because there will be no player conflict/competition. funny that.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."

1/5/2015,"i am going to clarify some things in hopes to avoid distractions.advocating for csm reform is in the context of my platform apolitical. you don't need to be a veteran eve player to understand that my allegiances are to my own values. my corp history is indicative of that. when i say that i want to ""change"" policy i am refering specifically too the csm whitepaper.as referenced before the csm is not at any point during campaigning required to tell the truth. they are also not prohibited from ""buying"" votes. the extreme of this being spending real life money to buy eve accounts ahead of the deadline for the sole purpose of padding the voting process. it's very easy for opponents of my platform to ask ""how would you solve it"".what i think they don't understand is that the csm is not 1 person with absolute authority making decisions on what to do about the game. the csm is a group of people consulting with ccp and advocating collectively for changes and ideas they feel are important. asking me in any specificity how i would ""fix"" or ""solve"" a problem assumes that any 1 person can walk into the room, press the right button and all will be well. my platform is incongruous with any mentality that a single person should without oversight be able to make a judgment call and subsequently execute the consequences of that judgment. the flaws in the current voting system not only allow for such outcomes but incentives them."

1/5/2015,"i will chip in and say that core is rather charismatic on comms. it is where he shines. maybe it was raising kids that gave him the right attitude. we had an easy to happen but big mess up recently. a wing commander wanted to right click through something and warped his wing off from a fight. suddenly, we went from holding to losing and everyone that could had to just bail out.core didn't freak out. he didn't yell abuse. he just absorbed it, voiced some exasperation, disappointment and then commiserated with how bad the guy must be feeling about what happened.@core: did you give the mach pilot something? he was doing just fine until all this happened, no pilot error on his behalf.another example, is where we flew head long as a worm hole alliance, core saw a black ops ship on his overview and asked the guy if he was seriously going to bring that. the guys said he wasn't and was just messing about. next thing, there he is in a full on fight and lost it, logi remarked how it folded so incredibly fast.response? words to the effect of, ""that is why you don't bring black ops into a full on fight"" bit of light chastisement to show it had been noticed.core is good, well balanced. if you want a fc that really knows how to stay frosty, have a look for jin'taan. he sounds like he plays the game while getting a massage, in a hot bath with candle light and incense after meditating to find his inner serentiy."
1/5/2015,"+1, we need to keep you!"
1/5/2015,sugar kyle has definitely earned a repeat spot on my csm ballot for this year.
1/5/2015,"with the starting of the new year, i am proud to announce my candidacy for csmx.my name is jayne fillon, and i've been playing this wonderful game without pause since early 2012. like many, the sandbox nature of eve was overwhelming to me at first, and i struggled to find my place in new eden. after a very brief stint in highsec running missions, i joined a small pvp corp in syndicate, only to be robbed soon after joining. from there, i tried to start my own wormhole corp, which failed early on. finally, i moved onto lowsec where i tried, unsuccessfully, to become a mercenary.at this point i was on the verge of quitting the game, and would have, had i not found the npsi community.my love for the npsi community started over two years ago - eight months after i started playing - and i have not looked back since. my experience flying npsi helped me learn how to pvp and eventually led me to become a fleet commander. before i knew it, i was the ceo of a successful pvp corporation - and from there, i founded a completely new npsi channel called <U+FFFD>spectre fleet,<U+FFFD> where i spend most of my time.my eve story is far from unique - i've heard countless stories just like it.unfortunately, unlike mine, these stories often end with <U+FFFD>i was on the verge of quitting the game, and then i did.<U+FFFD>out of all the the things npsi showed me, the most important was the need to be engaged in what you do. playing this game alone is not enough, you have to be an active participant within the community to truly experience eve. the community as a whole is what makes this game fun, it<U+FFFD>s why we stay. the community is the sole reason why we still log in despite no shortage of other games to entertain us. despite all this, the tools players have to facilitate forming groups and playing together are severely lacking.thankfully, ccp is aware of these complaints and are actively taking steps to address the current issues.last year, during the fanfest keynote speech, ccp seagull outlined eve online<U+FFFD>s development roadmap. there were two main focuses during 2014: industry (released with crius), as well as a redesign of corporations and alliances. the latter topic was discussed during the summer summit with csm9, and the details were published in the meeting minutes later that year. the twelve page section covering team five-o<U+FFFD>s meeting with csm9 placed the scale and difficulty of this project into perspective:<U+FFFD>fozzie explained that ccp had their external testing partner come in and map out corporations and alliances. the information was so thick and obscure that there were things no one knew about. [...] the partner company has produced a one hundred and five page document [...] that explains the current corporation and alliance system and how it relates to the rest of eve.<U+FFFD>unsurprisingly, during the eve vegas keynote speech in october, a new development roadmap was released, listing the redesign of corporations as an ongoing project. this means that whether you like it or not, redesigning corporations has become a priority for ccp, and will be the precursor to both sovereignty warfare and starbase management. this is an important project. this project will lay the foundation of future releases and development, and it goes beyond just corporations and alliances...whether it<U+FFFD>s been called <U+FFFD>corp lite<U+FFFD> by csm9 funkybacon or <U+FFFD>social groups<U+FFFD> by csm9 mangala solaris , there is a need for something more than what the traditional corporation structure can provide. there are a myriad of groups operating all over new eden who operate outside of the current corporation and alliance mechanics: nullsec sigs, highsec incursion groups, roleplayers and lore aficionados, gankers and anti-gankers, podcasters, traders, bloggers, and of course the npsi communities themselves.none of these groups operate in game with anything other than a chat channel and a mailing list.there is literally nothing else in game for these groups to use, and this needs to change.the list of things that could (and should) be either tweaked or completely redesigned is rather substantial, but i'm confident that with my experience both as a corporate ceo and leader of the largest channel based community in the game, i can help ccp make the right decisions. if you are a part of any of the communities i listed above you should know that your most vocal advocate on the current csm, mangala solaris, has elected not to run for another term. let me be your voice in his stead, and help ccp create an eve that promotes and encourages social interaction, building a stronger eve community. cheers,jayne"

1/5/2015,"this is the perfect year to have you on csm. you'll be prominently placed on my ballot.am i correct in assuming that you'd like non-alliance communities to be able to have their own logos, at least if they're large enough? do you think players should be able to submit their own designs, or assemble them from provided bits as is done with the (admittedly dated and archaic) corp logo system? maybe both?"
1/5/2015,"in regards to the faster release cadence, i've been extremely impressed with the rate at which ccp has been churning out new features - and good features at that. i feel that the flexibility of this system compared to the older 6 month release cycle has given the developers the freedom to be more brazen with their changes, knowing that they can tweak them if they don't bring the desired (or at least, beneficial) results - see the removal of industrial teams for an example. i think that ccp's old rigid release cycle hindered development, and if they need to ""stray"" from the current release cycle (a week forward here, a week delay there, etc) then this system gives them the flexibility they need to make it happen, and they absolutely should.modules tiericide is awesome for everyone - except probably entity, who i assume is crying into pools of isk now that all his defunct and unique items are either being rebranded or removed. oh well, can't make everyone happy, and the changes are certainly for the best. as for recons, specifically the dscan change, this one plays on my heart strings for the simple reason that dscan immunity falls under a category of game design called an ""incomparable"". with a bit of nifty math, you can quite easily determine which ships have the most dps, or the most tank, the most maneuverability, etc. however, there is no way you can equate ""dscan immunity"" to having 100 more dps or something else equally quantitative. hopefully i haven't lost you.what this essentially means is that there is no way to empirically determine if this feature will make recons overpowered or underpowered compared to other ship classes, as their attributes are ""incomparable."" this is good game design, as it forces players to move away from minmaxing and towards to use of tactics to best one another in combat. i'll indulge myself and take this one step further: this leads to a state of play referred to as ""cyclic"" imbalance. the recon upon first release will be widely considered as powerful (if not overpowered), until suitable tactics are created to counter them, at which point those mechanics will come under scrutiny. now you need ongrid scouting of enemy fleets, etc etc.that being said, i can see dscan immunity wreaking havoc in faction warfare. i'm sure ccp isn't oblivious to these dangers, but their effects in lowsec warfare will have to be closely monitored to ensure it doesn't lead to less fights, and an even more risk averse playstyle. that would - i assume - be the opposite of what is intended.fake edit: i reread the post, ccp rise had already commented of the dangers of dscan immune recons in fw."
1/5/2015,"ah! so, we only have to choose between you two then?"
1/5/2015,"oh christ that list is massive.... you're asking about specifically npsi fleets?1) fleet standings, either manually set or inherit from fc.2) more options in fleet adverts, saved presets, etc.3) more granular fleet, channel, and mailing list roles.it pains me to just pick three, but there you go. for more, you should check out the discussion here or again watch my presentation from eve vegas, where i talk about this near the end. the link is in the op."
1/5/2015,"ganking in highsec is in a good place overall, imho. i've both ganked, and been ganked multiple times. every time i've been ganked i've either been afk, or taken too large of a risk. everytime i gank, i'm impressed with the amount of organization required to pull it off successfully; if you want to make a profit from ganking, the complexity of an operation increases even further.that being said, highsec as a whole is not in a good place overall.the reason for this was summarized beautifully by sion kumitomo in the csm9 summer summit minutes: .... which is wrong on so many levels it's unbelievable. why are there no incursion corporations or alliances? what about mission running, or mining corporations? why does highsec not have the same storied history that inspires historians to write books?i speak to these issues in particular because you left your question open ended and i know you are personally invested in the wardec mechanics, which i believe is in dire need of an overhaul and has been in need of one for a long time. i'll leave it at that for now, but if you want a more detailed response please be more specific. i'll be happy to answer."
1/5/2015,"i would support anything that helps give these groups of players a sense of belonging, such as a collective symbol or identity to rally around. think of how important the bee has become in goon culture, or the phage or pandemic legion, or even middle management dino from test.it doesn't overly matter to me what medium is used to create these, as both player created or provided tools would work, but there has to be something. even simple cosmetic items such as logos or tickers often hold a lot of meaning for players. this has become an issue with new alliance logos being delayed indefinitely, which is something that hopefully gets resolved soon."

1/5/2015,i guess i am technically part of the multiboxer community as you so eloquently describe and i definitely do not feel misrepresented at all. in fact i feel happy with the jan 1st changes and if anything am more content with ccps current approach and general attitude to the changed tos and eula than previously.not wanting to rain on your parade or anything...though have to say good on you for finding a usp to separate yourself from the crowd of csm hopefuls.
1/5/2015,"i am glad you are happy for the changes. i agree it pulls more out of the grey area than was previously, but it also caused alot of issues and generated more questions that simply need answered. check out my podcast! my blog!"
1/5/2015,"well if your interests in bringing 3rd party multiboxing issues to ccp is to further reduce the area of grey that lies between what's for and against the tos and eula for the purposes of closing any loopholes that may potentially exist then i could support that. but if you're gunning for finding loopholes to exploit, then that's more than objectionable in my eyes.however such a venture would not be outside the spirit of previous ventures by many eve players, some might say it can be said to somewhat define an eve online player from other mmo's or multiplayer games."
1/5/2015,"suzy just so you know, i grabbed the above post."
1/5/2015,"i'm going to keep this short and simple: i have been living in low class wormholes for several years and have lived through many changes, some good, some not so good. i've also lived in lowsec for the same amount of years (i have 7 accounts, 10 toons not counting cyno alts) . i feel i can represent very well the interests of the everyman in new eden, bringing to the center stage those issues and concerns we live with on a daily basis. as a professional in real life, i understand commitment and communication, and if elected to the csm, you will get both from me.vote starbuck for csm in 2015!"
1/5/2015,+1 am inspired.
1/5/2015,good dude +1
1/5/2015,"profile not smug enough, no dramallama in thread, lack of dragons.-1"
1/5/2015,why should i vote for you vs. for jayne?
1/5/2015,thanks for your question: you should vote for us both; we represent different interest groups.
1/5/2015,"can you please explain in more detail? i know what interest groups jayne represents, but i have a much less clear view how your perspective is different from jayne's."
1/5/2015,"thanks, june. to be clear, jayne's and my campaign are not at all related. it's true we fly together and i do fly and fc npsi from time to time, but while jayne is running to represent the npsi community, i'm running to represent the small-time operator as i indicated in my candidacy post. to wit:as you well know thanks to your altruistic efforts in helping players, eve is a confusing place, but not just for new players. players who have been around for a while and generally know what they want to do in new eden are still blocked in many ways from having a say or in being represented during the continuous development of the game.obviously in our world we know that the squeaky wheel gets the grease, so to speak, and so the major powers, who have needs specific to their larger numbers, are usually heard. even the moderately sized groups have committed representation. but what about the committed player who, for example, lives in a low class wormhole? forums are a great tool, and so is having a csm representative who can voice their perspective and regurgitate development back to that community. it's not an easy task because these folks tend to be somewhat nomadic or keep to themselves, and so a new effort in including them and communicating their interests would be a welcome relief.i believe that at its core, the csm is a liaison force who, with as much effort as they put in to influencing development of eve, have the responsibility to communicate to and for the citizens of new eden. we have csm representatives today like sugar kyle who do this well, and i, too, would endeavor to be such."
1/5/2015,i'd be interested in hearing the good and bad changes and what you think needs improving in w space both highera nd lower classes.

1/5/2015,
1/6/2015,"there is something i've never quite understood about that. ccp promised a lot of cool features with walking in stations. they showed teasers of some different rooms and areas that looked really great, then they didn't deliver. people got upset because they didn't deliver. ccp then decided that meant that we didn't want wis. wtf? how? why? someone sucked on the bong one too many times? no. (well, maybe, tbh.)it was probably because a vocal minority played both sides, but i still don't see how ccp could screw up so badly. players rioted over the new eden store and the failure of ccp to deliver on wis. how can that possibly be interpreted as the players not wanting ccp to deliver at all?do not run. we are your friends."
1/6/2015,as mentioned in the other thread. i'd rather see this as an industrial ship (t2) bridging the gap between industrial and combat ships since it can field offensive power.
1/6/2015,"read the other thread, all i can say is that this would likely be a godsend for nullsec and wormhole corps who set up and tear down a lot of poses. in regards to the proposed bonuses posted in the same thread - i could see some interesting usage of the light engineer and heavy engineers to severely cut down on the time required to anchor and online a pos.additional thoughts:the heavy engineers should be relatively speedy, as most pos setups have a lot of offensive modules scattered ~35km from both the tower and each other. slowboating around to scoop them is a tedious process.the heavy engineer would also benefit from an ice products hold large enough to hold 1d17h of pos fuel. not a cargo hold, as that's a lot of space that would result in the ship being used as a fleet resupply tender.the heavy engineer's orbital infrastructure hold is a good idea, but if you want to make it possible to scoop modules to it then there would need to be a bit of work done on fleet hangars/other specialized holds to make it possible to scoop pos modules to specialized holds."
1/6/2015,"i like the changes as they are. it means that, instead of being able to throw huge fleets and/or capitals at every problem that shows up, deployments need to be thought out strategically. yes, it's harder to move around, but that means you're more likely to find similar-sized fleets to fight without risking capital escalation by engaging."
1/6/2015,"that was exactly the whole point of the change: to make being 30 jumps away from somewhere actually mean something. your carrier is still extremely useful; it's just not usable to help dunk on someone 3 regions away and get you home for tea with no consequences any more.since you're in test, fights are coming to you pretty much daily in any case.edit: incidentally, you can use gates now; it should take you no more than a couple of hours to go 30 jumps in a carrier - if you want to trade jump fatigue for risk."
1/6/2015,"lets see how we can solv the 3 day thing really fast shall we? you are in test, which has sov. your leaders need to add the wormhole upgrades in there ihubs and you scan your area. i'll bet you right now you have a wh in one of your systems that you can take that will most likely move you to an area you want to go, or at the very least reduce your jump range. you also have gates, as in you jump someplace, wait till cyno ends, have your cyno pilot scout the way, and you move via gates to get a tad closer to your next jump and maybe jump father. no fatigue and fewer cynos. the carrier is efficient, as said above you can get there faster with higher risk, or get there slower with less risk."
1/6/2015,"hello council,i am not sure if this is possible or even practical, but what about implementing a loan contract into game. for example, you create a contract like a courier contract, that secures a loan as well as interest. allows younger budding traders the option to trade with more capital. also allows for rich veterans to safely invest in other ventures. i know the implementation of this would be hard because there is no way to secure future isk. it would be cool if it worked as if the loan contract failed, all the money would be returned minus some that is lost. the other player would either go in the negative or have its assets wiped. to keep this as scam free as possible. maybe make the loan contract create a new wallet division, like a corp wallet. where the money can not be transfered between characters in order to keep track of it. and the investor can see and track the progress. anyways just me writing down my ideas. would love to see something like this in the future.cheers,sal goodman9"
1/6/2015,"used to exist in eve but were removed because they were rarely used (because you could just as easily sell the items/stuff you were using as collateral for isk).as for the rest of the idea... it would be abused. easily.- you can have throwaway alt characters (either on the same account, an alt account, or a friend's account) take out massive loans, buy a whole bunch of assets, and then leave those assets in space for retrieval (which effectively ""ends"" any paper trail as ""transferring"" assets in space is mechanically no different than ""stealing"").- you can build massive ponzi schemes with multiple alts (loan alt a, which loan to alt b, which loans to alt c, which loans back to alt a and b, which can then loan back to alts a, b, and c, etc) to completely fubar any paper trail and get massive amounts of money."
1/6/2015,"dscan's strength comes from (surprisingly enough) it's directional ability. sure, it can be used to just see what else is in the system, but by using its directional ability you can pinpoint where something is if you know what you're doing. if we automate that ability, the game would be waaaaaaaaaaay too easy."
1/6/2015,"in order for a sabre to achieve a 2-second warp, they need to fit their ship out for align and warp speed, combined with some expensive implants. this severely limits their combat capabilities. a retriever, fit out similarly, can achieve a 7-second warp. across a 16 au system, if both pilots are reacting at the same time, the sabre will never be able to catch the retriever because, at the absolute best it can achieve for warp speed, it will still take about four seconds to warp. the retriever would have to be sitting at the belt warp-in point for the sabre to catch them. if the retriever were sitting opposite the warp-in point, across the belt, there would be a 4-5 second burn for the sabre to get into longpoint distance, or about 2-4 seconds (depending on prop mod) with an overheated point.the retriever would be in-warp to a safe before the sabre could catch a point.of course, if the retriever pilot were being diligent, the sabre would never even see them on grid, unless there are a very tiny number of belts, as the sabre pilot would first need to locate the retriever.this would be so game-breaking that i can't even comprehend it being suggested. it would take me less than ten minutes to write a script that monitored a section of a window that would plate a chime alerting me when something changed on it. automatic dscan would pick up a ship, this script would chime, and a person would be alerted to the change.this script would be impossible for ccp to detect unless they were scanning my computer as a whole, which if they're doing that, i'll have a whole host of other issues with them.csm candidates should not need to be linked to these:"
1/6/2015,"(double-posting because of the five-quote limit. sorry.)frig holes came out with the hyperion release, four months ago:"
1/6/2015,"eve is a game of shills, and this is one of the first things you must learn to really get into the meat of it. if you haven't come to terms with this yet, chances are you are not enjoying eve nearly as much as you could be. reminds me of an argument i had with my brother, who is more of a genius than i am and understands people better than i do, but he was yet unable to fathom how players can enjoy playing eve. he reasoned that one player's enjoyment came at the cost of someone else's displeasure. i could not come up with a suitable answer then, but now i have given it a lot more thought and i realize that the reason so many of us can enjoy playing eve is because we can have fun not only winning against ships, but also in losing ships. or at least, we have to enjoy the negative parts of eve that come with the positive. we enjoy eve not only for those sweet moments of triumph, but for the gritty underlying darkness of the game in general.people who don't enjoy the darker parts of their experience in some way will probably eventually quit no matter what we do to save them. it's just not their game."
1/6/2015,"you are assuming the sabre is working solo.new worm holes can pop up all the time.d-scan. you clearly haven't heard of clicking programs / devicies that can click a specific spot really rapidly at intervals and return your mouse to the previous position.i can talk about the anti-afk cloak ideas that i support.suicide ganking - again you assume that i have never taken revenge on someone in the past.and again you seem to think it is a solo activity.you also assume people will only do it for profit.yes, i want to see the voting break down also. high sec gives up the same way that spectre fleets are so small and disorganised.it takes some experience and a minute of common sense to realise how bad frigate holes are, as i said they strip away control of access.sorry to hear about your unemployment, it is a horrid over capitalistic society we are in these days with a continuing slinky recession.i don't put on a fake smile and slap people that i don't like on the back. i will lose with my principles intact and speaking my mind without self censoring and conforming.i was described once as a ""rugged individualist"" c'est la vie. *shrugs*fixed quoting. isd ezwal."
1/6/2015,"tell him it is schadenfreude all my pvpships i try and make them the first time before i fly them. in the case of scimitars recenly, i got the bpc and the bits then someone with the skills assembled it for me.puts more value on the ship and the gamble of losing it is higher. gives that little kick in eve that other mmos are missing."
1/6/2015,your ideas are bad and your understanding flawed. i will most certainly not be voting for you. in fact if there were a way to vote against you i would.
1/6/2015,do you have any figures on wh population and if its going up or down to back up this claim. with the increase in blue loot they actually seem more active now than before. hinting that wh population is increasing.
1/6/2015,"20 seconds to align? that's the base align of a covetor-hull mining ship with a pilot mining solo with no navigation skills. is that normal in null sec? i guess that's a choice, but i'd think anyone mining in dangerous space would train up the relevant skills, at least have an alt cloaked up in space in order to get leadership bonuses, including for agility, and fit for a quicker align time. oh, and fit a higgs anchor rig in order to make mining while aligned more effective. the align time sucks when you have to change celestials, but when you're aligned, you can definitely warp off before that sabre can lock you."
1/6/2015,you got my vote
1/6/2015,"this looks like a no win situation. if you get elected it proves the system does work (contrary to your premise) and so the reform would not be needed. if you are not elected then your premise may or may not be a fault but you will be unable to do anything about it.we have made the white paper a living document to allow for changes to be made, year by year as the csm grows/changes/evolves so if elected you are welcome to try for election reform but as you said, above, you cannot walk in and push a button, you will need the cooperation of other members of the csm and of ccp to effect any long lasting changes.politicians can lie? well, yes they can and probably do. me, i like twains thoughts on truth"
1/6/2015,"it's a slim chance, but there are times in a rigged supposedly-representative system in which the majority may briefly come to agree on a point of contention and use the broken voting system for an act of upheaval.while i disagree with xenuria on there being said problem in place, i believe she has the right to fight behind such a reform movement. i see no harm coming from it, as even in the case that it is successful, it is most likely only representative of a deeper dissatisfaction in the voters over how the system works. even if these voters are misguided as to the specifics of what is wrong with the system, they still help to reveal the discontent."
1/6/2015,"just face it dude, no one wants you, or your ignorance or banter, on the csm. want to find all the podcasts around eve online visit"
1/6/2015,do you have anything constructive to add to the discussion?
1/6/2015,"hi tisiphone, thank you for taking time to comment in my thread. as i said in my opening post, the holiday season is always hectic, but i have been keeping up with my thread.thank you for the invitation:"
1/6/2015,you have my vote.i don't fly much in wh or anything like that but i know you have worked hard for the wh community and for the community as a whole and i respect that. yesterday's weirdness is tomorrow's reason why. hunter s. thompson
1/6/2015,+1easily top 3 of the csm if not number 1
1/6/2015,+1keep mike on the job improving the game.
1/6/2015,i will be voting for you. i have seen the work you have put in heard other csm members talk about your hard work. i like that and i believe you will continue to work hard for us.yesterday's weirdness is tomorrow's reason why. hunter s. thompson
1/6/2015,"i'm glad to see you're running again. i've been impressed with the work you've been doing so far, especially the communication with the community at large.you absolutely have my vote."
1/6/2015,csmx interview
1/6/2015,what is you opinion about ccp giving you less then 24 hours as a csm member to respond on big game changing matters like losec doomsdayssource:
1/6/2015,"i do not like it. i acknowledge when communication lapses like this happen. i then do my best to deal with the situation. to quote myself from my weekly csm9 update on october 5th, 2014:ideally, i<U+FFFD>d like some time to think. i may have an immediate reaction but some things crop up after pondering the topic. with something like doomsdays it is hard to gather player reaction and feedback before it becomes public. for this particular topic, i needed to sit down with experienced pilots who know the mechanics of doomsdays and ideally, people who were around when doomsdays could be used before. that made the 24 hour notice for this mechanic useful. i was able to go to the public and ask for feedback and work on it. at the end of the day, i<U+FFFD>d prefer to have more advanced warning, always."
1/6/2015,"you have my retweet.seriously, good luck, you'll be on my ballot."
1/6/2015,"are you going to betray all of us like you did to doom?also, from reading your op, it sounds like your main focus on csm is to add in-game mechanics that enable more npsi content. why take something which main selling is ""you don't have to leave your corp or join ours to roam"" and then add in all this functionality that basically makes it another corp?during the time i worked with you your leadership decisions were questionable, you have a long line of people who have worked with you in the past claiming you've shorted them and/or straight up betrayed them, and from my point of view your fc/leadership decisions have been driven by passion and rash impulse rather than spending a lot of time and thought on them. will we see this behavior reflect during your presumed term on the csm?do we really need more official subgroups in eve apart from corp/alliance/militia? a few years ago there was a short clamour for implementation for a 'coalition' mechanic in eve; doesn't this mentality just encourage redundant feature creep? for npsi fleets, do we really need anything more than another fleet finder filter called ""public?"" because what are corps/sigs/whatevers apart from a shared chat channel and mailing list?this past csm we've seen chairs filled by members who contributed nothing to the pressing matters at hand and served to promote their own interests; which is technically all the csm is, if ccp isn't going to pay attention to what you have to say because they don't deem it a pressing matter (they won't), then why waste a chair seat on it?ccp has given you the tools you need and told you how to use them; chat channels and mailing lists. we don't a csm member just to tell ccp that we should have a spectre fleet logo on killmails.there's no use crying after every mistake, you just keep on trying 'til you run out of cake."
1/6/2015,"assuming that was a serious question, no. in game politics and personas have no place on csm - a la gorski car acting like an idiot or mynnna acting only in the interest of the cfc, instead of serving the playerbase as a whole.edit: you edited your post while i was mid-response, i'll answer the new stuff that you added in a separate response."
1/6/2015,"good question. first, the mechanics that i referred to are not limited to npsi communities, but would be useful to a large number of groups from all over new eden. for example, the mechanics that are being discussed regarding fleet adverts would certainly help the npsi communities, but would also help anyone who interacted with the fleet mechanic - that is, the majority of eve.i'm normally a very analytical person, and when i don't know something or when i realize i've made an error, i'm usually the first to admit to it. as for my leadership style and the betrayal of people i've worked with in the past, that's a different story entirely. in my experience it's often the people who feel they are owed something, such as the loyalty of others, who feel the most betrayed when something goes wrong. for example, as a ceo of a corporation i feel responsible to my people first and foremost, and when they stop enjoying the game (for whatever reason) it is my job to rectify that as soon as possible, and in whatever way possible. structures, friendships, legacies... they can all be rebuilt - but we play this game first and foremost to have fun.... and if we're not having fun, why are we playing?even a ""public"" fleet finder would be a useful, and simple, addition to current mechanics and yet it has still not been implemented. as for the coalition mechanics and feature creep, these ""entities"" already exist in game, just not in an official capacity. coalitions will exist regardless of a mechanic officially supporting it, as with the communities that currently exist exist regardless of the amount of tools ccp has made available. viewing it strictly from the ""quality of life"" perspective, if the vast majority of the playerbase is already playing the game in this manner, why would ccp not add the functionality? with these sorts of tools you would not only make the existing groups stronger, but promote new and more diverse groups in the future.what are corps other than shared chat channels and mailing lists? shared standings, calendars, fleet adverts, contracts, roles, kill logs, history, titles..... the list is endless. corporations also allow for the ownership of structures and declarations of war - features which should not be granted to a ""corp lite"" model. this is where the distinction is made - eve doesn't even have a friends list, and yet is billed as a social and community based game. want to be friends with someone in game who isn't in your corporation? interact with them? good luck. anyone who has participated in a non corporation based group is well aware of just what is missing, and what minor changes could drastically increase a member's quality of life.this is where i get to empirically say that you're wrong. this is a priority for ccp whether you like it or not. this was made clear in both the fanfest keynote speech as well as the update to the development roadmap during the eve vegas keynote speech. the details are in the op if you're interested. that being said, i'm well aware that there will be more involved with the csm than solely this topic, this is simply the facet a ccp's roadmap where i consider myself a subject matter expert.this is no different than steve being an sme in 3rd party development, manny a sme in sovereignty warfare, mike azariah a sme for highsec or corebloodbrothers is a sme on the nrds playstyle. even when those topics are not at hand, those individuals can and still do contribute to the discussion - as will i. my knowledge and experiences in eve are certainly focused in this area of the game, but certainly not limited by them."
1/6/2015,"except you have not yet referred to any mechanics specifically, apart from that there is a substantial list of them; in fact the only solid mechanic you have named that you would support is one that i brought up. what other mechanics do you propose that would help these informal organizations feel more cohesive? additionally, of the ones you named (nullsec sigs, highsec incursion groups, roleplayers and lore aficionados, gankers and anti-gankers, podcasters, traders, bloggers, and npsi communities) i can only see three, perhaps four that would get any use out of these yet unnamed mechanics you propose, and only maybe 1 (your npsi) can make a passable argument for spending any sort of development time into improving.so tl;dr, how would these corporation-interface-style mechanics help bloggers? roleplayers? podcasters? what precisely would you propose we add? ccp's financial reports have looked grim recently, though the new trailer and expansions have added a wealth of new players and subs do you think ccp is going to invest the developer time and money into making these ideas into reality, when it's not something that is very marketable to new subscribers or returning players?if elected, you will owe your constituents the full devotion of the time you can afford to commit to the game towards forwarding the platform you ran on. even if other csm members disagree with you or ccp says ""no"" to something you can't just pout out and quit on the people that elected you. being on the csm is probably not going to be very 'fun,' it entails playing nicely with other people you might not like or agree with. as far as whether or not you can do this, all we have to go on is your track record in game, which is not stellar.much like coalitions, these groups like npsi fleets and sigs already exist and are strong in the game as-is. they certainly don't need mechanics to exist or be popular, as we can see from various ganked/spectre/bombers bar fleets. what i want to know is, what exactly do you propose should be added, why is it necessary, and is it feasible for ccp to invest into making it happen when they are already faced with the issues of making real corporations and alliances work; none of which you have given a tangible answer to.there's no use crying after every mistake, you just keep on trying 'til you run out of cake."
1/6/2015,"-npsi groups have no need of standings. if you want to share a standings list, chat channel, and mailing list with somebody and you're in an npc corp, ccp has already given you the tools for this: it's called joining a corp.----incidentally, ccp has state"
1/6/2015,"the references to find this information was located in the op, but i'll recreate it here: group calendars group fitting list group bulletins group contracts group logo fleet to fleet standings fleet standings fleet kill history fleet adverts disconnecting while in fleet active members list official channel listing channel history channel roles and modes mailing list roles mailing list population cap mailing list links as you said, not all of these will benefit communities or social groups that do not work around the fleet mechanic. even so, the amount of people who fleeting up with one another outside the boundaries of the corporation mechanic is astonishing, and more than most people realize. in spectre fleet alone there are 4000 people registered on the mailing list, the maximum allowed. last saturday, during our ""golden fleet"" event with rvb ganked over 700 people joined our npsi fleet. we are but one of five major npsi communities in eve, not to mention the major russian and german npsi communities.what about incursion channels? the valhalla project, the ditanian fleet, warp to me, and incursion shiny network all run on the same principals of our pvp npsi communities for their pve npsi content in highsec. they do this because the corporation mechanic is not only useless to them but detracts from their desired way to play the game. these organizations are more active, more capable, more social, than a lot of organization that use the corporate mechanics. do these people not deserve a voice? you're simply insane if you think that these entities are undeserving of ""any development time.""moving onto non-fleet based communities and how their qol could be improved. streaming communities such as sirsqueebles and eve-radio currently have nothing but links to oog browsers and websites in order to deliver their content or host their communities. twitch broadcast integration already exists, why not watch eve streamers in client? why not be able to listen to eve-radio in game? lore aficionados have their arek'jaalan mailing list, and would benefit from these changes, as well as being able to collaborate on deciphering the mysteries of in game events such as caroline's star.oh, and how would anti-gankers benefit from these changes? this is my favorite one to answer.this blog post from minerbumping.com describes the hostile takeover of the ""anti-ganking"" channel. for those who aren't experienced with running a group that bases out of a channel, you might be surprised that the only role you can give someone is ""operator,"" which is equivalent to a full director. any operator has the exact same roles as the channel founder, there is no other option. unfortunately for the owners of anti-ganking, an operator went rogue and completely nuked the channel. if you want to know the full story, read the blog post.to put this in perspective, as the ceo or a corporation, you would have to give a member full director roles even if you wanted the only to do something trivial like send a mail or make a bookmark. tell me that isn't completely insane. a few bad apples in every bundle. just because you don't like me, doesn't mean that i'm incapable of forming friendships or profession working relationship with other people. as a leader it's impossible to make everyone happy, and you'll always get along with some better than others. this is true whether spoken in the context of a corporation, a community, or a council.dotlan is a popular and powerful tool that already exists. should this stop ccp from updating the ingame map? no, don't be ridiculous. same goes for literally any other third party tool: fleet-up, carebearium, siggy, pyfa, plh, etc etc. i'd like to make it clear that my ideas and proposals are not separate from a corporation and alliance redesign, but a part of it. however, it's my belief that even rework the corporation mechanics from the ground up will fail to include all of the needs and wants of the playerbase, to facilitate how they play the game. i am equally excited to contribute to corporation reform, and whatever else that leads to."
1/6/2015,"speak for yourself.i get it, you don't play npsi, and you never have. you aren't involved in any of these communities, and as such the eve you play is vastly different from the one that myself and thousands of others play. i'm not going to be pedantic regarding each and every point that you feel like we can do ""fine enough without.""regarding third party tools, we'll simply have to agree to disagree..... and i agree with this direction. npsi communities already serve as the catalyst that many people need to convert from pve to pvp. we draw from all over eve: established pirate corporations, weekend warriors playing with friends, incursion runner looking for a change of pace, **** even mike azariah participates in pvp through organizations such as spectre fleet. these communities are not a hinderance in anyway to players getting involved in a corporation, if anything they are the gateway. one and the same. you'll also noticed i referenced material from currently sitting csm members who view this in the same light as i do, and are either proposing ideas themselves or looking for feedback on possible mechanics.that's neither my job, nor my choice. there are many ways of implementing this that would achieve the desired result. i don't get to direct the entire development process, and it's extremely likely this process is already underway. if elected to the csm, it would be my focus to ensure that no matter what version of the redesign ccp has chosen to pursue, it would be beneficial for everyone of where they live in new eden or what they do."
1/6/2015,+1 for op!herding a npsi fleet to consistent success has to be good training for working with ccp on the csm.
1/6/2015,supporting the chief !!!
1/6/2015,"ahh jayne, the entertainment train that never stops. you know you should be worried if lex and i agree on anything.so a few points which i doubt you'll answer but should nonetheless be presented here:1. you have a long long history of scamming, drama mongering and outright lying to people in eve which you were suppose to work with. i'm not talking about some dinky little unknown corp where you awoxed a member and then kicked some inactives you actually went out of your way to falsify information and attempt to incriminate others for your twisted obsessive plot. you've even recently stolen billions in assets from the alliance known as overload everything who's 2ic, doom, you were seen only a few months ago having beers with in person. you even failed to grab a position in the last csm election according to some because of your crooked methods. now your answer to that is ""this is just a game."" that much is true. but if flying npsi suddenly makes you the posterboy for the movement and gives you the credentials to run a csm campaign on that platform, what does all the lying and drama mongering say about you as a candidate? at the end of the day yes scamming is part of eve, but when it comes to running an organized and potent csm team, is that what the players of eve need? why does playing eve the way that you do give you credentials for the csm in one instance but is only regarded as ""just a game"" when it doesn't suit you?2. your big selling point is that you created spectre fleet and that your experience in running public fleets gives you the credentials to be a csm. yet even spectre fleet was created by drama mongering in bombers bar, awoxing the main fc, tempelman n, something which you lied about. we can say this is excusable. but what is really concerning is that you contradict your own position on a very basic premise. npsi is suppose to not be about corps yet this internal mail where you allow your members to refer to you as a certain dictator of the third reich, a title which you seem to adore, clearly shows an elitist attitude where spectre fleet is simply an extension of your corp to use and to wield for whatever whims you may have. sash has been referred to as ""more of a cult than a corp."" how do you answer these criticisms?3. last election year you were listed as a candidate on the official cfc ballot. even with the cfc's backing you failed to take a position on the csm but my question is how can you talk yourself up as a person of the npsi community when you seem to be sitting in the same corner with one of the major nullsec blocs? what assurances do we have as the voter?4. lastly, none of your suggestions really bring anything to the game. everything you described pretty much already exists within the corp model or has out of game alternatives. the elements you want to take from the corp model and applying it the npsi community already has viable alternatives. your ideas are not fully thought out or developed and your platform is a mile wide but only an inch deep. unfortunately your bid for the csm seems to be more about yourself rather than the people you (supposedly) wish to represent and that this position, like spectre fleet, will simply be used to further your position in game. with your history of drama mongering, dishonesty and could we say, right narcissism (?) why would anyone vote for you? not only would a csm seat be out right wasted, your history of sabotaging (attempted or other wise) your partners, your presence may actually be a detriment to the process all together."

1/6/2015,+1 from me - grabs popcorn to watch lex and seraph embarrass themselves.
1/6/2015,"i started my eve career like most, mining and doing missions and learning the game via the starter npc corp. i was recruited by anger kidd of aegis requiem and the wonderful world of corp dynamics was opened up to me and i fell in love with game once more. learning how to pvp within my new corp left me hungry to learn more and to become an fc myself. after a friend recommended i join bombers bar i was now initiated into npsi fleets, i never turned back. i met jayne and flew with him several times while in bb. it wasn't until the fall of bb and subsequent rise of a new npsi community (spectre fleet) that i truly got to know jayne as a community leader and a fc. jayne fillon's passionate commitment to the npsi community shows in every event he hosts, as well as his commitment outside of the game. his talk at last years eve vegas outlined not only his commitment but where he see's this community growing and with growth comes a need for voice.that voice is jayne fillon. jayne fillon for csmx"
1/6/2015,"hi seraph! thanks for helping me win a bet.i promised myself that when you eventually came around i'd respond to you once, and only once, so here we go.you're comparing apples to oranges to here, and it just doesn't make sense. scamming, metagaming, and espionage are all parts of eve, parts of eve that are not only supported through the existing mechanics, but supported by the developers themselves. i've engaged in these activities previously and i'm not ashamed by that, nor do i think it diminishes of my other accomplishments. put a different way, what i do in game has no affect on my compulsions in real life when in a professional setting, this much should be obvious. as it's been said countless time before, ""welcome to eve.""yes, i had beers with doom in vegas along with a lot of other wonderful people. i greatly enjoyed my first player gathering and will certainly be attending again in the future. regardless of our interactions in game or how they eventually ended up, i wasn't trying to buddy-buddy him while in vegas with a malicious intent to deceive. that's ridiculous. even if i met you at one of these gatherings, god forbid, i would pay you the respect you deserve and treat you like a normal human being instead of an internet villain.i fail to see why this is a difficult concept.you're grasping at straws and pulling cheapshots now, none of which are even remotely relevant to the csm, but i guess i'll answer them anyway. first, just like the efforts of agony empire, rvb, tuskers, vengance inc, stille gewalt, furtherance, et al, npsi communities have been formed and managed by corporations since the very beginning. sash started spectre fleet, and for a long time the only fcs in spectre fleet were the fcs from my corporation. that is no longer the case, but that's how we had to do it to get things started. as for ownership of the community, at the end of the day i own the channel, the mailing lists, the teamspeak server, website.... i own everything because someone has to. if you find some other way of running an npsi community, please let me know. otherwise, i'll simply let the results of my methods speak for themselves.my title is a reference to the hyperbolic statement ""literally hitler,"" and it's a joke. get over yourself.i have literally never heard about our corporation being called ""more of a corp than a cult"" so i'm just going to assume you made that up. internally we have a joke that sash is an ""elitist social club,"" which originated during the early days of our corporation when we did nothing but run with spectre fleet. the members of my corporation were so focused on building up spectre fleet to be a successful community that we didn't do anything together as a corp, at all.thankfully those days are over and we can fly together as a corp more often now. not sure what else you're looking for here.this sounds like a regurgitation of gevlon goblin's election analysis. i was far from the only non-cfc member listed on the official cfc ballot, most notably ali aras was prominently included. to say that i failed ""even with the cfc's backing"" is a bit presumptuous. i was quite low on the cfc official ballot last year and was eliminated before any of those votes trickled down. i have never been in any cfc affiliated alliances, or any nullbloc for that matter. i was included on the official ballot for other reasons, reasons that i would like to think included my writings and technical knowledge of eve, which has been showcased in my various articles on themittani.com. everyone is entitled to their own opinion - and i'm sure that those who agree with me, instead of you, will show it with their vote.okay, now that that is finally over with, let me reiterate. even if you respond (which i'm sure you will) i will not be humouring you with any more answers in this thread, bar none. you tried desperately last year to derail my csm campaign thread, and succeeding in getting it locked, forcing me to recreate it. you tried to get me banned from the game by posting articles on en24, and your posts here are nothing but a continuation of your obsessive vendetta against me.i look forward to your next article on en24.it won't stop me."

1/7/2015,"there were two issues:* not working on spaceships.* macro-transactions ($70 monocle) with discussion of pay-to-win.they blurred together into one storm of childish rage we call the summer of rage. ccp just basically murdered everything worth doing because of it, because they weren't able to discern the issues in question from their plans.pay-to-win was never actually on the table. a hypothetical opinion piece in an ""opposing viewpoints"" setting, in an internal newsletter only intended for employees was the only source that that might be a thing. it's ridiculous to believe it was going to happen, because it wasn't.the reality is though, ccp needs to work less on spaceships. spaceships are the best working part of their franchise. and also the least important. this is a political game more than anything else, and the social components are the rot that is going to kill it. walking in stations, corp management, etc. is what needs love and attention.also, ccp is leaving money on the table by not doing wis. in addition to the fact that the game would attract many more players with wis, there's a valuable micro-transaction market in customizing your quarters. buying different furniture or such. there's a lot of useless hangar items we already have, like ship models, books, etc. which could also be displayed in our captain's quarters if we have them."
1/7/2015,"four, actually: 3) their development model was unbelievably wasteful. among other things, they had the art department do a full, final mockup of cq for each design iteration. i'd bet that the artists still have nightmares about that.4) they completely forgot that they were designing a game. no, seriously: i think it's been pulled down, but there was a promotional video from ccp talking about their investment in virtual high fashion, with carbon technology being used in displays in real-world designer stores and so on. nothing to do with eve, or for that matter, wod. when i say that our characters walk like runway models, i mean it: the animations are motion-captured runway models, intended to show off virtual fashion. and while there's nothing intrinsically wrong with a broad range of options to make your character a distinct individual, ideally the focus would still be on making them distinct individual characters within the game, in ways that match the lore of the world.the hilarious thing is that the monocle succeeded as designed. they've sold decently well, and they're used to convey conspicuous consumption, exactly as they were meant to. you don't have to pay real-world money, of course, but that still gets across that you're (space-)rich enough to blow a tremendous amount of isk on a cosmetic item.so basically, ccp flubbed the execution badly, except for the monocle (ha!). if they go back to the original 2007-ish vision for ambulation, and if they apply the rapid-development tools they now have and use them within their new development practices, i believe they can do a much better job of it, and without neglecting their game or traumatizing their art department this time. will they? signs point to 'not any time soon.' for one thing, i think the eve 2.0 project is a much higher priority, and i have to agree that that makes sense. the more old, creaky code is ripped out of the game, and the more love the underlying engine gets, the easier it will be for ccp to enlarge the game without getting ensnared in awful old legacy code, and the more likely that they'll have the player base behind them when they decide to try it."
1/7/2015,"honestly, my personal feel, is that if you talk ""eve 2.0"", they should stop trying to fix the eve client. ccp's current other projects (dust, legion, valkyrie, etc.) use unreal engine, which is an industry standard product that's easy to work with, compatible with everything, etc. elite: dangerous and star citizen are both planning to implement comprehensive scifi universes in a single game. ccp should figure out how to consolidate it's existing unreal properties in the future, and use valkyrie as the starting point to developing a replacement for eve. with a first person ""walking in stations"" viewpoint from the getgo, and moving from small single-person ships up to large multi-crewed capital ships.but i really don't think ccp will ever do that, to be honest."
1/7/2015,"everyone is anticipating the announcements that are due in the next couple of weeks. even moreso, the bulk of the residents of null are holding their breath before anything significant occurrs (ie no real wars etc). not only do we want to know how sov is going to change, but we want those changes implemented as soon as possible. don't worry about 'shaking up' current null, its already broken."

1/7/2015,"being a logi pilot i need very high navigation skills. so, it is actually worse than that for the average player to get into warp. 4% and declining. the loot is going up because there are more organised, large alliances around the size of yours still doing, really well.i am talking about the ~10 man corps that go into a c1 or c2 and hope to scratch out their future. they can't keep out the scanning frigates and frig / destroyer swarms."
1/7/2015,from here:
1/7/2015,"sorry, but the base time to align/warp in a covetor-hull ship (covetor or hulk) with no skills/gang bonuses is 19.13 seconds, which means 20 seconds to actually warp away. that's the worst time, unless you are doing something like mining while running a mwd. maybe you do something like that in high sec to avoid miner bumpers. maybe. when i mine, i mine in low sec, so i don't know what the latest meta in high sec belts is.then again, shouldn't we be teaching miners to mine correctly? using the higgs anchor rig, not only is agility greatly increased, but the align speed is under 30 m/sec, which means it's easier to mine while aligned."
1/7/2015,"+ the time to select the right thing from the overview or people & places.if i feel there is a high risk of threat, then i will mine between 2-4 warp off points slow boating at 76% speed. other than that, i tank right up and my friends will jump on you (u"
1/7/2015,"""for example; it can take a sabre 1.7 seconds to get across 16 au in warp. it takes 20 seconds for a miner to click on a location and get into warp. if the pilots both react at the same speed to each other, there is literally no hope for the miner.""guess what? mining ship isn't suppose to stand up to a pvp ship. you know what will give you equal footing? your own pvp ship.-1your entire mentality reeks of themepark-esque notions. terrible."

1/7/2015,"[quote=tora bushido]greetings social corp/ npcyou shouldn't be able to stay longer then 2-3 months in a npc corp. players should be able to create small social corps with max 10 players in it, which can<U+FFFD>t be war decced (can still be ganked). but they also can<U+FFFD>t own a pos, poco or future structure and they can<U+FFFD>t war dec someone else. this might look bad, as they can freely do anything they want, but if you look at it more closely, they can still do the same things as they could do in an npc corp. only this way they have the chance to build up a corp. see it as a stage between npc and a corp.whilst i agree players shouldn't be in an npc corps longer than a few months to deny them the possibility of owning a pos as a small group would deny them a part of the game where they cannot develop bpos as you need a pos to do this, unless of course you can get ccp to reverse bpo research back to stations.i run 3 accounts and 6 of my characters run a pos quite successfully for bpo research and manufacture in high sec, are you telling me i should no longer be able to do this as a little guy?there are lots of individuals who are also runnig solo corps of 6 charchtes or less. i play this why as i go by the maxim in eve trust no one.i apologise if this has already be brought up but its difficult reading 11 pages on a phone."
1/7/2015,"the social corps are a choice. just because you have less then 10 players, doesn't automatically mean you have to be in a social corp. want more profit and options, then you've got to take more risk too. just create a normal corp and setup a pos."

1/7/2015,"both you and dj funkybacon got many votes from primarly the lo-sec part of new eden, plus the votes that trickle down through single transferable vote (stv).from funky's show and lack of updates on his blog site plus this controversy from a (former) top tier ccp dev,i get the feeling ccp games as a company is finding the csm's opinion less valuable.is this due to perhaps the csm 9: not speaking as a combined front like with the csm 8 or the lack of csm officers in the csm 9 or ccp reverting back to the bad old days ?"
1/7/2015,"i feel that my opinion is valuable. i would not stand for a second election if i did not.each individual on the csm is responsible for their choices, effort, and the work they put into the position. we are seen as individuals, not as a single entity. having officers did not decrease or increase anyone's potential as a member. i do not believe that ccp is reverting back to bad old days. the new cycle is bringing new challenges. the members of the csm must develop habits and behaviors to meet them. they put out the energy make sure that the players are represented."

1/7/2015,i don't think anyone deserves another seat in the csm as much as sugar kyle.i wanted to know your thoughts on combat boosters and if you had any ideas on how to improve them. would you be willing to have ccp take another look at them or do you feel they're mostly fine as they are?

1/7/2015,"i think as we all saw from matias's run last year, founding a thing that is successful does not necessarily grant you any credentials that makes you useful on the csm. your ideas might be nice, but as before stated they add very little to the actual game as far as the grand scheme of things is concerned. you now have your own corp rallying around this thread blotting it out with worthless noise. i've been a ceo longer than you've been playing this game and i wouldn't count this towards credentials to being a contributing csm member.vov vote for jayne if you want another matias i suppose. ccp will not care about the topics you bring to the table and you will contribute nothing to the discussions that others will bring to the table. gl in your run.there's no use crying after every mistake, you just keep on trying 'til you run out of cake."

1/7/2015,"i've been in pretty close contact with jayne (we were almost alliance mates there for a bit!), mangala, and sugar over the last year and i think the world of all three of them and the work they've put into the game.i love the idea of npsi groups, they provide a very interesting gameplay approach to eve that is unique to eve, and that's great. the more tools ccp can provide to players to approach the game in their own way, the better. obviously ccp will always be behind the curve to some degree, but that's understandable.i'd definitely be in support of additional tools and organizational structures that npsi communities are interested in having, though my personal feeling is that it's of the utmost importance to iron out the traditional organizational structures first before turning attention to npsi organizations. they're niche and unique and require abnormal support from my understanding, and due diligence needs to be done to ensure that they retain that unique, niche aspect.to your second point, i'd also be highly interested in more granular ""corporations"" that aren't as robust as full corporations with their own drawbacks and advantages. i'd approach this topic with my general mentality: what gameplay element does it provide? what are its advantages? what are its natural disadvantages? what disadvantages should be leveraged against it to keep the risk/reward scale balanced? it's an interesting time to be having discussions of this nature too, as i imagine that the corporate and alliance rework is - if not close to completion - at least in its late design stages, after which the momentum and leverage gained there may be applied to new ideas such as this. having csm members who are aware and open to implementing engaging new mechanics like this is definitely going to be important in the near future."

1/8/2015,"no. hell no.the sovreignty mechanic needs to be put in with deliberation and flawless execution - which takes its toll on time, not some botched up, quick patch that would break things and bring out a bugfest of exploitable scenarios."
1/8/2015,absolutely this. pushing for a quick fix to a problem this complex is how we ended up with this mess we have now. this thread has degenerated to the point it's become like two bald men fighting over a comb. -- doc fury
1/8/2015,because ccp rushing features to meet deadlines has worked so well in the past
1/8/2015,"you understand why ccp went to a six week release cycle, right? because they tend to break things they rush to finish in time for release.also, we want a solution to the problem that is null sov, not a half-assed rush job that will make ccp do even more work to fix what the players break."
1/8/2015,uhmm no.the csm needs to give input and feedback to proposed sov changes. that's all.the csm does not need to champion when the changes go into effect. the csm should not have and does not have control over the coding or quality control. they cannot anticipate or deal with the bugs created within game itself or effect how many resources ccp devotes to the changes. it would be like a child stomping his or her feet and demanding a new toy. please lets be adults and await the changes patiently. you can warm up your flame posts later
1/8/2015,"op: lets give you a small history lesson of rushed sov mechanics shall we?in 2004 ccp launched exodus, which was the first the first time players could actually claim sov. for some odd reason, ccp decided to link pos' to sov. you needed more pos' then anyone else and it gave you sov. ccp in there brilliant wisdom never saw how stupid this idea was. so started the pos spam wars (if you have a system with 5 moons, and my alliances placed 1 large tower and you came along and placed 4 small towers, at dt that day i would lose sov to yoru 4 towers.)later ccp resived this and created a weight system. 1 small tower = 1 point 1 medium = 5 points and 1 large = 7 points. thus starts the era of spaming large towers.later ccp revised this yet again, and made it so alliances can only deploy a max of 5 towers a day, and sov would take effect in 7 days.shortly after this, (07/08 i forget) ccp decided that if the above was not bad enoughm they would implement contalation sov. which would lead to a stupider idea of regional sov (never implemented thank gods) essentually, if you owned 51% of the systems in a constalation, and 3 stations, you could declare a station system yoru capitol. and everthing in that system could not be attacked until the sov fell below 51%. thus you had the skyrocketing rise of titans, and suspers, and the start of more meta gaming then spaming. an established alliance like bob or goons was near impossible to remove without a crap load of effort. worst idea ever. still tied to pos. was suppose to give us new tools but was left for ""oh shiney!""then in 2010, ccp finally got smart and untangled pos' from sov... sortof. and created dominion sov. this new fee based sov, tied to structures not pos' and the proliferation of titans and supers due to 3 years of every alliance making them with zero issues, brought us to the new renter alliance system. as no small alliance could compete without being steam rolled.yea.. half assed ideas that once made took years to adjust and were left to fester. no, i think ccp can take all the time they need to do it right this time thank you very much."

1/8/2015,"who would you actually borrow money from? npc's or players?so, i make a 30 day char, borrow 3 billion with basically no collateral, buy ships, put them onto a courier contract of my other char for exceedingly low collateral. i fail the shipment and steal it. 30 day char goes bankrupt, i keep ships in rough value of 2.5bil. repeat the process. hell, i can keep creating chars and accounts all year long for that. it's like free ships."
1/8/2015,i would rip this system for all its worth then buy plex to set up another account to do it again
1/8/2015,"i would favor this, but i would have one very strong condition.the prior name and history of the character must be made available in the biography of the character. it would be read only and not editable. all standings would remain the same, the employment history would also remain. nothing other than the character's name would otherwise change. the date the old name was assumed and the date of the change would also be noted.yes, if you apply to a corps they would see the old name. it would be up to the owner to explain the change. all other similar name changes would be noted in biography."
1/8/2015,their former name should show up in their character info like corp history.
1/8/2015,"one element of eve that differs from most other popular mmos (besides older stuff like uo) and makes it stand out is that almost everything can be destroyed. while this is mostly what makes eve great and refreshing (at least for me) this has some disadvantages.player corporations: all this stuff with intel, spies and disbanding of corporations makes a lot of players risk averse (me included). not to mention the disappointment and other negative effects the crushing of a flourishing corporation/alliance has for its player and community around that corp/alliance. the current corporation/alliance system is also much too rigid in my opinion, because there are not enough tools or too complicated tools to handle (as far as i can tell from what i read and seen myself in game) these entities. e.g. you cannot trade shares for a corporation, just to mention a topic currently discussed somewhere around here.further, there is a slight asymmetry in how npc and player corporations play out: you cannot ""work"" for a player corp, you are only a member, but at the same time you can work for several npc corps but cannot be member of most npc corps. while this is actually not a problem, this gave me the following idea:suggestionseparate player corporations from player groups/communities. transform what are now player corporations and alliances into something similar to what in most other mmos guilds, clans, whatever you like to call them are; lets say groups and alliance (several groups in one alliance, to keep the two-tiered system) so alliance stays pretty much the same.but: change player corporations so that you cannot be a ""member"" of that corp. make them more like entities players can fight over in various ways. corporations own assets like ships and stuff. i would even go so far that only corporations can own larger assets like stations and capital ships (so no privately owned titan) and only authorised players (individuals, groups or alliances per access controls) can get access to these assets in varying degree.further, only corporations can own space (sovereign null).corporations can have possibly different modes of administration (how many people are in charge of administrating which corp assets). in case the corp is not privately owned, shares can be sold on the market. possibly offer different types business models suitable for different sizes and operations of corps. a high-sec mining corp won't need much assets besides corp-owned orcas and therefore not much to administrate. a null sov holding corp with cap fleets and stuff will need much more administrative tools.this will open many more possibilities for content creation. your player group can try to buy out certain corporations via the shares, or take it over by force, or add even other possibilities, drive them off the market so that the corp goes bankrupt, etc. set up goals for a corporation, let shareholders vote for what the corp should do to make profit if it is a for-profit corp, let the shareholders receive dividends, etc. since by destroying a corp you no longer also destroy a player community i imagine there can be much more flux in the corporations landscape, space and assets can more easily change hands because there could be several different methods how corp assets and corps themselves switch owners, trading caps can be easier, etc.as a player group you would no longer own space directly as it is now, you would have interest in corporations your group has founded or taken over that could own space. the threat of spies is somewhat reduced to a level where it is not something that can destroy a whole community but still remain as an option to ""steal"" assets und thus is more incorporated into the gameplay.please discuss."
1/8/2015,"a ""good fight"" is subjective. what you want is to be able to hide your industrial ships because you believe that the war ships and indy ships should never interact."
1/8/2015,incorrect. there would be more at stake and you can bet that the ball will be dropped more than once. a tool is only as good as those using it.
1/8/2015,your op example denotes that you feel industrial ships are too easily killed by attackers. defenders already have the majority of advantages. local as an intel rule. you have infrastructure to reship. you have your own allies. what exactly is the issue?
1/8/2015,cloaked ship has the intel. from that they can plan and launch an attack at their leisure; that wipes out the defenders or move on to a softer target.
1/8/2015,i asked what the issue is. you respond with cloaked ships having intel and that they can launch their attack when they choose or move on. why is that an issue?
1/8/2015,"""majority of advantage"""
1/8/2015,how about this. you list and number all the advantages the attacker has and i'll list the advantages the defender has. go.
1/8/2015,"seraph ix basarab wrote:how about this. you list and number all the advantages the attacker has and i'll list the advantages the defender has. go.attackers: cloaked intel cloaked warp to point afk cloaked ship that can spring at *any* time unknown numbers that can cyno in shared corp book marks increased power creep over the years. new interceptors, cheap, very fast and immune to defense bubbles. bombs. cheap bubblers like sabres increased warp speeds mobile cyno jammers the unwillingness of players to wait around to counter drop or react to defend every day miners (naturally enough) the lack of tools a miner can use on a barge to trap attackers. lack of mobility of defenders to other systems. cheap destroyers that have the damage of cruisers and the speed tank of frigates anonymous alts. spies awoxers. edit: that it takes less time for 5x cheap destroyers to leap into a system and blow a miner away than it takes for ratters to wake up and warp directly to miners.how is that for a list off the top of my head?"
1/8/2015,"pretty bad actually.cloaked warp to point, bookmarks, bombs, ceptors and awoxers? why are things like that even on a list? i mean you can just name any arbitrary thing and list it. half the things listed can be placed in favor of the defenders as well.defenders:-local providing instant intel-intel channels-stations-poses-close proximity to home-plenty of blues-venture which is cheap and naturally stabbed-prospect which has cov ops cloak-cyno jammers-jump bridges allowing quick and easy movement-can easily store caps in near by stations/poses-can set up traps to kill attackers-unknown numbers that can cyno in-cloaked intel-cloaked warp to point-the unwillingness for players to drop on defenders if too far deep into nul-can afk in station forever-spies-awoxers-anon alts-fake edit; maybe the defending ratter shouldn't be sleeping in the first place.your whole mentality just reeks of hand holding theme park style game play. eve is a pvp game. it isn't wow where you can choose to opt out of pvp. you undock, you agree to pvp. industrial ships are suppose to be used to gather resources, not fight."
1/8/2015,"that is your repeated opinion and i disagree.defenders:-local providing instant intel (not in worm holes)-intel channels (not in most of high sec and not in worm holes)-stations (if you can get there before they are bubbled up)-poses (if you can get there before they are bubbled up)-close proximity to home (... and?)-plenty of blues (as pointed out recently systems can only support x number of blues and it takes too long to get there, hence the mini pos bubble to risk a valuable ship and buy some time)-venture which is cheap and naturally stabbed (cute little joke of a ship that is only good for newbies and the t2 version is okay for wh gas)-prospect which has cov ops cloak (as above)-cyno jammers (does not stop black ops, does not stop previously logged off ships / pilots)-jump bridges allowing quick and easy movement (if you can get there)-can easily store caps in near by stations/poses (welcome to escalations and a waste of caps for miners.)-can set up traps to kill attackers (the ones you can't hide from cloaked intel ships?)-unknown numbers that can cyno in (they aren't there remember? they aren't going to sit around 23.5/7 while an afk cloaker sleeps)-cloaked intel (useful up to the point that they know what you can field and have brought something you can't handle)-cloaked warp to point (slow boat between two or more warp off points and use a tractor beam hauler that is aligned to a safe)-the unwillingness for players to drop on defenders if too far deep into null (why? they cloak up and can wait it out until the coast is clear.)-can afk in station forever (denied the ability to play unless they jump clone out)-spies, awoxers, anon alts (close recruitment when you pick out a target)-fake edit; maybe the defending ratter shouldn't be sleeping in the first place. edit: see, this, i can agree a variety of ores but the jump bridges and such would be rather excessive and i can see griefers using combat ventures to grief newbies."
1/8/2015,crap answers. and this game isn't divided between attacker and defender. everyone has the same limitations and everyone is an attacker or defender. none of your criticisms are viable toward the current method and i doubt anyone except renters or carebears would feel the same.
1/8/2015,we have a difference of opinion and i feel you are blind to my perspective. we won't resolve this. have a good time. o7
1/8/2015,i totally agree the mechanic need to be changed in some way cloaky reds sitting all day playing with their dicks go against ccps who new direction of meaningful game play. being able to sit afk for hours and have an impact in game is counter productive to the whole new direction ./me points to iso boxer
1/8/2015,"and they are whiners too, with bulls*** sense of honour.why not make it so that there is a better chance of people suviving.whats the sport in a cloaked bomber with cyno who sits in your system for 3 weeks, and randomly warps to you and blops 12 sins on your butt?? those goat-people even have the crass to say ""gf""!!fix eve?"
1/8/2015,"it depends what you mean. if you mean hot droppers that use *afk* cloak alts then i agree.if you mean guys that use throw away alts in throw away ships then i agree.however, there are pirates that are really great. those guys that go in and rob sites of their salvage or random ships for a song. those guys that use their main character with real ships and hunt in low sec. the guys that pick out a particular person, find them, corner them and blow them up. there are pirates that play like the bounty system actually works and they do it successfully for the profit of the loot that drops.i can respect people that play with the mechanics the way they were intended to work and don't exploit the weaknesses."
1/8/2015,"would you be for removing cloaked ships from local? the issue i often hear is that an afk cloaky person stops people from doing anything in a system. if they vanished from local that effect would stop. if they attacked, they wouldn't be afk and is legitimate gameplay. what are your thoughts?"
1/8/2015,"as said previously, the idea i support is sov structures and force recon hunters.cloakers could still operate they would just have to do it actively."
1/8/2015,"vague answer that didn't address the specifics of my questions, unfortunately."
1/8/2015,thanks for making my point bro o7
1/8/2015,"wait, are you serious about that mining thing?a slot game for miners? what?all other ideas are great, but i honestly can't believe the slot game thing is no troll.edit: a minigame for miners would be great indeed, but not as luck based as a slot machine. that would **** economy"
1/8/2015,would i ever troll anyone ?
1/8/2015,never ever.you da untrollest
1/8/2015,"1. hideout idea seems nifty. something along the lines of the mobile siphon unit which adds more dynamics to the game.2a. your afk while in space is unfortunately terrible. as a cov ops pilot i'm often stuck in space not only for hours, but days and weeks at a time. i don't have the luxury of docking up because my station is many jumps away, especially now that i'm hitting more wormholes than before. i need to be able to go ""afk while in space"" because the alternative is turning the game off for me. you don't want me to do that now do you? 2b. your ore idea hits along a similar idea i had but i don't think randomization is the best thing to do. perhaps i just never had an interest in gambling but i think a mini game for ""maximum efficiency mining"" is much better. say every 10 minutes you play the mini game and based on how well you do your mining efficiency can go up or down. an active miner will be able to mine and profit way more than a passive miner. but passive mining shouldn't be completely stopped either. let's face it, plenty of people have kids, work, obligations but still want to play the game even if at a limited level. if the choice is between having an afk miner that has to take care of the baby vs no player at all, what would you choose?3. no way on the wardecs. people can just make single person corps and hide in them forever.4. agreed on people not being able to stay in an npc corp forever.5. not sure how i feel about dreads. i'm worried this would allow a big 0.0 bloc to have more influence in highsec. right now marauders sort of act like ""the dreads of hs"" and i think it's an interesting niche to be developed upon rather than strangled in its sleep by putting dreads in hs.6. as far as faction police goes...that should be a joinable faction like fw where you can police hs of criminals for lp. throw the npc faction police out...replace with actual players.7. keeping pirates out of hs stations may conflict with idea 6 but it's a possibility."
1/8/2015,i've provided answers to the just for crits lowsec questionaire. look for them on their website sometime soon.
1/8/2015,"so long as you support the upcoming nerf to supers and carriers as a result of a alleged, completely false exploit, and are towing the line of of spreading bull #$# instead of the truth, you have lost any credibility and reason that we should support you, and as such, i encourage others to vote you out.sootsia"
1/8/2015,"or you could try using evidence to convince her to change her mind instead of throwing a tantrum and making idiotic threats, shocking i know but not everybody in eve thinks being a dumb ass drama queen is the way to get what they want.as for you sugar, +1 vote from me as you've already shown yourself to be a decent and effective representative of the players."
1/8/2015,"i can't believe i haven't done this yet.there could literally be no better way to spend your vote than to vote for sugar kyle, especially if you live in lowsec. the most hard-working, dedicated, intelligent and enthusiastic csm member i have ever come across. vote sugar kyle for csmx or have your head checked for brain damage.nideneditor-in-chiefcrossing zebrasmoira corp | villore accords | gallente militia | lowlife on crossing zebras | @niden_gmva"
1/8/2015,"i continually argue that if we have freedom without real consequences and people choose to be horrid to others, it speaks volumes about their personality as it shows their natural uninhibited inclinations."
1/8/2015,"it can be argued either way, back and forth, endlessly. what can't be argued is that eve and real life are two completely different things. just because i do something in game, such as steal from another corporation, doesn't mean that i have only by the grace of god been able to repress those same urges in real life. in eve, theft and espionage are not against the law, they are a part of the game. this is identical to how shooting people in call of duty is a part of that game, and has absolutely bearing on your desires to shoot people in the face while walking down the street.in game, i probably abide by different a code of ethics than you, and that's fine - but just because you don't play by the same rules or like the way that i play my game, doesn't make my playstyle immoral or invalid. for example, i don't agree with what code does by extorting highsec miners, but that doesn't mean i don't support their freedom to play eve the way that they have chosen to play it.that's the beauty of the sandbox."
1/8/2015,you don't need to repeat the same old tired line jayne. we all know in game and out of game are two separate things. the issue is a certain trend or tendency to basically just **** up any organization you happen to be even remotely attached to.in one instance you use your in game play style as a reason to get elected. in the same breath you say that the way you play doesn't necessarily reflect you. you can't have it both ways.
1/8/2015,"my last post here because it is your thread. some of us don't need to repress those urges in real life, we don't have them in the first place.have a good day / night."
1/8/2015,"not to be that guy but i have had people back stab me before, steal the corp wallet and assets. hurts more when its a friend not sure what it says about a persons morals when representing a group of people when actions seem to support that you are out for yourself using questionable moral tactics. i respect the npsi fleets as i used to roam with noir and have worked with bombers bar back in my high sec days. and i respect the work to create and grow spectre fleet. (despite messing with our timer in e reach) i don't know that i could vote for you due to the corp theft thing as it would support a play style that is contrary to building a community. as well as it not speaking specifically well about the choices you might make.tldr scamming, spying, and corp theft are a part of the game but don't speak well about the person committing them."
1/8/2015,"how?they are playstylesthis is a roleplaying game isn't it?we all play a role, and all roles need to be filled.someone has to be the bad guy.just because someone plays a role, such as a thief or a pirate, doesn't mean they in real life will act even remotely similar. as a csm, all that matters is what he will do out of game for us."
1/8/2015,"in regards specifically to the background provided on jayne. i<U+FFFD>m really struggling to see how this would or could impact the csm itself. am i right in thinking that there have been elected csm candidates in the past that have similar histories inside the game? of deception and fraud within eve, who've gone on to serve a successful term unhindered.if you don<U+FFFD>t like this course he<U+FFFD>s taken in game then it<U+FFFD>s probably because it<U+FFFD>s contrary to your own chosen path in eve. which in that case, vote for your own scene<U+FFFD>s prospective candidate instead. or be insightful and note that he<U+FFFD>s aware of the various different careers in eve, and that he would look to support them in their own right alongside his own agenda (an agenda which every candidate has). also i get the impression that the information being brought about here is more of a reaction from those involved in said drama, wanting to diminish jayne<U+FFFD>s tin tin like character. in other words they<U+FFFD>re still disappointed and want to defame. not genuinely worried about any consequences his election may have on the csm. or maybe you<U+FFFD>re right to bring this about, and it<U+FFFD>s just me who can<U+FFFD>t see how it<U+FFFD>s relevant. i mean what are the implications of this? he<U+FFFD>ll break the nda and get kicked off? start his own csm? steal other council member<U+FFFD>s treats at the summits? i just don<U+FFFD>t get it, other than he screwed us over in a sandbox game where it<U+FFFD>s completely permissible, and we<U+FFFD>re still bitter. lastly it would seem whether people from other avenues like it or not, the npsi way of life in eve is now just as viable and as valid a route as any other play style in eve. which means it needs a representative, and i don<U+FFFD>t see many other as well rounded and as doughy candidates as space hitler jayne for the cause. i also had some other more relevant questions for jayne i scribbled down and then lost (sorreh). i<U+FFFD>ll get back to you.twitter || www.tricksofthetrades.net"
1/8/2015,"i can't really say your impression is correct. for my own personal experience jayne had been a junior director in my corp, a position he failed to fulfill and ended up using it as a drama mongering pulpit. i had all but stopped playing the game due to some rl obligations so his actions were more of a turn off than any direct attack on me. it was simply stupid, obnoxious and all together pointless.lex arson and i are in agreement even though we've been quite adamant about attacking each other elsewhere are in agreement. lex was another individual who was not a victim of jayne's drama mongering either but a witness and actually an ally for the time being.he uses spectre fleet and the npsi community as his pedestal but even that was created and maintained by dishonest means. he started spectre fleet specifically to replace bombers bar. he hired mercenaries to attack bombers bar all the while claiming it had been other people. he set up an awox on tempelman and when he quit, he used that as an opportunity to advertise his personal channel. hell, he even tried to work with me to set it all up although i declined to be involved. i mean his whole resume, all his credentials, everything is based off of some sort of drama mongering and dishonesty. nothing is legitimate. so what can he contribute if all his accomplishments are based on farces? mynna or whatever other ""evil goon"" on the csm may have scammed or whatever, but they have legitimate accomplishments and credentials that show ""yea they can actually contribute more than just that."" can jayne say the same?and even if that weren't a problem, he has no actual substance to make up for it with any sort of viable ideas. any sort of criticism leveled toward him is part of some vendetta or conspiracy in his mind. the guy can't even take a critique. i doubt he's even writing his own replies (hi ns.) he has an alt and his corp mates chiming in cheerleading and that's about as far as it will go."
1/8/2015,i literally watched this episode this morning :3
1/8/2015,"to help round out page three on a high note, i was recently asked a lot of tough questions by marc scaurus of themittani.com and his newer project justforcrits.com. although the questionnaire focused on my opinions regarding lowsec, there were a lot of other topic covered that would be of interest to those who wanted a more indepth look into my opinions in other areas of the game.you can read the answered questionairre here:"
1/8/2015,"i actually really like this. it's a fairly solid platform and you may fare as a great replacement since mangala isn't running (from what i heard.) will be watching, so far +1."
1/8/2015,thanks for the folks at cap stable for the interview:
1/8/2015,"do you honestly believe you as a csm member and null sec resident have the power to change ccp games mind to make the new sovereignty system occupancy-based instead of the company's preferred ""no sov"" system with players fighting over objects like asteroid belts instead of over systems. source:"
1/8/2015,a great candidate for a great service!
1/8/2015,"right. you'd like to represent every man, woman and child in eve, but forgot to mention you're part of the largest coalition in eve. which has absolutely no effect on your viewpoints, goals and endorsments.can you reiterate for us tinfoil-hat people what exactly you're bringing to the table that would drastically be better than the already veteran players on csm so far?"
1/8/2015,"well that's the thing, i haven't been endorsed by anyone as a large group. i'm doing this on my own. what i bring to the table is that i'm not the old bitter cynical vet. i've been in wi for 3 mos and 6 days as of this writing. to be honest cfc, gsf, even wi no one has really even acknowledged my running. my time in null sec and my year or so of play sure does have an influence on my viewpoints. as for endorsements i only have individuals. my hope is that the community can see value to a new perspective. i try to look at things as neutrally as possible. i try to see things with the interest of balance and logic. my personal view of the csm, while yes they will have knowledge and passion for one aspect over another, is there to take the voices of the community and relay that voice in a concise manner. try to look at what people are saying and try to distill it down to its core or explore the whole issue.an example would be an evemail i received today in regards to low sec. mention was made to having pirates appear blinking red on overview by default. that i feel is a small part of a larger quality of life issue. lets not just address that. lets look at the overview as a whole. why are so many people installing ""aftermarket"" or 3rd party overview packs? maybe maintain the customization but pull some of the immensely valuable aspects of some other overview packs into the game loaded default.similar to incorporating some of the features and value of eft or pyfa into the in game fitting interface.can i represent every single individual in eve alone? absolutely not. i don't think that's a realistic goal. that's also why there are many representatives on the csm and not just one.i would ask that no one underestimate the value of someone relatively new to the game that hasn't been necessarily hardened by it. i am confident i can bring new and balanced perspective to the table from someone who loves it, logs on every day, and really wants to do everything they can to make eve even more awesome."
1/8/2015,"afk cloaking is a necessity due to the way game mechanics currently work. if i jump into your system while you're ratting, you know what you'll do? go dock up instantly or call 200 of your goon buddies to come back you up. that's completely legitimate, you seek to minimize loss and defend your territory. but why not allow me the possibility to challenge that status quo?what are your own credentials on this matter? how many systems have you ransomed? how many covert operations have you headed? are you not merely a sheep trying to give your opinion about how wolves should hunt?"
1/8/2015,"as i've stated above i look to balance the mechanic as others have expressed interest as well. as for challenging the ""status quo"" i think that's the whole objective of the new sov mechanics that are expected to come out. clearly cloak camping isn't necessary to kill anyone ratting as plenty of ratters die every hour even. i've been on both sides of this and i believe it's a mechanic that should be looked at... also stated previously in thread.edit: also notice my partnership in running with wingspantt basically a guy who spends 90% of his time cloaked in eve."
1/8/2015,
1/9/2015,"you forgot to mention the old e.t. game that atari made, and then had to literally bury it was so bad. another good example on why you don't rush game development."
1/9/2015,"loans used to exist but there was no way to grantee any type of payback which was an issue, now all of these banks or loaners or investments you see are 99.9999999% scams.note: needs more 9's past the decimal"
1/9/2015,"the largest problem with in a game like eve is that there's no consequence on defaulting on the loan like in real life. for example, defaulting in real life means a black mark on your credit, collections calls, liens, etc etc.in eve, you can laugh in people's faces and walk away and there's no threat of repercussions. this behavior is clear through courier contracts without sufficent collateral as failing the contract literally has no consequence"
1/9/2015,"- this would really just be a bonus but under the the jump clones tab on the character sheet, it would be nice with a counter that showed you how many jump clones you had used out of all the possible (taking your skill in consideration.) don't know if i'm"
1/9/2015,"so you are asking for a counter like so....you have 8 jump clones, out of a possible 9.is that about it?destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
1/9/2015,yea exactly!
1/9/2015,there is no point in answering. the answer is there if you ask anyone in a wormhole. you are wasting time asking questions that could be in a faq to newbies.
1/9/2015,"there is no faq for your opinions, which is the purpose of this thread. being condescending doesn't exactly inspire constituents to vote for you either. bit of political advice there."
1/9/2015,"entertaining you is worse because you are argumentative with everyone on the forums. however, i am going to assume that you have never been in a worm hole and never lived in null to spell it all out.in a worm hole, when you notice a cloaky ship you hopefully pick them up on d-scan to know what they are. you will also probably see a worm hole entrance that has appeared because you haven't existed your statics.small corp / alliance 10-30 people.see probes - get safe.asks corp and alliance if they are scanning.know there is a hostile there.send out a scanner shipfind the new entrance.sit on the entrance until they leave (decloak when they exit)de-stabilise the worm hole.spend six hours figuring out if any other ships are in there while remaining cloaked and hidden.you do not go out, you do not engage because you don't know what you are fighting. you do not want to get trapped outside the worm hole, you do not want to waste valuable ships, pilots or pods.null sec if cloaked ships disappear from localevery time they hit a gate they pop up in local when they de-cloakcloak ship comes in - get safe.wait for them to leave.keep waiting for them to leave.they logged off? probably a trap. keep waiting for them to leave.when they hit gates and pop up in different systems then you might come out.spend six hours figuring out if they have covert cyno'ed people into the system.probably leave the system or log off and play another game for a few days.last things consider doing: engage them.go rattinggo miningtry bait them out.they probably know what you have, they probably have more and if you feed them kills they keep coming back or they stay there day in and day out. so, the only tactics that work for worm hole and null defense is overwhelming force or kill denial."
1/9/2015,"in the worst possible case, maybe. my old corp's experience in wormhole life is that fighting outnumbered and often outshipped, and still making a real fight out of an engagement and being good sports about it afterward, earned us a lot of respect and a fair few larger allies--in the wormhole sense that they'll still attack us and expect us to do the same to them, but they'll also invite us on roams, answer batphones (as would we) and team up with us to attack someone larger. it's true that many of the corps we faced could have burned us completely out of our hole at any time, but that just makes it more significant that none of them did.i'm also reasonably sure that too much kill denial is the fastest way to get invaded."
1/9/2015,"glad it worked out for you.in most cases engaging everything loses you ships, time and isk.oh, one main reason to not get burned out is those timers everyone hates, having to leave someone there or a team to get them in when the tower goes out of rf and a team to stop the defenders emptying it before thentwo options there, show cheap ships and look like too much trouble to melt the pos or show a lot of shiny things, few carriers multiple poses."
1/9/2015,"i have lived in null actually. and i'm not ""argumentative"" i'm being a critic. i'm challenging your position because i find it problematic. and you should get used to this sort of thing because as a csm you will be challenged frequently.i'm not sure about the rest of your comment. you detail some situations and my reaction is ""so what's the problem?"""
1/9/2015,that is all.
1/9/2015,"it's also fun! not always, but often enough. we flew relatively cheap (mixed t1/t2) and we had awesome space priests. contrary to popular opinion, you don't need to roll in shiny t3s.we weren't rich (well, except for the guys who were already rich going in), but we didn't exactly have to bust our tails to recoup losses. it was a pretty good run.if it comes to that then yeah, you're in trouble. the closest we got was some guy in a stealth bomber winging torpedoes at our pos shields at some bizarre hour because he was drunk, or bored, or something. i will not dispute that poses need a wholesale going-over, and i look forward to the corporation overhaul."

1/9/2015,"2a. i do expect you to log off or accept pressing a button every x minutes (20-30 or so), if you stay on the same grid. 2b. that would work too. i just want less afk mining. you can do this by punishment or rewarding players. let's try rewarding for a change.3. they can already be in npc corps and hide for ever. there is no difference. might want those npc corps to still pay tax ?5. true, that is a risk.6. sounds fun too. there are many ways to get to the same destination.7. i don't want them out of hs stations."
1/9/2015,then people in station/pos should get ejected out into space if they don't push a button every 20-30 min as well no?
1/9/2015,"no. if you're docked you don't gain anything. afk mining, afk cloaked in enemy system, etc you do have an advantage, so you have to work for it. and like i said before, even if you just move once every 20-30 minutes, you will not see anything popup, as you re active."
1/9/2015,"you realise that an afk miner is just afk after 20-30 minutes, right? being afk doesn't mystically cause your ore hold to empty itself in a station."
1/9/2015,"its not perfect and needs work, but i am looking for something to minimize afk cloaking and mining. any ideas are welcome."
1/9/2015,"great that you pointed that out, lucas.but still - tora's idea about making mining more ""active"" is good.you could even let those miners have their own choice - if they want to afk mine, they'll not make as much profit as someone who plays the ""minigame""."
1/9/2015,"oh don't get me wrong, mining should be more active, but afk timer are completely irrelevant (since if you are actually mining, you're not afk) and minigames are generlally a bad idea (they tend to put people off). the mechanics themselves need to be more active, not just ""here, play are arbitrary minigame to complete your unrelated task because we can't be bothered to improve your gameplay"".all in all though, tora's campaign reads like: ""make it painful and annoying to play most of the game, except wardecs which should be easier""."
1/9/2015,care to explain how increased dec fees and social corps make war decs easier ? what would you do to improve it ?
1/9/2015,"wardec fees are a token change. the problem with wardecs is the mechanics are meaningless, it's just a way to turn off concord. making it more expensive just for the lowest group doesn't fix the mechanics, and to groups like yours would make very little difference. all that does is mean that a small group wardeccing another small group (the times when the wardec mechanics are arguably working best, because they are actually fighting for a reason rather than killboard padding) has to pay twice as much.i'd personally go the other way. i'd keep it cheap to wardec the first few groups, then it would exponentially grow, so once you read 15 or so wardecs, it becomes ridiculously expensive, and 20 or so would be financially unachievable. wardecs should happen in far fewer numbers for real reasons, not just so you can switch off concord for the maximum number of targets. you should need to have to make a choice, ""do i wardec these guys, or these guys"", not ""i'll just wardec everyone"". wardecs need to be given more reason. they should be more than just a concord off switch, they should promote interaction between groups who have a reason to fight each other that isn't just the killboard, like fighting with a competitor for example.effectively what you're doing is saying ""i'll sacrifice this *really tiny change* and you sacrifice this *massive change*"" and acting like it's a fair tradeoff.as for social corps, they are just a way to make up for the real change, which is shutting npc corps to older players. let's look past the fact that to force someone out of an npc corp, what really would have to happen is they get dumped in a 1 man corp, and look at the lack of benefit. if a social corp is just effectively an npc corp, why move them out of an npc corp at all? npc corps already have a much more interesting corp chat than most other corps, and keep everyone on the same level. all a social corp would do is force you into the same situation, but with the added restrictions of having to be either alone, a leader of a corp, or overseen by someone else. not to mention that you suggest they would be restricted to 10 players, so you'd only be able to be social with a very small group of people, and growing bigger would mean turning on wardecs, something npc players have no interest in doing."
1/9/2015,"so you're saying my suggestions make it harder, not easier ? marmite has 100+ wars per week. let's assume they are all small corps. that would mean i pay 100 x 50m = 5b isks per week more. would that make me war dec less corps. i would think so. so you're saying it should be almost impossible for any large mercenary alliance to have more then 20 contracts ? and fun wars should all be removed ? if people are willing to pay for something, why wouldn't you allow it ? if a large null-sec alliance is wiling to pay for srp, you're saying they can't because it costs to much ? isn't that their choice ? did the fact you are at war with us for over a year now, influence your opinion on this matter ? mercenary alliances go to war for profit, just as null-sec alliances take sov for profit. are you saying profit is bad and null-sec alliances shouldn't have more then 20 systems or it will get extreemly expensive to hold them ?i agree npc corp chats are good for new players, because it's a great place to find out how things in eve work. but the next step up to a corp is to big in my opinion, as in most cases they do not get the time to settle down. a social corp could be that in between phase."
1/9/2015,"but in comparison to what you earn and how much you already pay, it would be a drop in the ocean, especially since mercenary corps tend to have many fees paid for by the client. for a small corp deccing another small corp, it would be prohibitive.yes, large mercenary corps should need to make a choice between the contracts they take, or split themselves down to cover more contracts if thats what they wish to do. the current system of ""i'm going to wardec everyone because i can"" is not a good design. you can simply add wardecs for smaller groups until the end of time, knowing that they stand no chance of retaliating. i'd rather you had to make a choice. do i take this contract, or that contract? can i split down into smaller entities to cover both? would splitting down put too much strain on our members covering the existing contracts?and no, the fact that you are at war with my alliance (if you still are, i don't actually check) is irrelevant. even if they did change the wardecs the way i suggest, i'd still expect to be one of the wardecs you choose to go through with, as we provide plenty of easy targets.yes, sov should be restricted, which is why you'll find most null players in support of occupancy based sov. if you can't use it, you'll lose it.except it would just be a boring npc corp. the jump to a player corp would be just as big. you're still saying ""stay safe in this corp or open yourself up to wardecs on that one"". if they existed, i guaranteed that the vast majority of long term npc players would just be them and their alts in thousands of ""social"" corps, arguably making the game less social."
1/9/2015,"we pay around 10-12b in war dec fees a week. 5b would be about 40% more cost. i would say that's a lot for an alliance who doesn<U+FFFD>t have the luxury of moon goo, afk ratting, etc. do you think its ok if we would increase your trading taxes with 40% ? probably not. but still i want this change for war decs, even if it will be hard on my own alliance. so would that make me bad in your opinion or an eve hero ?is it bad design if any big null-sec alliance would send in huge fleets to high-sec to come after us ? is that fair to an alliance as marmites which is only 170 member ? are you saying null-sec alliance should have a max number of players to keep things fair ? or do we just accept that the game you willingly started playing isn<U+FFFD>t always fair and could be evil ? keep eve fun and don't nerf it to death.can you show me your source of <U+FFFD>yes, sov should be restricted, which is why you'll find most null players in support of occupancy based sov. if you can't use it, you'll lose it.<U+FFFD> ? i see you often talk for large groups in eve, but i keep missing your sources that they really agree with you.social corps shouldn<U+FFFD>t be boring, as you can grow your corp to about 10 players. i can have a lot of fun with 10 players in eve. your view on eve players being less social in small corps worries me."
1/9/2015,"it's still a nothing change. 40% on my taxes would still be nothing, i'd happily accept double that. in comparison to how much i make, taxes are tiny, they are 0.75% of a sale (with brokers fees being a further 0.4% or so), so even doubling both would only be 2.3% tax, which would simply get passed on to the buyer. the same way that much your additional fees would simply get passed on to the customer.that could happen under any system, if a larger group chooses to fight back, that's what can happen. you're going off on a tangent here. the thing is, you find it fun, because you're the large group bullying the little groups with your superior power. i don't think that making you have to choose between who you attack rather than just attacking everyone is a bad thing. you should have to make choices.the null sec statement on occupancy based sov is on such source. it's really not hard to find people on board with the idea of shrinking down null groups areas of control.i'm sure yo udo have fun with 10 players, but that's 10 players out of a larger group. someone in an npc corp finding a group of 10 people he enjoys playing with and who are all online together is highly unlikely to happen. beyond it being difficult to find those people, most wouldn't even try, since there's still no benefit to being in a corp with other players. effectively the same change could be made by simply removing npc corp chat, since that's pretty much what a social corp would be, an npc corp without thousands of other players.and of course they would be less social. why would someone who is currently in an npc corp choose to put themselves in a group with other players when they gain no benefit from doing so? people won't just flock to join other social corps simply because they are available, that's why it's not a very well thought out idea."
1/9/2015,"then let me rephrase that. would you think its acceptable to have a 40% less profit ? of course you wouldn<U+FFFD>t. and are you saying it<U+FFFD>s ok for our clients to pay for these losses ? if so, never start a business. i personally don<U+FFFD>t think its acceptable.isn<U+FFFD>t that exactly what large null-sec alliances do to smaller alliance when they take over their sov ? you still haven<U+FFFD>t answered the question, what the difference is between us and corps we war dec and big null-sec alliances who go after smaller alliance. i see no difference here. it<U+FFFD>s all part of the food chain. exactly the reason i think social corps can be useful. start a small social corp and continue to grow it to a basic corp or even bigger. i really hope you are trolling me here."
1/9/2015,"if i had 40% less profit, yes i'd pass at least the majority of that to the customer, and yes, that's fine, that's how business work in the real world. at the end of the day you do things for the profit you feel is acceptable. if costs go up, often so does the price, this is why crude oil prices affect the prices of petrol. are you saying that someone that pays you 100m for a 50m wardec now would not pay any extra if the wardec cost 100m?except you're buying out concord for hundreds of corps for very little isk. i get that you think it's fine to do that, but surely you can appreciate how your targets find that to be considerably less than fine. being a csm member isn't about just pushing what benefits you. no, there is no reason for someone in an npc corp to put themselves under someone else's leadership when all they want to do is mine, mission and be left alone. you seem to think that if they made ""social corps"" and kicked people into them, that they would suddenly want to be more social even though there's no benefit to doing so. that's just not how it works. you not understanding that is yet another reason why you'd be an awful csm member."
1/9/2015,this is probably the 100th time you keep accusing me i benefit from these changes. and we keep seeing facts its actually the opposite. i am going to end this now and tell myself we just have different views on facts and being social.
1/9/2015,"i'm sure it is, and for the 100th time people can clearly see that yout chances are token changes to make it appear like you are losing out along with everyone else. the realism is that you want massive changes to nerf other people's playstyles and small insignificant changes to your own (in in some ways direct benefits, like the ability to run dreadnaughts in highsec to make it easier for you to pos bash small industry corps). i'm certainly not the only one who has noticed this.your inability to understand this and even to understand the basic reasons why people play in ways different to your own is at the core of why you are a terrible csm candidate."
1/9/2015,"i think the only terrible approach displayed here by tora was trying to intelligently have any kind of discourse with lucas kell in the first place.like anslo, veers belvar and other forum trolls, the only response should be...shut up lucas.f"
1/9/2015,"my focus will still be on high-sec, but why not talk about low-sec"
1/9/2015,"oh i see, so he thinks that npc corp players will suddenly be social if they make some corps that they call ""social corps"", and that making it twice as hard for smaller corps to start wardecs with each other is a good idea, and somehow i'm the troll? to be honest, something from someone like you that means nothing.i generally believe that people have enough intelligence not to vote for a self serving idiot like tora, so hopefully he will never make it to the csm, but if by a miracle he does, i give it 5 minutes before ccp gag him and kick his ass out."
1/9/2015,"mike, you've done many fantastic things for the eve online community and you're out there actively in the trenches of the forums actively discussing things with people. i'm definitely giving you spot #1."
1/9/2015,you are on the list
1/9/2015,"sugar:very nice interview on cap stable.you are currently near the top of my top third tier. you have good ideas and you present them very well.i remain impressed. thank you!-- alan mathison, explorer & industrialist, star tide industries"
1/9/2015,"boosters are not fine as is. i like their concepts. but they are are an abandoned, neglected project that received a mild touch up in apocrypha. the general idea is fantastic. i love the idea of making choices and fine tuning not just your ship but your pilot to your situation<U+FFFD>s needs. there are implants that do this to some extent. however, the temporary nature of boosters makes them their own viable series of choices. but they need to be revisited and updated.contraband was introduced but smuggling never reached its potential. instead, it<U+FFFD>s handicapped the market for boosters and caused them to be an inconvenience in a game where we maintain assets across multiple regions and sectors of space. ether the restrictions need to go or smuggling, a completely untapped zone, needs to be brought into the current game.we need more booster types. i think that fine details would be fine. the idea of the explorer selecting a mix to help him hack into systems better at the loss of other sensory feedback is an interesting one. let them potentially harm themselves trying to string out to the max. increase and decrease risks based upon the choices the pilot makes and the skill training they have put into it. it opens up more gas potential in player consumption, acquisition, industry, and marketing. currently the role of combat boosters in the game feels as if it was only the first or second step to a much larger project that was never finished."
1/9/2015,you've got my vote!
1/9/2015,"june:i was more impressed than i thought i would be with your cap stable interview. (that may sound bad, but take it as a compliment, cause that's how i meant it. :) ). i loved your stating that you put the game above the coalition. i think you presented yourself very well and i'll be watching your campaign with a lot of interest!thanks!-- alan mathison, explorer & industrialist, star tide industries"
1/9/2015,so i have been thinking of ways to deal with cloaky camping that wouldn't be broken here is a idea i have been working on new anchor able structure potentially for pos that allows for submarine type pings give benefit to those still at their computer allowing them to warp off to a different safe and re cloak basically deals 1 damage or coded to turn off cloaks over 5au of space but still have to position them in a coordinated effort to depth charge a system and smoke out the cloaky camper. forcing players to cloaky camp systems and walk away for the day to get killed by their inactivity while promoting active hunter killers for blops. obvious concern is leaving these near gates and decloaking people as they enter system this is countered by a 30 second spool up timer and a recharge timer so they cant rapid fire keeping someone uncloaked. gives the deployable team something fun to play with still requires teamwork and promotes people actually sitting at their computer to effect operations in a system. i want it clear i think cloaky camping is funny and a good aprt of the game trying to catch people doing something stupid but it is important. however i do not approve of people being able to effect multiple systems and industry while having logged in in the morning and staying cloaked in a safe until when they return from work. it goes under the same logic as the hobocamping patch for interdictors. if you are going to effect space your ship needs to be at risk. some counter must exist to counter someone sitting idle in a system that equalized the effect to risk
1/9/2015,so what can you tell us about kimsemus? intriguing minds ponder.
1/9/2015,"i believe he's moved on to other mmo's, but i couldn't say for sure."
1/9/2015,what is your opinion as a goonswarm's csm representative about walking in stations ?should it be iterated on: to provide an immersive and superior new player experience to attract female players because of the immersion or emotional attachment to a character to ascend eve beyond the niche willing to suffer through its vertical learning curvesource:
1/9/2015,"i am as of today announcing that i intend to run again for csm 10, i was apart of csm 8 and i believe that i have a lot to contribute to this years coming csm through my years of experience in many different aspects of eve.i am not running under a particular platform persay just with the same goal that i did last time and that is to attempt to help and guide ccp towards bettering the game for all aspects not just in 0.0 where i live.for those people who are afraid that i am again another 0.0 candidate with only care for my own well i am here to tell you that you are mistaken. however i doubt that i could disuade you from this point so i will not bother trying with this.people who know me know what i am about, i am open to questions about my ideas and thoughts towards different topics, keep in mind however any trolling or attempts to derail the thread will be ignored by me.thank you for considering me as a candidate for csm 10."
1/9/2015,vote for sort!
1/9/2015,huzzah!
1/9/2015,"i order to secure my vote i need to know your opinion of ishtars, and if you were a soup which soup would you be.he usually talks sense an generally has good idea, you have my support."
1/9/2015,ishtars i personally do not like but if we are talking from a game balance perspective then my issue is less with the ishtar and more with the sentry drone itself.ccp's inability to deal with the growing issues of sentries while still adding more drone modules to the game is of big concern to me and will be something i would like to see addressed if i were to make it to csm.
1/9/2015,"unless i'm remembering incorrectly, you were widely viewed as one of the least contributing members of csm8.it's entirely possible that i'm wrong, so my question is this:what did you do while a part of csm8, and what is the one thing you are most proud of having contributed to?"
1/9/2015,hello again. :)
1/9/2015,"did you read ""sort dragon<U+FFFD>s guide to diplomacy"" ?"
1/9/2015,"with regards to the first half of your post that is each to their own i guess. i know what i did and how active i was and aside from that the only others that know about this would be ccp or other csm members.one of the things i am most proud about is the changes made to the fleet system including details put into fleet composition and such. take it as excuses but i am never going to be able to tell you for a few years exactly what i had a say in or not.it is important to know that some rumours may have come out regarding my inactivity during the term, the only time i was inactive was when i was away from game due to real life issues for the last month and a half of my term."
1/9/2015,i wrote it.
1/9/2015,you never did answer that soup question.....
1/9/2015,at least jail is your first good excuse for being inactive. do you really want me to drudge up the exact same complaints that were fielded last time? or do you have enough mindless mongs to support you again?
1/9/2015,aha. so getting a lot of people behind you and abandoning after vote was your initial plan?! :cough:hbc:cough:
1/9/2015,"be advised... if he doesn't like the answer, you'll never get it from him.just like all of the questions around his inactivity for multiple years prior to csm8. fortunately for him (and unfortunately for the csm), he left pl and got in on the hbc vote."
1/9/2015,pumpkin because i love pumpkin soup and i can't get a good kind here in the uk.
1/9/2015,"go ahead. :)i believe i screwed up a lot in the past specially with how i handled the hbc situation and my main role in its downfall. since then though i am happy to find myself in a great alliance with some really decent allies.i guess things turned out well for me though so i am happy. the results of the vote will determine what people think of me win or lose. thanks for the free bumps though, its good to have my thread at the top for more exposure they do say any publicity is good publicity even in politics. :)"
1/9/2015,do you know why many considered you to be ineffective or inactive member of csm8?why did you apparently not attend a single session during the csm8 summer submit remotely via teleconferencing?
1/9/2015,"no i do not unfortunately.with regards to your second question i did not attend them because i had just started a new job at the start of august which ran on a 3 month contract till the start of november.it is commonly known from people who have been on csm and know of how the summits work that if you are a euro and do not get time off work it is hard to get in on any of the summits as they all start in the early morning eu and finish around about 17:30 in the evening. for the winter summit i however did not have a job and attended nearly every summit meeting.if anyone is wondering i am currently unemployed and even if i had a job i would intend to have the time off for the summits that came up. this is one of the biggest issues for people who are euros and want to attend summits, you need to be a student or someone who owns their own business to be guaranteed to be able to make it.i hope this explains and answers your questions."
1/9/2015,how many of the sessions minutes did you write up for both summer and winter summits?
1/9/2015,"first one none, second one i helped look over the write ups for the second set as nearly all were done by people attending the summits and then editted by people who joined in by lync later on."
1/9/2015,"not in your case, i'm afraid. the more people know about you is only damaging unless, like i said, you have a large bloc of voters that is going to vote for you no matter what. i am not sure that particular brand of lightning will strike twice."
1/9/2015,you are welcome to your thoughts but a lot has changed in what is now 2 years. the people voting for me know enough about me to make a decision to vote for me so i will leave it up to them.
1/9/2015,"it's your reputation against your word.try me. to me, your op makes me feel like you've blown this all off as a trivial necessity to be eligible for csmx, and are completely apathetic towards inspiring people outside our your coalition to vote for you. so let's try this again, and let's keep it really simple.first question: why should i vote for you instead of someone like manfred sideous, sion kumitomo, or endie von posts?second question: if you are not running as a bloc candidate, are you going to encourage the pilots of your own alliance to educate themselves before voting, or are you going to present your allies a prefilled ballot and ask them to tow the party line?"
1/9/2015,"whats your thoughts on fighter assign. both in small scale, 20 fighters assigned to a few interceptors and large scale where fighters are assigned in huge amounts (several hundred)"
1/9/2015,enlighten me.
1/9/2015,"the game has gone full circle from 4+ years ago where the nc used to assign fighters to fight insurgency and tri, it was a strange mechanic back then and a strange mechanic now. i believe the so called nerf is a band aid and will not change much with the mechanic itself. i think a medium needs to be found where the people assigning fighters put themselves more on the line and the people who use drones are not unbeatable that it kills any potential for fights small to large scale.i am not sure how to fix it at all but along side the sentries issue i still have a big issue with anyone being able to control anyone elses ships damage. i believe that any type of game play where you can afk and do nothing is not good game design. the more ships on grid the more people have to put them at risk. the only good i do see from fighter assign is letting 1 side be able to semi even the playing field with another bigger group of players, this however does not outweigh the issues with assign and drone mechanics in general."
1/9/2015,"i'm still expecting an answer, and it would appear so is missbolyai."
1/9/2015,"honestly, most exploits exist because of loopholes created with shoddy or incomplete definitions. at the same time ccp runs into the issue of over defining and by extension ""defining"" accepted exploits. this is kind of what happened originally with is boxer and 3rd party programs. they have specifically said multi-boxing is allow but removed a tool from multi-boxers. while i understand their ability to do so they have failed, and it seems on purpose, to adequately define the limitations and complete reasoning behind the changes. multi-boxers are generally extremely worried about keeping their accounts active, which means following the rules. we need these better defined or we risk losing our hard earned accounts. loopholes are bad because they become widespread and then become accepted and then we run into the same issue, ccp changes their minds, and people either get angry, lose accounts, or quit the game. we want definition, the majority of multi-boxers i have spoken with simply want to know why and what they can do. most is clearly defined but alot is not.check out my podcast! my blog!"
1/9/2015,"cloaky camping isn't necessary to kill anyone ratting, this is true. but getting rid of cloaky camping isn't necessary to save ratters either as thousands of ratters do just fine on a daily basis. the argument is flawed and can be applied in reverse just as easily."
1/9/2015,"your insinuation that someone is disqualified for csm because they belong to this group or that group demonstrates an ignorance of what csm stands for! *cue patriotic music* i will not stand for this! *walking out of room*are you really suggesting that mudstone need to cloaky camp a few systems before he is 'qualified' to suggest changes to the cloak system? how many systems have you been camped out of for days or weeks? are you even qualified to ask this question of mudstone?i've been cloaky camped for weeks, and trust me, i don't have 200 buddies to call for help. in my particular case, i actually don't want much changed with the cloaky camping system. though i've never cloaky camped anyone, i wish to reserve that for a possible tool to use against my foes in the future."
1/9/2015,"i've never been cloaky camped into any station, because just as you do, i recognized that the tactic was not limited just to one side but to both. i chose instead to make use of the method myself rather than complain about it and seek to change the game."
1/9/2015,at no point have i said that cloaky camping needs to end. i just think it needs to be a more active activity. we are all playing a game here. so why not make it engaging to both parties? i'm not a game designer. i only seek to take collective voices i resonate with and will attempt to amplify them to the best of my ability to ccp directly if afforded that opportunity.i just think all aspects of the game should be engaging and fun. that's why i log in every day.
1/9/2015,would you support moving cloaked ships from local? that way no one can afk cloaky camp a system and cause people to dock up.
1/9/2015,that's what wormholes are for. so no local is a part of known space and probably should remain.
1/9/2015,i made a post on reddit with the suggestion of making mobile warp disruptors hackable and thereby able to be stolen. the thread is here:

1/10/2015,"the whole purpose for this failed jump fatigue system (as stated at time of presentation of concept) was to limit any group from crossing the entire map in minutes, thus bringing everything and everyone from anywhere to anywhere.i would think that kiss applies here -- keep it simple stupid !so if we must be limited in this fashion a much more simple system can be used as follows:1) simply allow for any number of jumps within max jump range of starting point for those of us who just want to travel within a set region.2) for those of us who trained on black ops, covert jump drives should not be limited. if only because of the requirement to invest months in training for this.3) go ahead and limit the jumping of others via my covert jump portal generator with your fatigue system that has been set up to have variants for certain ships with 90% this and 80% that, but<U+FFFD>.i agree with u guys when you say -- leave jump bridges alonebut -- we all know that this is much like trying to skip rocks across the lake - no matter how many times we try -- no matter how hard we try -- the likelihood of getting game decision makers to agree with us<U+FFFD>.black ops ships using covert jump portals with covert cynos are not allowed to use covert cloaks. that makes sense."
1/10/2015,are the tears really still going after a couple months have passed? probably best for you to find another game to play at this stage. the jump fatigue changes have improved content overall. meaning there are more wars and persons trying to take sov. including small groups.
1/10/2015,"hi, i live in nullsec. pl are two cynos over, and bl a few cynos in the other direction. without fatigue, we would be unable to operate with capitals.then you done goofed son. watch your fatigue next time."
1/10/2015,"just gonna step in and say, fatigue has done more for letting overhyped mercenary wannabes operate with impunity than any other mechanic in history (and you cant deny that accusation, i flew with syj for years, still love you guys, except pell, never pell, okay pell too)"
1/10/2015,anyone alive here ? ;o

1/10/2015,"are carebears the only ones allowed to ask for improvements to eve.gankers are people too :)this would be a massive improvement for fitting out fleets, and has been long needed in game"
1/10/2015,"its not only for gankers, although gankers are paying costumers aswelany smal/med/large corp and alliance can benefit fromit"
1/10/2015,"i disagree with it being just for gankersand it is in my book of things to ask forbig events have people stuck doing fitting for days. whoever runs fleet doctrines often is in the same boat especially if new players are involved. i try to limit myself to 50 ships at a sitting, pace myself, but every day i wish there was a firt and rename all these things buttonwholehearted supportm(go on, call me a ganker)mike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"

1/10/2015,"jenshae chiroptera wrote:i could never go back now, would suck too much: recons. frigate links. worst of all pressing d-scan all the time, can't face that again. i'm genuinely curious to see how recons work out. i don't see how they're necessarily worse than what's already out there. i do know that we tried a pilgrim doctrine before this round of buffs, and it was bad.the frigate links definitely make things more chaotic, and our enablers and instigators were not happy about the new mass/distance relationship when you jump through a wh.hating on d-scan is sort of a wh hobby, so, since you're running for csm: what would you do differently, and why?jenshae chiroptera wrote:as to the rest, i still have a lot of friends that are still in whs. the only one that engages hostiles; does it because they have a standing force greater than anything that can come through a connection - due to the mass limitations.we lived in a c2, so if we needed to, we'd drop short-range (t1) battleships on intruders, taking full advantage of the wh bottleneck. but we also got a bit tired of losing to fleets that sometimes had more guardians than we had pilots, so, again, since you're running for csm: ccp, and for that matter corbexx, seem happy about the state of things and they feel that the metrics ccp is using (mostly # of jumps through wormholes, afaict) indicate overall health. so what would you bring to that discussion?"
1/10/2015,"while ratting or mining i would hit d-scan often enough to see a ship in flight and i could escape. often i would see cloaking ships just before their cloaks flipped on. slower than manually clicking, auto d-scan.there are now shattered systems, the new exploration systems as ccp originally envisioned. allow worm holers to control access again and let them build a full settlement. they can't make a block, can't take over a region of worm holes. stations and system occupancy upgrades.maybe stations only in c5 and c6 with larger holes from there into null. maybe and i say this one very cautiously; rare three day long holes with no mass limit connecting them.i see nothing but good possibilities in letting alliances take over a single system completely. they become this drifting force that spices up the rest of known space and with a station they can turn into real industry places. with the way that ccp wants to have null trading hubs and have small null blocs these worm holes could be the ""tinkers"" of eve, popping up with goods to trade and supply null. friend or foe? could be very interesting.edit: recons will be a ""perfect"" cloak in worm holes. you will need a combat probe alt because you probably won't convince anyone else to sit around doing it. no blips as they turn the d-scan immunity on. no knowing if they left a system unless you constantly watch every exist all the time.scan deep for them in case they have a book mark way out there? nothing stopping them having a regular cloak and a mobile structure."
1/10/2015,maybe you should just respond to people's questions and statements instead of saying post with your main or how about giving accurate sources for your statements or how about not making up random bs to try and make you look good. no one will vote for a lying sack of dung.hey xenuria post like a man.also why can you not stay with a corp very long?
1/10/2015,"xenuria cant stay with a corp very long because xenuria has personality conflict issues. xenuria doesnt get along well with anyone, just a matter of xenuria being xenuria, which is only appropriate company for xenuria. xenuria hasnt undergone the years of training required for one's of xenurias nature to acclimate with normal society to a functional degree.(and so i can stop typing xenuria, what do you prefer to identify as? he/she/it/fox/walrus/klingon/wookiee/visitor/munchkin? just dont want any miscommunications)"
1/10/2015,"maybe this is a good thing but i honestly have no idea who you are xenuria. so my question is, why do you feel like there is such a strong numbered group of people that seemingly despises you? again i'm only asking because i have no idea.i've encountered myself groups of people that flat out contradict me simply because i write a few lines of text on en24. being in a ""somewhat"" public light encourages some people to be asshats to me. ""hey people know that guy! watch this, i'm going to totally tell him off."" however i'm not sure that is the case here."
1/10/2015,"it's mostly that, eve online is like any other game where people are given anonymity and a voice. the difference is eve is brutal and harsh. this mentality encourages people to attack that which they fear or don't understand. i am controversial in no small part because i cannot be bribed or bought off. i represent a clear and sustained threat to the system as it exists in it's present form. this concerns people. ultimately the pronouns used don't bother me but i prefer feminine pronouns in the context of eve.if you are unwilling to read the op or any of the subsequent posts answering the questions your asking than i really have nothing to say to you. at best your lazy, at worst you are attempting to derail the conversation by asking questions i have already answered."

1/10/2015,"i have several points of contention as well as questions regarding the answers you gave to wiggles on eve radio, but rather than create a post a mile long, i would like to just bring up one subject regarding character and how important you think it is for someone to be able to make decisions and provide feedback to the players or ccp based on having all the information (which is a key character trait of a good csm member).you recently published an article regarding nashh kadavr that clearly summarized nashh as ""the host"" of this event intended to scam this event for himself.notwithstanding that you were personally on comms when nashh was being ambushed by iwantisk, by your own admission you knew how emotionally worked up and tired he was after putting on this content for the community's benefit. despite knowing that there were no direct accusations made at that time, you decided to run a half baked story that clearly cast nashh kadavr (a trusted and known content creator in this game) in a negative light, with the title of your tabloid bordering on libel. unlike the story i inquired with you about regarding the groon rmt accusations, you didn't have the courtesy of putting ""supposed"" or ""alleged"" anywhere within the story.my questions with subsequent follow ups are as follows: do you believe that running a tabloid article knowing that facts were still coming out justifies the rl stress this caused to a well known content creator and personality for this game? if so, do you believe that purposely driving out content creators is a good image that we want to set forward going into csmx? furthermore, do you believe knowing what you know now about the incident that it's important to have all the information before summarizing it in a fashion that is completely opposite of the facts?(yes this is all tongue in cheek. based upon your answers given on eve radio and subsequent behavior during the #eve_nt debacle, there is absolutely no way i could ever endorse someone with your values to represent my best interest on the csm during a time when it's involvement and input will be at arguably during the most vital changes in our game's history. stick to tabloids please) eve community blogger - the eve editorial -"
1/10/2015,"i still stand behind the things i said at eve radio which i think answers a lot of your questions. is it good that somebody has stress in rl due to a game? nope but he would be the first or the last player to experience that! the amount of sleepless nights i have are there too. just because somebody did good doesn't mean he is immune to criticism, although i do feel that i could have added a bit more of nash sides at the beginning, but due to his emotional state i decided to give him some room and wait for the next morning. i'm always learning on the go so i guess this has been a good case to take into account next time.in the end of the day i appreciate and love nash work! now this happend, i learned from it, i left it behind me and i am looking at the future"

1/10/2015,"that's not much of an argument. it just means that he's full of ****, too.i just watched sion's presentation at eve down under, and his particular area of expertise is exactly what's required to tackle the current shortage of women in eve, should he choose to do so. it has very little to do with the gameplay, and very much to do with the existing player base.if he does, i'm guessing that he will find an immediate ally in ccp seagull, who is also allergic to the idea that there has to be some sort of ""pink"" gameplay ""for the ladies."" just make the game better."
1/10/2015,"as someone who has been with sort for the past 2 years i can confirm he did change quite a bit, especially during the last months. sort might be a **** sometimes and won't win the award for the most popular person in eve - but he's the kind of person you'd want in the csm because he knows the game, its mechanics and is not afraid to tell his opinion or doubts.anyways, everybody has to decide for himself which candidate fits his own expectations of eve best and what he thinks should be the highest priority for 2015."

1/10/2015,"you need to read the response, rarely are game mechanics black and white, he addresses your concerns quite directly."
1/10/2015,"diversity on the csm is important to me. echoing jayne's question: what would a csm without you, but with manny, sion, and endie on it lack due to you not being on it? what unique perspective do you bring that makes you a valued addition to the csm as opposed to squeezing out a voice from, say, lowsec, w-space, smaller null entities, etc.?"
1/10/2015,"wow jayne i'm surprised you didn't ask him if he steal beats his wife. plus isn't ""tow the party line"" sop from entities such as the cfc that backed you last year? serious question here to sort, how do you envision your ideal version of sov mechanics? what would you change? what do you like currently?"
1/10/2015,"i'm reading from this that you agree the current ability for carriers and supers to assign dps to a different grid than the one they're on, and just sit next to a pos ready to dump the shield up is something that needs changing- is that an accurate conclusion? would you be in favour of a straight up removal of the ability to assign fighters to a player on a different grid from yourself?"
1/10/2015,"that is an interesting question and to be fair i think manny is a great candidate this time and i doubt i would be able to get more votes then him anyway. the interesting thing to look at though is that manfred does not run an alliance that holds sov to live in sov for his members. sion and endie however do but at the same time they both look at different aspects in the game, sion who is very diplomatic and endie who has in the past had his hand in that also.i would never say that i am better then anyone else because that would be stirring the pot and trying to create a fight with other candidates and this i will not be apart of. i will allow voting to dictate who they believe in the list is better suited. if i do not get in i will accept the people have spoken and possibly try again for csm 11."
1/10/2015,"i myself miss the old pos mechanics for sov, after having been through the whole of dominion i miss the old dynamics of pos sov. the chance to have fights at what could be all times of the day and the chance for both sides to play tug of war. this does not mean that i would go back to fuelling 100+ towers a month to hold sov but i would like something a long the lines that allows people small groups who are not harassing but genuinely want a home in 0.0 to have the ability to do so.i see that being possible under the rumours of occupancy sov but i can see there being a lot of issues alongside this."
1/10/2015,"i do like the ability for assigned fighters to effect fights where the people you are against outnumber you by a huge amount, so no i do not want it completely removed however i do not believe you should be a loud to camp gates with drones assigned or rat with drones assigned. i want to see more to be done to see people be able to use supers and carriers more but at the same time put them in a position of threat.i myself own a super and i like being able to use it to sometimes level the playing field when i am against a lot of hostiles but at the same time i do not want to kill the fight because people are too afraid of them."
1/10/2015,"but wouldn't it stop the ""afk cloaking problem?"""
1/10/2015,"it stops cloaky camping as a harassment tactic. but it does not allow for cloaking to be countered.furthermore, as has been stated endlessly, local is unrelated to any game modules. linking them would be much harder than making a game mechanic to counter cloak.the csm has to realize the limitations of the game when they suggest ideas, they cant just demand the same thing whlers have been demanding for years just so they can gank ratters with no warning.if you want to fly in space without local, fly in whs. if you want to gank nullbears, deal with local. its an age old argument, and using it makes you sound like a whiny little girl."
1/10/2015,"i don't remember asking you. but since you decided to chime in anyway, cloaky players have to ""deal with it"" when it comes to local but complaining about cloaky warfare is totally not whining.keep in mind i'm completely fine with local showing cloaky members in system and only suggested it as a way to combat people complaining about afk campers."

1/11/2015,for the sake of argument i won't argue this but i will say that there are much better ways of limiting capital mobility than fatigue. it's really nothing more than an enormous pain in the ass in every possible way and has severely hampered some other times of game play like blopsing which is not longer attractive as it accumulates fatigue.
1/11/2015,"i'd be the first agree that fatigue itself isn't an ideal mechanic - i'd prefer something that makes it progressively harder and less safe to use instant travel rather than just increasing a timer.but whatever mechanic is proposed will, in the end, have to have the same fundamental effect as the jf mechanic has now: making long distance rapid travel something that has extremely significant consequences. and candidly, it's the fact of the existance of consequences rather than their exact manifestation that is what most of the critics are really complaining about."
1/11/2015,"to whom it may concern,hello, i am a recent player of this awesome game, but i am deeply into it already, especially the role-play element, i just find it awesome, and while i understand being ""ganked"" and scammed are actually legal parts to the game, and i love that, but the bounty system i believe needs to be looked at, for intance, you need a reason to place a bounty, you can't place them on innocent players and the like, as i am a very honourable ishukone capsuleer and don't engage in any pirating activities and yet a player placed a bounty on my head, purely for the lol's.. this honestly annoys me to no end as now my characted appears to be a criminal, i would like to ask for a change to be implimented, and if possible the bounty from my head removed if possible.thank you for taking the time to read my request and troubles.regards, alexi duo drakenovicishukone reserve military division"
1/11/2015,"it used tobe like that awhile ago but they changed it, before ya could not place a bounty on ppl that for example robbed ya corp as they had good concord standings etcor like ya wanted to place a bounty on ya competitiondownside now is that they place bounty on everyone yust for the laughsthey have mentioned they want to change the bounty mechanic but unclear how, and looks more like changing it so that there cn be bountyunterswhat they could do is change the wanted into bounty or something so it looks less evil"
1/11/2015,"and what if i'm against ishukone and want to see their interests suffer? or i'm gallente and want to bounty anyone who has anything to do with the caldari?or i want to bounty a bumper, someone who mines the same rock as me, someone involved int he same market niche as me, someone who's birthday happens to be today, someone who is bad at posting here or in local...who gets to define what is an acceptable reason to bounty you, and why is, say, your posting less of a reason than a gank?"
1/11/2015,"in eve... no one is ""innocent.""just because you ""abide by the law"" is does not mean i (or someone else) may not have a problem with you (for whatever reason).in fact, there are many, many ways where you can screw over other players without breaking any in-game mechanic or rule.and before you say ""well, this isn't realistic, innocent people don't get bountied in rl!"" i must point out that this is very untrue.if you take a history or current events course (or two) you'll see many, many, many examples of people having prices put on their heads because they pissed off the wrong people.examples:- native americans in early usa history were scalped for bounties... which included women and children.- politicians in various countries have put bounties on the heads of people around the world for media that ""insulted their religion/public morality/national pride.""- the black panthers (militant african american rights group) once put a bounty on a us politician.the list goes on."

1/11/2015,"i agree with this, it should be the old way (i have read about it as soon as you mentioned it thanks to our good old friend google, haha!) with a few improvements it would make sense.you see, we actually agree here, if you read my original post you would see i am a role-player, i would be okay with a gallente, or an rival doing it, not a random for the ""lolz"" and then saying i am trying to scam them when i ask them about it like a moron. if you were indeed against ishukone then i would welcome it, but what i am asking is different, please read next bit for more detail as i don't think ill have space to type it twice, sorry :( i understand this, i like that fact about the game, once again these weren't for ""the lolz"" and did you not read the original post? i am not that bad of a role-player where i think this is rl.. but i think it should be changed, or atlas removed the ""wanted"" thing on your picture unless you are in enemy space, cause you can't have a friendly corporation, working for a group like, for instance, the caldari navy, who is ""wanted"" by the caldari navy, and onto of that, if you are ""wanted"" you should have the ability to apeal it, or pay something off so it is removed, and high sec should be cut off from you, as i am sure even you guys can admit, even in rl the military won't give work to someone that military wants dead, so to basically point out what i mean:i think the bounty system should be modified to do the following:- if you are ""wanted"" in high sec there should be a way to appeal the bounty (i.e. get it removed/revoked, player who placed bounty does not get his bounty amount returned, punishment for players who abuse the bounty system, ect.).- to place a bounty you must have a legitimate reason, (like they do in rl life once again) and the minimum bounty raised to something higher, or have restrictions, like cannot place on player you have never spoken to or a player who has not committed crimes.i just think it is a system people abuse, and after talking to my mate he has told me it is abused a lot just for fun, like i have no problem if say, a member of the tiber heth supporters, or a gallente player federation puts a bounty on me, but even in rl when you want someone dead, you don't but a few thousand on their head, it's normally millions, and for people high ranking, like ceo's and directors, their should be a minimum, i just want it to be treated like an actually mechanic, not to be used as a fun way to annoy carebears, like the guy who bountied me must have done it to everone else in the system, cause everyone on local was going crazy about it (i was traveling through the forge i am pretty sure..). it is an awesome mechanic but it should have addition rules or requirements, high minimum bounties, ways to get rid of it, ways to get it lowered, consequences for abusing it, ect. and in eve just btw, there are innocents, and then there are though who follow the law, and yada yada, i mean, i even carry a black box and clearence papers in every fit i use, just for roleplaying purposes, and i have not broken any of new edens laws, i haven't targeted non-combatants, all i fight are pirates (npc's) and soon fw opponents.p.s. people in rl don't put a million dollar bounty on a guy because, ""oh.. i don't like that ship.."" or ""the lolz""."
1/11/2015,people in real life aren't demigods with nigh unlimited income. players in eve are.
1/11/2015,"and this is what i mean, point proven, are you at least going to give me a legit reason so i can actually feel good about this? proud even, or is this ""for the lolz""? i honestly don't care how big of a bounty it is, i just want to make it go with the role-play experience, it would be nice when we finally join fw to have a big bounty, but i still like it to fit, know what i mean?i don't want to ruin you gaming experience of trolling people or having fun in your own way, i mean, that is why i love this game, but don't ruin mine, by that i mean give me a reason for the bounty, would make it make sense to me at least"
1/11/2015,"this is true, which also means that they would bother with 50mil bounties, they'd be 500mil-1bil plus, don't you think? i mean if i was a demigod with a platinum american express card i would bounty my enemies into the dust, not put half a level 4 worth of isk on their head."
1/11/2015,"no.that's the point of this system. i do not have to provide a reason that is satisfactory to you before i am allowed to act. i can do as i please, regardless of the reason.that's called player freedom."
1/11/2015,"and this is what i mean, their is no cost to the other player for ruining some players gaming experience, not me i mean, i actually mean that one carebear in local that seemed like he was literally about to kill himself, i like the system mostly, which obviously you can't get into you head, i just think it should be changed, or at least be modified to give other players some freedom in having a choice t remove said bounties, if you have the freedom to place them, then the other player should have the freedom to remove it at a cost, like doing missions for their respective navy to remove it, or special missions for removing bounty, i don't know, but that would be awesome.and it doesn't have to be satisfactory to me at all, but there should be a reason, i wouldn't be satisfied that you put a bounty on me even if you did it for lolz, but a decent reason to give other players freedom to play the game their way, as you seem to demand for yourself, both players should have a way to place a bounty and remove a bounty, i don't care if it costs 2mil for every 1mil removed, or if you have to do 5 level 5 missions to removed it, there should be something, for you know, player freedom and all that"
1/11/2015,"heh, buddy, most bounties are paid out in such small increments that it is quite literally pointless to kill someone just for the bounty. they are without consequence, and absolutely cannot restrict or impact someone else's gameplay experience in any significant way. in fact, the most impact they actually have is to put that wanted poster on your character profile.then i suggest you report him to ccp so that they can contact his local law enforcement. but aside from that necessary action, i do not yield to emotional hostage taking."
1/11/2015,"okay.. firstly.. what is emotional hostage taking? 0_0and i understand that with bounties, and i don't care, to be honest i would have done this threat if the bounty was 1 isk, cause i, like myself, don't like the ""wanted"" poster, however, i do see your point, but it still needs to have the ability to be removed in some way, because if it is in one players freedom to issue a bounty, then it should be that players freedom to love it, or have a way to remove it, don't you think? btw thanks for the bigger bounty, actually makes sense for an enemy of the gallente to have a large bounty, so cheers for that one, even if you think i am 100% against it"
1/11/2015,"when someone threatens to kill themselves if you don't do something in their favor.the correct action is always to inform the authorities, and get them the help they need. but if they're just throwing a tantrum and trying to escalate to get their way, then that is unacceptable.so, aside from trying to strengthen your exceedingly shaky point by bringing up that guy, i have no idea why you would have mentioned it in the first place, as it is not relevant.it can be."
1/11/2015,"yes i know it can be removed via getting podded, haha! that is the reason for join fw soon, so i can get it refreshed constently, can you pod someone in high sec though if they are not flashing red or yellow? even with the bounty? still not used to all the mechanics.and oh.. did know that is what you call it, and it was revelent to the topic, hence why i bought it up, some players take it as a personal offence to be bountied, some take it on the chin, and some fly into a rage, but all players should still be offered the oppertunity to remove bounties or at least the ""wanted"" poster. as that should be their freedom, not all players want to play the game you way, just like you don't want to play it their way, so their should be some one to make it better for both players."
1/11/2015,"why do you believe that you can't put a price on the head of an ""innocent"" person? i'm given to understand that murdering people for money, regardless of their legal status, is a thriving industry in pretty much every country in the world.the bounty mechanic explicitly exists so that you have the option to sanction a player who hasn't broken the (crimewatch) law but who has managed to **** you off in some way."
1/11/2015,"exactly.. read the posts.. people do it for no reason in this game, they do it for the lols.and once again as kaarous has said, we are demigods with unlimited funds, we wouldn't focus on something so trivial, we'd focus on the big things, and once again, people don't just put bounties on people for ""the lolz"" not even trillionaries, they don't just get a name roster, throw a dart and go him, he needs to die, they generally have a reason, even in rl, do people just walk up to you in the street and knock you out for no reason? no? funny that, he must not have had a reason, this is what i mean, i mean, do you actually think that say for example placing a bounty on a brand new player for eve who wants to mine veldspar deserves a 1mil bounty? or wants one? maybe he just wants to mine, no demigod is going to go ""yep, that guy, screw him and his mining ways, he offended me"" no, a demigod, would ignore it, cause our ego's would be so large we'd be more like see that constilation? yeah, screw that, they have more sov and area then i do, and they have a titan"" and would proceed to to nuke it, not randoms for no reason, or do you honestly believe that in real life their are people who sit in their rich house and email their local hitman:*dear mr. hitman,i saw a homeless guy today begging for change on my way to work, from my helicopter window, and i have decided that he will be my enemy this weak, so ill pay you 1000 dollars to fly here here on your own wallet, and then shot him with bullets you paid for, then fly back to where you live,yours sincerely, your boss, mr idiot*that isn't how the world works, and it shouldn't be how eve works with demigods with ego's bigger then titan's, unless you leave house and then feel like executing next doors kid because you know, he has brown hair.."
1/11/2015,ok nice ya still onit hope they listen and aply it
1/11/2015,"i'm not sure after listening to your interview whether i'm relieved that you basically echoed your overall goal of running just as a placeholder on the ballot...or if i'm profoundly disappointed that someone would use an opportunity like this to essentially have no intention of winning and cry #grrmittani as an achievement. no, it's both. there was nothing hopeful, profound, or even remotely optimistic about your entire interview. your thread campain here is all negative with nothing less than vitriol. not passion, but vehement disdain. everything was grr this, highsec isn't safe enough, the whole csm process is a sham, and you can't isolate a single specialty that you can point to as a core constituency source.i understand your motivation and thank you for coming forward, but at arguably the most important time in the game's development history, the attitude you bring to this campaign is the last i want sitting across from people like ccp seagull.good luck, but -1 eve community blogger - the eve editorial -"
1/11/2015,"i was pretty disappointed to listen to that interview and realise that the analysis of your problem with the csm ""process"" begins and ends with you intensely disliking the fact that other players are free to vote for people whom you don't happen to like.equally disappointing was your naive idea of ""votes against"" somehow 'empowering hi-sec'. i'm afraid maths doesn't work that way, sir. if the ebil nullseccers are winning elections at the moment because they can get more votes for their guy, then they're going to keep on winning elections with your idea because they'll be just as able to vote against people they don't like as you'll be able to vote against people you don't like, but that's a contest they'll win because more of them vote.""hi-sec"" doesn't need any special process magic to ""win"" the csm. ""hi-sec"" needs first and foremost for credible candidates who can appeal to voters with a platform a little more sophisticaed than ""grr goons grrr gankers grr nullsec"". mike azariah is the example that leaps readily to mind, and he has been elected twice. deidre vaal had similar success. in fact there's every reason to believe that when intelligent, insightful, skillful communicators run on a hi-sec platform, they are quite well served by the csm process. and secondly, of course ""hi-sec"" needs to vote. your ""idea"" (it's far from new) runs headfirst like every other idea to ""reform"" the voting process into getting more people elected of the type that the reformer likes: there's no voting process that will deliver results without the actual votes. and there is no bigger enemy of hi-sec enfranchisement than people who try and claim that ""the system"" is rigged against them or whatever. you claim to be a student of the mittani's campaigns; you may recall him commenting to the effect that he had zero worries about hi-sec challengers because hi-sec politicians spend most of their energy telling people that there's no point voting. in direct contrast ""ebil nullseccers"" who run for the csm, don't whine about how hard it is; they spend their time getting people to vote.and it turns out that telling people to vote for you is a more successful strategy for getting elected than telling people not to vote at all. such a surprise!thirdly, you can handwave away the facts all you like, but the reality is that a very significant percentage of ""hi-sec"" are alts belonging to players who identify as ""nullsec"" and the fact is that they're not going to follow your banner any more than turkeys are going to vote for a second christmas. since the 0.0 alts are the hi-sec demographic that is the most likely to vote, i strongly suggest you think of some way to appeal to them without attacking their ""main"" playstyle.in summary i would strongly advice you to rethink your campaign from scratch, and focus less on stopping the players you don't like from doing things you don't want them to, and much less on why they shouldn't even want a csm in the first place, and start emphasising how you can help the players you claim to represent do the things they do want to by getting elected to the csm."
1/11/2015,"i really don't think it does concern people that you can't be bought or bribed. every once in a while one individual may get ticked off by it, while the majority of the community will ignore such actions as trivial. you can call immunity to attacks all you want, and the people with power will continue to have successful attacks on others while ignoring you. they do not worry that your mentality will spread, as well they shouldn't. people immune to attacks like you and i are few and far between, and nothing will ever change that. the vast majority of the population even in this game are highly vulnerable to others by subconscious or instinctive choice and they refuse to address the basal nature which drives them to be that way, instead preferring to assume it cannot be understood or controlled. we are powerless to change their view on the subject because they don't understand it and they don't want to."
1/11/2015,"any candidate in any election should answer every question asked to the fullest extent no matter how many times it has been repeated. this is because not everyone is the same as you and so may need the information in a different light to get the best understanding and as to maybe get a vote from a satisfied character. that is also how you are constructive even when faced with trolls as it can show that you can actually help someone and can be respectful, even if they are not. i have spent the time reading through this tread and it leads me to believe you have taken little time to look at other threads to understand how to approach those who ultimately vote in the election. your right about possibly being the underdog but you don't win people over by calling them lazy for asking you to repeat your material for which you have based this campaign on as they may not understand it in way way you first wrote it. in my eyes you are the lazy one. i have kept this post as constructive as my gritted teeth will allow it and will leave the post with one more idea that may or may not turn this train wreck of a campaign around. go through all of the questions asked and answer them like it was the first time hearing of them and do it with respect and just maybe you will win more votes. peace out, cc."
1/11/2015,"can you give me some of your thoughts on exactly what you want to do to change the csm. i'd really like to hear some specific details on this.i do worry about the way you reply to some peoples stuff, lets say you get on the csm, lets say you do put forward your ideas. now considering we post in several places, ccp's confluence and also in multiple places on these forums. some times people don't see stuff (i've had to re link stuff to people a fair few times), and your reply to someone from ccp is.do you really think thats going to help you get stuff sorted? knowing how to talk and communicate plays a huge part of what we do, and i'm sorry but you seem to really struggle on this."
1/11/2015,"thats the same attititude that makes 'her' hated in eve, not the ""i cant be bought off"" bit, but the ""look at my opinions and worship them, if you disagree you arent worth my time to acknowledge because im superior!"" schtick 'shes' been running for the last several yearsfact is simple, xenuria has ruined their reputation in eve on thsi character to the point that a german has better chances of being eleceted to the head of israeli government than xenuria does getting onto the csm"
1/11/2015,"what do you stand for? who do you represent?you say the csm needs to be remade or reorganized, but why exactly? i've yet to see a single other gaming company do something like this. it's unprecedented as far as i know and i would like to understand why on earth you think it's so bad as is. you've thrown around stats and made claims without anything to back them up. i, and i'd wager a majority of other players, will not vote for you based off of that alone. your answers to other people don't inspire confidence, if you can't answer a question you don't like, and instead attempt to dismiss the person asking, you have no business representing anyone."
1/11/2015,"i'm going to echo this until the mountains rattle. this kind of pie-in-the-sky approach to getting on the csm was all the rage a few years ago. a csm seat was looked upon as a arbitrary obligation that ccp had to fill and everyone with an axe to grind was simply led by that alone - a perceived chance to rage and if you didn't agree with the rage, you were somehow less ""enlightened""this is csm number 10. the relationship between ccp and the council has evolved and continues to improve. people see this and are conscious of the importance of having candidates who are communicative, focussed, and have the personal skills to wade through the unreasonable to reach the reasonable. as simon cowell once said, ""it's a no from me.""-1 eve community blogger - the eve editorial -"
1/11/2015,"at this point i am just going to outright ignore posts that are asking questions which i have already in this very thread answered specifically. these kinds of distraction tactics won't work here and the simple fact they are being attempted is indicative of my success as a candidate.with that said, if anybody has a question i haven't already answered repeatedly please post it. that's amusing even without the irony dripping from it. i communicate very effectively, it's not my fault if so many decide to post in this thread before even reading it. perhaps you should take some of your own advice and read the op (original post) of my thread.i never said my opinions were worthy of worship nor did i even imply they were worthy of praise of any kind. i don't think ideas should be worshiped or praised. i also am not faulting anybody for disagreeing with me. i am making a point to ignore them because they are using a very petty tactic to derail the thread. my platform is by far one of the most granular out of all the csm 10 platforms, yet a small group of people have seen fit to post before even so much as glancing at the first page."
1/11/2015,can i just throw it out there xenuria should get some form of best troll award because day in and day out we get pulled in to posting here and day in and day out he just blatantly trolls us with answers even a 12 year old would know not to put if you wanted to get anywhere with this. i applaud you and its been great fun watching you keep up the act..... wait... it's not an act? oh god.
1/11/2015,"so you're whole idea is that the csm needs reform. show me how the system is broken in the first place. then show me how your supposedly going to fix it.oh when i say show i mean give me proof, not by saying null blocs have power and they shouldn't. give me evidence to back your claims."
1/11/2015,"just did my interview. i was a bit nervous, and am looking forward to seeing how it came out. thanks guys! :)"
1/11/2015,"nashh was just the latest catalyst i can point to. don't agree to something just because you're sitting across a virtual table from tmc and cz then imply that doesn't matter because you don't see yourself as a ""journalist"". that's evidence to all of us that you're both willing and capable of the same kind of behavior on the csm.if this was strictly about #eve_nt, i wouldn't waste my time. eve community blogger - the eve editorial -"
1/11/2015,sweet i can confirm that i will be going to fanfest 2015 ! wooot #partytimeeeee
1/11/2015,"you say jump fatigue has ""had increadable effects"". what kind of mechanic would you envisage that might allow an individual pilot to move his capitals more freely that couldn't be used by hundreds of individual pilots (who all coincidentally belong to the same alliance or coalition) to take us right back to the bad old days of capital swarms crossing the map in a few minutes? jump fatigue ""adjusted to a minimal scale"" would be pointless - you're effectively arguing for the removal of the mechanic. perhaps the old days were fun for pl, but for everyone else the nullsec map was a festering pile of static, stagnant boredom by the time the travel nerf was introduced; in contrast, there are now 3 or 4 seperate wars active right now. i feel like you either don't understand what the jf mechanic was intended to achieve, or else you simply don't care. neither possibility is a compelling reason to vote for someone who is campaigning on a nullsec platform.if you can square this circle and think of a way to allow individuals to move while stopping fleets from doing the same, then you'll have more than earned a place in csm x. but i rather doubt you can. your own alliance mates are perhaps the most skilled in the game at optimising any edge cases - perhaps they can help you design a mechnic that even they can't exploit?"

1/11/2015,"offline pos towers:offline pos towers have been annoying for awhile, they can sit there, hold the moon, until someone is willing to bash through it. depending on the numbers you have (if you are alone or have some friends) it can still take a long time to kill even if its just a small (mediums and larges are even worse). i want there to be a change. i want to balance it, giving people a better option to remove the offline tower while not making it ""too easy."" this is eve, there needs to be a challenge. idea 1) if the pos tower is offline for 30 days or more, the shields go down (i.e. the offline tower no longer has any shield hitpoints) while there would still be bashing involved, we would be talking a fraction of the time required due to how much shield these offline towers have, leaving only the armor/hull to go through.idea 2) making the pos tower (thats been offline for 30 days or more) hackable, just like in the pve sites. this adds both an element that requires effort on part of the pilot to hack through the tower<U+FFFD>s systems, while adding content for any player that can hack.i am open to more ideas if you have any.vindicators:vindis are supposed to be jet black. they look cool that way and thats why i loved to fly them, now i don<U+FFFD>t fly vindis because of the changes. the icon makes it look like a glossy megathron navy issue and the ship just doesn't do anything for me anymore. i am not alone in these feelings, many others have expressed their views on this in a past reddit post dedicated to <U+FFFD>vindis are supposed to be black.<U+FFFD>burner missions:when they first came out i was really excited to try them, i had gone through multiple guides and was ready for adventure. fitting up different frigs to fly (each used for a different mission) i went around and fought each burner pirate at least three times. i really enjoyed doing them, almost lost my frig in one of the missions, and even got some faction loot in the very last one i did. i think these should be more available than they are now, not just a random pop up mission that you have to wait for to come. i am ready to hear ideas and concepts from people on how they would like these to be introduced more, i think they could be an incredibly fun <U+FFFD>career<U+FFFD> option for both new and older players if more missions were introduced, new levels of missions (more difficulty, etc). i want to take this fun new style of mission and expand it more.tech 2 frig logistics:just like there are onis, bassies, scimmies, etc. i think there should be t2 versions of the t1 frig logistics frigates. these t2 frig logis would go along with t2 frig comps such as assault frigs, electronic attack frigs, interceptors, etc. i have always enjoyed pvp involving ships under the size of destroyers and i think having these ships could make it more fun. i would love to hear what you all think about this.new corp logo<U+FFFD>s: i<U+FFFD>ve thought this for many years, however, never have i been vocal about this until now: there needs to be more corp logo options. i like the options there are now, i am not proposing to get rid of them, but to simply add more options in terms of symbols, backgrounds and colors. if it could be a combination of ccp artwork and player submitted artwork for symbols to be added, i think this would be a nice update to increase the option for diversity in corporate logos. i would like to hear what you all think about this.capitals in highsec:i have thought a lot about bringing capitals back into highsec for the sake of structure shooting, some people say only let dreads in, others say both carriers and dreads, i am open to both. i think this could add a dynamic to high sec that could add some fun. i also understand the concerns people would have (i.e. 16 triage archons on jita 4-4) so i want to hear everyone out on this to get their input.clothes:i wants hats. if you do not want the option to wear cool space hats then there must be something wrong with you. i want space hats, more options for clothing for both genders in terms of shirts, coats, pants, shoes, etc. i think this is an opportunity for collaboration between ccp and the player base. ishtars:there are so many things about ishtars that i am afraid to start going on about them because i may never stop. i want to hear what people have to say about balancing ishtars: reducing their speed, reducing their tank, changing ship bonuses, etc i want to hear what you have to say. fighting ishtars is just about the most annoying thing to fight and they need to be balanced. the most common phrase, with the proper tone <U+FFFD>oh<U+FFFD>..they are in ishtars.<U+FFFD>phoebe:i think, if at the least, its comical that at certain ccp employee worked on making the new jump changes in eve, left ccp to join another group and tried to introduce a type of fatigue in their game. this issue is polarized, some people love it, others hate it. i want to temper it, i don<U+FFFD>t see phoebe going away, but i think we can balance it better. i would like to hear what people have to say on this. i feel reducing timers and/or slightly increasing ranges for capitals would be appropriate. bring old rapid light missile launchers back:that pretty much says it. i am not fond of the 60 second reload timer. when its you in a solo caracal fighting a fleet of inties tackling you, and your launcher needs to sit dead in the water for 60 seconds you can end up dead in the water. me no like that. i would like to hear your thoughts on that. more to come in the future on current topics and new issues."

1/12/2015,"alexi drakenovic... bear in mind that what constitutes a ""legitimate reason"" is in the eye of the beholder. and no computer or mechanical system can reliably discern intent.what you consider to be a ""lol-worthy"" reason for putting a bounty on a person... i can consider it perfectly legitimate. the same is true in reverse.welcome to eve where there are no ""good guys."" only bad, not so bad, and ""holyshit, you did what??""this game literally exemplifies ""moral relativity.""it already exists. it's called ""dying.""if you were hoping for another way to remove the bounty... well... that would rather defeat the point of putting a bounty on someone, wouldn't it?example: ""hmmm... someone hates me enough to put a bounty on me. oh well, pay it off and i don't have to worry about it anymore.""as for the ""play the way you want to without being forced to do anything"" statements...unfortunately for you... every aspect of the game is forcing you do to certain things for or against players that you may or may not want to do... because that is how the game itself was designed to be (see: bring players into conflict with one another through mechanical freedom to perform any action they want even if it runs counter to other players' freedoms).examples:- in order to fly ships and fit them up you must...--- harvest, build, and move stuff yourself.--- pay someone else to do it for you.- in order to defend yourself you must...--- learn how the game mechanics work and pvp a bit.--- pay someone else to defend you.- in order to live in 0.0 space you must...--- learn to be really good at avoiding unfriendly encounters.--- be ""self sufficient"" (which may require either of the two above examples).--- join a 0.0 group so you have support.you have the freedom to do all of the above. you just don't have the freedom to ""opt out"" of it.edit: btw... i put a 10 million isk bounty on alexi... because his posts offend me (and yes, i consider this a legitimate reason for placing a bounty). oh no... this is exactly how the real world works. the only difference between eve and the real world is that in the real world most people are either too poor to afford a hitman, too scared of the repercussions, and/or the cost-benefit of killing a random person isn't worthwhile (for either the hitman or the bounty placer).eve is a dystopia. so none of the above restrictions apply here."
1/12/2015,"oh i understand this all, in fact you are right on all but one thing, and that is this part: it already exists. it's called ""dying.""if you were hoping for another way to remove the bounty... well... that would rather defeat the point of putting a bounty on someone, wouldn't it?example: ""hmmm... someone hates me enough to put a bounty on me. oh well, pay it off and i don't have to worry about it anymore.""and the it wouldn't be so easy, to pay off would cost a lot more isk then is on their bounty, say 3m to every 1m or something like that, so it could hurt the person with the bounties wallets, quite a lot in the case of some players i have seen, 1 guy i saw would have to trade a titan to remove his for example, and thanks for the bounty i guess.. ill make up some background to make it fit with my gaming experience, once i get to the pvp arena i can remove it in some valiant (stupid) attempt to take on something bigger then me, haha! till then i will make do, but anyways.i just wanted to bring it too someones attention is, all, thanks for the replies though and different views on the situation, cheers!fly safe!"
1/12/2015,"on the off chance that you didn't start this thread in order to troll and / or increase the bounty on your head, new eden *is* the pvp arena in this game."
1/12/2015,"no not to troll honestly, and i didn't expect people to up the bounty to be honest, i am just trying to make it work so it stays in role-play, and i know the whole game is pvp but i mean where i can leave station, make a jump, join a fleet, and then jump again and boom! fight time! that is what i meant."
1/12/2015,"joining up with an established faction warfare corporation and living in low-sec will be your best bet. learn from them and make friends (even with non-role players).look... i know you are big on the whole role play thing, you ""want to stick to your story,"" and that sometimes we who post on the forums can come down a little hard...... but the reality you have to understand that there are quite a few other players who don't really care about role play. this is doubly so when game mechanics are concerned as such changes affect everyone (role player or non role player alike).you also have to understand that things can get really messy (like... really, really messy) and not fit into any real category of ""lawful"" or ""unlawful"" (or any of the above).i guess what i'm trying to say here is this: don't take your role playing too seriously. there is going to be a point in time where you will have to make choices that may conflict with how you want to do things. and you can't expect the mechanical system to accommodate you on that basis alone.for example: in low-sec, you may be confronted by a player using caldari character... in a caldari corporation (npc or player)... in caldari space... and you will have to choose between shooting first (and taking a security penalty) or letting him/her make the first move which may result in your demise.said character has a positive security status and much higher faction standings with the caldari than you do.what do you do?here's another one;you are now part of the caldari militia in a player corporation. another caldari militia corporation has a problem with your corporation (for whatever reason). they declare war on your corp.you now have to shoot other players within your own militia in addition to your enemies (the gallente and minmatar).what do you do?(note: yes... this does happen... i was part of faction warfare for years and have more than once participated in such wars against my own militia... mostly due to issues that can be boiled down to ""only one ego may survive"")"
1/12/2015,"yeah i am big on it, but i won't let it ruin or limit me, thanks for the advice and that though, seriously, it is good to get different views and all that, and everything to do with the game as a learning curve like a mountain, so thank you!and yeah, i am trying to make as many friends in both pve and pvp parts of this game, as it makes it better when you have people to talk to, and yes, i do break character to talk to them, and not sound like and idiot, and i have other players online who do the role-play with me (corp mate mainly) and yeah.and i can see what you mean, however in that situation i could always turn it to role-play.. maybe it was the broker under the guise of someone else, that kinda thing, but i know it will not always work like that.. i just.. honestly my life sucks, all it is is work and home, and this is my only escape at the moment (live about 3 hours from work, so not much time for social stuff really) so i like to become someone different if that makes sense, and yes i know it is stupid, so troll away at that, but anyways.and what? your own militia can declare a war? on a friendly militia? that is stupid.. and it happens often?.. please say no? i am thinking i might just go null instead now.. thanks again!"
1/12/2015,"no worries. shoot me a mail if you need some advice about something in-game.you are one of us. that is why you are here.we have milk and cookies in the back... booze can be found in the room off that side of the hall (try not to spill)... and antimatter ammo is available at the counter for 18 isk a unit. i think the phrase, ""when it rains it pours"" is an apt description of the whole thing.inter-militia wars don't happen often... but when they do it is drama all around! and null-politics are even worse as egos are bigger, escape routes are fewer, and the consequences much larger in scope.like i said... in eve, things can get really messy (because ""freedom"" is a messy thing). in order to survive this you have to be just as flexible."
1/12/2015,this has been a problem since day 0 of the new bounty system that's suppose to encourage bounty hunting and keep people from using their alts to kill a pod and claim their billions in bounty
1/12/2015,"there are no innocent players in eve. if someone wishes to place a bounty upon another player, it's their choice and their reason alone that matters.as ccp eterne once said.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
1/12/2015,"i have to agree with those that are urging ccp to approach this topic carefully. i fear that if we're given a system that doesn't have interesting and dynamic gameplay as well as a long life span, we're going to see some serious negative fallout that will stay with us for quite a while.instead, i urge ccp to carefully consider each component and gather necessary feedback on the changes to ensure that players are given a system that we'll enjoy playing with far into the future, one that's modular, and most importantly, one that's fun and engaging."
1/12/2015,"and most importantly, one that doesn't make me literally wish i was having a root canal instead. this thread has degenerated to the point it's become like two bald men fighting over a comb. -- doc fury"
1/12/2015,"""rushed and incomplete"" was what got us the dominion sov system. i'm sure that ccp are keenly aware that a new sov system is urgently required. in fact i know they are."
1/12/2015,this thread is exactly why i stated in my cap stable interview that the greatest challenge csm 10 will have is making sure that ccp's execution is measured and thought-out instead of botched due to high player expectations and pressure.

1/12/2015,"1) power of voting blocks and coalitions getting a candidate in purely on associate with the group. applies to all of null and some wh alliances, not just grrr goons.2) can't vote against all the mushrooms that pop up in the garden.3) see next section.4) yes, motd in local chat, etc, high sec needs to even know what csm is. number of people i have spoken to and have never heard of the csm, who have been playing for years is staggering.5) missed the fact i want more people to mark the ballots, even if it is to abstain. make sure we are reaching people and see what types of players we reach. bit of market research.6) bubble rorquals, absorb modules, anti afk-cloaking just to name what is in this very thread are aimed at helping null sec. people are stuck on the idea that i am some high sec player.7) summary, see next section. that was a strange post. on one hand shooting me down on the other wishing me luck and thanking me for running. buttering both sides of the toast? it seems you guys think i am shooting eve down, being negative about it, how about looking at it from this perspective: i think eve is a fantastic game the fixes, improvements and such that i am campaiging for are relatively small things in order to take what i feel is excellent toward perfection!"
1/12/2015,your handwaving abilities are extremely impressive. it will be interesting to watch the progress of your campaign.
1/12/2015,csmx interview
1/12/2015,i rest my case.
1/12/2015,after hearing that podcast interview... hahaha no way
1/12/2015,bunch of information he can't put sources to..
1/12/2015,clearly members of oe are not my target audience. recent api leaks and internal drama aside...
1/12/2015,"perhaps i can provide an example of an answer. i will take the antagonist position in the debate and attempt to demonstrate that the csm is good and does not have any drawbacks. i am debating against xenuria's claims, as an example of how to do a proper demonstration of a point. my specific point will be to suggest that the voting system that is used by the csm negates political treachery rather than facilitates it.my first attempt to persuade my audience will come in the form of a brief explanation of the voting system:the council of stellar management in eve online uses the single transferable vote (stv) system to distribute votes to the candidates. in this system, each voter selects several candidates and ranks them in order of choice, from 1 (most important) and down. each player only gets to use one vote but when the votes are tallied, a player's vote only counts toward a winning candidate. their vote will be automatically transferred to a candidate ranked lower in their list as needed to ensure their vote counts.this prevents the old ""go ahead, throw away your vote!"" mentality from preventing tertiary parties from getting votes. should the voters be interested in a new candidate, they can freely rank the candidate on their list without giving up the chance to vote on the lesser of two evils should it become the only option.my second attempt to persuade my audience will come in the form of examples in which the system has demonstrated itself:the single transferable vote system has seen real-world use in several countries, including the uk, the republic of ireland, australia, new zealand, india, pakistan, and more recently, in iceland. these nations have seen a staggering change in politics with the introduction of stv, with fresh new candidates cycling in and pushing out the old and unwanted parties, and with politicians learning that they must address the concerns of their voters, since merely defaming the competition is no longer a successful method of collecting votes.this contrasts starkly with two-party systems in nations not using stv, such as the usa or canada. these countries see a wide variety of new and interesting candidacies die quickly since everyone is afraid to vote for anyone but one of the two primary candidates. it fuels hatred and animosity between supporters of either party, while all of the voters begin to feel trapped and powerless to effect change in their failing economy.note how i have made separations and highlights in my post to make it easier to read and digest. it is also clear and direct. not everyone will understand it or believe it, but it both states my position in the debate and provides others with my reasoning for my position. this is a reasonable starting point but i still need to be prepared to answer questions asked about my position, even if i have answered them previously. if they didn't understand it the first time, either i have not described it in a way they understand, or i have hidden it too deeply in my rant and they have failed to locate it.what i suggest for you, xenuria, is to write up a campaign letter similar to mine, only in reverse. state clearly what specific problems you see with the system, then give examples that suggest your position is correct. now i realize you have stated that the voting system caters to nullblocs and have used the prevalence of goonswarm candidates as a supporting example, but you have not yet presented this in a clear and concise manner. try writing it in the format i used above, or something similar and equally clear.then you are strongly recommended to finish with an explanation of how you intend to solve the problem. if voters are to take you seriously as a candidate, they need to know that you not only agree with them but that you are going to support them. recognizing the problem is not enough by itself. if you do not yet have a functional solution, perhaps your answer can be that once elected, you intend to present your evidence of corruption first-hand to the candidates of the csm and work closely with them to explore other possibilities, pushing minor changes as they are discovered to gradually reform the system.ultimately you need to convince your potential voters that if you won a seat on the csm, your presence there would have a positive impact on eve."
1/12/2015,my platform does not rest solely in vote reform. i think where people are getting confused is they think the vote system is the only thing i wish to change. if they bothered to read the op they would know it's more that that. i have consulted with my peers and the general consensus is that most of these posters are trolling and trying to bait an argument. as a tactic it works well in spoken debates but when the answers are in text the tactic falls apart. i appreciate you trying to help but i assure you that i don't need any in this context. the people who actually care to know my stances can read them.
1/12/2015,you're too busy assuming these people are trolling and not putting enough time and energy into listening to them. i don't think you read my post very carefully. i mentioned the voting system as an example but my real point was that you haven't formulated your points in a way that makes them easy for people to understand and respond to. your entire stance on your issues are difficult to decipher as even the issues you present are unclear.
1/12/2015,you haven't exactly endeared yourself to the eve community. that cap stable interview was awkward to borderline hostile. might have something to do with it. just too much baggage.
1/12/2015,i am listening to your podcast right now and your talking about purchasing accounts for votes do you have proof about that? can you get a link to show your evidence?also since this game is an mmo and a sandbox should we not be able to pay people to vote for us? why should we not be allowed to do that?when you talk about connectivity what would you do to improve that?yeah dotlan wow such an answer.so you are talking about eve players and non eve players in an example. such a great way to make us understand.red herring emasculated with my presencecan we get proof of your work so we know you are not talking outta your but?also you just sound like your all grr goons and about taking us down.
1/12/2015,"it's not my fault he didn't bother to do any research before interviewing me. he confused me with lex arson and a few other people. i am sorry but i am afraid i cannot make my stances any simpler than they already are.most if not all of my evidence has already been cited. ccp is where i got my statistical data and the csm whitepaper is where i got the information about paying for votes. i made a point to say in that segment that the mittani is exceptionally gifted but also controversial. i think that's a fair statement and i am standing by it. i don't have the ""grrr goons"" mentality you are attempting to label me with. some of the people that originally got me into eve are goons. just because i am at war with the cfc or taking sov from them doesn't mean i am unable to appreciate their legitimacy as a player entity."
1/12/2015,"dear mr bangboom, um... i had to actually research to find out what you meant.i actually got that from some guy that posted containers around in space... his name was maximilian something (rota..sky?). anyway he had the word ""free"" in there, and i sort of changed it.where did you get your catchphrase from?ah. i don't think you are right there. and i don't think i want total safety... but well. feel free to read some of the posts in this thread, and get yourself up to date on what we have been talking about... if you are really interested."

1/12/2015,"the jump fatigue effect has been great however i think the mechanic itself is a bit harsh cause it flows over into other activities then for the individual pilot. i would make it so that your time between jumps is long (10mins or so). through this you don't have any overflow of fatigue and it will still take a long time for a capital to move around.wars didn't happen purely because of jump fatigue (there were wars brewing before the changes were announced which actually were canceled by many alliances). wars happen because the cards were shuffled allowing pilots to play again, again the effect was great it just needs some fine tuning, take out parts and put in new ones.also i liked what you said here:"
1/12/2015,"i have several questions.1) where do you get the 10 mins from for jump timer, any research done or just a number you pulled out your arse?2) on justforcrits you were asked ""if you weren<U+FFFD>t running, but you could singlehandedly ensure that any other person in eve would be elected to csm, who would you pick and why.""you listed 1) corebloodbrothers2) tora bushido3) manfred sideous4) xander phoena5) sion kumitomo6) endieyou said because these people all have proven themselves to understand, the game and they are nice dudes to hang with!so part a) do you really think all these people understand the game be honest? please justify your answerb) do you think you should voting people on cos ""they are nice dudes to hang with!"" is a valid reason to be on the csm"
1/12/2015,"1) it was based on the following: siege cycle is 5 mins - doomday is 10mins cooldown. 2) a = i have spoked with all players, some even in rl and yes they gave me the feeling that they would be successful!b = that was a personal statement and in general i like to vote on somebody who is actually a nice guy"
1/12/2015,"updated second post with another possible idea:#13 sbu'smake them single use, so once you drop them, they are dropped. this would remove the defensive sbu tactic cause you would basically make your own system vulnerable. this would stimulate multiple things such as: more objective based fights, sbu market will go up, pi market will go up.this means more fights, more isk for pilots!onces sov drops all sbu's will be either blown up automaticly or turned offline (easy to destroy)!"
1/12/2015,i rather think that we're all hoping for a sov system rework sufficiently radical that sbus no longer exist. but this would be a good interim patch.
1/12/2015,"yes to everything except:jump fatigue/ranges are great. we went from a completely polarized nullsec to the current situation that has us with several groups all competing for dominance. even the lowsec groups are more bold with sub caps now that they don't have to worry about being dropped on with supers every time.mixed feeling on the rapid lights. their dps is great as is their damage application. i like their niche set up.no to caps in highsec. highsec should be kept unique no?lastly, we need more sun glasses."
1/12/2015,if we can agree on more space sun glasses i am pretty sure we can work through anything )))
1/12/2015,i was promised a shrine on your website for committing my support to this thread and you have yet to deliver. if you cannot produce a simple shrine how can you possibly be trusted on crucial issues like making vindicators black again?
1/12/2015,living in lowsec my whole eve career and i couldn't disagree more with you. (the bolded part)
1/12/2015,i should clarify. lowsec groups are more bold because 0.0 powers don't drop caps on them left and right. but lowsec groups themselves are using caps more often now.
1/12/2015,well hello there!my name is lanctharus onzo and i an one of the co-host and writers of the cap stable podcast.in early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10.here is our announcement:
1/12/2015,"and like i said before. i disagree. the same amount of capital kills are happening as pre-pheobe. 0.0 entities were the smaller groups ""batphone"" or ""bail out"" rite 911 call. now they (the smaller lowsec groups) can do nothing to use caps to combat the big lowsec entities now such as tishu, oe, snuff, sc ect... where as in the past they could have called someone to help balance the field out."
1/12/2015,balancing out lowsec fights by pulling in 0.0 powers. hmmm....
1/12/2015,1# issue for this campaign:death 2 ishtars
1/12/2015,"something needs change. most groups wont use capitals in our area because ""rnest might drop us"". which if they had the ability to counter us (wider jump range / bringing friends) they might actually field something."
1/12/2015,"you mention that you can't go to summits (due to your dog), however you did attend the last summer summit. at the summits alot of extra talking, chatting, sorting issues happens outside the meetings themselves (down the pub). do you think you being there had a negative affect since people had to be more careful on what they spoke about, since you arent under nda?"
1/12/2015,"june and i live in the same city and are close irl, so when she let me know she was stopping off in iceland on her way to europe for a business trip, i wanted to hang out with her. i asked if i could invite her and was given the all-clear, so i did. if that was a problem, my apologies; it didn't seem to be at the time (and like i said i checked). while she was in iceland and later in europe, her dog had a series of very bad seizures. it was miserable, the phone calls were miserable, nobody slept very long, and nobody wants to go through that again. so, no summits.which is a bit of a shame, as if elected, she'll make a great csm-- she and i have talked a lot about eve, the metagame, etc, and for a while lead sound together. we've shaped each other's perspective on a number of things. i wholeheartedly endorse her, and hope to spend the next year listening to the (nda-sanitized) stories of csm awesomeness."
1/12/2015,"last august, i was in iceland as a stopover on a previously scheduled business trip to europe that happened to coincide with the summer summit. i was in fact invited by ali aras with ccp leeloo's permission to come socialize at the pub while i was in town, yes. anyone could have been at the pub eavesdropping, so people should have had to watch what they said anyways. rule 0 of infosec is that you never know who is listening. to be quite honest, i'd rather that people in fact practice proper infosec, so the fact that i was overtly there and people were aware i was non-ndaed should have just made people follow good practices anyways and should not have negatively affected things. plenty of non-nda social talk happened without any problems.as far as the future goes, unfortunately my dog had a rather bad seizure while i was in europe, which makes it extremely unlikely that i'll ever be able to take an international trip again as long as my dog is still alive :(. at the time, i hoped that the trip would go smoothly so i could continue traveling in the future, but it didn't. my spouse did not enjoy making the 2am panicked phonecall to me, and i did not enjoy being many thousand miles away and unable to do anything to help."
1/12/2015,"hello gorski,it's been awhile! i wanted to find out when you wanted to schedule your csmx interview?executive editor, csm watch || writer, co-host of the cap stable podcast || twitter: @lanctharus"
1/12/2015,are you a official candidate of pl? other thank your weekly blog and the imput stuff what else have you done this year for the csm?
1/12/2015,"so i had a chat with people today about some random things. warp core stabilizers should be disabled in faction warfare complexes. there should also be some sort of standings loss mechanic for repeated warping out. there's nothing wrong with warping out when a ten man gang lands on your plex, it would take a fool to try and fight that, but never fighting and/or always running should be penalized. the lp rightfully belongs in the hands of people that generate lossmails, rather than devalued by afk farming. risk/reward here is pretty broken, and its a shame as fw is one of the great ways into the game. syndicate is a unique place. its geography makes it viable as one of the only npc null havens for newer, adventurous groups that do not want to deal with lowsec gate and station mechanics, as it is not entirely a logistical nightmare to live in. however, there is no real stable source of income to fuel those groups now, especially not compared to other npc null places. the recent changes to the lp store are a step in the right direction. edge implants are worthless, and replacing them with a +% hull hp set would be very interesting for niche hull tanked fits and freighter pilots - these would both be in demand and interesting, as well as be thematically compatible with the intaki syndicate. perhaps even an industrial that can haul combat boosters through high sec and not be pulled over by the faction police. ded sites were perhaps the only accessible income, and those are rapidly becoming devalued by the changes to escalations in sov null. if veterans and new players alike had any sustainable, bottom up income in syndicate, it could hum with activity. standings are a terrible trap currently. once a character has committed to a side in faction warfare or done one too many mission, grinding them back up is worse than having one's teeth pulled then gargling sulfur - an anachronism from games of decades' past. tags to fix standings should be streamlined the same way security status tags were, and the belt rats (or other mechanic) that give the tags should be npc null exclusive, giving them another unique export."
1/12/2015,"kudos to vic jefferson...this is one of the better candidate threads that i've read. i enjoy the measured and practical tone to your proposals and that you address both macro topics and ""small things"" like actual ship balance. few questions:1) any recommendations on how to make missile systems (particularly anything larger than lms) more competitive in pvp? 2) your thoughts on the recent balance activity with recon ships (i.e. does this actually help all the recons?) and the major nerf of fighter & fighter-bombers? 3) what are primary ways you'll want to engage the community if elected, particularly those outside your specific alliance? do you think it's helpful or necessary to open your aperture up beyond your alliance for feedback?4) what separates you from the other large bloc nul candidates out there?good luck with the election. biomassed - dust & eve podcast"
1/12/2015,"1)balancing the larger missile systems is going to be tricky right now. a good deal of the problem is that the larger missiles sort of depend on larger, slower things being out there. another part of the problem is drones (or their platforms) are just too good now as well - application wise and damage wise getting something to compete with them is going to be hard. basically its hard to judge exactly what needs fixing about them given the environment they exist in currently - this would be a much easier call in a different meta. 2)recons are hard to balance. you do not want them to be too tanky, but you also do not want to have them be so frail as to be useless in a larger fight. getting those numbers just right is hard given how many things can modulate hp. t3s will still be king of real fleet fights. i do not think this changes them all that much, more capacitor is good though. i view the fighter changes as more a preventative move against a potential exploit than a change; off-grid links and off-grid assist are both things that sort of do not make sense to me.3)i primarily view myself as non-partisan here with regards to alliance. its a label and lots of people definitely do not look beyond it, echoing 'grr goons'. i am running as a player, nothing more. i will maintain an active presence on the relevant forms and am contactable in game. 4)i am primarily concerned with empowering new players, small groups, and content creation everywhere in new eden. i do not speak for large alliances, or for their needs exclusively. i am not officially endorsed in any way. you are as likely to find me in npc null or low sec as you are in sov null, if not more."
1/12/2015,"thanks for the responses, vic. again, good luck in the election and i hope you do well. biomassed - dust & eve podcast"
1/12/2015,"your theme is ""chaos and hilarity,"" but your main concern seems to be min/maxers who reduce everything to a handful of optimized numbers and then complain that they're not having any fun. that's their problem, not anyone else's.your great example, barleguet, already happened. it happened before the latest round of buffs to lowsec, if memory serves. chaos and hilarity are already available to anyone who wants them. the people who are running high-sec incursions instead of living in wormholes would rather run high-sec incursions than live in wormholes. they might not want to admit that to themselves, because it's ~so hardcore~ to live in a c6 (or sov null, for that matter), but there they are. when i lived in w-space, i actually lived there, because i wanted to. i took an income hit relative to running l4s in high sec, but that was worth the trade of not having to run l4s in high sec. i would rather throw rl money at plex than do that, especially if i'm by myself.that said, i don't disagree with the idea that especially npc null-sec needs some love. the main problem there is that simply buffing rewards won't do: null-sec anomalies are already the largest isk faucet in the game, by a comfortable margin, so bumping up the bounties just makes the biggest single faucet even bigger. not to mention that, because the bounties are fixed amounts, the rewards are divided by the number of participants, and so you have lots of solo anomaly runners and very little teamwork. (it didn't stop us from running anomalies in pvp fleets, but ymmv.)so the question of how to restructure the rewards in nullsec is an interesting one. if you look at the current model:1) it penalizes group play;2) it's a giant isk faucet;3) nearly all the rewards are teleported magically into the player's wallet, so interaction with other players in the arenas of the market and logistics are limited to the occasional shiny drop;4) it's the same old thing, over and over and over again;5) unlike the l5 agents in barleguet, they don't scale with population.so, given those (and feel free to dispute them, i'm open to correction), how would you approach the problem of structuring rewards in null-sec?"
1/12/2015,"sometimes it is the ratio of carrot to stick that makes all the difference. the classic prisoner's dilemma is such an iconic conundrum because people are so naturally inclined to hedge their bets. generally i do not know much about wh space (that's where the scary people live!), but everything i hear about buffing lower class whs such that they are more profitable seems like an excellent idea. more carrots where they belong. most of my theoretical changes to npc null are isk neutral or close to; missions remove isk via lp and tags would add value, not isk. anomalies don't generate that much of the income in npc null as they are quite limited and dangerous. i would much rather add desirable items to npc null and keep it very differentiated from sov null. when i first started the game, scoring a vindicator bpc could keep you stocked on ships for a while; now not so much. i would be happier keeping the liquid isk faucet in sov space, and just adding commodities to npc null to give them something unique, without homogenizing them with sov null - every security band ideally has its own unique ways to contribute to the overall economy. unique spawns or unique sites, basically anything in space that produces an item that someone wants.anomalies, though incredibly dry, do produce emergent content. the group play here is intel and defense fleets. that's not saying they are fine as is, or do not need adjustments, but i'm not sure what those would be. the ess in its current incarnation has an issue with being guarded by rats, but i don't think this is the real issue with them. rather the issue is that ratting is so sprawled across so many systems. each system can only support a few ratters before it becomes overcrowded, thus you never really have a critical mass of people that want to actively defend it, and avoidance or not anchoring it becomes the dominant, boring strategy. perhaps if they were constellation wide or had some more mechanics to actually get both interested parties on the same grid like fw does, or we had fewer systems that each in turn could support more ratters, they would be more useful. ships are blowing up in and around anomalies, so at least they have that going for them over l4s.i do hear most of your concerns about null anomalies. your points one and four apply to equally to missioning as much as they do anomalies, so those are more an issue with most forms of pve rather than anomaly specific. the ess tries to make the rewards more commodity based, but doesn't quite do the job. hundreds, probably thousands of man hours have probably been spent thinking about how to fix null-sec's bottom up income - i don't have an answer either. when you have people wtih alts in hi sec to make money for their low and null-sec fun having, you do realize there is a bit of a problem though."

1/12/2015,well hello there!my name is lanctharus onzo and i an one of the co-host and writers of the cap stable podcast.in early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10.here is our announcement:

1/12/2015,"you could probably just say ""yes"" or ""no"" faster than it takes you to type all that out."
1/12/2015,i have clearly stated yes i would like to see some balance to the mechanic. yes.
1/12/2015,well hello there!my name is lanctharus onzo and i an one of the co-host and writers of the cap stable podcast.in early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10.here is our announcement:
1/13/2015,"i too listened to that interview. i have a couple of questions:1) you seem to not understand stv (or as you call it, svt). listing a candidate at the bottom of your ballot *never* hurts that candidate, it can only (possibly) help them. if you want to reform the voting system, you ought to at least understand it. you never said which vote counting system you would prefer, can you please explain which one you would choose and why?2) you claim to be a consultant irl, but a simple google search of your real name (from previous elections), turns up your linked-in page which claims you are currently employed as a security officer at mcroberts protective agency. is that incorrect? what sort of consulting work do you do (other than the work you described as ""looking at things"" in the interview)?(a note to isd, i know forum rules usually prohibit posting of personal information, but in this case the information was provided by xenuria during his previous csm campaigns)3) what *specific* changes to the white paper would you make. you mentioned prohibiting vote buying. how would this be enforced? why shouldn't people be able to buy votes in a game where one can buy loyalty (supposedly)?csm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate @two_step_eve on twitter my blog"
1/13/2015,"very good questions!1. yes i did mess that up and i apologize. i do prefer stv too the previous system, i do not however have the requisite mathematical knowledge to concoct a superior system.2.yes, i am still an employee and my sora is still valid. if you do a search of their company site you will see they provide all sorts of security consulting. most of my consulting these days is more in the human service sector than the security sector. i find fulfillment in helping people. 3. i would advocate for the prohibition of vote buying, and candidate misrepresentation. for example, sion's thread states that his alliance has a long history of being new player friendly. this may lead new players with no knowledge of goonswarm to vote for him under the pretense that he represents their interests. on whyvote buying should not be allowed unless it becomes very easy to determine if the votes being bought are actual players and not just massive farms of unused accounts. how to go about enforcing these things is something far more complicated than the original concept. much of the same systems used to detect bots and rmt would be very effective at alerting ccp when a single ip or payment info is used to buy a massive amount of accounts. again when those same accounts never undock or do anything other than activate plex, this would also be flagged. enforcing the ethics portion is a bit harder to tie down because of the impracticality of fact checking what candidates say. i would at the minimum want the recent policy changes regarding impersonation to stretch to the csm."
1/13/2015,"what a politician says, and what its interpreted at the individual voter level, are separate things. all politicians though stand for their own interests, thats whats wrong with politicians.as for your comment on goonswarm, i can honestly say, as a avid supporter of almost everything anti-goon, that until bni shows up, they were the best place in nullsec for noobs, lots of teaching/leading, low skill point barrier for entry, generally flew in cheap replaceable ships. they were and are new player friendly. now if a newbie thinks that means goonswarm would advocate for giving every noobie a free skill-unrequired supercarrier for havign a steam version of eve or something, thats entirely the fault of the voter, not the candidate.in fact, most of the issues you and everyone else have ever had with the csm system isnt with the system itself, its with the voters, and youll run into the same issue regardless of what system you use to ""correct it"", short of ccp arbitrarily replacing and refusing candidates ""just because"" and ""for balance in representation we wont clarify"", which isnt really voting at all, its more the american system where everybody votes, then those votes are thrown in a furnace and an electoral college makes the decisions. (which would be bad for eve)"
1/13/2015,"i listened to your interview and i want to mirror another poster in that your comments are borderline hostile and completely grrr goon. i thought some of your comments were down right insulting to some candidates, you basically said that they were cronies of large null sec (usually goon) alliances even though they don't represent them publicly or represent their play style. you didn't know xander phoena's name and while not a big deal he is the person you wanted to work with, if nothing else it made you seem unprepared as did not knowing how the voting system works. listening to just one of the other podcasts would have given you an insight into what was going to be asked and it seems that you didn't even do that.i have only been around since 2012 so i don't have the experience of the other csm elections but i have been very happy with my votes. people i chose have won and some have lost and i have never felt like the process was rigged or bought so when you say those kinds of things it doesn't hit home for me because i see it differently. with few exceptions the csm has seemed to do what i want them to do and that is help ccp move the game forward. ccp has tried sending out notifications about the csm elections and they have tried not sending them out and both times they have been called out for doing it incorrectly. the problem isn't ccp or the csm, it is the players. some don't care, others don't know and we can't force knowledge on them and the last group is us, the people who do know, care and are involved. we vote and your interview and almost all your posts before mine have been, well, rude. your campaign seems to be selfish and worst of all you want to assume things about the csm, ccp and players that i honestly don't think is a problem or issue. your comments on the podcast were divisive, rude, ill informed and in my opinion factually incorrect. you have had many problems (just by hearing you talk) with groups, players and csm members and i am forced to believe that wouldn't change if you were elected. i am looking for a person who is willing to work with others, get along with others and represent players in a way that changes the game for the good.yesterday's weirdness is tomorrow's reason why. hunter s. thompson"

1/13/2015,just throwing this in here for people who don't fancy working through the various calculations on how an stv system works.
1/13/2015,"xenuria, you say people bought votes or paid for plex to make accounts to vote rig. do you realise how utterly ludicrous that sounds? lets do some math and assume that for me to get into the csm i need 9000 votes. if we assume plex is 900m isk, for me to get 9000 votes i'd need to spend 8,100,000,000,000 isk on plex to go with that theory. even if we take plex (or 30 day time codes) prices from several years ago at 450m a pop, that is still a rather large sum. the only people that could likely afford that sort of isk are also the sort of people that can send out a jabber ping asking their coalition to vote for them and not have to resort to buying accounts to vote for themselves. i don't think it's even worth discussing the amount of time it would take to sign up, sign in and vote on even 100 accounts let alone 9k. ok, so that idea is pretty preposterous. how about we use real money to buy 9000 plex. at today's prices that's just shy of 180,000 usd. ok, so that idea is pretty silly as well. even if we just assume to get 1000 votes from these methods the numbers and effort is quite ridiculous. yes, ccp said that in one instance that there was a mention of people using isk to buy votes however that was pretty public when the player claimed they'd do it and i don't believe they ever followed through with it and it was back in 2011."
1/13/2015,"so if i put you in a room with a load of ""smug socially validated eve players"" and then moved you to a room with normal people, what would happen?a: nothing, you simply manage to alienate yourself and offend every single social group in eve, evidenced by your recent appearance on capstable.does your mere presence emasculate people? you must be in the wrong job?how would you regard your comments of last year when you called an employee of ccp games ""f**ktarded stupid""? are you ready to quit flinging mud at people you dont like or don't agree with?"
1/13/2015,"i explained in the interview that (former ccp) dolan was not taking the process seriously. he banned me from participating because he claimed i did damage to ccp servers in a cyber attack. when asked for proof he cited a post on 4chan. ""the stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood.only a fool would take anything posted here as fact."" -4chan disclaimeri recommend you do some research before mincing contexts and content like they were some kind of ~distraction milkshake~. in most other games the impracticality of a caper or play is a deterrent, in eve it's a challenge. you have to understand that people in eve throw money around in some of the most irresponsible ways imaginable. no fit too shiney, no election too costly."
1/13/2015,"the csm voting should not be letting 2 of the same corp or allinace be members of , which is not fair to be having same people in same corp and most of it is cfc think the csm is bad idea"
1/13/2015,"kinda fixed the csm voting as we allready know who will win even before it is casted as goons all vote for them self and cfc would also vote for them self,"
1/13/2015,"the csm vote isn't fixed. asking your alliance to vote for you is not fixing it, it's simply asking your party members to vote for you. your saying that it's fixed if all tory or republican party members vote for the tory or republican party? i don't think you have a true grasp on reality if you seriously think anyone on the csm, past or present actually paid either isk or real money to get onto it. it's just not that important, pays off well enough or can't be gained in other ways like pre-populated polls (in years past) or a simple jabber ping saying please vote for this list, in this order. or possibly you don't understand communities and what binds them means they don't have to buy votes. its the gevlon goblins of this world that would have to resort to paying or those candidates without an alliance behind them who can't rely on a free backing. if you think that a goon or pl candidate had to pay when they have a free source of willing voters, enough to get them in without a worry, you're barking up the wrong tree."
1/13/2015,why don't you run for csm i'd vote for you over xenuria anytime. along with my massed accounts that i obviously buy.

1/13/2015,thank you for your post. it got my blood up sufficiently to ensure i get off my lazy arse and cast a vote for the first time.and that vote will be going to mike.
1/13/2015,"i was drawn to eve because it was described by a gamer colleague as a rich virtual universe where you had a lot of options as a player. if someone had described it as a pvp spaceship game i would not have bothered to even download the client and just kept trying to get better at counter-strike.regarding the social aspect of the game , i'm wondering if something more can be done to encourage players while they are still going through the tutorial phase (and maybe as part of the tutorial) to engage with other players in their faction by fleeting up and running a mission together or doing pvp in destroyers against a similar fleet from another faction (amarr vs minmitar , caldari vs gallente) . don't torch me for bringing up wow, but something like those capture-the-flag missions where you join a room with other random players to form a team could work quite well.the other problem i gather new players in highsec face is how to deal with wardecs. well meaning corp or alliance heads will often direct their members to avoid the enemy in order to not provide kills. while this is a rational approach , in effect the message going out to new players is ""don't fight. don't mission. don't mine. don't haul. get killed and i'll kick you out."" so basically you've spent some money to play a game and you're being told to not play. even mid-sized corps and alliances are not averse to giving out these directives. now of course , some will say the player should just join a big alliance capable of defending itself, but is that where we want players ending up by default? these large entities also have their own rules and requirements and are not for everyone. some players will figure out the best way to keep playing and avoid wardecs is to go back into the npc corp, but that offers up a socially sterile experience at best unless you have other contacts in-game. maybe limiting the number of wardecs a small corp can be subjected to in a 30 day period combined with making it more costly to wardec might allow small corps to survive and grow. it is sometimes not the actual wardec itself but the fear it will be extended or that another wardec will come along immediately after that is the problem for the small corp and its members."
1/13/2015,sabriz has ideas that are both mostly reasonable and not based on obvious ulterior motives. people in my alliance who don't vote for sabriz will be flogged then shot.

1/13/2015,sugar works hard and puts the effort in to make this game better for us. she has my votes!
1/13/2015,"endie,1. in nc's recent alliance update, vince said that ""everyone in nc should be working towards owning an sc or titan."" for the major coalitions, it seems like supers have gone from a rare, valuable strategic asset to a mandatory piece of equipment. do you think this super proliferation is a healthy step in an aging nullsec, or do you think it will stagnate nullsec and make it nigh-impossible to break their fleets and put a dent in the old superpowers' resources?2. if goonswarm was started today instead of 8 years ago, would they still be able to establish themselves as one of the major nullsec superpowers? or would they have been repeatedly crushed by the older nullsec coalitions? what does this say about the current state of nullsec compared to 3-5 years after the game launched?3. do you think more nullsec systems should be added to the game? if so, should they follow the same mechanics as the rest of nullsec, or should they have different mechanics to encourage occupancy by different/younger coalitions?"
1/13/2015,"what would a more balkanised eve mean for the cfc? does not the existence of the cfc and the ""other"" big bloc prevent a more balkanised eve? i guess what i mean is that any changes to the game to bring about a more balkanised eve must mean breaking the power of coalitions.how does this sit with you as a senior goon, and what do you think can be done to balkanise nullsec?"
1/13/2015,"he's already addressed these in his articles on sov.tl;dr: the giant coalitions exist because it's too easy to take sov; sheer firepower at specific timers is the biggest determining factor in sov, so a few dozen people with supers/t3s could take sov from hundreds of players that don't have similar resources without breaking a sweat. hence everyone has to band into coalitions with equal firepower just to survive. remake sov so it's persistence, not firepower, that determines who controls sov, so that a group of 100-200 newbros can force nc to put time & dedication into taking a single system from them (rather than steamrolling them with a dozen supers whenever their reinforcement timers pop), and the gigantic coalitions will no longer be necessary to survive. once giant coalitions are no longer necessary, they'll fracture because it's a pain in the ass to keep 12,000 people cooperating with each other."
1/13/2015,"while thinking about things to ask you i thought about more tools for npsi communities and how they could also help other types of groups as well. i thought of a tool with the same structure as a corp but for a profession or hobby that you do in game with people that aren't necessarily in your own corp. you could join it just like a corp, but perhaps it's a little more limited in its benefits so it's not just a repetition of corporations we have today. my thoughts were a chat channel, group bookmarks, some roles such as comm officer, and maybe station offices. with those tools people that fly npsi, suicide gank, haul, incursions etc. could enjoy the ability to stay in their main pvp/pve/whatever else corp and also be connected with those that they do their other part time hobbies with in a more structured and useful way. i feel like this is exactly or close to what you are suggesting, but i wanted to hear more on it from you if possible. thanks!"
1/13/2015,"i flew under manny during the halloween war, this man knows his ****. +1 from all of my accounts good sir!as for a question, i'll get back to you when i have one worth asking"

1/13/2015,i'd vote for him
1/13/2015,"you said you would be pushing for more clothes, but didn't specify what sort of styles. currently i feel that, especially in terms of colours, the vast majority of clothing options lack extravagance, as someone who expresses themselves through their clothes this makes me very sad indeed.what are your thoughts on introducing clothes that vary greatly in both style and colour? we're all immortal space gods, surely we should be able to wear neon-rainbow polka-dot bell-bottoms, for example."
1/13/2015,"you do understand, that you cant have force projection effectively nerfed and have regions like drones and your example of period basis easily accessible, at least not without significant modifications to the geography of the eve map which could create some serious complications. omist may actually be a better example, as you can get to period basis via jf via npc null, its kinda of ugly but possible. omist, tenal much of the drone regions, is basically impossible to get to without being blue to the individuals up the pipe form you. just something for you to think about. from your original op, you seem to suggest that we are still living in an age of supercaps online, even with force projection nerfs and s.carriers significantly limited drone bays / drone selection options. what do you see supercarriers positions being in the games meta? i personally think that other than being hard to kill supercarriers by in large are pretty well balanced, kill there 1 flight of fighters and they are harmless to subcaps, i suspect you largest issue may be with scaling, noteably that supercarrier pilots by in large tend to coalesce into a few capital heavy groups, i.e. pl, nc. goons ect."
1/13/2015,"@ junei don't think you are grasping the point.. whether you were ok'ed to be there or not, doesn't really matter. the problem is that the csm has a limited time with ccp devs. from what i have heard, especially the relaxed times at the pub can be very us"
1/13/2015,"you are asking a loaded question that presumes an unjustified assumption.i answered the original question without the unjustified assumption above already. my viewpoint is that the csm should not discuss ndaed material in public settings, and that a pub counts as a public setting. it is not required to discuss ndaed material to have relaxed/social time be productive and useful."
1/13/2015,"concern acknowledged. i do think there are some clever ways as far as making nullsec more capable of supplying itself without having a dependency upon jump freight in order to mitigate that problem. but yes, you are correct that there is a tension there. the main issue remaining with supers is the massive spidertanking ability. supers already enjoy the huge advantage over dreads of being ewar immune when being moved, and not having to siege in order to apply their damage. they don't also need the ability to spidertank, such that 20+ of them are functionally untouchable. if they're made much thinner, and more in the style of tier 3 bcs that dish out damage, but die if tackled, they'd be substantially better balanced.hero mildir has had some discussions about how to counter supers. unfortunately, we don't believe that killing flights of fighters actually is practical and useful with the way that massed supers currently are used. subcapital fleets cannot remain on field against massed fighters plus a few nigh-invincible battleships/tech3 antibombers with triage/slowcat support. two solid waves of bombs must connect for fighters to die.if you have a better mechanism to suggest for ""just"" killing the fighters i'm all ears, but it's easier said than done."
1/13/2015,"we had a great time afterwards, actually, although aforementioned dog issues combined with a hangover made hiking a somewhat ambitious plan.as for why invite her...why else does one invite someone to a bar? hanging out and having fun is a thing, i didn't want to have to pick between social groups, so i asked about it. she worried about being welcome, i said it'd be totally fine. are you expecting someone to turn down a good-faith invitation to socialize because they're worried about something coming up, despite assurances it's completely legit?seriously, if this is (was) a problem, it's a problem with me, not june. i've been known to fall victim to geek social fallacy #4 before, it happens. talk to me or ccp leeloo about it, and go back to asking june tricky questions about, oh, i dunno, the position of newbie coalitions in eve or something like that."
1/13/2015,"i totally agree it is an issue ali caused, not june. june however could have prevented it by saying it was better to meet seperately. you cut the csms valuable and constructive time with ccp. just because you can invite her, doesn't mean you should have. however, you are not running again ali, so i stopped caring. she however might get into the csm and therefore is a concern. as a potential csm member you should be able to handle tricky or loaded questions without becoming too defensive. responding to someone asking if they have stopped beating their wife, isn't quite a constructive answer (if you dont know what i am referring to, read reddit people)."
1/13/2015,"you are dodging the question. let's have a link fight.by the way, your ""viewpoint"" about whether a particular discussion should or shouldn't occur isn't germane. it seems like that at least one of the csm who was there had an issue with your presence. also, discussions at public venues can remain private as long as nobody's too drunk to keep their voices under control. but that assumes everyone in the conversation is an appropriate participant. you weren't, so perhaps your presence stifled any option to continue productive work.has hero identified a candidate for this year's csm yet? do you suppose that they have one? are you actively campaigning to be that person? if there is someone else selected to be the coalition candidate, will you step aside so as not to split their vote and possibly cost them a seat?"
1/13/2015,"i cannot speak for hero regarding any kind of official coalition balloting. lquid drisseg is the person determining that, as per the cnm meeting notes.as i said originally, i ran without regard to whether i was getting support from my blues. i would be delighted if i were placed anywhere on the hero ballot at all, but i expect my support to come from sources inside and outside hero. the stv process means that the concept of 'vote splitting' is meaningless, as long as people vote a sufficiently long slate.i intend to endorse anyone that i feel would make a good csm candidate, regardless of whether they are in hero or not."
1/13/2015,i have sent you a mail. hope to hear back soon.
1/13/2015,did you read the op where i specifically listed some of the actual concrete things i have achieved this term?
1/13/2015,"are you happy with the current state of the jump fatigue mechanics?actually i will go into more depth here, i don't think any rational indivdual will argue that having fatigue as a part of the game is bad, but as currently implemented the upper level punishment for generating a large amount of fatigue seems overly harsh. mainly i am referring to the upper boundry where once you are 30 days of fatigue, if you want to realistically be mobile agian via jb, titan bridge or in a capital you essentially have to sit and wait nearly the full 30 days before doing an activity that generates fatigue. so this in mind how do you feel about the state of jump fatigue mechanics."
1/13/2015,"this is something that i want changed to. the idea was to stop rapid movement over large distances, but giving someone a 30 day punishment where that player can't use jb's or jump drives is way to harsh. it should be max a few days or a week at the most. this would still achieve the intent but wont completely handicap a player for a unreasonable amount of time."
1/13/2015,"first, i'm a little bit drunk.second, i think you were ""in office"" while i was just starting my eve career and i just want to know if it is true that you started a war over comments made at fan fest. if so, do you think it was a good idea and do you regret doing. i am just asking because i think honesty and openness is a big part of being a successful csm. i don't care one way or the other because i just want to hear it from the horse's mouth to turn a phrase.third, i am a solo ""carebear"" player that likes to mine roids and explore highsec and lowsec. do you think that making mining anoms non-scannable has hurt carebear mining?furthermore, would you agree that switching wh anoms and mining anoms would help. for example, making wh anoms show up like mining anoms do now and changing mining anoms to a thing that has to be scanned down. i feel, yes i used the word feel, that right now mining anoms enables gankers and un-enables people whom might want to explore wh? changing wh anoms to an open warp to mechanic could give wh more action, do you believe that changing them would help or hurt the game?lastly, i think that the jump fatigue is a good thing and even though i have never fought in a large battle or been a part of a fleet that jumped across the galaxy to fight in a ""news worthy"" fight that jf is good for the whole of the game. again, i just want to hear a response from a person whom has done these things and is running to represent me. there is no wrong answer.yesterday's weirdness is tomorrow's reason why. hunter s. thompson"
1/13/2015,"y'know what the great thing about re-running for csm is?you can make claims about what you did or did not do on your term. since it's all under nda anyway, you don't have to prove it... and no one else can present evidence to the contrary~"

1/14/2015,"i was reading through some old csm minutes, and i saw the issue of high sp characters stuck in titans, and other caps, raised. this has been discussed quite a bit, and perhaps someone has already though of my idea, but i thought why not share, if it may make the game a bit better (i don't even own a cap).so my idea is to allow titans, and maybe supercarriers to enter a sort of 'stationary' mode, basically allowing the pilot jc out. it might be necessary to restrict this only to supers inside pos shields, to prevent sneaking supers into a system from becoming too op a tactic, but that's it. this ship itself should either disappear, or stay inside the pos shields, unable to be boarded or otherwise ****** with.of course, coalitions and alliances will want to have a good number of deployable supers at all times, but that's a strategic decision.this also already happens to some extent with holding characters. i'm not sure how widely adopted those are, and besides, my proposed method of doing it seems way more convenient.so what do you think?"

1/14/2015,"i never said it was fixed. the only thing typical is the percentage of posters here that didn't bother reading anything before clicking ""post"". satirical or not, this is kind of my point. ccp has such robust methods to shut down bot and rmt farms; yet these same methods are not used for vote farming. the legitimacy of voting blocs is not in question.i take issue with the reality that according to ccp and the csm whitepaper, there is not a single policy prohibiting the wholesale purchase and plexing of accounts for the sole purpose of vote power. buying loads of accounts and actually playing them or using them is entirely different than only ever logging them in to plex them."

1/14/2015,i don't have the time or patience to read this entire thread.how do you feel about ganking innocent miners and haulers in high sec?
1/14/2015,"there is nothing 'innocent' about miners or haulers. they are economic combatants in market warfare.just as drones are a good countermeasure against ecm in starship combat, gank ships are a good countermeasure to mining barges in market warfare.if the miners and haulers want safety, highsec offers them the tools to seize it. they need to learn to use those tools."
1/14/2015,i'm trying really hard to envision guilty miners...
1/14/2015,"it's not hard. the miner who is gathering resources to build ships that will support the alliance that is trying to take your sov? the miner that is flooding the market with under-priced (from your point of view) ore (possibly gathered by eula-breaking means), devaluing your efforts? the rival mining corp that organizes a fleet and takes most of the ice after the anomaly spawns in your home system, leaving you without fuel to run your industry pos? there are are plenty of reasons that miners are ""guilty"" of working against your interests. you gotta love the sandbox."
1/14/2015,"i don't see miners as guilty, but then i don't see anyone else as guilty either. we're all just having a lot of fun in the sand box. people need to realize it's just a game.ganking barges in highsec can be a method to boost mineral prices, or a tool for boosting the value of one's killboard, or perhaps even as a way to fulfill one's own belief that miners should be eliminated. and these purposes as well as many other possible purposes can all have a wide variety of motives and specific reasoning behind them. all in all, everyone has their own reason for doing what they do, and we group together with people who have similar yet not the same interests."
1/14/2015,"this.or, you may have no concerns whatsoever about mining, but you might desire to increase sales of the hulks you build."
1/14/2015,"whelp. i'm ashamed of having initially written you off simply due to your alliance ticker - i should know better than that.after having actually read your op, i have to say i'm rather impressed with your platform and a lot of the points that you've made regarding highsec. i'm going to have to take a listen to the soundclouds you've posted, and i must say i'm looking forward to your interviews with both cap stable and just for crits. too many who have come before you simply spew the same old tired lines about theme parks and tears; it's quite refreshing to hear a well reasoned and passionate voice supporting highsec conflict.i have three questions for you, all of which i have chosen to ask because i myself have not formed an opinion on them one way or another - i'd love to hear what you think and why. please don't assume that these questions are asked with a bias, as i have none, and i most certainly won't be upset if you answer the question in a certain way, as long as your opinions are backed up. my first question is regarding the formation of highsec groups and corporations. prefacing this with my opinion that ""conflict in eve is always a good thing,"" do you feel that the current corporation mechanics are sufficient for non-pvp groups to handle wardecs and other forms of non-consensual pvp? if no, what changes to corporations and alliance would allow for groups of players to form highsec based entities and still be able to resist or, better yet, fight back against a pvp centric organization?again with wardecs, what do you think about changing wardecs to a regional or decentralized system instead of the current universal license to ignore concord? for example, maybe the war is only valid if your target is in a mining barge, or located in jita. a much more detailed version of this idea was proposed by marlona sky if you'd like to look it up for reference, i don't have the link handy.lastly, mike azariah half jokingly proposed a ""peace dec"" mechanic where instead of one corporation essentially forcing the pvp playstyle upon a non-pvp entity, the tables are reversed. in essence, it would be conducting non-consensual pve against a pvp target, forcing them to do some sort of non-pvp activity. ignoring the specifics of the proposed mechanic, what do you think about a concept of the ""peace dec""?that's all for now."
1/14/2015,sugar will likely always be my top vote. easily the mvp of the csm.
1/14/2015,"good reply, however the question was directed at endie, and it's his opinions i am interested in.as far as i can see, the pp nerfs have had little effect on null-sec. it's still in a state of stagnation, and while null is dominated one coalition it always will be. regardless of any changes to sov ccp makes."
1/14/2015,i'm not sure how the cfc could have done any better. could anything less or more really be expected of us?
1/14/2015,"sounds like you're certainly on the right path.when you say.... that is the exact intent of the proposed change, and precisely where the current mechanics fall short."
1/14/2015,"besides the fact that jayne has created a huge amount of content for the game and community already, with the upcoming corp mechanics revision there's probably no one more needed on the csm than him."

1/14/2015,"for those of you interested in the csm process, i highly recommend reading ccp leeloo's dev blog from today wherein i detail what i feel my accomplishments were this term:"
1/14/2015,"actually, i think this is pretty fair cop. the things you list are the weekly updates and having ""played a small part"" in the null sec discussion. you specifically talk a lot about ""ccp"" and ""the csm"" but don't list your actual contributions. additionally, you mention in the ccp dev blog about the input broadcasting which was a pretty hot topic for most csm members. do you see your role as mainly an unofficial csm reporter?the other question is pretty fair, are you an official pl candidate?"
1/14/2015,"could you to give an example of a change to the game you have advocated for while on the csm that would be good for the game in general, in your estimation, but potentially bad for your own corporation/alliance/coalition as an in-game entity?"
1/14/2015,unless someone else also on the csm calls you out. i'd take that at as evidence.
1/14/2015,"sorry for my lack of answering, i had monday, tuesday as my weekend with the wife!the war i wanted never started due to my own self making comments at fanfest that in itself helped to bring down the coalition i was at that time at the helm of.do i regret it, nope not at all. some of the things i said at fanfest i am disappointed in myself for saying some of the things i did. i generally do not like to talk eve when i meet people in real life. and even though my wife told me on numerous occasions to shut my mouth i did not. i have never hid anything regarding that time just that their is 2 sides to every story and my side i should have been more vocal or in some cases less vocal.regarding your last point, in some ways fatigue has helped the game a lot but in other ways it has really hindered it. i never agreed with the mass power projection of the old days but i find myself leading an alliance of newer, older and mid level players and with this i find that people are ending up knee deep in fatigue that they should not have simply because the system that could have been quite easily adapted to be a whole lot simpler. the unfortunate thing is that ccp is never known for doing things the simpler way they always over extend then nerf back towards what they want. i had hoped that if they made some jump changes it would not end up in some pilots with 30 days without being able to jump and the only way to combat that being log out for 30 days or fly the whole time in a frig.in summary as i may have gotten a bit off topic with your last question i do believe the idea behind the concept of fatigue was good but the implementation like we see with ccp every time was poor and not completely thought out."
1/14/2015,"well honestly sort, the major reason with fatigue, particularly your coalition is that you're trying to fight on two fronts to defend a fairly vast empire. so yes you have members that get 30 day jump fatigue but what do you expect when you fight both in delve/fountain and the south?"
1/14/2015,"see that is not true. most of my guys who have 30 days fatigue come from basic travel around delve, we rarely take titans or jump bridges far out of delve. we probe wormholes which we have in abundance and then use them. it would be nice to have a fatigue bonus inside of your own sov to help with defence, outside of that i do believe it should be effected for sure.but please tell me more about how much alliance has fatigue from 2 fronts. :)"

1/14/2015,
1/15/2015,i support the idea of expanding captains quarter. they are kind of an embarrassment right now. at the very least i'd like the ability to modify the quarters with decorations. though ultimately there's no point to walking in stations if we can't interact with other players.
1/15/2015,those that are complaining shouldn't have a super then as most super pilots have alts since this game is based on what you can do with how many alts you have
1/15/2015,then alliances will be able to stockpile titans and supers without concern for having pilots for them. that's a hilariously bad idea. supercapital proliferation is a big enough problem as it is.
1/15/2015,you should post with your mains like xenuria wants us to.i wonder could xenuria be using mass amounts of accounts to vote for him.
1/15/2015,"i actually think social-corps as a middle ground between npc and real corps is a horrible idea, and just another carebear-proffed stealth nerf-hisec idea to make those that refuse to put mind in motion yet another mechanism to avoid wars entirely, when they are today already 100% consensual because you can just hide out in said npc corp... the answer to making wars meaningful isn't giving carebears both a 0% tax rate dodge and 100% protection from wardecs with a 'social corp' abomination. (tora, you listening?)however, i do think overall i would still rather a tora bushido on the csm who at least actually knows what the f#ck he is talking about re: war mechanics, than a mike asariah (or null-bear) who would simply nerf the hell out of hisec war mechanics and kill the entire vibrant hisec mercenary community in the process.im not sure where our csm's lost the f#cking plot on the concepts of htfu and non-consensual conflict being core to what eve is about, and in the quest for 'moar subs!' decided to throw the baby out with the bathwater, but i do believe tora (and sabriz) will at least seek true balance with any proposed changes by ccp, not help ccp slit their own throats like a carebear or nullbear csm who is clueless about hisec mechanics.f"
1/15/2015,"i think it will do exactly the opposite. i want to drag people out of the npc corp and into a normal corp. it's like when you let someone taste some food for free, hoping they like it so much, they will buy it themselves. so in this case, let them see why a corp can be much more fun then npc, in the hope they create a normal corp. if they dont, nothing is lost, as they normally would have stayed in the npc corp anyway. you can only win this way. i do agree on the tax thing. it shouldn't be 0% or it will just be a way to avoid taxes.."
1/15/2015,"reading some of the other csm-x candidates posts makes me wonder if i should increase the dark side in my campaign. all i read is nerf, nerf nerf nerf. what happened to all these carebears. htfu !"
1/15/2015,"my opinion about ganking is the same as lootwhoring on stations,1.the ganker should not be able to dock for 15 minutes , we all know he will pod his way out so he can warped to a safe en wait it out there. 2.as for the person that takes the loot of the ganked ship or any loot in general that isnt his, no docking for 15 minutes and work out a 'no warp security system"" wich will prevent the suspect at that moment not able to insta warp to a safespot.this will rule out 1 of the most irritation issues in high sec. atleast thats my opninion.second i dont see whats the fuzz is about on high sec wardecking, or why it should be nurved because a null carebear doesnt like it, the only 1 in my opinion who can talk about wardecks in highsec should be the top highsec wardecking corps. they know what is fair and what is not. nerfing the **** out of it due to losing isk in highsec is not a mechanic faillure but a alliance faillure. educate your members and isk should not be lost.just my 2 cents.!!"
1/15/2015,"i added numbers to make my opinions more clear.1. i wouldn't have any problem with that but i think having to travel in order to cash in your tags opens up the possibility of people getting popped with a cargo full of tags. not that it couldn't happen, but it would happen less. with the system as it is now the tags are all being concentrated in a few systems, which makes interference easier. i don' think it would be a benefit to the game, but i don't think it would break anything either. 2. are you talking on the ship end of things or on the pos end of things?3. upgrades to get local back. hmm. that's kind of interesting. it would make being in less active systems much more dangerous, and wouldn't really change populated systems. i think the idea has merit."

1/15/2015,i care for the wellbeing of eve as a whole. that<U+FFFD>s why corbex gets my vote.
1/15/2015,"hoping sabriz blasts you and your ideas from this thread, and in so doing validates our faith in him as a candidate to hold the line on eve's founding htfu traditions.p.s.this is all you need to survive wardecs, carebear proffed pansification changes to actual game mechanics are *not* required or wanted.f"
1/15/2015,"it should also be noted that as it is a game, often what you say and what you actually believe are very different things."
1/15/2015,"what a ******* joke. people like you are the reason i initially discounted sabriz.the list that you linked gives great advice such as ""have a second account"" and ""don't play the game."" classic.beyond that, the only thing you're encouraging people to do in that joke of a list is evade and survive rather than fight, resist, and thrive. you wouldn't be singing such a pretty tune if the playstyle that you didn't enjoy participating in could be forced upon you just as easily. htfu indeed. wow. such compelling gameplay. this raises issues with both current corporation mechanics,and the necessity for a second account. code. has 300 members, marmite has 150. hardly practical, and still recommended in order to avoid conflict."
1/15/2015,"re the first question. firstly all corporations are involved in pvp all the time, even if they aren't involved in starship combat. running missions for the sisters of eve, turning your loyalty points into sisters probes, selling them on the market and using that isk to buy a kronos, deadspace modules and a plex is a form of real-loss pvp, in which the winners are the explorers that looted those deadspace modules, end users of sisters probes and the kronos manufacturer, and the losers are other holders of sisters lps and other net users of plex.the winners and losers in this case gain (or lose) more than those involved in a tech 1 battlecruiser 1v1 fight, or a catalyst ganking a covetor.but let's focus solely on starship combat pvp and corporations that do not specialise in it, as i assume this is what you mean..the defenders have considerable advantages in a war, mostly the ability to source allies. if your corporation feels completely outmatched, you have the ability to source outside help. i have seen this done effectively to me in the past - after i declared war against a mining corporation, they brought in competent mercenaries that scored two or three kills against me and totally neutralized my ability to project force into their system.in addition the defenders have the ability to reship. unless they are a dedicated mining alt, even the most mining centered of characters usually has the ability to fly tech 1 frigates acceptably well, and a swarm of t1 frigates and destroyers is extremely effective if led with even a shred of competence.what is needed for the defenders isn't rule changes that favor them (the present system does that to a significant but balanced degree). what they need is advice as to how to resist effectively.re the second question and strategic objective focused wardecs.were it to be an isolated change, a restricted wardec would be an interesting mechanic. however, i have no faith that a strategic objective focused wardec could be implemented in a way that wasn't simply about reducing conflict overall.re the third question. money is the universal equivalent - something you can trade for the time of other people. wardeccers (and other starship combat pvp focused players) need to support their actions somehow. i support mine primarily through trading and tech 2 production (i've sold 43 lachesis hulls since the patch, for instance). even if some change to this effect was made (and i do not support such a change), i'd get around it by paying useful idiots (sorry, people who do not value their time) to do it for me, much the same as i pay useful idiots to do all of my for-profit and alliance logistics related hauling; just as a corp can currently outsource its starship combat pvp to mercenaries."
1/15/2015,"his advice (which is good) is to stop carrying out activities where you are easy prey. you can still carry out those activities with a red in system (i've run missions to fix my sec status with public killrights against me, so basically everyone in the system is a war target), but with extreme care.as soon as the red appears in local, put the battleship away immediately, and run the mission in an agile ship that can escape - a heavy assault cruiser or strategic cruiser. or alternately if you can't fly those or aren't experienced with them, do it in a tech 2 fitted insured tech 1 battlecruiser hull, where any loss won't hurt, and watch d-scan like a hawk.want to mine? downship to a venture. you are now extremely tough to catch and kill, and if you do get popped, so what? let them kill you twice, then make the third time a trap.the 'add aggressors to watchlist' advice is for out-of-corp alts. eve is a game where alts help a lot, but they are not needed."
1/15/2015,"good answers! even if you were on the csm yourself? anyways, follow up question. if it is as you say, and wars favour the defender, why have we not seen any incursion based corporations or alliances that operate specifically in highsec? these individuals are likely the most educated in pvp, or at least the in-game combat system, and yet we still see them operating out of chat channels and solo or npc corps to avoid wars.the following question assumes that creating highsec based non-pvp corporations is a good thing, regardless of your opinion:what changes to the corporation mechanic and wardec system (specifically the hiring of mercenaries) would have to change in order to make it worthwhile for these groups to actually forms corporations and alliances despite the threat of wardecs?"
1/15/2015,"it's because the theorycrafters behind the incursion community have recognised that, given their goal of maximizing isk per hour, the game theoretically correct decision is to be in npc corps or single-player corps with no alliance affiliation. they are correct. a conflict-ready incursion corporation makes less isk per hour operating in highsec, lowsec or non-sov nullsec than a conflict-averse atomized incursion fleet makes operating in highsec.i would seek to change that equation, so that both conflict-ready and conflict-averse play are possible, and conflict-ready play is the more lucrative option.concrete suggestions follow. you will notice that these *all* focus on the rewards side of incursions, as presently incursion runners have plenty of tools to protect themselves militarily, they simply elect not to use them:- move most of the liquid isk rewards for incursions out of highsec. keep the lp in highsec and increase them to partially compensate.- change the npc tax mechanics so that the tax paid is lower for 'pve dabblers' (e.g. a newbie running level 3 missions inefficiently) and higher for 'career pve players' (e.g. a veteran blitzing l4s or incursions)- provide better rewards for incursions in dangerous space. 50% more is not enough when the nature of the space makes fielding expensive ships a poor idea.- provide rewards where long-standing corp membership in a corp that specialises in incursions is rewarded with increased lp payouts. i have ideas for this for missions and mining; for incursions i'd need to pick a few people's brains."
1/15/2015,"furthermore, i feel like you are constructing a strawman to some extent.the way you talk about wars sounds like an idealized version of how i see them as currently existing in the eve meta. you're mainly discussing using the wardec system as a tool for conducting non-spaceship pvp, which i completely agree is both a valid playstyle and a necessity for competition in highsec. my concerns regarding the current state of highsec wars and pvp is the prevailing trend for wardecs to be used as a broad brush to farm kills from new players and the otherwise uninformed. none of the ulterior motives such as market pvp or disrupting the logistics of a hostile corporation are present, the only motivation that exists is simply to kill anyone who dares use a trade hub or a pipeline system. the marmite collective currently has 1300 active wars, and 95% of all their kills occur in either a trade hub, madirmilire, or uedama. (that's not a guess, i checked).targeted aggression in highsec is fine - more than fine, it's awesome.... but a blanket license to prevent 1300 different corporations simultaneously from using trade hubs or even travel?is this something that you think is okay? how would mercenaries be able to help a corporation in this situation?"
1/15/2015,"good suggestions, and made with an intent i can support. +1"
1/15/2015,everyone in eve is guilty and they should all be shot and podded.
1/15/2015,i call bull ****. cant remember we ever had 1300 active wars.
1/15/2015,"i get that this is tongue-in-cheek but it really does highlight a misperception the hardcore carebear has to the game. wardeccers are forced to play the pve/industry playstyle by definition. they need to interact with the economy to acquire the ships and resources to pay for the wardec. if they ""only pvped"", they would quickly be reduced to shooting each other in unfit rookie ships as their combat tools were lost. pvp needs pve/industry and pve/industry needs pvp (or their would be no point to gathering resources and making ships if there was only peace in new eden). so why should players get to decide to opt out of this interrelationship because it is not ""their play-style""? pvpers have to indulge in pve/industry (or find someone to do that for them) so why should industrial corps not be forced to as well? if you don't want to fight, the mechanics are highly slanted in your favour and you can find someone to fight for you either by diplomacy or straight out isk and join you as an ally. i am not claiming wars are perfect, but this idea they are done for ""griefing"" or infringing on some right to be left alone needs to be stomped out. eve is a competitive sandbox game and corporations are one of the basic units of this competition. if you are going to gather resources or engage in industry that competes with my operation, you need to be vulnerable to me and others, even if you want to be left alone. that is just a reality of the sandbox.i do think there is room for a corporation that would could opt-out of this - the so-called social corp. being able to tune your risk is something that could be done better in this game, so a social corp that is immune to wardecs just like the npc corp but has all the restrictions of the current npc corp is something that should be in the game. this would allow a group a friends who just want to have some fun shooting crosses or mining together to do so in relative safety, while leaving the wardecs to the corps that are in actual economic competition with each other."
1/15/2015,"eh, i didn't check in game, just referenced dotlan briefly."
1/15/2015,"may i ask how wars favor defenders currently? last i saw, more than 80% of all wars have been won by the attacker. if a defender can't fight, which most can't which is why they are targeted, they can refused to undock or they can disband corp or they can try to play and not get killed. ccp implemented the ability to hire allies, which is usually just a group who has no intention of fighting for you once paid or an alt corp of the attacker. that's the only way i can think of it being in favor of the defender."
1/15/2015,"industrial corps are forced into pvp. people are constantly told that everything in eve is pvp. when you are on the market, it's against another player, when you are making things, your competing with another player, when you are mining, your mining in competition with another player.with ""pvp only"" players they focus on pvp and brush against the edge of pve, buying from the market and supplementing their income where they desire. a ""pve only"" players does the opposite, they focus on pve and brush into pvp when they compete on the market or try to secure contracts. the problem a lot of pve players is that the pvp player can then force them to engage in combat, forcing the pve player to either stop playing on play the way the pvp player plays. so why shouldn't the pve player be able to force the pvp player to either stop playing or play the way they play?i'm not saying this is actually something that should be put in, but i do understand the frustration they feel from have someone else decide to change their playstyle for a small fee."
1/15/2015,"you seem to maybe be missing the point. this is a competitive sandbox game where we compete with each other on multiple levels both direct pvp ship combat, economic pvp, and while doing industry/pve. you cannot separate the two in this sandbox game. pvp players need ships to be effective at their wardecs which they can buy from the market (but they do need isk from somewhere), but by doing that they are paying another player to do the pve and industry for them. while it may be true that it is harder to buy ""pvp"" defense from the market, a pve player can do the exact same thing, hire mercenaries to defend their operations. allowing players to compete in complete safety from other players breaks many things.you can only pve and do industry in this game, but like a pvper who has to find someone to hire him or give him ships because he dislikes pve/industry, you better make arrangements for other players to provide your defense. join a balanced corp, make an arrangement with a pvp corp (some of your industry for a guaranteed ally in a wardec?), or hire mercenaries, but you are at risk in new eden and you cannot abdicate your defense because it is not ""your play-style"". well you can, but then don't complain when you are a constant target for your competitors who have arranged their defenses properly and have you and your undefended organization in their sights. that is just the nature of the game.but i agree with you, industrial corps are forced to pvp but this is a pvp game. if you want the rewards that come from out-competing other players in the sandbox, you have to accept that these other players might want to stop you. i could see how this might be frustrating to players that don't understand this, but that really is how eve has been designed.now that all said, wardec mechanics aren't even close to perfect. sabriz has some good ideas that could make wars more entertaining for both sides."
1/15/2015,"seriously sabriz i'm sure if more than able to answer on his own, or do you feel that he isnt and so you have to help him, i've noticed you answering alot of stuff addressed to him, is there a problem that you feel sabriz cant answer himself?"
1/15/2015,"not at all, although he is probably sleeping now. plaan jaynara responded directly to my comment on a question from yesterday, one that sabriz had already had his say on, so i felt it appropriate to give her the courtesy of a response. i am sure if sabriz has something to add or to disagree with me on he will when he wakes up, but he has indicated previously in this thread he is fine with using this thread to discuss issues related to his csm platform."
1/15/2015,"i'm not separating the two. i'm asking why on one side a player can force another player to either stop playing or engage in combat, while the other side can't. as you rightly show, you can buy a wardec. a wardec is bought from an npc to allow a group of fighters to attack a group of industrialists. why then does a group of industrialists have to pay a different group of fighters if they want to fight back? surely either the industrialists should have an npc to buy a ""you can't attack people for a week"" permit from, or the fighters should have to pay a group of industrialists for the ability to fight another set of industrialists which they may or may not come through for.when i said that i meant it as in the ""pve"" they do *is* pvp. this game is all about pvp, but it isn't all about combat. pvp players only have to touch on the industrial side, industrialists only have to touch on the combat side. unless of course the combat side decides they want to go after an industrialist at which point the industrialist has to combat - either himself or via a third party - or stop playing.i'm on neither side of this, i just understand why people are frustrated by this system. adding a ""peace dec"" is clearly a silly idea, but it raises a good point about why somebody who chooses combat should be able to pay an npc to force a industrialist into hiding or fighting, while an industrialist has no method of returning the favor. perhaps industrial ships should be significantly better at defending themselves, gate and station guns should be buffed to the nuts, and concord should only defend certain players to protect newer players removing the need to pay for wardecs altogether. stations would not want fighting on their doorstep, so they'd make sure to take care of that, but out in a belt or a mission site you're as strong as your group."
1/15/2015,"i see what you are saying, but this discrepancy stems for the fact that corporations are the basic unit of competition in a pvp game. you are right that this means that all competitive corporations can be forced to engage in ship pvp, or hire someone to protect their corp. the wardec really is just the ""lubricant"" for allowing the underlying conflict to take place. you cannot opt out of this competition because it is the very nature of the sandbox. as for ""buying"" your way out of a wardec it is probably not a mechanic because it is essentially ""isk-tanking"" and would favour, richer, more established corporations. if you read the last wardec devblog you can that the last changes were intended for you to spend that money not on bribes to concord, but on mercenaries. perhaps sabriz has a different view, but i think a ""counter-bribe"" is not a good idea, however clearly the last changes didn't work out as well team super friends had hoped. of course you are right - there is much more to this game than ship combat. however, just like the pvp player has to deal with industry somehow, the industrialist has to deal with his competitors wanting to blow up his operations somehow. that is the game. clearly there could be mechanisms introduced into the game to facilitate industrialists finding allies to help defend them. or i would support mechanisms, like the social corp, that would allow them to continue industry/pve without the risk of wardecs, but less efficiently than a corp that took on the responsibility of defending themselves from their competitor corps. or perhaps sabriz has another idea of how industrial corps could be integrated with pvp corps as was intended by the developers. but ultimately, industrialists have to be made to understand that the corp that just wardecced you doesn't hate you or want to stop your fun, but rather they are just competing with you for power and riches in the sandbox that is new eden. i can see that too. new players and corps should have some protection from the ""big boys"" when they are starting out, but that can't last forever, especially once they are influencing the greater economy. ultimately, a single industrialist or a small group of industrialists is going to have a hard time competing with the ""big boys"" by themselves. highsec is not suppose to be a risk-free place for industry, nor a corporation's assets immune from the touch of their competitors (and this has never been the case in the last 11-years of eve). if a large number of players think that this is the case, then ccp is not doing a good job at setting the expectations for new players at what kind of game this really is. i think i have had my say on this issue, but i will finish by saying that wardec and corporation reform is a serious issue for the highsec community and one of the reasons why i think sabriz would make an excellent representative because of his deep understanding of these dynamics."
1/15/2015,if industrial corporations were able to pay in order to be immune to war decs than the only groups we'd be able to wardec would be smaller corps who cannot afford to keep paying for such a permit. richer industrial alliances would completely immune from war decs. at the end of the day the newer players would get preyed on even more and the older richer players even less. i think it can be agreed that this is the exact opposite of what would be good for the game.
1/15/2015,"i have no issue with discussions happening on this thread, someone may well have an idea that i hadn't thought of that is better than what i would have come up with. i was indeed asleep at the time, but i broadly agree with pedro's answers, with the caveat that i do a significant amount of starship and module production and that that is (for me) a significant part of how i funded ganking (when i focused on ganking) and now how i fund ships for wardeccing. i have nine ishtar build jobs running right now and a lot of invention jobs running, and i consider these activities to be real-loss pvp, every bit as much as i consider last weekend's engagements against a war target corp. other people who build ishtars are engaged in pvp against me; people who produce crystalline carbonide armor plates and photon microprocessors are engaged in pvp alongside me.i want to elaborate on the controversial 'the defenders have the advantage' comment i made earlier. aggressors have the initiative in wars, but defenders have the capacity to escalate in a war, and a very important 24 hour warning period. aggressors receive only a four hour warning period when the defender calls in an ally.this is why my corporation doesn't try to establish and defend a pos, despite me alone doing enough production to warrant one. if we had a pos, and wardecced a mining corporation that didn't want to fight us, that corp could then wait until only 2 or 3 of us are online (plus maybe one or two of our -10 gank alts in other code. corps), then reinforce our pos with four hour's warning.that said, the defenders need to *use* this advantage, which entails engaging in the sandbox, negotiating mercenary contracts and a payment structure, researching the various mercenaries available to determine which ones offer the most useful services, deciding whether a third party is needed, and planning elaborate traps with your mercenary allies.'industrial' corporations like that earn my respect, because they take advantages offered and use them to their fullest.as for marmites having 1300 active wars - that would cost them 65 billion isk per week minimum. i'd be stunned if marmites spend more than 10% of that."

1/15/2015,"i'm currently the director for education, recruitment and human resources for the brave collective (lovingly known as the dept of infernal repairs). i've held this post for the last six months or so. i<U+FFFD>ve gradually added to my portfolio since i took over as the head of education a bit over a year ago. i'm a relatively new player to eve, i've been playing for only about two years. i joined brave newbies in its infancy, and quickly came to love the do and die attitude that we hold dear. i also love our spirit of focussing on the new player, and being a welcoming and accepting place for all newbies. i love this game. i love its infinite complexity, its difficulty, its incomprehensibility. i love that it's really about people, and not about clicking a button over and over again. i love that when you play it, you can get embroiled in a war that spans the whole galaxy, or you can live in a single system, a single station even, and play it to a great depth of complexity. i love that we have ancient characters with millions of skillpoints and thousands of hours of playtime coexisting with one hour newbies who don' t know how to undock. i love that we have a vibrant community that is alive with interest and culture, our own gatherings, fan art and fiction, and an incredible diversity - with players from all around the world coming together to kill, scam, support, educate, entertain and delight each other. i've never found anything else like it. in my role as the head of the infernal repairs division, i have been responsible for more newbies than any other person in the game. under my stewardship, the brave collective has gone from shitfit destroyers in rahadalon, to trading punches with the heaviest hitters in the game. i am proud that our education department, the brave dojo, has become a true force for teaching and education within the game. i cannot, of course, take credit for the hard work of our other leaders, of our tutors, of the bittervets who sit in our help channel and donate hundreds of hours a day to teaching newbies the error of their ways. nor would i want to. it's our players who make us great - i'm just trying to herd them towards a common goal. however, i<U+FFFD>ve guided and cajoled, threatened and wheedled us into something great, and now i want to represent the new player in new eden to the game.bob knows i'm no expert on the game. i'm pretty terrible. i don't know who the major players in the game are. i don't know the history. i don't know the lore. i don't even know what a jita is. (some sort of minmatar probing frigate, right?) i don't know the best way to nerf an ishtar.i do know newbies. brave and a lot of the other newbie friendly organisations do a fantastic job of attracting new players. go sit in a help channel or trawl reddit for a while, i'm willing to bet that within about 5 minutes you'll see someone recommending brave as a good place to start in the game. i love that - i love that people come to try us as a jumping off point. i hate that so many of those players never come back after their trial ends. i have the benefit of never kicking inactives, so i can see the damage that our failure to capture those newbies has done. i<U+FFFD>m sure there are many thousands more, who<U+FFFD>ve passed through e-uni, rvb, test, the goons. our new player experience is failing our community. i want to change that. i want to make it easier to look after new players. i want to see a full suite of tools become available to a corp leadership to make it easy to manage newbies. i recently gave some feedback to ccp rise and mimic about this very subject. my platform is simple. push the newbie agenda. push the expansion of the game. push the retention of newbies, push the new player experience. keep them coming in. keep them interested. keep the game alive for you and for me. i'll ask a million dumb questions every meeting. the other csm delegates will get sick of answering them. i will not represent a bloc, or a faction, or a specific interest group other than the newbie. i represent the new player, and i represent corporations trying to assist them. i am engaged in the eve community, having visited (and presented at) my first player gathering at the excellent evedownunder. you can see that presentation here. i know that brave doesn<U+FFFD>t have a fantastic track record with csm candidates. that<U+FFFD>s a given. matias burned with revolutionary zeal, but was unable to reconcile his real life obligations with the responsibilities of the csm. i have a proven track record of working to accomplish goals, and i believe i am up to the challenge. i<U+FFFD>m very approachable, i listen to advice, even if i don<U+FFFD>t always take it, i<U+FFFD>m open to new information, and hope that i<U+FFFD>ll make an excellent representative. i ask you for your support."

1/15/2015,"thanks for the question. i come from brave, so i actually love being on the receiving end of wardecs. i know a lot of people don't though, and i know that newbies are often crushed by wardecs (and having all their noob-loot blown up in untanked t1 haulers). i don't know how i'd change the wardec dynamic, but nothing should remain static forever: that's what makes this game great. i've flown freighters and been ganked, so i feel the pain of your victims. having said that, i watched one of mine and admire the craftsmanship and professionalism that i saw there. i'd hate to see a loss to the game of that form of gameplay. having said that, i do feel that there could be a way to add a complimentary style of gameplay: maybe adding the ability for a player to act as the police instead of only (seemingly) encouraging the pirate. i don't believe that highsec should be pvp free, and i am an advocate of non-consensual pvp. (even if it hurts me personally)sov: being new to the sov game, i know that giant, pre-scheduled timerfights are less than optimal. i'd love to see some change there, and i see the scope for new players to access sov without the giant blob power of brave, or massed and serried ranks of supercapitals. more content, more empowerment for all of our players!"

1/15/2015,"cagali,i've been pondering that myself. the problem, imo, is that changing corporations/alliances often involves changing locale, and there is no ""transition period"" for moving stuff. take hero, for example: if you're not in hero, our home region of catch is dangerous. if you're in hero, hisec is dangerous. nailing that transition is tough, and beyond the understanding of most newly-recruited newbros.best idea i've hashed up is a 3-day grace period after joining a new corporation before its wardecs apply to you. trick would be making sure people can't exploit it; perhaps your previous corporation's wardecs still apply to you 3 days after you leave it? (that would also close up the loophole of members leaving their corp temporarily to avoid a wardec.)"

1/15/2015,"+1, for sure.the dojo is one of the best resources that i've encountered in any online game. no longer do i have to google-fu and hope that the article from four years ago about a semi-obscure topic hasn't been changed. newbies helping newbies sounds like"

1/15/2015,cagali is one of the most genuine people i've ever met. what he says in his post is the real deal.player retention is probably eve's greatest failing and if anyone can sort it out (without ruining the parts of eve that make it great) it's cagali.
1/15/2015,"+1and, as many have said before me, best ""do not reply to this mail"" lines ever."

1/15/2015,+1 you sexy man you!
1/15/2015,"in sorry you feel that way : because i don't represent 0.0, i represent newbies. high, low, null, and wi must disagree with you that i'm clueless. i may not be the most knowledgeable candidate, but i get by. thanks for the effort it took to reply. edit: because i actually do represent newbies."
1/15/2015,so cagali how are you going to differentiate from matias as a guy with a lot of stuff other than eve going on who gets elected and then doesn't do anything on the csm? because right now i can't justify voting for you.
1/15/2015,+1 got my vote!
1/15/2015,"sugar is a good csm member. really seems to represent the player base as a whole, and low sec specifically, very well. sugar will be on my short list for csm x."
1/15/2015,i like what you are saying and i completely agree. if elected would you pursue this platform within csm x? is there anyone within the previous csm which you would see yourself working with on the subject?
1/15/2015,"good to hear this. so this means you fully support the marmite collective in the way they play their game too. you know with all the wars and not nerfing eve to death you will be the last one i would vote for. i think you are a trojan nerf horse in disguise. the csm isnt just about you or your npsi fleets, it's about what the community wants."
1/15/2015,"trojan nerf horse? that's one i haven't heard before... and i rather like it. thanks.to the point tho, i'm not hiding my dislike for the current wardec mechanics - i've always openly disliked them. there are many many things you could do to the mechanic in order to make it more targeted instead of encouraging blanket wardecs, as well as just camping in both trade hubs and pipeline systems. currently, wars serve to both discourage new players from joining a corporation, discourages those corporations from ever forming in the first place, and doesn't provide enough options for a defending group to fight back in a meaningful way.wars are great for hunting down specific individuals or groups, preventing a group from operating in a specific area, removing structures such as poss and pocos, and allowing for large fights between groups such as mercs and rvb etc.these are the facets that should be improved and focused upon.in context of your original quote, i do support your way to play the game, but from a moral or ethical standpoint only. i do not support your playstyle in the same way that i couldn't support the decshield initiative, for one example of many. sure, it was possible for that ""playstyle"" to occur under the old wardec mechanics, but i'm sure you of all people will agree that using the game's mechanics in such a way was broken and needed to be fixed. thankfully it was. heh. so true.... and i never once claimed that i was interested in the csm for a singular purpose..... buuuuuuuuut since we're **** slinging anyway, i like your statement when it reads like this instead: ahh... much better.that's the beautiful thing about democracy, isn't it? if you represent the minority, you get a minority say, no matter how loud you say it - and you are the minority here, make no mistake. i will make no concessions in order to appease you.we'll just have to wait for election day to see what the community truly wants.edit: ...and if the side effect of using the nerf bat here is a better npe, the emergence of more player based groups, and encouraging meaningful conflict between highsec entities, then all i have to say is swing baby swing."
1/15/2015,"htfu eve is real.great, that's exactly what we do. make up your mind, you agree or you don't. you're giving mixed feelings here to your readers.let me guess, you play wow ? might want to exchange flowers too."
1/15/2015,"tora your aware bringing more new guys in and creating content for them to be excited about actualy gives you more people to pad your kb with right? and everyone likes flowers.. cept jayne.. as he is a wooden horse of legend.. anywho a few actual questions for the fearless leader, the bowtie master,the leader of the cultofsash, mr jayne.you get on the panel *yay go you*, what would be the first thing you try and push forward to ccp and why?what is your main reason for wanting to be on the csm.which ship type or module requires the most urgent overhaul in your mind and why?and a fun one.which player made eve video in your mind shows off the game best.ashurmanlong live npsi"
1/15/2015,"after reading your post tora, it seems that you are playing devil's advocate unnecessarily - both you and jayne share the goal of encouraging players out of npc corps and into player created ones. considering you both come from such vastly different backgrounds within the game (low sec fleet/capital pvp as opposed to high sec camping) it seems strange that you would look for an adversary in jayne, rather than someone you can communicate ideas with.your combined perspectives would likely only lead to positive outcomes - no one person can have all the answers on any issue, which is exactly why the csm needs diversity.if i was being a cynic, i would say that your concerns seem based around the idea that the player groups jayne proposes could be used as a way to dodge the current war dec mechanics, in which you obviously have a vested interest. so, my question to jayne is thushow would you ensure that the player groups you propose would be subject to the harsh realities of eve, and not make gentleman like tora's position on the jita undock obsolete."
1/15/2015,"speaking of catch, what problems/issues with large-scale sov combat and older vs younger alliances do you think the recent hero/pl fights highlighted?"

1/15/2015,"key campaign linksmy csm x platformcapstable interviewjust for crits interviewcampaign manifestoo7, capsuleers.ten months ago, i was a nobody. an explorer with an empty wallet and dreams of exploring the galaxy of new eden.today, i'm still a nobody. i don't have any political power or connections. my corporation is staffed almost entirely by people whose pvp experience could be summed up on a fortune cookie label. i spend my nights exploding industrial ships and composing sarcastic evemails. when the mood strikes me, i post videos of these exploits on youtube for an audience of mediocre size.so, why should you believe i can make a difference in eve? ask the 1,000+ people i have gotten into eve online via referrals. ask the 500+ retired eve vets who have emailed me to say my antics got them back in the game. the 20,000+ people who have read my exploration and stealth bomber guides. the 400+ people who have waited weeks and weeks to join wingspan delivery services. the dozens of ""victims"" who have paid me for killing them. those numbers all mean something, and they don't mean ""chance is great."" those numbers mean there are people out there, a lot of people, who are ready to believe in eve online. some for the first time, some after years of bitter cynicism. these are people who are excited for the possibilities eve has now, not just the dream-inspired promises of ccp and csm candidates. these people are inspired by the crazy idea that they don't have to wait for content to happen. they can create it, they can be it, and they can share it with the world, including outside of eve.i share their passion and their optimism. i do not come to this forum with a bag of ""fixes"" for eve - that is the job of game designers and analysts. instead, i come to this forum with the promise to be a voice for progress. a voice for content. a voice for everyone who is ready to dive into the next epoch of eve online with probes launched and torpedoes loaded.give your voice a chance. because if there's one thing you know i can do, it's deliver."
1/15/2015,"i would also like to announce that i am officially co-endorsing suzy rc mudstone for csm x. suzy was instrumental in my eve development, someone who selflessly taught me the ways of nulsec and steered our corporation throught truly tough times. whatever reservations you have about me, give suzy your serious consideration."
1/15/2015,"i really like your videos and i think what you're doing is great. your videos are great simply for the fact that not everything eve pvp related has to be ""leet pvp."" so it's all very down to earth, relateable and most importantly funny.i have to ask, what is your platform? what issues will you seek to address? how?best of luck to you."
1/15/2015,highdrag podcast :)
1/15/2015,"when i saw the video, i did not think it could be true? whoever said dreams dont come true is a dirty f***ing liar+1 from me, maybe some more"
1/15/2015,"what is your opinion on the nullsec subcap meta being dominated by ishtars and tengus in major fleet fights? is this a result of ccp overnerfing certain shiptypes like battleships and battlecruisers, or them allowing things like scanning to be easily conducted for better bombing runs? what is your opinion of the state of capitals and supercapitals in nullsec warfare?sorry for the disjointedness of my questions."
1/15/2015,"nah, you're just taking an opportunity to jump on to something tangential to june's candidacy to be plain rude. this whole visit thing bears no relevance to this thread focused on june's platform and candidacy. if it really rustles your jimmies so badly you can talk about it somewhere else rather than derail this thread.then it's incumbent upon ""that csm"" to make that concern known. if it's such a huge deal then they can just get that request for one friend to spend time with another denied. they went through the proper channels to see if it was okay. they were told it was. this whole conversation is just making the involved look vindictive. they need to sort this stuff out in private.now for something relevant to the thread. i can give my personal support and endorsement of june after spending much of my roughly two years in this game living around and interacting with her and her associates. she has demonstrated to me her knowledge, professionalism, and genuine care for the game."
1/15/2015,"balance is always a tricky thing to accomplish, and players tend to overdo the thing that is optimal because they want to win. i think that it's unhealthy for the game when there is only one right way to do a fleet fight e.g. 'ishtars/tengus online, whomever has the most wins' but it's far easier to heap criticism and less easy to actually balance things correctly. in general, having viable counters for things is helpful, and if it's impossible to economically counter something, then perhaps a nerf is in order or a buff for a potential counter that doesn't currently quite work.i'm waiting to see how the results of the isboxing ban shake out before i make a sweeping statement about bombing runs making doctrines viable/non-viable in 2015. things have changed somewhat since 2014 in that department, and it takes time for doctrines to adapt.asked, and answered. if you have a more specific question i'm happy to elaborate."
1/15/2015,"i can vouch that june is highly motivated to help both new players and older players, and is if not one of the nicest people in eve, (she might be anyways) is one of the people i would most highly trust to be involved in the csm to stay motivated and ight for what she believes in. i can't say i'm going to vote for her, but if you agree with her on the issues you can count on her to fight for what she believes in.june what do you think needs to be done, if anything, to make solo pvp more viable?"
1/15/2015,"so if you get re elected to the csm, what will you advocate for ways to introduce new players to solo and small gang pvp earlier? what would you change if any thing in regards to the way ships are balanced for small gang or solo pvp vs blob warfare?"
1/15/2015,"fair enough - i mistakenly thought i had mentioned the input automation issue as well as the other thing i discussed in the dev blog from yesterday in the op but obviously not. to be clear, from the csm dev blog released by ccp leeloo yesterday:'a couple of things that came slightly out of the blue which i wanted resolved have come to me from the player base since i was elected. the first was the issue of input automation which i very quickly engaged ccp on with initially, limited success. i requested a session to discuss this at length at the summer summit and you can read how that particular conversation went in the summit minutes. it was clear that this urgently needed addressing so it was fantastic to see ccp clarify what was a previously grey area and to feel i personally played a significant part in that.i also wanted to address how ccp devs actively play the game in a very real way after the issue was brought up by a player. after all, how can a dev balance the demands of a large 0.0 bloc fc if they can<U+FFFD>t experience said gameplay themselves? this is something i pointed at ccp rise and fozzie when they came on crossing zebras a few weeks back and i believe ccp will act on this in the not too distant future.'i thought i had mentioned these in my original op in this thread but clearly not - my bad.to be clear, i would need to check logs but i am entirely confident that i was the first person from csm9 to address the input automation issue with ccp early on in our term. i pushed for the session to discuss it at the summit and as you can see from the summer summit minutes, it was something i pushed on heavily during and after. as to being a reporter, i definitely consider that part of my job but not all of it. as listed above, i have achieved real, concrete change as well as being a conduit for the player base.as so being a pl candidate, i am a candidate standing on the csmx election who flies with pl same as manfred sideous and bobmon."
1/15/2015,"vic, let me ask you, if you became a csm how soon will you be lobbying to have your alliance space turned into the ""go to"" area so you and your alliance mates can just sit on gates and generate content all day?b/c after reading all of your ""views"" ""concerns"" and statements, it just appears to me that all you want is more people in your space to shoot at."
1/15/2015,"so i have a couple points to touch on in responding to your post.no matter what i say, some will not be convinced of my intentions simply due to my associations. there is literally nothing i can do to win these votes. some though, will actually judge a candidate's merits or lack theroff, on her or his platform. i would ask that people consider my platform and not immediately jump to 'grr goons'. does the candidates line of reasoning rhyme with your own, is this someone you could trust to empower your voice and concerns? for example there are several candidates focused on hi sec - are they just wanting to improve their private panda hunting reserve and ensure the rules are tilted in their favor, as one would guess from labels and associations, or do they actually want to make it a more interesting place? this is something that you, the voter, get to decide, and use your vote accordingly. do i just stand for sov null stuff?i have spent perhaps the majority of my time in this game in npc null and or low. conflicts here are more engaging and personal to me. i will continue to spend the majority of my time in these areas as i find them the most fun. no security band or playstyle should have the monopoly on content. to that end, i want to empower players that make the choice to revel in the chaos and danger that npc null/low provide, compared to the relative safety of sov null. i don't want to turn any sov area into a one-stop content shop. the more different entities you can get into one area, the more interesting interactions can happen, and you aren't going to get that many entities, especially hostile ones, in the same sov space, at least under the current rules. in short, i want to see low and npc null buffed specifically because you will get more people, more unique groups, in areas where they can actually colonize and interact, rather than populating the relative sterility of the partitioned sov blocks."
1/15/2015,"i've advocated heavily for changes to the highsec corp aggression mechanics, which i suppose you might count. though also, the conceptualization of what might be good or bad for a corporation, alliance, or coalition in terms of game mechanics depends largely on zoom level and time frame. a rising tide lifts all boats, and only the short-sighted or the narrow minded advocate for short term advantage at the expense of the game's ecosystem as a whole."
1/15/2015,"i've updated my second post with a link to marc scaurus' low sec questionnaire, also found here."
1/15/2015,then what do they have jfatigue from?
1/15/2015,so just using titan bridges and jump bridges within delve? if so...have you suggested to people that they use gates for daily travel?
1/15/2015,"indeed i have, unfortunatly people are harder to teach and the fatigue system is not the easiest to understand."
1/15/2015,"well with all due respect to you as a major alliance leader holding 0.0 sov, but i feel as the issue isn't the jump fatigue but rather people's gameplay habits. jump fatigue is what is keeping 0.0 much more divided and conflict driven. why would you want to limit that? what is ""too harsh"" in your mind?"
1/15/2015,"in my mind over a days fatigue is too much. most fights aside from maybe 1-2 in the past 2 years are over in under 24 hours stacking the most fatigue at 1 day is more than enough, why stop people from wanting to login due to not being able to join any fleet in your alliance for 30 days because you made a mistake and find it hard after that mistake not to wait over and up to a week or more."
1/15/2015,"that sort of fatigue limitation, to be quite blunt, is what stops the cfc for example from moving all their supers south of fountain one day, and moving it all back up to venal the next day. on the broad meta aspect of the game, this is exactly what is going to make nullsec a much more diverse multi-faction animal as opposed to the boring polarized version we had come to know for the past year +. if we could have 6-8 cfcs or n3s or rus coalitions out there, the game would be better, and thankfully we're heading toward that direction. your position on the matter not only works 0.0 on a broad level, but against your very own coalition very directly."

1/15/2015,"ok but under what form? every politician wants ""something good to happen"" but what will set you apart is the what and how."
1/15/2015,i will say i'm not a game designer. but i would attempt to draw some of ccp's attention to this if afforded the opportunity.
1/15/2015,"some few will know me, but most of you will not, so i want to introduce myself for you:i'm an ambitious industrialist in highsec, who have fun with 3rd party development also. it's been two years now, that i started to play eve. because of this, i feel near to newbies and their wishes and worries, i think.i have done several things in eve, like mining, missionrunning, some pvp stuff, some short trips to low and nullsec, but my home is highsec.trading, t2/t3 manufacturing in highsec poses and exploration are my focuses. so my priorities are focused on the development in this areas of eve.besides i developed some tools for me using the great api, ccp gave us and working on some public tools for coorporation and industrial management now. this includes an andproid app to monitor your industrial and market activities (wip). so this is a focus for me also. i am curious about all the goodies, coming with crest the next months.we had some big changes in the industrial part last year, but in my opinion this should be only the beginning. ccp is working hard on changes for pos management. something we need since years.all this things and the relationship between them are not that easy to learn for newbies.one of my goals in our corp and besides are to explain them to new players. for this i wrote some tutorials. my last tutorial, i wrote after the industrialchanges, explain how to start with manufacturing and invention for example.new player are a mayor concern of mine, especially if they interested in industry and trading things. there several ideas, i read about to improve the player experiences, especially for players that are not that interested in shooting on others.wardecs and ganking are some of the difficulties, a industrialist have to deal with. i know they're part of eve and this is a good thing, but some of the mechanisms working not that perfect. one thing more, i want to see changed.with your help (and your votes also), we can work on all this to improve the player experience for both, newbies and veterans and we are able to show, that highsec is more than grinding and isk printing and have it's viability, also. ps: english is not my first language, as you might guessed, but this shouldn't be a problem."
1/15/2015,"hello, my dear experienced capsuleers, i am doudou the newbro.[interrupted] but your name is ****!!! riot [/interrupted]no, no. lets make this clear, my name represents cute cats or other cute things in french. i am part of the frenchy invasion currently going on in new eden, and that is why you will vote for me! if that isn't enough, let me share some other good reasons with you.as a completely new player, many things pop out at me as being problematic, or not as accessible as they should be. eve is a complex game, and i like it that way. there is no ""dumbing down"" suggestions that will be encouraged through me, but ""heavy simplification"" is needed, especially in the ui area.==== questions you may have ====why would i vote for you? well probably you wont ^_^ but wouldn't it be awesome that someone with a fresh look on the game be allowed to share and shape this experience.do you understand how much time is needed for csm? yes, as much as we all do. i've read up all i could, and i will be able to put aside the time needed for this project.whats in it for me? well, if you are an experienced player, nothing. haha, that may not be entirely true, but i represent new players with their issues/questions/aspirations. the advanced meta is well enough represented, its time we get fresh looks into the process.==== areas of interest ====- ui- ****** missions- discovery tools (in-game connecting tools)- rookie pvp- high-sec==== goals ====- less windows, better integration of ui and simplicity. ""the game should be complex, the ui should be blissfully simple."" - me- i have a few ideas for missions. currently, the state of generic mission text is outrageous! i want ccp to reach out to the community, to help replace the looping text you get from simple missions. more on this later if you guys want to hear about it :)- as discussed with sugarkyle, eve needs more ways to connect players to different movements (newbro roams), other players (beginner pvp) and interesting events. i will be pushing for this a lot.- all new players start in high-sec. as such, that is the only place i can positively impact.- get ccp to add tools in-game for those already helping out new players!==== what can you expect ====- blatant honesty. i have nothing to hide and always speak my mind.- a lot of non-sense and good times, i play this game to have fun. as such, i believe all systems should be fun.- not enough seriousness. you can find that elsewhere, i have no desire to be boringly serious.- technical knowledge: as a software engineer student, i can have technical discussions with ccp. i understand what they mean when they say it will take longer than you might think. it also means they can't blind me with technical gibberish. win win situation.==== where can you find me ====in-game, i hang out in e-uni a lot. they are a great ressource for new players! if there is enough demand, i'll create a channel and update this post. you can always mail me inside the client with questions/comments/critics. keep it constructive and i will respond.though my twitch channel has been mainly used to stream coding, i will be doing q&a there if people are actually interested in this!twitchyoutubeif i get elected (xd), i'll create a skype for you. i wont create a twitter as i just don't really like that communication system.==== spread the word & final words ====contact a starting friend, tell your beginner corp-mates and don't be shy. new eden needs noobs, we provide a lot of fun for more experienced players, even if that is to our demise ^_^i would like to thank absolutely everyone who has helped me get into this game. from the guys who killed us in a wormhole and then sent us isk, to the helpful players in rookiehelp, to sugarkyle and greygal for showing me what eve is all about and to that fine lady who gave me soooooo much isk on christmas! xd this has been an awesome ride so far, and one thing is 100% certain, there is no problem with eve community and their attitude towards new players.i am doing this for fun, cause someone in e-uni said i should :) lets see how it goes!"

1/16/2015,"as someone that regularly roams into provi to find good fights, i'm loving the jump fatigue limitations on jb's. it has really improved the fights we get from provibloc!"
1/16/2015,"on the other hand, proliferation would not be a problem if supers were balanced in line with all of the other ship classes, so even docking in supers could be feasible as a part of a very large balancing effort that brings supers into the whole rock-paper-scissors thing."
1/16/2015,"supers can already be stored inside a pos. there is an anchorable pos structure already in game, specifically designed to hold an assembled capital: the x-large smanow, the problem is these are very unsecure, as many of the corp roles allow corpmates to **** with the pos: offline the pos, remove the fuel from the pos, take the super out of the sma, etc. there is also the logistical difficulty in boarding the super from the xlsma in a manner that doesn't result in you bumping yourself out of the pos."
1/16/2015,"just tell me where to find you, and i will remove your bounty from you. bring a tissue, and flashlight. safe flying."

1/16/2015,"it is a minority campaign. most mmos dumb down and make killing easier for financial reasons.however, eve is too pvp centric. at some point, the power to the aggressors is going to be too weighted, then when it hits a tipping point; the ""prey"" in the game will cascade out. bit like how coalitions and alliances cascade collapse - only those will be players leaving the game instead."
1/16/2015,your ham fisted blunder-posting in everyone else's csm threads made me want to come here and check yours for extra entertainment value - you did not disappoint. 11/10. the csm is in dire need of people like yourself who clearly have no idea how to play eve.
1/16/2015,thanks for the bump.
1/16/2015,"i'll start by saying i know next to nothing about you outside of seeing the animosity goons have for you in the tmc comment section.so i've read your op, and listened to the podcast. this is what i've come away with about your platform.- stv voting system is corruptible. - vote buying - system gives advantage to large sovnull blocs- csm candidates are allowed to misrepresent themselves- need term limits- rmting is bad- botting is badso it seems pretty safe to say the summation is that you don't like cheating, or things that smack of cheating.from what little i understand of the day to day process of the csm, it's mostly ccp coming to the csm with their own ideas, and asking the csm what they think about them, so they can gauge possible player (customer) reaction to changes. it seems like those ideas are focused on game mechanics, and possibly appearance. if that is what happens, and they don't come to you asking about the csm election process, rmting, or botting, but instead about game mechanics, what kind of experience do you have in game?you seem to take the position that you have no in-game loyalties to any organizations, and at the same time you've been in all parts of the game (i.e. whs, null, fw, hi-sec, etc.). so here are my questions-what experience do you have in what parts of space?what kinds of organizations have you been a part of?have you held positions of responsibility in said organizations, and what were they?are there mechanics you've found through those experiences that you'd like to see fixed, and what are the fixes you'd prefer?do you have any theories, or preferences on how sovnull mechanics should be changed?"
1/16/2015,can you offer any kind of guarantee that if i were to vote for you; that my vote would be more wasted than if i were to simply vote for the leading goon candidate?
1/16/2015,probably because the very concept is so utterly daft they didn't bother to waste the time to write something.
1/16/2015,"-what experience do you have in what parts of space?-i have been in every kind of space at least once, the area of space where i have the least amount of experience is probably wormholes. when i do anything in-game or otherwise and i encounter something t"

1/16/2015,of course i will start spending my 190k for new accounts today so that i can have them set up for voting time.
1/16/2015,"i had absolutely no intention of voting for you anyway, so i can't truly say i am less likely to vote for you now. 'less than zero' works in math as negative numbers, but in the case of voting, unfortunately, you cannot receive less than zero votes. that said, your comment about zarathustra, more commonly known as zoroaster, really goes to show what sort of person you are.zoroaster's many teachings are more accurately described as mythology, not science. unless you have some sort of proof that obesity is really caused by a race of evil humanoids who forcibly interbred with humans, and who are living on the 'inner crust' of the earth under the light of the 'inner sun' burning at the center of the earth, and who can be found by walking through a cave complex that begins in the balmy center of the garden of eden (located at the north pole) and ends in the airy, temperate center of the earth, or that any of his other, less plausible, teachings are true, refrain from calling his teachings scientific.i suppose the same magical thinking is what convinced you that all non-voting players in eve want exactly the same things you want in game and that goons have somehow kept them from voicing their wants and needs. (coincidentally, the assumption that others want/think/need/feel what you want/think/need/feel is called 'projection'.while wikipedia isn't the absolute authority on any give topic, this particular article is rather accurate."
1/16/2015,"the sad part is, not only are you in goonswarm, but you arent agreeing with xenuria, which obviously means you just didnt ""read the op"" are ""asking questions already answered to the most impeccable of standards"", and ""are just disagreeing to keep your firm grip on the csm away from the 'silent majority'"".dont worry xenuria, i'll post for ya so you dont have to waste time with these ""adherents to the status-quo"""
1/16/2015,"i listened to your interview from capstable. there seems to be alot past history with certian members of goons. given that, would you listen to what a member in goons, or the cfc has to stay? the feeling i get from listening to you is theres alot of grrrr goonies just because of what a couple of people that we part of that group has done. a second question for you, do you really feel that in a game that allows scaming, cheating, stealing and backstabbing, that having ccp police yet another aspect of the game is a good thing? i am reffering to your call to reform with the csm. do you think the players themselves can and do keep everyone in check? the current csm 9 is, i think, an example of the players controlling the csm. they all as far as i can tell have done a pretty good job"
1/16/2015,"i would listen to what any player has to say in the context of the csm.goon or not. in terms of reform and policing, i think that if ccp wanted to reverse their decision of impersonation and misrepresentation than i wouldn't have much of a precedent to stand on. that said they likely will not and as such the csm should not be exempt from this policy. you make a great deal of assumptions and leaps of logic for somebody so otherwise eloquent. by the way the psychological term you are looking for is ""proteus effect"", not psychological projection."

1/16/2015,"hey guys, my name is bam stroker and i want to represent all of you on csm x.tl;dr (i think these go better at the top than the bottom) - 6 year eve vet, organiser of eve down under, does a weekly live internet radio show about eve, helped to build the autz into an active community that punches well above its weight, mastermind behind evemeet.com, eve bet marketing duder, foamy-mouthed crazy about getting eve nerds together to foster relationships and generate content, friends with literally everyone. (yes, even you.) i<U+FFFD>m seeking a seat on the csm to use that platform however i can to empower other community builders and special interest groups. community, community, community! also: community.i rolled my first character in 2004 and spent several years in a cycle of unsubbing and resubbing a few times a year until eve finally <U+FFFD>clicked<U+FFFD> for me 2009. i<U+FFFD>ve been playing pretty much daily ever since.since then my in-game journey has taken me from mining and mission running in hisec, to small-gang pvp in syndicate and living in low-end whs to my current home as a line member of an autz corporation in pandemic legion flying in sov.but it<U+FFFD>s the things i<U+FFFD>ve done and am passionate about when i<U+FFFD>m not actually undocked which are why i<U+FFFD>m putting myself forward as a candidate for csm, because as much as i love this stupid game about internet spaceships the thing that really engages me are the people that i share it with.by now the role of the csm and our understanding of it has matured beyond the early days of it naively being treated like some kind of fantastical wish-granting factory: i.e. ""if you vote for me i'll make ccp do x"". we now all better understand the csm<U+FFFD>s role as a stakeholder in the development process and its limitations. that said, it's reasonable to expect that each candidate brings their own particular priorities to the csm and i'm no exception:with apologies to james carville: <U+FFFD>it<U+FFFD>s the community, stupid.<U+FFFD>my platformthe engagement and interconnectedness of the community is as important to the long term health of eve as the resist profile of an ihub, addressing afk cloaking or the distance a capital ship can jump.in-game special interest groups (or as i<U+FFFD>ll call them: <U+FFFD>societies<U+FFFD>) are entities that come together around a particular activity, interest, language, location or external social platform. these are things like npsi communities, incursion communities, lore and rping groups, players from the same city or timezone, forums, twitter etc.these societies have a tremendous impact on the game. they generate content for players to exploit, whether those players are members of the society in question or or just third parties that encounter those groups out in space. beyond in-game content, these societies foster and maintain relationships that keep players engaged and logging in which feeds back into the generation of content.societies are also a boon to the retention of new players, providing many of them with a place to get assistance or mentoring and expose them to the wide variety of experiences that eve has to offer which they simply don<U+FFFD>t find out about from the tutorials. *if* new players know they even exist or how to find them, that is.the biggest problems facing these societies (or would-be societies) right now are a lack of robust administration tools and a complete lack of discoverability within the client.meanwhile, real-life player gatherings are an extension of these in-game societies into the real world and they are an enormous amount of fun and incredibly powerful in solidifying bonds between players. as someone who has either organised or supported countless player gatherings ranging from small pub meetups to major, multi-day events i<U+FFFD>m acutely aware of the challenges faced by people trying to get an endeavor like that off the ground.community often gets overlooked in csm campaigns though because the burning issues that many players are seeking attention for relate to high-profile, single issue mechanics or balance problems (eg. fixing sov, ishtars).the csm shouldn<U+FFFD>t be so myopic though. although those other issues are important, remember that csm x will have 14 members. even if you don<U+FFFD>t get out of bed to vote there<U+FFFD>ll still be predictable mix of representatives from nullsec, lowsec, hisec and whs as well as a couple with special interests like the new player experience or third-party tools.but i need your support to bring a dedicated community focus to the council. i<U+FFFD>ll put community first and will look at matters brought before the csm through the prism of how the community will be affected and advocate for anything practical that will improve the experience of community builders like myself, which in turn will benefit eve players at large.i want more of these societies to emerge, grow and thrive so that more players - whether you<U+FFFD>re actually involved in a society or not - can benefit from the friendships and content that they provide. if you see the value in that too then i humbly ask for your vote in the upcoming election.eve down under - a community for players in the autz"
1/16/2015,"why i<U+FFFD>m running nowi had previously considered running for both csm 8 and 9. in the end i deferred and decided that i wouldn<U+FFFD>t put my hand up until i felt like i had something to offer the csm that nobody else could. i hadn<U+FFFD>t intended to run this year either, but then mangala solaris messed that up.i had read many of the things he<U+FFFD>d posted calling for support for special interest groups in eve and i spoke to him at length about it at eve vegas. mang and i shared many common ideas and concerns for community support and it seemed to me he was the guy to carry it forward in the csm. i could rest easy.but when i found out he wouldn<U+FFFD>t be seeking re-election for csm i knew that i wouldn<U+FFFD>t be able to just relax and let someone else take care of all the work - i had to put my hand up if i wanted to see this important agenda advanced to ccp and so here i am.what i<U+FFFD>ll bring to the csmin real life i work in subnational government, specifically <U+FFFD>non-media communications<U+FFFD>. note the <U+FFFD>non-<U+FFFD> part before media - i<U+FFFD>m not a spin doctor; my job is to articulate and disseminate information to a large body of people and efficiently process the feedback. i<U+FFFD>m also used to working in small teams that require frequent and clear internal communication. i can think of few irl jobs that would have as much relevance to a body like the csm. in addition to my irl skill set, my involvement with eve down under has put me in regular contact with ccp. i have established relationships with many of the developers and already have a respectable understanding of the structure and culture of the company. i have also followed the csm closely for several years and i don<U+FFFD>t expect it to be some kind of special snowflake social club. in fact i anticipate there will a great deal of frustration that accompanies the role, but i<U+FFFD>m prepared for that and will do my utmost to deal with everyone involved - ccp, other members of the council and the players - with grace and respect.eve consumes a lot of my free time and i actually like it that way. i<U+FFFD>ve kept up a constant pace for the last couple of years organising eve down under, handling our social media, attending player gatherings, doing a weekly internet radio show, playing the game itself and working on numerous side projects. people can vote for me with confidence that i<U+FFFD>m not going to give up and go afk or burn out since if that were going to happen it would have already happened well before now.any organisation i've been involved with has been left better off than when i found it. i have a thick skin, play well with others and there's no task - no matter how small or mundane - that i'm too proud to put time and effort into. i will be a hard working, accessible and reliable member of the csm - qualities i have already demonstrated many times through the myriad other projects i've been involved with in eve.some things i<U+FFFD>ve doneeve down under - organiser of what was the largest player-run gathering in the world last year.the eve down under show - a weekly live internet radio show about eve with an autz twist.eve meet - a site to connect people with local player gatherings in their area.eve bet - marketing and promotions guy. it<U+FFFD>s been my pleasure to provide hundreds of billions in ships, plex and isk vouchers to numerous npsi communities, blogs, podcasts and news sites and to shower nerds with swag at player gatherings around the world.appearances on eve tv and (wow) actual tv:eve vegas 2014 - in which i talk a lot about my feelings about community and player gatherings.the o7 show ep 1 - promoting eve down under.eve fanfest 2014 - promoting eve down under and the autz.abc tv<U+FFFD>s good game - includes some clips of me talking about the community during a story they ran on b-r. i also spearheaded the effort to get this segment produced and on the air.in conclusionstorytime: i was at a player gathering in melbourne late last year. it was a big event with about 40 people in attendance and i got talking to a player who i hadn<U+FFFD>t met before. during the the course of our conversation he told me that a few weeks earlier he had cancelled his subs and was just running down the clock because his corp had gone afk and he<U+FFFD>d grown bored. by chance he found out about the meetup while browsing the eve-o forums and decided he might as well come along.he went on to tell me that he<U+FFFD>d just met some guys from a corp that sounded fun and was going to go home, resub and apply to their corp. his story was one of the main inspirations that spurred me to create evemeet.net to enhance the discoverability of irl player gatherings.in some respects the community also functions as a kind of lifeboat providing that extra incentive to encourage people to stick with eve, even when someone<U+FFFD>s going through a rocky phase. its importance cannot be understated and it deserves the attention of at least one csm who is committed to it full-time.i<U+FFFD>ll do my best to answer questions if people have any, but if the main things on your mind are <U+FFFD>how will you fix sov?<U+FFFD> or <U+FFFD>what would you do to balance sentry drones?<U+FFFD> you might be disappointed. :)cheers,bam.feel free to contact me via evemail or @bamstroker on twitter.eve down under - a community for players in the autz"

1/16/2015,"not to be an ass, but a small corp's need for representation is neither equal to nor more important than the right for a massive coalition to have csm representation. that's representation by population, and it's democratic. furthermore, simply by being associated with an alliance or coalition does not invalidate your own credentials nor does it hinder your ability to represent players on the csm. we've seen some of the best csm members in recent history hail from these coalitions.tl;dr - check yourself"

1/16/2015,"honestly, i don't even know what you're trying to say anymore. anyway... if you don't have another question for me, then i'm going to ask you to stick to your own thread.you don't like me, fine. you're not going to vote for me, that's cool too. good luck on your campaign."
1/16/2015,"that's a tough one to answer, because i won't know what the csm and ccp are currently working on until i am elected. it's not my place to demand specific changes that aren't in ccp's roadmap, but to advise on whatever they are trying to design or iterate. however, the one thing i'd want to push first and foremost is a ""little things"" update to channels and mailing lists. simple. to make sure the npsi communities actually have a voice on the csm that represents them. mangala did a great job, but he's not running for re-election and these is still work to be done. lots more work to be done. ccp is going a great job with the module tiericide so far, and i'd be in favour of them simply carrying on with the direction they are currently travelling. specifically, i'd like to see the redundant or simply useless modules removed, while the meta levels of modules standardized. no more m4 > t2 nonsense. i have a lot of favorite videos, and i actually compiled my list into a video showcase a while ago. it can be found here."
1/16/2015,"there are quite a few ways that this could be done, but the way i envision it is rather simple: these ""social groups"" or ""societies"" shouldn't be able own anything as a collective. no pocos, no poss, no offices, no taxes, etc etc. the activities to be encouraged should be purely event and social based, and have nothing to do with building an empire, or competing with other established ""real"" corporations."
1/16/2015,would you ever support an idea for an npsi community to take sov if it was only possible in specific systems designated by ccp? i ask because i remember bombers bar jokingly (or maybe not) trying to take sov in hed-gp. perhaps spectre did this as well... not trying to leave them out.
1/16/2015,"we have tried to take sov before as an npsi group, once seriously, and since then only in playful wargames. i was involved (the instigator, actually) of the hed-gp attempt back in my bombers bar days, as well as the more recent wargames against providence with spectre fleet.in both cases we had zero plan with what we'd do with the system other than freeport it if we actually succeeded.if this were ever to be the case, it would have to involve an alliance holding sov in proxy for an npsi community... i just don't think there is any place in the mechanics for sov to be blended with non-corporate entities. that's not to say i wouldn't love to see an npsi-esque freeport regions such as the big blue or phoebe freeport republic's more recent efforts, but i wouldn't support the ability for npsi groups to take sov, no.that's not to say those communities wouldn't be in favour of helping groups that desire to freeport sov nullsec, as that has already happened and is something that the community is almost universally in support of. which is great, but nothing more official than that is needed imho. some people (usually those on the receiving end of these fleets) have decried the ability for npsi groups to form a full 250 man fleet as being ""overpowered,"" and in a sense, they're correct. if you want to build an empire, join a corp."

1/16/2015,you got my vote. the csm needs people who are able to connect with people and genuinely care about the game.
1/16/2015,"that first question is quite big and a really hard one to answer. i think that faction warfare could be a great starting point for people wanting to do small gang pvp and then branch out into doing solo stuff during downtime/when no one else in your group are online. the problem with solo pvp is that it is a isk sink for 99% of all players and people just don't like losing isk. this could be offset by doing a fw plex to pay for your ship pretty much. i honestly think that the best way and the way most people got into solo pvp was by watching pvp videos like garmonation etc and thinking ""i can do that"". i would want ccp to promote good videos better and they are doing a bit better but there are still more to do. one thing people need to understand with small gang is that you don't need to instantly jump into the endgame orthrus + machariel + snakes and links small gang fleets just to stay competitive. running small cheap gangs such as just a bunch of cruisers with 1 logi or maybe remote rep tristans/vexors is a cheap way to get into pvp and a way to cause a lot of damage. same thing with solo pvp. i really think everyone should do buy 5-100 of a ship and t1 fit it + just go out and fight in faction warfare space. while you will die a lot you will learn what every ship can do and what your ship can do very well. this is a very useful skill that has uses for all types of warfare. i don't think you can force people to go out and solo pvp and i don't think most people really care that their pvp is skill intensive or anything. it's more of a pressing f1 + bullshitting with your friends playing a social game. i do this sometimes because it's relaxing and fun to talk to your friends. if someone doesn't want to solo pvp they probably won't go into it with their full hear and maybe go lose a ship and have no fun at all. the thing is solo pvp isn't very rewarding most of the times. the more experienced you get the more you know what you can and can not attack and this turns roams into endless parts of either no people or people you just can't fight. i don't know if it is the bitter vet in me speaking but you turn more risk averse and then miss those fights where you couldn't win on paper just looking at what they have and what you have but when you actually go and do it you find out that they wasn't perfectly skilled with a perfect fit and you actually came out ontop. and this is where you really get the rewards of solo pvp, killng a bigger fleet or even a single upship kill is so rewarding and you know that it is all you.for small gang pvp it's a matter of finding people that you like to fly with. if they are in anyway good they can be great with some practice/roaming and actually analyzing fits/battles. or if you are a non casual you could just do a ton of research and study all mechanics/spend time in eft, theorycrafting a gang up and have a easier way of getting good. i think the new player experience needs to tell people about mechanics that are obvious to older guys but not really explained at all. maneuvers such as slingshotting, getting under guns, manually piloting in combat and how to fly your ship to apply more damage by matching transversal. these things are easy to learn if you actually spend the time looking up youtube gudies but they are not really explained ingame.so to sum things up: i would like ccp to promote solo/small gang pvp videos more. tell more people about faction warfare and that you don't need 1b ships to win. get people to join a pvp corp that promotes solo/small gang pvp. make everyone understand that solo isn't going to be for everyone in a mmo it is a social game after all. it is also important that the older guys at least teach something to the new guys and accept that they are new and still learning. i will answer the ship balance question tomorrow!"
1/16/2015,i do agree with you to a point. high sec has been stagnate and bloated. there isnt much to offer new lplayers in the ways of successful caimpaigning in low or null unless they are in big fleets that can mask them. but everyone has their own playstyle. rather than take away from one to give to another why not just give the more riskier more reward. let the carebears be carebears if low or null was more enticing to move there more would do so and the players that stay in high sec become greater targets than before making their risk/isk factor go up.
1/16/2015,"i disagree. compare and contrast these two scenarios, though i'll admit they may be idyllically painted due to fond memories of days in barleguet.a)steve stegosaurus decides to play eve online, after hearing so much about it. one of the first things he realizes is that he needs isk to do anything, but being so new, he can't afford to really risk much, and begins grinding missions and isk, maybe even mining. the game of intriguing stories and heated battles seems so foreign, but he grinds in good faith that one day, you know, that one day in the future when he has enough isk and lp, he will venture into dangerous areas. chances are, that day will never come, or he will be ganked or wardecced into extinction, and never really have a good opportunity to learn the game, or enjoy it, unless he really just likes missions. this is currently what the income and risk structure of the game encourages.b)abbie anaconda decides to start playing the game with a few friends, or maybe she was fortunate enough to be recruited by an adventurous veteran who wants to see how far he can get managing a new corp. life seems rough out in low or npc null compared to steve. there aren't many ways to get isk, and predatory players make surviving a challenge. through patience, planning, and persistence, she learns how to stay safe while hunting clone soldiers in groups of frigates. in fact, she has far more fun with a group of friends hunting for clone soldiers than steve had grinding level 1 and 2 missions alone. predatory players have taken notice of these gangs and begin bullying them. eventually abbie's gang assert their dominance and score a few nice kills using only cheap, combined arms frigates against bigger, tii ships; steve is entirely empty handed when it comes to adventure and stories like this. characters and happenings like this are what eve is; i'm sure we all remember 'that one guy' that was the local bully, and treasured the times we came out on top....maybe that was a little hokey, but the idea is sound. more stuff in space that can generate content would be warmly welcomed, in both low and npc null. new players can contribute a lot, and its the best time to learn teamwork."
1/16/2015,"awoxingobviously, people have concerns over this.a)the tool box of the hi sec antagonist is shrinking. it's already too small. there aren't many interesting choices besides suicide ganking. this is a bad thing. b)given the state of hi sec and risk/reward ratios, it is also a step in the entirely wrong direction. if low and null were rebalanced so they actually draw numbers, this wouldn't be as big of a deal. it's another step towards optimizing the high sec trap of complete safety and guaranteed income. if there were more people living in areas without concord, no one would even take a second look about these changes. however,c)to the best of my knowledge, the biggest awoxes have not happened in hi sec. it is completely unfair and disingenuous to saw awoxing has been removed. hi sec antagonists/pirate aspirants who pompously pontificate about risk/reward and yet depend on having such a risk free way of ensuring kills should make you think about its usage. i understand that the rest of the game is a target poor environment, which is why i maintain that fixing other security bands is a real root treatment of several ills plaguing the game - if you want to build a better pirate, you must first build them a better new eden."

1/17/2015,"wow, feeling pretty amped by the outpouring of support and kind words. some even elicited feels i wasn't expecting (gil and inceptor). <3one of (if not *the*) biggest issues that faces someone who is trying to build a society is discoverability. people can't get involved with these player groups or go to a meetup if they don't know they exist and the instigators have to be very, very pro-active - some might say aggressively so - if they're going to succeed at getting the attention of would-be participants.an in-game ""society bazaar"" would be a great start. similar to the corp search tool in the recruitment tab of the corporation window. it would serve as a place for people to advertise their society, detail their particular area of interest and other relevant information such as language, timezone etc. add it to the default icons on the neocom or station services button, too, and direct new players to it as part of the tutorial.out-of-game, the oceanus release last september brought with it two of the most exciting things i've seen added to eve in years: the new notifications beta and the beta opt-in feature itself. most people probably didn't get all that hot and sweaty about them but i saw some great potential there:ccp knows where we all live. they've got our info in their accounts database, their billing system and they see our ip whenever we log in. how amazing would it be if i could notify ccp that i was organising a player gathering and have an in-game notification pushed to all players who lived within, say, 100km of where it was taking place? i think engagement would skyrocket. make it opt-out rather than opt-in, too.there are some issues that present themselves, of course: people would find some reason to be mad that they got the notification in the first place but afterwards they can opt-out and not be notified again. there's the potential for people to make troll events and there might even be some legal liabilities that ccp face if something bad goes down at a meetup which they helped promote, even if they didn't organise themselves. they already promote player-run gatherings of course but maybe there are different implications if they move those endorsements in-client. i don't think any of those are truly insurmountable with careful planning and implementation though.if this all sounds familiar it's because this train of thought is basically what led me to come up with evemeet.net which has been really well received. however nothing would make me happier than if that site became completely redundant because ccp replicated its functionality in the client where it would be so much more powerful.obtaining the dev resources to make things like these would be the biggest challenge i should think, and by now we pretty much all realise that nothing is ever as straight-forward as it seems given eve's tendency to roadblock progress if a project needs to touch on ancient, arcane spaghetti code."
1/17/2015,"bam for csm x!as a player that runs meets, i know how hard it is to get the voice heard.the time is now right for a community csm who represents community needs and values, yes its all fine and well for null/wh/lo/hi to have there csm members, what about when you step away from the client?that last post bam, that should be what you try and get done for this time next year, yes it will take time, but nobody puts a road down without making plans and getting around bumps on the way. now my meets are at the smaller end of the scale, but its been built on a solid foundation. a good number of players know about the glasgow eve meets, but there are still a lot that have never herd about. this can be said for every meet, things are getting better, but this is the time were those that like a drink and a chat face to face leave the keyboard behind."
1/17/2015,"you can find my quizzing by ""just for crits"" here"
1/17/2015,"this is too big a question to fully answer in one post, especially a post made on a tablet. apologies for typos.as i see it there are three main reasons people suffer really, really dumb losses in highsec.1 - a newish player in their first experience with the sandbox.2 - a belief that highsec is safer than it actually is, and in particular a belief that the most dangerous systems in high are safer thanthe lleast dangerous systems in low.3 - a calculation of risk vs reward that says 'yes, losing a dominix in a mission is cheaper than losing a kronos, but the extra isk per hour is worth the risk'. this calculation may be correct or it may be wrong.re 1, i think tutorials that are low stakes but competitive are the way to go here. have a tutorial mission that sends a rookie to deliver a package to an area of space that is probeable and to sit there for two minutes. then have a latter tutorial to probe down and steal that very package from another player. consequences of failure should be minimal, and the rewards of a successful theft high enough that collusion would be the game theoretical correct choice. that will introduce rookies to the sandbox early with minimal consequences and get them used to the idea that highsec is not safe.re 2, this needs both out of game communication, along with more chaos in highsec in general. the other factor is that most rookies' first experience with low is usually to walk into a gate camp, because the most obvious entrances into low are much more dangerous than other entrances. this makes people think low is orders of magnitude more dangerous than high when in fact it is not. (exception of tama, egghelende and a couple others)re 3 - attempting to make an informed risk-reward decision is playing eve properly. sometimes you make the decision wrongly, sometimes you make the highest ev choice but still lose. that's fine.there is more to say on this issue but not on a touch screen."

1/17/2015,cap stable interview:
1/18/2015,i strongly support anything that gives alternative for ship spinning.if i have understood correctly nex store was suppose to replace eve store. this was probably reason why they tried to sell overpriced monocles. no one was thinking that eve store and nex store could coexist with each other both bringing in cash to eve development. later they closed eve store and reopened it with old items gone and with few new items.
1/18/2015,i proposed recently that bowhead could get jump drives with very long jump range. it would replace carrier as long range shopping ship.
1/18/2015,"as much as i love eve, there's always been a 'lack' of something within the game on various different topics, so i'd like to take some time and highlight some stuff i think would be great to attract more players.1.) massive lore events.i know we've had the caroline's star, but that hasn't lead to anywhere as exciting people were expecting it to be (yet). i know many people were excited as to watching the star as patches were released, seeing what happens next. as i cannot see in the future, i can't judge too much on caroline's star, but what i can point out is that many players like this sort of stuff. maybe even drop things in without even alerting anyone, and expect players to find out what's out there (then again, how do i know ccp's already done that?).2.) walking in stations.i know that this has popped up in other forums by other people, but it is something that really could go somewhere. if we look at it from a point of view that other space simulator games are doing similar things like this, then it puts more people onto other games as to eve. i know bittervets have been mocking this idea since it came around, but as there is already a door for a similar feature, it can be optional, and so people who do want to use it can, and those who do not can merely ignore it. also, i don't think it should be massively crazy like 'gambling rooms' and such, but meeting rooms was a good idea. maybe even similar to dust-514's pregame lobby, and hopefully we can even interact with valkyrie pilots as well as mercenaries (i'll get onto that more on my next point). even if the feature serves no 'practical' use, it sure makes a great experience for those who have been wanting it for ages.3.) expand the multi-surface experience (eve, dust and valkyrie).this may be a hard one to accomplish, and maybe even trying to just bring dust and valkyrie to pc instead might help, but an expansion of the already existing chain between the three surfaces would be amazing. when we watch those cool trailers like 'the prophecy' and all that, that's what we want! the reason people turn off of eve after playing the trial is because they expect the game to have features such as those displayed in trailers. now although the trailers are a great way to introduce new players to eve, i know many people would enjoy it if we could experience similar features as displayed in the trailers. my main idea for this is to introduce the ability to walk around capital ships. i'm probably going to get a lot of hate from bittervets for bringing this up, but it would be amazing. referring to the prophecy trailer again, the pre-battle meeting took place in the leviathan. that's what we want. if we could have the ability to have other players of the three different games to be in a 'lobby' of some variety belonging to a capital ship, or maybe any ship of a suitable size. another topic relating to that is to have dust mercs able to interact with players outside of fw. maybe if it's just for alliances, it would be a great length to have alliance vs alliance battles on planets and on the sky, without having to join fw. and maybe even have planetary resources collectible through pi, and in nulsec regions, having to have dust players fight for the sovereignty of a planet on the ground. the possibilities are almost endless with the reaction of different players from the different games.although i can't join csm as i am not old enough, i'd really like to have my voice heard, as this is something a lot of players in the game want. thanks for reading."
1/18/2015,"hello, all.with the recent addition of manual flight, the eve universe expanded greatly. what was before difficult to pull off maneuver-wise is now accomplished with (relative) ease.while i think that the current setup of flight controls is ... okay... i think it can be vastly improved with a few minor changes:here they are:remove limitation on pitch control. currently, when you reach full-vertical up or full-vertical down, you hit a barrier and can no longer change pitch angle. remove this limitation so that you have full 360<U+FFFD> movement in the pitch axis, regardless of orientation.change direction left and direction right keys.currently, these keys change the yaw of your ship. in my opinion, it would make more senses for these keys to adjust roll, and have yaw be controlled by pitch. eample: to turn left, you would roll left and pitch up. (edit) adjust response time for each shipthis one may be difficult to pull off, but it has potential. currently, larger ships respond to key input at the same rate that smaller, faster ships do. in my opinion, ships like frigates should respond almost immediately, whereas ships like mining barges or battleships will be more sluggish.this control sheme makes more sense from a space-flight standpoint, and some users may find it more intuitive to pilot a quick-moving craft in this manner (say, an interceptor)thoughts?"
1/18/2015,"far from simple. i have a vague idea of how eve actually deals with motion of ships, and what you're asking for would require fairly substantial changes to that. (roll isn't actually stored. it's generated from the change vector, for example.)"

1/18/2015,"a couple release cycles back the anomalies and scannable items in space started magically broadcasting their sounds across the system. for instance, when moving your mouse from your overview to your gun/scram/chat areas, it is quite possible for your mouse to be over the location for an extrememly short period of time and trigger the sound. i personally find this sound to be quite irritating and completely unnecessary. when i first encountered this i kept thinking a wire was loose in my headset, somebody had a hot mic, or something worse like motherboard failure.i would imagine the mouseover mechanic would be easy enough to force a .5 second delay on.i would imagine that adding .5 seconds of silence to the beginning of each of those sounds would be even easier.i fully realize and accept that this is not really worthy of being discussed by the csm. i first filed this complaint under bug or appropriate release feedback thread and obviously got nothing. i accept the idea that the audio makes it slightly more immersive, but i don't think a .5 second delay would be detrimental to that. if you want to hear it, you're going to mouse over it intentionally for more than .5 seconds."

1/18/2015,"you seem not to realize why ""social corps"" and other means of wardec-nerfs are necessary.if one is wardecced, he must watch local, mine aligned and so on.however if he does so, he could do the same in lowsec for much higher rewards. i mean what's the point of doing an l4 watching local, when you could do l5 while watching local? so if someone is wardecced, he is better off living in lowsec.now you can say that ""everyone should live in lowsec"", but then openly demand removing of highsec! i doubt anyone would do that seriously and expect the game to survive.the only reason people live in highsec despite wardecs is that wardec-evasion is trivial: stay in npc corps, be in a 1-man corp and just fold corp if decced. or hide and avoid anyone noticing you. each of these methods demand players to not interact with other players, which is both making them quit and prevent others from having content.you need to realize that there is no possible way to move the npc&1-man corp people into wardeccable corps. if you change something, they'll adapt and hide more. if you remove every possible way to remain wardec immune, they just find another game. either way, you won't have them on your killboard.tora sees that and offers a solution: the ""social corp"" would allow players to interact without being insta-decced. at worst case there would be more subscribers to support the game. at best, they form a competent group and opt for being in a ""real"" corp."

1/18/2015,"as someone who has an involved interest in managnig an npsi community, my question to you bam is twofold- how much experience do you have flying with the mainstream npsi communities?- what tools do you feel would be beneficial to social groups that exist solely for in game purposes (specifically spectre fleet esque npsi fleets and incursion communities)?"
1/18/2015,"while my corpmates were discussing the near-inevitable t3 nerfs incoming, someone mentioned that t3s were that powerful because they had to be powerful enough to run wormholes. what is your opinion on this subject? should wormholes be made easier to compensate? left as they are and thus end up harder overall? should a new shipclass be introduced that's fit to run wormholes without overwhelming fleets in k-space?do you think it should be reasonable for a group of 1-month newbros to survive and thrive in a c1 wormhole and slowly work their way up the ladder to a c6? or should surviving in a wormhole require at least 6 months of training and experience in k-space?"
1/18/2015,what features would you like to add to the way standings currently work?
1/18/2015,"one last question for you.how will you respond to the reports of open rebellion in your own channel "" spectre fleet "" requiring you to reset all those who had operator rights and to essentialy control the channel with a iron fist?"
1/18/2015,"i will advocate for reasonable changes. i am not a member of a huge block (i.e. goons, n3, pl, or large lowsec groups like snuff) but i do advocate for small/mid sized gang pvp because that's where the fun is. i also support more artistic content.ishtar blobs = 700+ dps cruisers that can go insanely fast while applying their damage from a safe distance away does not add anything good to the game in my opinion.more clothes + more accessories + hats = get your eve internet spaceship barbie swag on = more burner missions = more challenge and more fun while making decent money, great for all players of various skill sets, not depending on being in a huge alliance with sov.more symbols + backgrounds + more colors in corporation logo making = ( i don't know why this hasn't been done yet)t2 frig logi = more fun in t2 frig comps, not relying on t1 frig/t1 cruiser logi, let there be t2 bantams and t2 inquisitors i do not run to have a shinny patch on my boyscout sash, i run to keep telling ccp to improve their game with suggestions from myself and the player base that is not always heard from."
1/18/2015,
1/19/2015,"i've only recently returned to eve after ccp changed force projection and limited the use of things like isboxer, but i have nearly quit before because of high sec wars (this character is more indy than anything else) so i do sympathise with your points of view. however, i've come to believe that the one thing that holds eve back is that high sec exists at all and the new player experience should be pushing pilots to 0.0 as soon as possible regardless of intended gameplay style. high sec has so many rules - many appearing complicated even to bitter vets (how many wormhole pilots get popped while just nipping to high sec for a skillbook because they don't understand the rules of engagement for high sec?...ok, not many but i have seen it happen.) griefers or whatever you'd like to call them understand, exploit and undermine the rules to good effect and they will be the first to adapt to any changes that get made.if i had made a character right now as an indy character my main concern wouldn't be war decs, it would be suicide ganking (which to me appears to be very much in fashion these days.) so while i sympathise with high sec indy corps that get war decced i also think the solution is simply to move to null, produce local, sell local and rely on players, not concord to defend you."
1/19/2015,"you sir, are a gentleman and a scholar. i strongly approve of every word you wrote.this is exactly the problem with highsec. not surprisingly, player retention is best among those players who get drawn away from highsec one way or another during their first few months.by the way, pve and industry in nullsec and wormholes can be even safer than these activities are in highsec... when players build safety networks of their own, instead of relying on those filthy filthy npc:s. there is a huge difference between built-in securiy and emergent security as far the quality of the game is concerned.death to the npc menace! glory to player-controlled content!"
1/19/2015,"1) massive lore events require a whole lot of dev manhours to write up, manage, run, and ensure ""fairness"" (or in some cases, like the caldari/gallente one a couple years back, ensuring a lack of bias in who they allow to enter, fricking 4:1 gallente:caldari ratio lockout)2) forum has already nuked wis to even receive a single dev team again for the next 10 years, its permanently scrapped3) all 3 games will be completely separate, ccp already stated this as a design goal, like with dust, the most integration you coudl see is the battles in the completely isolated and nearly static/repeating environments of dust/valkyrie changing a percent marker for a structure's hp or a fw system ownership by a couple percent every 100 battles or so. ccp wants all three games to ""stand on their own"", and once they magically dont failscade, think up some last minute ad hoc ""integration"". the most you could hope for is they actually go through with their single-client-sign-on and let you use your character name across all 3 games.(dont get me wrong, the three games imo should all share 1 client from the beginning, only people with an active sub can buy/sell/undock eve assets, but everyone can swap over to valk/legion functionality. the best integration would come from integration as a core design goal. however this is completely opposite what ccp has stated their intentions to be.plus making stations only capturable through dust/legion, with eve being a fight to destruction, would be great, afterall, capturing an important military assets should be levels higher than just destroying it)"
1/19/2015,"i would like to see a push to clean up the forums. a great place for player information both for and from ccp.in some ways i am an ocd person and one of those is online/computer sorting of files.layout thoughts.f&i-stickies-folder/group friagtes-folder/group planetary interaction-folder/group highsec gankingetc.also the introduction of a tag system that would sort your newly created post into the proper group. but why?many of us know that the search function for the forums is not the best or just don't have any luck finding what we are searching for when we use it.""the lord loosed upon them his fierce anger all of his fury and rage. he dispatched against them a band of avenging angels"" - the scriptures, book ii, apocalypse 10:1 #npclivesmatter #freetheboobs"

1/19/2015,"dear core,after reading this thread, i understood why some persons like you could also represent a part of the players.if someone has a real life, a job and a family to deal with... it's a problem that corresponds to all players who love eve but don't have 24 hours per day for this game.it's an important parameter to take in account by ccp. i see you are 42. and how much it can make difference to take decision even in a game.volition cult i see.spirit of game isn't fond of piracy and murdering. that's a important point to represent us.it's campaign so some questions to have an opinion, please.1- what would you propose in csm for new players ?2- what about shares market and opening it so that it can work like a real stock exchange ?3- what about extending anti piracy means even in the core game ?4- what about walking in station extension lobbying ?5- what about project legion lobbying ?6- what about eve valkyrie linked with eve online lobbying ?7- what about solo player style evolutions ?when you will have time, i would be happy to read your answers.best regards."
1/19/2015,"i plan to continue to push the subject and suggest it as a wonderful idea that everyone should love as much as i do. within the csm, as with all ideas and topics it is open to collaboration and opinion by anyone who wishes to join in. i like owning ideas but i am not going to live in a void with a project. with there being so many different play styles on the csm there would be many angles beyond my own personal knowledge cases that would apply."

1/19/2015,"believe it or not, that was a compliment. just using your reddit profile as a crude example: you seem to switch between shitposting wildly and dropping wisdom bombs. one of these doesn't belongs on the csm or in any official interaction with ccp.just sayin'"
1/19/2015,i dont see how my reddit posts are official interactions with ccp. the **** i post on reddit i mostly post to amuse myself and others for upvotes. it's not how i speak on the csm in any official channel.
1/19/2015,"that was exactly was the point i was trying to make originally, but you took the initial quote out of context. essentially, even tho you act that way on reddit - a persona, if you will - doesn't mean that you're going to act that way on the csm or when talking to ccp about important matters. you know what you're talking about, and you know when you need to be serious. this is essentially what i was being accused of: being unable to separate my in game persona and conduct myself professionally if i were to be elected to the csm.it wasn't even remotely intended as a slight against you. the mynnna analogy was meant in the same way - just because he's a part of the cfc doesn't mean that he's unable to speak for players outside of his own coalition, or that he'll use his position on the csm to forward his coalition's goals in game and nothing more. they're two completely different things, full stop."
1/19/2015,yet another awesome trailer
1/19/2015,well hello there!my name is lanctharus onzo and i am one of the co-host and writers of the cap stable podcast.in early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10.here is our announcement:
1/19/2015,"a few questions for youwhat's your opinion on the recon changes, are they good for the health of the game?do you think ccp needs to look at lowsec pvp not just hisec?lastly, you seem to be trying to be too much, don't you think that a more focused platform may get you more support. are you trying too hard to appeal to everyone."
1/19/2015,"i was beginning to feel a bit lonely here... thanks for the questions....like everything new in eve, these changes garner attention that will dip after a while. in a few weeks you can be sure that most medium plexes you warp to won't have half a dozen recons on grid with instalocking tackle waiting for you in general i like the idea that ccp is willing to think of completely new mechanics and ways to use a ship, on the whole i like the changes, however it is a little op at the moment. ccp intended to differentiate the the combat recons from their cloaky brothers and this definitely fits the bill in that regard. the cloaky force recons have less tank, but have the ability to decloak right next to a target and lock him down once the targeting delay is done. combat recons have more tank and gank (i would argue too much in fact) and dscan immunity but lack the covert cyno capabilities of their counterparts. both are effectively invisible, its just that one has to decloak to take acceleration gates or if it gets too close to an uncloaked ship or object and the other is invisible to you until you get on grid (unless you have probes), would it balance more if for combat recons their immunity to dscan was affected by their proximity to non immune objects or the beacons in fw plexes just like cloaks? unlike with cloaking there would be no visual indication that the recons were now visible unless they scanned periodically themselves. just an idea.i think that ccp needs to take a holistic approach to the game. giving focus on one area or making changes without considering other aspects of the game is bad. this is why i feel that you need not just specialist candidates, but candidates who are more generalised running for csm to make sure that changes are considered from as many angles as possible and to give as many points of view as possible from an informed perspective.on the whole lowsec has undergone a vast improvement in the past few years with the fw changes, gate gun mechanics changes etc. but it could be better and there are lots of with things you can point to and say 'can we fix this', like off grid boosting (and most of these issues affect multiple areas of space). theres always room for improvement. in my experience, lowsec is a generally great place to go roam solo or in a small gang and get mostly good fights, sure you get the occasional problem of fighters assigned to an interceptor camping a gate or a more recently groups of recons sat in a medium or large plex but on the whole its great fun. i would love to see more pathways into lowsec and other areas of the game for newer players as well.i have a diverse platform for a reason, i play in lots of areas of the game as i mention in my thread. i'm not only a hisec guy, a lowsec guy or an industrialist or a miner, pvp'er, pve'er etc. i'm all these things because i get a kick out of trying different things. in my real life i work in an industry that craves specialists however i've carved out a niche where my passion for knowledge of all aspects of a subject are valued and i feel that i can bring that to my term as a csm. so i'm not trying to be all things to all people, i'm just showing the broad nature of my playstyle."

1/19/2015,"i<U+FFFD>m dave korhal: miner, repper, bomber, writer, newbro and csm candidate.a day after i made my account, i sold everything i had and moved to join hero in catch just as they finished taking the region a half-year ago. since then, i<U+FFFD>ve lived my entire time in eve in nullsec, dipping my toes in everything from building fuel blocks from scratch to scouting to fcing repair stratops. i<U+FFFD>m not a leader in brave, i<U+FFFD>m a roadie: one of the many people working behind-the-scenes making sure all the little things are running smoothly. i<U+FFFD>m the squaddie trying to understand how sov mechanics work. i<U+FFFD>m the newcomer asking hero<U+FFFD>s veterans why eve politics are the way they currently are. i<U+FFFD>m the pilot running darting around in an interceptor or bomber for whom supers are the stuff of dreams and nightmares. i<U+FFFD>m not experienced yet, but i<U+FFFD>m learning. and what i learn, i write down: articles about my first four weeks in eve, plus guides to newbros younger than me about topics such as sov mechanics and the calculations of shooting poses.i want to serve on the csm because for all the talk of the new player experience, ccp should have a new player on board to elaborate on what he found confusing and frustrating. my experience is fresh, compared to most of the veterans whose memories of their time as newbros is several years (and patches) old. i want to ensure there<U+FFFD>s places for new alliances in nullsec and a better new player experience, like some other candidates running, but i want to focus most on something vital to both: making it easier to use and understand eve<U+FFFD>s advanced features, like sov mechanics, planetary interaction, the overview, and the combat log. too often, we have to look up external sources for information that should be available in-game, or fight the interface itself to do what we want to do.some of them, like setting up planetary interaction chains, require a lot of manual busywork that should be automatically done for the player. others, like optimal sov blockade unit use, involve so many bugs and exploits that even the players who understand them get twitchy at the hoops they have to jump through. (<U+FFFD>you have to shoot it to secure it. how does that even make sense?!<U+FFFD>) and a few, like the autopilot <U+FFFD>feature<U+FFFD> or sell orders defaulting to the highest buy order, are downright dangerous.these do not add to the interesting complexity or risks in eve, they<U+FFFD>re the jank we have to trudge through to get stuff working and reach the good parts. it<U+FFFD>s frustrating for newbros to understand and a hassle for veterans to check off all the steps. the quality-of-life changes ccp has made in the recent patches have been a good start, but i want them expanded. i want to minimize how many frustrations and annoyances we blame on ccplease.such changes benefit newbro and veteran alike, making eve a more active and vibrant game. we stand on the verge of some of the biggest changes to grace eve in its history, changes we hope reverse the stagnation that has seeped into eve the past few years. i want to make sure we not only focus on the large problems, but also the smaller ones that slip through the cracks to frustrate many of us daily. that<U+FFFD>s why i<U+FFFD>m running for csm."

1/20/2015,"can we have a csm 9 townhall please before fanfest in march ?topics could range from completed personal projects to ccp integrating the csm feedback in the new and faster 6 week release cycle regards, a freelancer"
1/20/2015,"i just took a second look through your main post. i like your general idea for the most part, though i have a few disagreements with it. firstly, i feel that the high amount of nullsec representation has actually been very good for the game. i have followed some of those candidates and watched carefully what they were pushing for, and have seen some of the best changes in eve come out of csm 6, 7, and 8. they very much broke the stereotype again and again, and pushed for changes that benefited everyone. a lot of people still hate the mittani but i remain convinced he is the best csm representative we've ever had.secondly i feel that your views on the ease of gankers staying safe is a little exaggerated. i think perhaps you miss a lot of the work they do to maintain that safety, and don't see when it fails. i've been on both ends quite a bit and i must say that the prey tend to have it easier in eve. however, i am not at all without sympathy for them, especially newer players, as many of them still do not understand how to detect threats let alone run from them. so i would agree with a push toward giving people more tools to defend themselves, and especially toward giving new players more and better education on how to access those tools. but ultimately there's still going to be bloodshed and hurt feelings, and i'm more than okay with that, i love it.i have to side with malcanis, what he said a few posts above about your campaign. he put it more bluntly than i would have, but he is also a lot more educated on the subject than i am. also, he makes an excellent point that if you wish to get votes, you have to campaign in a way that makes you as friendly as possible."
1/20/2015,"as ever, your posts are solid and well written. thank you.right, to the meat of it then. we disagree on our opinion of mittens. i see him as detrimental to eve over all. so, i hold him up as an example of where i feel null alliances and coaltions vote blindly for the candidate that they feel is representing their ""constituency"". i like some of the things sion has to say for himself. i am not blindly going, ""grr goons,"" despite the perception people may have.the unhealthy factor comes from where the representatives, ""live."" i am not a particularly good candidate, because it has been some time since i lived in high sec or worm holes and i think low sec is a really strange case of being neither fish nor fowl. there have been changes to analysing and hacking sites, which i have not kept up with since i stopped being in a worm holes, changes that i don't experience and so fall outside of my notice or don't impact me directly, so i won't become so impassioned by them.as much as we can argue for the mind and personality behind a candidate, their perceptions are still skewed by where they ""live."" there needs to be a balance of representation.ideas that might impact worm holes for example, need more than one voice. corbexx for example comes from a large alliance in whs. if there was a representative from a small wh corp, there might have been a stronger stance against d-scan immunity during the concept stages.i am not so much trying to stop ganking, as i am trying to push for ways that the victims can counter ambush or stand up against the gankers instead of running. add another layer to this aspect of game play.maybe we need a general guide for newbies that they will have access to when they start the game that: gives them an idea of good fits, e.g. do not dual tank. ways to detect danger and avoid being killed. videos demonstrating some situations. the benefits of joining a good corp / alliance. an idea of what to expect in low sec, null and whs. i will say though; the rage against multi-boxers and now afk miners has killed an aspect of game play. the low isk rewards of cheap ores in high-sec did not matter, when you could do other things, like check your corp forum, chat on team speak, share links, check your e-mails, get some work done from home.you could still be in touch with the game and yet get some other things done, while earning some isk.now, it has become one of the lowest paid routes (yes, even in null (capped income rate)) while, being as big a nuisance, as trying to get some ratting done."
1/20/2015,"correct me if i'm wrong, but it seems that the income from mining has gone up significantly over the years, and i mean after correcting for inflation.see now this is an idea i can get behind. it has always bothered me that mining ships are so one-sided. they should be given the tools to fight back, even if fitting for combat reduces their mining output. that's a choice to let the player make, not one that should be forced upon them.all too often i hear people say the procurer is what i want, because it has a lot of hit points and damage. well it doesn't have a lot of slots, it has zero utility highs, and it doesn't have much powergrid. you can't fit an active tank to a procurer, you can't fit neuts. it's stuck with its super-drones as a freebie for people who are just going to afk mine and hope that anything attacking them will die before they come back.you know what i'd like to see on mining ships? utility highs with unbonused missiles, instead of or along with drones! with the right balance, it can be slightly weaker than a normal combat ship when fit with mixed turrets and launchers (extra cargo space meets lack of powergrid) or when fit for mining it still has a significant power to fight back. and the beauty of unbonused launcher hardpoints is how easily you can instead fit a cloaking device, probe launcher, or capacitor mod in them.and that still offers an advantage to miners who are busy with things at or near the computer than those who do not monitor at all, because the ones within earshot and only managing one mining ship can jump into action when combat starts and let their missiles or neuts pick up where the drones left off.i just feel that a big part of why miners feel powerless is because their ships are powerless."
1/20/2015,"quoting you to the op. another stellar post. thank you.--------- from here because it will probably be lost in the depths of that threadnaught, i can not agree more with the sentiment expressed."
1/20/2015,"my favorite idea for fixing the threat of afk-cloaking is setting limits on how many ships can come through a single cyno and/or time delays on ships coming through or lighting another cyno, to make hotdrops smaller and/or slower. still a threat but less of a omg its omegafleet they instablapped my tanked carrier!!!"
1/20/2015,i agree there is something wrong that null sec holds the majority of csm seats.this is the first time i have noticed your thread. although ... your methods are ... interesting. here is a bump. at least we agree there is something wrong with the voting mechanism.
1/20/2015,"if you're a power-block fc it doesn't matter so many people know you that you'll probably get more votes then some no name highsec carebear. limiting free speech for the voting process doesn't work very well either fyi. you also need to remember the csm are not the decision makers, ccp is."
1/20/2015,"i think you're both getting hung up on where the candidates came from and failing to notice that the nullsec candidates have been remarkably reliable in advocating changes all over eve. there is clearly no great conspiracy here, and few of the nullsec candidates including none of the ones anybody including the csm takes seriously are even pushing for changes that would directly benefit anyone in nullsec. furthermore, even if the nullsec candidates were ruthless and were taking the seats only for self/blue-serving reasons, they still would be advocating changes that would help their own specific nullsec group while trying to hurt another specific nullsec group, without caring who outside of nullsec is affected in what way.one thing is doubly certain: the nullsec candidates are no enemy to anyone outside of nullsec--unless you consider providence to not be nullsec."
1/20/2015,"big groups capable of voting in their candidate by majority popular vote? democracy working like its supposed to? oh no, whatever shall we do.if you dont like who gets elected, vote for the other guys next time, if you still dont ""win"" then obviously the people you have a taste for arent what a majority of the players who give enough of a damn about eve to vote want."
1/20/2015,at no point did i question the work done by these candidates.i retain however that the system in it's present form is unfair.
1/20/2015,"you posit that it is unfair and you back it up with speculation. well statistics say it is fair. the happiness of the eve playerbase with the csm shows it is fair. the effectiveness of the csm and the diversity in their moves show it is fair.your logic is not flawed. what is flawed is your perception of the way other people think. there is definitely room for people to take advantage of the csm in a bad way, it is very much a theoretical possibility. but it hasn't happened yet and apparently isn't about to. you're wasting your breath trying to fight a theoretical menace when, statistically speaking, you getting your way is more likely to cause a negative disturbance than a positive one, even if the net potential for disruption is reduced."
1/20/2015,then shouldn't you take this up with the developer. as they are the ones who construed this way of doing the votes. being on the csm cant fix that. as the csm do not fix anything. want to find all the podcasts around eve online visit

1/20/2015,"i was introduced to npsi communities a couple of years ago by greygal when i began participating in agony<U+FFFD>s public roams. later when she left agony and founded redemption road i was involved early on helping to promote her autz fleets and would occasionally fc them.although it<U+FFFD>s been some time since i<U+FFFD>ve done any actual fcing for rr i still go on their public roams whenever i can. in fact i flew in their 100th anniversary roam just yesterday (rip dickslapper 2000. :( gf hero, i hope you enjoy the complimentary signed copy of my book). i<U+FFFD>d say i participate in 2 - 3 npsi fleets each month (not always on my main).i<U+FFFD>ve never flown with spectre or rvb but i can attest to having lost several ships to the latter while they<U+FFFD>ve been out on their ganked roams. bastards.right now a chat channel and a mailing list is the extent of services the client provides to someone running a society. that<U+FFFD>s clearly not sufficient when you realise that societies (which includes npsi communities) are often more complex organisms than many corporations.since you<U+FFFD>re mostly concerned with npsi communities i<U+FFFD>d say the main thing is standings. if societies were a formalised entity within the game an npsi community should be able to set their own standings to other societies and corporations. whenever a player joins an npsi fleet the player<U+FFFD>s standings would be temporarily overridden by the standings of the fleet commander. as well as now making them true npsi fleets it would also be hugely useful when two or more npsi communities are cooperating temporarily, such as recently when spectre and rvb formed up like voltron to kill nashh kadavr<U+FFFD>s titan.it would also be really cool if killmails reflected that a ship was destroyed by an npsi fleet, similar to the <U+FFFD>killed on behalf of<U+FFFD><U+FFFD> message that appears on kms generated after a kill right was used. <U+FFFD>killed by spectre fleet<U+FFFD> or <U+FFFD>killed by bombers bar<U+FFFD> at the top of an npsi fleet<U+FFFD>s km would be really cool, and people would know who was truly behind it when the km gets passed around.while we<U+FFFD>re on fleets, stop the client from treating the fleet window as just another chat window. let fcs save and reload motds or fill out a pro-forma message when they create a fleet. let the fc set up the motd so it displays the fleet comp to all members if he wishes and his requirements for hulls which updates dynamically as people join or leave a fleet. this way someone coming into an fleet can see what they need to get in at a glance without bugging the fc or xo for the 15th time on comms or waiting for someone to answer them in chat.*finally, to give you an example of when i<U+FFFD>ve spoken up for npsi communities before:when i was at fanfest last year i attended the nullsec roundtable and during the discussion ex-ccp greyscale floated the possibility of removing fleet warp. reactions around the room ranged from dismay to indifference to approval. when i spoke i told greyscale that i felt it would have a serious negative impact npsi fleets since they rely on the fc being able to warp the fleet to his tactical bookmarks. corp bookmarks are no help since by their nature npsi fleets attract random people from all over. i said if they must remove fleet warp at least add some other functionality so that npsi fleets don<U+FFFD>t become a nightmare to shepherd, such as allowing fcs to broadcast bms to their fleet so that fleet members can warp to his tacticals manually.now nothing i said at the roundtable was actually that revolutionary. the point is that when greyscale put the idea to the floor the other guys in the room began thinking about the impact on their own organisations. my first reaction was to ask myself <U+FFFD>how will this affect others?<U+FFFD>that<U+FFFD>s the attitude i want to take to the csm meeting table and not just a fanfest roundtable.* to be fair that would be a great help to everyone, not just npsi communities."
1/20/2015,"hi,i have known bam stroker for...ages. this man has put his heart and soul into the eve community.an anecdote:last year there was a brisbane meetup (it was fawlty7's birthday i believe). i was lucky enough to host bam at my home for the weekend. the meetup was a massive success, with a little under 40 amazing spaceship nerds attending. a good time was had by all.afterward we got home, bam stepped outside ""for a smoke"". what he was actually doing was having a little bit of a vomit, on my back lawn.i found this puddle of joy the next afternoon, long after bam had boarded a plane home. since then i have fenced this hallowed ground off and crafted a small shrine. the plant life has flourished, creating a small but vibrant ""garden of bam"". every time i am feeling down or sad i go and sit before the ""garden of bam"", basking in its peacefulness and splendor.i believe that bam will provide a unique and valuable perspective on the csm. his dedication to the eve community is unparalleled. and he's just an all around good bloke.bam, you have my axe, my heart, and my votes."
1/20/2015,"bam is probably one the most enthusiastic people around when it comes to eve, in and out of game.given how much time he has devoted to participating and organising community events, i am confident he would be a capable and productive csm member.will not hesitate to vote for him."
1/20/2015,"toting my own horn here in order to serve the mighty bam stroker.eve meet is amazing, every second i was working on it, i had a nervous jitter. to the point where i put that many hours in with 3am coding binges that i drove myself to the flu (its summer here....).i wasn't putting the hours in because i love eve (which i do), i wasn't putting the hours in because i love the community (which i do) but because of the zeal and enthusiasm which bam had for the community and the future he saw for it.and every moment i spent on eve meet, i saw it too, and every moment was worth it.even now, i've begun work on some projects of my own thanks to bam's gentle push.so vote for bam, his passion for the community might be downright dangerous for your own health! but you'll love every second of it....also www.evemeet.net"
1/20/2015,"bam has a rock solid track record in the community already, it's impossible to go wrong with him on the csm. i'll go one step further: it'd be downright silly to not include this man on your ballot. a definite asset to the csm."
1/20/2015,"hey m8r,i've trawled through my eve bet inbox and i can't find the email you're referring to. could you possibly copy/paste it into an evemail and send it to me along with your own email address and i'll reply to that.[edit] i'll send you an evemail as well just in case you miss this reply. o/eve down under - a community for players in the autz"
1/20/2015,thanks for posting this ariel because eve meet is an example of something that massively backs up the rationale of my platform:it was at a player gathering (in brisbane) that i first met ariel and it was another player gathering (eve down under) when i put out a call to find someone help me develop the idea i had which led to eve meet.it's reasonable to say that eve meet may not exist today if it weren't for the fact that the autz has been a hotbed of community activity over the last couple of years. who knows what other cool things will grow out of relationships forged at these kinds of events and in-game societies if they're given more attention and support.eve down under - a community for players in the autz

1/20/2015,"corbexx, i did the eve vote match 2.1 and it listed you as my top pick at 91%! i went through your responses and saw a lot of things i like, but i did have a few questions. now keep in mind these are neither loaded nor come with any significant experience on my part. please answer them with the assumption that i don't know what i'm talking about and am here to learn.1.) when you say you feel that wormhole space doesn't need any ice or moon materials, is that to force players to maintain supply routes with known space in order to have big things? or perhaps you just don't like them being entirely self-sufficient?2.) you say you're interested in content harder than wormhole class 6. what does it even take to run class 6 sites? i haven't been above class 3. are capital ships necessary for class 6?3.) you say you'd like to see more wormhole effects, but not more systems? do you feel that the wormhole population is about right or too low, and that it will stay low enough in the coming years even considering for a growing playerbase and possibly an increase in the percentage of players in wormhole space? as for effects, any ideas? (i'm curious on the specifics for wormhole effect ideas, i like playing with numbers)4.) do you really think it's okay to give players immediate info on market orders through api?i was toying with an idea and want some input: what if some new wormhole systems were added which are ""deeper"" than regular wormhole systems in that they only connect either with each other or to other wormhole systems, but never directly to known space. these systems could boast more self-sustainability with reduced value of random sites, for those who like less traffic in their systems.in response to your campaign post:i don't have any complaints, you seem to be a guy who will get things done. but since you speak of pos balance, i'm wondering if you are going to push for improvement to pos gunning? it seems like an unused part of the game."
1/20/2015,"just to point out, that vote match is from last year's candidate pool. i assume most of corbexx's responses are still relevant though.founder of violet squadron, a small gang npsi community! mail me for more information."
1/20/2015,"going to tack on one more question to my pile:while debating ways to introduce hisec newbros to the many other different types of space, i realized wormholes make an easy way to visit losec, nullsec, or w-space without straying too far from your hisec homebase or moving your stuff. however, the current tutorials (unless they made changes i'm unaware of) don't cover wormholes at all. as such, i suspect many newbros see wormholes (not just w-space, but wormholes to anywhere) as dangerous, endgame things rather than useful shortcuts to interesting places.how would you get most new players to start exploring/using wormholes within 3-4 days of starting eve?"
1/20/2015,"i'll tell you why i don't run incursions. sure, they give me more than ten times the income of any other activity i can find to do in eve (and that is absolutely not an exaggeration), but they also remind me too much of games like wow. whether you live or die is a careful balance of applied resistance, dps, and reps. it looks difficult until you do it, then once you know you can and you know how, it's just too easy. it's not fun. in fact it's so un-fun that i'm about as likely to run incursions as i am to mine. mining may pay a lot less, but it's a lot less taxing, too. incursion running is like mining 23.5 hours per hour, and pays about the same, too.does it have risk? no. do i need a risk metric to calculate that? no. its risk level wouldn't register a peep on any metric i can think of. even the increased risk of being ganked because your ship has expensive mods on it is still mitigated by how fast you earn back the value of the ship. (was 3 hours for my navy mega running vanguards, about 5 hours for the nightmare with a lower rate of activity running assaults.)i have to agree with two step here, in that highsec incursions pay way too much. i think the best solution would be to dramatically reduce the income from those sites (in highsec) and then also significantly reduce the difficulty while also adding a lot more randomness. it doesn't make any sense to me that you should need something over the 500 million isk mark to compete in highsec. low and nullsec incursions might as well have the same base difficulty as highsec because they have so many other dangers to consider--but adding randomness will only hit highsec incursions hard. lowsec and nullsec incursions might actually benefit from it, provided the logi margins were a bit larger to compensate.i have to offer a disclaimer in that i have not tried running faction warfare sites in lowsec. people say they make more than incursion runners doing that, and they do it in warp-stabbed frigates. if that's true, then that's completely absurd income. way too high. you might be able to make that kind of isk in nullsec or wormhole space with the help of a well-organized conglomerate of people who have to work to guard sovereignty for your access to such things, but you're not going to do it with a ragtag band of ten, and you're certainly not going to do it alone.i'll end this tirade with the accusation that the reason nobody can sort out the risk*work/reward ratio of highsec incursions or faction warfare sites is that one is so small next to the other as to be invisible."
1/20/2015,what is your position on the jump fatigue mechanic? do you think they need to be changed?
1/20/2015,"if by changed you mean removed and put back the way it was? noif you are asking if i think that any arbitrarily selected number or system can stand examination for iteration? yes and probably should be checked for usage and effects.i was, and still am, in favour of the changes to power projection (teleportation) but am willing to discusss the nbuances and levels within that framework.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
1/20/2015,"i always felt that one of the major problems with the old jump mechanics was that alliances would set up specific jump points and have them carefully planned out at maximum jump distances, which forced players to learn jump drive calibration 5 merely to even be allowed into capital fleets. that skill is useless in combat but can save a fleet perhaps one jump to get to the combat. with the force projection nerfs, i don't think this issue is any different. as i understand it, it is still important for ships to have the maximum jump range in order to get as much distance per jump as possible, because of the way fatigue multiplies with each jump. a larger number of smaller jumps takes longer to reach the same distance.i've always felt that the jump mechanics should be built in such a way as to allow pilots with lower levels of jump drive calibration (or none at all) to be viable in capital fleets, and removing the skill or changing its bonus to something other than jump range is not a way i would go about making the change. i had the idea that perhaps if it were balanced such that the only disadvantage to a lower jdc level is a bit more logistics effort, with no time, fuel or fatigue penalties for making more jumps across the same distance, then we would see a greater prevalence of capital fleets accepting lower-skilled pilots--perhaps even advocating training into capital gunnery/drones/rr skills first, and eating the organizational aspect in order to wind up with a more potent fleet. especially large capital fleets could fly 2-3 capital segments at different intervals to provide incentive for eventually training jdc, and to ease the organizational stress a bit. small capital fleets could select intervals based on the lowest jdc skill in the group.any thoughts on the issue i mentioned or my solution/do you think it would work as intended? do you feel this is even a problem? do you have any alternate solutions?i realize i might be barking up the wrong tree here. if you feel you aren't ready to tackle the question, please point me to a nullsec candidate who might have experience better suited to it. i don't know the current nullsec candidates very well. (i'm not even sure who they are except for xander phoena i think.)"
1/20/2015,"dear mike,if you are a casual gamer living in high sec, with a solo player style and dealing with a wife to be able to play, i am sure you can represent a lot of us.it's campaign, so some questions to have an opinion, please.1- what about shares market and opening it so that it can work like a real stock exchange ?2- what about extending anti piracy means even in the core game ?3- what about walking in station extension lobbying ?4- what about project legion lobbying ?5- what about eve valkyrie linked with eve online lobbying ?when you will have time, i would be happy to read your answers.best regards."
1/20/2015,"this is essentially impossible to directly enforce via game mechanics with eve structured as it is. you would first need to remove alts, or at least have some game mechanic that enforced accountability across alt accounts. without that, any debt/assurance transaction that is not based on personal trust is laughable."
1/20/2015,"i absolutely agree, except that i also think there are a fair few in this game who have a somewhat similar negative experience in highsec and believe it to be much more dangerous than it is. so i think the problem is that rookies see lowsec as orders of magnitude more dangerous than they see highsec, while in both cases either one is orders of magnitude safer when you understand the basic dynamics and how to defend yourself. with the danger level in both perceived by rookies, it seems completely reasonable to stay in highsec. going to lowsec appears to be suicide. but if you were to see the danger in both as so much lower than a rookie sees it, while the proportions are similar, it makes lowsec available to take a look at. highsec being safer at that point won't stop people from going into lowsec because lowsec is safe enough.so what i'm trying to say is that lowsec really is orders of magnitude more dangerous than highsec but not that going into lowsec is suicide, rather that being in highsec is amazingly safe when you play your cards right while in lowsec there is still a lurking danger in the unknown factors. i know highsec is extremely safe because i've played around with many of its so-called dangers and even marmite (the only one to ever put up a fight) is still a ghost when you simply avoid the tiny slice of highsec in which they operate. but it doesn't matter how many times more dangerous lowsec is, all that matters is that lowsec is safe enough to be worth going into. that's all that rookies need to see."
1/20/2015,"i don't see that mattering much, as people will just false-flag themselves so often that noone will believe the flag anyway."
1/20/2015,"the thing is, highsec isn't one unified block of space, and neither is lowsec.tama and fasse are both lowsec systems. one is the only lowsec system i'm nervous to fly through in an interceptor if i'm in my learning clone. the other is so empty that i've hauled a billion through it with 5 minute old scout intel.uedama and vylade are both highsec systems, and both are on trade routes. one is a quite safe system, the other, very dangerous. i would *always* take considerably more precautions moving valuables through uedama than through fasse.the real danger in lowsec is entering it. if you know how to enter lowsec safely (i.e. avoid the most obvious gates) it's often safer than the dangerous parts of high."
1/20/2015,"lucky me, i happen to be familiar with all of the systems you mentioned! :dyou're ignoring the bigger point which is that fasse is a useless system. nobody in there cause there's nothing to do. even exploration turns up nothing. no stations to make mining useful. it's too close to better systems and it's a dead end. you couldn't use it as an alternate route for hauling even if you wanted to.but uedama isn't dangerous. it can be tricky for people hauling large-value cargo in industrial ships but you merely need to understand the way gank gambling works. you can very much fly a suitable amount of value between amarr/jita and dodixie/rens and not get so much as a dirty glance from gankers.now i'd love to keep up this debate but we can move it someplace else if you like. more on topic, i definitely support more transparency in the system to make it easier for new players to see the real risk, helping to dispel the paralyzing rumors and instincts that keep them out of a fulfilling time playing eve."
1/20/2015,"perhaps! probably, actually, which would be hilarious itself. but i was thinking of its benefit to allies, namely to get a quick headcount of who's awake in corp, alliance, or standing fleet. i know plenty of players that like to stay logged into the game for various reasons, but finding out whether someone's awake, or how many people in standing fleet are actually active, is often annoying, especially when you're trying to get ahold of someone very busy and can't tell whether they have to finish up a few things before getting back to you or are actually afk/sleeping.the opportunities for false-flag abuse are just icing on the cake."
1/20/2015,"what i'm pointing out, however, still holds.fasse is indeed a very low value system, with its only strategic value being as a way to get orcas or freighters full of ice and ore out of the highsec island next door, or (less importantly) as a place to hunt for mordrus spawns. but a large number of rookies would consider it 'very dangerous' because it's lowsec - you even get a warning before jumping in asking 'are you certain? this system is very dangerous...'it's very much less dangerous than uedama, even though the highsec combat rules offer a player seeking to avoid starship combat more of an advantage in uedama than they would have in fasse. of course a dilligent player isn't at much risk in uedama either. the key thing is that there exist tools to provide warning as to the fact that fasse is the less dangerous of the two systems, but these are not really taught to new players in the game client. you need to ask around and be told to check your starmap for player ship kills, podkills, and (less importantly but it can still be useful) npc ship kills.managing expectations of safety in highsec is, as much as anything else, about teaching people to use those tools."
1/20/2015,"that benefit you mention is legitimate and something i hadn't considered as i tend to handle that afk checking in different ways. i would be in favor of an afk flag in corp or alliance. for local, i see little merit either way."
1/20/2015,"i'd still consider fasse more dangerous than uedama because my tanked cruiser is less likely to be shot in uedama where it is so far outside of any potential profit margin, but uedama is definitely more dangerous to take anything of value. i just find it easy to get by without taking valuable cargo through places like uedama, at least now that i know how to avoid those places and where they are (mostly).as for the afk in local, i think it would only be useful for alliance intel if it were a default setting that happened automatically. either way, it would still be used for pvp and would unfairly confuse newer players. if they aren't to know who is a threat, then they should not be presented with a functionality that pretends to tell them who is a threat. that's just ui lying, and its sort has been one of the major barriers to entry to the game.here's an idea: make two default settings:1.) by default, when you haven't performed any actions for 5 minutes, you get flagged afk2.) by default, you cannot see who is afk on the overview.- and the option to change them is buried deep in there somewhere where people won't find it on their own most of the timethis way you have to elect to be given the intel, which acts as a stopgap to prevent confused rookies while disguising itself as one of those brutal facets of eve that gives veteran players an advantage."
1/20/2015,did you just say nerf newbies and buff afk cloakies?
1/20/2015,"i don't feel that a buff to veterans is necessarily a nerf to newbies. this game runs on malcanis' law, why start trying to evade it today? all we need do is lessen the impact for the poor newbs, and give them more time to revel in how powerful they will someday become if they stick with it.but furthermore i don't see how my suggestion is a buff to afk cloakies."
1/20/2015,"there are several common complaints about standings that have been brought to me. one is the slow method of repairing standings from a negative standpoint. this topic was discussed during the summit summit and no resolution came of it yet. the idea is that healing negative standings should become more flexible and more productive. please understand that any time i speak of any type of standings repair it never, ever goes above zero. there are tools in high sec where you can turn in tags for instance for a standings buff but those agents are tucked deep in high sec space where negative standing pilots would have to deal with the faction police while trying to repair them. much of this discussion comes from players who have decided to leave faction warfare and their repair comes at a long series of level one missions. it makes me ask questions. is our current mission system the best? do people have to go through a series of level 1 missions to get to level 2 missions or should it be a choice? if people could grind their standings back with level 4 and 5 agents instead of level one agents would it be a better solution? it is a topic i<U+FFFD>d want to sit back and engage in a broad spectrum of players with. it needs to be more graceful. when players walk away from a game mechanic and give up a chunk of the game they want to play rather than endure it i think it needs to be looked at and a way to make that better found.the other idea is doing more for those with positive standings. there are bonuses but why not more for those who keep them up? more reasons and options to try to maintain high standings for those that do. it is a mechanic that i believe needs to be looked at. it needs to be a bit more clear and the information for gains and losses more obvious to the player."
1/20/2015,"i want to see a fleet mechanic that allows fleet operators to make it public what your intentions are. example: a npsi fleet decides to broadcast open hostility publicly, so that nobody is butthurt when they get shot by a blue cause they can see that the blue is in a npsi fleet.thoughts?"
1/20/2015,"seems to be a faint whiff of drama just waiting to surface.yet to be convinced the npsi community needs a dedicated csm, ganked, spectre fleet, bombers bar all seem to do pretty well and there seems to be no mechanics that impinge them."
1/20/2015,"i have to admit i had no difficulty with the idea of flying npsi with agony unleashed a couple of times. maybe it's because i'm in test, or maybe because my corp is cool like that, but i just didn't fear any repercussions from a mistake on my part. on the contrary, i rather relished the thought of possibly running into a blue or green and having to make a split second decision to assist my fleet or leave them alone. i even spent a fair bit of time running through scenarios in my head and deciding how i would act in each. i was a bit disappointed to not meet any friendlies during the roam-or perhaps i wasn't paying attention and shot somebody blue who is mad and is gonna hunt me down later.these sorts of unknowns add a sense of adventure to eve. i know a lot of people dislike them but i am careful to advocate the ability to see through it because such functions quickly become fleet/alliance doctrine and it destroys that adventure."
1/20/2015,"there are a few things that i would like to see happen with the current fleet mechanics, and the one closest to what you're talking is the ""fleet standings"" concept. the gist of it is simple: members of a fleet inherit standings from fc. your blues are now the fc's blues, your reds are now the fc's red, and people view you in the same way they would view the fc. these standings would preferably only apply for the duration of the fleet, and only if the fc ""enabled"" that option etc etc.whether that is technically possible given the coding for standings and fleet, i don't know."
1/20/2015,"in the same way that there are no mechanics that impinge them (which i would argue is untrue) there are no mechanics that support the playstyle at all. people have simply developed creative ways of using chat channels and mailing lists to organize these thriving communities.alternatively, you could make the same argument against sov warfare. the system is currently functional, wars are being fought, sov is changing hands, the alliance that live is sov space seem to be doing pretty well.... why do they need a csm? why does sov need to be worked on?the csm does more than just fix broken things, they let ccp know how and what they need to do to make the game better.... and there are a lot of different things that could be done to make the channel based communities better."
1/20/2015,"i like this man because he is intelligent and well-spoken, and whether or not i support his specific ideas i feel he has a good head on his shoulders.though i kind of like the ideas, too.+1, i may vote for you."

1/20/2015,"as a csm candidate, i want to focus on three vital areas of eve<U+FFFD>s short and long-term development. they are initiatives that have already proven their value to the community, which is all the more reason ccp must continue to push and refine these initiatives. modern marketing new(er) player experience building the exploration bridge modern marketingif you<U+FFFD>ve talked to your non-capsuleer gaming friends, you know the public perception of eve online is terrible. <U+FFFD>it<U+FFFD>s too late to bother.<U+FFFD> <U+FFFD>it<U+FFFD>s a spreadsheet simulator.<U+FFFD> <U+FFFD>i don<U+FFFD>t have enough time.<U+FFFD> <U+FFFD>the learning curve is too hard.<U+FFFD> <U+FFFD>everyone is a sociopath.<U+FFFD> tens of thousands of potential customers have been turned off without ever stepping into a pod <U+FFFD> a complete shame.this may sound like a strange focus for a csm candidate, but until the widespread myths about eve are dispelled and ccp takes a more modern approach to their advertising efforts, the company is throwing away millions in lost opportunities.i bring my professional experience in branding, copywriting, and marketing to the table for csm x. i<U+FFFD>ve created successful campaigns for corporations here in the real world, and i know how to get gamers interested in even niche titles like eve. as stated earlier, i<U+FFFD>ve already referred thousands of players to the game, but i<U+FFFD>ve also been heavily involved in promotion for other titles via my youtube channel and at top tier tactics, my previous gaming strategy website. i<U+FFFD>ve also branded and built my own corporation<U+FFFD>s website to wonderful results.currently, i see a great number of opportunities for improving eve<U+FFFD>s reach to the gaming public, including but not limited to:<U+FFFD> strategic content arrangements with gaming press across multiple regions<U+FFFD> internally produced or community outsourced tutorials and introductions<U+FFFD> expanded efforts to promote external media creation from within the community<U+FFFD> video content partnerships with popular influencer channels<U+FFFD> ppc/sem advertising campaigns to convert prospects at all levels of interest<U+FFFD> a refined acquisition funnel with more thoughtfully constructed and tested landing pagesnew(er) player experienceof course, you can lead a horse to water, but you can<U+FFFD>t make it press f1. we can get millions of people to try eve, but the reality is that eve<U+FFFD>s new player experience sucks. if i remember correctly, newbie retention rates have been estimated near 10%. that number is abysmal, but imagine the difference in player population if it could be bumped even 5%. eve would be infused with new pilots, cashflow, and content at unprecedented rates.so what<U+FFFD>s to blame for the state of player retention? most obviously the tutorial, while much better than it was in the past, is convoluted. there are almost no explanations for basic game concepts, such as the different types of navigation, the relationship between ships, pods, and your avatar, etc. simple stuff like purchasing items and fitting your ship are basically a mystery.think about how many elements in the game are downright invisible to new players. if nobody outright told you, you<U+FFFD>d have no clue that you could learn a skill to overheat your modules. you<U+FFFD>d have no clue how to overheat your modules. you wouldn<U+FFFD>t know what heat damage was, or that you could repair it. even if you bought nanite paste, you still wouldn<U+FFFD>t know how to actually apply it to your ship!new players need direction to avoid the feeling that <U+FFFD>there is nothing to do.<U+FFFD> we as experienced players know this is a na<U+FFFD>ve assumption, but someone whose trial is about to expire can<U+FFFD>t be asked to just believe the game gets interesting. they have to be shown the possibilities and offered reasonable advice on how they can do it.<U+FFFD> increased emphasis on finding and joining player corporations<U+FFFD> in-game tools, data, or records to help evaluate a corp<U+FFFD>s activities and trustworthiness<U+FFFD> additional career agents or career paths (pi, incursions, fw, etc.)<U+FFFD> a more refined <U+FFFD>masteries<U+FFFD> system with more obvious career-based guidance<U+FFFD> basic, intermediate, and advanced navigation training<U+FFFD> explain d-scan and the goddamn camera controls to people(continued in next post)"
1/20/2015,"building the exploration bridgewhen i look back at my eve career thus far (however short it is compared to those of most players), i see how wonderfully far the career path of exploration has taken me. starting with a pitiful imicus probing deep into nullsec, i learned brutal lessons in navigation, intelligence gathering, wormhole mapping, combat scanning, and interpersonal diplomacy. before you know it, i was capable not only of funding my misadventures, but also hunting the competitors who once threatened my existence.in the past few years, we<U+FFFD>ve seen ccp promote exploration more and more heavily. they<U+FFFD>ve promoted special explorer dlc packs for steam to encourage newbies to scan the stars. they built sisters of eve ships well-suited to handle all types of deep-space content. they<U+FFFD>ve created new locations in the form of shattered wormhole systems, and launched difficult sleeper caches to test the wits of adventurers.we are now at a point where the bridge is almost complete <U+FFFD> the bridge that can carry enterprising newbies from know-nothings to seasoned pilots unafraid to engage anything and anyone in all security sectors of space. if ccp can successfully leverage its massive population of explorers, there will be few limits to the amount and types of content they can create.<U+FFFD> expand hacking to pvp roles, including hacking warp bubbles and abandoned pos sticks<U+FFFD> meaningfully differentiate hacking and archeology, or combine them and be done with it<U+FFFD> continue to expand upon wormhole space with even greater rewards for daytrippers<U+FFFD> fix problems and reinstate a meaningful risk/reward balance for ess and siphon units <U+FFFD> expand on exploration mining to give miners higher risk/higher reward options<U+FFFD> revamp the beta map to provide meaningful information while traversing w-spacei understand not everyone will be interested in exploration, and that's okay. because more exploration means that no matter where you live or what you do in eve, the content will eventually come to you. and by giving explorers more meaningful ways to interact with other players (either via direct combat or by fiddling with their property), we can increase dynamism and ultimately have more interesting stories to tell."

1/20/2015,"a few questions for you.do you feel that the recent changes to recon ships have put them in a better place and do you think that those changes have improved fw plexing or did they hurt it?do you think there should be some kind of range mechanic that doesn't allow ships to use boosters within a certain range of gates, stations or poss? what is your favorite thing about fw and what type of things does fw offer that other parts of the game doesn't?yesterday's weirdness is tomorrow's reason why. hunter s. thompson"
1/20/2015,"another question, why would it be sensible for any tlf fw pilots to vote for an amarr candidate instead of one of the fw neutral low sec candidates?"
1/20/2015,it's happening!
1/20/2015,"best of luck, davo. fully support newbros getting involved with all areas of new eden.screw your courage to the sticking place."
1/20/2015,"well, since this question is going to come up eventually: are you an official hero candidate?"
1/20/2015,"that will be determined later. regardless of whether or not i become an official hero candidate, i plan to campaign my guts out.also, i recently received a pm i would like to answer publically:i don't think my perspective is that different. the largest spike of new players joining eve occured after the battle of b-r5rb, a pvp event between nullsec coalitions. i personally joined eve for pvp and sov fights, and i assume a lot of other new players joined for similar reasons. however, i suspect a lot of new players think nullsec is endgame content they need to grind through hisec and lowsec to compete in, hence why they stay in hisec. my difference in perspective is from jumping straight into the deep end.however, personal opinion is one thing (and can be rather misleading), so i decided to dig deeper: are new players staying in hisec because they enjoy it? googling for information on ""new player motivations eve"" led to this mittani article on a ccp presentation about the new player experience at fanfest, which subsequently led to this joystiq article on the same presentation, as well as a youtube video of it. judging by ccp's statistics of 90% of new players either quitting or doing solo/mission play instead of engaging with the larger player base, i'd guess most new players stay in hisec out of perceived necessity rather than choice.that's an issue to me. if i had stayed in hisec instead of trying my hand at nullsec, odds are i would have quit playing months ago. how can we get them to test out other waters outside of hisec?my solution? emphasize wormholes. wormholes provide an easy way to dip your toes into losec, nullsec, and w-space without going too far from home or moving all your stuff, but they currently aren't even referenced in the tutorials, therefore most newbros are unaware of how to use them (or think they're more dangerous than they actually are). point newbros towards the wormholes, tell them of the lucrative opportunites that await on the other side, and watch as they expand their horizons."
1/20/2015,"dave isn't the most experienced csm candidate ever. but he's a hell of a good writer, and can explain exactly what he (and other newbies) find confusing or barriers to becoming more involved in the game. ccp can use hearing directly from new players on the csm, and i can't think of someone better than dave to represent new players firsthand."
1/20/2015,
1/21/2015,"is this for real? i've done black ops before. generally it is a pile of guys sharing pics off the internet while 2 or 3 scouts scour the landscape as far as they can while still being in jump range. 90% of 'targets' are bots that autolog the second a non-friendly pops into local. the only way i could ever see jump fatigue really set in during this is if you were too lazy to jump the amazing 4 or 5 jumps via stargate and instead really really wanted to sit and do nothing for an extra ... what ... 5 minutes?black ops can get you into a system past the usual +1 or +2 scouts. it isn't, and never was, a viable solution to covering the galaxy.fatigue is good for the game. the only change i'd make would be giving caps a decent jump range again. dreads always sucked because they couldn't go as far as a carrier. now everything sucks like a dread. using the jump drive should actually be worthwhile and get you more than 3-6 standard jumps. it should also be able to span some of those little gaps between some of the outlying regions usually served by a single choke point."

1/21/2015,"keeping in mind that overall i am very happy with the new model: it can at times be a bit more chaotic and stressful. when you go from teams while having a say in what they worked on the final decision came from somewhere else, to teams being responsible for that it adds to the stress. i know i for one am still getting used to it."
1/21/2015,can we have some more details on this? two-factor authentication was hinted at years ago at fanfest (i forget which year exactly) when ccp distributed dongles.mdd
1/21/2015,"absolutely fantastic work on getting these minutes out so quickly! i look forward to reading the rest as you release them. i am super excited that ccp wants to remove attributes. this is really something that has been a very long time coming. i really hope that this becomes a priority because the sooner this happens the better for everyone.i also hope that you remove learning implants from eve as they are a disincentive to pvp. if a 15 mil isk clone was enough of a disincentive to pvp that ccp removed clone grades then a 40 mil isk pod (two +4 implants) is an even bigger one.i know that people often bring up the idea of a learning booster, as an alternative to learning implants, that only lasts for a few days and won't die if you get podded. the issue with this is nearly everyone will use it. in all likelihood most groups will take to giving them out to their pilots for free. brave would give them out because their atron pilots will get into cruisers faster and the cfc/n3/russians will give them out to help their pilots transition from doctrine to doctrine quicker, or get better at flying their current doctrine. it is a classic example of ""if everyone is super than no one is."" so skip the learning booster entirely. also, those groups that can't afford the advantage of giving everyone free or subsidized learning boosters will fall even further behind these groups and find themselves having a hard time competing with them. that just leaves nullsec and such even more stagnant. all around it is an interesting idea that ultimately would be worse for eve.so please just skip any form of learning booster/implant and give everyone the same flat sp/hour. it will be the best decision for eve."
1/21/2015,"you guys, wow! that is an impressive feat getting this info out to the community so quickly. great job! having been in the ""write and edit csm minutes"" hot seat, i can really appreciate the work that went into this. how fast does ccp logibro type? :pquick skim has me interested, looking forward to a more thorough read."
1/21/2015,"oh wow. that would be nifty. that is great news.i would like to add a couple thoughts on day 1regarding burnout and disinterest, i think skill level v prerequisites should be reconsidered. broadly speaking, one of the results would be obtaining a minimum-skilled ship sooner, while still having the deep range of ""everything level v."" when a ship like the golem is within arm's reach, it promotes trial upgrades with a closer carrot, without shortening the training period of maximum specialization. the current convention of ""specialization"" need to be sacrificed. things like a minimum-skilled golem (not including guns) being 90 days away, come on, no trial player is motivated by that. it's not even that great after satisfying the minimum skills to sit in it.""making eve look cool while the player is afk."" other games have a healthy pulse when it comes to art. the utility of this art is maintaining the game's presence while the player is not actively playing. the social media support is great (the share image button--my pick would be imgur). however, you could still release more art. even if it's just wip scraps, and screenshots of incomplete models and art, any types of art blogs or image dumps (with a ccp dev name attached to it) would be awesome. it's self-referential as a game and possibly immersion-breaking, but i think it's appropriate for spreading awareness while afk. it also indicates more life on the dev side of things.true, there is eve now (the site), but its presentation is more polished and professional, and slightly corporate. as a born texan, i am deeply moved by steve ronuken's chili recipe."

1/21/2015,"for sort of a middle-ground idea, jump freighters only require freighter iv instead of freighter v. requiring that would mean that at least some level of specialization was required per faction (as is the stated theme of t2) without the enormously demanding month-or-so train of getting a cruiser, for example, to v. it would, for better or worse, mean that you would have to be careful about what bonuses went on the base-hull skill as opposed to the t2 skill, of course."
1/21/2015,i must say i like the turnaround time on these.
1/21/2015,"i think you would be amazed at how much of a difference it would make if you could do something as simple as customize the skin of your ship directly (especially for new players or bored bitter vets).if anybody ever played city of heroes, that would be a good analogy of what i am talking about. all the archetypes had the same power sets and nothing you did in character customization made any difference in the actual play, but it made all the difference in your investment in the toon, and made character generation a blast.in eve, the ships are the toons in my analogy, and if those could be customized using an in-game interface similar to the ui, but specifically for the ship, people would want to get in different ships just because they look cool. this is anti-utilitarian, and seemingly stupid, but it's the little thing that make a game fun and worth it. it also drives goals and motivation for new players.i have played this game on and off since '03, and surprisingly enough, the one thing i don't really feel like i am ever really doing is making stuff mine, it is just stuff i happen to hold. there is nothing special about any of my beloved ships. no battle scars, no tweaked out appearance, my thorax is just a thorax like all others.half the game is also shopping (my wife loves shopping and yet still hates eve), i guarantee if she could shop for a thorax that was custom skinned and on market as a ""customized"" model (simply a different player designed skin) she would be at it for hours, or designing and selling her own, hell, she might even go into production, and mine and do all the other manufacturing crap, just to have her own line of designer thoraxes. it's the seemingly stupid trivial things, that make bigger mechanics work. i have manufactures all kinds of stuff in eve, and it is just variations on a bland theme to play the .01 isk game etc, it's not like me making it felt like i made it, but rather jumped through the right hoops....might as well shoot the red crosses. in other words, even though i made it, there was nothing special about it whatsoever, might as well makes drops in the ocean...if that makes sense.the current skinning is a peta, and the licensing and aura driven funky model now where they are yet still made on your behalf is likely in the wrong direction (i am probably describing it wrong because the mechanic should be right there in the fitting window, or a fitting type window instead of some external store that i have to do things and stuff to get it, which i will likely never bother to learn or care about). i love eve, and have played it forever, this is by no means the one thing missing, but having tried to recruit all kinds of people for years, mostly unsuccessfully (and more importantly seeing what they do end up playing) i think a simple thing like this would go along way to drive new subscriptions and give people reasons to try all aspects of the game.minecraft is insanely popular because building stuff is fun, especially stuff that is unique to you, even though it functions the same or similar to all other similar things."

1/21/2015,"not only is ""isk faucet"" poorly defined in your question, but you're also working on the assumption that wormholes shouldn't be isk faucets. why shouldn't they pay out more than other areas of space? with more risk comes more reward.a better question would be: corbexx, do you feel that isk generating activities in wormholes are too lucrative?.... which is a question for may as well answer, corbexx."
1/21/2015,"jenshae is actually working on the assumption that they are currently not isk faucets, regardless of whether or not they should be. i would counter that they are isk faucets as is easily demonstrated by the loot they provide which is turned in directly to npc agencies in known space in unlimited quantities for a flat rate isk value. as to their significance in comparison to other isk faucets, there are charts for that. unfortunately i cannot find one at the moment. but ask ccp and they can tell you exactly how much isk comes from wormhole space relative to other sources. they track this info."
1/21/2015,"apologises for late reply.in regards to should wormholes be made easier if t3's do get nerfed i don't think its needed all the sites can be done in ships other than t3, caps and rapiers easily do c5 and c6 cap escalations marauders can handle c5 and down, a couple guards and hacs will also easily do most stuff. i dont think a new ship class would be needed at all to do sleeper sites.i think its fine for a group of 1 month old newbros to survive and thrive in a c1 ( i moved in to a c3 1 week old with some mates). it might not be the easiest thing, fair play if they can grow and move up to higher class wormholes should they wish.i dont think surviving in w space should need 6 months experience in k space. what i will say is while i do like new people in w space i'm not to keen on trying to force 1 day old new people in, more for the fact that w space isnt the safest or easiest place to survive in, without a decent group to help support these players.my alt is actually in the brave wormhole newbro corp catastrophic overview failure, and they got a couple of really new players (2 or 3 day old) and brought them in to the wormhole, and i've been chatting to them about how they are finding it. without the corp helping they'd really struggle."
1/21/2015,"i would love to see (1) but as malc says, there would have to be an entire structure of an enforcement arm (financial concord) or there would be no accountability. without accountability a stock market is waaaaay too hazardous for all but the most wildcat investors. as for antipiracy are you talking about taking/making concord contracts? maybe a mission hub that notices the bad standing folks in the region and offers you a chance to hunt and shoot first without concord slapping your hand or even higher level ones that send you into low to hunt them down on their own turf? and what do you mean, core game?comics have a phrase.

1/21/2015,"some comments for you and whether you would support something like this.1) the new player experience needs to be tweaked, and it can be by just doing a few things. could you bring up to ccp to map wasd to directional as default for every new eve installation. it's silly to make people map out those keys just to figure out movement (it's being hidden from them requiring them to hit escape and map). 2) the default ccp overview is crap. while we can now transfer overviews, the default needs a total remake. basically have ccp come out with a viable default for every new game installation. pick the best, and that becomes the new default for players, until they make their own. there's no need to handcuff a new player and to tell them, get a ui from someone else who you can't trust.3) a test should be run regarding voting for csm, so can an incentive be given to the player to get them to vote. something like (you vote and receive 5 geico's, or a gnosis, or a free ingame frigate skin, exclusive to that vote year. it would kick the whole ""it's worthless to vote for csm"" if the players receive something to vote. i wouldn't do skill points, but something like a ship or a skin or some geico's might work. it should be tried this year, and if it doesn't work, no need to do it, if it does though.. just some thoughts."

1/21/2015,i agree with your quote with only very minor reservations (mainly that i see a purpose for rookie systems remaining basically free of conflict but also free of valuable resources).
1/21/2015,"i personally like to ask in fleet ""x up if you are afk."" then when no one x's up those few who are there undock and die. hasn't failed yet.other games do have a pop up ready check that group leaders (in eve's case fc's) can run and it tells them how many said ready, how may said not ready, and how many didn't respond. something similar should be fairly easily implemented and could be useful in fleets. it wouldn't affect local obviously, but it could be useful in corp chat."
1/21/2015,"that's an incredibly simple view to take on complex issues. ideas should be looked at for their individual positives and negatives, even if it reduces conflict. following your idea, some pretty important changes would not have been made, not least of which the recent jump changes which most certainly reduced conflict. sorry, but views like that are as likely to spell the end of eve as the completely opposite view where any change that increases conflict should be rejected."
1/21/2015,i forgot about the wow raid ready checks. that would be obscenely useful for standing fleets.
1/21/2015,"correction, overall the jump changes will over time contribute to increased conflict, not reduced. the reduction in the ability to escalate a conflict means more fights will be committed to instead of standing down out of fear of a counter drop. the conflicts will be smaller in scale naturally, but there should be more of them."
1/21/2015,"have i mentioned that this idiot is the day to day leadership of my corp? :)as someone that briefly played wow, i can confirm that this feature is useful in groups that are both voluntary to join and expected to remain consistently active (so useful for fleets, but not corp/alliance wide, as corps/alliances often have people who are online, docked/possed and afk).the wow feature in question is very obtrusive (it takes your client's focus and must be clicked through to move on). it would need to be unobtrusive in eve, otherwise spies in blob fights will spam it at bad times, such as 0.25-2 seconds after someone broadcasts for reps and screams in voice ""break break, my nyx is at 15% structure"". i'm for spies having disruptive tools to use in fights, but they should not be based upon restricting the abilities of other players to communicate with their game client."
1/21/2015,"i agree with tengu here, removing the spectre of massive counterdrops makes fielding capital fleets in combat more viable in the game. the game was on a trajectory toward total stagnation prior to phoebe that might have seen one or two more very large set piece battles like br-5 but wouldn't have seen the loss of ten carriers here, six dreads there, one supercapital here, etc. in terms of driving conflict, however, the most successful change in nullsec in recent years was the moongoo reshuffle, which led to a nasty breakup between goons and test and content that even spread into highsec."
1/21/2015,"confirming.i agree that if anyone can start it, it would need to be unobtrusive. however i was thinking, and forgot to mention, that really the fc is the only person who needs to be able to do this. well, fc or fleet boss in the event they are not the same person."
1/21/2015,"true, and if your fc's a spy, you have bigger problems than spammed checks."

1/21/2015,"as someone said in another campaign thread, it's not that simple. i've murdered people in an instalocking hic in low sec gate camps and in that sense i was driving conflict. i also got killed doing that when the bigger fish arrived, so still driving conflict. if i was able to do that with impunity on the jita 4-4 undock it would drive conflict but not necessarily be good for the game."
1/21/2015,i cannot answer yes or no and you do not want any other words about it.
1/21/2015,"that reminds me of an experience i had in a small scifi pvp mud years ago.new players started on earth. in order to do anything, you had to launch off earth and travel to other planets. however, the moment you reached earth orbit a camping battleship immediately blew up your ship. i tried several times over the next few days to leave, including pooling my money with other players to buy a better ship, and got blown up every time. checking the game's forums, i wasn't the only one with this problem; apparently the player(s) spent 10+ hours every day just camping earth orbit and blowing up new players trying to leave just for the lulz. the game's developers said the game was working-as-intended and that they wouldn't act against the camper. the popular theory among the forum populace was the camper was close friends with the developers. i quit a few days later and moved on to greener pastures.there was plenty of conflict there; it was just horrendously one-sided and caught new players in a catch-22 loop of needing a more expensive ship to leave earth, but being unable to make money without leaving earth.not all conflict is the same. there are certain types of conflict we want to encourage, and other types of conflict we want to avoid like the plague. in addition, there needs to be downtimes between conflict, an ebb and flow between conflict and peace, etc. if, for example, all of nullsec was locked into sov war and fighting over timers every day, there would be obscene burnout amongst the nullsec coalitions."
1/21/2015,apologies: i have been sick as a dog and really got behind on my posting. i'll pm you to find out what dates suit you.
1/21/2015,"apologies for the delay responding to you. i blame h3n2 variant flu.first, i should say that i am part of the supercapital problem. i have a titan and a supercarrier of my own, and have encouraged people in my corporation to get into supercaps to the extent that bat country (a small corp at the best of times) have the fifth or sixth most supers in the whole cfc. so i<U+FFFD>m not coming to this from the point of view of a supercap-hating goon with a lingering inferiority complex.ccp had the chance to do something radical about supercaps years ago, but the genie is out of the bottle, now. i have heard figures mentioned that suggest that there is now a substantial, five-figure total of supercapitals in the game. even assuming that only six or seven thousand of those are subscribed, ccp do not strike me as being in the sort of position where they can afford to have those accounts unsub, let alone the associated subcap accounts.but i feel that they have to do something. groups like brave newbies have amazed me with how far they have come in the past year, but the fact is that they cannot hope to compete with older groups like ncdot, pl or us in a serious sov war without essentially standing behind the shield of one of those groups. i am sure that i am far from alone in having newer players despondently mention that they feel it is impossible ever to catch up.i don<U+FFFD>t have a simple solution because i believe there is no longer a simple solution. perhaps a specialised role can be found within the new sov revamp? perhaps the long-suggested solution of <U+FFFD>choose a station: ok here are the relevant number of capital components<U+FFFD> is not yet impossible. but i don<U+FFFD>t want to play a game where serious warfare is predicated upon only one class of ships, even if we have the most of those ships."
1/21/2015,"re your second question: as it was, we were stood on and shoved-around by the major powers in 2006, and the disparity we faced back then was only one of being in cruisers while facing hacs and battleships. we didn<U+FFFD>t succeed because of ability or ships: i suspect that the leadership and the resilient culture that saw us through would probably have had a chance today, too. but it would have been desperately hard, and we would have been faced with paying rent* or protection money to one of the hegemons. not a glorious story.i think that adding more, conventional k-space systems would be inviting more renting by the same dominant blocs who would snap it up in a matter of days. i suggested on my blog that the solution was to make groups require less space: to allow for more dense occupation of space and to make it far harder to hold large tracts of space. i think that the phoebe changes, although a trifle cart-before-horse in implementing the power projection changes before the profitable-nullsec changes, were at least a step in that direction.*technically we rented some belts in a system in syndicate as it was!"
1/21/2015,"a more balkanised eve absolutely implies an eve in which the cfc and n3 cease to exist in their current, vast, unwieldy forms. frankly i would like to see an eve in which even an alliance the size of goonswarm is seen as unnecessary. this should be done, as i suggested in my blog, not with the stick but with the carrot. once people no longer feel the need to huddle up into megacoalitions then those vast blocs will drift (or fly!) apart, as the centripetal forces of fear that hold them together no longer counterbalances the centrifugal forces of drama and independent-minded leaders.as to how this is achieved, i will spare people the need to read the vast tracts i wrote on the subject at endie.net in the summer of last year, but it is all there!"
1/21/2015,i wish that i had put it this concisely!
1/21/2015,"is it easy to take sov though? i have taken part in sov-war (small scale) and it didn't seem easy what with the endless timers. i guess it's easy to take sov with lots of supers. with subcaps, not so much.i'll read your articles on sov and nullsec."
1/21/2015,"it is easy for the established powers to take sov from younger powers. the most recent example i can cite is the recent pl vs hero war, in which pl managed to take a half-dozen systems from us, threatened an important gateway system, and nearly aborted one of our supers. now note that all that was them playing with us; if they really wanted to, they would've held a half-week bashathon and conquered all of catch, driving out the several thousand active brave players. once they did, they could essentially control catch without actually living there. they could just fall back to npc nullsec and just show up for timers to dissuade us from recapturing catch and essentially turn it into a ghost region.thought experiment: if pl, cfc, or nc. wanted to, they could form a marauding band of supers, smash into every younger nullsec coalition that couldn't fight back, drive them from sov they had occupied for several months, and immediately move on, leaving desolated nullsec in their wake. it is feasible the supergroups could depopulate vast swaths of nullsec (albeit not practical, because they could make more isk from renting it out) without putting a dent in their own resources.the chances of them falling into a vietnam war-like situation, where a superior force takes expensive losses trying to conquer territory from inferior-but-persistent defenders, is very slim. it is far more likely the defenders in this situation take crippling isk losses while a more-expensive attacking force takes almost none because the defenders can't break through their reps.here i will reference the december 5th battle for hed-gp, which in my opinion should be mandatory study for anyone interested in supers vs subcaps balance, or the power struggles between older and newer coalitions. there, pl's subcap fleet got wiped out, leaving a few dozen capitals & supers at the mercy of 800 bloodthirsty brave defenders. brave had enough firepower to wipe out the capitals' drones, effectively neutering them. in response, pl's capitals turtled up, repping each other. brave couldn't break through the reps, so what followed was a 2-hour fight to keep pl's supers tackled while we batphoned black legion to bring enough firepower to crack through their reps. in the end, we only managed to kill 1 super before nc warped in its own group of supers to reinforce pl's fleet, once again making them nigh-unbreakable.actually, endie, i would like to hear your thoughts on that battle for hed-gp, since it is (in my opinion) the best example of an all-out supers vs subcaps brawl in the game thus far. in addition, what other fights over the past year do you think should be studied by the csm?"
1/21/2015,this is where i believe eve needs a new class of ship. a subcap designed to kill caps and supercaps.
1/21/2015,"isn't that what battleships are meant to be? well, perhaps could be; i know they've fallen out of favor in the current meta, and it'd be nice to give them a bit more love.but there is still the underlying problem of breaking through capital reps. the biggest issue with supers isn't the dps, it's the reps, because once you reach a critical mass of supers repping each other you can survive forever against most fleets. (players will argue capacitor draining is the solution to that, but since you can install capital-grade remote cap transmitters that is no longer a problem once you reach a critical mass as well.) we'd need to make it so if you field a group of x supers, you could still lose a few to a slightly inferior force, rather than forcing your opponent to bring x+10 supers just to put a dent in your reps, but that would probably require redoing reps entirely.sadly, the only experience i have with capitals is on the frustrating receiving end, so i mainly know them as these nigh-unstoppable juggernauts rather than being familiar with what weaknesses they already have."
1/21/2015,"a dark newbro joke:q: ""what's the best advice you can give to a new eve player?""a: ""start 8 years ago.""but yes, i realize hero started similarly to goonswarm years ago. i've also heard plenty of taunts and insults that we do not belong in nullsec because we're not powerful enough, or that we are only alive because the superpowers view us as pets or entertainment. if either are true, i think their truth would speak more about problems with nullsec currently than a fatal flaw in hero itself, namely that our biggest problem is we didn't ""start 8 years ago""."
1/21/2015,you should have seen some of the things that were said about goonswarm when they were at a similar stage in their evolution.

1/21/2015,"just to make sure i'm reading this correctly, it sounds like you're saying that what hero needs is basically 10 trillion isk to buy a supercapital fleet and pilots for it? (i'm figuring that would buy you 1-200 supercapitals, distributed somehow between titans and supercarriers, and alts to fly them.)i'm not trying to belittle this, i'm just trying to confirm if you're basically saying that asset and skill point disparities are the main things that were highlighted, and that those are pretty fixable."

1/21/2015,"responses as promised now that i'm back on a normal schedule: there are a couple of meta-issues going on here. as someone who blobs rather filthily on a regular basis, the number one thing that enables us to make solo pvpers miserable is the fact that there is an intel inbalance between us and the people that we kill. this is a problem which can somewhat be solved by the players rather than by the developers - in particular,"
1/21/2015,this is an earnest and thoughtful man and the csm would be well served by having him on board. has my top vote.
1/21/2015,"i<U+FFFD>m alyxportur, i live in delve sovereign space, and i fly dps/logistics characters under the kadeshi. i grew up and out of highsec nearly four years ago, and i<U+FFFD>ve been flying pilots in nullsec sov alliances for nearly three years now. i never plan on quitting eve until i either die or iceland gets covered by lava/rising atlantic water.as i promised last year, i will promise again: whether you vote for me or not, if i win, i will still represent all of you as best as i can. we all want to see eve continue to survive as a game we love, but also thrive.since my last campaign, ccp has improved upon two issues: corporate bookmarks and power projection. the corp bookmark limit has increased, but for nullsec groups this is insufficient. without alliance bookmarks, corporations have identical bookmarks to locations like jump bridges. alliances may have been the band aid to early corporations banding together based on standings, but it isn't a temporary fix anymore. alliances continue to need their own bookmarks. upping the maximum size for corporations means that nullsec groups can then increase the number of duplicates, when a single set controlled by the holding corp of an alliance would be far more useful to a member of any alliance, regardless of whether they live in wormholes, nullsec, lowsec, or highsec. (ccp has said in the past they plan on changing corp management as a whole in a ~few years, but perhaps that could be fast-tracked since making the social aspect of eve intuitive, logical and useful encourages more gameplay.) capital power projection has been nerfed both in range and time. it takes more time and more jumps for a capital to go anywhere. without the additional changes to sovereignty mechanics and structures, nullsec since phoebe doesn't seem to have had any increase in sov warfare. it's as stagnant as it was before, if not more so (though congrats to the neutrals who managed to freeport some systems!). in regard to the expected changes, i'm not sure how occupancy-based nullsec does anything but encourage renter alliances protected by the pvp-alliances who control them. sov structure changes may enable more border fighting and changes though, and i look forward to those patch notes. other topics: sentry drone scan resolution nerf to ishtars. cloaks ended up not being changed. cloaky camping seems to be less of a problem than last year, but maybe that<U+FFFD>s just because plex prices are too high to keep a toon camping for weeks at a time. cloaks could still be tweaked, perhaps as part of the ongoing module tiericide so that they provide more and different options of how to fly ships rather than just what you can fly with them. players still deserve killmails for all anchorable units that they kill. the only ones that they don<U+FFFD>t get credit for: mobile warp disruptors. expanding the in-game information on killmails to include useful data such as: damage over time charts, time to kill (e.g. from first pvp timer initiation on killed player up until ship/pod death), adding logistics to killmails, etc. when it comes to logistics being on killmails, if we participate in a fight and gain an aggression timer, why not award us a killmail recognition for the similar hard work that our dps brothers and sisters did? if you cut us, do we not bleed? (as a logi pilot, i<U+FFFD>ll admit i<U+FFFD>m biased on this topic.) the new crest api system shows a lot of promise and sitting in on a third-party developer discussion at eve vegas 2014 made me more excited for the future of it and its usefulness within eve. continuing to release parts of what it can do should encourage a lot of the current and new applications popping up for everyone to use, like seat. while i may have been one of the few players who used the industrial teams, ccp took an interesting step in removing them from the game rather than leaving them for the usage minority. from my nullsec perspective, the bounty and kill right systems could benefit from changes. most players don<U+FFFD>t seem to hunt via either systems, but benefit from the bounty or activate the rights as they stumble upon someone. ccp recently changed the rules for some mobile structures so that players only gained a suspect timer for shooting them. i<U+FFFD>d like to see this extended to more structures. the last change that i can remember to implants was just in how they were obtained (i.e. increasing availability and lowering costs for some, but not all, of the mindlink implants). it would be nice to see more changes that encourage the use of them. pilots may no longer need to worry about losing skills with their pod losses, but implants don<U+FFFD>t drop----and i<U+FFFD>m sure i<U+FFFD>m not the only corpse collector hoping for the day when i can salvage the bodies for random implant drops. encounter surveillance systems (esses) they<U+FFFD>re nice and they provide some interesting content when an enemy interceptor comes into system, but pirate faction ess units would provide more content in both the short- and long-term, as well as break some of the regional holds on faction-specific ships. tl;dr = i want to see boring, stagnant and unused things change without becoming broken or worse than they were. i'm not a conspiracy theorist. i live in nullsec. i like the taste of blueberry donuts."
1/21/2015,"following my interview with cap stable, i thought more on the utility of being able to save and reuse structure layouts for planetary interaction. being able to share these layouts between players would be remarkable, and turn an activity normally left to the individual into one that is a bit more social.a similar mechanism for pos modules would be as useful (and likely used more). poses are designed for their purpose just like ships. saving module positions relative to the tower location and then using the mechanic to place the same number/type of modules on another pos serves a common need.... however the modules should only be placed as 'unanchored', leaving it to the player still to anchor and online the modules individually. i recognize that ccp has existing issues related to the pos code and rewriting it, but perhaps this feature (which i've only spoken to wormhole and nullsec players about so far) could be added to the game without complications from the existing code. also, being able to share these 'pos plans' on a corporate level rather than a personal one would make sense as poses are owned and controlled by corporate roles.my campaign is officially endorsed by eveskunk"
1/21/2015,"where do i vote ? :)i agree that most of these proposed things need improvement.about the capital travel nerf, ccp managed to nerf the massive power projection of swarms of slowcats and mountains of titans and supers, but in the same time also destroyed the ability of small groups to use those said capitals.and ""same jump range"" for all ships is boring and dumb.---eve is and has always about choices. now there's no choice. you jump, you wait. end.well, pretty much like the new interface icons... all gray and boring. for some strange reason ccp is heading toward making everything ""the same"" in all latest patches. game becomes more and more boring ..."
1/21/2015,"as you seem to be running a very nullsec focused campaign, i'm going to ask you the following:if you could only change one thing from each of the other areas of space - lowsec, highsec, and wormhole space - what would you choose to focus on, and why? what part of these areas of space need the most attention from ccp, and help from the csm?"
1/21/2015,"to answer the first question: highsec: kill rights no longer expire. why? does your desire for revenge end after 30 days? no. lowsec: additional lowsec-to-lowsec, direct connection wormholes with much shorter lifetimes why? pvp opportunities between more than just you and your neighbors or random visitors to your constellation (i'd be interested in faction warfare pilots' view on it) wormholes: tutorial mission(s) for new players which shows them how to find wormholes and in brief explains the benefits/hazards. my suggestion would be a frigate-sized, wormhole signature connecting a system a few jumps away with the agent system, and the signature only being scannable/useable by the new player to discourage exploits. a civilian scan probe launcher + civilian scan probes wouldn't take much skill, but could encourage injection of the astrometrics skill book. why? so new players have an in-game tutorial on how to find wormholes and the basics on what they can do.to answer your second question on what needs the most attention from ccp, i'd have to say that i think corp management needs updated the most as it affects everyone regardless of where they live (unless they live in an npc corp). sure ceos and directors work around and with the current system, but it's a mess with odd limitations and vulnerabilities. i learned it through trial and error over my first two years playing.what needs the most help from the csm? everything. if something is an issue for players, it's our job to tell our elected representatives and it's their job to put pressure on ccp to change (and hopefully improve on) the mechanic in question.to give a more regional-based answer, i'd like to see nullsec sov changes finished in a way that discourages stagnation, while still being the fields from which capital and supercapital fleets are grown and then killed (i miss the big battles, and it saddens me to think that they may not happen again.).lowsec is (by virtue of its physical geography) a patchwork of systems spread throughout highsec. i'd like to say it's overlooked as much as wormhole space, but now we have new wormhole space. more space.... but not more players(?) is my assumption.thera may be popular with pilots already familiar with wormholes, but how many characters ever ventured into a wormhole before they were three months old? i've had wormhole friends comment on how dead nullsec is when they roam through it, and they're partly right.with fewer players in the game, that means fewer residents everywhere----including nullsec bittervets unsubbing or just growing up and getting busy with real life. the game needs to be enjoyable for current players but not have such a steep learning curve.thanks for the questions!"
1/21/2015,"i have flown with alyxportur for several years as a member of kadeshi, he is steady and reliable, he always was there to help. i believe he has the time and energy to be an excellent csm."
1/21/2015,"what are your thoughts on account shared supers. should it be allowed, and if a account shared super or titan is lost by the person borrowing it( like say for a drive by doomsday with out a out cyno) should ccp do anything about it, or was it just a risk of account charing and nothing more."
1/21/2015,"hello all!i would like to let everyone know that i will be placing my name in for csm x. this is the first year that i run an alliance as exec but i bring a lot of years in eve to the table. i always tried to listen to the needs and concerns that most players in eve have and i want to be able to make these voices of eve pilots heard.who am i you ask?i'm a veteran with over 10 years of experience in eve, more sov space than any other area. i have lived in every region in the game and have seen and been apart of most coalitions. i understand the needs and wants of most pilots in eve and the changes we all desire to happen in the game.i am the current exec of skeleton crew. alliance and n3 coalition , i got quite accustomed to newer players and see the potential in taking care of and teaching them with respect, without looking down on them.we are at a point in this game where people need to stand up and make sure that the new incoming players are more taken care of as well as making sure veterans are not forgotten. they are the players who can keep this game playing on and we need to start looking at them more than we have been. i tried to help players for years in eve with my own isk and assets to make sure that everyone i talk to isn't in need of anything.i want to be a csm who:- is known for helping the players in the game as much as possible.- cares about the needs and concerns of each pilot- carries the torch of all players' choices and ideas- talks to everyday players in eve and not forget who they are (like most ex csms have done in the past after election).- bring more and fair content to the game if possible. (fair content is where there are not 1000 vs 1000 every time and the tidi becomes so bad that you can't even enjoy the large scale fights.)i am not here because i think i am better than anyone but because i want to be everyone's voice, from brand new players to 12 year veterans.so please, when time comes, elect me to be your voice as csm x member.thank you!only endorsements not negative feed back pleasepantsufan army exec"

1/21/2015,thank you so much dragonpantsufan army exec
1/21/2015,"i have only known pants for a short time, he does care for all pilots around him, and on a few discussions has the intuitiveness to recognize problems from a different viewpoint, and bring them to light."
1/21/2015,ive been flying with pants for about 8 years and there hasn't been a time where he will wont go out of his way to help a fellow member. i endorse
1/21/2015,known pants for a long time and i strongly endorse his ass to be csm
1/21/2015,"i've been playing with pantsufan only for a month now, and i have never met someone who is as passionate about eve online, its gameplay and mechanics.he has helped me and my corp adapt to null sec large scale pvp and has been very understanding when me or my corp mates have made a mistake or two nd took the time to explain why what we did was wrong and how we can improve our game.i will endorse him and i look forward to flying with him for the future too"
1/21/2015,"on one hand, great, a vet who has alot of experience.one the other, if we really elect somebody called pantsu-fan, can we really claim to be a ""mature gaming community"" anymore?"
1/21/2015,i endorse because he paid me to do so.
1/21/2015,pantsufan is a player with passion and loves green killboards.
1/21/2015,"how many endorsements from your line members did you demand before they can rat with out a fc? also serious question, how do you feel about the null sec meta with huge amounts of space being rented out to alliances that don't want to do anything other rat mine build supers and claim to be part of major coalitions? is that what you want null to be? also if ccp wanted to add a new tutorial and asked the csm for suggestion what would you say the tutorial should cover."
1/21/2015,"given your history of flying off the handle at your own members when they behave in ways that you disapprove of, see eveskunk, how do you intend to be a productive member of a group of players from diverse backgrounds that will likely have very different opinions on what eve's key objectives for the coming year are?"
1/21/2015,"i have been flying with pantsufan since around november of 2014 and over all he is a good guy. he values his player base and our opinions unlike some of the other people i have flown with in the past. is he perfect you might ask and the answer is no. there isn't one of us that is, in my honest opinion. does he learn from mistakes made and continue to get support from his player base ? yes he very much does and his passion for keeping eve alive keeps me logging in day after to reach out to new bro's to teach. this is what makes him different at least in my eyes from the majority of eve players.pants like myself is a firm believer in building relationships with those pilots he flies with inside and outside of eve. this is what keeps me and mine around this alliance. pants you have my endorsement and any way i can help you to achieve this goal of csm i will do my best to be there helping.sincerely,dgsix kado"
1/21/2015,"what will you do on the csm that means you can represent null sec blocks better than manny, sion, or hell god forbid even sort dragon? also, since i am quite familiar with the way you manage your alliance (thanks eveskunk), how would you defend against the accusation that you are in fact, completely incompetent?"
1/21/2015,cut ratting privileges until enough people pile in to defend him for these accusations while never acknowledging them himself. also remember that he doesn't want any negative feedback.
1/21/2015,"historical context for my question: your previous alliance, also called skeleton crew (ref:"
1/21/2015,hello as a former member of skeleton crew i will say that pants has done rather well to get where he is. but behind all the fun and games you see above (using currrent members to endorse him) its rather different. i was on the leadership in skelly and its no fun place. evey little structure and when you try and bring up some issues pants will just sweep it under the carpet. also new members that would join the alliance with out any checks would instantly be put in leadership positions with out meetings with current leadership about them. sadly i would not want him on the csm because his tendancy to fly off the handle and not listen to people and a key role of a csm member is to be able to listen.
1/21/2015,"as far as the accusations that i am an incompetent leader are untrue and i know i do things differently than most exec's. i have done somethings wrong (ratting stuff :/) and other silly mistakes everyone makes. but i have learned from those experiences and grown more into the leader that i should've started out to be. i know that manny, sion and sort are great guys in this, well respected and i have much respect for them as well. sort has taught me a lot of things about how to run a successful alliance and become a better leader. i am glad that i have learned so much from him. this campaign is for something that i feel i can bring diversely to the table and be more bias than most people can be. i am not running a large alliance or coalition so i see what the basic players are wanting and i want to be a voice for them.as for jaakjaak's statement i will only offer factual information about how your corporation only wanted to harm allies in our current coalition. every person has a path they choose in the game. you and your guys choose a path that wasn't about the growth within our current coalition. so yes i made a change to the leadership structure after listening to your version of plans based off of you and your corporations statements about our coalition mates. i picked someone who had a cool head, has built successful relationships in his past and is a well respected member among his fellow alliance mates.last i have never offered or paid anyone in my alliance or any associates of mine to post on here as each of them support this decision to become a voice for the new players in eve online.thanks,pantsufan<U+200F>pantsufan army exec"
1/21/2015,from my experience a new tutorial explaining how to correctly use the fleet tool would be most useful. most new players do not even know what it is or why they should use it. combat is not covered and can empower the new players to achieve more things in this game. it would also be nice to see a tutorial explaining how to correctly setup and utilize the overview.pantsufan army exec
1/21/2015,"im happy for pant's focus on basic players and if he wishes to become a csm member. that being said i am here to provide factual information regarding his willingness to listen to his leadership, i am a retired admiral of skeleton crew(i resigned myself i was not removed) to commit to piracy because of situations inside skeletoncrew, but to the point he is unwilling to listen to his own alliance over his affiliation with n3, his current endorsements come from his own newly appointed leadership, asfar as accusing the corporation he mentioned earlier when they resigned from his alliance they walked away and let them be, that being said they are pirates now. if this csm candidate is willing to learn from his mistakes and listen to the people he claims to represent perhaps he might get elected in the next csm but as for now i as an eve player have stated my peace and why i believe you should think before voting for pantsufan this csm election.my apologizes negative but clean"
1/21/2015,i have been in a leadership command for almost all of the alliances and coalitions pantsufan has been the leader of and ive been flying with him for over 6 years! with that being said he does listen to leadership and always takes our views into account however he is the exec of the alliance therefore the decision will ultimately rest on his shoulders. furthermore he has always kept the players in the alliance as top priority in regards to keeping everyone happy.

1/22/2015,"to fill in a little detail, it's not really evelopedia as a whole. it's things like the item database that's embedded in it. for things like the chronicles, it serves a very good purpose."
1/22/2015,"often the community reads the minutes from these summits quiet sometime after the event, so thanks for the speed in getting these minutes out.but what i'd like to know, is this;obviously there is some sort of an agenda prepared by ccp in advance of the summit taking place. for example day 1agenda<U+F0B7> roadmap & release cadence<U+F0B7> new player experience<U+F0B7> web team<U+F0B7> team size matters<U+F0B7> corporations & alliances<U+F0B7> team homegrown<U+F0B7> team securityi know items on it could change as need be & yes somethings may well be under nda, but would it be possible; for the proposed agenda/outline for these summits be released to the community ( say a week) in advance of the summit's taking place? this would allow the community time to contact our csm representitives in advance of these meetings, to raise with them, any specific issues / points of concern or interest's, that we may want the csm to constructively & directly raise with ccp at the upcoming summit.."
1/22/2015,"""the csm then proposed adding hats to the game"" - seriously?more seriously, i really hope we are going to see some action on the impersonation clause in the next 3 days. it's still hanging about the eula like a dead woodchuck under the porch. the last time i can find it mentioned in the minutes, it seemed the then csm rightly said it should go, but nothing has changed."
1/22/2015,"hats make me happy. i don't want them personally, but it's clothing and csm support of clothing is excellent, imo."
1/22/2015,audio recordings of the summit are also being created if long form minutes are needed for a session that creates controversy. right?
1/22/2015,twitch?
1/22/2015,"so nothing constructive to add at the moment, but i am cuirous about the last bit of the report:""instead of detailed minutes for this session, please find below a recepie for slow cookedchilli, provided by our resident cooking instructor, steve ronuken:(texans, please avert your eyes and do not read further)""i'm from louisiana myself and have lived in texas for the better part of a decade. i'm curious why texans would want to avert their eyes from the recipe as besides the amount of beans used, looks pretty darn good. though admittedly that might be my cajun flare speaking a bit due to the amount of seasoning used..."
1/22/2015,"it could be a mystery. maybe the recipe is opsec for some chili artists ""in the know,"" or...ok as a texan it is actually immediately obvious to me, but i would be betraying the republic by telling you."
1/22/2015,"remove attributes / make them flat : yes !remove learning implants : no !1. this would make pod death worthless. 2. reduced value of higsec/ fw lp stores - those implants provide basic income for many players3. removed player interaction : - people need to haul them around. - some hunt for people hauling them - people trade them. 4. remove of very important isk sink. can someone from ccp tell us how much isk they remove from game each month ?you need to pay isk to get them from lp store. is this blocking pvp?yes , but removing cost of clone upgrade already solved many issues for old players. implants should be additionally enhanced to help new players, while at the same time not providing any significant boost to older players. lets just assume that they provide additional skill hardwiring:for example :a.limited memory ... boosts:- caldari frigate to level 4- light missiles to level 4b. full limited set provides - additional boost to engineering if someone already have those skills he get nothing, but if new player install those it will get big bonus for the first weeks. this bonus is of course not permanent , and you need to train those skills up even when you have those implants."
1/22/2015,we had to wait far too long! can't you just stream the summit with a minute delay to censor any nipple slips or vulgarities?even the minutes switched to a new release cycle giving us small updates instead of one big pile of text. :)
1/22/2015,very dissapointed in the section describing alliance logos.
1/22/2015,"there was a features and ideas thread about learning implants. the short version of my conclusion after chewing on that thread was make jump cloning within the same station zero-cooldown. that way you can maintain a learning clone and a pvp clone. implants should not be removed, for the reason of gameplay for people who collect them."
1/22/2015,"i also suggested this some time ago. this solves more than issue we are currently facing. give players ability to have 20 or more clones, but they can be stored only in 2 locations. to jump between them you need to use your jump timer , but when you want to exchange clones on station you are docked instead of this you can pay 5 or 10 mil just for instant clone changing. 2 stations, tons of clones in there but jumping clone from 3rd location destroys this clone."
1/22/2015,"mind blown on meeting minutes ""delay"" this time.i think the evil-opedia is awesome with loads of info, and the search feature works much better than in these forums, where, only single keyword searches seem to work. (for most forum searching, i have to go to eve-search.) please overhaul the mail client, eve-gate and in-game. search in there is needed. i'd like table support, too.or contract it out to an external mail provider that will add some minimal crest integration, where the wheel is already invented, so we can have rich formatting. migrate user data and give all players an account there [character name].eve-online@[external provider name]"

1/22/2015,as far as the removal of attributes so a players will not be locked in to a slow train of skills eve is hard and that is apart on why it's fun unlike other games eve is real when i started playing i didn't know how much i would grow up in 3 years a lot of it was due to screwing up my attributes 3 times lol but i knew what i wanted to do in eve and i think i'm pretty good at it so no i don't think it's a good idea to remove it but have a better guide for it in some way still keeps the ability to screw it up also really liked that the lachesis has 4 lows and now that ive played with the fit not having the hac resists are ok the pilgrim feels a bit weaker then it should be by a hair my need a look at but the reason i'm saying it here is i like that the feedback from players and devs were fast and were heard and the changes with the new releases are nice i think a lot of players like it and some miss the old way where there were climactic videos about them
1/22/2015,"i see you covered skins already, but no mention was made of what people think of the mechanic of how they are applied to your character versus being an item that blows up/drops/etc from the ships themselves.there's a very lively discussion that ccp stopped participating in over in the thread discussing skins once we asked why they aren't fittings on ships.how about the csm represents this a little bit more for us players wanting to know why?i don't judge people by their race, religion, color, size, age, gender, or ethnicity. i judge them by their grammar, spelling, syntax, punctuation, clarity of expression, and logical consistency."

1/22/2015,"there is a potential danger here:in the future aurum could become part of the cost to manufacture or acquire ingame items that do not currently use aurum(a nice way to circumvent current ingame items and associated costs is to re-balance them, including naming, in the future)or:in the future aurum will become a time-based currency in that it can be obtained from certain missions, added to the bounty system, or tied into factional warfare and it then can fall under player manipulation like the plex market, which ccp confirmed as happening just like any other item in game."
1/22/2015,if it's for something which has an in game mechanics effect (cosmetic doesn't count) it will not be sold for aurum.
1/22/2015,"i agree removing attributes is a good idea, and it also removes any possibility for ccp to one day sell neural remaps for aurum.source: plex for neural remaps a possibility again?also: one reason for using player appointed attribute points is to give the player a sense of control over their character and his/her development and forces them to make decisions about where to spend them.removing attributes from skill training time helps both new players and vets, who fly in null/wh space."

1/22/2015,"two things you should look at regarding the npe,1) map wasd to movement by default. having a new player having to map it themselves is confusing and does not help s new player. make it the default setting upon eve online installation.2) the default overviews need to be better. ccp needs to redo their defaults to be more functional. also by default, all 5 tabs should be used vs the current 1."

1/22/2015,"we did ask, minutes aren't a transcrip just a summary."
1/22/2015,thank you very much for typing the minutes ccp logibro source:
1/22/2015,thanks for the text version. this is exactly right imho:i think achievements would be a useful addition.
1/22/2015,"my cruiser team will beat your burner cruiser teams, fozzie. if you do this, you'd better make them scary.ccp bettik best ccppve, and missions... it's the right type of interaction with the game for people who haven't decided on a group to join. it's also a placeholder / holding pattern activity while players ""level up their raven"" in an attempt to make themselves ""worthy"" before seeking to join a bigger group. the content is stale right now, but somehow i think it's still enough to keep the occasional-login player's interest. it fits in as a minigame while skill queuing. i ran level 1 and 2 missions for my first two years, just for something to do while off-duty.that's kind of cool. i +1 this as a way of indicating game life in the player's vicinity. feedback for actions. the rate might be similar to jita local, but if it's important information it is possible for it to capture the player's attention like a stock ticker. if it announces rule-breaking, that's a bit better to interested parties, than a relatively mild blinking square in local.the ui plans are not hopeful. still failing to assimilate and interpret your own game."
1/22/2015,"i'd really like it if chat channels had some kind of sound notification of new messages. so for example, have the sound team create 3-4 chimes and let us chose which channel we want which chime to play on, (if we want chimes to play at all)"
1/22/2015,"""he [ccp tomb] noted that the npc creation system had essentially not been changed since eve has started. however now a new template system has been created streamlining the process considerably. this allows a game designer to select a ship ""hull"" and fit it with pre-made attribute sets.""going with the whole ""dynamic world based"" idea over instance type model, wouldn't it make more sense for npc creation and mechanics to be the exact same as fitting a player ship, where random utility slots could produce variations according to the npc type, but still using real word modules (and whatever is fitted drops as though it were a pvp kill)?the remaining attributes to fill out would be the blackboard behaviors mentioned earlier, defining how they behave and organize to do stuffs. blackboard - a blackboard is a way for them to share their intentions with each other. they have a shared blackboard where if one of the npcs posts a location or primary target, they will behave like a well organised fleet following their fcs commands.once tweaked, the ""blackboard"" modeling of npcs can reduce the numbers required for them to be effective and could eliminate the bloat and oddity of killing cores and scores of red crosses in a mining like fashion. bounties could be raised and npc farming can more closely simulate normal pvp and create dynamic content at the same time. might as well even have them have to hold sov like we do, and attack and defend in a similar fashion...talk about dynamic content ;)they could have to mine and defend against those pod pilot rats that keep trying to kill their miners etc etc etc...just sayin..."

1/22/2015,"here's something that should of been talked about with team pirate unicorns concerning the new player experience & retention of these players;the fact that many of these players are getting frustrated, with what content is offered to them & how they can achieve a sustainable source of income.once players get past the tutorial missions & progress to low level missions they soon find:* the rewards they can receive from completing these missions are hopelessly out dated in comparison to modern day market prices. they might of been fine when eve first started, but they are pathetic by today's market standards.* new players get frustrated from having to go through numerous repetitions of running the same set of missions for a agent over and over again whilst trying to make isk. even if they do decide, to go to another high sec region and try missions for a different agent of the same type, they find that there is still little to no difference in the storyline, the objectives &/or the rewards on offer to complete the missions. this creates a barrier for some, who don't want wait for their skills to improve sufficently to a point where they feel comfortable with moving out of empire to either low sec or nul sec where the rewards from missions & anoms are much, much better. so in the end they get bored & frustrated with eve fast & end up leaving.there has to be a way to improve & make the missions each agent offers, more unique & immersive, as well as improving the rewards on offer for missions, so these players don't feel like they are wasting their time and getting nowhere fast.a new story line mission idea, that might help in opening their eyes to what's possible, could be something like;for a 72hr time period;the npe finds they have been somehow conscripted into an empire navy, they see short video of their ship being magically titan bridged to a non player accessible area of low or nul sec, where they see themselves docking at a station & they are given a number of prefitted ships together with the skills to fly them. they receive a list of objectives from an npc fc, that they must attempt to complete, the idea behind the tasks is to show off what's on offer in this type of space, as they patrol it. ideally it should show them the difference in risk vs reward from empire thru to nul sec & also serve as a kind of tutorial for fleet op's.it could also give npe's chance to actually see a variety of ships like; frigates thru to battleships, carriers, rorqual's, super's & titans in an ingame enviroment, that, they might not otherwise get to see, if they up & quit eve.hopefully more dynamic missions in conjunction with a rebalance of mission rewards, could serve as a possible means of an improved source of income & provide them with inspiration & drive, to set lofty goals of being apart of the low / nul sec communities, should they choose to do so. whereby they could someday obtain & fly their own copy of the ships they saw out there in their mission."
1/22/2015,"""sion then talked about something along the lines of a rotating corporate task list that players could complete and get a reward. ccp rise liked the idea and had previously been talking about stuff and had been thinking of the opportunities for corporations to use this tracking system to organize themselves and reward their players.""omg this all day, yes, this would help greatly getting corp stuff done!!! one could argue that contracts can do this, but they are a peta and having a dedicated task list has so much more potential."
1/22/2015,"- pvpers earn their isk typically by having to do pve, yes. but pve uses the skills they've already trained for pvp (ratting/deding/incursions). an industrialist/miner will not have combat skills. so they must do what? 1. train as a combat pilot first bef"
1/22/2015,"yes, google does.but some sort of tag-system could clean it up even more...specially if when your creating your post, that you had to tag it first. and it would bring up a list of post already on that topic.""the lord loosed upon them his fierce anger all of his fury and rage. he dispatched against them a band of avenging angels"" - the scriptures, book ii, apocalypse 10:1 #npclivesmatter #freetheboobs"
1/22/2015,because we need less hot drops and more ratting carriers.
1/22/2015,"actually, smaller/slower hotdrops will lead to more ratting carriers which will lead to more (in total) hotdrops."
1/22/2015,"i tackle your carrier in one ship, light a cyno. 5 guys jump through, each one has a cyno, 25 guys jump in. each one has a cyno, 125 guys jump in....so it's a bad idea, but also a bad idea that wouldn't work."
1/22/2015,31 weaker enemies on the field.
1/22/2015,there's already jump fatigue. why not just make all of eve highsec =/
1/22/2015,"i am in null.when i see reds coming on intel channels - know what i do?i dock up!yup, i dock right up.then i undock in a covert ship. why? being in a covert cloak ship is better than being in a station.everyone knows it is over powered. it needs to change."
1/22/2015,"what?! that's a horrible argument. and who is ""everyone?"""
1/22/2015,try take those sunglasses off and think a bit before you argue so blindly. refute the reasons why i prefer a covert ship over a station.
1/22/2015,because you can get eyes on your enemy. so what? that's overpowered?
1/22/2015,again. a quick reply with very little thinking and only one benefit or use mentioned.
1/22/2015,it's not my job to list every single way that you think cloaks are overpowered. it's yours. it's called your campaign because it's yours.
1/22/2015,"already done, multiple times in multiple places and multiple times with you. is your goal in life to waste people's time?"
1/22/2015,from here. even a goon is not so blind.
1/22/2015,"then clearly your issue is the cyno, not the cloak. how can you complain about what intel a cloaked ship can gain when you have local as the perfect intel tool?with all do respect, you're a pver, a miner, an industrialists, etc. and that's fine. but it really sounds like you're trying to bring a little too much highsec into my null/lowsec. if you have a problem with afk cloakers and cynos...why not just play in highsec?for you to claim that the mechanic is over powered, you'd actually have to show some strong stats. back when drakes and hurricanes were the ships to fly in 0.0, there was real stats backing up why they were over powered. when every capital fight summoned everyone with a cyno from literally all over new eden, you could see that was a game breaking problem. even isthars today are a bit of an issue. but as far as cloaky ship and hot dropping goes, there's no stats backing this up. miners aren't dying in droves. people are still doing their ratting just fine.here let's see if you can answer this question. for every 10 ratting or mining ships out there flying in a non hs area of eve, how many get hot dropped? if it's such an issue you need to actually back up your argument with some statistics or something. because right now, it honestly just looks like someone that does pve complaining about someone doing pvp."
1/22/2015,"it is too logically evident to me to believe it needs that effort. so, counter argument. disprove it. give me stats on how many hours miners and ratters don't stay docked up, move to another system or are playing another game when there is an afk cloaker in their home system."
1/22/2015,"once again, i would respectfully remind you that the burden of proof is on you as a csm candidate to prove your point."
1/22/2015,"that's the tl;dr of their entire post history, dude. ""playing the wrong game"" has rarely fit anyone better."
1/22/2015,"easy solution: delay before you can light a cyno after jumping to one.before you say something can't work, stop and ask yourself if you have closed off all of the possibilities. if you don't have special training in this field of mental brainstorming work, you're probably better off with the simple mantra: never say it's impossible."
1/22/2015,"perhaps not everyone, per se, but i'd figure a large percentage of the pvpers i know who have flown a covert ship would agree to this.perhaps if you had been reading jenshae's posting history, you'd notice she's come a long way. where i once saw a lot of blind hatred toward nullsec, i now see a much more informed view. jenshae was once a rookie but will perhaps someday be a bitter vet. i think you spend too much time assuming people never change and should perhaps check back once in a while before you make accusations about someone that might no longer be true. also, constructive criticism is always many times more helpful than destructive criticism."
1/22/2015,"""the wheel is round!"" ""no! no! no! i demand you waste your time to do a three year investigation with proof of it rolling down different hills, that you find a new way to calculate pi and then prove to me how round it is compared to a square!""that is how absurd this seems to me. ""i must hold onto the hate! it is the best tool for channeling my energies and controlling the force! ""seriously, though, if i end up being one of the csm, i need to hold onto a little bit of everything i can. confusion, indignation and that annoyance that took me to the brink of deleting eve forever; are some of the tools to empathise with newbies, for example.(maybe ccp should make some innuendo statement, such as, ""do not worry, it hurts the most the first time but soon you will enjoy it,"" as a pop up when someone dies to another player for the first time."
1/22/2015,"i think this also applies. actually, there is a pretty simple solution to what seraph believes would happen of exponential cynos - cool down timer before someone that just jumped until they can generate a point for someone to jump to them."
1/22/2015,cloaked inte gatherer is rare? where's the proof? and how is someone who is actually afk going to hurt you? i don't see the argument here. we are arguing what ifs. the afk cloaky camper argument is like arguing with code over ganking. if your scared to play because someone is cloaked then he is doing his job.
1/22/2015,"congrats, you've just ruined a mechanic completely. you'll find no one to support this except other carebears. by all means go ask literally any 0.0 nullsec candidate or current csm member since you have ""special training in the field of mental brainstorming work."" go on i'll wait.are most of them in test alliance? if it's so easy to do as proving the wheel is round, surely even you can do that. it's not a crazy idea to back up your statements with actual facts."
1/22/2015,"i only want a pilot jump limit and re-cyno delay on covert cynos, but that's beside the point. i was pointing out that you were being to quick to seal the idea off as not possibly working. go ahead and disagree with it, or pick out problems with it. but you should slow down a bit before dropping accusations that it's ill-conceived from the ground up and couldn't possibly be further balanced to work decently. i hope not. most of us are able to find ways to die even while cloaked.the burden of proof always lies on the one making an extraordinary claim, regardless of political position. sourcei'm not really sure who was making extraordinary claims as i can't really tell what you guys were going on about for sure."
1/22/2015,"if anyone needs local numerical superiority it's covert cyno ships that are much less tanky than conventional ships. it isn't that i didn't think through the possibilities, it's that i did and still saw how bad they were.since the current game mechanics are the norm, and jen wants to change them, i'd imagine he's making the extraordinary claims. when slowcats were rebalanced, when blaptitans were rebalanced, when drakes and canes were rebalanaced, people provided stats to back their argument."
1/22/2015,i think we are getting away from jen's campaign.
1/22/2015,"no need for me to have original thought when i can just add to kaarous' can't speak for the rest of the pve community, but -1 from this one as well."

1/22/2015,i mean all the candidates have great ideas!
1/22/2015,"listened to your interview with capstable, you're very well spoken and made your point well. +1"
1/22/2015,"oh wow, wasn't expecting that to be ready so quickly. thanks to the folks at cap stable for both putting up with me, and being so quick at posting it."
1/22/2015,"that's yet to be evidenced as true. as it stand it looks like conflict wont actually be introduced until they change the way sov is taken and held. in an ideal world, yes, removing jumping will create conflict, but in realism it's just making people not bother to travel long distances to fight, while still leaving the threat that if you attack someone on their home turf they will drop capital fleets on your head, just now you can't call in backup from another group. it's certainly not a conflict driver.that said, it's secondary to the main point which is that automatically accepting and rejecting changes based purely on whether or not they are thought to increase or decrease conflict respectively is far too simple an idea and certainly not a healthy view for a csm member to take. a good idea is still a good idea even if it reduces conflict. retaining conflict is definitely something that should be considered, but it's not the sole factor in a good idea."
1/22/2015,"it's yet to be evidenced that the changes will lead to an increase in conflict (although judging by my personal sales of ships that are heavily exported to nullsec for fleet warfare, specifically ishtars and oneiroses, at least one large null bloc believes it will drive dconflict).however, the status quo was going to stifle conflict over time. the ability of 'apex forces' to appear in any fleet fight and whelp it unless another, larger apex force arrived was going to lead to a protracted cold war, which is imo not a healthy situation.in a choice between an uncertain future and a clearly bad one, i'd go with uncertainty. had i been on csm 9, my feedback for the phoebe changes would have been broadly positive. (this isn't claiming that they are perfect, just that they were better than inaction)."
1/22/2015,"while feyd is being a little dogmatic on purpose to highlight the many recent changes to the game that have indeed reduced conflict and therefore content (and have made the game more boring), his core point is correct - changes to the game should be considered primarily as to whether to promote conflict (perhaps i might qualify this as ""entertaining"" conflict). sure, there are some changes that do nothing to change the conflict in the game - re-skinning a ship for example, and there are other changes to the game where two reasonable people can disagree on whether the net effect will be more conflict or not - like the force projection changes, but at its core this game is primarily only interesting because of the direct conflict against, or competition with other players. you say a ""good idea"" is a still a ""good idea"" but ""good"" is a meaningless term unless you define what you are trying to achieve. can you actually name a change to this game that most people consider ""good"" but that actually decreased conflict between players? because this is a complex game sometimes a change can rebalance conflict or reduce it in one place but increase it elsewhere, but i think all the changes to the game considered ""good"" by most players have driven conflict overall, not reduced it. there are many ways to play eve, but almost all of them are only interesting because you live in a sandbox with other players. carebears can play on the test server and mine and build whatever they want in 100% safety but none of them do this because these activities are meaningless in the absence of the competitive sandbox around you. there is no actual use for your goods, not to mention no risk, so therefore there is no sense of accomplishment. conflict between players drives everything in this game, and therefore every change to game mechanics should be primarily considered as to whether it increases conflict or not, because otherwise the game becomes more boring and people will stop playing if there is no content/conflict to be had."
1/22/2015,"pedro is enlightened in his commentary. he 'gets it', both the spirit of the question, and of eve.the problem is that ccp itself has lost the plot here, and in blind pursuit of moar subs have clearly shown with each newly proposed nerf (like giving corps a 'no awoxing' switch, and 'social corporations' that cannot be wardecced...wtf?!) they are willing to sell their souls to the devil for a quick fix to achieve that.not achieved through more compelling content not through a better new player experience not through better education of newbros on the realities of eve life when they join no, ccp has decided to just turn off aggression in hisec, in slow paper cuts so people don't notice over time. do we content-creators just keep assuaging ourselves that 'this is just another small paper-cut infringement on our freedoms, we can live with it, we can just lay low and ride it out...after all, we still have ganking!' as if suicide ganking is the one and only measure of 'htfu' and 'sandbox' we weigh hisec content-creation by?we are going to wake up one day and realize hisec is a separate no-pvp shard of eve online, and every csm who should have been guarding against that over the years was asleep at the f#cking switch. the battle for eve's very soul is being waged, now, but our existing csm's and most players aren't even showing up to fight. carebears cheer in short-sightedness. null-bears cry tears that tora's guys are murdering them in hisec (while claiming l33tness for being in a null alliance?..).what we need is more sabriz (and tora) on the csm, and less mike asariah & sugar kyle. i submit, we don't need more trained-seal clapping applause to ccp nerfing and pansifying eve for the fapping pleasure of wow-rejects. we need sabriz (and tora) as counterpoint to those intentions, and hold the line.f"
1/22/2015,"in response to the suggestions for a halfway house between a player corp and an npc corp, because this seems to be a recurring thread, and i'm someone that has a history of nonstandard use of the corporation tools. for instance, for a long time i was an active supporter of code. alliance without being a member.firstly, it's my view that outside fw, an npc corp is nothing but the absence of a player corporation. this is mainly because you have no control over which npc corp you wind up in (except for a decision you make before creating your character). the functionality of the proposed 'corp lite' is really the same as the minerbumping chat channel in game (a moderated chat channel), except that a 'corp lite' would exclude people who are members of traditional player corps joining unless they are willing to leave their 'real corp'.this would allow someone interested in two or more activities to connect with other players and still make their own decision about whether to be in a player corp or not, rather than having to commit to a corp or 'corp-lite' that specialises in only one of those activities.there are benefits to making it easier to find other players with similar interests - but this should be done through improving and publicizing chat channels, not through reducing the consequences of corp membership. in particular, it should be easier to find chat channels aimed at an activity you are interested in. lots of channels exist - some are secret, others are open but just very hard to find out about, some are well known (the minerbumping channel for example, or whatever replaced the haulers channel after the original one changed ownership) and others are set up by ccp (the mining or recruitment channel)."
1/22/2015,"this is pretty far off what is currently being proposed and discussed by the csm. page 16 of the day 1 minutes speaks more about this subject, i recommend you give it a look iot familiarize yourself."
1/22/2015,"you mention in your capstable interview that people over the last 18 months have been leaving c1 to c5 to go to run incursions could you provide some more info on these numbers, facts that sort of thing.you mention that the corp on corp change will be a huge detriment to w space since they will all move to hisec and run incursion, if this was the case they would just do incursions in a npc so this change wouldnt effect them in anyway.could you give me a bit more info on how you think w space is doing its obviously going badly as you say.do you honestly think the corp on corp agression will totally ruin w space?you mention that you heavily endorsed funkybacon, how do you think he has done this year?"
1/22/2015,"sabriz, how would you feel about having a ""channel advertisement"" system similar to the corporation advertisements? as a follow up, how would you feel about seeing corporation advertisements on in game billboards and on the big screen in the captains quarters. (the what? that's a thing? i never go there...)"
1/22/2015,"i just reread it. the 'social group/societies' functionality in the minutes is something more in line with the minerbumping channel but with improved features (mailing list, fleet finder, etc). that's fine as it doesn't really compete with or interact with the corporation function. that's quite different to a lot of the 'corp lite' proposals that have been made independently of the csm which are for 'corporations' with immunity to wardecs and friendly fire, and with no rights to anchor structures. that idea would actively harm the game by reducing conflict drivers."
1/22/2015,"firstly, the only evidence i have as to the state of wh space is annecdotal, from my own visits there, from information from corp thieves that prey on wormholers, and the like. everyone i've spoken to indicates that c1 to c3 holes are quieter than they used to be without having had any major mechanical changes. c4s are quieter although they have also seen mechanical changes that make them harder to defend. c5/c6 cap esc fleet whelps tend to be big enough news to get an article on eve sites, and these articles are becoming less common.i'm confident that this annecdotal evidence is sufficient to say that wh space is presently in a decline that is neither at, nor near crisis proportions, and c6 holes are somewhat insulated. for players that use game theoretical methods to balance risk and reward to optimize returns, immunity to awox predation is another factor pulling them toward highsec mission and/or incursion grinding at the expense of wormhole pve. it's not clear if this is *the* tipping point, or if the actual tipping point will be another future change to highsec safety, but the single most viable way to kill marauders in highsec just disappeared from the game.i don't claim that large numbers will move out of wormholes on day 1, or that everyone will abandon wormholes over time. but the prevailing wisdom among pve players will shift over time in favor of running multiple accounts grinding incursions or missions in high, rather than running a smaller number of accounts running wormhole pve. reduce the number of prey and you will reduce the viabiltiy of predators - just look at the mess non-fw lowsec is in if you want to see what happens to space when, for a long period of time, it offers little to incentivise prey.some people will, of course, ignore any changes to the prevailing wisdom and will act in a game theoretically incorrect way due to their personal preference, just as some people continue to grind missions in dodixie 9-20 rather than the 'optimal' approach of doing missions for the sisters. these people might be enough to sustain an ecosystem in wormholes. time will tell.as for incursion runners in single-player or npc corps - i consider this a serious issue that needs fixing, and have proposals that would rebalance incursions payouts to make fielding a single corporation fleet (and possibly defending it from hostiles) viable."

1/22/2015,"2-3 years from now? at that point i feel it's reasonable to assume that corporation and alliance mechanics have been completely overhauled, and the sovereignty warfare redesign has been completed as well - which would have been my focus if the items in my platform were brought to a point where they could no longer be improved upon. what i would focus on after all of these things are completely done and perfected, would be wardecs. although you could consider this to be a part of the corporation and alliance mechanics, i doubt it'll receive the proper attention during the current development roadmap.i don't feel that there are enough highsec corporations and alliances that operate and compete with one another exclusively in highsec... and i blame this entirely on the current wardec system. highsec will be in a ""good place"" imho when the same depth of conflict, competition, and narrative can be seen in highsec as can be seen in sov null. allowing player run groups in highsec to form empires, and encouraging them to compete with one another is extremely important to me, and will do wonders to improve the health of the game. take the money and say ""welcome to eve"" ? real talk tho, money should never be the root incentive for people to help players - just putting that out there.anyway, the one thing about new players that frustrates me, is that they don't know enough about the sandbox to know what they're going to enjoy in the sandbox. this is partly why it irritates me that people are so quick to encourage new players to join groups like brave newbies - not that bni isn't a wonderful group and has a lot of systems in place to help new players - but that people are pigeonholing these new players into sov nullsec, which many consider to be the least fun part of the sandbox.if i were to have three days with a newbro, i'd show them as many different parts of the game world as i could. take them wormhole diving, try and fight fw plexers, gank a few miners, run a few mission.... show them the depth of the game, and let them decide where they want to set up camp and thrive within the sandbox. to this end, e-uni does a great job, and after the 3 days i'd recommend the new player go there until they've found themselves. you would think this comes with a rather complicated answer, but it's really quite simple.in ccp seagull's keynote speech, she discussed designing for unintended consequences within new eden, saying that: ""if we can predict what is going to happen, [the players] can predict what's going to happen - and [the players] are smarter than us.""the playerbase is extremely intelligent, the bloggers are outspoken and knowledgeable, and the subreddit and news sites allow for both discussion and dissemination of information. in a situation where there is a controversy regarding a change to the game - or anything really - it's important to make sure that constructive discussion is taking place and that the community knows what's happening and why. regardless of whether or not i agree with a controversial change, it's the csm's job to represent the players. that means facilitating the discussion within the playerbase, correcting any misunderstandings, and taking that feedback to ccp."

1/22/2015,"offline pos towers are a menace to all security levels of space.the amount of offline pos structures that can be found in all corners of highsec space alone can be annoying to any pilot wanting to throw down their own tent.i think this is one of the important issue that needs to be discussed with ccp, this is easily in my top 5."
1/22/2015,share your ideas about updating combat boosters and what you would do to make them a bigger part of eve.
1/22/2015,"vic came into my home system yesterday just to campaign his ideas even though we dont get along in game all to frequently :) but his ideas i believe are spot on, and taking the time to respond to everyone who has questions just shows dedication that is needed in a csm member. i am tres pein and i support this message."
1/22/2015,grrr goons grrr goons you are adopted and nobody loves you......... sorry had to say something negative before i can give him a positive as much as it pains me to say this ill vote for you..... i think generating content for systems other then high sec will bring lots of fun into the game. i also agree that the systems we base out of for the risk don't generate as much isk as they should. we have brawls with these boys all the time and i don't think he is pushing for things that only benefit his alliance. more content is a win in my book!
1/22/2015,just for crits interview:
1/22/2015,other orgs can't even fathom the possibility of one of their rookies running for csm.
1/22/2015,haha i can only hope.
1/22/2015,i have only know pant's for a short period of time. however on behalf of jpeg i would be honored to endorse his candidacy. we came to this alliance only a few months ago after folding our corp for a couple of years. since coming here i have watched pant's turn what was a pretty fail alliance when we got here into what is becoming a very respectable pvp alliance. he has a very competent leadership style and will be a strong voice for all parts of eve especially for the smaller alliances whose concerns are different than some of the larger blocks. he will bring a balanced viewpoint to the csm and not always side with the big alliances. pant's is his own man and he has my respect which does not come easily.give him your vote and you will not be disappointed.0/aruthaceo jian products engineering group
1/22/2015,"in response to several items, anyone knows me in our out of game, knows i do what i want when i want.point 1.skelly leadership being forced or asked to help with positive feedback.i do not as a general practice speak or give opinions on players publicly. as a part of skeleton crew leadership, i have not received anything more than a notice that pants was running for csm, nothing more. to my knowledge he has not asked one person within the alliance to help with his candidacy in anyway. point 2. flying of the handle at players is not a disqualification for csm, two names should sum this up. progodledgend, sort dragon. point 3. i do not have personal first hand knowledge of what transpired in pantsu fans previous alliances. i do know that quite a few of the pilots that got scammed, lost their stuff, ect. are flying with him again. i am sure there are those who are still bitter. point 4. i think pants does listen, he just does not try to keep everyone happy, just because you tell him something does not mean he has to or even needs to follow it up. he is very passionate, he is one of the few leaders who have stepped up to help make content. he is striving to make a difference. that passion inspires me.why would i think he would make a good csm- his passion for the game and his stubbornness will give him that standpoint of not going with the flow just because it is flowing. i do not think he will go with popular opinion just because it is the popular opinion. is pants the perfect candidate? no none of them are, i do think he is better than average person running,"
1/22/2015,+1 to pantsufan.he is a very kind man.he cares peoples need what.he loves help people.
1/22/2015,i endorse pants on this. he will represent null-sec players well.
1/22/2015,removed some off topic posts.
1/22/2015,"i figured what the heck...greetings all,i have decided to throw my hat into the ring for csm x. i'm not going to make any random promises that i know i have no power to do, but i figured i should tell you all why you should vote for me.i'm a near 11 year vet of eve, came here from another game (earth and beyond) and have not left.i have ran two alliances, lived in hs, ls, null and w-space. i have been an alliance head, and diplomat, as well as a line man for one of the first alliances in eve, ascn. with that said, my expertise falls in the following categories:corp and alliances, management, recruitment, etc,pos's, setting up, running, defending, fueling, and losing.and mining.things i'm not an expert in but can do consist of:wormholesindustrymissionsexplorationsov warfarethings i... mmm suck inpvpmy main goals as a csm is to represent the all around player, small corps and alliances, but mostly miners. i think the mining mechanic and game play has plenty of room for improvements, and i'd love to see it get some love. mining was the things that got me hooked on eve nearly 11 years ago, and i think its high time it got a bit more then just polish. mining could be improved by adding new game play elements, such as comet mining, ring mining, and making moon mining into an active mining feature as opposed to the passive mining it is now. this would be done by removing all moon goo from moons and placing them in comets as well as new ring mining locations. in addition the rorq should gain new abilities and become more of a capital mining platform and flag ship for large mining fleets.pos' should become more like the old module pos idea form a few years ago, and more like mini stations.so ama,"
1/22/2015,never mined in my life but i think having someone that can focus on the backbone of all industry would be extremely helpful.
1/22/2015,"i'm a long shot, but i figured i might as well try. and well mining really does need some love. it has not changed much in a long time."
1/22/2015,why does it matter if he's amarr fw?
1/22/2015,not wishing to derail the thread too much it is a question of soft power.i always enjoy reading your articles seraph its a shame you don't discuss low sec much. you know that wars are not won by pilot skill and military might alone. my question is what is md offering as an agenda for faction warfare and low sec that would make minnie militia pilots vote for him despite the assumed downsides of an amarr representative being on csm for us.namely:1) amarr militia having a direct advocate with the devs2) amarr militia gaining more publicity from a successful election campaign presumably boosting their recruitment3) amarr militia having the opportunity to lobby for issues that may influence our warzones little eco-system in their favour (and by definition to minni militias disadvantage)4) all the reasons why cfc pilots are unlikely to pick an ncdot candidate as their first choice and vice versa.in summary what is mds election platform? is he representing the interests of amarr militia or fw in general? if fw in general what would md say to any tlf pilots who may be turned off voting for him due to his faction allegiance?
1/22/2015,what possible solutions do you see to get new players out to nullsec quicker?
1/22/2015,"as i said above, wormholes.elaborating on that, i think newbros don't get out to nullsec because: they think it's too dangerous for them. they don't know anyone out there. it's too far away from their homebase. if the constant gatecamps in hed-gp are anything to go by, gates between losec and nullsec are popular camping grounds. encouraging & teaching them how to use wormholes early on takes care of problems 3 & 4. solving problem 1 would require some prodding, such as a hisec mission that requires them to get a sample of arkanor or spodumain from nullsec, thus showing them they can survive long enough to swipe some valuables if they're careful. that encourages them to visit nullsec through wormholes whenever they feel daring. problem 2 is solved with a mixture of active newbro recruitment by nullsec coalitions and the organic process of attackers chatting you up after they explode your t1 frigate for trespassing."
1/22/2015,"fixed that for you.i'm always interested in supporting new players. as i've said elsewhere, i ask questions less to get answers and more to see how candidates think. so:have you seen ccp rise's presentation on a tentative new approach to the npe? if not, i highly recommend it, especially as background for the dev blog that the just-published minutes advertise as forthcoming.how does this approach strike you? if asked for feedback as a csm, what would you say?again, i'm more interested in your thinking aloud than in ~answers~. i expect answers to change in light of newer and better information than ccp makes public."
1/22/2015,"no i haven't seen that yet; i watched their presentation from evefest in iceland a half-year earlier.-03:00: discuss prospect of third-partying timers in 200-maulus fleets with other jr fcs. ""we damp everyone!"" attribute it to irrational hatred of artillery fits from overexposure.-01:00: imagine talwar dance number to dillon francis's messages.00:00: actually start video.00:30: you're responsible for ishtars online! *shakes fist*05:47: noticed advanced tooltip for recharge time at right of slide; did i somehow miss it in-game? boot game quick to see; it didn't come up, so either it's not implemented yet or i'm missing a preference somewhere.07:20: personal idea for improving tooltips: option for showing quick tooltip of shiptype traits when moused over in overview. would help with slowly memorizing strengths/weaknesses of each shiptype. keep it separate from get info window.08:00: notifications have been satisfactory so far, aside from the weird way insurance-expired notifications pop; they only pop up when you check insurance. really think ships with no insurance should have symbol next to them in ship hangar inventory window. (might be issue for people that don't purposely insure ships- perhaps let them opt out of insuring a ship to remove symbol?)looking over insurance windows in-game reminds me of so many other annoying things. from/to dates on ship insurance window could probably be removed; all i want to know is the insurance level and how many days are left. insurance levels could probably use compacting, too; bet 95% of insurance is either basic or platinum. why are there 6 different levels of insurance? at which point would i actually want to get silver insurance instead of basic or platinum?10:13: mention of killmails reminded me i wished there was a way to get killmails even if you didn't land the killing blow (in-game; not counting zkillboard and other 3rd-party apps here). i'd like it if the killmails were cleaned up period; hard to tell exactly who did what with every enemy's damage/ewar compressed into just one icon. multiple icons per ship, separating guns from drones from ewar? always hated it when i'm looking over a killmail and there's an entry that makes no sense, like a ship doing damage with itself.get into sidethought of how annoying it is zkillboard doesn't let you narrow down searches with and conditions like ""member of pl and died in hed-gp"". double-check zkillboard to make sure there isn't an option to do just that i overlooked before i post this up and reveal my ignorance to the world. there doesn't seem to be. *whew*12:30: discussion of transferring tutorials to opportunities, and the testing involved, is where things are getting interesting. discussion of thinking being rooted to the tutorial, since it was in there so long, also interesting. debating how, and whether, players could set up the opportunities themselves. leads to thinking of opportunities for ""pick-up groups"" the recently announced changes to in-corp awoxing could make. initial thoughts are of a lowsec mercenary group putting up contracts in hisec for players to help them in faction wars, using the game's mechanics somehow to automatically pay them for helping out.could be rather tricky to implement, but i like the idea of setting up a simple system for a player to be temporarily aligned to another player group, do mercenary work for them, and automatically get paid as a result. would also encourage new players to travel out of hisec to complete a job. conversion of current npc-driven mission structure to a variation of the contract system where other players can post detailed job offers / requests could be a good way of getting that 40% of new players who get isolated doing missions by themselves more involved with other player groups. goal is to have as little npc involvement as possible.idly think of one forumer's ""f*ck the newbros"" message, convert it to a philosophy of ""f*ck the npcs"" instead.(that and trial accounts should be able to use contracts. i subscribed early solely to use them.)13:45: still nothing about wormholes on the opportunity goals.15:00: i would laugh about the window covering the vital destination info, if i wasn't well aware of the many times i've accidently hidden stuff behind windows myself.17:55: ""people are smart and figure things out quickly."" weird to hear after several tales of people getting confused by very basic eve mechanics, until you realize people can figure out 90% of things on their own, but that last 10% is often wildly different for everyone.20:20: i didn't even know you could shoot the billboards.(continuing this in next post because i ran out of characters in this one.)"
1/22/2015,"well, i had the 2nd part of this written up and accidently force-closed the window, which means it's now time for the ultra-compact hopefully-complete too long;didn't post version:the emphasis on planets reminded me of how much work it was for me to set up my efficient pi chains, which is probably not what you want for a system that's great for providing newbros cheap isk. instead of forcing players to haul out a command center in an industrial, why not just have them pay the customs office x amount of isk to establish one on the planet below?i also want a way to simplify setting up the pis, like automatically filling out routes (if there's only one link connected to an extractor, odds are the resources are going down it) and providing charts of what builds into what. (i personally jotted down notes on several sheets of grid paper figuring that all out; i'll admit that was probably a tad overboard.)discussion of wasd space travel and double-clicking in space made me realize i want a line showing my path to show up when i click on a destination like that. this led to thinking about how unwieldy the current orbiting mechanic is, and how nice it'd be if it displayed your orbit and its angle, and then let you tweak your trajectory into orbit.i'd also like it if collision spheres could be displayed. stupid asteroids...permadeath scares me. but after listening to his explanation of its mechanics, i'm beginning to come around on it.as for my opinion on their proposed path for improving the game for newbros, i whole-heartedly approve. it sounds like they have a good idea how they want to improve it, yet are doing enough testing to make sure it's actually working. if anything, i'd say they aren't shooting high enough yet; i want to see opportunities concerning pi, faction warfare, and wormholes as well.a tad more concise than i originally planned, but it's getting late here and i need to crash for the night. hopefully that answers your questions."
1/22/2015,"yes, that is a humongous barrier to newbros getting out of hisec and into lowsec/nullsec. if brave had gamblers, we'd probably put the odds of a newbro successfully surviving the trip from hisec to catch in a ship that isn't a travel inty at 1-in-15. it's even sadder when the newbros themselves don't realize how dangerous it is, and it takes me 5 minutes of flailing my arms and shouting ""stop!"" for them to realize that making the trip in a cruiser they spent all their isk on is not the best idea.the early plethora of rewards newbros get from the tutorials is also an issue, as it gives them stuff that ties them to their starting system right off the bat. that makes it extremely hard to convince them to restation themselves... well, anywhere else. i've talked about 12 newbros through moving from hisec to catch, and 10 of those times involved a conversation along these lines:""alright, first, you should sell everything you have- no, don't panic, it's not actually that much- no, 3 million isk is not a lot of money. just calm down, you can buy all that stuff out here- no, don't try to fly it all out here! you'll lose it for sure! look, there's these things called gatecamps...""in addition to emphasizing the use of wormholes to go to lowsec/nullsec, it might be nice if the tutorial gave you coupons you could redeem at any time/station later for the modules/ships, rather than automatically delivering them to your starting station. that would keep newbros less tied to their starting station and hisec in general, encouraging them to explore (and welp rookie ships) more often.actually, as i ponder welping rookie ships (and how often i welped in my first week of playing), i think the best reward for completing the initial tutorial/opportunities would be unlimited t1 ships/modules to welp for a week. it would be difficult to make it so people couldn't exploit that to flood the market*, but i think that would encourage the kind of reckless abandon and experimentation newbros need to try everything the sandbox has to offer and start finding out what they like.*on second thought, it wouldn't be that difficult. ccp would just have to treat it more like other mmos' respawn systems than eve's usual ""die and lose all your stuff"" process. attempts to get rich off exploiting the constant replacement could be stymied with these 2 mechanics: your replacement ship is exactly the same as the ship you lost. filled with rigs and modules? they're all there. completely empty because you sold/stripped all your modules? your replacement ship is empty, too. everything on the ship is destroyed along with the ship itself, rather than some of it being lootable. this prevents people from having a friend blow them up and splitting the profits from selling the reimbursed modules. not sure how much extra coding that would involve, or how much that would break players' immersion in the game, but i definitely think a period of ""reckless abandon"" for new players starting out would be useful for getting them to experiment, explore, and find their niche rather than settling into the comfortable risk-averse rut of earning isk from hisec missions."

1/23/2015,"i dont, fatigue is fatigue, it should be a simple specific rule set ""you jump, you get fatigue"", no ""buts"" afterand i personally cant wait for more nullsec changes and the eventual removal/nerf of the jf/etc fatigue bonuses"
1/23/2015,"except that idea leaves anyone who lives on the regional borders being shat on from two sides. entities that live further into the region can simply drop whenever they want, just like the old times, and the guys on the other side of the border just jump up to the line and step across.it ensures that each region has one and only one power bloc living in it and no-one else can get a foothold."
1/23/2015,start fleet on far side of region a. fatigue = zerocyno jump right across region a to the gate to region b (no fatigue)jump through gate to region b. cyno jump right across region b to the gate to region c (no fatigue)...arrive in region z with no jump fatigue.
1/23/2015,"wormholes please do so, it isn't just new players that need it, there is allot of older players as well that would benefit from it too. ui modernization projectfor the love of god, please increase the maximum number of ship fittings in the fitting management window. also please, increase the maximum number of in game mails that you can trash/delete at a single time. customer supporti think its pretty obvious, that the whole petition, ticket system needs to be better explained to players & expanded on.often players are confused about what catergory there problem should be filed under & they file under the wrong option.it not only leads to delays in the player getting a response from the gm, but also has to frustrate the gm's as well.please expand the support ticket window and give it the ability to create/insert a link.sometimes a screen shot speaks a thousand words, if the player just happened to be frapsing at time, a short replay of what happened as seen by the player, could be handy.thanks."
1/23/2015,"i can't help thinking part of the disconnect is the constant referral to 10,000 foot view user statistics. how often do devs have to start new characters to experience everything over again? sure, most of a dev's energy is devoted to dev work, rather than playing for the countless hours like the player base, but shouldn't there be more of an emphasis on repeated, first-hand npe experience rather than trying to balance by broad statistics (that aren't really indicative of a specific player story)?"
1/23/2015,"they do also do user testing. generally not with ccp devs, as a dev is the worst person to test their own code (as they know how it works).testing with gamers, who haven't played eve before."
1/23/2015,"there's no shortage of frustration for me, especially having done things several times, so i hope that's not a no. i don't know how to argue against ""there's a stat for that,"" when a player story is the most important thing."
1/23/2015,would love to see those numbers how many w-space residents we currently have? :)
1/23/2015,"dear ccp, dear csm,you spoke about ""social clubs"" or ""societies"" page 17.simplier, i would suggest to speak about organizations.we have players or non players corporations or alliances.there are non players organizations (soe for example) but no players organizations.they would allow to gather players who have a same objective without breaking their freedom to be in a corporation or to be solo.and we would use like this a concept that already exists in eve but not available for players.why shouldn't we be able to build a soe type organization in game ?good summit and best regards."
1/23/2015,that is what the societies are. player made groupings and tools to facilitate them.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>
1/23/2015,"can you explain the difference you see, between what you're suggesting, and the 'social clubs' that have been talked about?the idea has always been that they're for organisation of players, across corporation lines. like rvb ganked, spectre fleet, and so on."
1/23/2015,"dear mike, dear steve,i agree that what you proposed as ""social clubs"" or ""societies"" correspond to what i call ""organizations"".i was just suggesting not to use another name for something that already exists in game but for np only.eve is enough complicated so that we shouldn't use another word.moreover, today, the ""corporations, alliances & organizations discussions"" forum is forbidden for non alliance/corporation members. if we give the name ""organizations"" to what you call ""societies"" or ""social clubs"", i see no reason not to open it now. we should call a spade a spade.best regards and thanks for your work."
1/23/2015,\o/ hooray for raw text on phones.
1/23/2015,i think he just wants to say that organisations is a better term than societies or social clubs.
1/23/2015,"the word ""society"" might make some folks think of ""high society,"" a place where tea and cakes are served at noon, and everyone has to wear nice clothes. words like ""club, group, organization"" don't carry that possible connotation."
1/23/2015,"but the name does offer up the potential for ""secret societies"" no cake there, cake is a lie."

1/23/2015,nda sucks :p
1/23/2015,"nice, any new pve content is welcome"
1/23/2015,this is awesome to see the minutes come out so fast. this shows me that ccp thinks the csm is important. i hope this trend continues.i am really liking the new ccp.
1/23/2015,"there is an elegant alternative for fleet warp that i think most people will like, but sikrit for now, because reasons."
1/23/2015,"the csm did a wonderful job, and credit to ccp too, for the last minutes.i do love the near instant minutes though, whilst they are not as complete, i look forward each day with great interest.ah, choices, do i want instant gratification, or detailed reporting?both is too much to hope for. maybe a more detailed version could be a forum thread, dripped in over the next few months?nope, that is asking for our csm to do just too much, they are already doing trojan work!but maybe when nda is removed from sections, they could be reported in full?thanks all."
1/23/2015,"this sentence made me actually laugh out loud.also, why the fear of changing ishtars? what makes sentry ishtars so different that they have to be treated so carefully? other things seem to be nerfed/buffed without this level of trepidation."
1/23/2015,"reviewing the forums in general wouldn't be a bad idea. granted, the resources may not be available for a broader forum overhaul, but having 38 subforums purely for eve (not counting dust/valk/foreign language) seems a bit excessive. they might need to be consolidated/merged rather than expanded further. it's not new player friendly, and it's marginalising certain subforums and topics because casual users can't be arsed rummaging through so many different areas.if you are monitoring specific threads in f&i an option might be to allow you to create your own folder headers within favourites? no idea how the techy side works, but quick fixes are probably more viable than large scale implementations."
1/23/2015,"yeah, she used to hate nullsec, now she hates pvp of any kind. i have seen her recently speak out against several things, and the only thing they had in common is that they all enable pvp of some kind.i see no merit whatsoever in their candidacy. so here's my endorsement. if you don't hate pvp of every kind, don't vote for the op. and i think a good player can never grow out of a bad attitude. and i still see that in spades.but so much less fun. nevermind that this is not an f&i suggestion, no matter how much it looks like one. this is the csm campaign. ""constructive"" criticism is quite simply not called for here. especially towards someone who rabidly refuses to answer any criticism with anything other than summary dismissals."
1/23/2015,"correction: not required, but it is recommendedbut i'm tired of dealing with ignorant folks and you have no excuse as we've been down this road enough times before, you and i. so i'll suffice to say that your accusations of jenshae are in fact factually inaccurate as is demonstrated by her more recent posts as well as her edits to the original csm 10 candidacy platform which you would know if you had read any of it."
1/23/2015,"but they can warp while cloaked. main reason i think covert cyno hotdrops should be limited in size is because they so easily evade intel that you never know if they're coming except when the system is completely free of non-blues. it seems unreasonable to me that one red in local could potentially turn into 250 reds in an instant and not at a gate or other beacon visible on the overview, and there's no way for you to calculate the probability with available intel.i would have limited the size to 10 ships per covert cyno, which is plenty enough for a good gank and to hold ground while waiting out a brief timer of, say, 1 minute until they can light a regular cyno or more covert cynos. also, easy way around the limitation is to bring multiple covert ops ships through the gates in the first place. depending on how that pans out, might have to limit to 5 per covert cyno after all, but i'm optimistic about it.a brief summary of views expressed in this thread, for comparison:jenshae chiroptera: the ease of forcing pvp upon an unwilling participant should be balanced with the unwilling participant's ability to prevent pvp. both parties should have to work toward their goal, and both should be given the tools to do so.most responders: we don't want you on csm because you are anti-pvp and you want themepark gameplay, but this is a pvp game and themepark gameplay should be marginalized to a strong degree.most supporters: themepark gameplay is currently over-marginalized and while pvp is acceptable, we want enough safety to make pve activities outside of highsec even viable at all.reaver glitterstim: jenshae's proposals have undergone many edits and reiterations since the original, and i recommend you all to take a look at what has changed. while i am only partially in support of jenshae's candidacy platform, that support is growing quickly and i am eager to see what she comes up with next. i suspect jenshae will make an excellent csm candidate in a later election."
1/23/2015,"activity draws attention and helps spread the campaign thread and message. the afk cloaker: - is perfectly safe- has the potential to drop at any moment- can not be evicted or hunted even in your home system.i am looking for ways that they need to play actively to get the benefits of what they do. they shouldn't get a free lunch in our home.(other posts, i will read fully and respond after some sleep)."
1/23/2015,"i did. i also reported her posting here in the first place, since she was doing this as a deliberate farce to advocate for the dissolution of the csm.and since you went ahead and reposted a tl;dr, it turns out i was right.my rebuttal.go back to wow. pvp is a fundamental part of eve, non consensual pvp included. there exist already more than enough means for prevention of pvp, in all areas of space. well, that is, if you use your whole ass.the op's candidacy exists solely to campaign for the right of people to play the game deliberately incorrectly and still be safe from harm.if you want a themepark, go play one. stop trying to shove that distasteful thing into my sandbox game, it is most unwelcome."
1/23/2015,"well said. an excellent example of some of the hypocrisy we see in common viewpoints about themepark gameplay. if it is wrong for pveers to avoid pvp with no ability to be pursued, then it is wrong for pvpers to avoid pvp with no ability to be pursued."
1/23/2015,"it's an excellent example of an obvious strawman, anyway.a pve player can just as easily cloak in a safe. nothing prevents them from doing this, it is not some exclusive activity, nor do you make money while doing so. in fact, you can't do a whole lot of anything.what pve players want, on the other hand, is to be safe while performing lucrative activities. that is 100% unacceptable."
1/23/2015,"this caught my eye before i closed the thread.reaver, waste no more time, energy or your finely crafted words on kaarous. (i have his posts hidden, told him openly that he is just a waste of my time and asked him to stop following me around the forums like a sulky child because i got his ""coup de gr<U+FFFD>ce""reversed).by his own admission, he is here for forum pvp. he does nothing to forward ideas, develop them or try and take eve as a whole forward."
1/23/2015,"here i will heed your wishes, but my normal response is to adamantly continue to treat all criticisms with a serious, honest, and direct tone and give them reasonable attention as if they were meaningful posts, whether or not i suspect them to be."
1/23/2015,"which is why you, of the two, have my respect. the person you're adhering to on the other hand displays astonishing intellectual dishonesty. even dinsdale was better than this."
1/23/2015,"and the defender can do the same, fit his own cyno, lay his trap.the type of gameplay you advocate gives less power to small groups, furthers a carebear mentality and cements the strength of powerblocs even more. i don't speak as a ""goon"" or an n3 member but as someone that flies in groups of 2-5 often dealing with enemies that are better equipped and numerically superior.my mind is eased knowing for certain such a mentality will never have a relevant voice in affecting eve's gameplay."
1/23/2015,"after reading the first page, i had the impression that the op was a troll on steroids and stopped reading the rest. so any good points you might have made after page 1 are wasted on me. if you want people to listen to you, you might want to consider making a more serious op."
1/23/2015,"i'm not convinced that is the case. an aggressor is not limited to ten covert aggressors total, but rather is limited to ten covert aggressors per covert cyno per minute. the major thing i see coming out of this is a small window to react to a covert hotdrop. anyone who wants to bypass it can merely use a non-covert hotdrop.this will make it easier to fly capital ships in small groups, which may or may not be used more by large alliances (probably will). this in turn will lead to capital deaths which will make it easier for small groups to roam free. i'm speculating here, i'm uncertain of the effects and i really do support anything that gives large blocs like test less power. we have plenty to share."
1/23/2015,nether could a station docker everywhere but your home system and if i really don't want u to remove me from your home system you never will. remove the cyno from everything smaller than a cruiser.
1/23/2015,"docking is not like cloaking, because a cloaked pilot (in a covert ops ship) can roam about and watch what's going on, gather intel, relay intel, set up for an ambush, and make plans. a docked player can only do what doesn't include gathering intel or moving into a strategic position."
1/23/2015,i can from dock see who's in systems cross check their kill boards to see what ships they most offten use. from there i can tell when these players gather they most offten do this. flying this. so now i know a fleet is being form. ok why would the form a fleet. well i know this timer here and here is about to pop. now i know if they are going for this timer they will have to travel here to get to the timer. ambush set. intel gathered
1/23/2015,"if you consider that intel to be on par with intel gathered from and strategic placement of ships in covert cloak, then you're just bad at using intel and strategic placement options."
1/23/2015,not as good yesbut when the cloak gets nerfed it will be the next thing you will be crying about
1/23/2015,are you sure about that? what's the last nerf i ever cried about?edit: startling realization on my part: i don't think i have ever disliked any nerfs thus far in eve.
1/23/2015,you was being used in the communal sense suh as you all sry i wasnt cleari don't personaly follow your every post
1/23/2015,i don't think most of jenshae's supporters will complain about covert cloak nerfs.
1/23/2015,"rephrase when cloaking gets nerfed , dock campers will be the next thing you will cry about."
1/23/2015,i'm interested to learn how dock campers are really all that scary.
1/23/2015,i feel the same way about cloakers
1/23/2015,"here's what you're having problems understanding though. both the attacker and the defender can use cloaked ships. if there is a tool in the game and i use it better than you, that's not the tool's fault. it's yours."
1/23/2015,"the way that the op responds to comments, whether he agrees with them or disagrees, shows me that he would be terrible member of the csm. summary dismissal of people without views other than your own is the exact opposite of what a good csm candidate needs to demonstrate. seeing how the op seems to think the csm should be dissolved anyways i think that anyone who is considering voting for him should seriously reconsider. there are other people who hold similar views who would actually be useful contributors to the game and it's development.i urge everyone to not vote for the op."
1/23/2015,"wrong. a planned attack can heavily involve covert ops ships, but it is not nearly as possible to respond to a covert ops attack with covert ops ships because the defenders did not have enough warning time to suspect a covert ops attack.my problem with the current cloaking mechanic is not that it hurts some people more than others (it doesn't) but that it stagnates pvp in general and leads to fewer kills due to increased danger, due to decreased intel."
1/23/2015,"your campaign post is really short and limited, being someone who did csm interviews for csm9 i've been able to get a better perspective on the process and the internal workings in the csm and i just have to disagree with a lot of what you say.secondly, i know your name from somewhere but i just can't remember from what.it would be very nice to write up a bit of background information about yourself, what you do in eve online, are you active in the meta game, what is your current ingame activity... just basic information...i am not voting for someone who is a blank person, i would like to know a bit more about you."
1/23/2015,i wonder how many players have no idea what the csm stands for and who never voted before. any good suggestions how to get in touch with them and make them care ? would be nice if we could use the in game billboards for this.
1/23/2015,"when i first heard that bam was running - thanks to his presence on twitter - i was very surprised, then i pretty much forgot about it and got on with my vacation.however, now i have been back a few days i have had plenty of time to read and review his platform i can firmly say that i endorse bam. as a social player and one of the front guys of several in-game communities it would be wrong not too.having met bam and heard his love for the community, and seen all that he does on your behalf, i find myself sold even more. with a true community representative such as bam on the csm, the future of eve will be bright indeed."
1/23/2015,"my only complaint was that evemeet.com wasn't up in time for our mn meet up to use....when it comes to community, i don't think anyone can argue that bam isn't in one of the top representative positions for the eve community and to the eve community.+1 sir!host of high drag podcast."
1/23/2015,"first as has been stated thats a year old, but i can happily answer the questions. yes its to mean we still have to rely on other areas of space. having said that there is now ice in the shattered wormholes (you cant mine the ice in the small ones mind)i'm all for any extra content in w space, not just harder. to run c6 sites without the cap escalation some t3 and guardains or rr tengus, with cap escalation 2 carriers 2 dreads and some webbers.i'd be happy with more effects, anything that adds interest is good, not really sure what tbh, i'd love more people in w space, so yeah at the moment i feel its low and hope that it will increase.you can get market data now from crest. which is really up to date. i dont have any concern with it.the next bit is a interesting idea if you want to expand on it feel free to mail anything to me.pos gunning could use a total overhaul to make it much more interesting its horrid to do at the moment. pos guns could also probably use a look at as well since most ships have been buffed but pos stuff hasnt."
1/23/2015,"what do you think of the idea of buffing pos gun damage while making them automatically spread fire out to different targets--giving the defensive advantage to a medium+ fleet even before logi--and allowing crewed pos guns to be focused on individual targets, allowing easy blapping of softer subcaps or significant assistance to blap even the tough ones when coordinating with a defense fleet?"
1/23/2015,oops!forget to post a link to corbexx's cap stable interview.i'll just leave this here:
1/23/2015,"1) i agree with prelocking the wasd. 2) i am trying to see who to talk to about making a semi official library of overviews (with commentary) funny thing, most players protect their overviews like it was the recipe for coke (cola) i personally use a modified sarashawa.3) this i cannot comment upon (which should tell you something)mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
1/23/2015,"i have captain's quarters turned off, as i sacrifice the game looking pretty for the game running as smoothly as possible. (i also operate on the absolute minimum graphics settings despite having a middle of the range computer). so i'd never notice them there and am not qualified to answer if that would be a useful place. billboards i would endorse a channel advertisement system, either one where channels opt-in or opt-out, as long as it was not mandatory for all channels to be there. but i do so with one important caveat.it is important to recognise that experienced players can both train and mistrain rookies. it is necessary to convey to new players that they *can* matter in pvp before they have ten million sp, and i'm concerned that rookies might gravitate toward mining or missioning channels where they would receive actively bad advice. i did, after all, begin eve believing that i needed to both field a lot of isk and have a lot of sp to pvp at all, and this is the prevailing wisdom amongst many carebears."
1/23/2015,"thats some really bold statements to make on annecdotal evidence. all the people i have spoken to seem to say the opposite that c1 to c4 are doing really well. i wonder who's right ;) you can find alot of the info in the wormhole winter summit minutes.by not having any major changes, you mean things like a huge increase in pay outs for c1 to c4, the fact relic and data sites from k space have been added.you do also realise that finding specific c6 wh's are also by far the easiest wormholes to find? i'd hardly call them insulated.first its not awoxing, you mean corp on corp and if people want immunity they can do it right now just by being in a npc corp. if this was as much of a issue as you say people would have been leaving w space ages ago to run incursions in npc corps. so your arguement really falls down here."
1/23/2015,cap stable interview
1/23/2015,"this is arguable. it's only interesting to you because of conflict. some players are quite happy without it. there are all types in this game and everyone should get a say, not just your guys. there are numerous reasons not to play on the test server - no social interaction potential resets, more downtime. people pay to play this sandbox game in whatever way they see fit, and that's what they do. ccp support that. you supporting only conflict driven content makes you no better than someone supporting only non-conflict combat. if you can't understand that there should be a balance between the two, there's no talking to you."
1/23/2015,"i and many others agree with those changes. you don't like it because it takes away easy awoxing, but i'm more of the opinion that if newbies get recruited more and more into the game, when you and your ilk inevitably try to gank them, they'll stick with the game rather than leaving. you can whine all you want about how it should be done in other ways, but those other ways require players to change their ways, to actually teach newbies instead of just ganking and trolling them. well that's not going to happen. ccp can't patch players behaviours, so they patch what they can to steer it. perhaps you should have thought of the consequences of targeting people who are primarily newer. while you think you are a content creator, you're not really. you create content only for yourself, denying content for your targets. you do this under the impression that ccp value what you do more. well wake up, ccp are running a business and they will act in whatever way they see fit to ensure the health of that buesiness. if that means changing direction a bit to accommodate more players, that's where they will go.i doubt highsec will ever be completely safe, but highsec is a place where pvp is done in a different way. a lot of pvp doesn't take place with turrets.null bears generally have no issues with the worst offenders in their alliances being taught by someone else. the only thing they have issue with is when it's alluded to that it's elite combat. the primary issue i have with wardeccers is the sheer number of wardecs able to be performed. it was all designed so you have a grudge with someone, there's a way to be able to fight with them. what it's used for instead is to farm kills, with smaller independent corps being the ones that suffer the most from it.even if they do get on, they'll quickly realise that their opinions won't suddenly hold more power. when ccp want to do something to aid player retention, no kicking or screaming about the ""spirit of eve"" will make them jeopardise their company. they certainly aren't going to get listened to if their primary decision is based on ""extra conflict = automatically good, less conflict = automatically bad""."
1/23/2015,"if i buy call of duty, and then go on their forums and complain that other people are allowed to shoot me, i would probably be banned for trolling, and rightfully so.eve online is no less a pvp game. whether you partake of that or not, you should still recognize and accept it. if your say consists of ""what other people like about the game should be deleted!"", then no you really shouldn't.see the call of duty example above. you don't get to have a say when it comprises complete opposition to the spirit of the game. if you hate it that much, why are you playing it in the first place?read the faq. it says, in no uncertain terms ""eve online is a pvp game"". if you can't understand that, then you can't be redeemed as a player."
1/23/2015,"i pref the market to be floaded and to pay ccp 20$ and they would give me 1.5 billion isk so i can get some cheap stuff to lose since i have no time to grind, then to buy a plex and sell it on the market to greedy isk people who play 24/7 and only think of themselfs. everything expensive to fly even a firgate makes playing eve for those who cant play 24/7 unplayable. it's not verry fun to pay sub and need to buy plex to sell for 800million wich makes playing eve and have some fun cost 40$, to lose expensive t1 frigs, cruisers and modules to feed isk whores pockets again. everything cheap in eve would make losing ships in low sec fights more fun"
1/23/2015,"i don't get where these people claiming that ccp are changing awoxing to protect newbies.i do not advocate this, but if you wanted to make a change to pvp to protect newbies, you would prevent lowsec gatecamping. that is where newbies lose ships to mistakes all the time, particularly in lowsec systems that sell skillbooks. removing awoxing is nothing but a change to protect career highsec players and to reward recklessness. competently led corporations were seldom infiltrated, and if a disloyal member got in, they seldom did damage with blue on blue highsec attacks - the disloyal member might land tackle, but other loyal members would arrive on grid before anyone was killed."
1/23/2015,"eve online is a sandbox virtual world. the appeal is that you can do what you want. sure, all actions affect other players and in that sense it's pvp, but that doesn't mean that every change *must* generate conflict.it's a balance. you want to have more conflict, which takes away their ability to play while being relatively safe. they want to play in safety while you are unable to shoot them. ccp finds a balance between the two. what's funny is that your quote of ""what other people like about the game should be deleted!"" is exactly the same from the other side. there are plenty of people that want more conflict in high sec by removing opportunities to play pve safely, or want changes like 0.5s to be concord-free or level 4 missions to only appear in lowsec.referring to the call of duty strawman again doesn't make it any more relevant. call of duty's primary gameplay is based around guns and shooting. removing that would be like removing spaceships from eve which is what eve is built around. shooting people is just a part of the game, just like pve is. to make you analogy more correct, changes to one or the other are like changes to team based mechanics like ctf or deathmatch mechanics, both of which are valid styles of play in cod.and yes, i get to have a say. i also play this game, and have don for a long time. what you think is not automatically correct. until the day that ccp decides to delete pve from the game, it will remain a completely valid playstyle, and should also receive as much attention as any other part. if improving that gameplay upset yours and ccp still decide to go ahead, then tough luck buddy. that's what happens when you play a game with more than one playstyle being catered to. if you don't like it you have as much right to quit as anyone else.pvp as in what you do affects other players, not as in ""the game is only about shooting other people"". eve is a lot more complex that that, hence my claim that ideas should be judged on their individual merits and not automatically accepted and rejected based on how much conflict they create. and until you run ccp, you have no say in whether or not i'm ""redeemed as a player""."
1/23/2015,"it's not to ""protect"" newbies in that way. it's not to stop newbies being shot. it's to encourage people to recruit newbies by removing one of the major risks with recruiting newbies. if a newbie can't be a corp attacker (i use this term as awoxing covers other activities still allowed), it means there's no problem in giving a newbie a chance in a corp. career highsec players already have protection. they can be in npc corps or in corps of just their alts which protect them as much as this change does. a lot of people are simply blowing this change way out of proportion so they can make their objections sound more grand."
1/23/2015,"after listening to the interview on capstable i have a few questions1. you stated there that you would like to see industry/highsec corps fight back against organisations such as your own - how would you say the effects of ""highsec warfare"" (neutral scouts, logistics and the like) influences this ability? i have been in mercenary high sec corps before and what we were hearing from our targets was mostly ""we can't fight you anyway, as you'll have a horde of neutral chars backing you up"" - any ideas on that problem?2. you are very actively talking about ""the end of awoxing"" and the likes....do you have any ideas of how big the contribution of highsec in-corp kills has been? any numbers on that? because the way you talk about this change, one gets the impression this is a huge topicfollow up on this - how is your oppinion on the thesis that more intra-corp conflicts will make more people stay in npc or single-player cops?3. during your interview i kind of felt that you were promoting a point of ""play the game the way i enjoy to play it in highsec or don't play it"" - any comments on that?as someone who runs highsec activities to participate in the markets and industry, but lives in wspace, i'm curious to why i should be considered a ""risk averse carebear"" while on my highsec characters4. regarding freighter ganking - is it ok from your point of view that you currently can not even fill a freighter with max cargo fitting with tritanium without beeing a somewhat worthy gank target? (700m cargo with trit, about twice that much on pyerite) what is in your oppinion the job of ships like freighters, if you can't even move cheap, basic materials with them, without bringing a webber along5. regarding wspace i can only agree with corbexx - please get some data before you make bold assumptions and statements on ""annecdotal evidence"""
1/23/2015,"eve's biggest strength is the depth of player interaction. that is undeniable. changes don't have to generate conflict. but changes that take away from conflict by definition take away player interaction.that is not a good thing.except that i am not advocating that missions be deleted. i don't want their playstyle to go away entirely.they do want the elimination of mine, that has been made clear many, many times over the years. there's a good indicator of that going on right now in fact, with awoxing being deleted.don't try to pretend like there is any moral equivalency between the two sides, because there is not. and if i go there, and hatefully demand that my ""playstyle"" involves walking around in that game being immune to bullets, people will laugh at me.that's exactly what we have here. when you have someone demanding something entirely contrary to the reality of the game.why that is even being entertained, i cannot imagine.and if you haven't figured it out yet, i am not talking about ""pve"", which although i truly despise it, has a place in this game. i am talking about the kind of people who insist that they should be immune to the actions of other people. the people who want to pretend like an mmo is a single player game.the last thing this game needs is more safety. it has too much already, that's why everything is so inflated compared to a few years ago."
1/23/2015,"that *entirely* depends on the change, and that's my point. a blanket statement of ""that is obviously bad because it reduces conflict"" isn't a good way to look at ideas. a csm member should be able to look at the individual merits of an idea and not rules them out based on such a simplistic view.and most don't want ganking to go away entirely either sure, some people do, but some people also want concord completely gone too. if you're only going to take the most extreme opinions you have to do the same for both sides. if you want to look at it realistically, some people want more safety, some people want less, that's all. neither is categorically right or wrong, and balance needs to be found.and awoxing isn't being ""deleted"". corp aggression - the easiest form or an awox - is being removed to give highsec corps more freedom to recruit newbies. it's not the end of the world, so stop trying to play it up like it is. sure, it's negative to your playstyle, but then change always are negative to someone. when they released the refining changes, a whole category of pve players was nerfed and they got over it, so just htfu and get on with it.except that's not a valid playstyle in cod while it is in eve. you can avoid being killed. hell, my traders have a 0% chance of being killed, since they never leave stations and they make orders of magnitude more isk than other forms of pve.that's not what we have here. what we have here is someone of the opinion that any change that reduces conflict is automatically bad. you're the one then dragging that into being against an argument that isn't being put forward. it's a common thing for you these days. anytime anyone says anything that suggests a that pve players deserve some effort from ccp is instantly met with you arguing against the idea that pvp should be removed. that argument is in your head.my statement was incredibly simple: any idea, regardless of whether it increase or decreased conflict should be looked at for it's own merits. any csm candidate who will automatically disregard ideas because they reduce conflict without giving them a second look is not a good candidate."
1/23/2015,that's the whole point. there is no merit to ideas that reduce player interaction. none. they should be dismissed out of hand.
1/23/2015,"you sir are incorrect. there is more to eve than the specific way you play it, and to improve some styles of play requires some changes which reduce interaction in one way or another. you obviously can't look objectively at these things, so good day to you."
1/23/2015,"well - kaarous in what category would the jump fatigue changes fall?more interaction because of less risk involved to get hotdropped, thereby promoting more small/medscale fights?less interaction because of slower movement there reducing the number of players at battles?you can't put every change into a category like increases or decreases interaction - it doesn't work that way"
1/23/2015,"if you read what i mentioned above, it is possible for a change to be a net neutral. i firmly believe that the jump range changes were such, but promoted a greater increase in small scale conflicts, particularly subcapital fights, than it did to discourage capital fights.so i'd say it ended up as a net positive for wider spread conflict. but that was just one of those ""we'll have to wait and see"" kinds of things. a change that on it's outset clearly detracts from potential player interaction is a different matter entirely."
1/23/2015,"then they shouldn't be improved in that way. there are plenty of ways to improve this game's pve without crippling player interaction.personally, i think they were on the right track with burner rats, and that more missions should involve elite enemies instead of blowing away wave after wave of zerging rats.you're trying to claim that the only way pve can be improved is at my expense, and that just exposes it for what it really is.it's not about improving your gameplay, and it never was. it's about hurting mine. and that's why people like sabriz need to be elected. because ccp needs to hear my voice, and the voice of people who care about pvp and the sandbox all over eve."
1/23/2015,"again, you seem to have no concept of a minor change. a change to improve pve which is detrimental to interaction is not necessarily going to *cripple* player interaction. you have a very extreme view of changes against player interaction but not so the other way.no, i'm claiming that some ways will affect your gameplay. all changes will affect someone negatively, no matter what that change is. you have no problem with other people's gameplay getting affected by positive changes to yours, but when the shoe is on the other foot you scream blue murder.it's got absolutely nothing to do with hurting your gameplay. everyone's opinions need to be listened to, not just your select group of players. your happy to go on about how the carebears shouldn't have a say, yet you act the exact same way from the opposite side of the fence and your opinion is supposed t be listened to instead?you are not better or more important than any other player, and other people's opinions are valid too. a csm representative should represent the needs of the community as a whole, not just one subset of players. sabriz complained that tora's campaign is geared around benefiting himself and his friends, and that's exactly the same if sabriz agrees to automatically reject any idea which decreases conflict without consideration. and lets face it, if a csm member becomes known for rejecting ideas without consideration they are less likely to be the ones listened to when ccp makes a decision. sabriz would serve his players better by taking on board the ideas put forward and giving solid reasons why they should not be implemented, rather than rejecting them out of hand, but then again players from your camp never have been very good at reasoning, just exploding into ""zomg you want total safety! i'm paying it forward! waah, waah why u nerf me ccp"" every time a minor change is suggested."
1/23/2015,"you seem to have a very limited view of ""player interaction"". i would think that corporations not being as at risk from a newbie recruit might well increase player interaction by reducing the level of trust required for players to cooperate."
1/23/2015,"deletion of an entire playstyle is not a minor change, so knock off the lies and obfuscation. if ccp proposed tomorrow that missions be deleted, i would be right up there with the mission runners demanding it be overturned. because whether i like something or not (and i despise eve's pve ""content"" with all my heart), does not merit it's deletion.your side on the other hand is not capable of being impartial or fair. you just want pvp deleted as often and as thoroughly as possible."
1/23/2015,why do you keep avoiding him. shouldn't a csm listen to everyone and not just the players who agree with you? don't you think its arrogant to tell people not to post any more on the public eve-o forum ?
1/23/2015,"forum rules prevent me from answering this question fully.in short, seraph is neither interested in a productive discussion about the csm nor in my platform as a whole. we have a history together that dates back over two years to when we were in the same corp together, him as the ceo and myself as the director. we did not part amicably - that much i'm sure is obvious. i engaged with him during my csm9 campaign, but the aftermath of that nonsense proved to me that simply ignoring him is the best course of action.i'm all for discussions about the game, debating conflicting ideas, and defending both my position and opinions.... but i'm not going to humor someone who harbors nothing but malicious intent towards me."
1/23/2015,would you say that's something common with you? i can't say that sugar kyle or fuzzy steve have people that have such feelings towards them. it wouldn't be a good quality in a csm to cause such feelings from the player body. at the end of the day we all know this is a game but if you're the type of person that elicits that response from people it would be detrimental(to all of us) to have you presenting our problems to ccp.
1/23/2015,"i apologize in advance for using argument ad absurdum, but by this logic any cfc candidate - even the mittani himself - would have been a detriment to the csm since they have enemies. in a game of conflict, it's impossible to constantly fight and compete with others without making enemies, let alone having everyone still like you.as for people like fuzzy, mike, et al, they do not engage in adversarial play styles so the comparison is moot.there are many candidates who can present your problems to ccp, and in your specific case sugar is probably the best one for the job. that being said, the people who i compete against, or who am hostile with, would never find themselves without a voice on the csm due to my inclusion on the council. i would never purposefully oppose change or try to silence those who i dislike, simply because i dislike them or because in game they are my enemy. this is no different than cfc candidates advocating for the health of the game as a whole rather than the health of their specific coalition."
1/23/2015,"i have removed a rule breaking post.also, as i have stated earlier please refrain from stating the same (counter) arguments or personal opinions over and over again.this is a csm campaign thread, please keep it civil!the rules:2. be respectful toward others at all times. the purpose of the eve online forums is to provide a platform for exchange of ideas, and a venue for the discussion of eve online. occasionally there will be conflicts that arise when people voice opinions. forum users are expected to be courteous when disagreeing with others. 4. personal attacks are prohibited. commonly known as flaming, personal attacks are posts that are designed to personally berate or insult another forum user. posts of this nature are not beneficial to the community spirit that ccp promote and as such they will not be tolerated.13. spamming is prohibited. spam is defined as the repetitive posting of the same topic or nonsensical post that has no substance and is often designed to annoy other forum users. this can include the words <U+FFFD>first<U+FFFD>, <U+FFFD>go back to (insert other game name)<U+FFFD> and other such posts that contribute no value to forum discussion. spamming also includes the posting of ascii art within a forum post. isd ezwal community communication liaisons (ccls)"

1/23/2015,i endorse pantsufan on the grounds that csm minutes are boring and could use some livening up akin to his delightful and entertaining mails posted to eveskunk. they really do brighten up my day.
1/23/2015,"greetingsim joshee, lbf`s ceo and a skeleton crew alliance member.first i would like to clarify that i have never been requested or re numerated in any way by pantsu or anyone else to endorse pantsufan`s desire to become a member of csm.also i would like to say that im not talking on the behalf of my corporation, they can make their choice unaided.my corp joined skeleton crew on sept 20th 2014, and never regretted it :) i will be placing my "" in favor"" vote for pantsufan.i think he has tons of experience to actually highlight some needed changes to eve. nobody's perfect and the more varied your history the more u can input, and we all make mistakes the key is to learn on it and improve. and i believe strongly pantsu does it well.also im having lots of fun in this alliance :) and eve should be fun!regardsjosheelbf ceoskeleton crew alliance"

1/24/2015,"sadly too many people blame incarna, rather than ccps management."
1/24/2015,10
1/24/2015,"exactly, even outside of roleplay, i will bring up the swg situation every time until it sticks.swg had cantinas, usually big buildings that made it a pain in the butt to get around town because youd have to go around them, they served no practical purpose in 90%+ of circumstances, however they were regularly filled with a couple hundred people, why?because even if it serves no ""gameplay"" purpose, people like to socialize, sitting down next to someone in a bar is a classic awkward way to force interaction/discussion, people like face2face time, putting an avatar they can actually see to the voice they hear or the text they see, wis to start with doesnt have to have some amazing ""oh my god"" feature right off the bat, it can and should start simply as a way for players to physically associate, mingle, etc."
1/24/2015,"it isnt just a game about ""blowing up spaceships"", its a game about space, yes, with ships, yes, conflict, yes. but only about 10% of the game is actual fighting, the other 90% of that game is all the different functions and events that enable that pvp, the people meeting and forming friendships, rivalries, the spys, saboteurs, and usurpers collapsing empires or emptying wallets, the little groups uniting against common enemies.if eve is about anything, is social interaction and politics, because these are the reasons we have pvp, if we didnt have these, the only pvp that would be in the game is the occasional lowsec gank and not much else, and if you think thats all that matters then i assume youd be fine if they just removed the entire game and replaced it with matchmaking.incarna has a purpose, to enable more personal social interaction, as well as a little bit of scenery for people to hang out and leave running on their computer while they do other stuff. social interaction is just as valid a reason to play eve as mindless pvp, so theres nothing wrong with catering to that crowd.[also lol at ""second life"", which was neither the first, most recent, or most significant game to have avatars, most games do nowadays, weird huh?]"
1/24/2015,"there's something fundamentally wrong with analyzing the current player base and i think, basically, we're not a valid or ideal data group. we've proved that we're accepting of bad gameplay. my opinion is that eve seems to filter most players it encounters, down to those of us who continue to play for reasons other than fun. for me, i was introduced to eve just prior to joining the army and entering flight school... so it was my plan to continue training, but not experience gameplay for what ended up being 3 years. other players will stay for irl friendships and other reasons that aren't related to the conventional goal of ""fun."" so studying us for some insight into what might make eve wildly popular is very off-course.if you continue catering to players like me, it's pretty much a waste of effort. i think all those players who leave are far more valuable for studying their behavior, with the goal of making eve wildly popular.another reason i am not a good candidate for study is because i am a tinkerer, and i like projects, and taking apart broken electronics to see how they work, and then put them back together. i'm not here because i'm having fun, i'm here because i am obsessed with problems and i want to figure out what is wrong with this broken thing ( eve ).there are some basic, conventional expectations that eve does not meet, and i think they're crucial to the type of recreational experience people expect from a video game. one of them is a gradual ramp-up in training times, and the other one is range of performance in ships.i think people are accepting of the idea that an item in a video game has a range of performance and can be improved overtime. two of the worst disconnects between game structure and player expectations of improvement over time are role bonuses and level v requirements of base hull skills of t2 ships. role bonuses are a ""poof magic"" effect that is granted as soon as the item is obtained. this presents a few problems, starting with betraying the player's expectation of gradual improvement with skills ( a concept we can all accept ). ""poof magic"" also a big part of the reason for the outcry when i suggest making t2 ships more accessible to players at lower skill levels. when such a big portion of a ship's capability exists automagically, perhaps the naysayers are correct for disagreeing with my proposals of rearranging skill requirements. linear progression should appease the naysayers, i would imagine. t2 ships are not linear enough in their improvement, in their current form.t2 ships also receive a set of bonuses based on the base hull skill, which is required at level v at the same time. in effect, this results in an additional ""poof magic"" set of bonuses that are applied at full-strength upon obtaining the item. again, this is a betrayal of a player's expectation that there will be gradual improvement of an item over time. it also contributes to the apprehensiveness of players who attempt to imagine a linear proliferation of t2 ships.base hull skill requirements at level v and role bonuses are huge failures in providing linear gameplay.there is a long-held convention in eve that ""specialization"" means that skills should be required up-front. i agree that ""specialization"" refers to the range of performance in an item, and that it should involve several levels of focused skill training. however, the requirement of level v skills is not justified, in my opinion.compared to allowing players to obtain t2 ships and improve them gradually, i struggle to find reasons why they should have their current arrangement. base ship skills at level v presents a time wall, and a subscription barrier that makes sense from a profit standpoint, but it holds gameplay hostage for financial gain. the other possibility that disturbs me is that someone holds the basic sentiment that ""specialization"" should be uncomfortable and painful, because eve is hardcore. the bad news is, this form of hardcore is not fun, and it drives people away who expect a logical, satisfying gaming experience.it's impossible to know for sure, because the reasons for the current convention of ""specialization"" are basically ""because specialization.""ideally, i think, t2 ship progression should allow all level v skills to be grouped at the end of the skill queue, with base hull bonuses available to fly at level i, and role bonuses being unlocked in a linear manner, such as on a per-mastery level basis. this way, the end-goal of a fully-skilled, perfect, specialized ship is possible, with a wider range of performance, and linear progression for players."
1/24/2015,"awsome to see you guys like the quick minutes, makr sure u give everyone at ccp involved a big cheer, and some of us that type proper english edit them until really late to ensure u all get them quick and right.from mu point of view too see a ccp this engaged, moving forward with putting players first and encorporating players and players actions into areas that are traditionally theirs, is amazing. too see ccp take control of their and our game in a year, and turn the release cadence into something you all love is even more wooopie doopie. we have been welcomed, talked too, presented, listened, feedbackerdedefd, and explained so many things. some guy tweeted ccp has to many white collars. i can tell you, i havent seen one. well tbh on sions shirt one day. bit tired, but thnx all involved, wow"

1/24/2015,"curious;* dose ccp see's any issue's with people fly smart bombing machariel's to kill npc rats in anoms as something of a issue ?*why wasn't there any discussion about the progress of the dogma code re-write & its larger implications for completion of the ship tiercide project. there has been a number of times it has been given as the reason as to why capitals, super's & titan's cant be rebalanced yet. not to mention its been used as justification as to delays in ccp's ability to do work on pos's and other things.would of thought this would of been a high priority.* when will we be able to change rigs on ships without them having to be destroyed ? that would be a significant change that would open up allot of options for use of ships, across the board.* instead of looking to nerf tengu's, why not fix the other t3's so they are on par with the tengu ? answer is, it isn't the ship it's self, that's the issue, its the medium sized weapons platforms, their range and fall off's. the weapons on the others can't do what you can do with a tengu in fleet's. so fix that, instead of just nerfing a single t3 because people take advantage of what it can be done with it.* if ccp revisited cyno's and made the skill requirements lower for covert cyno's and allowed it to be fitted to more ships, you would see an increase in the use of ships that can use them to jump. but at the sametime you have to address the fatigue issue around using covert cyno jumps as well. jumping to covert cyno's should not incur as much fatigue as jumping to a normal cyno.* battleships - these ships have been almost outclassed by cruisers to a point whereby they arent used anywhere near what they were go back 4yrs ago. are there any plans on revisiting them so they don't get get consigned to the waste bin ? localizationi'd really like to know, if ccp would look at making buying plex, available in more currencies other than usd or gbp?currency conversion rates, hurt allot of people and are a barrier for many people that pay for their game time, with rl money rather than in game isk. for example personally, i resent paying up to $10.00 more than the usd$19.95 + transaction fees on top to buy a single plex. besides buying plex , buying other eve merchandise is also an issue for people with currency conversion rates, which often makes it too expensive and out of reach for people's affordability. sovereignty & nullsec show us the statistic's please.also show us stat's showing a comparison of wormhole travel usage before and after the changes.also, will ccp look at introducing something more than the risk vs reward system, that would encourage more players to move from high sec in to low & nul sec ?something else, that hasn't been mentioned, is the availability or drop rate of certain faction/ navy types ammo & dead space items has stopped and disappeared from the markets. generic faction ammo can be purchased via loyalty points, but things like dg ,ts db ammo types cant be. again there is a range of dead space items that in the last 12 months, have become unavailable. are they being removed from the game or has something broken?lastly, and it hasn't been covered anywhere so far in the summit, would ccp look at rotating downtime, so that a single time zone is not solely affected ?"
1/24/2015,"generally speaking, i suspect the time to bring up a stack of fresh questions is not after the 3rd day of 4, or during the csm summit at all.(but areen, didn't you ask about the impersonation clause after day 1? er, yes. sorry.)but to this one, i can't speak for ccp, but i suspect it is not a coincidence that downtime is during the icelandic working day (with the whole afternoon left to respond to any immediate crises) and as such it seems unlikely it would be at a radically different time..."
1/24/2015,"the problem here, is that the community isn't advise of what the agenda for the summit is in advance, so we can only respond as the minutes are released and the topics are shown. if we knew the agenda in advance, we could send evemails to the csm representatives beforehand and ask them to speak for us, on points of our concern & to ask our questions, rather than relying on them being guided solely by their own experiences."

1/24/2015,"on the issue of battleships, one thing that stands out to me is the marauder ability of functioning as a miniature dread with bastion mode. it isn't a complete redefinition of battleships, but i consider the addition of bastion mode a significant gesture toward making battleships more interesting.i think the answer lies in raising the dps ceiling of battleships and battlecruisers by 50%, mostly due to their signature radius being disproportionately big compared to their current dps figures, as well as every other factor of their classes. the basic idea is bringing battleships and battlecruisers closer to bridging the gap between subcapitals and dreads.o7 to the csms for your service."

1/24/2015,good job all. thanks for the effort and top marks on the minutes.
1/24/2015,"balancing meeting was the one of most interest too me.. i wonder if there was more said in detail and more ships discussed?some things i would like too see addressed are- t3 ships having t2 resists removed.. it should be the domain of t2 ships only having inbuilt t2 resists.. a hull advantage..- removing rigs is the favoured option for sure on t3's (less expense, also less hp trimarks/extenders good thing)- i would like a stronger discussion on subs and t3 hulls, they are hugely expensive now and any nerfs would need price reductions here, for sub switching too happen they need too be cheap too even consider buying stacks of the different subs either for in station changes or for putting in cargo for switching during fleet roams/ moving too hunt a target.-remove sp loss .. its a pointless punitive mechanic- build in fitting/hp etc into the hull so swapping subs is easier too do. slots being removed and the mods stripped every time you change a sub is unnecessary time wasting, and it would be easier for comparisons being able too look at the ships attributes, rather than the 10's of subs there are.on combat bc's - i would like the current abc's talos etc moved to a t2 hull as they are specialist ships using oversized guns- this would allow some of the current cbc's moved into the attack section thus allowing more mobility on those that need iton capitals- removing logi bonuses/ links from basic carriers would allow supers too have that as their domain instead giving them a use- add supercarrier skillbook too further separate them from carriers- also remove sentries/ heavies from carriers-remove drone/fighter assist"
1/24/2015,"i would suggest the dps ceiling needs to be put on cruisers.. the dps of things like gilas/vni's/ishtars and a few others are what makes bc's and battleships less useful.. aswell as bc's excessive sig radius.. and fitting needs a bit of a raise on bc's aswell as making t1 links more accessible too younger players in these ships..a combination of overbuffing cruisers and overnerfing bc's and some battleships being left neglected, plus warp speed changes"
1/24/2015,ishtars need to achieve at least 50% of all pvp damage to get touched upon?
1/24/2015,on day 4;has either ccp and/or csm talked about promoting voting for csm xor did that not make the minutes or is nda-ed ?
1/24/2015,"it is no fun being targeted by a huge alliance of many corps combined if you are a small corp of only several members. it takes all the fun out of the game if you are primarily industrialists, miners and mission runners against those that are pvp'rs first and foremost. i always thought low sec was the place for such as these, so they could pummel each other into pieces to their hearts content. there is nothing wrong with hi sec being a theme park. those that are there are happy with it. they do not like being repeatedly ganked and war deced. low is the place for that ...it needs fixing."
1/24/2015,"eve is a competitive sandbox game, not a mining simulator or space-themed version of farmville. your industrial operation affects the rest of us, so why should you be isolated from the actions of your competitors?if you don't want to compete with the other corporations then just stay in an npc corp and you are immune to wardecs. it's not ideal, and ccp is working on a social system for you, but for now make a chat channel for the people you want to mine, mission or build stuff with and you are 100% immune from wardecs. you thought wrong. highsec is not, nor ever has been a risk-free place to do industry. highsec has some unique mechanisms to control the types of engagements, but it has always been intended as a place where players and corporations can compete with each other, both directly through ship pvp, and indirectly through the multitude of competitive actions that all players engage in everyday. there is much ""wrong"" with a highsec theme park. it would break a great many things and even further draw players away from the other spaces. highsec will always be a place of sucide ganks and wardecs - these are things that have been put into highsec on purpose by ccp for good reason. sure, wardecs have some problems and could be made better but they have always been a part of the design of highsec. this is a pvp game. you can do only industry or pve and never ship combat but you better make arrangements for your own defense with pvpers. you cannot extract the benefits of living in a competitive world while expecting to be immune from the touch of others you are competing with."
1/24/2015,"i love that my detractors are from code. and marmite, it tells me i am on the right course. a few tactics i have seen recently with afk cloakers:- every system camped- two cloakers, one sneaks up and tackles, the other cynos at range, they hit, score and mjd away. counter drop lands on nothing- afk cloaker sits around for ages, people decide to fly some cheap stuff to make some isk, a loan saber rushes up the systems (or logs on), warps to the cloaker at range which lands him on the targets and tackles a few ratters working together or a mining fleet. then the cyno goes up at range for an mjd escape.t3s under most situations can't be killed before the blop gets in. as far as i know there is also no way to jam a covert cyno with say a scrambler or neuting the cyno ship."

1/24/2015,"just listened to your cap stable interview and i found it very thought provoking and interesting. that said i don't really agree on much you say - i want high sec abolished apart from a few nursery systems for new players and anything else is just a waste of dev time imo. high sec doesn't make sense (at least to most players i've talked to) yet most eve players chose to live there even with the best and more rewarding content elsewhere. why? the answer is quite simple isn't it? ""you can't trust anyone in eve, but you can trust npc's to protect you in high sec,"" which for me is a rather terrible situation for eve to be in.i've just taken a year or so break from eve, and i made a new character to see whether i wanted to come back or not, and managed to watch enough predatory high sec players doing their thing with my new character that i came to the following conclusion: the longer that gankers/griefers operate with impunity and complete safety in high sec (buzzing around in their pods) the more ccp will be pushed to act by those on the receiving end of the gank. i personally don't think buffing things for 'carebears' or continuing to allow the gankers to operate as they do now as good for the game in the long term. i know a lot of players who have gone full turtle after a high sec wardec (including myself) and i know lots of people who quit altogether, but i don't blame gankers of high sec wardeccers for eve's problems, i blame high sec mechanics.so, because i see high sec as the cancer slowly killing off eve subscribers and i want the vast majority of high sec to be abolished i obviously won't be voting for you as your manifesto stands. however i would really appreciate it if you could answer a question - do you think that the likes of yourself, marmite and code would adapt and find enjoyable content in eve if high sec was downgraded to low or null sec? i know this may seem like a strange question, but i honestly think that high sec's days are numbered.*this character is currently my main and in an npc corp because i've not decided on the area he is going to operate in yet (and there will be a lot of lossmails on my way there i expect since i'm rusty.)"
1/24/2015,"then you need to stop acting like people are upset about ""a minor change"". it's dismissive and dishonest.i expect ccp to take my statements equally as seriously as those on the opposing side. the problem is that they're only listening to one side of the argument, and it damn sure isn't my side.which is precisely why people like sabriz must be elected to the csm."
1/24/2015,"except you are. at this point you are upset at the idea of giving ideas that reduce conflict a reasonable look before rejecting them, so you're in fact upset at non-existent changes. you repeatedly harp on about the removal of your playstyle to people who have not stated that's what they want. if you have a problem with other people's ideas, tell them, don't tell me when were talking about something different.even with sabriz on your side, if you repeatedly screech about every single tiny change as if it's the end of the world, you won't be taken seriously, and if sabriz repeatedly raises it, he also won't be taken seriously. as it is his entire campaign seems to be based around forcing other people to generate content for code regardless of their playstyle, so even if he gets in i doubt he'll be a major voice on the csm."
1/24/2015,"i think you are under a bit of a misapprehension about the reason for the change to intracorp aggression actually is. ccp has indicated that it is actually to increase interaction, and therefore conflict by getting more new players into highsec corporations where thy will compete with other corps for resources and market share, or directly using the wardec mechanics. ccp is not implementing this proposal to ""reduce conflict"". the problem i have with the changes are two-fold. first, it is unlikely to work as new players that actually want to already have no problem finding a corp, so this will not influence the player's behaviour but it will protect and stabilize poor corps and down-right exploitive corps and allow them to abuse newbies. there is no guarantee that this change will get newbies into actually good corps that will increase their chances of staying in the game. second, in order to try to get highsec corps to accept more new players, ccp is essentially bribing them with a flag to turn of a major risk to the established players in the corp. this is actually a significant reduction in risk to these players and will reduce conflict in the sandbox. ccp is betting that the net increase in player retention/interaction with highsec corps will offset this loss in content. i think they are wrong.so no, ideas that are designed to specifically reduce content should, and are usually are rejected out of hand by ccp. csm members also should reject any change to the sandbox that the primary outcome will reduce interaction or content - that is self-evident. the problem arises when ccp (and the csm) hopes that certain changes (like increasing the safety of highsec) will result in more player interaction or retention and when that doesn't materialize, such changes really just diminish conflict in the sandbox and the game is worse off than before. we need insistent voices on the csm to point out to ccp when they are in danger of doing this. first, being vocal about change that removes your previous playstyle (or perhaps more accurately in this case, strongly nerfs) should not be characterized as ""screeching"" - that is condescending to the concerns of a fellow player. these changes to intracorp aggression mechanics do exactly that to the niche group of players that participated in these corporate infiltration escapades. a fundamental part of their gameplay has/will be altered by these changes and they should be heard.dj funkybacon, a csm member, made an impassioned plea for the value of intracorp aggression during the summer csm meeting (starting on page 77). of course i can't know for sure, but i give him and his defense of intracorp agression much credit for the toning down of the proposal from the complete removal of intracorp aggression, to the optional flag we have now. so, your hypothesis that csm members that support a pro-conflict view of highsec will be ignored by ccp or the csm seems rather weak.in fact, ccp seagull has made it clear that her vision of eve is one where players are always in grand conflict with each other - everything will be destroyable she says. it was also made clear at last year's fanfest that players in social groups stay with the game much longer. therefore, development resources are not going to be spent on changes to the game that reduce conflict or interaction (or at least that will not be the intention). unless there is a major change in direction, there will be no significant new pve content - that ship has sailed. further, the importance of highsec will be minimized when the new player built stargates come online as a necessity to justify the current direction she is taking the game. representatives that get that eve is about conflict - candidates like sabriz - are exactly what is needed on the csm as we move forward into the new golden age of this game."

1/24/2015,cap stable interview:
1/24/2015,*snip* removed a reply to a deleted post. isd ezwal.edit - to stay on topic: jayne what are your thoughts on the new player experience in eve? what do you think can be improved upon and adjusted to better incentivize players into subscribing etc.?
1/24/2015,"just woke up hendrick, i'll respond to your questions after breakfast. seems there is a lot to catch up on. :p"
1/24/2015,"good interview with capstable. at least the first 3/4.i liked your npsi part and ........ totally disagree on the major of nerfing high-sec. why, because you do not think about both sides and focus purely on the carebears. high-sec has been ****** up enough the last few years. you're saying you want to remove all war decs from highsec. that's like me saying, i want to remove all npsi groups from eve, because they are shooting people who have done nothing to them. have you any idea how stupid that sounds ?metagaming +1 ps. you've got a new war"
1/24/2015,will you pay for my sec tags so i can fight you? or will you be coming to lowsec?

1/24/2015,"that's not representative of what i said in the interview. wars have their place in highsec, as i stated.edit: on the same note as koz, if you'd actually like to fight just let me know and i'd love to organize something. it'll have to be in lowsec tho, since the majority of us are pirates and can't even go to highsec in the first place.that is what wars are about, right? fights?"
1/24/2015,"i have another question about how you would handle a problem if it was harder or things turned badly. to give some back story when you were in overload everything, sash managed our syndicate moons. when things got tough instead of working with us, you turned tail, sold the moons to nocturnal romance and falsely blamed it on a rogue director. so instead of dealing with the problem, you took the easy way out. is this representative of how you would act as a csm rep? or was it all a con from the start, and it was the long game, with meticulous planning that? which while dirty (and eve related) might be a decent way to present it for your csm campaign. as having the ability to execute such a difficult plan is almost in line with seeing a plan from start to finish as a csm rep.so the tldr is; are you willing to see difficult problems from start to finish, working with those that are with you, or will you take the easy way out and find a scapegoat?"
1/24/2015,"and thats exactly my point. you are clueless when it comes to high-sec, but still want to destroy it. how about you stick with something you do know, like the npsi fleets. that part i did like about your interview, as it was based on facts, not feelings."
1/24/2015,"manny is a good man, i'll be voting for the first time this year.for those that dont know or have contact with him, he genuinely cares about the game as a whole and has the ability to look at the grander picture and see how each piece of the game interacts and affects the various ""end game"" routes that players strive to move towards.whether you are a casual player who mines or does missions after work, a part time pvper who enjoys fw and the occasional low sec roams or the more ""hardcore"" player who pvps daily, station trades into the 10s of billions or have a pi empire he'll consider how your enjoyment and contribution to the game will impact those on the opposite side of the map.as someone who has played this game since about a month after release in 03, i can honestly say ccp has delivered its best content, at a consistent rate over this past year moreso than any previous year without a doubt and i believe with people like manny he can help guide ccp to make sure the right areas are targeted to keep the game fun, healthy and in a state of growth."
1/24/2015,just completed an interview by the lowsec-focused site justforcrits!chance ravinne quizzedthanks to scaurus for this opportunity!
1/24/2015,"i think the legality of boosters needs to be revisited. there is no ""smuggler"" concept in the game, might be cool if there was, but it does not really exist. i think the diversity in boosters should be increased for combat, since there are only a handful currently. if boosters become more used , in turn, it becomes a bigger (more used) market. this could open up more profitable pathways for players interested in making these combat boosters (with the possibility of the legalities being revisited, easier to transport to potential markets as well).i would be very open to suggestions from people of what kind of boosters they would like to see and to which extent you can take the boosters (i.e. increased booster effectiveness at a higher level = higher risks of penalty to other ship functions like tracking, capacitor level, etc)i am open to hear any opinions on this, especially from those who use combat boosters frequently or would like to use them if circumstances were different."

1/25/2015,"hello readers of eve sand box! the jump fatigue is here to stay sorry! but on the flip side lets talk about the timers a bit more here....to start the carrier, supers jump fatigue is a bit high for the first jump....i would like to see the timer get nerf down to size a little bit here.. current time is 57 minutes...reduce down to 27 minutes....black ops and jump bridges....this adds good game content in the game for sub caps... not capital ships here....i think both should only be hit at 10% of the jump fatigue.... that's all for now enjoy!"
1/25/2015,"dear friends,no one is upset by the fatigue generated by small ships using jb's ?the home terrain advantage created by the jb in 0.0 space is now close to nothing due to fatigue. the whole point of the pheobe changes was to generate more fights but after a few months we can see that all the jump-changes killed the 0.0 warfare. this was a clear mistake, a lot of 0.0 members are against that but i did not see any mention about that at csm lvl. every time ccp is ""hitting with the nerf bat"" a ship or a ship class players find another ship or ship class to use for large pvp warfare and then the ccp will eventually nerf that ship or ship class. balance seems the word ccp does not understand when changing ships, interceptors with too much dps, some destroyers doing more dps than a cruiser, many cruisers doing more dps than all the t1 bc, battleships outgunned and undertanked ... we see less and less bs fleets except a few faction ones. the carrier was the capital ship helping a player to move his ships and assets and now is just a drone boat."
1/25/2015,"so, we're talking about ditching off-grid fighter assignment? you want to take the last useful thing about carriers away from them, too...is it a broken mechanic? definitely. how broken is easily illustrated by this kill ("
1/25/2015,"hey i remember this from 2011i fought the second-to-last boss in a coercer. i had to ask rookie help chat ""the prophecy is shooting a wavy red thing at me and my capacitor's gone, what's going on and how do i stop it?"" because of course i was completely out of cap, coercer crippled. i eventually killed it solo, after fitting my own vampire, but it took a long time. these days i guess the vamp effect'd appear near the capacitor readouti had to ask for help for the last boss, and helped out someone else sometime after i'd done it. i don't think it's a bad thing that the boss requires teamwork, but yeah making it clear that teamwork is desirable is a good movei still don't like that the tutorials and the quest lead newbies into mission running, because level ones/twos are tedious, have zero interaction with others and pay ridicuously poorly. i'm convinced this leads to poor retention. my first few months were spent being bored running the same bloody missions until i got a battleship"
1/25/2015,kinda curious as to where the **** that question came from and what would make someone even consider this o_o i dont think there has ever been an instance in the entire history of eve that an entire hull was removed from the game and i hope that this was never even considered by ccp.
1/25/2015,"i think xander's question comes from the fact, that these ships haven't been rebalanced as yet and there is no firm indication from ccp as to when they will be looked at.ccp has in the past said they want to and that they want to redefine the roles of carriers, super's as well as titans, from what they currently are. but that the dev's are prohibited from doing what they want to do, to rebalance & redefine them, due to the code re-write being incomplete. hence limiting what they can and can't do with them. so ccp wants to wait, until the code is finished and they can change these ships to new and different roles, from what they currently fill.on communication, and before fanfest happens this year; i wish that ccp would stop coming out at fanfest and telling us stuff they have no intention of following thru with.we have heard in the past about tessellation, ring moon mining ( just to name a few) & many, many more things, all of which seems to have been ditched. just give us the facts & tell us what your going to actually follow thru on, rather than pie in the sky idea's that sadly might never happen."
1/25/2015,"this dovetails into something that came to mind. instead of the active clone doing the learning, how about the clone in station be the one actually doing the learning? from a lore-ish point of view this appears to be more plausible - why tax a mind that is already dealing with an active day in the pod when the resting clone isn't getting anything done?? i was stuck on the cool down issue, but making it zero makes it all work."
1/25/2015,so a highly requested tweak is asked about but no one bothers to write it down? what else important had been dropped on the floor?
1/25/2015,mike is just looking to attend a red hat society ball in drag.

1/25/2015,"@csm, thanks guys - for doing that unpaid, time and energy sucking job!@ccp, what can i do to have a timeline on the alliance logo thing then? seems like a thing that could be done easely in a release cycle - if only you'd get the right persons in the sam"
1/25/2015,"also, non-disclosed sov changes... what could possibly go wrong if we hear the terrible things that you are planning?"
1/25/2015,"having heard the plan, i think life in sov null is going to be interesting. i don't think any of us disagreed with the whole plan, just some people disagreeing with certain (different) parts of it. it's still in development though"

1/25/2015,iirc there was talk of possibly having an external titan docking upgrade for outposts where each upgrade allows 1 titan to be docked externaly per upgrade p to some undetermined max amount so the starbase shield is extended around the titan and is made targetable once the starbase shields are down and can be blown up once that happens
1/25/2015,"it's nobody's fault but your own if you are defenseless in this game. last time i checked, newbie accounts still had guns trained by default.no. eve is a pvp game, and pvp belongs everywhere. that includes highsec, whether you like it or not. aside from the fact that this is a sandbox game, not a theme park. if you want a theme park, go play star trek online. stop trying to ruin what i like about this game simply because you refuse to deal with reality."
1/25/2015,"everyone seems to agree that null is broken, but can we step back and say, for sure, how we know this?to my mind, we know it is broken because.......... .... wait for it.............. nothing ever happens in null.i mean, right?null has become empty of content, and the same power players are holding the same positions. null has stagnated.in simple terms, null is a chat room for ""friends of ccp"". big deals, who have always been big deals, get to sit in space and be big deals.we need to confront the psychology and leadership being displayed here. this is not a ""broken mechanic"". in fact, it is working perfectly well. ccp want a chat room for their buddies, somewhere they can be big deals. best friends forever! so, ccp made that. we call it null.and what is wrong with that?seriously, what right do you or i have to tell the good old buddies of ccp that they ought not be big deals? do they hurt us? do we really need to rain on their private chat room, and smear envy everywhere?what about loyalty, as a virtue?what about looking after your good old friends? aren't these virtues, when they apply to us?so, there is a lot of hypocrisy on display here. we all like our own friends. we all want to be big deals with our friends.be fair, and be reasonable. it is ccp's game, and their employees look after their friends. no harm, no foul. indeed, the joy of special friendships is one of the things that separates us from, say, plants.furthermore, high sec is full of fun. you can gank bears, or run missions. so, it is not like null is some big chat room and the rest of us can't play eve. we can play, we can enjoy the joy of life in empire space.do not throw out the good in search of the perfect, is my advice.eve is loads of fun, and full of happy times for interesting people who are prepared to just get on with it and have fun.do not let that go because ccp and special friends want to sit in a massive chat room and have everyone look up to them in awe of their giant ships.most of all, do not expect from a pig but a grunt.if there were to be real strategy in eve null, the fundamental premise would be an entirely different game. wars would be fought for strategic locations, and npc events would constantly confound the best strategies of the best players.when you see a chat room where nothing changes and the same people are sitting in the same places, forever, that is no accident. that is stasis, a condition very difficult to achieve in any dynamic organisation. you could even call it a culture."
1/25/2015,"if the culture were to change.......... then what?eve null, as a strategy game involving wars, is not something that is easy to conceive.none of us, least of all ccp, have any idea how that might look, or how it would be to play.if we are prepared to wonder, we might state some fundamentals, and go from there.just to start the conversation, consider the following ""realities"" of war and strategy:1. npc empires would behave as empires.2. war targets could be forced to move, to undock and fight in order to hold key locations at key times in key places.3. great wealth and power would attract those seeking it for themselves, including npc empires, of course.4. those who hold power would not be consulted regarding how others might ""play the game"".in the end, null is a chat room because ccp chat to players, and listen to them chat.there are a thousand ways eve could be made a strategy war game, including increased npc empire actions and reactions to player stagnation.the idea of a pure sandbox, where players generate content, is both idealistic and vain. it pretends that ccp doesn't listen to player chat, yet simultaneously pretends players will do ""interesting things"" rather than follow narrow, predictable avenues of self interest.if ccp want a strategy game in null, they need to make one. they need to do that work, to create the npc agendas that drive new strategic challenges.without this work, the traditional work of the d&d dungeon master, null will only ever be a chat room.with titans."
1/25/2015,"maybe you should chill and understand peoples concerns. your name comes up in multiple things and non of which are taken lightly when it comes to trusting someone.your attitude just sucks... sorry if that hurts your feelings but you seem to have an arrogance about you... you vibe wrong, your aura is the wrong color... take your pick."

1/25/2015,"this isn't my campaign, i am simply a voter looking to get information on who i am voting for, like i do every year.there are a few things i agree with you on, but i simply do not know enough about you and the things you have allowed yourself to be involved in is just very concerning when it comes to trusting someone with my vote.you have yet to answer any of my questions..."
1/25/2015,"i am reticent to answer your questions when you keep accusing me of being ""involved"" in events i clearly wasn't. i was not in iceland when the monument was vandalized.i was not in iceland when mynnna accused me of following him around.please stop attacking me for stuff i had no part in. if you have questions about my platform or my ideas for eve than i will be happy to answer those."
1/25/2015,you can't just settle with the belief that everyone is targeting you specifically more than others for no reason at all. there has to be a reason for it. easiest way to discover the reason behind a string of similar occurrences is to find the common denominator.
1/25/2015,if you don't have any questions about my platform or csm candidacy than we have nothing to talk about.
1/25/2015,so we shouldn't condo you in game and talk about anything ok we condo condo you in game and ask about eve related subjects since you obviously hate answering questions.
1/25/2015,"so far the only actual question you have answered was mine, and it was ""i dont participate in any way with the larger community, and instead avoid the forums and only talk with my own small group of friends""so again, ill ask the second question, why does that kind of community interaction and experience qualify you for a seat on the csm?"
1/25/2015,um.... what?remember my advise about thinking before you post?yeah...
1/25/2015,"xenuria, you say you lead a large wow guild. however your eve corp history reads like a ""i dont fit in anywhere""."
1/25/2015,you are entitled to your opinion.
1/25/2015,"id still like an answer to my second/followup question, especially regarding the comment you jsut replied to.you admitted you dont post at all really on the forums, by this we can at least infer you dont really read the forums much, you also stated that you dont speak with much of anyone ingame outside people who are already your ""followers"" basically, which i can guess numbers somewhere around 100 or lessso, on to the question, despite having no real forum presence, and no greater eve community presence ingame, why/how do you think you are qualified for a csm position?"
1/25/2015,if you would stop shitting up other candidates threads it would be a lot easier to vote for for you. i agree with most of your ideas; but dude seriously stand on your own merits and quit trying to knock the the other guys down. you are coming off as a bloody politician.
1/25/2015,"you can call it anyway you like it, but when a i see a post i do not agree with, i will speak up. would you rather have a csm member who only agrees with everyone ?"

1/25/2015,"ok less a question and more random thoughts on war decs.is it not better to give the defenders a reason to fight back? maybe give them a reason to come out of there stations or log on and fight back. as at the moment there is nothing to actualy make people want to fight back vs war decer's/greifers. maybe if the defenders win the war they cant get dec'd for a week by anyone else or maybe concord pay the corp all the isk killed. obv if they have been dec'd by two corps and they win 1 loss 1 they should still get the shield for there win.it saves big merc allainces/corps having to have 100's of wars active to get a rookie ship kill on the undock off jita and it actualy makes content rather than something people try to avoid. and maybe a isk reward for the attackers if they win *funds you spent on the war get returned or something similer* which can also lead to the cost of wars being increased so greifers/war dec alliances actualy have to pick targets rather than the *dec all button* which we see at the moment. bountys could be payed at a larger % while at war to the attackers as well. draw's should literaly be no one gets anything and the defenders dont get there *shield* bit of a wall of text but what are your thoughts on this as it is in no way a nerf and does not require any new mods to be made for content to actualy happen.ok question time:1 ""i would suggest, double the war dec costs for the first group (up to 50 players). and let the rest as it is.""by ""let the rest as it is"" i assume you mean leave it at basic cost but should it not be the other way round? make the first war cheaper and all wars after it more? would this not mean getting the most out of your isk as you are actualy having to hunt that set allaince/corp rather than sitting on undocks all day as the more groups you dec the more you have to pay so the less isk back in kills you get?2 im a bit behind on all the cool kid school yard lingo but what does htfu mean and why is it so important to you.3 cookies or ice cream. and what type."
1/25/2015,"the reason to fight back is to keep the corp / alliance alive. that alone should be a good reason. if people cant fight themselves, they could hire mercenaries or call in help from friends. what marmites does isnt any difference then what npsi fleets do. the biggest difference is, we have to pay a lot of isks for it. no isks rewards needed. if it is a paid war dec, they get isks from the client. if it is a fun war, rewards will only make the attacking side richer and we would have even more wars. i can only speak for myself, but sometimes it takes hours to pick targets. looking at past results, have we decced them recently, do we really need to dec them a 3rd+ time, are they big enough (we prefer 25+ member corps/alliances), etc etc. and yes we do have a lot of wars, then again we also pay for it. if you want a lof of shiny ships, you also pay for it. my point, if people are willing to pay the price, why shouldnt they be able to do it. if for example code wants to gank with battleships and pay for them, i say let them. who are we to decide what is good or bad when it comes to people spending their isks ? 1. no, by making the first war more expensive, you avoid getting to many smaller corps decced. the bigger corps/alliances should be able to handle a war. the smaller are still in the proces of setting up things (resources, recruitment, etc).2. htfu = harden the **** up. we have seen so many nerfes in highsec the last two years and no buffs to evilness, it's time we stop this process and even reverse things. if people complain about how hard it is in high-sec now, you should have been here 2 years ago.3. ice cream, lemon / red berries"
1/25/2015,"""the reason to fight back is to keep the corp / alliance alive. that alone should be a good reason. if people cant fight themselves, they could hire mercenaries or call in help from friends. what marmites does isnt any difference then what npsi fleets do. the biggest difference is, we have to pay a lot of isks for it. "" *i suck at this quote milarky and hate fourms ;)*well not really. war dec's dont kill off corps/alliances. they just dont bother logging in or undocking or they just on play on a alt. when dec ends they can just go back to normal. surely giving the defenders a reason to fight back which is more than e-honour would give the attackers more content? more than camping undocks and trade routes anyway and just killing off the daft or ignorant.and as far as im aware npsi does not need to wait 24hrs to start shooting people nor does it need to pay anything to do so. and happily i was there 2 years ago and as far as i can tell its not that much differant than it was back then execpt wars are cheaper now. and you have the option for suspect baiting everyone rather than single corps which is a big + in my mind. though dec shield being removed was slightly anoying as the tears were great."
1/25/2015,"that happens too and in most cases mercs avoid these corps. it is one of the things i look at before we decide to war dec them. but most alliances/corps we war dec do have things to lose. yeh, we might want to nerf that a bit then. it's so unfair to the players they blob."
1/25/2015,"mercenary corps are generally more able to win a war than the targets they pick, both because they train specifically for tht type of combat, and because they pick targets they have a high chance to win against. the reason people don't fight is because there's nothing to gain from fighting a battle you are going to lose. that won;t change. if mechanics force people to fight, then they will find other ways to avoid it. they aren't going to submit to being fodder.and yeah the big question ""are we at least 95% certain to win this war?""it really depends on if your gameplay mechanics are too easily at the expense of others. as it is wardecs are relatively easy and cheap to run. you have hundreds of wardecs, yet the fees you pay are low enough that a solo player could pay for them. that's ludicrously cheap. sure, you should be able to do what you want, but it should be balanced.no, by making the start war cost more expensive you make it more difficult for a small corp to dec another small corp. larger corps would still be able to dec whoever they want. as you stated above, many of your wardecs are paid for by the client, so if the cost to you went up, the cost to them would too. if they weren't paid for by a client, i'm sure the income you have would cover the additional cost."
1/25/2015,"yes, we would like to win all wars we declare. are you saying that any other corps/alliance in eve picks battles so they could lose them ? if that's true, they are doing it wrong.picking new targets brings the risk of not winning a war, which is way more fun. we sometimes go after targets we know are going to hurt u (hint hint).increasing the base price will hurt bigger mercenaries like marmites, as 150 x 50m extra is a lot of isks we have to work for first. we are not an isks-printer. 80% of our wars are not contracts, so we can not just increase a contract price.only thing i do agree with you, is that doubling the base price from 50m to 100m could be bad for smaller (merc) corps. maybe we could only increase it for corps/alliance who have more then an x amount of players ? this way the bigger alliances like marmites pay more and the smaller (merc) corps (who probably do less damage to a target) pay less."
1/25/2015,"try reading. no, that's not what i'm saying. of course you will aim to win, but when your targets realise they can't win and decided to take the action to reduce the impact of their loss, the cried go up about how hey should be ""encouraged"" to actively defend themselves, and by ""encouraged"", of course we really mean ""forced"".you just stated above ""we would like to win all wars we declare"", so which is it? either you declare wars with the intention of winning or you find it more fun to lose wars and therefore are choosing the wrong targets.let's be honest for a moment, since csm candidates should be honest above all else. you want to beat the enemy so you pick targets you have the highest chances of success against. suggesting that you like the risk of not winning is just trying to make yourselves look more honourable than you really are. it's fine to attack easy targets, hell it's expected, but let's frop the pretence.it's 7.5b, which can be near-passively made through t1 production on a single account, or made through trading on a single character. on top of that you make isk through loot and through contracts, and i also understand that many of your wars are paid for by your members too. i don't believe you'd honestly struggle to meet the extra cash, which is why you're comfortable making the suggestion.personally i believe war costs should ramp up considerably more as you start more wars, so that after making 10 - 20 wars are so they start to become insanely expensive and 30+ would make most groups bust.the reason for that is that groups like your own that simply farm wars don't really add engaging content for smaller groups. you'd likely stick with having a bunch of nullsec wars, your contract wars and a few ad-hoc wars. smaller groups would be unaffected as they would be unlikely to have vast quantities of aggressive wars, and overall, mercenary groups would be encouraged to either work on a smaller set of corps or break down into specialised corps. with that change i'd be happy for people to be pushed out of npc corps quite heavily. if people were just forced out as is, groups like yours would just wardec them and we'd just see players dropping out as they are forced to not play or submit to being killed endlessly."

1/25/2015,"perhaps you've not been reading this thread since it's not discussing the awox changes. the point made was that feyd wanted csm members to state that they would automatically reject any change which reduced interaction, which i pointed out as an overly simplistic view to take. kaarous then decided to once again turn it into a massive thread about him whining on about how people want to remove his playstyle.no, ccp take on board ideas and consider them for their merits. if an idea is good for the game but reduces conflict, that may be a cost they are willing to pay. csm members should do the same. in essences, an idea isn't automatically bad because you wouldn't like it. a variety of people play this game and ccp knows and accepts this.it wouldn't be, if that's what actually was happening. realistically this discussion has nothing to do with awox changes, and even if it were it's at most a part of a gameplay style not an entire style in itself (much like how reprocessing was a part of and industry playstyle and that was nuked). the fact that kaarous jumps in pretty much any times anyone mentions the word risk jumping up and down and going on about everything as if it's a suggestion to remove all risk, that is in fact screeching.there's a fairly significant group of people who are unable to have a reasonable discussion around risk in eve. as soon as someone suggest something that would reduce risk, this group throws up the usual strawman about how removing all risk is a terrible idea and they argue at that for eternity.actually, if you read what he's written in there he missed the point. as many people have on the forums he looked at it from the point of view of ""protect the newbies from being shot"" which is not the focus of the change. sure, he's probably the reason it's a toggle, but that argument was because there are legitimate use cases for corp aggression, not because having a toggle is a lesser change.of course that's what seagull has in mind for eve, but that doesn't mean everything should be based around generating conflict on all levels, and is certainly based around the understanding that conflict is more than just shooting people. if the entire game was supposed to be people shooting each other, pve would be removed and it would be converted into a space moba. it hasn't though because eve is a sandbox where a variety of people play with different styles.and i get that you want sabriz, i strongly disagree that people like him are needed though. his campaing in very self-serving. listen to his capstable interview, and you get the understanding that a lot of the changes being suggested are to force people to have to be content for code."
1/25/2015,"time to catch up on replies. starting with the most interesting one, imho, then the hostile ones.i want to address the 'highsec should be nothing more than a kiddie pool' argument.each category of space has game mechanics that define an identity for that space and in doing so promote a type of gameplay.lowsec, for instance, features game rules preventing bubbles and sharply hurting interceptor gatecamps. as a consequence, it's 'identity' is that it's the freefire space where escape is easiest, where supercapitals are at their most powerful*, and rookie systems have their identity set by the rules against non-consensual pvp and the total lack of attractive resources (level 4 mission agents, high end exploration sites, good asteroids, etc). this is what make them the 'kiddie pool'.highsec's identity is set by concord. concord create an environment where more 'neutral' players can coexist in a system than is possible in any other area of space. outside high, it's not possible to have dozens of neutrals in a system except in unusual circumstances. this leads to an environment where a lot of people are willing to undock and act in a system at one time in a way that's just not going to happen outside of cynojammed systems deep in sovereign null.it's also space that allows players to operate when they do not have the capacity to escalate fights. outside highsec, the correct action to take when you spot an opposing force you cannot defeat is to go into lockdown. in highsec, you have the very real option of using the advantages concord provide the defender in engagements to try to deter a superior force from attacking. this makes it conducive to solo play in a way that other areas of space are not.finally, you can't trust concord with your safety, only with retribution. retribution for illegal aggression is certain; your survival is up to your choices.i do not feel that the removal of (non-rookie system) highsec will ever occur, nor would i advocate it. much as non-sov null provides a competitive environment that is different to sovereign nullsec, highsec provides a competitive environment that is different to both.* - supercapitals are, of course, seldom worth fielding in lowsec because outside fw which isn't really all that conducive to capitals, lowsec offers nothing worth fighting for; that's another issue."

1/25/2015,"as for tim's comments.firstly, the removal of awoxing isn't something that can be compared to the reprocessing changes. i'm aware of people who used the old reprocessing system for two things:1) exporting minerals from highsec to null via module compression (i did this, and own several blueprints that were acquired solely for this reason that are no longer being used) and2) reprocessing arbitrage - buying up meta items that have little/no merit as modules and melting them into minerals.1) was replaced with ore compression. different system, same overall result. a few losses were suffered as a result (including me getting stuck with a bunch of now worthless blueprints) but it's not a playstyle being removed.2) remains viable; the prices of the modules where supply exceeds demand have just fallen to a new price point driven by the new reprocessing values.so that playstyle remains viable, it's just a bit less profitable than previously. awoxing is probably not viable at all, although i certainly have ideas to sow terror among corp recruiters. unfortunately these are less viable for new players than the ten hour hero was.now to address the claims that new players will benefit from increased trust from recruiters.most 'career' awoxers will likely change their playstyle to become corp thieves (which means that new players will be less trusted in corp applications than they are now. it was easy to defend yourself from an awoxer - you only needed to carry ecm drones on non-combat ships in corporations with open recruiting. corp thieves are more dangerous and much harder to defend against.other career awoxers will engage in various methods to get blues shot in highsec (i've devised a few). these will catch a lot more newbies in the crossfire than awoxing ever did. expect a lot of newbies to lose ships as a result of the actions of disloyal corp members over the next few months than happens now.the ability to be a disloyal corp member is a key drawcard of eve. the guiding hand social club heist was the first time i heard of eve. the recent 'all reps on cain' incident, bad bobby's fraud - events like those drive interest in the game. and as long as disloyal members of a corp can do damage, any sensible recruiter will take precautions to be as certain as possible that the 'new player' they recruit is not a veteran masquerading as a newbie, and they will take actions to mitigate the damage a disloyal member can do. finally, what's been ignored by ccp mostly is the far-reaching implications of increased safety for career highsec players, because the current csm either don't understand the issues, or don't care about them. as awoxing was pretty much the only viable way to kill a mission marauder, it's a dramatic increase in safety for that type of player. the csm needs people that can pick apart proposed changes to see what the unintended consequences of them will be, not people that accept (or worse, push for) every change that claims to be intended to benefit new players but that actually is aimed at benefiting a specific subset of veterans."

1/25/2015,"i think there is something very telling about the way you phrase this question. when you say ""instead of dealing with the problem,"" you are referring to the problem as it was defined in game: we were consistently losing fights, and were bleeding towers. the problem - from my perspective - was that the members of my corporation were not enjoying flying with the alliance... and that's putting it nicely. what you see as avoiding ""the problem"" and taking the easy way out, i see as dealing with our problem in the most immediate way possible - that is, the problem of my corpmates not enjoying the game. i enjoyed flying with oe while it lasted, but my loyalty remains to those who fly with me in sash.we were not the first to leave, and you were compensated appropriately. i'm fine with being the scapegoat for the current state of your alliance, but you should temper your disdain. yes.eve is a game that we play to enjoy, and no one is under any obligation to do anything at anytime for anyone.csm, on the other hand, is a serious undertaking that was purpose built to solve difficult problems. i'm not running for the csm because i want trip to iceland or because i think it will be fun to sit in meetings during my free time. i'm running for the csm because i truly believe i can make this game better.csm members have a responsibility to those who vote for them, and i will fulfil that responsibility."

1/25/2015,"first, this is just completely untrue. you can't prove these accusations as much as i can't prove them to be false, so i'm going to move on. it's true i was busier during the months of october and november than usual with a difficult work cycle irl, but i sacrificed a lot of other things in order to stay active within the corp - including having to stop writing for themittani.com. ha, and you're accusing me of twisting my words?first, and i'm not sure how this is relevant in anyway, but the titan was not funded with stolen assets.second, ""compensated appropriately"" is a perfectly apt description. the towers were purchased using corp isk, they were managed using corp resources, and when they were lost i sent doom >8b isk to cover the next month's lost profits anyway. i don't know how much you thought those towers were worth, but y'all are acting like i stole my titan from you.third, dotlan doesn't show that at all - you're either lying, or you didn't actually look. if you're ignoring the fact that we were the third major corp to depart the alliance, maybe this would be almost correct. you're still down more than 100 members from when rnest and dboys were apart of the alliance, and the second largest corporation in your alliance is currently in a completely different timezone.fourth, if you're going to quote killboard stats, you best make sure you don't pick and choose which ones you're quoting. you say that your ""isk killed"" has increased from last month - and to my surprise, it has. conveniently, this is thanks to a titan kill that your alliance managed to whore on during one of my npsi fleets on january 3rd. such sweet sweet irony.... but anyway, since we're picking and choosing killboard stats, let me pick one that is not smurfed so easily: ships killed.not only is this number down by more than 60% since november, but your alliance has scored half as many kills as my corporation during the month of january alone. yet dotlan, which you so proudly point out, shows you have more than triple our numbers. i hope you're enjoying it there hair loss - we weren't.lastly, you used all of that to try and claim that i won't share ""true information"" with the players or the developers.... i feel like a broken record - if you actually wanted an answer to this question, you could have read my answer the last three or four times it was asked in slightly different ways. in the end, no matter what i say you're neither going to believe me, nor change your mind. you're not apart of the command team for spectre fleet, so i have no idea how you would know this one way or another. as for never fc'ing for spectre fleet, this is provably - and laughably - false... hell, i was one of the fc's during that fleet where your alliance managed to get on a titan kill. as for the nullsec freeport, you're going to need a citation or two. freeporting a region of nullsec is something that i've always wanted to do, but never actively attempted or invested effort into. are you trying to say that someone else (coelomate) accomplishing something that i've wanted to do discredits me for not having done it myself? i'm not understanding what you're trying to say here. pfr acted completely independent, and their actions occurred during a time when our corporation was apart of a certain alliance in the placid region.... what?? is it so crazy for the cfc to support someone outside of their political boundaries simply because they think it would be good for the game?! i have literally no idea how you immagine nonnak played into that. my only connection to the cfc is through writing for them on themittani.com, where i assume they got to know me and liked what i had to say during my articles regarding the state of the game and combat mechanics. i have a poor relationship with a very vocal minority, so it would seem.as for being inclusive and even-tempered when dealing with others.... i'm answering you, aren't i?"
1/25/2015,thank you! i appreciate the support and am glad that you enjoyed the interview.i look forward to answering whatever questions you come up with.
1/25/2015,"i know you have been fighting off some accusations as of the last couple of replies from multiple people, and i am sorry to have to ask you another tough question.......but i feel its my responsibility....do you support the addition hats into eve?this is one of my platform's key points and it's important i know your stance."
1/25/2015,"i think this is very important to the future of eve, and the hyasyoda automatic transformation system should certainly be applied to characters instead of ships.real talk tho, i'd love hats. way too much of the avatar's clothes are currently hidden by the portrait picture."
1/25/2015,"i'm getting really tired about answering the same questions over and over again regarding my corporation's departure from overload everything. so from here on, i'm not going to answer those questions in this thread - if you ask something that has already been answered i'll send you an evemail including the details of where you can go to read my reply. if you rehash an accusation that i've already fielded during the course of this thread, i'm also going to ignore you. i don't care if you choose not to believe what i've written, that's your choice, just know that asking it again will not receive a different answer.questions related to the csm are, as always, welcomed."
1/25/2015,stop rehashing the same accusation.

1/25/2015,"jayne, i won't ask you a question about it, but this i really have to ask this dude:are you serious? a merc group was hired out by some goons, and that's enough for you to consider ali a goon csm candidate?and believe it or not, goon candidate lists are based around what the goons think would add the most benefit to the game from their point of view. that doesn't mean everyone on it is a goon supporter, indeed some are in fact enemies of the cfc, but their campaigns contain an element that gets them a vote over someone else less desirable.as for jayne's csm x campaign, for what it's worth, i couldn't care less whether or not he took anything from a corp. half of the candidates running have at some point or another done something ""bad"". this is eve mate. that has no reflection on whether or not a candidate will be a good csm member. if you've got problems with his actual campaign then by all means raise them, but if your objections are limited to ""i think he was once naughty in eve"" it's going to fall on deaf ears. so shush.now i actually do have a question. regarding corp lites, social corps, whatever they are being referred to these days would you be in favour of 1. an actual corp where you must leave your existing corp to join them.2. a social group of which you can have one on top of your corp which comes with a corp-like interface, mailing list, channel, etc.3. a ""club"" of which you can be part of many which comes with a corp-like interface, mailing list, channel, etc.4. something different to all of the above.i kinda like the idea of them but am not sure about them being like actual corps. they might move a few npc players out of npc corps into what is effectively a specific npc corp with a channel with people you choose to be with, but the real benefit to them would be if they allowed people from all over to join up and play together. they could even have the ability to have mutual-only wars which either side can stand down with the 24 hour notice to encourage people to fight each other for fun."
1/25/2015,"manny, what are your thoughts on the new player experience in eve? what do you think can be improved upon and adjusted to better incentivize players into subscribing etc.?one point of contention i have with it is, it does a very poor job introducing and preparing players for the concept of permanent loss when undocked and attacked by other players (or when their ship is destroyed by npcs). there is also the problem regularly stated that a new player ""has no clue what there is to do"" when starting out. it could be said this is because the ""sandbox gameplay"" doesn't open up for the player until several hours into the game and beginners tutorial is completed."
1/25/2015,"i disagree with only a few of your points. lowsec offers a permanent docking solution to groups too afraid of centralizing all their assets somewhere vulnerable or committing to the sov game in null with the best excuses given being flexibility, play schedules that cannot be influenced, and freedeom. pretty good damn reasons, imo.once again, the argument that not all lowsec is fw is bad, as most of lowsec that is populated by pirates that happen to be within these regions that fw takes place in. fw is the beating heart of lowsec. that is the plain truth of it. lowsec is big, try taking a stroll down those non-fw lanes and see how busy they are.lowsec should have a cap of 300 pilots on corp offices, with a limit to one corporation of each alliance being able to pull an office at any given station. these demands are pretty realistic. another part of lowsec is the moons. you did not mention that in any of your answer. snuff, shadow cartel, pl, and even goons have moons in low, with 1010101 mainly having poco domination in essence by an indie corp with a funny name.the sigs are pretty profitable, but, again, many non-fw entities farm these. the increase of available indie slots changes little for us. a refining bonus and manufacturing bonus would be amazing, but they would be taken advantage (just like the science slots were before teams came out) by non-fw parties if they are not specifically available to those that dump their earnings for the upgrades."
1/25/2015,"problem with the ishtar is that people fight the ship. you don't fight the ship, you fight their drones. removing 125m3 from it's active drone bay would be enough. it's versatility is in being able to abandon and push out whatever set is best as a counter during a fight. at the very least you force them to back off and mobile depot more drones into the bay. as it is, you have to do this 3 times if they carry 2 sets of sentries and/or whatever else will take up the last 125m3 - maybe a 3rd set?it is a good ship. people just don't know how to fight them. when in doubt fit for explosive damage nubs! and learn falloff and optimals of each sentry."
1/25/2015,"manny is a great guy that cares a lot for the game and is not afraid to push changes that are unpopular with people, if he thinks it will benefit the game. he will be my #1 any day.as for questions, what is your opinion on the topic of destroyable outposts, especially in the context of the incoming sov changes?"
1/25/2015,"new player experience - yes as in easy start for new player, not realy ""a n00bie only area""occupancy based sov - anything as long the masses are happyplayer operated starbases - any change that makes me start using them would be nice and maby adding new activities related to them tooship balance & iteration - t3 rebalance yes, minutes say about ehp nerf ""ccp fozzie also added that the effective hit point (ehp) affecting sub-systems are also going to be toned down."".nullsec industry - what does the null actualy lack in this case it got moons for moon mining it has ores thay even buffed the high end one in that way so they give low end minerals too, you got unlimited slots. what does it lack ? is it to dangerous move the mats betwen stations... it's null. nerf jf in such way that it forces blocks to produce in there space ??lowsec - lowsec isn't only fw space"
1/25/2015,"you seem to be good at pr and marketing, but can you tell me what experience you have with eve, how long you been playing the game and some opinions on hot eve topics ?"
1/25/2015,"as a past member of my rvb fleets back in the day, khador and i have had some good times. i will vote for you when ccp announced changes with corp-aggression my first tears were shed for rvb, so many events like the massive ffa's will be lost. i am glad you are running for changes to the system."

1/25/2015,"i forgot to link the just for crits interview i did a few weeks ago, but it's at"
1/25/2015,"so as previously pointed out, you only attended 5 csm meetings during the winter summit. care to explain why we should vote for someone who doesn't attend?"
1/25/2015,you should vote for someone who attend the meetings where he feels that he can actually contribute with stuff. besides we get recordings and minutes that are not redacted and sometimes irl work gets in front of spaceship politician work.
1/25/2015,"correct me if i'm wrong, but am i supposed to interpret this as you considering the topics you chose not to attend as irrelevant and unimportant?"
1/25/2015,every meeting listed is relevant to the game. disappointed to hear you say that. i simply can't vote for someone this closed minded.
1/25/2015,"not to detract from the discussion of your involvement with the csm's role at the summit meetings but i had a question for you gorski.as someone who has played the game with a wide variety of player groups, what are your thoughts on the new player experience in eve in general? you are currently in rvb which is, to some, a solid starting area to learn the basics of how pvp works in eve. what do you think can be improved upon and adjusted to better incentivize new players into venturing down the path of pvp and eventually subscribing?one point of contention i have with the tutorials is that it does a very poor job introducing and preparing players for the concept of permanent loss when undocked and attacked by other players (or when their ship is destroyed by npcs). there is also the problem regularly stated that a new player ""has no clue what there is to do"" when starting out and simply runs missions and so forth as commented on by ccp rise at eve vegas. it could be said this is because the ""sandbox gameplay"" doesn't open up for the player until several hours into the game and beginners tutorial is completed. your thoughts?"
1/25/2015,corporation: verge of collapsewh csm meeting scheduled in advance: not relevant?guess that is all there is too know about this csm x candidate.
1/25/2015,"having known gorski for some time, i just have this to say:to me, small gang and solo pvp is everything in eve. i also strongly think that it is the genesis to 99% of the 'content' found here. the complexity, nuance,the tactical and strategic depth found in this amazing game are nothing short of jaw dropping. sadly i feel that 99% of the eve playerbase (including the csm) doesn't see or understand this. gorski is the only csm candidate that i would fleet with. having flown with him many times, i know for a fact that he understands. he, like me- can see the importance of solo / small gang and from what he has been doing with the csm i strongly believe that gorski is our man."
1/25/2015,you know jayne i wanted to vote for you. then you you did this. you took all that moronic stuff seraph always spouts and tried to top it. how about you stay off other candidates threads and stand on your own?
1/25/2015,the new player experience is kinda lacking at the moment. i know ccp rise are working on it and i've seen some prototype images that look a bit better. getting people into solo and small gang is harder though. this is a mmo and people want to be social and just shoot stuff while talking to their friends. going out alone can also feel frightening since you dont have anyone holding your hands etc. in most cases you are also going to lose isk doing it with no srp that you get in bigger fights. honestly i think that people who go out solo must want to do it themselves and get better at eve. i belive that things like garmonation or any other pvp video made more people try solo pvp then any guide or tutorial will do. the barrier of entry is not actually that high to solo but there are some things that the new player experience never teach. manual piloting tactics such as slingshotting or moving to maximize tracking are never taught and those are learned by practice and searching youtube tutorials. i think ccp should push pvp videos a bit more and they are doing a great job by adding some in their devblogs. i think ccp needs to push lowsec and faction warfare more for smaller scale and beginner level pvp. the problems right now with these is that either you lose sec status fast and is punished by not having access to highsec as a new player or your standings get ****** from faction warfare and that's even harder to fix.
1/25/2015,"corps aside, this game is divided by user interest. regardless of greater organization we all have out niches that really make eve worth logging into.csm's while having their focuses are in the csm to make the audiences of their respective interested heard. regardless of content it is your job to make those meetings. you are a voice for people in this game, they voted for you and they stand behind their actions (i myself am one of them). unfortunately you will be losing my vote this coming election. it is you job to make those meetings and put in your perspective. that is why you are on the csm. not only do you now argue that your actions are justified, you brag and push off questions regarding your lack of commitment.continually, why would you assume that wh's are not perfect places for small gang pvp? you should be ashamed of yourself. i am ashamed that i voted for you."
1/25/2015,"if he had as he implied real world work to attend to which, you know, makes sure he has a roof over his head etc. you can't really get mad at him over that choice. he also stated there are non-nda'd notes for him to review and he has the means to talk to ccp about those topics in secure venues after the meeting took place. it appears to have been a decision between a meeting about internet spaceship pixels so as to appease privileged people like you and i, or sort out real world issues that could include making sure he has a roof over his head at night. not everyone on the csm can be a trust fund baby."
1/25/2015,"are you equally ashamed of voting for mynnna a guy who does a ton on the council but also couldn't make any summit meetings?it is no secret that i am not a fan of small gang pvp in wormholes. due to the mechanics with how wormholes work you need to split your gang up and cover both sides. most of the time you cant sacrifice 2-3 guys to control both sides. there is also a bigger barrier of entry to small gang lowsec pvp such as probing, logistics and finding fights. i think thera really helped wormhole small gang pvpers and general roaming small gang corps. having stations makes logistics easier and the massive numbers of exits have made me and my corp move into thera and base out of it for roaming. my definition of small gang is less then 10 people often 5 or less.so short answer for why i am not the biggest fan of wh small gang pvp: the fleets you run into are not easily engage able by my gangs and i get more content out of low and 0.0 space. now i'm not saying how small gang pvp in whs are non existant just not perfect in my eyes. we will see what happens after the t3 rebalance."
1/25/2015,"reading through csm winter summit minutes and i can see xander is definitely very (if not the most) involved with the decisions and discussions. he is always there asking questions, giving suggestions. from what i've seen i can say that he really takes his job at csm seriously and not afraid to take responsibility.you earned a place in my ballot =).also if you check his lines in those minutes he is bold with the topics and questions! definitely the csm we need and the csm ccp deserves :p"
1/25/2015,"xander,as someone who works with me on the eve101.com project, what are your thoughts on the new player experience in eve in general? what do you think can be improved upon and adjusted to better incentivize new players into venturing down the path of pvp and eventually subscribing?one point of contention i have with the tutorials is that it does a very poor job introducing and preparing players for the concept of permanent loss when undocked and attacked by other players (or when their ship is destroyed by npcs). there is also the problem regularly stated that a new player ""has no clue what there is to do"" when starting out and simply runs missions and so forth as commented on by ccp rise at eve vegas. it could be said this is because the ""sandbox gameplay"" doesn't open up for the player until several hours into the game and beginners tutorial is completed. your thoughts?"
1/25/2015,xander is legit a great guy. you will get my votes.
1/25/2015,"sup hendrick. cheers for the question.the npe was a huge topic of conversation at summit. it clearly needs improvement. there's no shocker there. not gonna lie - regarding your 'loss' comment, i completely agree however it didn't really come up at summit. i think your second comment kind of brings up the bigger issue which isn't just teaching players the basics, it's pushing them in some kind of direction in eve. the tutorials do a bad job of that at the moment. ccp showed us some 'very' cool ideas for where they could go with this in the future. we made 'very' clear that ccp should actually go and do these things. i hope they do. if they do, i think the npe will be so much better.sorry for being vague but yeah, ccp are aware of the issue, they have some very solid ideas on how to solve it and i hope they follow through."

1/26/2015,"word.my dot at the center of concentric circles just isn't doing it for me anymore ;), plus all the ""incredible"" youtube videos showing colored brackets is a headscratcher for just about everybody.alot of what made ""this is eve"" great, beyond the awesome comms, was seeing actual ships...just sayin..."
1/26/2015,"i agree, seeing your environment is overrated, we should just use our imaginations to visualize conceptually what the readouts mean....oh wait, isn't that called a mud......seriously though, what would this game be like if you could only zoom out to like 10k or something...scary thought...our handy camera in my view actually breaks immersion quite a bit, and makes no sense physically (from a physics perspective) and is way too convenient..."
1/26/2015,"from reddit:it relies on some factors, yes. worm holes can be close to the sun and d-scan can be quick. if there is a resident afk cloaker they can go right to the perfect spot directly. for miners, there is the day dreaming factor. you relax, slow down, have to find and click the right book mark or thing from the overview.the attacker is jazzed up, full of adrenalin and intent aimed right on the hunt.miners will have slower reactions, just how humans work."
1/26/2015,"posting in a thread where people complain about well planned attacks working.without cloaky ships and cynos you get large portions of 0.0 where carebears and botters can sit around all day and make isk without any risk. local lets them know when they enter system, intel channels let them know when the enemy is 10 jumps away and thus they can dock/pos up and bears roll in isk minimizing pvp."
1/26/2015,regarding newbies and the bloodlines.
1/26/2015,"i oppose two of your platform issues, so i must be in code?"
1/26/2015,"jen is a troll - marmitejen would be a terrible csm member - code.that is essentially all they said. there was nothing to discuss. you actually make a stance dradis, that i can try refute or negotiate with you about it. frigates are easier to kill and disrupt the cyno they light. i would actually prefer if t3s couldn't cyno."
1/26/2015,"yes this tactic i have seen in person in a system.while i do like it for its simplicity it does hamper game play and pvp fights, they know what we deploy to fights and can counter it long before we are encountered. it also hampers pve and mining ops, we cant mine well with good efficent ships or rat in good efficent ratting ships.generally cloaking should use alot more cap or a fuel source."
1/26/2015,"""they know what we deploy to fights and can counter it ""why would a small group want to go head to head with a sov holding alliance such as yourself.""stop moving so i can hit you!"" come on..."
1/26/2015,"again, i have to question your null sec knowledge."
1/26/2015,"considering i've been involved/been writing about 0.0 for the past 3 or 4 years, i think your question says more about you."
1/26/2015,"clear example pops to mind. they had less than 20 guys in their corp and gave us hell for a long time. they knew how to uses the mechanics, (yes some multi-boxing) and their pilots effectively.what they did can easily be achieved by 50 determined guys. look at the recent solar system that was reclaimed by a small group. so again, you seem rather ignorant from my perspective."
1/26/2015,yes i'm ignorant of the carebear-want to turn eve into a theme park-want pvp to be optional perspective.
1/26/2015,that is a cop-outin response i direct you to this:i am trying to get orcas and rorquals into mining belts and have more fights. so seraph: does that sounds like your typical carebear? the strangest thing of all is that there is so much anti-afk hate for miners ........ and yet ...... let us defend afk cloaking like they want to take our air away!
1/26/2015,"about the afk cloak issue. i don<U+FFFD>t think means to uncloak ships at will would be good. that goes against the idea of cloaking ships for espionage or safe transport..on the other side, having camping pilots who just log in and cloak in some safe spot and goes away is against the idea that the game is meant to be played.so some risk should be added for balance.a simple solution would be to have a timer so that the ship would decloak if no orders were given to it (afk). it can be a long one(1-2 hours) and with some sort of early warning so the pilot can react to avoid decloaking.if some structure solution would be the way, it could be something like an ""particle emmiter"" with a very low percentage to decloak ships in pulses. hardly effective to decloak active ships at will but could be a threat for afk cloakers. just suggestions, anyway...of course those wouldn<U+FFFD>t work with the new recon ships dscan invisibility. but this is another issue..."
1/26/2015,boosts only work when ship is on grid. bam. solved.
1/26/2015,"so, the orca / rorqual stays out of rat range, keep aligning between two poses or safe points, has a cloak and runs away as soon as a red is within 3-5 systems?that is if people do not:- stop using boosters- stop mining all together.you put 2 seconds thought into that post like all the others, right?this is probably along the sort of lines that is the best compromise, much like the fuel to cloak ideas. however, there are a lot of ways to seem like you are at the keyboard when you are not. (like attach a pencil to a fan and have it tap a key over and over) even if you have to have someone sit on a structure and flip it on to de-cloak people while others hunt and you can only do that every 5-10 minutes per system at least it means you remove the afk cloakers."
1/26/2015,"boosts don't work if you're cloaked. are you f&$%ing serious?so if we got rid of afk cloakers suddenly orcas would be in belts because....?no one is going to stop mining all together. if people stop mining, profit on mining goes up. thus people will go mining to get that isk.2 seconds is about twice as long as you seem to have put into your campaign."
1/26/2015,"it's been interesting talking to alliance members as to why i endorse you being on the csm.i took a poll as to how many code. people have used your tools and it was surprisingly large. whether it's us building light neutron blaster iis, or getting tags for highsec legality, even we use them a lot.nonetheless, i did take the liberty of getting alliance leadership to throw in a wardec toward you."
1/26/2015,[sarcasm]yay.[/sarcasm]guess it's time to shift transport to redfrog/push. and get some fittings for the small stockpile of cyclones (the price didn't change as much as i hoped)
1/26/2015,"i would be interested to hear your opinion on dec dodging, as well as any thoughts you might have on making concord less of a binary, un-interactive mechanic."
1/26/2015,"concord exists to define high-sec. unlike other npcs, they are the embodiment of a mechanic. that mechanic exists to stop newbies, and people who prefer to play the game in a more solo/casual fashion being strangled on the vine.note, solo doesn't mean ""doesn't interact with people"". it's ""doesn't want to have to depend on other people"" and ""doesn't want to have people depending on them"". i'm fairly happy with where it exists at the moment. we've seen in the past what happens when it's less than absolute (see, siege of yulai.)war-decs are a complicated subject. there needs to be a way to force conflict in highsec, so, for example, moons can change hands. dec-doging indicates that the corporation had nothing to hold the players in it. that's something i'd like to change. a benefit to staying with an established corporation, rather than disbanding and reforming. any other approach will lead to people just not playing. which is less than ideal. it happens even now. people get decced, then don't log on for a week, until the wardec goes away. this sucks, both from a gameplay perspective, and from a business perspective. you can't 'force' someone to fight. you can only make it worth their time. (and then you run into the situation where the war deccer wants to fight. so may maintain a wardec, if the target fights back. which makes the optimal route to hide)as i said, a complicated subject. no 'simple' fix for it.(as an aside, grrr! you're a bad person sabriz, forcing me to fight the pos system, to get defences online)"

1/26/2015,"so it's end of discussion because you can't responds as you know full well the changes you suggest would be minimal in impact on you despite your claims to the contrary. the last thing the csm needs is someone like yourself looking out purely for their own interests above the needs of the game. if you aren't willing to look at things from other peoples views, and you're going to try to put down other csms by shitting up their threads, then why don't you just do the whole game a favour and withdraw your campaign.and yes, you are a carebear, you just operate in a different way. you are easily as risk averse as any highsec miner, and you push for changes to further benefit yourself with no regard for how it affects others, so yeah, that's pretty much carebear."
1/26/2015,yes.
1/26/2015,"i'm sure that attitude will get you very far.ok, questions for the csm candidate:1. why is it you want change which primarily benefit your playstyle at the detriment of others?2. how do you explain that your campaign has vastly changed direction since you've started it. it seems that you pretty much just say what people want to hear rather than having a solid vision yourself, which is not really a good attitude for a csm candidate.3. how can a leader of a group which is as risk averse as any other highsec carebear and twice as self-serving claim to be for adding risk?4. do you believe csm members can be dishonest? you suggest changes which will make it harder for small independent groups to declare war while minimally increasing the price for yourself. you are using that change as a ""cost"" so that people find it more acceptable to be in favour of your real idea which is the addition of dreadnaughts to highsec which would allow you to dominate structure combat in wars, undoubtedly going after as many research towers as you can."

1/26/2015,"i'm not. i'm not talking about a single change. the topic of discussion is not awoxing, no matter how many times you guys bring it up. what i'm saying is that a csm who's approach to *all changes* is ""reject automatically if they reduce conflict"" is not a good approach to have.and i think sabriz is qualified only to serve his own interests. clearly he doesn't even acknowledge the existence of other types of players as his campaign outline makes clear.marketing propaganda. eve is a game, a moderately alright game at most, and there's *nothing* about it that would make it hard core. it's insanely easy to recover from losses passively. so it allows scams and unwanted pvp, that's not what makes a game hard core. on top of all that, it's got a gradually disintegrating developer, and a shrinking community that's becoming more and more taken over by toxic hate-driven players by the day.at the end of the day, eve is field with all types of player. if you really think the game is going to shift towards favouring a single playstyle, you're kidding yourself, which is why there are many changes that have gone through and are on the way which have not involved increasing how much players shoot each other. as with most games, players like yourself claim you want conflict, but you only want conflict against players who don't want it, because they are easy prey. if the game shifts too much focus to shooting each other they lose the ""prey"" and then the aggressors get bored and quit. if ccp had no intention of supporting other playstyles, i'm sure they'd remove them."
1/26/2015,"awoxing also remains viable, which is the point. you can still join a corp and rob them, you can lure them into war targets, you can even lure them into lowsec/nullsec and shoot them yourself. the only thing you can't do is shoot them in highsec. just like the reprocessing changes, it's only one part of the style that's going.thieves can be guarded against with roles. and sure, there were ways to protect yourself if you assumed that people were going to be awoxers, but why would you set up a corp and have a whole list of things to do to avoid being awoxed when you could simply slap a minimum sp barrier on and get rid of the chance of recruiting a fresh awox alt?i'm in full agreement that behavioral changes also make awoxing difficult but you can't patch behavior. people haven't been recruiting, they have been putting in minimum sp barriers. no amount of jumping up and down and telling them to recruit noobs will make them actually do it. so ccp is removing that risk so people can more freely recruit noobs.i'm sure some will at first, but now they'll have to go out of their way to do it and use much more complex techniques, so it will still be less of a risk to recruit noobs. essentially your argument here is the terrorism argument: ""if you make this change i'm going to blow up even more people than before!"".except ""that player"" already could have increased safety. most are in their own alt corps. go ahead, try to awox this character. if you get into the corp i'll even undock.you would only push for changes which benefited your playstyle though. your interview on capstable makes that abundantly clear. you want to force more people into combat regardless of whether or not they enjoy that playstyle. you want to create a more target rich environment, which is great if you're the one shooting, but not so much if you are a target. the csm needs people who will consider all players needs, not just what benefits themselves."
1/26/2015,"even csm member steve ""fuzzysteve"" ronuken, industrialist extraordinaire, gets that every change to the game should be primarily considered as to whether it increases or reduces confilct. of course, the reality of eve is complex and people can disagree on the outcome of a proposed change as the intracorp aggression mechanics have shown, but it is completely reasonable, and good for the game, for ccp and the csm to ask themselves if a proposed change is going to increase or decrease conflict overall in the game, and reject those that will reduce it straight out.the csm needs more members that understand eve at its heart is about conflict like sabriz and steve do. what the csm does not need are more wishy-washy csm members who are willing to water down the unique aspects of the game to try to make eve into something it is not for all-comers. i am all for changes that make the game better and more accessible to new and/or casual players, but not at the cost of reducing the conflict and competition that is at the very core of what makes this game such an engaging and unique experience. ok, i have had my say on this. if you want to discuss this further, let's make a thread in the csm subforum and we can ask what the other csm members think, or if you have an actual question for sabriz, you can continue this discussion with him here."
1/26/2015,"regardless of who's agreed to it in principle, it's a dumb idea. what your saying is that regardless of what benefits and idea may have or what other ideas it's consideration may lead to, that an idea put forward which reduces conflict should simply be dismissed. it's far too simple a view to take, and if ccp ever take that view it will be an incredibly sad day for eve.so he doesn;t agree with feyd, therefore he's a ""wishy-washy"" csm? stop being ridiculous. the way you play is not the *only* way the game should be played, and all players should be represented. you want only your position to be represented so that you benefit, regardless of what that means for other players.conflict isn't at the core of an engaging experience. it's at the core of your experience. plenty of other types of players exist in eve"
1/26/2015,hello sabriz. i have only listened to a small part of one of your soundcloud pieces on wardecs but i like the idea of adjusting the payment so that smaller attackers pay less and corps with many members or corps pay much more to start a wardec. i would probably go with higher figures than you mentioned for really large corps and alliances to launch wardecs. 140 million is still coins on the ground for larger entities. i know of miners who would really like to gain a small percentage of extra yield in return for staying in one player run corp. two or three percent doesn't sound much to some people but it would indeed be attractive to most miners. personally i would say no one would be allowed to stay in an npc corp after they have been 'alive' for two months and people found recycling to continue to do so would be perma-banned. do you have an opinion on that idea.i don't think the 'new player experience' ie the tutorial is fit for purpose either. do you have any thoughts on that one ?do you have an opinion on the skiff mining vessel in relation to the other mining vessels available in regards to the skiff not having any negatives but seemingly all positive values ? i ran a discussion on the forum on this issue initially coming from a standpoint that the skiff was too hard to remove from asteroid belts. this morphed into a view that the yield on the skiff should be reduced by a percentage determined by ccp to rebalance it compared to the other mining vessels.
1/26/2015,"i want to highlight that being a corp thief does not show up on your api or your killboard. oh sure you might see that they withdrew x isk from the corp wallet, but what does that mean? nothing. it could mean a hundred different things. corp on corp aggression awoxing is very easy to spot on killboards if you just look for it. catching awoxers is about to get a lot harder."
1/26/2015,"new player experience does indeed need work. some detailed fitting tutorials (like 'here's a fit for pve, and why it works. here's a fit for pvp, and why it works. here's the price you pay for trying to mix the two, whether you do it or not is up to you'). i think npc corps serve an important role as a fallback place for someone that suffers a catastrophic defeat. i'm more for adjusting taxation so that npc corps are clearly the wrong choice for career highsec isk grinders, rather than forcing someone that loses everything into an npc corp immediately. with respect to the skiff. i think it serves its purpose well as the 'tanky mining ship that can fight back'. what it does too well is the actual mining. its yield is close enough to that of the mack and hulk that taking the risk of fielding a non-skiff exhumer is not rewarded. not sure on the exact numbers, but i would support a change that went along the lines of -10% skiff yield, +5% mack yield, +8% hulk yield. i feel that using non-mining scouts and a hulk fleet should be viable, whereas at present it's (usually) more sensible to have your whole fleet in skiffs with one orca."
1/26/2015,"exactly.i am trying to get votes from the whole of the eve player base. most of core's support comes from provi bloc and some other alliances, which is the smart way to become a csm. it is more ""guaranteed"" votes and far less effort.heads up core:people do want as complete a list of the things you have done this last year as possible without breaking nda. your name and lazy are being thrown together far too often from all over, reddit, this forum, other forums, youtube, et cetera. please refute them, your ideals and the way you help shape providence should remain an influence on the csm.there are also others who are trying to straw man you .at this juncture, i feel i need to point out that i used to not display what corp or alliance i am in on these forums. i have added my alliance so that it is open and above board that i am in the same corp and alliance as core.check my post history. my interests in csm pre-date even hearing about volt."
1/26/2015,+1 from me!
1/26/2015,"i've deliberately run through the npe myself twice recently. it is improved in some ways, but the incredibly low number of skillpoints means that much of the time is spent waiting a few hours to train up enough to fit the stuff that makes it bearable.i was asked about this on capstable last night, and what i mentioned was the gulf between the npe for wow and eve. wow is brilliantly planned with very regular, well-signalled and effective improvements: - you appear and there is the npc who gives you a mission.- a few minutes in and you gain a level.- a few minutes and you finish a quest that gives you a better weapon or armour or wand or something similar- a few minutes more and the increasingly addictive ""ding!"" of another level occurs- even playing at true newbie speeds, within an hour you have new spells, new abilities and so forth.- by the end of that first larval-stage, enthusiastic session you are probably tenth level, getting a new trait and moving onto the next zone.everything is laid out clearly, progressing you and ensuring that you are never hanging around waiting for something before you can proceed. go back to being a new player with today's tiny number of skillpoints, able to do sod all, and it is a lesson in frustration and cockblocking."
1/26/2015,"that being said, the new player experience does get rid of the people who are not prepared to find other games to play while waiting around for eve to let them have fun. you cannot get a more realistic training experience for eve than that."
1/26/2015,"so, per your response, you would suggest increasing or adjusting the types of skills granted to a player at the start (perhaps have ""industrial"" ""pvp"" etc. optoins to choose from that gives you the skills/skillbooks immediately to train) as well as streamline the process of explaining the base level mechanics?"
1/26/2015,"i think that vastly accelerated training for the first few hours and days of the character's existence might be one aspect of it (this has been done before with implants), but i think that there is a need for a more guided and rewarding new player experience, and one that occurs somewhere that the rest of us cannot get at them: the equivalent of other games' ""newbie zones""."
1/26/2015,"the first issue i can see with accelerated skills is the abuse (eg. people making a mass of maulus alts) it could lead to. though, i'm sure a balance or even subsequent tweaking can be done to stem that to some degree."
1/26/2015,"i don't know if that's really an issue; mauluses can be trained extremely quickly as-is.the most egregious part of new player skills to me is that you need to wait 6 hours to train into mwd, which is one of the most basic modules to me. it also requires knowing how useful it is and exactly what to train into, which isn't apparent to newbros. i wonder if it would be more useful to just let newbros fit neatly every t1 module from minute 1.so that's my question to you: do you think newbros should be able to fit every t1 module from minute 1? (i'll leave out extremely specialized modules like bomb launchers and triage. on the fence whether to include cloaking devices or not.)"
1/26/2015,"lucas,if you can get past your siege mentality (grr goons all day everyday) you will notice i was actually in your alliance at one point. i also never said anything about being tied to goons being a negative. i asked a question which i know a lot of people wanted to know the answer to."
1/26/2015,having a mercenary contract with an entity doesn't make you a apart of that coalition nor part of a coalition's political leanings. hthjayne since this got lost in the kerfuffle of oe coming in an complaining about you in the same way over and over again like a bitter ex-girlfriend:i would still like to know your thoughts.
1/26/2015,"oops. forgot about this question. sorry!what do i think will improve new player retention?well, i'm going to make this a two part answer. first, the most important thing that ccp can do to improve new player retention is to keep ccp rise (and his team) working on tutorial and npe overhaul, as he presented at eve vegas. link here. his presentation went in depth into player testing with gamers who had no previous experience in eve, and discussed what players were able to accomplish and what they got hung up on while trying to learn the game. i won't bother recounting the entire presentation, but it really was quite fantastic. i agreed with everything that was said and am really excited to see some of these changes come into effect. if you haven't seen it, you should really give it a watch.... or just go to eve vegas. :pokay, since i assume i can't just defer my answer to the work of a current ccp dev, i'll include a bonus thought regarding a facet of the npe that wasn't covered in ccp rise's presentation at eve vegas. although the high-level ui was discussed, i think that the default overview is something that really is in desperate need of a overhaul. ccp karkur has done a great job in recent months of patching the otherwise dysfunctional system with sharable overviews, but the default overviews given to a new player are absolutely atrocious. a single tab literally labelled ""default"" with no information presented regarding how to customize your overview, let alone that you can customize them in the first place.knowing what's in space is important, that much is obvious. being able to identify the important overview items quickly makes pve a lot easier, and makes pvp at least viable. the default overview makes playing this game really hard - way harder than it has to be - and takes a non-insignificant amount of in game knowledge to be able to customize it appropriately. i know this because i've built my own custom overview packs in the past, and to truly customize your overview to a point where you can actually see what's around you in space requires a working knowledge of xml, or more recently, yaml. there is zero reason, and zero excuse, why ccp can't provide a functional default overview that contains at the very least multiple streamlined tabs. i can only imagine how hard it is for new players to see the beauty of this game when they're looking at it through coke-bottle glasses."
1/26/2015,"number 3 on your list is the closest to the proposal that i agree with.although there are a lot of voices proposing different versions, under a lot of different names, the original purpose of the proposal was to give the current non-corporate entities the tools and framework in order to prosper as well as giving players from different vocations more opportunities to interact with one another. take for example, player x.player x is in a large sov holding coalition. to be a part of this coalition, he has to be a part of a corporation, which is a part of an alliance. this is the primary ""banner"" that he flies under. now, let's say that player x wants to join a special interest group (sig) within that coalition that either uses specific ships (ex. bombers) or operates in a specific timezone. these people could form a ""club"" that allows for communication and organization between the individuals who are interested in that type of content.now let's say that player x doesn't want his involvement in a ""club"" or ""society"" to be known, maybe he's actually a spy for a different coalition, a leader of amarrian roleplayers, or - worst of all - a lore aficionado and researcher trying to unearth the secrets of the children of light (hi, mark). the idea is that these groups would not show up on your employment history, unless you wanted them to (ex. decorations) and would allow you to be involved with any and all groups that you wanted simultaneously - or maybe none at all, if that's your thing.you'll notice that none of these examples overlap with roles held by current corporations, and that's for the simple reason that ""social groups"" were never meant to replace corporations or provide an alternative. the proposal was intended to be in addition to the corporation system, allowing for a player to become involved in numerous activities within eve. these ""clubs"" or ""societies"" would not be able to own structures, conquer regions, etc. for that, and anything related to building an empire, the corporation mechanic should remains at the forefront.tl;dr - players already interact with one another in a myriad of ways that are not governed by corporation and alliance mechanics. i just want to give them a way to interact with each other in a more meaningful way, and to help players find others with similar interests. permanent chat channels, mailing lists, community directory, fleet finders, fittings, bulletins, calendars.... give the players the tools and i think we'll all be surprised with what the community can come up with.side note: your war idea is interesting, and not one that i've heard of before.i'm going to have to think on that one more before answering."
1/26/2015,"updating the overview is actually not a terrible idea. although not a unique suggested you nonetheless deserve credit for at least pointing it out. the possibility to share overviews in game was one of the best features that was added. anyway ""your"" idea here while decent lays in stark contrast with your ""club"" idea and i'll show you exactly where things go bad.hm ok, i can follow a bit. but then i'm asking myself ""isn't this just a mailing list and a channel?"" i mean there could be a way that you can click ""join club: boogy bombers"" and automatically be added to the mailing list and chat i suppose. but it's really not that hard to just join a mailing list and a chat. what exactly do you get for joining a ""club?"" isn't this just adding formality to a group that's key appeal is the informality of it all?here's where our difference in mentality lies. we can agree that there were public fleet type organizations in the form of agony and rvb. however bombers bar is really what kicked off the npsi renaissance. the group more or less formed together in march/april of 2012. fcs such as temp, epoc, abiss, eatsbabies, myself and others were working with fleets between 7 to 12 people. it was a big deal when bombers bar channel broke 50 people. so everything was very informal, very grass roots and still fairly small. it wouldn't be until bb migrated from the north (m-o and ec-p8r) in the summer of 2012 to the south (hed-gp) that you would see bb breaking 100 people in channel. it was during this time that we blew up with our exploits being publicized through eve media such as en24. fleets were 20-40 people on a nightly basis. we were ganking the hed-gp jump bridge, we were blowing up test fleets in delve, then cfc fleets in tribute. we were everywhere. with growth came certain individuals that may have had the best intentions but unfortunately politicized the atmosphere. we had councils, voting, economics. it really took away from the npsi concept and turned a lot of the original founding members away including myself.it was just around this time (late 2012) iirc that you even became involved with bombers bar. so what you saw was an entity that was no longer the grass roots form of npsi. you found a highly political and some would say, corrupt, entity that resembled a perverted version of what npsi was meant to be. you never had the ""grass roots"" experience to know any different as you directly piggybacked off of bombers bar. most of 2013 you were involved in the ""political"" version of bb culminating in the ""redeemer awox of temp"" event, and the coup within bombers bar and true foundation of spectre fleet. i never really took much issue with this as venga (the parent corp of bb) was the entity that allowed such gross misconduct to occur. (if you would have been a little smarter about things, i'd probably would have helped you do a better job of it. unfortunately...the company you keep gives such great advice... )their ceo was always more interested in ratting than being an actual ceo. long time members such as temp and epoc have finally left as well.so tldr is you don't have any concept of what ""true npsi"" is because you're initial experience with it was a perverse politicized version of it, not the original. your idea of ""clubs"" is simply the continued reasoning you follow based on that experience. the whole concept is anti-npsi.is there even a demand to hide people's involvement in npsi? so here's an idea nobody even really asked for.so what is the point? what does this give you over a mailing list and a chat? again just introducing structure for a concept that thrives on being more or less structureless.you already have all of that..."
1/26/2015,"i really like your ideas on this sort of ""clubs"" thing. the ability to have a more structured form of nspi fleets and provide better tools for management would benefit the community as a whole, the idea could be used in many different situations, depending on what additional tools could be involved with the club. you have my vote :)"
1/26/2015,will your club mechanic be working as intended when the inevitable happens and there's really only 2 large npsi groups and their assorted lackeys a la goons vs. n3 ?
1/26/2015,npsi cant be broken down into a 1 major power vs another.. as npsi (not purple shot it) literaly means shoot every1 not in your fleet. fleets from the same channel engage each other if they run into each other. so the idea of it turning into the new n3 vs goonies (add in grr goons comment as required) is *to be blunt* silly. it couldnt/shouldnt happen. that and there is nothing stopping another npsi group from starting up. in the last few months i know of 2 more that have started to great success alone.
1/26/2015,history repeats itself friendo. and to claim that npsi groups are somehow immune to the same politick that rules eve today by virtue of their rules of engagementis the height of folly
1/26/2015,"well no im not saying there is no politics in npsi *nor in your first statement did you even mention politics*.. but they are much simpler as you just engage everything. there are no blues. there are no reds.. you just kill anything you can thats not purple.its quite hard for 2 differant npsi groups to become the new ""goons vs n3"" as they can just attack any fleet they run into including other fleets from there own channel. im unsure of what point your trying to raise other than npsi has politics *regardless of how little*"
1/26/2015,you seem to think that npsi fleets are some ephemeral thing that doesn't play by the same rules as everyone else. even in its current form they are far from it and if this csm candidates ideas are put into practice then they add an entirely new layer of beauracracy and efficacy than they currently have.what im saying is if you add mechanics similar to the ones already in game what will keep what has already happened from happening again with more bullshit heaped on top?challenge mode: you can't use 'because we're npsi' as a reason
1/26/2015,"""you seem to think that npsi fleets are some ephemeral thing that doesn't play by the same rules as everyone else. "" well yes thats kind of the point. all the other rules that people play by aka ""im blue to you i wont kill you"" or ""my friends of my friends are your friends so we be bros yo"" do not affect npsi. if its not in fleet they fight it. thats all there is to it. its that simple. there is no huge meta game behind it, there is no drive for sov or moons. it is very literaly your in fleet and you kill what is not. ""what im saying is if you add mechanics similar to the ones already in game what will keep what has already happened from happening again with more bullshit heaped on top?""well whats to say that what ever new mechanic they bring out actualy ""god forbid"" fix's something. and we have been over that the idea of the current ""cold war"" with n3/goons would not/could not be with 2x npsi groups. and happily with the current way patchs are happening why not give it a go? if its ****, if it is crap they can just put there hands up and say ""oh **** sorry this is crap"" like they did with the indy teams. least they can try and see if maybe this is an idea that would work.also im not the op so putting to many questions to me is kinda pointless.challenge mode: you can't use 'because we're npsi' as a reason < and thats kinda pointless as the reply really is.. coz were npsi ;)"
1/26/2015,i'd vote for you simply because you make good vids and you show some fun wh stuff. check out my podcast! my blog!
1/26/2015,"i didn't vote for mynnna, i made a point not too. don't assume because of my corp or alliance that i voted one way or another. then again you seem to make a lot of assumptions, you assume that you can pass off your duties to other csm's because your ""not the biggest fan of wh small gang pvp"". the fact that you ignored an event because you didn't like a mechanic or a way its structured is the worst platform to stand on when it comes to representation. i assume you would attend such meetings and aim to change them for the better, not let them stagnate because you ""not a fan of small gang pvp in wormholes"". in a nutshell you admit to being centric in your focus, not accepting the responsibility to manage your representation of a community outside of already preferred aspects of the game and sidelining your supporters because ""i don't like wh's"".you continue to solidify my idea that you are a terrible representative and should never have been elected to the csm."
1/26/2015,"i agree, to assume that every csm can make time to fly out to iceland would be a hugely ignorant move. fortunately, thats not what i am referring too. he had the option of attending events during the winter csm meeting remotely, you can view his attendance here. his clear lack of commitment to the job when it comes to areas he deems uninteresting is what i have a problem with."
1/26/2015,"as a follow up, what are your personal thoughts on areas of interest that need a complete overhaul and what would you like for that specifically to be? (eg. making the career choice an immediate thing in the tutorial rather than later on or adding a pvp training zone in highsec starter systems etc.)"
1/26/2015,"see i have to be careful with this question because i actively now 'know' what ccp are planning to overhaul in the coming months. i say something which i know isn't slated to be on the table and i get egg on my face potentially or i say something i know is coming and it's grandstanding.what i will say is that as you saw from the minutes, the immediate npe - that first hour or so someone is in the game - is so super important and some of the ideas ccp showed us at summit are fantastic. i genuinely think that even more than sov update, this npe stuff is utterly vital to the long term health of the game."
1/26/2015,good duder running here!bring back the balance to eve#nohomo

1/27/2015,"that's it, you're going on my list, nao!guys, guys! chill out for a sec. you've both spent more than 2 seconds on your posts, and i submit that your points aren't so incompatible after all.orca can fit a cloak to cloak up in a safe spot when enemies come in system, but it loses a high slot for that. but if ganglinks are forced to on-grid only, then orcas will start going out into the belts. if an orca pilot is able to get safe from danger 90% of the time or more, that's still reasonable or else it wouldn't be profitable to bring the ship out in any but the most remote parts of space. all that remains is to balance the danger vs survivability such that orcas are getting sent out to the belts but are also getting shot down every once in a while.can't we just agree to agree?"
1/27/2015,"this thread looks like it could be rather interesting.oddly enough, the more people have told me how terrible i am, how i would be a bad csm and so forth without even putting forward a discussion, the more determined i have become to get votes.when i look at what they do say and who they support, it makes me more concerned for the future of csm and eve as a whole. thanks guys for motivating me to re-double my efforts."
1/27/2015,"i think there may have been one occasion, that i agreed with something you said. but what it was, escapes me now.i sincerely hope you do not win a seat. in my honest opinion, you have a toxic approach to many subjects and for that alone, it's a no vote from me.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
1/27/2015,"i think you misunderstand jen, i do plan on voting for some people one might consider to be my enemies. there are some carebears who's opinions and views i value. you are not one of them."
1/27/2015,"tora and sabriz aren't carebears and nor am i my signature is tongue in cheek.""themepark! themepark!"" yeah? absorb modules that are aimed mostly at making null sec blobs more tactical is carebear?"
1/27/2015,carebear is a state of mind.and you reek of it.
1/27/2015,i don't undertand your voting system. wouldn't the the group with the larger number of active voters put their candidate in? if say goons have 200 active vote ballots and high sec has 100 and they vote against eachc other goons would win by their numbers so how does that change anything
1/27/2015,"o/ borat - i just listened to the interview you provided the cap stable podcast. i find your ideas exciting, and as a solo player, i'm very much on board with getting some csm members that don't have ties to any one large player bloc.agreed. as the eve development cycle has quickened its pace, csm, too, needs to adapt. the csm term should be more than enough time to do significant work. critics of your opinion have suggested that the csm ""needs more time."" the excessive time some have been given is precisely what has allowed their self-congratulatory and priveleged inner core to develop in the first place.in an era of sometimes dangerously personal metagaming, i'm all for increased privacy measures for players.as i'm posting with an alt right now, as are you, i can't help but oppose your position here. i support the majority of your opinions, but i do wish you'd at least platform with the transparency you'd like to see put forward in-game. trust me, i don't care who your main is. i'm here because i like the way you think. learning that you have some @$$hole five year old account won't change that.be more specific. this is filler nonsense.~~~you'll have my vote."
1/27/2015,"many thanks for the answer. for me high sec's identity is a total clusterfeck and not something wholly defined by npcs. i didn't (and don't) expect you to change you mind about high sec; i was just trying to express some of my own frustrations about it's mechanics, how i see it harming eve's subscriber base, and find out if you could adapt to another play style."
1/27/2015,"defending against thieves is already something that can be done using roles. most thieves have to put in effort to get themselves into roles which allow them to steal, and as long a they have to put in effort, not just *join with noob, point and shoot orca - demand ransom* (which by the way, also doesn't show up on killboards) it's fine. keeping the current status quo where newbies aren't recruited as freely just to help the laziest of awoxers is a bad idea.and hey, genius, they aren't changing how corp thieves work, so it's not going to be ""a lot harder"" to catch them, it's going to be just as difficult as it ever was."
1/27/2015,"i'm sure those tutorials would be very good if you already know the mechanics. i'm not sure you could realistically turn those into something that new players would be able to read and take away any useful information from. the fact is fitting a ships is pretty complex when you're not fitting a gank catalyst.a skiff already has lower yield. picking a hulk would give you considerably more yield (something like 30% more), picking a mackinaw gives you a much bigger ore bay. the reason people use skiffs is that they are the only exhumer that keeps you relatively safe from ganking. so you fight for a group who complains about miners using the wrong tools for the job and blowing them up to show them the error of their ways, then you complain when people use the right tools for the job and demand they get nerfed?and fyi, using a hulk fleet with scouts is viable and used all the time in low and null, but you see considerably less of them in highsec as gankers can use alts too so it's difficult to scout out and incoming gank fleet. the few places in highsec they are used are places gankers wouldn't generally look. as stupid as it sounds, highsec is simply too dangerous to consider using high yield-paper tank in the majority of cases, regardless of the yield bonus. with the amount of precautions a corp would need to put in place to guarantee their safety long enough to earn the value of the fleet, they could work in null and earn considerably more."
1/27/2015,"i have mentioned and asnwered that question several times, also in forums, but ill try to show some things : i have been invited to both summit and fanfest, my rl makes it impossible to be on most meetings, therefor i listen to recordings and work from there. i am active on stage at eve amsterdam, think i got most forum and twitter in, as well within csm. with the minutes i ratehr dodge them with my writing, but no wurries, i do read them:)i think i am the guy with the a high eve twitter in csm, if thats relevant to the statistic dudes, also you could watch me at evesterdam, where i made a presentation this year, next on the list is fanfest and a eve meet in scandinavia this summer.i try to keep up with eve mail, which sometimes exceeds my ro work email, and ingame forums, also on the forums we share with ccp you can find alot of ideas and posts from me. besides that we use skype to communicate with alot of devs and eachother. i ll be making a eve24 about this summit, on which i invested a week of my time in iceland with pleasure:), spending 2 weeks in iceland of my own free time this year cuts into time with wife and kids, i am thankfull they support my passion.also ccp asked the csm to make a review of the year, which 7 of us wrote something for. issue is all of the above are just words, follow some links, talk to people that know me, and make your own judgement, and if thats not me, thats cool, 13 more members in the current csm u can like, and for the next election hopefully alot of engaged fresh blood"
1/27/2015,"i finally had the chance to meet core in person. he's dedicated, articulate, and passionate and he represents his constituency well. he's also an ultra-chill guy and is great to hang around with and just chat. don't let compliments from a goon count against him. core deserves to be back for csm x."
1/27/2015,sounds like core is so busy doing the job ...- rather than constantly proclaiming he is working.+1
1/27/2015,"the mauluses were simply an example of a useful ship that could be expedited for a new player to get into.giving access to ""nearly every t1"" module right off the bat would be problematic from a balance perspective. it would make groups that cater solely to new players, such as yours, have a larger mass of effective pilots. using the maulus example again, you would be capable of putting a brand new player into one of your groups maulus' a lot quicker. the ship, en masse, has proven to be very effective across numerous conflicts. if you were to buff the ability of a new player's ability to access specific modules, you would need to nerf the overall ability of those same modules so as to stem any abuse/gaming the function."
1/27/2015,"i think you're grossly overestimating how much time it takes to train into those in the first place. aside from specialized t1 modules like gas harvesters or bomb launchers or (perhaps) the cloaking device, i think it would only take 2-3 days to train all the skills necessary, which isn't that much of a difference... if you know which skill books to buy, which things are useful, which things aren't, etc. automatically giving those skills to a newbro wouldn't give newbro organizations a larger mass of useful pilots than they already have because we already get them with a bit of advice & investment in skill books.note: just realized that also lumped in t1 modules of more advanced weapons, like heavy launchers or large railguns, which was unintended. i meant the frigate-level versions of potential modules, like shield hardeners, smartbombs, weapon upgrades, etc. the goal is to let new players fit a variant of every potential build off the bat, rather than giving them a partial toolbox and forcing them to look up what skills they need for modules they're not even sure they need."
1/27/2015,"the point, which you seem to be missing, is that by making it so a new player has immediate access to all, or a large majority of, t1 modules you would have to rebalance them so as to stem any abuse of those modules en masse. that would affect suicide ganking catalysts, the maulus example, and so forth.as an aside, the question and follow up was directed towards endie, whose thread this is, and not you. if you feel like addressing the topic, do so in your own campaign thread.edit - i know it's bringing up the doxxing thing again but it relates to csm 10. in this capstable podcast discussion the topic of having the csm 10 candidates personal information remain private came up after ccp announced that will be the policy. do you agree with marc scaurus in that perhaps your personal information should be put out there in order to run for csm despite the current climate of people within gaming (in general) investigating your personal life, contacting your family and so forth or do you feel this shift in policy is better for those on the csm to prevent them from harassment?"
1/27/2015,"well.... i gotta agree with ash. i don't think you know how npsi works.like this doesn't even remotely make sense... npsi groups aren't just limited to pvp. how do you imagine this would become so perverted that only two social groups would exist, and they would be aligned against one another? there are multiple groups in existence presently, and there will be multiple groups in the future for the simple reason that they have different interests, and interact within the different activities of new eden."
1/27/2015,"that's pretty much what i was hoping you'd say, and i'm very much on board with that.it is kind of just things you could already have, but clubs could have additional things similar to what corps have - a shared calendar, a shared fitting pool, announcements, potentially a membership list. and yes, all of this could be made externally or worked around with the current system, but the general idea would be to make it as simple for a group to exist and organise content as possible. the more tools people are given to help them arrange this content, the more time they can spend actually doing it."
1/27/2015,"in this capstable podcast discussion the topic of having the csm 10 candidates personal information remain private came up after ccp announced that will be the policy. do you agree with marc scaurus, your former boss at themittani.com, in that your personal information should be put out there in order to run for csm despite the current climate of people within gaming (in general) investigating your personal life, contacting your family and so forth or do you feel this shift in policy is better for those on the csm to prevent them from harassment?"
1/27/2015,"it's just human nature, you can't deny that it's happened in new eden and in real world political situations.this isn't about how npsi works, it's about how people work in the political sphere whether its new eden or anywhere else."
1/27/2015,"then why aren't there only two incursion communities? why aren't there only two major pvp communities? what about the non-political entities that would benefit from these tools such as purely social groups like bsb et al? what about sirsqueebles' streaming community, eve-radio, or even the anti-ganking group?until you explain to me how all of these groups from all over new eden are going to devolve into a holy war similar to the cfc vs. n3 i'm going to continue thinking that what you're saying just doesn't make sense. hell, pvp communities make up a minority of the social groups that would benefit from these sort of changes."
1/27/2015,"i listened to that episode last night, and unless i'm mistaken marc was in favor of a system that only required you to reveal your real life identity if you were actually elected to the csm - just running for election wouldn't require you to disclose such information. i think this is the best of both worlds.for anything you do in eve, i don't think it's necessary for you to reveal your personal information. however, the csm is closer to an actual job than it is to an mmo, and the people who elect you have the right to expect a certain standard. i think that enforcing real life identities helps define this point, and increases the maturity of the council as a whole. if your job is literally to represent a group of individuals (virtual or otherwise) and you can't even trust them enough to tell them your name, then i don't know how you can be expected to do your job properly.is it a huge deal, or something that i would be up in arms about if they removed? no.would i prefer it stay the way it is currently? yes.my name is justin conroy, i'm a pilot for the rcaf, and i approve of this message."
1/27/2015,photos of jayne in spandex going for 1bil a pop.
1/27/2015,"that's an awesome photo, you can't deny it."
1/27/2015,"i fully agree with this sentiment. the fact that the identities of csm members were known reinforced that it's a serious undertaking, not just a player who's getting early access to info, helps reassure the players that the csm members are independent and objective. and like you say, if you can't trust the playerbase with your information, then how can you represent them?in addition to that, because this will only be coming in now, it creates a double standard. former and existing csm members who are running are known, while newer csm members will not necessarily be. while it shouldn't make a difference, i'm more likely to put my faith in somebody who i know is taking it that much more seriously than a random character name."
1/27/2015,this will be the first time i bother to vote :)you will get my vote friend.
1/27/2015,definitely voting for you. you have my laser!
1/27/2015,glad to have convinced you!
1/27/2015,"of all the csm candidates, i am probably the least experienced eve player. you could say i'm not a reykjavik insider! while i played a two-week trial in 2008, i couldn't figure out how to warp anywhere and uninstalled the game. when i came back this year, i immediately moved into nullsec exploration, where i learned all about navigating and surviving lawless space. during that time i was part of a small exploration corp for a short time, and then was taken in by friendly explorers in vale after i got lost one fateful evening.after learning a lot more about how eve worked, i decided i would head out on my own to further my covert ops career. i read up on a great deal of stealth bomber strategy, including the operations of both large groups (like bomber's bar) and solo play (by chessur) and ventured out into wormhole space to find targets of opportunity. i began my corporation, wingspan delivery services, and quickly accumulated applicants. these were returning players and people who were no longer interested in traditional corps with rigid structures and schedules. we worked together to get ""okay"" at wormhole scouting, navigation, reconnaissance, and mapping, and now we're one of the larger independent corps in eve!there are many dozens of hot topics in eve, and i don't want to waste your time -- are there any particular subjects you'd like to hear my thoughts on, other than the obvious ""when will we have an in-game mastery track for ship spinning?"""

1/27/2015,i definitely think that personal info should stay private. it was only yesterday when i last saw someone getting doxed while streaming eve and it's nothing i support at all. i am not the most private person online though and i guess that you could probably get my real life info pretty easily if you really wanted to harass me. i don't really see what benefit it would be that the csm members are public people or not. it's only bad imo.
1/27/2015,"well, let's just humor the concept you don't know what ccp are planning.what did you personally believe to be the biggest area of weakness for the npe as a whole prior to joining the csm?edit - on a side subject, in this capstable podcast discussion the topic of having the csm 10 candidates personal information remain private came up after ccp announced that will be the policy. as someone whose real name and such is already out there, what are your thoughts? do you agree with marc scaurus, a former contributor at your website crossingzebras, in that perhaps your personal information should be put out there in order to run for csm amidst the current gaming community's controversies? things such as investigating people's personal lives, harassing those peoples family members and so forth over video games."

1/27/2015,what are you going to do to make pi less of a chore
1/27/2015,"i think because it is very much passive income, the amount of effort currently involved is fine.there are a couple minor changes that i'd like to see done:- saving a planet layout so that a player can easily replicate it between planets (similar to saving ship fits)- sharing those layouts between playerspersonally, i would like to be able to put multiple command centers on a single planet while maintaining the current limit on the number of total command centers a player can have (e.g. option to have up to six on a single planet rather than just one each on six planets)."

1/28/2015,"there would be too many candidates to down vote them all using one coalition.i had code. join me in a channel today. quite a noisy bunch and people were resorting to convos but i will give due, they were rather polite. the funny part was, what they were saying, it almost sounded like this:thanks for the amusement guys."
1/28/2015,"with all the noise about high sec dunking, i thought gankers might want to show how hardcore they are."
1/28/2015,"wouldn't hurt to try a little harder to not sound like a carebear. when you're a highsec candidate, you already inherit a negative stigma, and people come to your platform looking to verify their fears and topple you. to rise above that, you have to go out of your way to convince them that they have you pegged wrong. now you can stick to your guns against the hordes of sheeple and declare that their prejudice is not your fault till the end of the world, but it will just leave you with about the same level of progress as xenuria. or, you can take a lesson from the popular highsec candidate mike azariah (#1 on my list {sabriz is #0}) and downplay your being a highsec candidate and instead focusing on inclusiveness and telling them what they want to hear. mike wants to be able to log in and mine and hang out with friends and chat, but he doesn't call himself a mining candidate. he hates gankers and wants em all to diaf but he listens to them and takes a glance from their standpoint. he includes them among his followers and seeks out ways to better their experience, too. after all, they are eve players and they have a vote, as well as every right to enjoy the game their way."
1/28/2015,"i have ganked. there was a guy who had a way of farming newbies, (not the usual bait cans and such) i won't repeat it because it is still possible. i was caught and really remembered it.six months later, i made a veteran friend and they bought us some pilots and plex to run them. between being in the alliance and repeating things said by them about each other and ganking their gate camps repeatedly we managed to tear the rotting corpse of maggots apart.i wouldn't be caught dead in a rl social situation with those guys.now this is a story all about howmy life got flip-turned upside - down,and i'd like to take a minute just sit right there,i'll tell you how i became the eccentric of an alliance called volt-airein west amarr, not born but raised, inhigh secwas where i spent someof my days,.....as a newbie, i got into a corp that was quite focused on mining. chillin' out, maxin' relaxin', around in a belt, chatting about politics, our lives, sharing youtube links, et cetera.it was very social. when a couple of guys, they were up to no good, started making trouble in the neighbourhood,someone had declared war on us. they did it knowing that we had no ships or skills to fight back so we had to hide and hide and hide. i think half of those original people are still hiding, bouncing from corp to corp and leaving as soon as a war is declared.however! some of us started training combat ships! <-- scary face.i do not remember if it was the first one or one of the subsequent ones but they didn't like it and dropped the war. not the soft target they expected. we started liking it and looked for corps the same size as us to declare war on.(i think at this point we made two corps, one for miners and one for fighters that could join under an alliance of the miners had war declared on them)i think my most exhilarating pvp was in 10 to 15 people vs about as many. solo fights i don't really care but with a gang you can see your impact in the battle.i would jump the gate first with a cyclone and break cloak first, be primary. then it was on!had to hold my tank long enough for my gang to break the primary of the other gang. over heat, cap boost, orbit around, trying to be close enough to be a threat at the same time.we had no logi. it was always a case of kill or be killed.my co saw one little worm holeand got excited and said, ""ya movin' wit ya corp mates to worm holesover there.""i begged and pleaded, with himday after day, but he packed his suitcase andtook himself away.i think he was in there for only a few months before he decide a c2 linked to high sec and c3s were not good enough and he wanted a c4 link. off he went to do it mostly solo while most of the ones that had moved to the first worm hole system left.i was mostly solo in a worm hole that was burnt out, war declare on it, the pos fuel was taken out of it, everything stolen and stranded for weeks without a good exit (how many times can it link to high sec island!?) full of loot, all my ships and you end up being very paranoid.it was there that i became very generalised. could solo everything in the class 2 with my cyclone, salvage, analyse, hack, mine (both ore and gas) started doing plantary interactions.then he wanted everyone in incursions. i stayed in the worm hole. then he wanted everyone to move to null security space as renters.i had a huge argument with him about how he was spreading us thin, everywhere and most of us didn't have enough sp to do most of the things he wanted done.i had already joined vc academy but i left hw and joined them again in a final parting. there was so much antagonism against me for standing up to him and being sensible, it was astounding.the alliance did implode in null sec and i am not surprised in the least. it was pretty much exactly as i said it would happen.spend some more time living in high sec while i was in vc academy, did it basically solo except for meeting up for some pvp operations and helping newbies.i had to take a break from eve (involving a hospital - totally fine now) i put my walk man on and said, ""i might as well kick it""first fleet, yo this is bad,drinkin' orange juice out of a champagne glass,is this what the people of volt-aire livin' like?hmmm... this might be alright.null seci lead some fleets, there is a standing fleet that we rotate fcs in. often fly logi in main fleets or in defense fleets scout and direct from a suicide bomber, so the things you see on my kill board are a drop in the ocean.loads and loads of organising. however, essentially, i would say i am mostly a worm hole / null sec player. i can understand and remember how horrible it was at times as a new player, especially the time i nearly quit. on the forums there is so much posturing and the most aggressive voices tend to be the loudest, so i end up arguing against them for the most part and landing up in the carebear seat.in fleets? ""jen, that is too evil,"" is said quite a lot."
1/28/2015,"i'm going to take that last line as a compliment.i'd be interested in discussing ideas about rewarding staying in a corp when it suffers setbacks/attacks etc, as i have some ideas that i think you might agree with. evemail me if you are interested in discussing them on skype or teamspeak, with a view to recording the conversation and releasing it. (i am au tz so there may be logistical challenges)."
1/28/2015,"congratulations, you don't need to run anymore! your argument is so powerful that ccp retroactively did this!any ship can fit a tank, any player can check the world map for recent killings, any ship can stay aligned, any player can watch local, join an intelligence channel, pre-pull concord, add known gankers to a watchlist.and despite all this, you can never be completely safe. and that's fine. if you seriously think it isn't, you are arguing that a fleet of 10 tackle frigates, 100 hacs, and 30 battleships shouldn't be able to destroy a tanked freighter, which is clearly bs. if you are arguing that it should take -more- ships than it -currently- does to destroy tanked ships, then no. that number has already been raised numerous times, and people who ask for 'just one more nerf' are followed by people who never knew what it was like before that nerf, and then ask for 'just one more nerf', and so on and so on. which is why highsec is so safe now. if you want to be safer, raise your ehp with modules, not by crying to ccp that it's too dangerous.or better yet, don't press the 'consent to pvp' button in the station. then you will be truly safe."
1/28/2015,"hi john! thank you for taking the time to communicate in my thread.if i recall correctly, and i do, when i wrote that bit i was thinking more about also having people having the chance to learn the tools... other than having a strange button on the screen... there was nothing telling me about what dscan was. i think i also missed the bit in the tutorial about checking the map for the killings...i don't recall asking for nerfs? did i do that? it's mostly about not having any way to learn those things, other than sitting down with google and getting a headache. of course, such things as bringing randomness into the response times of concord would be an interesting addition to the fight in high sec... a module that lets me destroy my ship and loot if i am not afk is something i would also find interesting. stuff like that. ""nerfing"" one group or the other is not going to change anything. that has already been proved time and again."
1/28/2015,"although the exact reason was never explicitly stated, anyone who was paying attention could easily infer as to why it occurred, and it wasn't for suicide ganking or in game griefing. are you advocating an escalation of banning for such behavior by ccp, especially in the wake of their announcement allowing the tactic of ""hyperdunking"""
1/28/2015,"hi ashterothi!thank you for taking the time away from your own campaign thread in order to visit mine!no, i am not advocating an escalation of banning.suicide ganking is not griefing. i am not advocating a policy change here... just maybe some more clarity/transparency for the bans that take place. if you have the energy, i think i talked about this on my capstable interview!"

1/28/2015,"as a fellow aussie i'm sure you're aware of our daily ritual of getting kicked off the server. would you consider approaching ccp to have downtime moved back by a few hours so that it falls in china primetime, thus not effecting as many people on tranq?"
1/28/2015,"my main worry is at 3 to 4 days you probably dont know enough about eve to do wh's, i'd worry people that new go in die horribly and think think wtf and quit.having a later set of tutorials maybe a few weeks in could be a option though."
1/28/2015,an advanced player tutorial could really be something special. it could target players who have been playing anywhere from a month to a year and offer introductions to advanced gameplay methods that many of us never get into due to not understanding how to start.

1/28/2015,"o7i hope, like you do, that the csm x can have independant voices, like myself. the reason i am running with my public alt is a full part of my program, and if i am elected it will be a clear sign to ccp that players' alts ough to become public knowledge. as i already said, i will be the first one to publish my other alts if this becomes a reality for all players.keeping alt anonymous is a huge advantage to super rich players that can afford many accounts (i am not talking about a handful of accounts, but many more), and can use those to easily infiltrate multiple groups, or plan cloaky afk and paralyse systems, or other more subtle ways of influencing the game.these players use an influence that is mainly driven by the isk or real life money they have access to. at least, knowing about all their alt is a way of understanding the influence they can weigh around.for my own campaign, what would the transparancy really achieve to convince you more? why would you want my alts to become potential targets to those that do not like my public positions?what about if i had acquired my main alt on the character bazaaar? what would that tell you more about myself?frankly, you are better off judging me on the ideas i express here, until a real effort to remove anonimity on alts for all players is undertaken by ccp, new players could learn to fly new ships in full isolation from other players, until they understand the specificity of the ship, and its role, and choose to undock and explore new eden. i am not favorable to have noobs only starting zone, like other mmo have, but i would like to see a ship simulator training that could be used from within your starting station, without having to have to undock. it would allow any new player to try out any ship and some fiitting variations and choices by taking a ride into a single instance that cannot be accessed by any other player, without spending money or even skill training. the simulator would pit the player against some pve particularly adapted to demonstrate the capacity of the chosen ship, and the mission repeatable until its succesful completion, and could then unlock the next category of ships to train from. this simulator would be always available from the starting station of the player, even for the end game ships. many players use the test server to that effect, but it would be better if it was a part of live server experience, even if the instances in that case could be run on a different server. this is just an idea for the ship/pvp/missioning training, but there are so many more things to do for new players to be taught the different aspects of the games, in the order they themselves chose.another important aspect is to not have negative effect like status loss without having been fully trained on the consequences of the actions undertaken.there are a lot of discussions to be had around new players' training, and there is no silver bullet for it. there are just a few bases that represent my train of thoughts on the subject."
1/28/2015,"recorded a show together with mike azariah, i am editing it now so expect another great interview with mike, regarding his csm campaign and some other random eve stuff.i'll post it when it's downloadable."
1/28/2015,our latest episode of the legacy of a capsuleer podcast is out:
1/28/2015,i look forward to working with you ;-)
1/28/2015,"i'm well aware that skiffs have a yield slightly less than that of mackinaws and hulks, but the gap was closed considerably with a recent patch. a hulk fleet in a deadend system with scouts on the entrance gate (and, if desired, any wormholes) would provide ample warning of incoming gankers in high just as it provides warning of hostiles in null. the only real way gankers will get you then is a logon trap, which is more effort than it's worth, or a lapse in your scout's concentration. it still doesn't make sense to do so in general because hulk yield isn't high enough to be able to pay the scout.on the idea of fitting tutorials for new players - advanced fitting is indeed complex and there's a million and one exceptions to every rule. however, basic fitting strategies (don't mix tanks, don't mix active and buffer tanks, don't mix guns, carry a way to apply damage to small ships, fit weapons systems that your hull is bonused for and fit modules to enhance them, favor sustainable local repair in pve, burst local repair in solo pvp, buffer in medium gang or fleet pvp) - all of these can be taught as rules that the intermediate player follows verbatim (and the veteran can break from time to time)."
1/28/2015,"supposedly it wasn't losed that much as according the the game right now a max yield hulk is 30% more yield than a skiff. a skiff and a mackinaw are level pegging as neither of them has yield as a primary design feature..i just don;t think people will get it. you understand it because you'e played the game for eternity. if you told a newbie not to mix tanks though he'd have no idea what you are talking about. i learned by doing. i lost many a terrible fit battleship to npcs and i lost a few ships venturing into lowsec, a couple of mining iterons (lol) to can bait, etc. knowledge gradually and naturally increased. while ganking existed, i never saw it happen near me an never encountered it. i think if everything was shoved in my face in day one, then i was thrown into an environment where nothing i flew was safe and people were just getting blown up and trolled in local, i'd probably have not bothered sticking around. i'm all for teaching newbies to look after themselves, but i think you have to accept that they aren't going to just get it because you've told them, and they need to be given a good bit of breathing room to adjust to eve as it's different from many other games. once they are in and adapted, go nuts."
1/28/2015,"before anyone asks... look at the multiple civilian shield booster kills.note: this is in referrence to the number of the mods as well as the kms. and yes, all parties involved assisted the player on to improve their eve experience by talking to them on a one on one basis and explain why said fit was bad. they had never learned it from the intro, and now they know better. the terminal end of the digestive system."
1/28/2015,"serious question:you often make the claim that highsec is not supposed to be the early game, when compared to low, null and wormhole space and isn't something you grow out of, it's a section of space in it's own right. at the same time however you state that high level pve should be nerfed in highsec and put into lowsec more - like moving l4 missions into lowsec for example.so why is it you think that for pve, highsec should just be a starter area, while for pvp it should be the full game? surely if highsec is a whole game area, it should cater to all levels of play for both pve and pvp, thus things such as level 5 missions should occur fully in highsec too. or if pve players are supposed to move on to higher levels of pve outside of highsec, that pvp players should have to move on too."
1/28/2015,"when did i say corp thieving was changing? that's not something i said man. i said catching a corp thief in general is harder, always has been. what i was saying, if you had listened, was that many of the people who currently do ""lazy"" (as you call it) awoxing will have to adapt and some may chose to become corp thieves. and you're correct, if they chose to ransom and honor said ransom then yes they are much harder to catch. i myself followed that approach (hilariously i did not change my bio while awoxing). my point was that the corps that were falling for awoxing are typically going to be the same ones who will fall for corp thieves. these are generally corps that have awful recruitment standards (re: my bio) and are not particularly a positive contribution to the game society. as for the change, i understand ccp's reason for removing it, and i think their intention is noble and their hearts in the right place, i just don't think that the change is actually going to accomplish what they claim it is."
1/28/2015,"risk vs. reward. simple as that. personally though, i'm not really all that worried about high sec lvl 4's myself. i don't disagree with sabriz on this, i just am not as concerned about it. high sec incursions on the other hand..."
1/28/2015,"i am in favor of level 5 missions being added (technically returned) to highsec, but with *very* careful balancing of rewards. they can (if done right) be a source of conflict in highsec.they should serve as optional fleet content, not as something that is the clear best way to grind isk."
1/28/2015,"you're assuming that highsec's current level of individual pve income generation is balanced in the first place.it's not. highsec breaks risk vs reward on a fundamental basis, with it's pve ""content"" being both safer and more lucrative than almost anything else. one of those things need to be dealt with. personally i'd like to see both of them adjust downward slightly, rather than simply slashing mission and incursion income drastically to match how safe it is to do those things.pvp belongs everywhere in eve online. pve does as well, but since there is a distinct mechanical benefit to pve activity, (whereas pvp depends on the loot fairy in equal measure regardless of what sec status you are in), it must be balanced accordingly."
1/28/2015,"as a loyal provident, i'm wondering the same thing; i haven't seen much contribution from you in the minutes that have been released."
1/28/2015,"+1 the fresh blood of the game is easily overwhelmed, brave have done an excellent job of showing new players the ropes and encouraging them to help each other out. there are still a lot of things to consider about how new players are treated however."
1/28/2015,"i didn't get involved in that discussion because, while i sympathise with dave's idea about starting the character off with sufficient skills for t1 ships, i'd prefer ccp procedurally granted individual skills in the course of the tutorial, pointing it out and saying ""now you can use this module, now lets do that in your next mission"". this grants a feeling of ""earning it""; it means that it is not instant; and it means that the player has to do the tutorial to get these small-but-important boosts to new player ability, which will hopefully aid retention.that said, dave's idea would not be a huge issue, and i don't believe that the perennial bittervet fear of being swamped with newbies in mauluses is justified: for most of the history of the game, players started off with about 750,000 skill points, and could be in, for instance, a t1 ewar cruiser in a matter of hours if they chose the right starting build. the game did not collapse.regarding the capstable discussion of csm players' real identities, it is not relevant: ccp have decided to drop the need to publicise real identities and i welcome that (although my own name and information is easily found out and has been circulated in the past, and another senior member of goonswarm suffered a swatting attempt in the past couple of weeks). i heard nothing at all in that podcast that even began to form any valid ""public interest"" in the irl identities of individuals that run for the csm and, short of ensuring that charles manson or abubakar shekau cannot stand, i cannot imagine one, either."
1/28/2015,this is amazing coming from the guy who told me to stop asking about why jayne was on the goon's csm ballot. by independent you mean their goals align with yours. even in-game mailed me about it!
1/28/2015,"well, after actually reading the whole tread (took a damn while, like 2-3 hours) i find that jayne (i've flown with him a few times too with him as fc, aka i am kossen jaikka) and i think that yes he will do a awesome job to be a csm. unfortunatly there is a lot of hate going on about in-game actions that had nothing to do with a csm campaign, but here is the nature of eve.anyway, i hope that he gets there and will sure be on my vote."
1/28/2015,"well i can respect the sentiment but ""going off of ingame actions"" is kind of the best thing we have. certain csms get elected based on their actions in wormhole space, or the economic or industrial side of things. what else would you base it off of? high school grades? field and track records?"
1/28/2015,"ever thought about the risks it could bring to them ? not everyone has a job at the supermarket, where it's 'pretty safe' to give out personal info. some people are taking a huge risk if they would have to make real life info public. does that mean they cant be a csm x ? lucky for them leeloo already said you dont have to do so anymore (just to ccp)."
1/28/2015,"as stated above, if you can't trust the group you are supposed to be representing, then how can you expect them to have faith in you. and i don't believe there's any job where you're going to make yourself suddenly unsafe if your name goes onto the internet. besides, you're more likely to run into issues if you're super secretive. you'll probably get doxxed and end up with the contents of your email and your full personal information plastered all over the internet.edit: oh and yes, if your personal life is so dangerous that just your name being out on the internet (which it no doubt already is) would somehow endanger you, then you have too many other things to worry about to be a useful member of the csm."
1/28/2015,"i agree with one aspect of the campaign, and that means goals align with mine? (that's not to say they don;t, i just haven't considered the rest of the campaign much yet).also, i'm not a goon. in fact ask the goons and 99% of them hate me, like with a passion. i'm honestly surprised i haven't been forcefully purged yet.as for the in-game mail, i sent you that in the hope that you'd stop shitting up people's csm threads with tears about your corp being terrible."
1/28/2015,"it seems like some of the posts here are made to settle personal, in-game vendettas, while for as far as i can tell, the csm topics should really be about the csm campaigns, and the topics the candidates propose. i've read though most of the csm candidates topics now and i do notice some people really focussing on the in-game aspects, and alot of rumours are being spewed. a lot of these so-called ""questions"" are very repetitive and give me the feeling people are just trolling, or trying to discredit the candidates, for reasons that are unknown to me.no matter the past you had with these candidates, it shows a certain amount of immaturity and disrespect.i do see a lot of possibilities in these social club things, and i think giving a sort of structure to it might benefit all of the people who use them. one of the issues i do notice now is the massive amount of things new people have to set up before they are able to fully appreciate the npsi stuff, i'm subscribed to a load of mailinglists, have loads of chattabs open, and so on and so on. it would be a wonderful improvement to be able to take a peek in my calendar, and see if fleets are up, or to just be able to search for recommended fits through the fittings screen or by opening some sort of bulletin board. and yes, everything is doable by the current mechanics, but sometimes simplification enhances the playability of a game. anyways, you've got my vote, and if you win a seat, i do hope you'll find the time to pvp a little.ps : die a little more, still havent got your corpse !"
1/28/2015,and my cap stable interview is now up
1/28/2015,"greetings capsuleers! i am ashterothi, and i would like to represent you as a member of the council of stellar management.a little about me:i have been playing eve since 2010. during that time i have lived in null sec, been a mission runner in high sec, and fought for the gallente in faction warfare as coo of aideron robotics. i have also been a standing host for two podcasts and attended a few meetups. i currently run a wormhole corp that is taking the first steps into the great beyond.i love the variety of activities in eve online; i have made isk from ratting, mission running, tag collecting, pi, exploration, faction warfare and incursions. my goal for the last few years has been understanding of eve from a holistic point of view. i am eager to learn, teach, and help things grow. the eve online community is amazing and i love to give back to it. i am a host of the high drag podcast which focuses on the new player and small gang lifestyles, as well as hydrostatic podcast which is more focused on eve mechanics and lore with some of the biggest experts in eve. a few years back i also wrote for the mittani.com, focusing on analysis and faction warfare. i am also the guy who made the tweetfleet slack.in my real life i am a software engineer working primarily on android applications. so what do i bring to the csm?first of all, i am a strong advocate for revisiting and expanding exploration content in the game. i am an explorer and a scout at heart, so seeing more, better, and more challenging exploration content is key to my eve experience. large parts of this are the hacking and scanning minigames, which have both received some love recently but not enough, as hacking remains a 20% project for one or two passionate devs and scanning has only gotten minor updates in the last six months. eve<U+FFFD>s other minigame, planetary interaction, is in an even worse state, and while it<U+FFFD>s not necessarily exploration-related, i<U+FFFD>d advocate for a substantial update there as well.secondly, i am fascinated by the lore of eve online, and its potential. one of the most rewarding things from being part of the hydrostatic podcast was the lore panel that i participated in . recent events like caroline<U+FFFD>s star have shown people are very interested in watching the lore unfold. if i had my way, the devs and other members of ccp who love the lore would be encouraged and enabled to continue to do awesome things. the development of the lore, and its manifestation in the game should be an important part of eve<U+FFFD>s development, and i plan to support that from within the csm.additionally, the importance of having a successful, fun, and engaging new player experience cannot be overstated. one of my early money making activities was recruiting people into eve online, which has allowed me to experience a lot of the issues that new players struggle with. while many people enjoy the fact that they can kill someone who yet to learn the nuances of the rules that govern the game, i prefer my prey a bit more advanced. it is important that everyone who comes to try eve are given the tools to be successful. failure is an important aspect of the game, and shouldn<U+FFFD>t be prevented. however success and failure should come from informed decisions and counter-play, as opposed to encyclopedic knowledge of confusing mechanics. if i am playing chess with someone, i will make sure they understand the rules fully before i crush them. these issues represent only a fraction of what i could offer as your csm. however, i prefer to let my actions and words speak for themselves. as a member of the csm, i would work hard to communicate with you to ensure not only that i am representing you properly, but that you know what i am presenting to ccp. i also staunchly defend all of the aspects of eve online's gameplay, even those that i have not engaged in, or am not engaged in now. if i am elected i will do my best to represent the playerbase and actively pursue the best course of action for my constituents, and the health of the game. here are some samples of my previous works:"
1/28/2015,space reserved for blogs and further comments.an in-depth view of a possible alternative new player experience
1/28/2015,good candidate.
1/28/2015,"i am pleased that i will have a lore friendly option available to me on my csm ballot, but i am curious if you could expand on what exactly you would like to see ccp do regarding lore. more chronicles? more player events? a project similar to a-j?a few other questions:1) in terms of developing the hacking mechanic, what options would you like to see considered by ccp?2) do you have any opinions about the future sov changes that are expected in the next year or so?i look forward to also hearing a cap stable interview with you, as i am sure they are just about to invite you"
1/28/2015,"hi there!you talk a lot about lore in your op, but i see no mention of roleplaying. is this something that you think ccp should promote, or is it a fringe playstyle that doesn't require developer attention? as a tie in to that question, when ccp organizes a live event, do you prefer well scripted ideas that follow the lore, or open ended scenarios that evolve based on player actions? should player actors be involved in these events?thanks in advance, and good luck."
1/28/2015,"i have three goals with lore:1) the lore has had plenty of false starts in the past, however right now the energy is very pro-lore development. i feel we need a voice on the csm to continue to promote this, so it doesn't end up like previous attempts. we need to send a clear message to ccp that development of the science fiction narrative is very important to us as players.2) i would like to see more fusion of player lore and ccp lore. player events making the real news, and allowing players to contribute to the unfolding lore such as the champions from the amarr succession.3) increase the integration with the lore into the game, so that we don't need giant lore panels to explain the monolithic amount of chronicles that already exist. as far as the hacking mechanic, i think it is can be viewed as a good example of what sorts of things we can do with eve interfaces. however, i do not feel it hit the goal of feeling like a ""rogue like"" game. perhaps additional ""events"" that can come up, increase challenge so winning isn't assured for high skilled players, and increasing reward to compensate. sov is something that i experienced, but i must admit that i am not as versed as some others who are running. i think that my place in that discussion is to help augment ideas, and provide a critical thinking test, as opposed to proposing my own solution such as i have done with the npe. that being said. i think cities grow up more then out, and some of my ideas of what sov could be can be found in my post about pos changes, which admittedly is old now."
1/28/2015,"as i stated above, i think the lore of eve is very rich, but is still somewhat separated from the in-game experience. ccp seagull has spoken about giving ""enablers"" tools in which to better create cool things.rpers have already done amazing things without many mechanical tools in the game. however, a more integrated lore, and a better sense that their action as rpers impact the lore, as it did with the sansha events, will naturally promote more rp activity in eve. if members of the rp community came to me with something that would better enable them, i would of course highlight those to ccp. for example morwen has spoken about the need for tweaks in the in-game rp channels and systems, and the new ""communities"" concept should be tooled to solve many of those problems."
1/28/2015,[thread excitment intensifies]woot woot! you can count on my vote.
1/28/2015,my name is bhock and i am one of the contributor of the capstable podcast.in early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10.here is our announcement:
1/28/2015,i think ashterothi would be good for csmx.
1/28/2015,"how many live events did you take part beside the battle for caldari prime and that one in null...by ""player actors"" you mean dev actors, without tham there is no live event realy.events should be ""scripted "" in a way that the event should have at least two or more different endings, that may lead to a new event related to his one and the story develops. but then again it has been realy long time from last event... now we get mostly few news articles"
1/28/2015,"first off to double back, i prefer a variety of in game events, from scripted, free flowing, and even ccp supporting fan events. an example of the third one was the first nightmare in new eden. although not a lot of people showed up, a ccp actor playing as a sansha invasion did (it was during the events leading up to incursions).the best lore that has come out of ccp has been when players can impact the results, and even when ccp themselves don't know exactly how things will shape up, only what their goals are for whatever mechanics it will tie into. a really good example is the research race we just had. in it the mechanical outcome was assured, but the players set the details, even to the extend of expanding the story beyond even what ccp expected.the best stories are collaborative. ccp seagull stated she has a long background with table top rpgs and larping, and with that in mind ccp should work to set the stage, and then highlight players reactions to weave a ongoing story.my dream would be to someday read the novel about the journey towards player owned stargates, starting from rubicon, and working its way towards the end. the players impact how the story twists and turns, and what exactly happens, but the universe and ""npc"" actors within the story are of course part of ccp's design to influence events to ensure it doesn't go off the rails. as far as how many live events i have personally taken part in, i have actively been present for a few of the sansha invasion events, participated in the one leading towards ghost sites (and criticized it for its execution), and i would like to think of my work with the lore panels as participating in the current ongoing events.edit:for more information about the sansha events, and live events in general:"
1/28/2015,"unless i'm mistaken, ccp has previously given active roleplayers in the community control of one on the ships in a live event."
1/28/2015,"while i cannot vouch for this exactly, i know of a couple of examples were player actions have been augmented by ccp to provide continuation of the story."
1/28/2015,"lore, exploration, and broad experience?you have my vote."
1/28/2015,"hello,i<U+FFFD>m migui x<U+FFFD>hyrrn or how everyone else calls me, migui (yeah don<U+FFFD>t try to pronounce my last name and i happen to own the character named <U+FFFD>migui<U+FFFD>). i<U+FFFD>m a 30 years old physicist from spain and i have been playing since summer 2011, with incarna.i joined nullsec early on my career and starting getting involved with in-alliance business, organization and leadership for test alliance please ignore and as such, i<U+FFFD>m currently test head diplomat and financial director.my activities in game have been primarily economically-based, i grow a lot of isk by trading in highsec and nullsec and ended spending a good chunk of it in an avatar class ship to help my alliance with logistics.i forged my own way in eve and i have been trying since then to help my community, mainly the spanish speaking people in help channels and such. i own a spanish fansite ("
1/28/2015,"bring battlecruisers and battleships into the game again2014 has been the year of ishtars and assorted t3<U+FFFD>s, mainly because the warp changes made it unfun to roam around in battlecruisers or larger and the medium micro jump drives never solved anything.battleships simply die too easily to bombs, so we are now stuck with a couple of valid and overused ships to fly for our doctrines that are putting us back to the days before the tiericide. ishtars need to be nerfed. you are a fast t2 cruiser, with big resists and little risk of dying if you aren<U+FFFD>t messing around. drones can be bombed out of the field, but they are very effective to the point that other doctrines have been built to specifically be anti-ishtar fleets.some people may argue that battlecruisers aren<U+FFFD>t broken because one fit in particular is effective, or that they are meant to be used in this way. i would love to go back to 2012 where nagas were amazing to fly around, you would stumble upon talos gangs, tornados were all around camping gates, and so on. they were overpowered? well, maybe the other alternatives weren<U+FFFD>t good either.battleships stopped being the amazing ships they were. its like post 1945 era, when torpedo delivering and bomb diving aircraft outdated the battleships. so we either find a way to make battleships less prone to die horribly or simply nerf how good bombs are in terms of effectiveness versus risk. i won<U+FFFD>t nerf bombs or covert ops to the ground because they are very fun ships to fly and we need them around. we will find a way to use them effectively in game and being op without making the rest of the bigger ships utterly useless. but i do think that for every mechanic you can take advantage of, there should be a counter.make eve online a more dynamic world, with less bot-like activitiesmining, missions, and marketing. what do all these things have in common? they can be done mindlessly in a few steps until the end of days.i am not against miners or anything, i would like to make their game a bit more fun. i<U+FFFD>ve found that many miners improve their game to not play the game. they set up everything to alt-tab to netflix and such. mining could become as profitable as ninja-gas mining in wormholes if there was a bit of spice added to the equation.basically i would like to see bots out of eve, and while this is very difficult to achieve, making certain activities less based in repeating stuff over and over and over could help to fix this while you improve the overall gaming experience.economy overhaul for alliances from the linemember to coalition warfareone of my concerns as an alliance director is that my people are happy and have money. because unhappy and poor people are less prone to fly better ships and without better ships you can<U+FFFD>t accomplish strategic objectives because you are outgamed in no time.i find that eve is way too poor in this particular aspect. alliances have little margin to make money: you either have moons or renters. and all these resources are already taken and/or depend on where you live.i was there when we discussed and then signed the agreement about occupancy based sov so i pretty much agree with it. i want to think like space is a living place that rewards you for taking care of it. so i am going to propose to get rid of the old true security system that determines the number of spawns of anomalies and the quality of ores that you find in belts. also, i want to have moongoo evenly spread through nullsec and lowsec, so that it is very unlikely for a group of players to control the market over certain item but also to help in local t2 production, because alchemy alone cannot cope with the demands if you plan to invest heavily into this.we can talk about low-end bottleneck and such, but i think industry in 0.0/lowsec needs to be watched carefully before jumping into conclusions (dat ice compression). i am aware of a number of problems related with this.eve has become a larger place since phoebe, but we still depend a lot in highsec logistics because there are a number of bottlenecks that prevent us from making prosper states.by getting rid of true security i would tie the quality of anomalies to other things. for example, sov indexes and occupancy. lets say, the more you use the space the better it becomes. the more people you have within a constellation, the better the anomalies, chances of officer spawns, etc. even more, true security could be tied to this activity so it would fluctuate with time, within certain values.we could tie this to the lore: <U+FFFD>hey, we are pirates trying to make a living here and this motherf* comes to murder us like all the time, lets counter-attack them!<U+FFFD>this way, we would get rid of <U+FFFD>ha, you live in that ****** region no one wants, and i<U+FFFD>m sitting here piling up isk<U+FFFD>. this could even out the things a lot for alliances that haven<U+FFFD>t been there for years and have everything already figured out.i don<U+FFFD>t want to take anything from anyone<U+FFFD>s hands because i<U+FFFD>m pretty sure everyone worked hard to get them. i want to even out the things by helping those that don<U+FFFD>t have that option.we might be able to set up alliance level taxes for some stuff. i am not a fan of milking our people but maybe a little tax could help the finances, specifically if you are starting over after losing a big war or something like that :)(continues)"
1/28/2015,"lowsec is life, lowsec is loveoutside factional warfare and a handful of systems that happen to be active because of their location, lowsec is mostly empty. and it is empty because there is no reason to stay there, you get better things in nullsec or you get safer things and arguably better in highsec.lowsec needs a purpose in eve online. probably moving all lvl4<U+FFFD>s would be way too extreme, but what about creating new fun content for lowsec, as a new kind of missions tied to the lore or anomalies that only exist there and that are actually worth it to run.overhaul of corporation and alliance management, just some little annoying thingsroles, shares, kicking inactive people, etc. if you have experience with the corporation management tab and/or alliance, i feel your pain. this needs a serious rework. i want to be able to activate a <U+FFFD>kick if inactive after x months<U+FFFD> maybe unless that guy has some particular role to prevent deceased members or other special cases being kicked. i<U+FFFD>m sure that huge corps will like this.shares are the key either to evict your ceo or to save your corp if your ceo is in jail. either way, in a game where trust is that important, shares are too powerful.better standings management. i want to have the possibility to define better what +2.5 means and what +5.0 gets you and the same thing for -5.0 or -10.0. and possibly the notification of standing changes towards your corp or alliance.station management needs to improve.integration between different cultures/languageseve online has a ton of people from all around the world. as a spaniard, i have found that not having a version for my fellow latin american and spaniard friends is a big wall in front of them to try out the game and play it. many of them like the idea but can<U+FFFD>t get involved because of language barriers.i am perfectly aware that translating the game is a long term investment for the company and it is not a straight decision to take if numbers aren<U+FFFD>t good, based on promises.i would like to get rid of this problem by tying (at least some of) the character strings to a local file or maybe an overview-like file stored in the server. and then, having the possibility of submitting translations. this could be managed by a subversion or something like that, where people proposes the translation, gets voted and ends being submitted for a final preview.this way we would get quality translations for free, the company would get rid of legal issues that might arise with the translation, and we would bring the game to anyone around the globe that wants to join the fun.i would like to see the old language channels come back because we miss them.sov revamp, legacy code aka poses and suchif ccp seagull<U+FFFD>s roadmap is accurate we will be getting more info about ccp plans at fanfest 2015. as i said before, i signed the occupancy-sov proposal so there is that. i do like the <U+FFFD>el digin<U+FFFD>s solution<U+FFFD> back in a few months ago.well i have more ideas but this is a draft. you may ask me anything you would like to know. thanks for reading.also i will be doing an ama in r/evedreddit."

1/29/2015,"ccp says a lot of things and doesn't deliver. frustrating, but they aren't going to change."
1/29/2015,"dear ccp, dear csm,after reading 4 days minutes, i want first to thank you all for this work.there is a lot of very accurate informations about eve but also about ccp's life.some opinions :1) what about displaying specific windows for targets ? easier to watch in the same time a ship near you and a np pirate when you are mining for example.2) even if it's not csm purpose, we understand that eve online main changes in the future depend on legion and valkyrie interactivity with eve. how can we do so that eve players could make know what they would like for legion and valkyrie in a eve player spirit ? i propose to open also specific sessions in summit for legion and valkyrie.3) about wis, nothing. well, i hope that some csm members are fighting so that it could keep on. because it's also a change much more visible than a graphic detail for example.4) csm member activity. he must be active with ccp, that's ok. but, in fact, we don't really see it. what is important for players is how active is the csm member with players. as an example, even if mike is remote for summit (and for very good personal reasons i'm sure), he is very active to answer and give visibility as much as he can on game evolutions.5) csm is a very good concept. it must be developed. ccp and csm must take in account players opinions. and not only veterans opinions who sometimes forget what can be other games. i am new in eve but i played video games already that your moms did not plan yet to wipe clean you the bottom for most of you. eve will live ten years more if there will be again big ""woooo"". they are not in some unrelevant module changes.best regards and thanks again."
1/29/2015,"no it's not, but that's the point. it forces you to either man up and fight back, turtle up and not do much unless it's safe, wimp out and leave the corp for the duration of the war, or hire some mercs to fight on your behalf. that's the whole point of wardecs....to force you into action. the merits of what action you take can be debated but the point is to force a reaction.anywhere is the place for pvp as is being aptly demonstrated by the gankers and wardec corps. high sec isn't safe...it was never designed to be safe...and you should definitely not think of it as such.high sec is also not supposed to be a themepark. it's just as dangerous as low or null...actually probably more dangerous since people always seem to have a false sense of security while in it. nothing needs fixing....as far as a majority of the playerbase and most of the devs are concerned its working as intented.read the falcon quote and htfu"
1/29/2015,"what do folks think of being able to customize brackets themselves to change color to represent if they were over, within, or under your current weapons optimal. perhaps as a right click option to the specific weapon system so you could even do it with various high and mid slot ewar.right click > use as bracket/overview filter > glorious colors."
1/29/2015,"one person's take on why people quit eve.the commentary is pretty slow and dreary, so i will give you the highlights of the complaints:1) difference in skill points between veterans and newbies2) they want to get into a capital ship and wipe out whole gangs and fleets solo.3) eve is a harsh game translates to ccp developers do not care about their players.4) there is not enough spoon feeding of new players and leading them by the nose, telling them what to do next.5) eve is too slow and boring.6) their favourite ship, which they are emotionally attached to is lost.7) fitting takes too long.8) lose their battleship and all their isk1) as he says, he puts most of his skills into pve. personally, i have so few skill points that anyone who focuses on missions and incursions will over take me in a year. you do not need a lot of skill points. you need a good fit for a ship that falls within that skill limitation and your budget.2) welcome to the entitled immediate gratification generation. need i say more or can i just ask them to try eve again when they have grown up a bit?3) i feel ccp is a mixed bag of people just doing their jobs but by and large they are passionate about their work. there is also a thin like that they walk; one hand they can be considered too but on the other people can think they have gone too carebear and are turning eve into a theme park. 4) newbie free for all, for a day in a seperate sector of space / tutorial area? virtual worlds to have the freedom that you do not have in real life? 5) eve is not a first person space shooter. it is a tactical and strategic (maybe a tactical and political) game. there is so very much to do, you just have to figure out all the stuff. i have so many things to do right now regarding eve that i don't make much in the way of isk at all. talk to people! get involved in things! this is not designed to be a solo game. if you make it into a solo game of you versus and asteroid or the rats in the same missions; then obviously you will become bored!6) salvage the old ship if you can and build some of the next one from that. continue the generations. i give my ships roman numerals to see what version of one i am on.7) we could do with a replicate option. buy multiple fits into one giant container, set one up then sourcing from there drag the fit onto other ships that are the same. a bit like how blue prints work, checking that you have all the bits and pieces.8) similar to 2) they want to get into a bigger and what they believe is a safer ship. please ccp add some tank and weapon requirements. 8 days to sit in a battleship is really bad for the game.one comment that stood out, ""every other game is based on wow except for eve,"" i am not sure if the cracking sound was my skull or my desk. how are people believing that?"

1/29/2015,"*shrugs* i don't expect to win a seat. at this point, this thread is turning into a pseudo blog.edit: when you attempt to lecture me and actually believe i will care, at least attempt to write in a coherent fashion."
1/29/2015,original post updated.... and shutting down the forums for the day. too much yammering and not enough playing lately.

1/29/2015,"what a bunch of crap.if this makes the csm, it shows how bad people are at making choices.-infinity"
1/29/2015,"your story is surprisingly similar to mine! i also watched my original corpmates run and hide when we got into a war. i had intended to troll them with evasive mining ships (we were a mining corp) and ride it out, but two things disappointed me:1.) i never saw a war target, despite spending a considerable amount of time in our known home system2.) the corp evaporated and i had to leave as the ceo was repurposing the skeleton for other thingsi got into wormhole space a couple of times and also used a cyclone for its versatility, though i mostly went that path because i love versatile ships. i made a masterpiece swiss army ship out of a myrmidon to which ossian boone, a corpmate, said the memorable quote which now sits in my bio. that ship was lost on its maiden voyage to a ganker i didn't see coming, and it got no further than partway through a class 1 combat site.i later went into nullsec but i got with a sub-alliance of it alliance right before the catastrophic topple and then gentlemen's agreement afterward, and finally in test. i found out about providence during my time in test after i had joined dromedaworks, and after i was already giving up on trying to unite highsec players into a fighting force to combat highsec piracy. i dream that in another life i could have been very happy in providence, but i'm also happy in test--and the two seem diametrically opposed to each other.more recently i am postulating getting involved in some code. activities. i like their stance on punishing afk ""gameplay"" and teaching newer players how to fit and fly defensively. i'd be more lenient perhaps, focusing on the teaching and doing less of the mafia-style extortion. but it'll perhaps provide me with some networking to help me find people to gank with me when i go ouot to shoot bot miners--which gets me to my last point:i have also ganked. my first blood happened when i was jet-can mining in a retriever and a guy came by in an iteron mk 3 and stole my ore. i did what i normally do, continue as if nothing happened. he came back for more. so i went to station and fit a warp scrambler. sure enough, he comes for a third helping. he didn't get away with it. i later was mining in tekaima (i don't only mine but it fuels my need to gank it seems) and was really fed up with all the bot miners moving in and constantly clearing out the ore. couldn't talk to them, there was nobody present. so i got with a guy who was willing to gank with me, we went up against hulks each in a catalyst. i first selected targets carefully and gave them several minutes to respond, and then when i was convinced they were bot miners, i got him over to help gank.good fun. i am interested to see that you and i have a rather similar history, though it divides suddenly when we enter nullsec. you're one of the good guys now and i'm one of the bad guys. :("
1/29/2015,"this is something i would like to see. there are some subjects in eve that are probably best not introduced early on, but having additional career agents that are accessible after a player has been in the game for awhile would be excellent.founder of violet squadron, a small gang npsi community! mail me for more information."
1/29/2015,"my assumption is anyone who doesn't just stay in the starting system and do constant missions will die horribly in a few days. the question is, how do we get new players used to dying horribly?perhaps one of the tutorial objectives should be ""wander off and get killed by another player""."
1/29/2015,"there is a mission in advanced combat that makes you lose your ship, but it could be improved upon. it lacks that oomph of a real death when it's at the hands of npcs, although it was kind of interesting when i did the mission: i got my cruiser instead of using the intended ship, and tried to brute force my way through it, thinking i would beat the odds. i lost the cruiser and later decided if i could do it again, i might have been able to complete it if i had fit smartbombs."
1/29/2015,"1. what are the 3 most important lessons about eve newbros should be taught within their first 3 days of playing?2. do you want to change the location of the starting systems? if so, where would you put them instead? closer to lowsec & nullsec? cordoned off in an isolated space?3. should mining ships and industrials have more offensive power?"
1/29/2015,"ooh, i like these questions. 1) about eve? basic mechanics, communications with other players, more of the choices than just mine or mission2) i can see an argument for putting them on the perimeter of high sec, to give them the option temptation but i don't think i would actively push for a map shift at this point.3) i loved battle badgers and the idea of an offensive miner appeals to me but only if the offence comes at the cost of mining efficiency. remember the mining rohk?mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
1/29/2015,"for the lessons, i meant something more philosophical, like ""don't fly what you can't afford to lose"", ""expect to die a lot"", and ""better to have many cheap ships than one expensive ship"".as for the mining, i don't remember the mining rokh. i think mining barges are in a good place offense-wise, with the procurer being a tough nut to crack. it's the industrial haulers i'm concerned about, as the t1s can often be blown up by a single t1 frigate. this can be a problem in nullsec.it feels like the intention was for industrials to have escorts, but in practice 90% of them travel by themselves and have to avoid every fight. perhaps a more expensive faction version of the haulers that could hold its own against 1-2 frigates? my main concern is whether that's dissuade newbros from attacking haulers more often, but it might also encourage them to group up and socialize to take them down.although that brings up another question: do you think increased difficulty encourages players to group together? does it need a little nudge to get players grouping? or do you think players group up for other reasons entirely?"
1/29/2015,"ever tried dagan at the end of the sisters arc?yeah i think that we need more of that sort of mission that drives people to cooperate. it could be made optional so the people who really want to fly alone, could. there is a fine line between encouraging and forcing and i want to see us stay on the right side of that line. mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
1/29/2015,"right now one could argue a fair chunk of the pve risk in groups is other players, for obvious reasons. would you advocate group pve content that protected the group from pvp disruption, but have very low rewards to allow groups to practice mechanics and learn the game?follow up, with the change in corp ff mode, would you advocate a ""holo room"" which is effectively sisi on tranq where players can fight each other in a simulation for training and tournaments?"
1/29/2015,"i've always felt that designing pve to act such that a good group of two partnering together is much more than twice as strong as each individually, so that their combined efforts multiply rather than divide. do you see such things as encouraging? like, for instance, if a mission pitted you against a bunch of frigates and cruisers all at once, but if you go in with a frigate and a cruiser each npc will go after the target of their size, allowing you to split up the incoming fire as well as having npcs go toward the player that can better fight them. is that like what you mean?"
1/29/2015,"actually, no i didn't. i bolted for nullsec after completing half the tutorials because they were taking too long and covering stuff i felt i could figure out on my own, and i avoided doing the sisters arc after that because i heard there were plenty of griefers that camped the sites on that mission arc to kill newbros."
1/29/2015,"much of the sov stuff is nda :) i ll ha ve a piece up on eve24 soon, but its pending nda check with ccp currently, i think also for reference, few pists up sion, also csm told in this thread how we connected, on which i agree very much as its mutual"
1/29/2015,"another idea could be to give them fully-fitted ships as rewards for the npe, but have 1-2 modules they need to train into to use. that way they have some direction in planning their skills and get to see what a decently-fitted ship looks like."
1/29/2015,"jayne,the news at 11 shows that your main director who essentially ran the corp has left for greener pastures (koz katral -> pl). what impact will this have on your csm run? will you continue the neglect you have shown to sash?"
1/29/2015,"sigh... really?koz left the corp on good terms. it's no secret that npsi fleets are often made up of pilots who have lower skill points and experience than groups like pl, and koz simply wanted to fly more advanced doctrines with higher skilled pilots.it will have no effect on my run for the csm."
1/29/2015,"i think the suggestion that i essentially ran the corp is an over statement to say the least. jayne has always been at the forefront of anything sash has done. i left the corp on good terms, and i wish them all the best in the future. i think vouches from close friends and corp members are relatively cheesy and predictable - but for what its worth, i think jayne's passion for and understanding of the game, along with his great communication skills, would make him a fantastic csm representative - not just for people who engage in npsi pvp, but for anyone who uses this game as a social platform."
1/29/2015,"this is eve, people scam and cheat others because they can. well i think that all the gameplay at work in eve should be represented. even if he would had cheated me out of something because of x y z reasons. if he was good at it, well good for him. but in any case. trust for someone to work for the game is different than trusting a guy for a corp or other stuff that is realted to you in-game. (if it wasn't clear the way i was saying it, just pm me)"
1/29/2015,"the criticism raised has nothing to do with cheating or scamming, but actual quality of ideas presented and ability to follow through."
1/29/2015,"i don't hold it against you that you may have scammed/stole. this is a viable gameplay tactic and part of eve. we have goons that have a whole culture that celebrates this sort of thing as they should. and so your participation in such activities only shows that you play the game how you want. i flew with spectre fleet a long time ago and i had a lot of fun sniping provibloc fleets with longbows (railcorms.) i think you should be judged fit for csm based on the level of maturity and your ability to deal with criticism. regardless of how you play the game, this quality is the corner stone of anyone being a leader of any community and i'm sure that you agree that out of game maturity is far more important than what you play as in game."

1/29/2015,"not trying to be a ****, but you realize that you can both mine and socialize with buddies at the same time right? i used to be a highsec miner and i did it and it wasn't difficult at all. if you're mad because this may make it harder for you to play a game while you're at work, all i can say is i want your job."
1/29/2015,"i don't hate miners. i was one myself and i have many miner friends that i respect. eve is a sandbox there are not ways of playing it more legit than others. we can argue about certain aspects on how to optimize particular ways of playing to maximize the benefits for example. don't want them out, murdered or anything but i think that mining makes new people stuck themselves and missing a huge part of the game which is sad. i think that eve is a living thing and i want that you have to be there to max the benefits. what's the point in having 20 accounts to play the game without playing the game. socialize? i'm a diplomat, politics is what i do. docked or using external programs. do you want to mine while you are not there? for hours just because it is a very poor way of making isk?i'd rather improve the benefits per hour while making it less likely to be the paradise of betting. i haven't said anything about mini games though. eve needs to start making sure that risk vs benefit becomes true."
1/29/2015,"its not just at work, its i dont want to be trying to find time to type in chat while having to play some absurd minigame every last one of these ""improve mining"" ideas turn into."
1/29/2015,"basically everything that can be trivially escalated horizontally has to be reworked. banning broadcasting in isboxer was the best thing ever. do you want to mine afk? ok, so be it but if you mine and pay attention, you should get rewarded accordingly."
1/29/2015,"so ask yourself, how do you see making mining actually fun with any mechanic, considering they will be doing the exact same thing say, 500-1000 times a day if they are ""active"".this would drive out more miners than it would attract, mining afk or not (and im not saying i want to mine afk, just be able to focus on chatting in the chat boxes instead of being forced to play the same interaction over and over and over again on screen. its the primary reason why i, and most miners, mine instead of mission)"
1/29/2015,"most newbie miners, according to my experience in multiple helping channels and so on, mine because they know nothing else and they think that mining is a good way to make isk. it actually isn't. i don't want to get rid of miners, again. i want that newbros aren't stuck in mining since their first day because the game pushes you to do that. mine if you like that. stay docked if you like that. its up to you. your game, your choice. things that scalate horizontally that easily are the heaven for botters. and we must get rid of botters.i think that risk vs reward and staying at the keyboard are important things for a online game. you are not part of the scenery. you are a player, alive and you should be there playing the game. also, this doesn't mean that you should be forced to pay 150% of attention to mine like every second so you don't have even a second to type in chat. between black and white there are many scales of grey."
1/29/2015,"i find it rather odd you admit you don't find an activity fun, yet you continuously do said activity and vehemently oppose any proposed changes to it. you're admitting you want to play eve by not playing the game and doing something else. please think about that for a couple of minutes."
1/29/2015,"hello, my name is dominik and i am 25 years old. i have played eve for a few years now and, in the past year, i started to work on some personal projects in eve. one such project was my corporation: ""stille gewalt"" which coincided with another project which is an npsi community under the same name.my primary focus in eve is low sec pvp where i engage in all flavors of pvp from small to large scale fleets which i achieve through interacting with the eve community through my npsi group.my npsi group has become quite popular amongst the german playerbase and the greater eve community. you may have joined one of our fleets or attended one of our events such as our carrier events. when i'm not doing community work; i am a low sec pirate, fc, corp ceo and alliance director for one of the largest alliances in minmatar space.whether i am flying the banner of my npsi community or alliance; i am dedicated to finding good content. if elected, i would strive to provide ccp the necessary feedback and suggestions to help guide the game into a content-rich environment for all types of players and play-styles.i believe, with my experience with interacting with the many different players and play-styles in eve, that i would be a prime candidate for csm x.thanks for reading,citricioni"
1/29/2015,"respect for throwing your hat in the ring! but csm work means lobbying on behalf of the players, so what are the 3 most important things (changes, additions to the game) you will fight for if elected?"
1/29/2015,"thanks for your question1. creating a simple environment for newer players to discover which area is the ""right thing"" for them. currently it is still difficult without the help of the community to get in. i see it many times that newer players stop playing before they can see the beautiful side of that game. maybe something like a more ingame-based platform for community work, like the help channel but with menus and some features. it would be helpful for everyone who want to help people, announce things, come together and maybe some new players easier find the great things in that game. at the moment we have the chat channels, the forum, every ingame community got their own forum too, and 3rd party tools like fleetup and co.all that as ""ingamecontent"" would be great.2. creating a more diverse environment for the care bears and miner.smarter, more varied and sometimes stronger npcs & more entertainment for miners.i know most of the mission runners maybe like or don't have a problem that they run the same mission 123456 times but i'm sure it will be greater if it is more random how a mission is and not everytime the same x missions.3. t2 capitals, everyone wants to see them! t3 battleships! more and more shipsa flood of new ships.even though i know that it is not easy for ""balancing"" reasons to get more ships fast.but: more ships = more variations = more funi know there are some mistakes but you know i'm not a native speaker :)regardscitricioni"
1/29/2015,"wardecs principelly seem to be a good idea to bring alliances and corporations in highsec in conflict. but most of the time wardecs are restricted to tradehub camping. it shouldn't be possible to declare war on more then hundred corporations/alliances without any drawbacks. wardec should be an expensive way, to counter your competition. wardec should more an active campaign, where both sides should forced to interact with each other. i have no special idea how to realize this. but i want to discuss, how this can be made. ganking should be more than camping and bumping. i have no problem, if ganking is an act of capabilities. but there should always a way to counter. especially the freighter bumping with machariels and so on. shouldn't be that easy. i heard much about it and made my own experiences. there is no way to counter, if you get bumped for an hour or longer (besides logoff). webbing is no solution, if the bumper is faster than you on your freighter. the most other mechanisms are fine. maybe the risk vs. reward should be corrected a bit, since destroyers not that expencive. think, it's a bit of both sites. there should be more competition between corporations. and i would like to see ""corporation tasks"" especially in missions. some corporations members never interact with an other (besides some ts chatter). there could be more. i thought industrial teams would the answer, if that teams are corporate members (or maybe members from other corporations), but not npcs. maybe there is a way to implement this that way."

1/30/2015,"here is an idea that could even expand industry. blueprints for expansions or modifications to captains quarters. why? because it would be a sink for minerals, and an isk sink. not to mention, more things that could be input into the economy to give it a more realistic feel. why not make trade goods actually good for something other than just sitting around in a hangar? make them consumable by blueprints for expanding cq, creating decorum, et cetera. everyone whines about problems, but provides no suggestions, and that is only you being part of the problem. offering suggestions or solutions becomes you being part of the solution as a whole. we have a massive community that proposes a great and many things that could be useful, create more immersion, new careers (think interior decorator for those who would find interest in that). the more we add to the game in a constructive fashion, the longer it will last, the greater legacy and impact it will have as well.leave things better than you found them. so keep ideas and communications on things flowing. sure, you'll get trolls and nay-sayers, but eventually, someone's idea gets picked up and becomes a part of eve.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."

1/30/2015,really gonna need you to finish that thought so i know what you're talking about.
1/30/2015,"regarding day 3 and merchandise i had this thought that i posted on reddit:really disappointed on the general lack of information regarding merchandise. it really annoys me ccp refuses to capitalize on the eve brand and make merchandise many of us are begging for. i want a tea mug, a pen, stickers, lanyard, badge holders, cups, air freshener for car, etc. many companies do this; they farm it out to a 3rd party and give them the license to make swag with their logo on it. even smaller companies do they so they have ""stuff"" to give away/sell.got a ccp response; now happypost is here:"
1/30/2015,"i would like to advise you of a situation of which you've probably already heard - but which is causing a growing disquiet amongst players - sometimes causing them to de-activate their accounts.the problem is this......i.... like quite a few other players - do not wish to engage in pvp at all - you will find i am mostly a pve player, having run thousands of missions at level 4.however - as a subscriber to the game - my experience is being ruined by gate campers in low sec systems whose ships are fitted for pvp where mission runners fit for pve. they are camping the gates and locking down upon entry to the low sec system meaning three things.1) loss of the ship and mods2) declining of the mission - losing standing points3) dis-interest in the game - with a reluctance to want to play.it is highly unfair that pve capsuleers have to deal with pvp players. our ships are fitted completely differently.... and often its not even 1 on 1 - its like 15-20 on one. leaving you absolutely no chance at all. if i wasn't subscribing - i wouldn't care less, but i am - i pay for it - and feel that the satisfaction i receive from game play now falls very short of the mark. why should i consider paying you when i can't play the game i want to play.i have spoken in rl to at least 1-200 players in the uk who all feel the same way. 1 friend of mine who plays eve has recently de-activated all 6 of his accounts because of this issue. this at the end of the day is lost revenue toccp!!!!! his situation alone has cost ccp <U+FFFD>720.00 in one year. multiply that by other multiple account players all doing the same and it isn't going to take long before your revenue comes into some noticeable decline.please please please accept the following suggestion.1) once a pve player accepts a mission in low sec from his agent - grant the mission runner some immunity from pvp players. this means that upon entry to the low sec system - the mission runner will show as a different colour to the rest of the players and cannot be locked or scrambled. in turn - the mission runner cannot lock or scramble a player either. only an npc.2) lock down the mission gates so that only the player that accepted his mission can use them in order to prevent pvp players from scanning for and entering the mission theatre and destroying you there.3) lock down all other stargates in the mission system other than the route there and home whilst the mission is in acceptance. this means that there can be no abuse by the player who accepts the mission. once the mission is accepted - it has to be done and you can't jump to other systems to ferry cargo for example - which i know some players may wish to exploit.4) the immunity period lasts only as long as the mission bonus deadline. if the deadline passes - the mission runner is no longer immune to pvp players targeting. this will also mean that then the player has a choice - i) do the mission straight away, or ii) if the bonus deadline passes - he can risk it or decline. - that's fair!!!!5) another alternative would be to give players the option of working for agents at level 4 or level 5 that only provide missions in high sec and do not send into low sec space even at the expense of lower lp's and isk rewards.i urge you to listen to this - because probably unknown to you - it really is becoming a problem ingame.i really love playing eve - and i know many other players who love playing it too. so please.... be fair!!! we are paying you don't forget. it is therefore fair that the players who subscribe have at least a chance to play the game that they wish to play without the aggro of more aggressive players ruining their game play.in reference to the above - i don't even attempt level 5 missions anymore. i really want to do them too - but just simply can't - because as soon as you accept - your mission theatre is invaded by pvp players who lock you down and destroy your ship. as if a mission 5 solo isn't hard enough anyway!!!please can you let me know your thoughts."
1/30/2015,my thoughts are as follows:no.hell no.go back to wow.
1/30/2015,"if troll 0/10if not... every single one of your ideas runs afoul of the core tenets of eve such as, but are not limited to...- no instancing, ever.- everyone is allowed to affect each other for better or worse.- industry affects pve which affects pvp which can affect industry and pve back. - everything you do in eve requires that you be in competition with someone else... meaning you are always pvping in a sense (either directly or indirectly).- *important one* all styles of play are supposed to come into conflict with one another... whether they like it or not.- industrialists and pveers must learn some basic pvp... pvpers must learn basic industry and pve. neither side can get away with being ""pure.""if you still think that you are entitled to being left alone** then i do not think eve is the game you want. and i rarely say that to anyone.** note:taken from this thread:"
1/30/2015,"posting a lengthy response would feel a little redundant now, so i'll just say...wrong game. play another. it's quite possible to avoid combat in this game - but avoiding the interference of others in your activities is just another form of pvp - which you don't want to engage in."

1/30/2015,"ahoy steve.you are a hero of the new eden peoples and we thank you for your efforts thus far on the csm. here is what i would like to ask about in regards to the next term:in your capstable interview you were questioned briefly about npsi groups and their access to in-game communication tools. i thought the answer given to this was good, but can you comment on how external third party development could benefit these communities? if you agree that currently there is room for it to do so.overall what has been your biggest disappointment on ccp's end whilst serving on the csm this last year? also what is your stance on the present state of ""boosters"" in the game? both in respect to their actual usage as well as creation. is this an area that could benefit from an overhaul?lastly, you find yourself in an ice cream parlour on a hot summers day. sadly there are only two flavours of ice-cream left over. chocolate & tutti frutti. which flavour do you choose?thanks. twitter || www.tricksofthetrades.net"
1/30/2015,"in turn:npsi: external tools can, certainly, help organise the npsi community. fleetup, for example, does wonders for sharing fits, and its use of sso makes the speed bump of registration minimal. one of the biggest problems (that i see. i may be a touch blinkered) is discoverability. the communities exist, but getting them into the hands of new players is more difficult. ideally a search function would be possible, both in and out of game, which can make finding them easier. and then also the basic management tools online, so you can accept members, kick them, send messages to them, and so on, from outside the client, which means that you can spend your online in client time on what's really important (shooting people in the face) being able to automate bits of it would also be handy.disappointments:this is a difficult one to answer. i'd have liked to see more happen with crest, but i can understand why it didn't (have to be careful with access to tq.) ditto with alliance logos (bah, lawyers. ) while there were some communications problems, and some things going out to the community, before we'd had much of a chance to review them, again, i can understand why it happened.and while you didn't ask, my biggest disappointment with myself, is the initial freighter rework, with rigs. i should have caught that. i just ran the stats, and completely forgot about how expensive the rigs actually are.boosters:i've not done much with boosters, but i don't think they're in a particularly good place right now. they deserve an overhaul, both for use, and for creation. (ditto with reactions. those are painful to setup). something i'd really like to see is more use of synth. possibly as part of the npe. just to introduce players to them, rather than depending on other players to learn about them. possibly have some agents give it out too (in limited numbers). just to give people their first taste. oh, and have them able to be contracted ('just' mark courier contracts as containing illegal goods)i would probably go with chocolate. tutti frutti has so many variations."

1/30/2015,"this might be an odd way of answering your question, but tonight on the eve down under show i had a great deal to say about my opinion of the npe. tomorrow once i get the audio of the show in my hands i'll post a link to a soundcloud of it which should address your question.dt is a big issue for a lot of autz players since it falls during our primetime; something many us and eu tz players wouldn't appreciate the impact of. eliminating downtime entirely is probably a pipe dream without some very intensive changes to the core systems of eve. to that end i don't think it's something we can realistically expect.however, during edu2013 ccp fozzie took a straw poll of people in attendance and in a post-edu survey i also canvassed the community for their preferences. the general consensus seems to be that moving downtime earlier by 3 hours to 08:00 utc might be the best outcome for the autz without impacting too much on us and eu.the result would be thus (local time):- west coast us would now have dt at midnight- east coast us would now have dt at 3am- west eu would have dt at 9am- rus (most of them) would now have dt at 11am- and autz would have dt at ~7pm (est) - meaning that by the time they sat down at the pc after dinner and putting the kids to bed they'd have the entire evening - uninterrupted* - to play internet spaceships with their mates..an 08:00 utc dt shouldn't be too terrible for ccp's server teams either.i won't make some foolhardy statement like promising to get dt moved if i'm on the csm, but it's something that ccp have inquired about independently which suggests to me they've given it some thought already and as an autz player myself i'm acutely aware of the inconvenience the current timing of dt causes. i have my preference for when it should be as outlined above, and if there is any opportunity to advance that change to ccp you bet i'm going to push it.* not factoring in spouse aggro.eve down under - a community for players in the autz"
1/30/2015,what do you think about ccp's initiative to just remove dt entirely...?
1/30/2015,this sounds like a great solution!
1/30/2015,"c1 to c4 are in a better place now than they used to be although c1 and c2 could maybe use a bit of a buff still.on c5 and c6 cap escalations it gets a bit trickier if its 5 people min maxing then its probably to high (although you are limited on how many sites you have to run a day), the issue comes in when you have 10 plus people running them and then the isk isnt all that great (ish per hour might still be good but you will only run sites for 1 hour). the main problem is there is no incentive to run sites with more people. i'd love if there was some way they scaled to incentive people to do them in bigger groups (a bit like incursions)."
1/30/2015,i'd argue that damn near all of the danger in pve comes from other players. but i would not argue for too much more protection because that ill prepares them for the big beyond. see that is where the concept of balance comes in. i object to guys greening their killboard by blapping people less than three weeks old but then i also object to giving protection to people making stupid mistakes like rushing into a ship they are not ready for only to lose it to the aforementioned 'l33t pvp3rs'. so darwinism is maybe the answer but with a little help. i wan tfocus on keeping new players but not at the cost of losing the basic essence of the game which i presume was what brought them here in the first place. nothat is what sisi is. i have said before that i like them to have some 'skin in the game' and so losses on tq should be real.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>

1/30/2015,recently we spoke about some of the more upsetting conspiracy theories in eve online. i asked you if you in all honesty put any validity in the claim that i secretly/magical/etc went to iceland to vandalize my own name on the eve monument. you told me that you did believe this. while i found this unsettling it's your right to believe what you want. my questions are based on the subject of belief and how this affects your function as a delegate. as a candidate for csm 10 how would you go about reconciling the beliefs you have in a context where they conflict with ccp?as a csm delegate would you be willing to concede certain stances if those stances were seen by others to be a distraction?
1/30/2015,"oh trust me, me and ccp are not on the same page on a bunch of topics especially ship balancing and i have no problem calling them out or getting called out on that. i try my best to argue my point and they do the same. we are probably never going to 100% agree on a topic and i am not going to lay down dead just because we don't agree. i don't really have any stances that are seen as a distraction because i actually play this game enough to know whats ******** and whats not.as for the first part: lol the world is out to get you."

1/30/2015,"i think the biggest issue getting players through the npe is that crucial first 30 mins to an hour. people need to be grabbed in that timeframe except we all know that eve isn't a game that's easily played in 30 min - 1 hour bursts, let alone that very first 60 minutes. there's one key way they could get round this and i can't discuss it in too much detail as it is ndaed but i certainly hope ccp follow through on it.i didn't spot marc's post but wrt csm members identities being private or not, i really don't have a particularly strong opinion either way. if someone in eve really wants to go after you, they can probably find your real name pretty easily - gamergate only proves this thesis imho. on the other hand, there are some great potential csmers out there who haven't stood up to now because they didn't want their names public. i guess we shouldn't be making it easier for them ofc but i certainly have zero issues with my name being public then ccp changing the rules down the line."

1/30/2015,"i love the off grid warfare links, so maybe there is a little problem.but maybe some changes would be great: a weapon timer for the ship with the links when the links are activated, when someone in a boosted position in the fleet get a weapon timer (easier to catch them on gates/stations) warp inhibiton as long the links are active, but then a reduced duration and cap need or a new skill to reduce the duration and the cap need of the modules."
1/30/2015,"to show what ""new"" ships i want, for the battleships i think about something like that:strategic battleship (dreadnought baby & carrier)- coordination module with offense & defense mode. duration of the coordination module similar to the bastion with one minute while the module is inactive are the pros / cons of modes not present. prior to that, you can switch between defense and offense by a script.- advantage through a module for both: you can change your fitting with the refiting use of a depot, nestor.... and got a other ship with a other function but it is still very good at that what it do.- jump range as the black ops but not on covert cyno- the slot layout more like the marauder and not like the black opsthe offense mode- higher damage: significantly above tier 3 bc, tech 1 bs & marauder but still less than the dreadnought- increased range- open for support from other players- slightly lower resistancethe defense mode- no support from other players- increased own tank capacity, higher resistance and increased repair amount on armor repairer & shield booster- reduced dps- lower range- bonus on remote repairer- the remote repair amount should be between logistics and the remote repair of the carrier without triage, self tank above the marauder but lower than the carrier without triage (more like the marauder)the defense mode is the risky part because you need to make sure that this ship don't get a ""uber""tank for small scale fleetsfor pve suitable (eg incursions & wormholes)"

1/30/2015,"marolona,as you know, the nda is extremely important for the csm to do its work, and there have been past csms (darius iii, specifically) who did not take the nda seriously and leaked a number of csm skype logs. one can only assume this has reduced the willingness of ccp to work with the csm.given your history of leaking logs from past jobs you've worked at, like the themittani.com logs that you dumped on failheap (without any personal information removed, and with absolutely nothing interesting in them), how would you respond to voter concerns that you, too, might leak logs from the csm like darius iii?thanks!"

1/30/2015,"here, i'll post it in a different way.marlona, you asserted that the reason for ccp's supposed hesitance in keeping the csm in the loop (as cited by sion kumitomo in the csm 9 year in review dev blog) was because ""it has become very apparent to them and even the player base - there is some loose lips on the csm."" should you get elected, what do you feel would make your involvement with csm 10 any different, given your past behavior?regarding the statement that ""no personal information was leaked"" in those logs: lucia denniard, who you had host the logs, can attest that personal information was in the original logs you provided. she was requested to remove any references to people's real world names, and had to run a script to remove that information. this can be proven when comparing the logs hosted to the original logs.since the csm has had issues with, as you put it, ""loose lips"" what do you feel makes you exempt from that stigma if you were elected to csm 10?"
1/30/2015,what are your thoughts on fighter assign?
1/30/2015,"marlona has been smearing his hot steaming opinions all over various fora for years now and has proven again and again to be unreliable, clueless and irritating. coupled with his penchant for leaking information he is trusted with as evidenced by the tmc jabber log leak, i am sure he will be a good fit for the csm."
1/30/2015,over powered. needs a serious look at limiting where fighter assigning can happen. solution could involve not allowing fighter adding if a pos tower/pos shield or station is closer than 100 km. maybe slow the speed down to zero of the carrier to prevent 'align to safety whe assigning' coward tactics.maybe the best solution is to remove fighter assign completely till it can be reintroduced in a more balanced way.

1/30/2015,ok
1/30/2015,marlona: can you talk about the tmc jabber logs dump and why you felt that was necessary or the reasoning behind it? and what reassurances can you give us the community that such a thing wouldnt happen with more sensitive things like csm skype logs..reference:
1/30/2015,marlona can you leak me a convo where it is clearly explained why you would be a good fit for the csm?
1/30/2015,"marlona really cares about the game, and he has shown time and again that he's prepared to put in the effort not just to identify an issue (the easy part) but to analyse it and work through the components and identify the core problems. that kind of analysis is exactly the resource the csm needs when it comes to dealing with the big problems we want them to represent to ccp.it doesn't matter a tiny bit if you hate the solutions that marlona has proposed, because to be candid, ccp devs tend to ignore solutions proposed by csms (and for good reasons). what they absolutely do take on board are well reasoned, properly presented analyses of why 'x' is a problem and why it's going to create further problems down the road. (or how 'y' can be an opportunity)."

1/30/2015,"good luck with that, you log-leaker."
1/30/2015,"marlona has demonstrated that he is particularly well suited to the office of csm. his willingness to compromise, and his flexibility, are well documented. others might be inclined to ""stick to their guns"", stubbornly, on issues great and small. marlona has compromised on such issues, and will probably continue to do so. marlona has demonstrated a remarkable ability to hold nuanced views on unequivocally stated positions, which is --as with real world politics-- vitally necessary to accomplish one's goals in any real capacity. that these character traits are indeed adaptive to csm service can be seen in the spirited endorsements of csm members past and present; this are no mere conjecture on my part.you have my vote!"
1/30/2015,"thanks for the welcome. it should be a rather entertaining race. so far nothing i can't handle. would be nice to get some more real questions instead of the ultra exaggerated and flat out lies from some people though. but, nothing i wasn't expecting from the usual grrr marlona rabble."
1/30/2015,here's a question for you. i know you spend a fair amount of time helping newer players in-game. can you talk a little bit about that and share some of the most serious challenges you've seen them struggle with during their trial period and for the first couple of months in-game? what are some methods you would like to see ccp employ to mitigate the most common new player struggles?
1/30/2015,"that you don't want to answer them doesn't make them any less real. so far, everything you've claimed was untrue has been truthful.ultimately while leaking personal information was bad judgment, everyone does something stupid every so often. what's really worrying though is the apparent inability to own up to a mistake. that personal information was in those logs has been so well-documented to be undeniable. so one has to question why you try so hard to insist it was not there and that everyone saying the sky is blue is lying, rather than own up to that you made an error in judgment and saying that you'll do better next time. an inability to own up to mistakes is not a good trait, lying about them an even worse one."
1/30/2015,i'll try phrasing my question another way: should people in a working group like the csm with access to a non-public channel like skype or jabber have a reasonable expectation of privacy and be able to have candid and honest discourse about the game?
1/30/2015,can you leak post a list of these grr marlona rabble you speak of? it might make csd's job of keeping this thread clean easier if you rat them out.
1/30/2015,"why should i choose only one platform when i have experience with each of these individual aspects of the game? would you much rather want a csm representative that will only push for their little piece of space, or do you want someone that will try to make the game better as a whole?"

1/31/2015,"i have removed some rule breaking posts and those quoting them. as always i let some edge cases stay.please people, keep it on topic and above all civil!the rules:3. ranting is prohibited. a rant is a post that is often filled with angry and counter productive comments. a free exchange of ideas is essential to building a strong sense of community and is helpful in development of the game and community. rants are disruptive, and incite flaming and trolling. please post your thoughts in a concise and clear manner while avoiding going off on rambling tangents. 4. personal attacks are prohibited. commonly known as flaming, personal attacks are posts that are designed to personally berate or insult another forum user. posts of this nature are not beneficial to the community spirit that ccp promote and as such they will not be tolerated.5. trolling is prohibited. trolling is a defined as a post that is deliberately designed for the purpose of angering and insulting other players in an attempt to incite retaliation or an emotional response. posts of this nature are disruptive, often abusive and do not contribute to the sense of community that ccp promote.7. discussion of real life religion and politics is prohibited.discussion of real life religion and politics is strictly prohibited on the eve online forums. discussions of this nature often creates animosity between forum users due to real life political or military conflicts. ccp promotes the growth of a gaming community where equality is at the forefront. nationalist, religious or political afiliations are not part of eve online, and should not be part of discussion on the eve online forums.27. off-topic posting is prohibited. off-topic posting is permitted within reason, as sometimes a single comment may color or lighten the tone of discussion. however, excessive posting of off-topic remarks in an attempt to derail a thread may result in the thread being locked, or a forum warning being issued to the off-topic poster. isd ezwal community communication liaisons (ccls)"
1/31/2015,"it looks as though there is a considerable turnout, and i am trying to round all of you up to get the high-sec force to work on fixing up this long-stagnated region. i am really excited to see that not only are there so many of you, but you've got great ideas and completely unique viewpoints! you in particular would appear to be the first carebear candidate this round, to which i must say i am a tad surprised.you've got an interesting perspective from the standpoint of one who likes to run package delivery. we throughout eve rely a lot on you folks for our logistics teams but we don't always consider your feelings. as you are a casual gamer, i think you'll find a lot of agreement with mike azariah's style. he has already been in the csm twice in a row and is highly likely to win a third seat. i assume you knew by now that he is indeed running again.well i'd like to see you bounce ideas off the other highsec candidates. i want your unique input. you've said you're fighting for the right to play your way and for the chance to survive, well one of the big topics that jenshae chiroptera and i have been discussing recently is providing tools for the defender to allow them to step up their game with skill and save their shipments or whatever it is they're defending. so if you've got the time, please stop by my highsec reform thread. i'm hoping to get at least a bit of input from all of you, and i want you all to come with an open mind. i believe that all highsec candidates can work together through differing opinions and goals, united toward one grander goal: that highsec definitely needs work!"
1/31/2015,let the propaganda begin ! tell your friends to vote for me or pod them
1/31/2015,"hi tora, i am interested in your campaign, especially in your ideas for adjusting crime. i feel it is excellent that you slide both ways, seeing problems with an unbiased view, where most slide too far to one side or the other on such issues. there will never be too many clear-headed candidates.i wish to apologize for passing up your campaign thread on my initial pass, and wish to get to know you better as a csm candidate before voting opens up. i have a feeling i may wind up adding you to my growing list. i'm hoping you will also consider contributing to my highsec reform thread in jita park--there is a large turnout this year of good highsec reform candidates with great ideas across the board and i'm really hoping it means the start of something great. highsec needs a lot of work and it's about time that work got under way. i've already spoken with a casual gamer (mike azariah), a staunch defender (jenshae chiroptera), and an attitude reformist (sabriz adoudel), so it'll be nice to add the ceo of marmite to this list.as to your ideas, i have no gripes or changes currently (just not in the mood) but i am very interested in such things as improving ability for prey to fight back, giving financial incentive to hunt people for their implants, and encouraging atk gameplay."
1/31/2015,"joined wormhole space this year as a bitter vet (10yr+) looking for something different - it worked.in doing almost everything in eve can say corbexx has been the only csm representative i have actually interacted with (at a couple of his townhalls, he even came onto tdsin teamspeak to get our views on some changes) and who seemed to know what he was there for and ask for opinions. sure we might not always agree but he has been a great representative of the wh community and csm in general. when i saw he was standing again my vote became a no brainer +1 regarding some of the comments above:like the idea of some degradation of untended anchored mods, there is so much litter in space. hacking to unanchor it sounds good as requires skill and effort not just after a while bring ship to scoop stuff. tbh we all know pos mods etc need a revamp (eg why do compression arrays work on solid minerals but not gas which should be more compressible and volumes of which get big very quickly or why do we need so many different assembly arrays)corbexx has been a great representative and should be again."
1/31/2015,you missed the whole point of the question. i don't want to argue whether it is an isk faucet or not. i wanted a link to a piece of writing on the subject that corbexx finds particularly good.
1/31/2015,not a writing but the results from all my pve testing
1/31/2015,okay. forget the subject completely! link a post that you admire for being really well thought out and is the sort you would like to see on the forums more.
1/31/2015,"i remember running c1 sites adjacent to a c2 because the c2 sites were worthless. it was all about the frigates because they dropped the most expensive loot despite going down the quickest.i hear it's not quite so much like that anymore, which is really good. also, the value per nanoribbon is under half what we were getting for them. back then (mid 2012) we would sell the things for 8 mil apiece to the already available buy orders, or we could put em up for around 9 mil and get them to sell."
1/31/2015,"population distribution is a zero sum game - the more people and the more stuff you put in hi sec, the more you are going to concentrate the population there and keep other areas barren. when a great many ills of the game could be squarely pinned on the concentration of population in hi sec, this seems like a poor choice.have the people who want the content come to low sec. if content creators want to follow them there, fantastic. more l5 hubs, possibly even neutral l5 agents; sure these are good, but they belong in low sec. the rest of the game is already suffering from the content and income present in hi sec."
1/31/2015,"i want to unpack the caveats that i added to the post about balancing rewards.currently, there's a fair number of resource/wealth creating things you can do in highsec. mining, level 4 missions, level 1-3 missions, incursions, anomolies, non-combat exploration, combat exploration, belt ratting. i'll exclude more immediately competitive activities that redistribute wealth rather than create it (such as trading or suicide ganking) and pi, production or invention (as they are mostly 'set and forget' operations rather than processes you are engaged in while you gain resources).of these, several are clear 'wrong' choices from a game theoretical point of view. belt ratting, anomolies and level 1-2 missions offer so little in rewards that noone would consider doing them for the in-game rewards. players that actively enjoy one of these activities find the game sharply pushes them out of their preferred activity.then there's the second tier - mining, level 3 missions, level 4 missions for corps with bad lp rewards, incursion scout sites, combat exploration and non-combat exploration. these provide resources that (generally) aren't worth bothering to fight over but that people that *actively enjoy* the activity won't feel they are wasting their time for doing them. (noone actively enjoys mining, but that's a totally different issue)then there's the top tier - incursion fleet sites, and level 4 missions for the sisters. these offer so much in the way of rewards that *even people that do not enjoy doing them* wind up feeling obliged to run them, or feel disadvantaged if they still elect not to.i would not want to see level 5 missions added if they would fit into that last category. i'd rather see a rewards structure that, once you factor in expected losses, makes efficiently running level 5 missions in highsec on par with the current rewards for running level 4 missions for a non-sisters corp. as for lowsec and l5s - i do not see any evidence that l5s are drawing people into lowsec and do not consider them important to low at all. highsec incursions, 0.1-0.2 belt ratting (for clones and mordus spawns) and fw all offer better rewards and a lower risk compared to any of the main ways of doing l5s (solo with a carrier, solo swapping between blinged mission-tailored neut-resistant ships, spidertanked battleships, fleet with logi). if i felt l5s were a unique thing pulling people into low, i would agree with you. they are not the game's premier repeat-almost-on-demand group pve content (that is c5-6 sites and incursions).however, i will repeat my caveat in different words - if l5s are added to highsec, and the same broad reward formula is used as is used for current l4s, they will actively make eve worse, just as highsec incursions make the game worse for (almost) every non-participant in them. balance is key."
1/31/2015,"i have removed a rule breaking post and the one quoting it.the rules:5. trolling is prohibited. trolling is a defined as a post that is deliberately designed for the purpose of angering and insulting other players in an attempt to incite retaliation or an emotional response. posts of this nature are disruptive, often abusive and do not contribute to the sense of community that ccp promote.isd ezwal community communication liaisons (ccls)"
1/31/2015,"i have a similar experiences. the only worm hole people i know who do not care about frigate link are in c5 and c6 systems.corbexx does deny this and says ccp number show no major decline. however, further on that - what time frame? new or old corps? etc."
1/31/2015,"people are not all min-maxing automatons. just making sure the rewards fit in with other hi sec activities, which may be too high in the first place, would not prevent lots of people from engaging in it. i'm not sure about drawing in, at least not presently, but the groups built around the level 5 hubs i know about don't seem to mind the income from them. more l5 hubs in low sec couldn't hurt, and could let more groups move into places. the point i'm trying to raise isn't so much about the state of l5s in low sec, it's that putting more of anything in hi sec is feeding a problem.but again, people are not min-maxing automatons. giving people another reason to stay in hi sec, even a sub-optimal one, is bad. i still think this comes down to you approaching this problem too mathematically - people are not rational actors, the game is full of people doing sub-optimal isk/hr activities. now, i think you want more missioners in hi sec so you have more and more expensive targets to go after, which, while i can't argue against that being a good thing, just like mission runners shouldn't have everything available to them in hi sec, neither should you, the antagonists, have the best selection of prey in hi sec."
1/31/2015,"i look forward to the article, but i have to say i'm quite dissatisfied with the communication that csm9 has (rather, hasn't) had with the player base."
1/31/2015,"this is a content creator people, and that is what keeps eve moving.my vote is with chance."
1/31/2015,"you've got my vote too.you've managed to bridge the daunting chasm into which new players often fall after spending too much time shooting stationary rocks and red crosses. truly, there is grand content to experience after training a raven that does not involve cancelling a subscription, and chance has done much to show the way to those who don't realize there is a way."
1/31/2015,i like the direction of your ideas around exploration and deployables. also giving hackers a job in fleets would be a nice thing.
1/31/2015,i was sharing some ideas about the future of eve/legion/valkyrie on reddit but thought they might have some value here! the pasting/formatting is rough but you should be able to follow the basic idea there.o7
1/31/2015,very interesting.
1/31/2015,"thanks i think it<U+FFFD>s a great idea. there is a balance to be struck with social groups (being in a corporation should still have advantages / disadvantages) and i believe the challenge facing ccp and the csm will be to strike that balance and make sure they have distinct roles and purposes. bringing it in game makes sense to me because these groups already exist, we use them daily, but it<U+FFFD>s just that they have no formal structure in the game. this means that at the moment to run one of these communities you have to live out of a channel and a mailing list (or more than one in some cases) or have it experts on hand and design / program a web site, maybe if you are lucky you can rely on existing web services, however these are at the mercy of 3rd parties very often and can go away just like that (and they have done in the past leaving groups high and dry), that's definitely not a situation we want to persist.i would love to see social groups in eve become the new way we enable some of the less socially engaged players to take a more social approach to gameplay, they can join in on communities with less commitment than joining a corporation and also less scrutiny (i'm sure we've all seen and recognise this comic).i can see that people have legitimate concerns about how social groups may impact the game, in particular things like wardecs which are a big reason people don't want to form a corporation instead of a social group, however wardecs are not the only way to disrupt these groups and as long as being a member of a social group doesn't completely replace corporations and the two have distinct roles and purposes i would hope that would balance outin whatever form they take, social groups definitely need to be something that are introduced to new players as well as soon as possible because this is a social game, it works best when you interact with others and the people that engage with others in the community are the ones that stay the longest.jayne has quite a list going there and the only one or two i have real disagreement on. the first of these is group contracts, i can understand the desire for these however to balance out the corporate / social group system you really need to have some distinctions and i believe contracts is one candidate for this. the second is fleet to fleet standings, mechanically i could see this being a pain to implement. rather than this i would like to see fleet size caps increased, this would ease problems like golden fleet and ganked 100. standings generally are not issues you face if you are in a corp / alliance and it<U+FFFD>s one of the things i feel may be a good differentiator to balance out social groups against corporations and alliances.as for things i would like to add, labels are relatively new and i would like to see labels included as a resource for granting / denying access. setting someone to bad standing because they are a pain and you don't want them joining your fleet can have unintended consequences. i would like to be able to say - deny access to all the people i have labelled.group bookmarks or linkable bookmarks (being able to drag a bookmark into chat) is something i would also like to see, that would benefit the npsi and similar communities. i would love to see a wider range of drugs (combat boosters) available in eve, more multi bonused drugs like quafe or new drugs that would affect things like overheating or agility. i would love to see changes to the mechanics surrounding drugs as well (transporting them for example) to make it more engaging to play as the drug runner.as for implants, i would love to see learning implants go away to one degree or another, i like in principle the idea of them being rolled into base stats, which is friendly for new bro's but has the disadvantage that you can't min-max your training as much if you are an experienced player. hard-wirings are a whole other matter and i was already in the process of writing some words on that subject so please bear with me on that one.i'm afraid i<U+FFFD>m a chocoholic."
1/31/2015,"but thats not how supply and demand works, you either drastically nerf semi-passive mining's rate to the point its not worth doing so people will actually do the active version, or you make the active version several magnitudes more ""valuable"", but since this is just grabbing resources, it will just increase the mineral influx, driving down all the prices, until the active version is at the same if not slightly above current, and the passive is no longer able to make any income whatsoever.remember gun mining? that was basically the ""pay attention and get more minerals than regular mining"" option, ccp removed it because it ended up being a significant source of minerals, and a primary reason why mining was such ****** income then to begin with."
1/31/2015,"i'm pretty sure that when ccp banned broadcasting many people came up to the same conclussion: oh, now that multiboxing miners aren't reliable in huge scale, the market is going to be damaged! eve is going to die!pretty much the same when ice belts were removed, etc. the reality is that people will adapt to new mechanics and will always find a way to take advantage of them.removing botting from eve is very important. and be on the screen should always be more rewarding than not. in highsec you simply are a drop in an ocean of horrible tanked mackinaws that are going to die in a 0.5 so you feel safer.ninja-gas mining in a c6 with a week old venture can net you more isk than mining with a full skilled mackinaw per hour. of course risk is much bigger."

1/31/2015,lmbo good luck getting an honest answer to this well-crafted and reasonable question
1/31/2015,q: should a csm candidates constituency be the entire eve playerbase or is it right for them to ignore people or alliance tags they dont like?
1/31/2015,ignoring someone because they fly a different corp/alliance flag or enjoy a different part of the game than you is a terrible philosophy to have as a csm.
1/31/2015,"the days following this is eve trailer was amazing in the rookie help channel. the place was flooded with new players with what seemed like the same tutorial snags. it was amazing to see the veteran players jump in and tirelessly answer the endless flood of questions. while the current tutorial is infinitely better than what i experienced as a new player, it still needs work. i spent a good amount of time in the rookie channel doing everything from answering basic questions to helping with anti-gank fits for their ventures. even taking to skype to do screen shares and walking them through specific parts. for one new player i spent an hour and a half with him figuring things out. he is doing well in eve university and i believe planning on joint rvb after.for changes to it i would like to see more immediate action for the new player to experience. maybe they start off with limited control of a battleship and through the excitement of the battle they learn a few thing like locking targets and shooting. making things blow up. whatever it may be, as long as it puts them on the edge of their seat craving more."

1/31/2015,you mean those changes which have made the game even more stagnant than it was before?those changes which were supposed to have increased conflict but only resulted in coalitions becoming even more entrenched?
1/31/2015,i that case...what is your view on the:- coming corp and alliance revamp- coming sov changes
1/31/2015,"just for reference, the csm does have this.backed by the nda. (which is a contract, with not insubstantial penalties for breaking it)"
1/31/2015,who knew this was a rule.
1/31/2015,"i'm guessing you are talking about pheobe and the jump fatigue mechanics. what need to be understood is the situation in null in regards to coalitions is it is not just power projection, but the way sov works that is keeping things slow in regards to change. what we currently have is the dominion sov, which is actually an incomplete version of what was intended. dominion sov requires an unholy amount of structure grinding to accomplish anything. factor in instant structure damage notifications and any small group will have a tough time taking any sov from a coalition before they are able to sound the horn of gondor and everyone showing up.my hope is that the new sov changes will be the opposite of soul crushing. i believe taking and defending sov should be mostly automatic and based around enjoyable activities. for a good while there has been a steady flow of ideas from the players on what these activities could be. perhaps the sov in addition to a completely revamped pos feature would mean those select few who do logistics for hundreds and in some cases, thousands of players in their alliance no longer meant they were having to do things that murder their jump fatigue.so when you combine a good sov system with the jump fatigue (which has many ways to adjust), that is when you will see the idea of a coalition like we see now become obsolete. imagine your alliance having enough content for itself and no longer requiring 30,000 other players from dozens of other alliance to be able to hold a region or two? only having to travel a handful of jumps to reach the front line.there is still of course addressing the issue of industry related activities in null. having to depend on shipping in so much from jita is not good.which is why it is important to make sure those on the csm are very keen about these issues and help guide ccp towards these things to help the players enjoy the game more. i strongly believe i am one of those candidates who should be on the csm. i understand you have a mandate from up high to vote a specific way, but if you take a moment and think about your game play and what is best for it. i look forward to your vote."
1/31/2015,"it is important for corp and alliance leadership not to be bogged down with arbitrary ui to do the most basic things needed. which is something ccp are already neck deep in changing from my understanding. a ceo, director, logistics manager, as well as many other highly important roles to make a corp/alliance function should not require them to spend eons performing those tasks. they need to have a good amount of time to fly around and pew pew someone's face if they want. basically they need to have fun too. filling one of these roles is challenging enough as it is. don't shackle them with unintuitive user interface as well.i explain a bit on my view for the coming sov changes and what i hope they will mean in the post above this reply."
1/31/2015,"just want to point out i am happy such a thing exists and will gladly sign it. i work in the film industry and nda is widely in place to protect a lot of things. from start to finish, people work extremely hard to present a film that (hopefully) is enjoyable for the target audience. my daily life is blanketed with nda related stuff. it is nothing new for me."
1/31/2015,"+1flown with marlona on a handful of occassions since meeting back in 07-08. he is a damn good pvper, content creator, and always been vocal about his thoughts on current meta (much of which has been good/constructive criticism).also he was the first pers"
1/31/2015,is it opposite day where you are?more has happened since the phoebe changes were announced than in the 9 months before them. they are literally the best thing that ccp has ever done.and i can tell you as a matter of fact that marlona contributed to making them happen.
1/31/2015,"can you elaborate on this a bit? i seem to recall a statement not long ago that was ratified by literally every major 0.0 alliance leader expressing dissatisfaction with the state of 0.0 and the need for change.post phoebe- every major power bloc has shrank its holdings and the size of its afk rental empire except your own alliance, which has doubled down on its holdings and collected even more rental property to become the largest afk isk generation operation in the history of eve."
