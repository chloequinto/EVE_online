1/1/2014,"great idea, 10 out of ******* 10, while we are at it why don't we ban anything larger than a cruiser so the dumb highsec carebears don't get to do 4/10 sites and be able to take down someone elses pos.why dont we just make all space under .05 into null, and remove concord"
1/1/2014,"so one gets a supplementary force of drones and yet gets a extra slot while the one with the supplementary force of guns and gets 1 less.consider also the instant damage of guns [less for missiles and rockets of course] compared to drones which a lot of the time have to travel to range of their target. add also the range of missile and turret damage rigs while drone boats have none.regarding ammo i think that ammo can indeed be used to engage different class sizes. you switch to void, in a small ship to engage cruisers and above while null/antimatter is for small stuff."
1/1/2014,"it sounds like you want a more open 'court' system. this has failed terribly in real life ( in ca ans us ), and i can't imagine if you asked the internet to play jury!i very much doubt that gm's go around with a ban hammer and start swinging at anything that moves. they likely have proof and just cause however if they start revealing how they ban people then the ones being banned will know how to avoid / fight it. this is how our real life system got so messed.i feel bad f you got banned and are 100% in the clear, i say fight it, go to the csm members directly, e-mail ccp directly, but do not put it up here! even if you had the best and most 'clean' evidence of your actions, once it goes public ccp cannot reverse it!! it sets a precedence for others to follow and soon the system if flooded with players who did something stupid, got banned but can follow formula a-b-c to try and get the ban reversed."
1/1/2014,"yes gm's can arrive at different conclusions. but then you can always ask to escalate the petition to a senior gm, if you feel the decision was wrong or unjust.but i disagree with allowing the discussion of gm actions on the forum, in any way.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
1/1/2014,"it's a basic rule for internet forum: admin/gm/etc decisdion are not a topic for pubblic discussion.when not so (i think anyone with experiense in sites/forum managment could confirm this) the whole forum is floodded with circular, self-referential discussions damaging the real forum topics and purpose."
1/1/2014,"1. wrong, the titan aoe doomsday was removed because it provided an insurmountable wall to any large fleet. 2 titans on a gate and no fc would dare jump in, or cyno in, or even get on grid with. if your premise were true, smartbombs would be removed as well as stealth bomber bombs. 2. that's war, things change. i actually like this proposal to a certain degree. the current line on caldari dreads is ""get a real dread"" perhaps if the caldari created a smartbomb effect on detonation, this would become a viable counter to the bootcat drone assist psudo exploit and return a dread to a viable fleet participant instead of a source for capital components for other ships."

1/2/2014,"both of you have limited experiences with what can do.as pointed out by my post, the bomber doesn't have ""niches""; we bring it along for every gank because the insta-point is uncounterable.any ship with a flight of light drones _can_ get rid of a solo stealth bomber, but i've still killed plenty of battlecruisers with one to three .there is a world outside blopsing. we fly bombers all the time without recons. even if they're glass cannons, the cost of the is just too low for what they're ganking. there's no risk to bringing a covops frig that craps out damage. the fact that it guarantees that you will point your target makes it even better.while most kills show that the rats have dealt the most damage, the ratting ships tend to be at nearly full hp - otherwise, they wouldn't be effective ratting ships. work because the ratting ships have no buffer and can't rep the burst damage.utter rubbish, you say? as you can see, the engagement profile is just too wide."
1/2/2014,"what a terrible terrible idea.boils down to ""lets force people out of hi-sec in order to make them play the game how i want them to play""op has not given this any thought whatsoever about how this would affect eve as a whole.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
1/2/2014,"which drone boat ""needs"" another slot? seriously, lets compare the ships you just listed: algos - 12catalyst - 13-- algos is already the highset damage dessie in the game, and it has range over the catalyst. myrmidon - 16brutix - 17--- both of these are very powerful ships on par with each other. do you really think the myrm needs an extra highslot to be competitive? arbitrator - 13omen - 14--- granted, these are different types of cruisers, but the arby can easily compete here without need for another highslot! dominix -18hyperion - 19--- again, the domi is very potent compared to the hyperion and/or mega. it doesn't need another highslot, and giving it one is too much. none of the listed ""short-slotted"" ships are hurting in the metagame, despite being short one slot. this is because drone boats are very versatile, and very powerful. why do they need that extra slot?"

1/2/2014,what actions did isd ezwal take that show a lack of respect ?
1/2/2014,"yes but you can still buy the items. so instead of setting up a proper donate section on static site for donation with the isk values for the stuff your doing for people. you went and created a site as if you are selling them for real money. you added a cost of 10$ per item and a shopping cart. so how will ccp know your not actually getting real money for this?stating that you don't take real money on a site that makes it available in any event means what you stated on the landing page means nothing. your playing in a really grey area and in this case i would say you are in the wrong. do it properly with a static site adding a paypal donate function to it. what you are doing via myshopify is extremely questionable.donating it to eve radio is moot... you could have just adding the donation link from eve radio to your site but did not.notice how easy it is for me to poke holes in everything you have done there. i like what your offering.. i just think your doing it wrong. with these kind of these of things there should be no ""yes, but what about this"" kind of questions."

1/3/2014,"apply neut. use warrior iis. stealth bomber is dead. you can't get more than 3000 ehp out of them.*sigh*as anyone could with one or three assault frigates. your point?so you found another niche for it then? congrats. but that is more a testament to your skill and the lack of it in most other players than the ship itself. i personally have never had issues swatting away in large ships in low-sec and have torn them apart using small ships.and judging the effectiveness of a ship based on how well they kill gimped min/max-fits that carebears use is about as good a barometer for ""overpowered"" as using a lollipop to find tornados (hint: it isn't).ratting/anomaly ships that have been specifically designed to kill a certain type of npc will die to anything else... just happen to be better than most at it (because of cloaking).tell you what... take a trip down to low-sec and start hunting the native pvpers down there in your (using the same tactics as you are now). come back after a bit and then tell me they are overpowered."
1/3/2014,"why is the stealth bomber in neut range?assault frigates either don't have the range to avoid neuts or don't do the damage to take down battleships.they're also not cloaky, so it's much harder to gank things in them.again, my point here is that they're good at too many things. i'm saying that the engagement profile is too wide, not that they fulfill their ""niche"" too well.we use it to hunt _everything_ because regardless of your fleet, the stealth bomber is the only one that can guarantee point since it has no decloak delay. a gank fleet is always better with a stealth bomber."
1/3/2014,"you see in those kills you linked, 90% are kills against non combat targets (industrials, pods, exploration frigates, mobile depots...). against targets able to fight back are more the loss. there's also some loss against venture."
1/3/2014,"raylu with al l due respect, those links are pretty irrelevant. i believe shah and the others have answered most of your points well."
1/3/2014,"this.you're not ""fighting a wide range of targets."" you are shooting things that have limited to no capacity to fight back. again... if cloaking was not a factor then any other tech 2 frigate could pull off the same trick... or more."
1/3/2014,"we're getting a bit off-topic here. i can't really prove the viability of a ship for solo since there are too many factors in those sorts of engagements.regardless of whether solo are a thing, are still too generally useful at other things.and if all the other things the stealth bomber engaged couldn't be engaged by a stealth bomber, i wouldn't be here complaining. you will note that one of my suggestions was to remove the cloak and just make it a ""bomber""."
1/3/2014,ugh...ok...and we're done here.

1/3/2014,"the just released csm8 minutes have some fascinating stuff in them, but most of which as a relatively new player i am unqualified to even touch on. however, one area i think i am qualified to comment on is the concept of the ""social wall"" that was discussed with dr. eyjog:the basic idea is that new players coming into the game who do not discover the social aspects, or who do not engage with it, will quickly leave the game. essentially, mining and shooting little red crosses or hauling stuff around gets boring, fast, in the absence of a social interaction to make it meaningful.i can attest to that: i quickly figured out that mining in hisec was pretty boring, hauling stuff only a bit less so, and ratting only a tiny bit less than that. my thought process was something like, ""wow, what a gorgeous, detailed interesting game""...but like a gorgeous wedding cake that taste bland and cardboard-y. i hadn't gotten to the tasty part, which was joining a corp, interacting with other players, and having ""fun"".so, i think if i had not joined a player corp, i would have run smack into the social wall, and eve would have remained a mildly interesting curiosity, but nothing more.this brings us to the title of this post- overcoming that social wall. the minutes offered a suggestion of mentors, but i don't think that's going to be viable. apparently, neither did the csm/ccp.rather, i suggest a more radical solution- limit new players to 1 month of npc corp membership. i think those who find eve is totally unsuitable for them will not renew the subscription, whereas those who are at least somewhat engaged will, and at the end of their subscription they will be informed that the school (republic university, war college, etc) has ""graduated"" them, and they have to get a job- a menu box containing a choice of interests (pvp, exploration, mining, fleet ops, salvage, pi) would then open up, and the characters would be transferred to a player corp which has agreed to accept new applicants from the system. at that point, a degree of mentoring takes over- ""welcome to acme mining"" messages and the opportunity for the corp members to mentor/train/woo their draftees. corps who do well at it will thrive, those who don't will lose the character to other corps, or drive them from the game altogether (which, while unfortunate, is likely what will happen to people who don't overcome the social wall anyway).for players who decide they need to be in an npc corp due to wardecs and such- you can always go back to ""graduate school"" after, say 2-3 months in the game. or, alternatively, join npc corps that are not default new-player corps.i realize this is a rather radical change, but i think it's worth considering.the minutes also briefly touched on the issue of the gender disparity. i've given that a bit of thought, and while i don't have any really good answers, one thing i think needs to be considered is:""what are female players doing in the game?"".from my (admittedly limited) experience, it seems like the females tend to congregate in carebear corps- salvaging, mining, hauling, pi as opposed to pvp corps. marketing these activities might bear ccp some fruit. ""be an elven warrior princess"" seems to attract women to games like wow, so ""be a rich, powerful, femme fatal starship pilot"" might attract women to eve."
1/3/2014,"while i agree with your sentiments and do not doubt the sincerity behind your idea there is one critical flaw that i must point out....you can't force players to do anything.early mmos discovered this early on. you simply cannot engineer a situation to force people to behave a certain way (in this case, to be social). they will simply do whatever they want to do and work around the rules to support that objective.hell... there are a plethora of cases right here in eve that prove this point.the real trick is to convince them that performing a certain action (see: being more sociable) is in their interest. and given that most people who play video games tend to be rather stubborn you need a rather extreme way to convince them(example: the confusing gameplay of eve).plus... this would be a ""boon"" for spies."
1/3/2014,"counter proposal.how about instead of ccp using the stick to drive players where they want them to go, we let fellow players use the carrot.how about a list of all new characters that ceo's and directors can access. that way we, the players, can reach out to these newbies before they ever strike that social wall.keep in mind i'm still a bit of a newbie myself and was fortunate that a veteran reached out to me and brought me into bni, so this proposal may be riddled with holes, but from my perspective it seems like a good idea."
1/3/2014,missions where you fly into the structures.so it looks more like the inside of stations. (( ship spinning while moving? brilliant! ))where player v.s. npc bumps do damage.(( see more ships and less x's from the npc's as they are trying to ram you ))mixed with strip poker in station with bars that serve drinks that give 30 min 1% buffs. (( in low sec only! ))followed by raising npc corporation taxes to 13% would have far more impact on player retaining and social interaction.also: bring back the juke box we need it next to the poker table!
1/3/2014,"i would counter that the nature of games always force players to do something. the issue is how well, how subtly they do it, how extensively, and how the players react to it.but, you have a point- i honestly do not know if this is something that's too over-the-top, or could be modified/nerfed in some way. i would think ccp would have to take a cold, hard look at their data and decide whether they don't have much to lose, in that players who don't get into corps early on will leave the game vs. too-much-stick-not-enough-carrot.also, i am coming at this from a non-mmo player's perspective. so i get that more veteran mmo players may have different opinions.but, i don't see the boon for spies, so much. if you're a spy-paranoid corp, don't opt into accepting new players. spies would be randomly dropped into one of several corps that meets whatever interest they clicked- so they'd probably be better off leaving right away and joining their target corp...which is basically the current status quo."
1/3/2014,"agreed; the best solution from ccp's end is definitely going to look at providing more tools for established players to reach out to newbies, rather than demanding that the newbies find a place for themselves on their own. i've talked about this before; reposting the suggestion i made last time there was a thread up about this..."
1/3/2014,"in an open sandbox pvp game should not be scripted (expecting a certain outcome) or directly influenced (telling capsuleers which path to take) by ccp anymore.when a ""live event"" is taking place it should encourage the organisational skills of the new eden denizens.a live event should be a cumulating results of players interacting with each other in an open environment coolthe live event that will take place should be a result of an avalanche of intrigue, role playing and use of the meta game.where the team should not regulate the conditions but only monitor it's progress, and use social media to incite it.to start such an avalanche that might or might not result in a player base created live event ccp should rethink it's strategy on how to start one with the help of the csm or cpm even to involve the dust side of new eden.what does the csm think of the use of by ccp more as an eve online promotional tool for expansions or gaming conventions and less as persistent pve/pvp content for it's current costumers ?"
1/3/2014,"not a fan of the wow analogy, but what's so bad about ""instant pvp""? i thought this game was about making your own fun and play style?also, calling it ""instant wow style pvp"" seems like an exaggeration and a reach for attention."
1/3/2014,"yep.plus, drone boats get a much larger drone bay to store ""spares"" and other types of drones that can do different things (e.g. my dominix can use sentries... then heavies... then lights... and finally light ecm drones with plenty of room for spares! on the other hand, my megathron is limited to using only 3 heavy/sentry drones... or 5 mediums with a backup of lights).i have considered it and counter with drones requiring no cpu, powergrid, or capacitor power from the ""mothership"" itself. there are also sentry drones for ranged tactics (they apply their damage just like a turret does).i will agree though that more diverse options in drone rigs and implants are needed. assuming we are using a light electron blaster for reference... switching to void ammo from faction antimatter would be akin to swapping an acolyte for a hobgoblin. your damage goes up a bit... but you are still technically using a ""light"" weapon.a vexor can use medium and light drones with equal proficiency. that would be akin to a thorax being able to switch between light electron blasters and heavy electron blasters at will and apply its hull bonuses to both."
1/3/2014,"i think that would be incredibly fair. i agree completely with a and b. any insight would be helpful. i get the feeling that ultimately the gms are fair and punishments are uniform. but an occasional blog like this would help players understand that the gms are in fact out there, being uniform and fair. even quarterly would be sufficient if monthly would be too much of a burden."

1/4/2014,"want to change eve to a larger sandbox? simple (in theory) get rid of the gates, period. no more bubbles! for bath, anyway. i have to agree with the no cynos in wh's too.ch"
1/4/2014,cynos aren't coming to w-space. i said that to illustrate a point.
1/4/2014,"is becoming an overloaded system. even with the dedicated node player numbers have been reaching 2.5k which is causing an unreasonable amount of lag while in system, especially while in or around 4-4.i have 2 simple suggestions to help with this.1. fixed grid around 4-4 station.players drag out the grid on 4-4, causing a great deal of lag on undock, fix the grid to a lower than normal range, say 200klm to reduce the 'grid-load' lag when undocking.there is an existing case for something like this with gm's removing excessive cans on gate camps due to the additional lag it causes when players jump in. 2. logoff timer for . reduce the sever load by applying an inactivity logoff timer in that system.a reasonable length of time, perhaps 1 hour, of inactivity will result in you being disconnected from the server, reducing load on that node. i would imagine the system numbers would be reduced considerably by this feature."
1/4/2014,"i actually have no real problem with the idea of the training implants to supplement the training program. obviously each system has to have a way of levelling up a character and while there could be arguments made for the different methodologies, this one isn't so bad. the opportunity to speed up one's training by purchasing said implants is fine along with the risk associated with losing them. i don't think this system has ever really been responsible for losing clients ( as a sole reason ) but perhaps in association with both the steep learning curve and the fact that new pilots are pretty much left to their own devices once in game, combine to overwhelm those too used to being coddled, spoon-fed and otherwise not used to facing a challenge.since it's unlikely that the method of character advancement is to change in any grandiose way, i would suggest two things:first, if you look at what the implants are supposed to do, raise certain attributes of mental acuity, then why can't these same bonuses work towards the character's activities as well. if you were to give any real person such a boost to perception, he's naturally become better at spotting movement, etc. boost intelligence, he'd become smarter and so on. so why shouldn't each character no be able to apply these gains in attributes to the ships, mods, rigs and/or activities he/she's involved with?makes sense, no? let's say a character would gain a 1% advantage for each level implant he puts in - and this would apply universally across all items that require that implant's attribute adjustment in some way or other yet to be determined.also, you'd tie the hardwiring to these implants too. buy a l1 implant and you can plug in a l2 hardwire and so on up to a l5 implant for a l6 hardwire.second, how about making them plug and play? do away with the remap and you plug in what you want when you want it.why not? in a sandbox we're supposed to be determining our own future anyway, why not remove this stumbling block. training time still takes the time it does.we do it with ships, mods, subsystems, etc. anyway.setting up a whole new skill system for making them so they become player made sounds like a good idea too.anyway, a couple ideas to put out there. good discussions here.cheers!"

1/5/2014,"why is an afk cloaked player of any concern to you? you're in no danger whatsoever.let's be honest here. your chief concern is that you're unable to tell the difference between an afk cloaked player and a non-afk cloaked player, which is what causes your anxiety. when you say you want a method for dealing with afk cloaky players, you really just want a method for telling the difference between afk and non afk. so far no one has come up with a reasonable compromise between players who lurk around a system cloaked and players who fear getting ganked."
1/5/2014,"and if such a tool was implemented, then you can simply go dock up, go afk, and return once in a while to see if the cloaky ship is ""afk"" or not. then isn't that pretty much the same thing in reverse? now we're giving the one hiding with no intention to engage a tool to further be able to hide. at least the cloaky will attack by whatever means."

1/6/2014,"inb4 thread locked / posts deleted.also, note the difference between ewarp and regular warping. ewarp only involves either logging in or out. if you're in a capital ship or something, and you somehow get bumped repeatedly on logging into the game, and die before you can act; that's an exploit. on the other end, if you're trying to log out, and you've got an aggression timer or something that stops you from safe logging, and then you also have something big and clunky in your way like a pos that stops you from warping off to a random safe, that's your own fault.even so, that doesn't follow from what was posted regarding the situation, since you were aligning to a gate, not a random safe. the implication is that you got caught warping away from a pos, and died shortly thereafter. which sucks, sure, but whining about it on the forums doesn't help your case, especially not while breaking the rules about it."

1/7/2014,"its not implied by my statements because thats not what happened. ""what happened"" is stated in the original post.the removed content was proof that it is an intended game mechanic that i think should be changed."
1/7/2014,"okay, then i maintain that the sequence of events, as you've presented them, is incoherent.emergency warp, again, only triggers on logon and logoff. if you didn't login to an ewarp (in which you somehow got caught?), you wouldn't have been online for the ewarp. if you logged off for an ewarp, then it's your own fault if there was someone in position to catch you (because you didn't safelog). either way, that wouldn't have led to the sequence of events you described, which leads me to conclude that you're using the term 'emergency warp' incorrectly."
1/7/2014,"pretty much this.....you don't ewarp unless you log off / disconnect. i suppose if you had an alt monitoring the character who logged off, you could watch them get stuck on a gate attempted to ewarp. is this what happened? or did you log off and log immediately back in to discover your ship attempting to ewarp while stuck on the gate? this is akin to what happens to many highsec freighters that attempt to log out to save themselves from getting suicide ganked. the gankers the just bump the ship to prevent it from ewarping out, and give it an aggro timer with a noobship until they get their gank squad together for the gank. note: if you initiated warp somewhere, bounced off the gate as you aligned to your destination, and were thereby unable to get to safety before getting tackled, this isn't called an ewarp. furthermore, this warp could be canceled by hitting ctrl+space."

1/8/2014,"as stated several times in this thread, i am not opposed to that either, however to avoid obvious abuses and level the playing field another form of intelligence gathering needs to be implemented as well. the ability to automate d scan similar to what you do when you first enter a system for instance. that is only one example but there are many good ideas on the subject."
1/8/2014,there really doesn't. please show us the experience you have flying bombers/cov ops on this or whatever alt you may have because right now all i see is a renter complaining about not being safe during his farming.
1/8/2014,"from what i can gather his domi arrived at the pos.33 seconds later a hostile engaged his ship, while he was aligning to the gate. he used his mjd, moved out of tackle range and got to the gate.he jumped into the next system 2 minutes 57 seconds after that first engagement, where he was tackled and killed.so at what point was he stuck?he was either trying to get away from them and warped to the pos, or he logged out and in there. but as the time he arrived to when he was first engaged at the pos is only 33 seconds, it's hard to fathom what he was doing. he may have been running and tried to log, then realised he had a timer that meant his ship wouldn't disappear.who knows? well he does, but he's rather vague about it all. one thing we know for sure, he does whine a great deal.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
1/8/2014,"actually i am reading a sci-fi novel dealing with a huge spaceship-battle. there also the time it is mentioned that the fight lasts. thats how i got the idea of slowing down eve<U+FFFD>s battlespeed. at the moment the time period of the battle seems like in an egoshooter. eve is no egoshooter, is it? we move extremly huge ships. how is it poostble to destroy or get destroyed in miliseconds. there is no time to call friends for help like it is shown in the trailers. the only sense is to contact them for revenge not for help. this would raise the gaming experience, wouldn<U+FFFD>t it?on sisi, i tried flying capitals (moros). those are hard to destroy. what gives you enough time to call for help and turn the combat. the amount of fun is immense and you get addicted to pvp.preparing your fitting for 2 hours getting killed in 30sec is not that fun. i think, having time to understand what<U+FFFD>s going on in the fight would animate a lot more people to do pvp.i hope you understand what i mean and think about my suggestion.thx k"

1/8/2014,"being a resident of null sec is the only place i like to play the game. ccp wanted industry to be enhanced in nullsec but put asteroid sights on the scanner window for easy access to pirates. then interceptors warp faster while mining barges get into warp slower. not to mention the larger ships that do pve being slower to get to a safe spot. result is less industry and fewer pve players.rebalancing was conceived under the idea of bringing new players a fair chance to continue to play but in fact it is reducing the number of older players that have had their joy taken out of the game.please do not renew my membership. several members of our corp are not renewing either. this ""rebalancing"" has taken the fun of a great game. well done fozzy !put industry back into nullsec and enough with fern tactics"

1/9/2014,a couple of weeks ago we had a fight with our nados vs some russian ravens over a pos. they outnumbered us.they maintained fire on our fc while our fc called for frequent target switches until we had killed enough logi to break the ravens. all the time keeping a bubble on their triaged carrier. it was one of the most enjoyable fights ever so that would support the op. however in fact op is wrong and you are correct. it is the rapidly changing battlefield that makes eve pvp hard and fun. it would be too easy to make logistics op in small scale fights if any more buffer was given to ships. still those fights where nothing will break without good fleet coordination and clever switching are still to be treasured.money at its root is a form of rationing. when the richest 85 people have as much wealth as the poorest 3.5 billion (50% of humanity) it is clear where the source of poverty is.

1/9/2014,"the responses to this thread aren't terribly constructive because, well, the op wasn't terribly well thought out.psyue even hinted at the answer, but didn't realise the significance. ""since you can't really make a profit on invention or manufacturing (due to costs of materials) why bother having the skills?"" if a project isn't profitable, players won't take part in it. when players stop taking part in it, supply falls. when supply falls, (owing to the supply/demand mantra), prices rise. when prices rise such that the item becomes profitable again, players begin menufacturing again.as always, the complaints regarding an activity being too difficult does not lie in a flaw in the game, it lies in a flaw in the player. psyue has reacted too slowly to new profitable deals, doesn't react in time when deals become unprofitable and generally expects too much for very little effort. he's losing out because other players sare simply doing a better job than him, end of story."

1/11/2014,"no, they don't. that's all handled by transgaming as part of the maintenance of the mac eve client. major production changes that occur that need changes to cider to run are handled by transgaming, all other elements that involve directx or win32 binaries are supported by the cider engine or handled by transgaming's bug division. this was all detailed here.it is more cost-effective as ccp doesn't have to devote developer resources on their part to maintaining the mac client. instead, they release to transgaming and let transgaming handle the mac build concurrent to the development of the windows version. in the end, this saves ccp the costs of a single mac division and investing in a separate build environment for the mac client, plus the usual hoo-dads of translating directx and the win32 api to a non-native system. with a pure wine distribution, ccp would lose the farmed-out aspect of the code, would have to significantly invest in developing a stable wine-based distribution system, and would then lose hundreds of man hours that could be more effectively used to just developing the game normally."

1/12/2014,"ccp would probably need to do some vetting of the corps that get access to newbie npc corps to make sure they are newbie friendly corps. instead of corps just inflating their member count for taxes, or corps that will take anyone but don't provide the help that new players need."

1/13/2014,"after having read through this post and all the links a situation with bumping does need to be evaluated by ccp.actual event: you load your charon with 923,000 m3 of material to transport to hek. along the way you exit a gate and are singled out by a bumper. for the next 45 minutes (while you are trying to escape) the bumper continues to hold you from going to warp. since a charon can not be fit, and has such a great top speed it is easy to see where this is going. the bumper receives no damage to his ship and is not flagged for this activity. when the gank crew arrives you die. you can not get away, go to another location etc. you would like to do that very thing. so in the end you loose the 1.6 billion isk ship and the 4.5 billion isk collateral for the load.bumping had been in the game for a long time however it is now being used instead of a trigger. this is also very wide spread and spreading wider. i can see a day when no one will use capital freighters to move material. you have an economist on staff, ask him the effect on the eve economy when goods are no longer transported. once freighters are extinct the industrials will be next and they don't need as many in the gank squad to kill it. so the high points are: bumping to keep a slow, defenseless ship in high sec from warping. no concord attention. miners and freighters classed together (totally different activities)game mechanics and/or recognizing the aggression exhibited need a serious look."
1/13/2014,omg this thread again... please ccp do it! for 48 hours only enable suspect flag for bumping. so maybe they'll get the point.
1/13/2014,"45 minutes. that's a long time. if this is such a widespread problem, you'd think that freighter pilots would start hiring escorts to protect them. or, alternately, that they'd have guys on-call in their corp/alliance to come bail them out when they get caught. heck, if you're 'actively trying to escape' during that time, you'd probably have time to hire in-game mercenaries to come save you. but any of that would require you to interact with other players, so i can see where it holds a difficulty for you.given that, as a freighter pilot, you probably could use someone to web you anyways, it's really not much of a stretch to have that same guy fit for suicide ganking, so that in an emergency, he can trade himself for a bumper to let you escape a trap."

1/14/2014,"i found your problem.if you were dumb enough to carry that much in a freighter, you deserve what you got."
1/14/2014,"firstly, notice that my point was specifically in regards to the implausible situation of a bumper holding a freighter in place for 45 minutes. if you can't figure out some way to deal with a little bumpy frigate in that amount of time, you deserve what's coming to you. obviously, if you're alone in space unable to flee and the gank squad is already on top of your defenceless freighter, your losing mistake was made a long time ago... but the story is different if you're caught by an opportunistic bumper who doesn't have a gank squad present, and is trying to call one in to deal with you. much like with a tackled capital, that is a window of time in which it is possible to respond.secondly... one-shot alpha? freighter? usually not, no. sure, there is a number/composition of ships which can pull off the feat, but that tends to be a losing proposition (remember, gankers rely on that window of time between initial aggression and concord's arrival to kill harder targets). at the very least, you could pre-summon concord (read, have your buddy shoot their bumper, hopefully killing him, before dying to concord in turn), which changes the ganking equation pretty unfavorably, since with concord on the field, gankers will more or less instantly die after aggressing. sure, it's possible that they brought enough dps to win anyways, but the numbers are worse than even a gank in 1.0; not perfect protection, but if you've been at all sensible with your cargo value, you've just guaranteed a loss to the gankers."
1/14/2014,"look, since the number of subscribers in eve has been dropping off dramatically, i thought that what eve really needs is a real hook to reel in the new players. the best i could come up with is a new take on your first 5 minutes of eve. and then i looked into the other games i play to build up my character. well, how about a harsh take on reality with a game like need for speed: underground? example:- player n just clicked the [ok] button on character selection.- player n is whisked away to a random spot in nullsec (not a part of the full tranquility server so no other players in the system with you), armed with a battleship, and the ever-present aura guiding with tutorials. (i.e. warp off station, go to sun, go to planet, dock at station, join fleet.)- player n joins fleet (npcs), and is greeted by (scripted) greetings and rowdy banter typical to their chosen faction. aura guiding on ins and outs of what your ship is, what fittings/rigs are and such. player n finally gets through the last tutorial and fleet chat starts flashing, opening it, there's a convo about an enemy fleet approaching.- a fleet member tells everyone to undock, aura guides player n to undock.- a fleet member tells everyone to warp to gate and engage hostiles, once again aura guides player n to activate modules to help with tanking explaining a difference in shield, armor, and hull tanking.- coming out of warp, it's pure devastation. there's wrecks everywhere, heavy losses on both sides. aura is helping slightly: aim at this target, click or use a button for this module. once player n scores a kill (scripted), the hostiles engage player n and succeeds in not only killing his ship, but podding him as well.- clone activation: aura appears during the black screen with a tutorial about clones, skills, and various other tips on what to do. player n upon reaching the end of this tutorial, has to purchase his first alpha clone, as well as purchasing (on aura's market) a noobship (that's all the money they have for it) and various fittings like mining lasers and shield boosters and skillbooks are still given freely through tutorials.what do you think?oderint, dum metuant. let them hate, so long as they fear. -accius"
1/14/2014,brilliant suggestion
1/14/2014,"there's also the whole problem of, ""well, how *do* you get the player in a bs when newbies don't start with all that?"" easy: you start them with all that. pod them back to station, and they've lost it all. what's that, if you undock in an unupgraded clone you lose skillpoints? good to know thanks tutorial.basically this would teach a lot of the really niche parts of pvp all in one go, using the traditional rpg trope of ""give the player a lot of power, then take it away"" (see: assassin's creed, iirc the beginning of mass effect 2, others). people want to get it back, so boom, you've already got an idea of progress and progression. you can still even be a new capsuleer, woken up specifically for that battle when suddenly oops you get sent back to your newbie institution to relearn some things because of pod death."
1/14/2014,i like and ali's suggestion except there has to be a way to keep the fool from running away from the podding so he can keep the skill list.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>
1/14/2014,"what's that? some sort of bubble that spits out of a ship, preventing warp? :d"
1/14/2014,"i saw your comment on the post on the mittani. i love it, its an instant hook and you would learn so much more. the main advertising of eve is the awesome fleet fights. if people come to eve because of the market or some of the other niche stuff they have heard about they are already hooked. its the people that ccp gets from the adverts that we need to convince.capsuleers have to graduate from a school before they can be qualified to step in a pod. i'm almost imagining a final exam type deal. this way we don't have to worry about podding/getting out of the simulation/anything else. when they start they are given the skills to fly the ships needed. when they are done, they go back to normal (and aura tells them this)in a fleet fight almost every aspect of the game comes into play. you have logi boats, ecm, cap warfare, etc. have a npc logi rep the player up from low armor/shield. use a frigate neutralizer to cap the hell out of the player until he is useless - unable to hit the small frigate with his large guns. then a pair of npc destroyers can come in and save him. the tutorial should be about establishing relationships between things. big vs small, capacitor and mods, ecm vs dps etc. the player doesn't need to know everything about these things by the end of the tutorial. he merely needs to know that they exist. that cap warfare is a thing, logistics can save a ship, ecm is a ***** and big guns can't shoot small targets. a tutorial like this will emphasize what can be gained from flying with other people. how different ship types can compliment each other and friends can come in and save the day. another thing to add though - i think a plug to eve university is needed in game. yes its favoring a group of players, get over it. the amount of help they will be able to give is significantly more than they are ever going to get from the starter corp and help channel."
1/14/2014,"not a problem if it's a random spot in nullsec. all you need is a dictor.hey, they can learn about bubbles, too! i love this idea.[edit: ninja'd by csm.]"

1/14/2014,"yeah, here it is:"
1/14/2014,"wow, that is some serious trial by fire.but this fleet thing, would it be like an npc fleet? i mean, as much as i would like it to be a player fleet, its unlikely going to be that. how would aura know ""undock now"", ""warp to xxxx"", ""bridge via titan"".i mean, it would be one thing if it a weekly thing planned ahead by ccp."
1/14/2014,"it'd be an npc fleet, and aura would know because the entire thing was scripted. sure, it wouldn't be as amazing as a real thing, but if it's the first thing the player sees, the sense of bigness would still be there.two step, that's awesome."
1/14/2014,"many games actually try this ""fast forward"" introduction but its easy to get it wrong esp in complex games. to pick an example, the introduction chapter of witcher 2 where you start with fairly high skills got the most criticism."
1/14/2014,don't allow people to skip the mission on their first character. every other character can skip it. want to skip it on a new account? create a throwaway character. biomass it. you can now skip it.
1/14/2014,"what makes those games failures?edit: if it's not clear, i say this not because i'm questioning your assessment or can't use google, but just because it's sometimes useful to think about what parts of a thing work and what don't by looking at other examples."

1/15/2014,i like the idea. no sec status restriction needs to apply. why would it matter what the toons sec status is? i didnt expect to play past the 21 day trial so i just typed my gamer tag as one word.lazy and stuff.
1/15/2014,"although i am generally against this in principle, i'm not above making suggestions so if it does happen, its a bit more palatable one requirement to me would be that any past names appear on your profile (say, in a clear colour between where your character name and your titles appear), and that the old name is still linked to your character (so for example, any eve gate search of your old name (or even something close to it) would bring up your new character name as a possible result, and no-one else can ever reuse the name). i might even argue that a symbol appear against your name in any chat channel windows (in particular local), that signifies you are known by other names, so more cautious people can be warned it might be worth checking your profile to make sure you aren't known to them in another form - although, depending how easy/cheap this service would be to use, this might be pointless if a large percentage of pilots use it (if half the pilots in the local window in any given system is showing the icon, people will stop taking it as a warning, so rendering in pointless)."
1/15/2014,"create an accountlog in""warning friendly fleet is engaging hostiles...""""please open your inventory and select a ship.""""you have selected a battleship, please open your inventory and right click on the modules and select fit to ship.""""your ship is fitted, please click undock""""on the right you have your overview, please select the cynosoral field""""in the window above that, please press warp to""....etc etc""please click on the [npc titan] and select target, then activate your guns by clicking on them""""warning a doomday weapon has been activated""""you are now being attacked """"your ship has been blown up""""oh no, your pod isnt able to get away""""you are no longer able to fly battleships until the skill is trained""mission complete: trial by firedo it, i will make trial accounts just to do that."
1/15/2014,"you could also build into the small ships vs big ships into this too. just have a segment where you have to try and shoot a frigate but can't. a play in like this isn't there to teach the new person everything. its to show the new character that these relationships are there so they can go learn more about them. ship types in a battle, ammo, resistances, optimal and falloff, capacitor warfare, ewar, logistics, cynos, overheating, shield tank vs armor tank. you don't need to say ""this is a falcon, falcon's use ecm, this is what ecm does and how it works."" no! instead the intro can put you through a short jam cycle, point out the ship that is doing it and have you blap it. you don't know how ecm works but you do know it exists which is far better than the average pilot ends up after the tutorial mission."
1/15/2014,"okay, so first things first. i would like to thank members of the csm who have taken time out of their busy schedules to take a look into my mind for a bit, as well as thanks for the comments into the ""behind-the-scenes"" ideas.secondly, i did not realize that the fanbase of both this forum (and mittani's) would suddenly be into this as they have. this idea, and as frank as i can explain, was more of a bit of flow-charting a bit of fan-fiction i'm currently working on added to the idea of new subscribers not finding a reason to stay past their first year.so, what would drive a new player into doing anything other than flying noobships and shooting rocks?it got me thinking, ""why do i eve?"" ( << not a typo)then, ""why should others eve?"" ( << also not a typo)it made me think of every hook that makes me want to play games, but eve's new player startup missions were severely lacking. have you gone back to your roots and tried the newbie missions as a high-skilled player? it's as bad as trying to sit through the entire music video of rebecca black's ""fridays"".what do i find in wow (yes i play, stfu)?the grind is horrible but the storyline is beautiful, as are the landscapes.what do i play borderlands for?once again, the grind is horrible, but the camaraderie with a group is amusing at times.what makes minecraft fun? well... imagination.(...and the grind is horrible) once you get past the big picture, you start seeing this idea start to pester the players who always seem to have the best stance on the topic. half the subscribed players think the other half is cannon fodder waiting to be exploited, but the smaller half have mixed ideas about what to think. some are, ""nullseccers are evil so stay in highsec."" some are ""pirates and scams are terribad, but it'll never happen to me."" and lastly some are, ""as long as i can safely shoot these rocks and make isk, i don't care.""forcing new players into e-uni sounds like a good idea in the long run, but it would require a ""corporation rebalancing"" to take place. you don't believe me? how big can a corporation be? how many players is ccp looking to sign up?a few hundred, no problem. a few thousand? little difficult. tens of thousands? um, things are getting out of hand. a million? please sto- tens of millions?well, we're not wow, so i think trying to break half a million subs should be a main focus. but if eve can somehow ""break the bank"" and we can login to find that there's now 100k+ people on almost all the time, things will perk up. economics will see greater fluctuations. nations (not really alliances anymore) will rise to power or fade from existence. ccp would have to increase their war server shards by 300% for new bouts of combat springing up all over.also, i'm out of good vodka. kool-aid is keeping me going, though.oderint, dum metuant. let them hate, so long as they fear. -accius"
1/15/2014,"this would be fantastic. i cannot put into words just how cool of an introduction to eve this would have been. i was lucky to have friends who could guide me through all the things someone needs to be successful in eve, but what a great way to get a glimmer of what eve is capable of."
1/15/2014,"also, at the end aura should say:""now you felt how real eve looks like. it's up to you to decide whether you want to experience that feeling again, or you would rather spend your eve career as a cowardly highsec carebear whose only purpose is to grind for isk."""
1/15/2014,"i like the general idea, but:don't put a new player in a battleship. a bc or cruiser will do the job, too, and will deter from the idea bigger=better. and teasing him with the ability to fly a bs when he can't speed up skill progress (much) may lead up to frustration."
1/15/2014,awesomesauce idea +1
1/15/2014,"i will try to be constructive. no. after completing the ""new player introduction"" they will find that a battleship is 3-4 months away with fair skills (a ship they should not be trying to get into that fast anyway). stick with a t1 frigate: quick to train into and fairly cheap to replace. also, while i have never done it myself... faction warfare, i am told, is possible and profitable for a 'newish' pilot in a t1."
1/15/2014,"i like the idea, but you should make it a simulation, a training for new pod pilots while their first clone is being prepared. there would be too much stretch from the reality and it could really drive away people by making them think they will go back to a rookie character if they die.also, a lot of people that tried other mmos with personal stories are tired of starting as someone powerful / a hero / someone with a great destiny / etc...so yeah a smiluation would do the trick perfectly.by the way, three points :1- the whole thing of having your original body terminated and waking up in your first clone when you start a character is not exploited at all, whereas it could be an easy and interesting way of introducting people with the harshness of new eden and eve storyline.2- any form of ""epic introduction"" should see a rewamp of the whole tutoriel to ensure that players are not dissapointed by what they see next, and the lack of action they might get while learning stuff.3- there is no need to commit on making the most epic scripted experience possible. just make something realistic that gives a teaser of what is eve one you are not a rookie anymore. more would bring dissapointment and the feeling that ccp is lying to its new subscribers."
1/15/2014,"great idea, but i would not shuffle the person off in a frigate. start them big in a battleship.if you want to get both standards done well, start them in a battleship, when it dies and they are in their pod, do a tiny tutorial about boarding a floating abandoned cruiser or battlecruiser floating on field, and then they can continue the fight a little longer. that way you get both perspectives. you could potentially put a fit ship on contract and make the person buy it (i would do that for the battleship).don't overdo this concept though. its meant as a 10 to 20 minute introduction, not a 3 hour extravaganza. programming that much ai takes time."
1/15/2014,starting them off in a battleship is a terrible idea because then they will want to race for one and will lose it because they lack the skills.
1/15/2014,"the exact story and ships chosen are the kind of design thing that ccp, employing professional designers and having more data, would likely be more able to do.i'm interested still in ways this could fail-- one that came up was the problem where there's a big time to train into the ship you're test-driving. that's a good point-- a lot of times this kind of start ends up taking you to endgame power, which is similar in concept, but those games don't have multiple real months to get to where you're going."
1/15/2014,"since it's a scripted fight, civilian modules could be used to simulate different activities; modules that are effectively useless but work for the intro. the pilot's ship could also be civilian-esque. ccp could easily create a battle cruiser with no pre-reqs but has about 1000 ehp. this could also open up the option of letting a new pilot choose a role for the fight like logistics or tackler.another point of failure would be the real corporations and how to connect to them. new players won't have a clue on how to get connected with the coalitions and null sec alliances. if the tutorial linked to rvb or eve uni, that might help some."
1/15/2014,1
1/15/2014,"i like this concept a lot.i am not sure how is it feasible from technical standpoint. i, but it would be great if something like that was implemented. this scenarios can be also used to teach players about tackling, ewar, logi and all kind of stuff."
1/15/2014,"there is no reason why this fleet that the new player flies in should just go somewhere and die. it could give him/her the tour first, a la oh look a hauler of another faction, let's shoot it, oh noes one of our miners is being attacked by someone or there is this guy in that anomly we have to scan first and each time the fleet almost get that guy and he jumps, you follow and you land in a trap. and each time the new player loses some sp and isk and the ship he or she is flying, forcing the new player to take smaller ships with different tasks.(the last time could be that you fly a tackle so that time he doesn't get away but his friends come and you're no longer flying something that does dps.)but this is really nothing you guys couldn't come up with by yourself, right?"
1/15/2014,"well, has anyone looked at world of warcraft lately?the first races (representing the vanilla & 2nd expansions) were played normally. we can attribute this to eve's first decade, such as showing off player models, factions, and warfare.the third expansion to world of warcraft (and every expansion after) hooked players with characters that went on a ""mini-quest of epic proportions"", basically their first ten levels were a giant epic moving storyline before they entered the ""full world"" of the game. using a ""phasing"" technology, they [blizzard] allowed players on different parts of the mission's line not to interact with each other. (but you could still chat if someone out there was willing to talk.) i mean, you're doing a quest of unbelievable size, the visuals can stay with you long after you're done. we can view this as where ccp would like to go with eve in the second decade. sure, the capsuleers are taking over, but if things in eve are represented by an overhanging cliff on the skills chart, we (not just the nullseccers) are going to need help from new players with a desire to strive for bigger and better but also has actually flown large fleet encounters.why not have both? (remember that one eve sandbox video?) start like that.1 - helping the miner fight off rats brings up a new avenue. a small gang warps in and convos you to join them on patrol.2 - killing the miner brings up a smaller avenue. a pirate gang approaches and invites you to go explore a wormhole with them.3 - warping away brings up a different avenue. an exploration ship contacts you as it warps into your next location. there's money to be made on exploration sites.1 - on patrol, your gang defends space. shoot some rats here, a (npc) frigate cruiser there, new tutorial on gun/ship types and resistances. your gang meets up with other patrols and suddenly something happens that escalates quickly. (asakai?)2 - while in the wormhole, your choices affect what the pirates do, killing others and setting up mobile extraction units. a fight in the wormhole escalates out of control and you start seeing t3 cruisers entering the brawl. player is told to escape through the wormhole marked on the hud. unfortunately, the wh exit leads to the fight in player 1's route.3 - your exploration is well attempted as you learn some ins and outs of probes. a tutorial of using and setting up probes (not launched by you) is used to show how to probe out things. player n is able to play around with the probing until they have found: a relic site, a sanctum/haven, and an asteroid field. local spikes and the player is told to use the probes to scan out the ships. a tooltip can be used to show the difference between probe types. upon scanning down these new ships, player is asked to warp.1 - war is hell. the fight is escalating quickly but the player is shown tooltips on shooting the primarys called by others. ships are cynoing in slowly, from frigates to cruisers and up (base hulls only, don't want veterans getting any ideas) player is told to help take down the cynoing ship. taking it down is fun, but another cyno starts bringing in capital ships. player can either join in or fly around these giant monsters until something (laser, gun missle, smartbomb) takes them down.2 - same as above, only as a pirate gang, the player is told to stay calm and shoot everyone.3- same as player 1, only as a noncombattant player can fly around the battle but a random ship targets and blows them away.wake up with a (fake) killmail telling the player what happened and explains the outcome of the fight. tutorial about difference between caps and subcaps can be used but tooltips can suffice. congrats! you can now eve.oderint, dum metuant. let them hate, so long as they fear. -accius"
1/15/2014,"when i started my first character in eve (i think was 2006) the tutorial was something like: ""hello capsuleer, this is a rookie ship, this is a mining laser. undock and gtfo"". end of tutorial. the gui was terrible and everything was not intuintive, the game was harder and less forgiving.even so, with such a bad new player experience the game was steady growing, attracting new players and retaining them. growing game -> growing playerbase.improved tutorials, more scripted events aimed to new players, are all good things and always welcome.but thinking that current demographic stagnation is a mere matter of improving tutorials is naive.people approaching mmorpg search for the feeling to be part of a breathing, alive, universe (a sci-fi simulator in our case), now (since several years) probably ccp is unable to transmit this feeling or to translate it in a proper game framework. if we want a growing playerbase then the game itself have to grow, fix strategic areas left unattended and extend his borders. limiting the work on eve to weaking and recycllyng lead to stagnation and to recycle always the same pool of players. until it lasts.it's an option too."
1/15/2014,"i like this idea alot and i agree with those that said to let the person try different thingsmaybe start out in a frig and kill some small rats, get picked up by a gang and go roaming, then someone batphones your group so you reship to a bs/bc and are jumped into a huge fight!"
1/15/2014,"ok, to clear things up i might have to post this idea:the title makes eve a verb.why would a new player eve?it's an open ended question/statement. i'm letting new players fill that in.oderint, dum metuant. let them hate, so long as they fear. -accius"

1/15/2014,"i do like this.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
1/15/2014,i still think that after a few months toons should be auto kicked from normal npc corps.there are 2 ways i think it could work well.1. you are automatically given a corp name and dropped in a one man corp (that can be changed once from default).so one day you wake up and find yourself in evecorp454237289. you may leave it for another player corp or name it and build it or just sit in it all by yourself forever (leaving you very vunerable to war decs.) this would require a change in how the corporate skill works as they would need to allow a one man corp while unskilled. training the corp skills would be required to build it past that.2. 4 new high sec factions are added and you are dropped into them depending on toons race after a few months.these corps would be a stripped down/basic version of fw. so maybe not open war but navy npc's etc etc hassle you in the opposite factions space.so you can then either join a proper player corp or lose easy access to 1/2 of high sec.admittedly i am someone who thinks navy npc's have no place in eve. (no one deserves npc protection while at war) but while ever ccp have such a stupid mechanic in place - why not use it for some good?i also admit - any move to force people into player corps would break the sandbox a bit as once people are forced into joining player corps - recruitment scamming would have to be a ban offense or result in a negative wallet for the scammer.it is not a big loss if recruitment scams ended as they are only done against new players by weak people who can not gain advantage over older players.
1/15/2014,why?
1/15/2014,the problem with that is - the people most likely to participate in a live event do not know the game mechanics and tactics needed to do this yet.when you look at the player base ccp is trying to engage with the events it would be better to provide them with more help and guidance rather then less.how would 100 x lev 4 mission runners go about organizing a low or null sec roam if none of them have ever had the experience themselves before?it better for everyone in eve overall if ccp babysit them all the way and provide a solid adventure for the participants. if they have some good times in low sec or null sec during one of these events - there is more chance those player may take the next step all by themselves.i read about how the last event was ruined by gate campers (leet pvp? lol). i was not there and do not take part in the events but anyone who goes to that kind of effort to destroy an event for others instead of encouraging them to permanently leave the safety of high sec is short sighted and likely very ********. anyone with over 1/2 brain would have helped them and used it as a powerful way to recruit. but it is null bears we are talking about here so 1/2 a brain is a big ask. does it really hurt the sandbox if it is broken to engage a few players in new game play styles/areas for an hour every 6 months??? i think not.

1/16/2014,"yes, more good ideas from other games plz. eve shouldn't exist in a bubble."
1/16/2014,"that sounds great, +1 from mewhat i would probably like to see when going through this:-start undocking a battleship and heading to battle-short battle start, get players through logi shield repping, local armor repping and structural damage. that way people get clear views on the different types of ""life bars"", tanks, and how only shield regenerates by itself slowly -have the player escape the battlefield-boom: player is trapped in a bubble or tackled. followed by a small gang of frigates and subjected to different types of ew.-fight goes on for a little bit more, introducing drones, tracking and so on-drones get killed, player is defeated and podded by frigates. suddenly realizes ""bigger is not better"" concept-sp loss, clones and so oni also think that a battleship may be too much of a long term goal and get players frustrated and biased towards that size of ship, but mayber getting them killed by the smaller ships in the game may have the opposite effect and make them realize what they can achieve with cooperation and more accessible equipment"
1/16/2014,"we want to start off big because you get to showcase big ship combat, and when it does (as it should) you can showcase smaller ship combat.will it give people an expectation that battleships are what you should do? probably, but most people have that expectation that bigger is better. this introduction does not have to teach a person about economics in eve, just what a battle could look like.so start them in a battleship, then tweak it down as the fight goes on.as this is mostly a simulation, there is no real need to say ""yes these are good but you should not touch them for a year, so were going to give you this ship and this is what you do"", and have to ram it down their throat. as this suggestion is a method to hook players... lets hook the player."

1/18/2014,"today's events in hed gp are just another example in a long line of fights where the outcome is determined by lag and by ccp's continuing refusal to supply proper hardware on which to run these nodes. when will this stop? when is enough enough? when will ccp finally bring some new hardware to the table that will allow fleet battles to occur without one side or another having to deal with infinite warp tunnels preventing hardeners from being activated, lag causing dreads to cycle but not actually do anything, and these fleet fights getting determined by who got their first rather than which side shows up in force with the right ships?i'm not one saying i have the answer. like just about everyone here in this community i don't have behind the scenes access to see what pieces of hardware are being used to run these ""reinforced nodes"" but the fact that 100% server load and 10% tidi are becoming the norm for fleet battles shows that whatever ccp is doing about this is too little, too late. this battle didn't pop up in some unknown place, this wasn't some stealth attack out of nowhere, this battle was telegraphed in advance so ccp should have been able to handle it. so ccp, what is the problem? what is the bottleneck? you are in a unique position to have many thousands of vested individuals in the eve online community who do this stuff for a living. if amazon can keep it's servers up and responsive during black friday and cyber monday, and laugh off hackers' attempts to ddos them with the low orbit ion cannon, why can't ccp build a meganode (i'm guessing that the jita supernode is still inadequate for this task) that will actually be able to hang with this level of traffic or use? if there is a technical problem, then reach out to the community, talk to people who work for groups used to crunching endless amounts of data. i'd be willing to bet there is at least one person very familiar with the inner-workings of supercomputers who could provide some very positive insight right here in this community. so ccp, instead of giving us vague replies when we complain like ""we're working on it,"" please trust in the community that supports you and reach out to us, or at least give us some idea of what you're actually doing to solve a game breaking problem that we are facing on a regular basis."

1/19/2014,"i am pretty sure there is no such thing as hardware capable of handling that kind of fight. you can beg and scream and whine about servers as much as you want, but the hardware is simply not the issue here."
1/19/2014,"there is no better hardware.the problem with eve isn't its hardware, it's the 2004 software that doesn't properly scale to 2014 hardware.source"
1/19/2014,"that reply contains nice buzzwords and all, but wtf does that even mean? it's like a us politician promising change...and at this moment ccp has about as much credibility."
1/19/2014,"it means that ""they are working on it"" and ""you need to be patient."" changing the way an existing system operates (especially one as large and complex as eve) without completely scrapping and starting from square one (which takes almost as much time and results in any further improvements on the old system being ""wasted"") is a pain in the ass. fix one thing and another thing (which may not be related to the change in any way) will break.tldr: anyone who tells you ""that will be easy to code and implement"" is lying through their teeth.edit:eve code is ""single threaded"" which means that it can't really take advantage of multi-core systems. part of the reason it is this way is because...- multi-core cpus did not really exist at the time the base architecture for eve was created (circa 1998 - 2003).- actions that players take cannot be randomly processed and spat out. they have to follow a clear line of progression based on who started what first. that means that even with multi-threading you cannot process and execute an action further down the que until the ones before have been executed. so if one action is taking longer than the others to process and execute, the rest of the actions behind it have to wait. that is where the ""bottleneck"" is.one of their solutions (that they are working on) is to separate parts of the system (like the database) from the main server so there will less to process. they call it ""brain in a box"".however this is no ""silver bullet."" realistically it will just raise the threshold for when things get fubar."
1/19/2014,"all the easy changes were made years ago, before tidi.the only obvious improvements i can see are: - making the server code multithreaded. then they can take advantage of the current direction server hardware is improving in: sticking more cores into the server. - change sov mechanics to entourage fleets to split up across multiple systems instead of piling people into a single system. then the fight can be spread across multiple nodes.note that i said obvious, not easy. multithreading is going to be a lot of work, if it's even possible. i've got no idea where to start with changing sov mechanics."
1/19/2014,"if i were to mine in real life, i would do it somewhere that laws of personal property and police enforcement exist (ie, empire space). if i wanted to kill miners and make a buck off it, i would go to empire space and shoot and ransom miners."
1/19/2014,i was an industrialist in null running markets out there which is quite hard to do in the multiple null alliance ive been in either requiring cta mandatory every day where i've offer spent 15 hrs just sitting in a system guarding goonswarm space at things that never came while home space was failing due to the no one stays behind or you get kicked methods (including miners) to being over in yulia federation of being camped by blues i see no reason i should side with either side. there is also alliances that run mining in high sec and than ship to their null. since code has come out i've stopped mining and now i stopped missions in anything relatively expensive due to new groups targeting missions. now i use 142m to rely on market trades in station as i have no luck in pvp and don't see a point in skill less ganking. although i would like to see the market wiped with a set amount and all of eve have a tempory ban so to speak of all industry and let's see how far people get with out the resourceful people that are often frowned down upon
1/19/2014,"the battle in hed-gp proved one simple, undeniable fact.ccp is unable to provide a credible solution to the problems created by drone fleets in nullsec warfare.ccp's advertising includes ""choose your ship : pick the ships you want to fly from hundreds of widely varying models.customize and tune : each ship is highly customizable using modular equipment, rigs and subsystems.""what they should say is only archons, nyx and interceptors are worth having in nullsec now days. everything else, forget it. and forget nullsec industry too, it's gone thanks to odyessey making grav sites instantly pop up without scanning, and rubicon making interceptors warping to a grav site faster than a barge can get to warp. 700 dreads killed 7 archons. that says it all. rediculously unbalanced, defeated by tidi and server instability. so no-one should bother with dreads any more, as a class they are invalid (being the conceptual counter to carriers - but they can't do that). and nyx are better for sov grinding because you don't have siege cycles to get caught in by interceptors.and speaking of ship rebalancing and ccp's current love of drone ships - given the utter inability of ccp to have stable subservers, even on a reinforced node, unless you have drones that fight at server speed or are allocated to someone who actually does have the ability to play, forget it. yes, the pinnacle of nullsec pvp is currently assign drones, go have a coffee. done. it is skillless, mindless, and boring for everyone concerned. and there is zero place for new players in it - if you can't fly a slowcat archon, go back to highsec. where 99% of the game is, and apparently where 100% of the design effort is. that is simply not acceptable if this game is to survive as anything more than a wow in space.ccp needs to stop pretending that nullsec systems do not have a hard cap for players, and write a better protocol for how admission to the battle is handled. hed-gp proved it does, where the server loaded in 700 dreadnaughts one after the other - without their pilots having a chance to do anything - because it would not load a new one until the previous pilot was dead. they couldn't put their hardners on, couldn't target, and couldn't well .. anything. other than die. 50 minutes in a jump tunnel to load in dead is an insult to players and a gift to the 10 mmos out there under development who are looking to take customers off eve.so yes, hat should have been an epic battle has become a litmus test of eve online. people have been complaining that star citizen's design is bad because it has capped rooms for pvp to ensure quality of game play. but that is now beginning to look like a much better option than what eve offers, where 'unlimited' also means 'unplayable' past 600 players. they are being honest, and ccp is not.there has been a lot of rubbish added in recent expansions that does nothing but make nullsec less stable than it was. instant action interceptors do not help when the server can't even handle working out how to not crash. so yay the server did not crash - but the 'fix' of leaving pilots stuck in warp until they were dead is no fix at all. it is simply a bad joke on the community who actually play what passes for pvp these days. for real, make dreads do double damage against archons, and make drone assist limited by double the bandwidth of the ship assigned to. not to mention stop lying about epic warfare, hundreds of ships to choose from, and new players being able to participate. if you don't buy a character who can fly an archon, you can't. simple as that. and yes, i can't wait for star citizen. i love eve online, and have played since 2005. but guess what, ccp is spending all the developer time making fluffy junk for highsec carebears, and has ground nullsec industry into the mud with cloaky campers (because gee we needed more covert ships for campers to use to stop all play in null!) and left archon blob fleets win by crashing servers and attacking fleets. not good enough, not nearly good enough. so yes, i'd rather spend my money on something new."
1/19/2014,"according to whiner logic, not introducing content lets ui designers, graphics/sound artists and balance devs become programming gurus who can work on node stability.i read it on the internet, so it must be true.oh, if you're too angry to wait for brain in a box, can i have your stuff?"
1/19/2014,"i think the problem new players have is having too many options thrown at them. the phenomenon is called analysis paralysis. which is in fact my favorite term in the universe. see wikipedia about it. having a way to make the billion choices new players have now to fewer more obvious choices is the key. so they have lets say 3-4 choices at first, then each choice leads to 3-4 choices, which each leads to 3-4 choices etc. so that they do not react to it all with realizing the problem is so complex because the choices are so many, that they choose none of the options presented (they opt out, if you will). the phenomenon shows itself in all walks of life, for example when you as a business offer your employees pension plans. the more options you offer them, the lower the participation rate is. new players are offered the choice of a smattering of skills, and are not told which skills they require for a research career or what skills they require for a shooting career, etc. then they are pushed into a world with hundreds of corps and alliances, and hundreds of solar systems, and lots of ships (the new isis system makes the ship stuff less paralyzing). and a huge number of them, choose to opt out and not choose any player corporations at all. i think walking in station would have some room for making choices less paralyzing. you could have rooms with lots of things in them that allow players to see what is ahead of them, and each thing could have a simple visual interface that guides them through each process by only giving them 2-3 options at a time."

1/20/2014,"i'm sure many people agree that something is not right about drones in their current form and this was still the case before all the wonderful drone mods ccp has added in the more recent patches.i will clarify i am an avid lover of drones, so i don't want them to be hit with the nerf bat just because they aren't working and if i seem a bit biased i am.so lets startdrone limits.the current drone limits are slightly problematic as they cause a higher server load as they change 1 ship into 6 (or so i'd guess).ccp added weapon grouping to reduce load this but since drones still randomly split fire i'd assume this isn't applied to them.so the next step would be to force drones to group and act as a single unit or alternatively reduce them to 2 actual units and spread their stats from 5 units within those units.these would hopefully reduce any server load issue.drone and ships.it has always been a problem in my view that nearly every ship in eve can use drones and this shouldn't be the case.so setting aside drone boats or drone based ships, as they should be able to use the maximum amount of drones, all other ships should be heavily limited in the amount of drones they can use from 0-2.now while this would be annoying to start with it would define drone ships more proudly and at the same time they should be also limited in the high slot weapons they can use.carriers and supercarriersremove the ability for them to use drones and replace them with 4 fighter classes.light fighters - 1/4 the damage, hp, size of normal fighters keeps the bandwidthmedium fighters - 1/2 he damage, hp, size of normal fighters keeps the bandwidthheavy fighters - what normal fighters are nowfighter bombers - what they are now.the reason for the above is that carriers should be limited in how many drones they can carry, this also cuts into the ratting elements of carriers but doesn't leave them vulnerable missing lighter drones.a secondary change i'd like to see is a reduction of the actual units with grouping or with merging and spreading of stats, carrier and supercarriers should still be scary with their extreme numbers but not so much that they can fll up your overview completely with several of them.drone groupingi mentioned drone grouping and i now want to go into more detail about how it could work, firstly it should probably be called squads or something but it doesn't matter too much.so the idea behind this is the same as how the group windows currently work with drones but instead of them being a way to just organise your drones they are become a linked unit as it were, meaning they all suffer from ewar affects and damage equally but they also act as a single ""bigger"" drone.they would be locked to 5 per group and would have to be the same unit.aoe affects such as smartbombs and bombs would have a multiplier of 5 against them.while this has many downsides in terms of solo players i believe that in huge fleet fights this would be very useful in reducing the drone lag that is related to it.tl:dr reduce drone number or their affect on the server.reduce the amount of ships that can use drones, while in term making drone ships less able to use other weapons.remove normal drones from carriers, replace them with fighter based counterparts.implement a way to group drones."
1/20/2014,"was that drones, or was that jamming four thousand or so people into one system, and jumping in hundreds of dread on grid with everything else?speaking as someone who was actually in the dread fleet, as opposed to some random forum alt, that's not how it happened. while i didn't jump in myself, i was in comms with people who did, and it wasn't one dread at a time. the server was struggling, and dropping in batches all at once. weird bullshit happened with them, there were blackscreens, module lag was horrendous and doomsdays were (again) the only thing that worked.drones were never even mentioned. trying to cyno several hundred of anything in all at once all on grid will generally end up like this.if it had been the other way around, with the cfc/russian dreads getting in well before the n3/pl carriers, the exact same problems would have happened."
1/20/2014,"hello everyone,i would like to make a request in light of the huge success of the ""little things"" crowd sourcing event.dear ccp,i know you guys have lots of great developers and engineers but you have also been blessed with one of (if not the most) intelligent and skilled community in the it department. thousands of developers, system administrators, security specialists, it architects and infrastructure designers.i personally am an it infrastructure and service design architect.we would really love if you would use us to crowd source new ideas of engine design to combat the one and true enemy ""soul crushing-lag""publish anonymized schematics and information about your clustering/infrastructure (hardware), database backbone (and internal design), game engine (query processing/information flow), session handling (client-server ).do a dev blog set up some quality metrics and lets us give you our ideas and designs, and you get to review them and who knows maybe prototype some of them.use us, it doesn't cost you anything and we can feel that we contributed something even if we don't manage to help you, but at least we tried. so why not tap into this huge free work force? it free!!"

1/21/2014,we can has?i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
1/21/2014,"actually you have an excellent method to introduce lore into the game.start off the capsuleer as a real person, full skills in their races ships and weapons (essentially make the person ""uber"" and capable of fielding excellent ships, weapons, etc). so skillwise, they would be an excellent battleship pilot, battlecruiser pilot, etc.at the end of this tutorial, once they are podded or ""killed"" in real life, the person becomes reanimated as a capsuleer, but due to the transition, they lost all their skill, so now they must begin to train up. this also bridges the whole concept of their damn immortality, how capsuleer's never die, how skillpoints can be lost, how pods work, etc.there have been a few games that start off with the player being literally some supreme god (or in this case, an excellent pilot), who gets reduced to a scrub and must climb their way back up to being amazing.oddly enough this can be done... easily in eve.i like the concept, as it gives you a birthright, a beginning, a reason for being a capsuleer. same thing just giving a purpose to the player."

1/21/2014,dunno been nice to have in 1.1
1/21/2014,"while most see the stealth bomber as an exceptionally versatile, multirole ship, there is the major drawback that it does have that completely invalidates this entire thread. that is the simple fact that they are paper thin at best, even when they are fit correctly.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
1/21/2014,"lol op whut ? are one of the most successful and balanced ships in eve, plus they are one of the rare ships that require actual piloting skills, excellent squad coordination, reactivity and good 3d awareness."
1/21/2014,"wrong. there is such a thing like dynamically synced threads, whereby you create one thread per player, that can be processed in parallel and if players interact it's only then that they start waiting for each other as the threads inter-twine. even then each thread is capable of consuming one core that means that 100 players can consume 100 cores thus paralleling the workload. unlike now where all 100 players are stuck on 1 single core while the rest of the cores sit idle, mostly disabled to allow for that 1 single core to be overclocked to hell and back."
1/21/2014,"there is no possible way ccp could afford a 1 core per player approach. think about it for a minute - i don't even think they could afford a 1 thread per player approach. you log on and see 40,000 players. an ibm watson is a cluster of 90 servers, each running 4 x 8-core 3.5ghz cpus with 4 threads per core - total is 2,880 cores and 11,520 threads which costs about $3 million. ccp would need 4 of these ($12 million + support) to support 40k players @ 1 dedicated thread each. that said, it is not unreasonable to expect a company with $66m in annual revenue to spit out $3m for one of these, and move the core database processing into the 16 tb of ram that this monster has. you are correct though that none of this helps if their base code is not set up for parallel processing."
1/21/2014,"if anything, a means of color coding the orders between pilot and corporation should be made available.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
1/21/2014,"brain in box is a chimera, like many other things ccp's promised and never delivered, like pos rework, sov fixing etc....it's marketing at his best, don't be a fool"
1/21/2014,"brain in a box will not solve their main problem of the core engine not being multi-threaded. it will remove some strain from the existing infrastructure making it perform better, it will work exactly like tidi. it delays the inevitable."
1/21/2014,"it is very, very simple. like hundreds of my fellow coalition, i have today cancelled all of my eve online subscriptions.enough ccp. the state of nullsec is not worthy of paying real money for. jump, luanch drones, assign drones, call it pvp? i think not. world of warcraft currently has more depth in pvp. that is a horrible admission for a player who loves eve online to make, but it is true. so either nerf archons, buff dreads, and make null servers actually stable (inclduing the ones around the battlefield system, come on you don't have to be a genius to work out that you need to reinforce more than 1 system when a 4 to 5,000 player battle is expected), or watch all the players and thier credit cards walk out the door.and let's be very clear here. plex does not pay the rent. us$ subscriptions pay the rent.you will get no more real money from any of us until this debacle is fixed. why? because we are going to spend it all on star citizen - if we are going to be lied to by developers, at least we can have new prettier lies to enjoy before the big let down.ps no you can't have my stuff. when eve goes free to play (as it must, when star citizen steals 50% or more of its players), i might want my stuff. or not. but hey, i am keeping the option."
1/21/2014,"if you have played eve long enough, you realize that the original base for it was not much more than the old mud code from the 1990's, with a graphic overlay. characters, ships, systems - they are nothing more than database records with a bunch of flags and timers attached, along with some pointers to other databases. as such it has an upper limit on how much data they can process and update in real time. i know tidi was supposed to address this issue - by giving the servers more time for back-end processing and lessening the amount of data they had to transmit to you per second. obviously they have some other issues as well. i'd be amazed if the back-end database engines are not multi-threaded and working as fast as they can to try to keep up with all the updates to the tables, but i think the sheer amount of data in the system is the real problem. it is a problem of game design, but the problem is that they are not limiting the game design to the amount of data it can reasonably handle in real time. this is why you see other mmorpgs limit the number of players in a pvp situation in the same place at the same time. i really think the only way they solve this is to limit the number of ships in a system at the same time ."

1/22/2014,"was thinking about this recently and thought maybe we could even do up versions of them like the current industrials.a t1 hauler version that can barely haul the largest bc size (270,000m3 or 400,000m3 if you include the industrials). since the orca can currently haul 400,000m3 in it's ship maintenance bay and having a t1 hauler that could compete on that level may be a bit imbalanced you could drop it down to barely haul the largest cruiser size (120,000m3 or 200,000m3 if you include mining barges) or maybe barely haul 2 of the largest cruiser size (240,000m3).a freighter size that can barely haul 8 of the largest bs size (4,760,000m3). (this makes it 2x as good as the jump freighter version)a jump freighter size that can barely haul 4 of the largest bs size (2,380,000m3). (this makes it 2x as good as carriers are currently)"

1/22/2014,"during reinforce timers ihub , station will be protected by damping field - that will prevent those structures from being attacked. 10 minutes before reinforce timer , attacker and defender can assemble up to 50? people subcapital fleet that must be taken into the subspace pocked where installation controlling this dampening field is located. depending on the system security status - allowed ships and number ships per group can varry.installation is only accessible when other group of players have been eliminated. winning side can decide if they want to put structure in the next timer or use sbu scrambler to cycle all sbu in the contested system. - most of lagfests are gone- bloob battles and bloob importance is gone- mini tournaments on each timer- movies from those skirmishes grate for eve adversing. - subspace pocket can be hosted on separate node. during the tcu defense/attack normal lagfest."
1/22/2014,tournaments in their current format are both exhausting to participate in and exhausting to watch. it would be much better if they were played in the manner of footbal leagues through entire year: like every saturday and sunday two or four matches are played. it's also better for people in other timezones as it's much easier to not spoil yourself the results and watch 1-2 hours of recorded stream instead of watching entire day.also disconnect = death is too harsh penalty. ship should stay in place and allow player to reconnnect. quite a few matches were stupidly lost because of that.
1/22/2014,"consider tournaments where there is some goal other than exploding the other side. for example:ew football. was popular for a bit. the goal was to tractor a can to your goal. any non-damaging mod could be used: webs, ecm, neuts, ect.races. these do get run. there can be all sorts of variations. like just pure speed, allowing non-damaging weapons, or go back to allowing explosions.player tools: a way to have near perfect security. this is eve and someone will try and spoil the party if it is in any way possible for them to do it. guarding against such people is so difficult that most players just give up on the idea of running their own tournament. right now ""do it on sisi"" works almost perfectly as interfering is a bannable action.a way to know distances. ship distance from a beacon, or a race turn point, or the distance of a can from a goal.a way to know times. like the time a ship is within a set distance of a beacon.a way to set beacons.a way to disqualify participants who violate a rule. (your ship is out of bounds.. boom!!!""for cost control: a way to know the cost and meta of everything on someone's ship, quickly and easily."
1/22/2014,"i'll write up a longer response to the op later, but this has existed since neo 1 or atx i believe. there's an invisible bubble so when you disconnect your ship just sits there. the only exception to this is in the first few seconds when everyone is warping in, since the bubble is not up at that point."
1/22/2014,"ways to reduce the player/money gap --- bans generally force pilots to have multiple fleet concepts setup ahead of time, so they can reship appropriately. this is a source of moderate expense (although i prefer having bans, as it makes the tourney more interesting). --- ships themselves can vary wildly in pricing. faction & t2 battleships go for 500-1b+ each, which becomes very expensive very fast. --- skill gap: some ships are really good, but extremely skill intensive to fly (like command ships with warfare links). with all these in mind, you could run tournaments that remove the pricey elements. for example, a tournament consisting only of t2 cruisers and below. these are easier to afford, have a lower sp wall, and could still be very interesting & fun to watch as more & more explosions happen. alternatively, you can artificially create this through a more steeply structured point system. ways to increase interest in tournaments, both for participants and viewers interact with the fans: surveys for mvp and/or best matches. you could make bans come from the players rather than team captains (ok, this would be gamed). you could add in obstacles. ways to encourage new teams to participate in tournaments have more tourney slots and lower the barrier to be competitive. lower the cost of entry, and lower the time window requirement of the tourney. a 10 vs 10 frigate match doesn't need 15 minutes a match, and can be very entertaining. ways to tier tournaments so everyone can find a tournament to be competitive in t1 frigate tourneydessie & t2/pirate frig tourneycruiser tourney, etc... ways to provide the community with the proper tools to host their own tournaments, be it on a separate server or on tq environmental control: password protected systems like last years duality was nice. deployable beacons, etc. observation ship: create a ship with a 250km lock range, 12 max targets, passive targeting as a special ability, a unique ship class (so it can be easily filtered off the overview), but lacks the ability to fit any remote assistance and/or offensive modules (could simply be no mids, no highs). i'd also like to hear your ideas on new prizes aimed specifically at newer teams, for instance a good prize for ""best new team"" for the new eden open. if we get good ideas i really want to add something like that to the neoii-- eve collectors edition. -- smaller prizes: pirate frig / cruiser / bs pack. implant set. -- gag gifts: if someone distinguishes themselves for flying a hero damp ship, give them 100 damps or damp ships."
1/22/2014,"> ways to reduce the player/money gapyou mean how the richest alliances always get spots in tournaments? if so here are some possibilities:-little guy format: all players are not eligible for the tourney, who are a member of an alliance or corporation, which contains more than 1000 members as of the announce date of the tourney-have tournaments much more frequently, that do not have an option to buy-in for your team's slot. instead randomly choose all teams. you could help deal with crappy teams by blacklisting, or at least give lower weighting chances, to players who repeatedly fail to show or are unsporting. -if combined with a tier system this would have the best of both worlds - frequent battles between similarly classed teams without letting any team's money come into play.if your concern is instead the richest alliances have enough money to buy etanas and bhaalgorns... i would do a flat rate tournament entry fee from tq wallets. (i would try ~500m per team for a low-tier, just-for-fun tournament and scale up for higher tier events). run it on sisi so players can use any gear they want. put any restrictions you want for the format ('no special edition ships,' 'frigates only,' etc).>ways to increase interest in tournaments, both for participants and viewers-run more tournaments. way more. one per week in each of several tiers. -find really entertaining announcers. i was quite happy with the atxi announcers but you will need more to prevent burnout with frequent tournaments. make sure the announcers are trying to engage non-eve players who found the stream e.g. explaining the basics every now and then. you don't need the announcers physically present, give them access to a mumble server whose audio is mixed into the stream audio.-see if you can get twitch to display ads to ppl watching other streams: ""team deathmatch... in space! now live: eve online rookie tournament - week 13"">ways to encourage new teams to participate in tournaments-ingame decorations to 1st and 2nd place winners-play on sisi with an entry fee that even a handful of brave newbies can afford-pickup matches that follow tournament rules, but are just for fun, so prospective teams can see what it's all about. >ways to tier tournaments so everyone can find a tournament to be competitive inthe first thing that comes to mind is to start off with a basic metric of pvp activity, kill count-announce open entry for all teams, no limit to how many.-get each team member's total kill count over the past year (not isk destroyed) -calculate the sum to get the team's total kill count-sort the teams by kill count and bin them into however many tiers you wantso that's what i would use as a starting point to kinda bootstrap the tier system. you would of course want to explore more relevant ways for teams to affect their tier status e.g. tourney kills, tourney wins, no-shows etc.>ways to provide the community with the proper tools to host their own tournaments, be it on a separate server or on tq-make a bot that blows up ships crossing the edge of glory so you don't need a dev to do it-make a bot similar to 'moveme' that is used to move team members who are staging, into a station in the tourney system. have it put red team in red station and blue team in blue station. align the undocks of both stations towards the arena. destroy any ships that warp anywhere from their station before the match begins.-have a bot announce in local 'fight!' and turn off the destroy-ships-that-warp mechanic-have a 'rules' bot who i can link my fit to, and it tells me if it is a legal fit for this format-one way to detect people using illegal fits would be to destroy all ships after a winner is found, then have a script look at all killmails generated to detect problems (not sure how you could control implant use unless you podded everyone too)-you might also be able to parse killmails to automatically identify the winner of each match>i'd also like to hear your ideas on new prizes aimed specifically at newer teams, for instance a good prize for ""best new team"" for the new eden open. if we get good ideas i really want to add something like that to the neoii-again, ingame decorations would be nice-flavor items are always nice-maybe make a rendering of their characters standing in front of a big neo ii backdrop and put it on the launcher and community page-maybe a devblog/community spotlight talking with the 'best new team'-remember that 'ten year veteran' station? how about a station for tournament winners and/or teams that didn't win but are granted honors like ""best new team""little things to improve =<U+22C1>= | my little things posts"

1/22/2014,"i really like what i am reading here so far. i'd also want to open the floor for some alternative competitive event ideas. much like earlier in this thread. we worked on a ""hunger games"" concept a bit back but that got scrapped. so if you can think of something cool i'd definitely like to do something different."
1/22/2014,"ccp bro wrote: ways to increase interest in tournaments, both for participants and viewers during breaks there could be in game events with prizes, similar to what somer blink has done or even more ccp roaming fleets. also more promotional videos, there's a lot of really talented video editors that play eve, so perhaps even get the eve community involved with prizes for best alliance tournament promo videos. releasing compilations of the alliance tournaments best and most exciting contests in the lead up would also generate more hype.ccp bro wrote: ways to encourage new teams to participate in tournaments perhaps tutorial videos would inspire new teams to participate, making sure everyone's aware of how to use sisi for practice and give examples of popular tournament fleet compositions. i think also getting some of the tournament veterans to talk about their preparation for past tournaments and their experiences in the later rounds (perhaps this could be done at fanfest?).ccp bro wrote: ways to tier tournaments so everyone can find a tournament to be competitive in i like the idea of a several smaller tournaments for those alliances that don't have the funds that certain alliances do. these tournaments wouldn't have a large buy in price and would be shown in the weeks running up to the alliance tournament/new eden open. perhaps the victor gets a place in the new eden open/alliance tournament as it's reward.ccp bro wrote:i'd also like to hear your ideas on new prizes aimed specifically at newer teams, for instance a good prize for ""best new team"" for the new eden open. if we get good ideas i really want to add something like that to the neoiibest newcomerbiggest overachieversbiggest upsetmost creative fleet compfastest wincheapest successful fleet compwinners to be for voted by the broadcast team as to stay somewhat impartial."
1/22/2014,if you wanted to do a hunger games thing you could just have like 12-24 teams of 5-10 all random in one system. have the gates turned off and have them hunt each other. gms could spawn certain items for the teams based on crowd response and their specific needs(i.e. probe launcher and a depot if their scout dies). last team standing wins.
1/22/2014,"oh wow lets see, others have had some good ideas already...ctf with tractor beams, no damaging modules allowed obstacle course with beacon checkpoints - interceptor pilots for speed runs, or covert ops (maybe with >1x tidi) for precision flying (don't decloak!) dogpile - one team gets a single badass ship (anything subcap maybe?) and all other teammates fly noobships; the other team gets to fly a more normal comp, maybe t1 cruiser down or dessy down. 1v1 ladders, if you develop all these automation tools for team fights they would probably work just as well for 1v1s i do like the hunger games idea and suggest that you periodically activate different wormhole effects. maybe everyone starts in frigates spawned randomly in the system and you put a 'supplies' beacon where bigger ships are floating in space, pre-fit, plus some mobile jump units and mobile warp disruptors to take. i think lucine's idea for many teams that are all locked in a system is great. you could hide further supply caches in cosmic signatures and spawn them as desired. minmatar militia format: give every pilot a random fitted ship (with some specifications of what skills will be required to fly everything) brutor cheerleeding squad: upon starting the competition each team is given a particular formation to form - all in a line, smiley face, cube, sphere, 7o... any team may claim 'done' at which point 0.01x tidi is activated while the judges decide whether the team has successfully completed their formation. if the judges rule against the team, tidi goes back to normal 1x and that team must wait n seconds before another 'done' claim. ender's game format: red team's goal is to get from their start point to a beacon on the surface of a planet, light a cyno, and jump a capital ship to it. blue team's goal is to prevent the capital from jumping in. warping in the arena is allowed, mobile cyno disruptors and mobile warp disruptors are allowed drebuchet bowling :)little things to improve =<U+22C1>= | my little things posts"
1/22/2014,"idea 1: solo or team deathrace: after the countdown, everyone must fly 600 km's to an acceleration gate and activate it. live weapons fire, score people based on finish time. add in obstacles like mines, proximity activated stasis web towers, and the like for extra fun. bonus prizes for ship kills. this is very scaleable... and could have a 1000 pilots participating at once (although i'd recommend rfing the node). idea 2: hunger games: everyone starts on the edge of a sphere 20 km's apart from one another... at countdown, may the odds be ever in your favor! idea 3: team starship troopers: teams must defeat wave after wave after ever increasingly brutal wave of npc's.... whoever can survive the longest wins. (sleeper ai, jams, neuts, and webs a must). use sleeper rats so salvage and bounties aren't an issue. idea 4: team capture the flag. to be done in highsec. whoever picks up the flag goes suspect so everyone can shoot them. flag must be moved to your base (a can you drop it in). shooting someone not a suspect gets you concorded. suspect can return fire if aggressed thanks to limited engagements. coding should ensure the flag always drops as loot to be picked up by the next pilot. idea 5: bumper cars: put a large ship (titan) in the center of an arena... bump it around (this sounds kinda lame tbh). *edit* make this gladiator challenge style, and combine these for a multi-obstacle tournament series."
1/22/2014,"a few ideas:first on the isk gap. this is only an issue in the ats/neo where there are massive prizes at stake. have smaller prizes and noone will consider fielding etanas or chremorases or the like.of course smaller prizes will only be worth running if ccp can make tournaments automated, so that no ccp intervention is required in running the tournament.secondly on the sp gap. this can be addressed by disallowing warfare links. command ships are the only subcapital ship class that requires more than three months or so of dedicated training to work. what i'd like to see: a system where you run 8 team low stakes tournaments on demand via an automated system.on other formats: i really think the hunger games approach has merit. give every player a tech 1 fitted tech 1 frigate to start with, and litter the field with better ships you can eject from your frigate and jump into."
1/22/2014,"hello. reimbursement policy is missing some important information. hed fight was classified as large-scale player engagement and :""any losses of any kind resulting from a large-scale player engagement are not covered by this reimbursement policy.""1. can ccp be more precise and define what is ""large-scale player engagement"".is this means for example local bigger than 300 people or 300 people shooting. 2. how normal player can protect itself from being a part of something that is against ccp policy.we cannot know :- what is on the another side of the gate , cyno in case of capitals- if someone else will jump in into the system3. can we get some popup that will state before entering system :- ""you are about to enter large-scale player engagement that is against ccp reimbursement policy and not supported by eve. do you want to execute the jump. yes/no"" or when you are in the system:- ""current system escalated to large-scale player engagement that is against ccp reimbursement policy and not supported by eve.do you want to continue to be here or do you want your ship to be moved to the nearest safe system. yes/no""yes i know "" do not undock "".but i ask for clarification from ccp employee and answers how player can defend himself from being in some events that are not supported and against official ccp policy. thank you for your answer."
1/22/2014,"1) if you don't know what a ""large-scale player engagement"" is, you shouldn't be undocking.2) large-scale engagements aren't against ccp policy. reimbursing except for very obvious ccp screw-ups is usually denied by ccp. and, in the case of large pvp fights where reimbursement of potentially hundreds of ships is possible, is explicitly listed as being a no-reimbursement-zone. deal with it.2a) yes, you very well (or your fc) knows whats on the other side of a gate or whats potentially coming or you (or your fc) is bad.3) you shouldn't be undocking and heading into large fleet warfare if you don't understand what it is. deal with it."

1/23/2014,"obviously ccp can't say ""x players is a large fight, no less"", because at some point in some place there would be someone fighting with x-2 people and demand unfair reimbursement.this is not about ""bugs they can't manage"", this is about not giving any advantage to one side of a conflict.if you don't want to go in a fight without knowing your ship will be reimbursed, maybe you should join an alliance that offers a reimbursement program, an not rely on deus ex ccp to save you."

1/24/2014,please read my posts. i don't have any issues with no reimbursement. ccp should clarify just what is large - scale player engagement. because:- this will allow each player to be aware that they are in this position- cut all speculations why some items where and few days later in similar engagement where not reimbursed. my primary goal is to persuade ccp to add to policy clear statement. large - scale player engagement occurrences when:- local reaches (for example ) 800 people in the system. or - on kill mails you have more than 255 people. (or maybe both?)all looses caused during this time will be not reimbursed. we had situation where overloaded node crashed - and yet all items bugged during this accident where reimbursed (eg billions in fighter bombers)recent nyx with over 300 people on its kill mail - also reimbursed. at the same time all people in hed are denied reimbursement based on the same rules that others in the similar situations got it. those few lines in policy defining what is large player engagement will cut all speculations in future incidents.
1/24/2014,"do you lack an understanding of the concept of intentional vagueness? do you understand the need for intentional vagueness?let's see if this will suffice - all reimbursement requests will be evaluated on a case by case basis.""grr kimmi nerf chans!"" ~jenn aside www.eve-radio.com join eve radio channel in game!"
1/24/2014,i believe that tidi works on the node not individual systems. so you and your 40 man 'nogunfire' gang didn't cause the tidi.... something else going on in another system on the same node did.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.
1/24/2014,"i dunno why you folks keep spamming this. the policy is clear, one could be entiteled to a reinbursement only in case of some server bug (if you can prove it): basically very few scenarios are covered: node or server crashing du to some bug (not simple overload) and similar.the large-scale battle thing steps in only to enforce the concept that even if you can prove there was some bug will not be considerated if happened in some massive battle.so, in the first place, you have to run in a bug if you want to try to ask a reimboursement. the flow is:#1. were you victim of a bug or server error? 1a) yes -> goto #2 1b) no - > deal with it#2. where you in a large fleet engagment? 2a) yes -> deal with it 2b) no -> maybe you' are entiteled to a reimboursementhed is typical scenario where nobody is entiteled to any reimboursement. any half experienced eve player know how ccp handle this. if your blob leaders or fc are telling you something different (and pushing yout o spam eve forum) then they're either incompetents or liars; in both cases better to drop them."
1/24/2014,"i honestly think it's an ocd thing... that there needs to be quantifiable numbers for every action/scenario you take and lacking those numbers is a problem in of itself (worthy of simply deleting everything and starting from scratch until it can be quantified).i have a guy in my office like this. damn good number cruncher, but can't comprehend dynamic situations and that there may be mutiple answeres for a single question (because circumstances are not always the same)."
1/24/2014,"the root problem is that it isn't always numbers in system that cause the instability. a relatively small number of people can spike time dilation by all jumping a gate at once, or all undocking at once, etc., but that's not an issue because it's just a spike, and it's well within what the system can handle.let's say you get to hed-gp before rus/cfc do. you get your dialog box saying, hey, you can jump into system. we got this! so you jump, go wherever you're going, and suddenly 1700 more ships on grid. boom, you're in a large-scale fight, and one side just hit the system much harder than time dilation can handle, and you and lots of other people are under lag. ccp can no longer guarantee the performance of the system because of actions taken by the players that overloaded it, and you get no reimbursement.basically, the causes of large-scale fights are too dynamic to predict. by the time it's obvious that you're in one, you're in it. don't fly what you can't afford to lose."
1/24/2014,"but is not relevant. poor performances, overload of the systems, lag and so on do not make you elegible to a reimbursement. you can ask for it only in case of loss as direct consequence of a bug.the ""large fleet engagment"" reference is only to say that if you are in a large fight they don't even bother to check if was a loss caused by a bug or not.on the countrary this people keep talking as they should be informed before the undock if there will be a bug and if there will be in a large fleet engagment.again: everyone in eve know as the reimbursemnt policy work; they keep creating alts and spamming the forum with this **** is only cause their blob leaders ordered them to do so, to suggest the idea they lost a battle due to some bug/technical issue, and -oh, how unfair and cruel is the world! - it's the same old whine. they got the loss reimbursed from their alliance anyway."

1/25/2014,"if you really want to have new players involved, the best way is probably to set up leagues. you could have an entry league where ships and fits were announced and publicized well in advance, so that new players who wanted to participate would have training goals. (and, obviously, there would be no bans, because as tactically interesting as they are, they disproportionately hurt new players.) have them as seasons with schedules, like any sport would. then, have a championship round once a year. or, take a cue from american college football and have ""bowl"" (bubble?) games hosted by the various empires (npc or capsuleer?), vying with each other for prestige.i will second the request to have deployables available that facilitate the construction of games. not ""arena-in-a-box"" do-everything deployables, but special bubbles, anchors, timers--single-purpose ""raw material"" items that can be assembled into games by the players. that way, it may be possible for a player-created sport to become popular, even popular enough to eventually become something like the scl."

1/26/2014,"it is my understanding that the csm opposing an idea put forth by ccp is a thing that happens because ccp has a bad idea, and the csm is pointing out why. it's not like the csm has arbitrary power to change the game; when they support or oppose a position, then need reasons. in this case, the reason is that the fix proposed would've technically fixed the one specific issue at hand ( scams being possible in part due to the market interface 'lying') in exchange for a non-trivial nerf to market play in general. they opposed the nerf, which would've had a rather more significant negative impact on the playerbase than the scam. that's a good thing, imo."

1/30/2014,"or even a simple warning, that tells users that orders are not guaranteed and buyer beware.there is nothing wrong with or the skill used. the error comes from those who make bad investments, believing they are going to make some nice isk and blaming everything but themselves.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
1/30/2014,"with all the titans and blops bs's jumping to their target destination instead of bridge to, i propose a simple change to the ui for the right click menu when clicking on the ship or capacitor.currently, the bridge to and jump to selections are 3 or 4 slots apart, but both menu's expand to the right, creating a possible ( and well documented via killboards) result.the short term fix is very simple. have jump to remain cascading to the right, and bridge to cascading to the left.a very simple change that will distinguish which you have selected.other changes that would help the pilots in larger alliances is possibly the greying out of beacons that are not in range."
1/30/2014,no.
1/30/2014,+1 very useful.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.
1/30/2014,"the problem is, this has actual performance downsides, whereas the only real benefit is ""better server performance"", in which case no one would give a damn.as for your idea about the fighters changes, that would be better served in a separate thread idea, but you may as well just keep them how they are, instead of having ""this is totally not just a drone with a different name even though it is"".as for ships being heavily restricted in the drones they can field, thats infeasible for missions any kind of solo play with larger ships, as you would become completely unable to counter smaller ships with a alrger one, as you would no longer have a ""point-defense"" style weapon system of any strength."
1/30/2014,"same with grouped guns, you don't hear anyone complaining as it's purely optional.so having the ehp of a figher, the ability to chase in warp and be assigned is ""this is totally not just a drone with a different name even though it is"".however this is a drone revamp thread, fighters are a brand of drones and they also need to be altered due to the way carriers and supercarriers work.i don't even see how this is a valid point, people use drones because they are easy and with the new changes to npc ai they are no longer ""easy"" target painters and webs are the easy way to hit smaller ai ships and the only reason people stopped doing this is because drones were easy."

1/31/2014,"i'm bored at work, seen this thread and i remembered an idea that i pitched to ccp fozzie at a bar. and this is prolly the wrong place to put this. but i see ""ideas"" and ""tournaments"" so i decided to shove this here. i'll just reiterate hereduring matches, you have 2 commentators. as fozzie told me one trys to describe what mechanics is going on and how they work. this is usually between breaths of the other guy commentating on the actual fight. and i really mean yelling at the top of his lungs when a shot is fired.usually a lot of stuff is missed on the actual fight. and viewers are confused to all hell. i usually watch tournaments with irl non-eve players. most of my time is spent explaining what exactly is going on and not getting drunk!so my idea/suggestion is this:in other sports, i'll use nascar as a horrible example. (note, i don't watch nascar except when i visit my redneck relatives.) what they do is before/after commercials or during points when stuff is not on fire. they have little 20-30 second segments/animations describing how things work. drafting/cornering/tire wear, etc etc. and they usually do a good job of it.to help ease the commentators during fights and the vast majority of the audienceesp noneve playersis to do similar. quick 20-30 second videos on how tracking works, scan res, the various e-war stuffs. there's a lot of dead air during the tournament to do this. (jita cam for example!) just an idea"

1/31/2014,sorry but no.i don't know about anyone else put personally being on comms when someone jumps instead of bridging is one of the funniest things in eve.plus think of the interesting content that this particular class of derp has caused over the years.
