8/1/2012,"edit: posted by: lazareth toxinthank ******* god!!! someone cares about this disaster as much as i do....this was a complete failure on the part of the ccp ship designers, taking a legendary ships like the vagabond and making them look like regular production ship so they can make their work on the ship skins easier to give us ******* ""hello kittie"" graphics, then sticking some lame ass solar-panel on the side with a few lights to make us feel ok with their changes...what are we idiots or noobs who don't know any better or give a ****???along with the tragic changes to the vagabond, they have in my opinion destroyed the beauty of the faction ships such as the tempest fleet issue by removing it's iconic rectangular fins and other parts of the model and the typhoon fleet issue by removing it's mast scaffolding and fuzzy antennas, not to mention their earlier changes to all turrets which removed all the awesome tech 2 lights leaving all turrets looking like the tech 1 variants and while i'm at it they have over scaled the projectile turrets and made the architecture look clumsy and senseless.ccp seems to have taken on a new game model and that is to make everything in eve as simple and reproducible as possible to create an environment within the design departments of ccp that produces faster and cheaper, which is destroying the original creative works that have made eve a uniquely beautiful and amazing experience.i am really into the way my ships look and work as well as fly and fight and that is why i have stripped my multi-billion isk tempest fleet issue and typhoon fleet issue and placed them on the marker and will be doing the same to all my vagabonds very soon...i once was a very proud minmatar pilot and now i wish i was amarrian!!!and by the way ... this ^^"

8/1/2012,"easily the best suggestions for lowsec i've ever seen, props!ccp, please take note!"
8/1/2012,"i recently discovered (because i'm an fw noob) that it is possible for a system in fw to be contested beyond 100%. far, far beyond 100%, it may not be capped so 300% contested is apparently possible.this can be done so that the system can be offensively plexed indefinitely, allowing for a constant source of lp payouts. by forcing multiple systems into vulnerable and not flipping them, a militia can 'queue up' a large number of systems that can be farmed for lp until they are ready to flip them all in one go and push for a high level warzone control tier boost in one hit. because they are able to push the systems far beyond 100% contested, it becomes impractical for the defending militia to do much about this. defensive plexing is both boring and does not reward the pilot doing it so there is little incentive to spend long hours trying to resecure the system. its just not fun and is a poor way to spend your free time.mechanics should always encourage players to capture a system when possible, so i suggest that a cap is placed on contesting (to make defence viable) and for rewards to be reconsidered so that system conquest is preferable to system farming.edit: seems i wasn't clear enough. i am not asking for lp to be paid out for defensive plexing. i do think that the rewards for factional warfare in general should be reassessed, but i do not think that handing out lp for running defensive plexes is a good idea.this proposal is about adding a cap on pushing systems beyond vulnerable status and on ceasing to pay out lp for offensive plexing in systems that have already reached vulnerable status. the jotunn risi are now recruiting, brutor ancestry required in order to best represent the brutor interest. join channel joris to learn more!"
8/1/2012,"and my first thoughts on what to do about this, separated from the problem part.consider the narrative of this situation. the empire factions use their capsuleer militias as essentially mercenary forces to fight their proxy war. we are rewarded for our efforts in helping to take territory from their mortal foes. capture enemy facilities/kill enemy ships until a system becomes vulnerable, then take it. receive rewards in the form of faction goodies. except, that isn't happening here. instead we are seeing the mercenaries deliberately prolonging the fighting in order to extract greater payment.wouldn't the employer eventually refuse to keep paying for a job that isn't being finished? shouldn't it always be in the interests of the players to conquer a system rather than to leave it in enemy hands?when ccp introduced incursions, they used an interesting phrase;currently, the empire factions don't care about that. maybe they should. ;) there could be several solutions to this issue. place a cap on how far past 100% contested a system can be taken. after that point completing sites ceases to pay out lp and the system can't be taken to a ridiculous level. have the contested level fall over time, perhaps scaling with the extent of contesting to make it harder to push far beyond 100%. like in incursions, move part of the lp rewards for offensive plexing over to paying out only once the system has been captured (or grant additional rewards beyond current level). this might need a time limit of sorts, so that only sites completed within 7 days of the system being taken pay out the bonus. you get paid as you go, and again for finishing the job. the jotunn risi are now recruiting, brutor ancestry required in order to best represent the brutor interest. join channel joris to learn more!"

8/1/2012,"this is precisely what all this is about. someone who preaches the same old boring and wrong message. the ships i and my friends lost were tanked (t2 total defence fit with ecm drones), we were watchig local, we did d-scan, we were flying with others ... and still lost ships in 0.7 systems to alpha strike destoyers.go look at the killboards, you troll. no wait, ccp already did that - and realised that tanked exhumers were going down all over the place and that the risk/reward/cost ratios were totally off, and they have responded by making major changes to mining ships.aslo zim, you say alpha needed to be made so strong because logistics have become so strong. that shows precisely the kind of bad design calls ccp has been making over the past few years. i agree, logistics can be insane. but i didn't add rigs to the game, or make t2 rigs combined faction gear rediculously overpowered. none of the rubish changes to combat over the past few years is my fualt whatsoever - but it is the fault of people like you, 'lord zim"", for not giving ccp timely and accurate feedback on issues, and generating better options on how to fix emerging issues. i love new mods. are they balanced? no, the latest ones lead to some rediculous outcomes from a game design point of view - but i am not venturing into saying how pvp between combat ships should be balanced, that is not an area i honestly care much about. i do however care when bad design calls lead to gameplay that makes my friends quit eve (and they have over hulkageddon) and i applaud ccp for fronting up with new ship designs. now i would love to see them send out a ""come back to eve, get a free exhumer"" e-mail to everyone who unsubbed and who has an exhumer loss on thier account from the past 3 months. end of the day this is about paying customers playing and enjoying the game - stop being so livid that just for once ccp is paying attention to miners rather than listening to the flawed rantings of the pvp / pro greifing crowds. so ccp ... how about adding that gas mining ship next?"
8/1/2012,"uh, no. my ""magstabs"" happen to be 2x mlu ii for higher m3/min (aka, dps). granted, this is primarily used in quiet systems. anywhere with neutrals gets ""tank"" over ""gank"" (i.e. mining yield)... ... though it doesn't stop me from losing hulks to stupid reasons ... like the pos getting 'sploded"
8/1/2012,and that is a hassle if you change fleets allot like in incursions.i think there should be predefined overviews for wartargets fleet only . don't think that it would be to hard to fix implement. but who knows how the source code to this is.....[url=

8/2/2012,supporting for greater justice
8/2/2012,thread is just the reason why we should have unlikes.op unliked (gosh if only we could....).
8/2/2012,"i am here to state my agreement with ugleb. something, and it can be any number of things, needs to be done about the current system. in the current state, it is not in the best interest to conquer a vulnerable system for your own militia as it not only removes a farming ground for you and your allies but also grants your enemies a system to farm loyalty points in, themselves. there's also the fact that in conquering a system, your enemies might not be willing to flip the system themselves when they get make it vulnerable, because it'd remove their own farming ground as well."
8/2/2012,"i can't help but think that the lack of reward for defensive plexing also plays a part.what is the point of defensive plexing a 95% contested system when you can wait for it to flip (assuming the mechanic isn't being abused to 'lock' a system) and then offensive plex for profit.my suggestion, have exactly the same reward as offensive plexing but use the contested percentage as the multiplier.for example:20k lp plex * 90% contested system = 18k lp payout20k lp plex * 0.7% contested system = 140 lp payouti think that is a fair 'reward vs risk' that ccp are concerned about."
8/2/2012,"i agree people shouldn't keep getting lp for doing plexes after a system is vulnerable. whether they can make it more contested by doing plexes for free i think that is debatable. beyond that this is just another minmatar thread asking for lp for defensive plexing. to that i say:if you want to defend your system you should do it by killing the war targets who are running offensive plexes. not by waiting for the war targets to leave and then running a defensive plex. there are many many good reasons not to have lp for defensive plexing. amarrs main method to make a comeback was based on no lp for defensive plexing. if ccp changes the rules and allows lp for defensive plexing i think you see nulli sticking around and farming defensive plexes just like they are farming plexes in systems that are already vulnerable. the compeling reason to not award lp for defensive plexing is that it gives some reason to continue to fight for the side that is currently down. i would rather they did away with defensive plexing altogether. force the winning side to actually fight the offensive plexer in order to ""defend"" their system. ""defending"" your system by running a plex when wartargets aren't even present is lame and deserves no reward.the other option would be to make a player have to pay lp in order to have his defensive plex lower the amount the system is contested. in sum the system is liekly too lopsided for the winning side. we don't need to make it more lopsided. but here are some other reasons its good not to give lp for dplexing.1) encourages the defending side to stop plexers in pvp before they capture a plex so that they do not need to orbit a button for no pay. defensive plexing is best understood as punishment for not defendig your system properly in pvp. 2) gives some reason to join the side with fewer systems since although your lp is worth very little you have more opportunities to make lp through plexing. it also limits the winning sides ability to make lp through plexing. yes they can still make lp from missions but that does not help their occupancy efforts and if enough people switch over to missioning instead of plexing then the side with fewer systems is given some respite.3) it can lead to a war where many systems become vulnerable or close to vulnerable and then flipped in a dramatic fashion. sort of the topic of this thread. as i mention this can lead to all of the militia getting the isk needed to sustain constant pvp. 4) its sort of neat to use individual greed as a balance. 5) if you want to farm systems where your enemy can't even dock then eve offers that already. sov null sec. i think sov null sec could greatly benefit from a system like this where you are rewarded for taking over new space instead of just sitting in your space and farming it. imo, that is a big reason why null sec has been so boring for the last few years. by forcing people to take over new space in order to gain isk you encourage conflict. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
8/2/2012,"this is actually ******* brilliant. makes de-plexing the more highly contested systems worthwhile. due to the fact that they are highly contested, they will likely also be fought over, i'd imagine. this is a way to add more incentive to combat!"
8/2/2012,"you can not upgrade a system, to hit higher tiers, that is is not owned by your militia. so you want to hold as many systems as you can for as long as you can. but yes killing offensive plexers in pvp and preventing the system from being contested in the first place is the optimal way to do this. defensive plexing is something that you should rarely have to resort to and having to do it for no lp is somewhat of a punishment for letting the enemy capture so many plexes to begin with. this is a very good thing ccp has done. there is nothing wrong with the current lp payout structure. why is rewarding defensive plexing good for the game again? you are rewarding players for sitting back while the enemy oplexes thier system without a fight. then after they leave you can get in your vigil and d-plex and get more lp!make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
8/2/2012,"i'm going to stop you right there. neither the op nor my follow up post containing suggestions even mentions adding a reward for defensive plexing. the issue i am raising here is that the mechanics currently favour not flipping systems, which is not how things 'should' work.i also try very hard to look at the mechanics from both sides, i'm not arguing for a change because i think it would suit my militia. this thread might be started by a player who happens to be in the minmatar militia, but it is not intended to become a 'minmatar thread'. please don't pigeon hole me so quickly.if i want to beat the pro-minmatar drums, i'll post on the igs. the jotunn risi are now recruiting, brutor ancestry required in order to best represent the brutor interest. join channel joris to learn more!"
8/2/2012,"ok fair enough. i do agree that vulnerable systems should stop giving lp for capturing complexes beyond that. if the vulnerability decays i think that will then allow people to keep farming systems. plus if one side is truly outnumbered it makes it harder for them to get back to a decent tier. i think the vulnerablility should remain and not decay.the system does not favor ""not flipping"" systems. you do not get any lp benefits unless you start flipping systems. however it does favor timing when you flip systems. but that is a good thing imo. it will add variety.basically you have the ""plexing phase"" where you are either trying to hold on to 80% of the systems or trying to get 80% vulnerable. this phase involves allot of small ship combat. we are in that phase now. then you have the ""flipping phase."" this phase involves allot of larger ship combat. we really never had that phase in the amarr minmatar war. i am interested to see how this plays out. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
8/2/2012,"i have a similar concern, it adds uncertainty and is probably overly complex. i'd prefer a straight forward cap at 100% or just above i think. i just threw that one out as it crossed my mind while bashing keyboard. the jotunn risi are now recruiting, brutor ancestry required in order to best represent the brutor interest. join channel joris to learn more!"
8/2/2012,"bump. seriously, where the hell is this?"

8/2/2012,"very simple and straight forward.add the ability for us to 'save' the current ui setup which would include.- window positions- overview setup- channels open- otherand then allow a different one to be saved. this allows you to have one ui layout for pvp for example, and one ui layout for station spinning or ratting etc.good idea? submitted for your review."
8/2/2012,"if biomass could be converted into something useful, sure. the same way that salvaging a wreck produces useful non-module material such as armor plates and fried interface circuits, <U+FFFD>salvaging<U+FFFD> a frozen corpse might produce usable components in capsuleer-manufactured implant process. or perhaps quafe manufacture. or clones. or high-meta modules."
8/2/2012,"i wonder if this is due to having camera shake turned off?it sounds like the ""wobble"" is due to the camera turning, rather than moving?"
8/2/2012,"@mara rinn - i tested this with camera shake on and with it off. i didn't see any changes, however. the test was only done in station. anyway, it's always been my impression that camera shake is only in play during certain parts of warp and when your ship"
8/2/2012,"it's perfectly normal. camera is not moving. it keeps it place. however, it does rotate slightly, around itself. there is no parallax effect, because camera is not moving (it rotates on axis centered on itself; it does not change position).trying holding right button and move. that's what happens, just on smaller scale. camera rotation does not affect relation of point of view, your ship and background.there is nothing technically wrong with it."
8/2/2012,"the most ironic thing is that of all the things in the game that defy our current understanding of physics, you pick this. the entire game defies our current understanding of physics and more specifically, quantum physics.why don't we start an argument on why we can travel faster than the speed of light in this game, even though current laws dictate that is impossible? same sort of argument as yours op - it's irrelevant and nobody cares.planets are stationary bodies in eve - they don't orbit anything, or move in the slightest. couldn't be further from reality. there are millions of examples like these of how the game defies the laws of physics as we understand them today. that's the fun of a game set in the future - they can do what they want. move on."
8/2/2012,"i'm still hoping to hear from someone who actually remembers (probably well over a year ago now) when the ship actually floated in the station like a real 3d object , and you could see the background behind it shift, disappearing and reappearing slightly behind the image of the ship. perhaps it was always much more noticeable with a large ship, since they tend to be closer to your actual pov (check abdiel's post for a good explanation)."
8/2/2012,"i remember when there was more movement. but still, there is nothing physically wrong with current situation. it's just your preference toward old model."
8/2/2012,"op doesn't know what ""3d"" is. wow...i seriously don't know what to say to this..."
8/2/2012,"you can't expect a significant observable parallax when you're spinning the camera around an object.also, let's encourage ccp to put effort into things that improve the game, not stuff that only gets noticed by anal-retentive people who feel something doesn't look quite right."

8/3/2012,"after reading the csm minutes it seemed that the csm wanted a way to eject inactive members from council and they could not come to an agreement with ccp for a proper system to do so.i suggest a vote of no confidence system.a csm member would put together a document explaining in detail why a vote of no confidence should be held for a specific council member and present it to the chairman for review.this document must have many legitimate reasons why a vote of no confidence should be held. it should be held for purely functional and not political reasons for why a council member should be subject to the vote. it should be held for reasons like but not limited to:does not attend meetingshas attempted to interfere with csm communications to the communitydoes not contribute on the csm forumsdoes not attend skypeand must have irrefutable proof of these absences or transgressions.the chairman then decides weather or not to hold the vote of no confidence. if he/she agrees he/she then holds the vote of no confidence with all council members with the exception of the member for which the vote is being held. the person for which the vote of no confidence is being held must be informed of this imminent threat to there position before and when the vote is being held. all council members must render a single aye or neh response. the councils decision must be completely unanimous. if all are ayes, then the chairman presents the document that was the list of reasons for the vote of no confidence to ccp for the final ruling. if ccp agrees that the member is a non contributing member on the council then the vote of no confidence is passed and a run off is held for the persons seat on the council. in this run off the person who has received the vote of no confidence can rerun to re attain there seat on the council.this system has so many checks and balances present it would be very difficult for a council member to be ejected for political and not functional reasons. this would bring an extra layer of accountability to council members. this system gives ccp a final word on weather or not a csm member can be removed from the council."

8/3/2012,"why is it that when i came to lowsec, i found so many people asking ccp to give them rewards for defending their own ****.the reward is that you get to keep it!"
8/3/2012,didn't want that space anyway (tm).
8/3/2012,you so intimated ? all right if you feel that's your bussiness.
8/3/2012,"so i was reading through the minutes recently posted elsewhere, and for the most part it was informative, but not really all that 'exciting', but what drew my attention was soundwave's bit about ring mining. i'm a miner, but aside from that it drew my attention to ccp's failure to recognize that low/null needs more incentives, and at the same time high sec needs to stop being seen as a starter zone. there will always be those of us who want the lower risk life.ring mining. low/null only? hmph. for a company that seems to have the goal of wanting hi-sec to be a starter zone you guys sure don't act like it. by putting ring mining in low/null only you entice miners out of hi-sec, no doubt. the problem is by not putting them in high-sec, you don't allow people to test them out in a low risk environment. simply lower the yields, the profit. this way the high-sec miners can try it out, and if they like it and want to make real money off it, they move into low/null to pursue it. yes you will have some that will ring mine in high forever regardless, but it ups the chance of migration more than simply saying ""nope you don't get this.""accept that there will always be those who prefer the hi-sec life, those who don't want a target on their back 24/7. everything that's available in low/null should be available in high in a lesser form. this way it allows players to get into it, and gives them some real ideas about what they'd be looking at on other side. now you also need reciprocity though, which isn't there. low/null needs to have all the options of high. industry/mining/pve all of it across the board has to be raised up to the point where it's not just a bit more profitable, but a ton more profitable.simplest way i can think of accomplishing this? high-sec profit values stay as is (except perhaps lvl 3 missions, new players trying to get into lvl 4's are in hell) and maybe add the chance for some faction loot from missioning (not a high one mind you, just enough to give the high-sec'ers a taste of what's out there). then you up low and null by 100-200% across the board. mission rewards, rat bounties, mining (maybe create new variations of the high-sec ores in low sec that are far higher yield), all of it. and maybe consider adding a few concord bastions in 0.0 (a single high-sec sector). one in the north, one south, one east, one west. the safe trade spots. the jita's of low sec.i could go on, but this wall of text is long enough, and i honestly doubt anyone other than the trolls will read it, but i've come to believe if you don't say anything, can't expect any change. so take it for what it is, just some feedback."
8/3/2012,"in my eyes, low and nullsec just don't exist. i have zero interest in anything the two areas have to offer and i won't even consider going back again. low and null simply don't exist to me anymore.and i'm certainly not the only one who shares that mentality. it's not that i'm adverse to pvp, i love it. however the game mechanics and player politics are so unforgivably awful in low and especially null.if ring minging becomes exclusively for low and/or null, then ccp may as well not even waste the effort to create it.the new lowsec gate gun changes look promising, but i worry ccp might cave in to the very small yet very vocal minority who oppose change.summary of eves last four expansions:"
8/3/2012,"you guys do understand that ring mining is for a resource that is currently unavailable in highsec, right?this would change precisely nothing for you."
8/3/2012,"per greyscale, they're also not coming any time soon. it's theorycraft from a csm meeting so far as we know."
8/3/2012,"i question the logic of trying to entice helpless ships into pvp areas.you can add all kinds of value, but if acquisition makes you a sitting duck, it weakens the draw. lowsec content currently favors the aggressor/pirate. that needs to change imho, and there are lots of ways to do it. the problem is that i hear a lot of <U+FFFD>i want more pvp!<U+FFFD> and <U+FFFD>let<U+FFFD>s get more people in lowsec!<U+FFFD> but often really mean <U+FFFD>i want more easy kills that have nice modules.<U+FFFD> that<U+FFFD>s a problem because the aggressors want the odds in their favor.so no, i don<U+FFFD>t think ring mining should be a lowsec only thing. i also think it should be highly dangerous to a ship not specialize/fit for it, esp. in lowsec. i would like to see it mask signatures so that ships are hard to find."
8/3/2012,i also want to safely mine technetium in fleets of skiffs in hisec.
8/3/2012,"as for the points about how its not fair that industrial players shouldn't be forced into low/null.if you don't want to risk going out there, then that's your decision.but the idea is that the people that actually have the balls to do so will reap the rewards.the chain of pvp in low/null goes like this:farmers (ratting ravens are just as helpless as mining barges) get preyed on by solo and small gangs.solo people get preyed on by small gangs and medium gangs.small gangs get preyed on by mid-size gangs.mid-size gangs get preyed on by large gangs.large gangs fight other large gangs.the point is that increased rewards in low/null means that there's more farmers, which means increased pvp across the board. the more people that are in space, potentially dying, the better.but you might say: all i do is hisec industry... what do i care about increased pvp?increased pvp means more ships dying. more ships dying means that the market doesn't stagnate, and that demand remains high. higher the demand, the more money you can make off your products.so even if ccp releases an industry buff to low/null, even the hisec-only players gain from it."
8/3/2012,i propose turning oasa into an npc region or adding an npc region into the drone lands. this i believe would add more activity to the region.
8/3/2012,"a fine, well thought out and highly detailed proposal. i fully support this idea, product and/or service."
8/3/2012,"you totally can. even if ship stands still, background is moving. it's only when camera rotates around itself (""look around"" mode) that ship always covers same area on background, therefore no parallax.as for... there is no lens. camera is literally point that rotates on itself. sure, realistically, there is lens distance and observable parallax (for example, turning your eyes moves lens within the eye, allowing you to see from different pov), but it doesn't happen in most 3d engines."
8/3/2012,"with all the upcoming changes regarding aggression and flagging, i want to toss this idea out. i posted it in another thread, but the more i think about it the more i want to see it.as i understand it, once crimewatch goes live there will be 15 minute times for the suspect and criminal flags. i'm proposing to take that timer and multiply it by a system's security status. flipping a can in a 0.5 system would get you just 7 1/2 minutes of suspect flagging instead of the full 15. piracy in a 0.1 would result in just 90 seconds of flagging, where you would get 6 minutes in a 0.4.this would help blur the lines between high and lowsec, and make those sec levels matter for more than npc spawns."
8/3/2012,"it would also incorporate the existing corner case of ""shut off flags when you're in null"" :)overall, it's very elegant, but it would require quite extensive testing on sisi to see what it does to fights and such."
8/3/2012,"yeah, that's something that crossed my mind, but i didn't really feel the need to include it. i was going for short and sweet :)my expectation would be that both lowsec piracy and highsec ganking would naturally migrate toward the lower-sec systems because the penalties are lighter there. with a shorter gcc timer in 0.5s, gankers could reship sooner. if some variation on the hotly-debated sentry guns changes comes about, lowsec gate camps would be more viable in the lower sec systems. i don't really see a downside...but them i'm not looking at it from the perspective of the carebear who would just as soon see gankers get podded by concord and such."
8/3/2012,"i assume that changing systems after you receive a timer won't alter the timer... and the only system security level that matters is that of the system in which you earned your flag... i think i like this idea!!!!! it does severely limit the ""penalties"" to criminal and suspect activities in lower security systems... it would also be a huge boon to suicide ganking in 0.5 & 0.6 systems..... as proposed, i think you would have to re-balance the gcc & suspect timers. on some level, i think this proposal should be reversed..... i think that the lower the security of a system, the more ""policing"" should fall on players (rather than concord, gate guns, etc). gcc is a concord npc thing, so i'm totally down with lowering that timer with lower system security. however, suspect flags allow players to hunt down and shoot other players, and i actually think that should be extended with lower system security. perhaps couple it with a mechanic to help wanna-be police players (aka spam) pragmatically hunt down players that currently have a suspect flag, and you have some awesome potential."
8/3/2012,"doing otherwise would probably be a nightmare for the devs and runs contrary to my vision of how it should work, so...yes.the impact it would have on highsec ganking is that you could gank in a 0.5 twice as frequently as you could in a 1.0. i don't expect any adjustments would need to be made. that really depends on things like sentry gun mechanics. if greyscale's sentries come into play along with crimewatch, then we really do need a mechanic that will shorten the duration of the suspect flag the further you get from secure space.remember that you can always shoot a pirate with a -5 sec status, and that if they've recently killed you, you have kill rights on them and can engage them anywhere. the suspect and criminal flags are intended to allow everyone to shoot you without losing their own sec status. a long time ago i posted an idea for creating concord ""deputy"" players and corporations where they would be alerted to local gcc events as beacons on their overview. i would imagine that's similar to your idea."
8/3/2012,not supported because the proposed suspect system is terrible.
8/3/2012,"from the current state, the impact is you can suicide gank twice as frequently in 0.5 systems than currently.... this is a big boon to suicide ganking (although that's not a bad thing necessarily). i'm not referring to pirates. imagine i'm a suicide ganker that makes a living ganking industrials traveling through niarja (0.5). with your change, i can now gank twice as often, since my gcc & aggression timers are now 7.5m instead of 15m. i'm suggesting, that your gcc (which controls concord response) gets reduced to 7.5m, but your suspect timer (which allows other players to shoot you) is increased to 30 m (extreme example). now, i can go suicide ganking again very quickly (after 7.5ish m becuase that's when my gcc ends), but i must fear some good samaritan player that tries to thwart my operation by attacking me before i can gank another industrial (which they could do as long as i have the suspect flag). there are two things i'm not very certain of: 1.) for lowsec: gate & station gun mechanics. currently, when you go gcc, you get attacked by gate and station guns. but when you go gcc, you also gain an npc aggression timer to the gate gun owners. gate and station guns will automatically shoot you whenever you get near them until both the gcc timer and npc aggression timer ends. whenever the guns do shoot at you, you're npc timer is renewed, and sometimes your gcc timer is also renew (i think). i'm not sure how these timers are changing with the new crimewatch system. what i hope for, is that gate guns only fire at you while you have a gcc flag, but will leave you alone when you have the suspect flag. this way, a short gcc timer means you only have to worry about station guns and gate guns for a short period of time, and a long suspect timer means good samaritans can freely aggress you for an extended period of time! i want to enhance player on player violence, which this is directly doing!!! i am not certain how gcc & suspect timers will be renewed, and that's also an important thing to consider. 2.) for highsec: player aggression timers vs gcc timers. imagine i'm a miner in a belt. a talos lands and attempts to suicide gang me. i deploy ec drones which jam out the talos,which then dies to concord. the talos currently gets a 15 minute gcc timer for his actions, meaning if he boards a spaceship within highsec during that window, concord will spawn and blow him up. you want to reduce this timer to 7.5 minutes in a 0.5 system. however, there is another timer of major concern here! because i aggressed the talos with ec drones, i have a 15 minute agression timer with the talos pilot. so, with the gcc changes, 8 minutes later that pilot can be back in a new talos in space hunting me down. if he finds me before my 15 minute agression timer ends, he can legally shoot me without concord intervention because of the timer i have for defending myself. this loophole needs to be closed!! i'm under the impression that a major point in changing crimewatch is to reduce the ""who can shoot at who branching crazy timers madness"" that is currently crimewatch. i'm very uncertain how the new crimewatch system will deal with defensive timers (i.e. how/when can the talos pilot return fire.) this could be a simple change of reducing the ""return fire"" timer to the same length of the gcc, but i don't fully understand the new system yet. again, it's not so much as gcc events that i care about, as much as suspect events. gcc gets handled by concord and gate guns. suspect events should be handled by players... i've read/heard/thought/discussed overview beacons to allow spam to chase down such pilots, but i haven't seen anything that seemed appropriately balanced."
8/3/2012,"can you elaborate why the proposed suspect system is terrible??? it opens up aggression to all players, which is a good thing..."
8/3/2012,"i think it's a rather terrible idea that sentry guns will shoot you for taking stuff that has been jettisoned into space. i'm against crimewatch, but ccp doggedly insists upon it, so i'm making the best of a bad situation by trying to temper it."
8/3/2012,"i'll give a few reasons and short explanations; i'm not trying to derail the thread:1.) it eliminates current canflipping mechanics as valid ways to gain aggression for 1v1s, arranged fights, making sure you don't get concorded for shooting your mission mate, etc.2.) it isn't as newbie-friendly as its intention since if you screw up and loot your friends', alt's, etc. can you are now flagged to everyone rather than yourself/your friend and most likely get exploded.3.) it imposes a clear sense of morality on various actions that were previously left entirely in the hands of the players.4.) it removes a non-trivial reason to join a corp for miners and missioners--mutual defense (i.e. currently if you steal you are flagged to the corporation that you stole from, now you will be flagged to everyone regardless of whether your target was in an npc or player corp).5.) it's basically going to kill off can flipping, wreck stealing, etc. in high security space. while this is mainly used as a form of griefing, it can still result in good fights and ccp used to take the stance that more things exploding=better.6.) the changes are poorly thought out, as evidenced by developer posts in other threads about the topic (e.g. there were originally going to be invincible logis).7.) these radical changes are not needed. all that was asked for/really necessary was changes to neutral rr. if you want to make can flipping less of a newbie ganking tactic and more of a sandbox thing, simply make sure to include more detailed instructions on aggression mechanics in the tutorial. additionally, expand the current aggression flagging system to include alliances, not just corporations. put things in the hands of player groups, don't create a global flag for things as silly as property theft.8.) recent discussion of this sentry gun thing reinforces points 6 and 3. sentry guns shooting you for can theft? really?these are just off the top of my head. i'll add more if i think of them later.the bottom line is that the proposed suspect system introduces a global flag for actions that do not give the suspect/aggressor any additional options in terms of perpetrating a criminal act, shooting another ship, etc. this is a huge departure from what eve has been. imo, it represents a significant shift in ccp's/eve's direction as a game to become much, much softer and more carebear-esque. i will be unsubscribing if these changes take effect, not because i'm a can flipper extraordinaire, but because i can see the writing on the wall. these changes don't matter too much now, but i can see where the game will be 1-2 years after these changes and would much rather take my money elsewhere.i think i just derailed the thread. floppie, scaling gcc in particular between the low/high barrier makes perfect sense, but i'm not sure you're going to be able to scale gcc within .5-1.0 due to how it would enable increased suicide ganking. additionally, it doesn't make sense to me for gcc to scale within .5-1.0... the police know you did something bad, and they're going to blow you up and mark you down. .5 is the inner city and they might take longer to respond, but there's still a warrant out for your arrest."
8/3/2012,"this is my understanding of crimewatch, although i could be wrong: 1.) if i take from a can that isn't mine, i gain a suspect flag (for stealing, a minor criminal act). with a suspect flag, everyone can legally shoot me. if they shoot me, i can shoot them back. if the person i'm returning fire on has logistics support, i'm s.o.l., as i cannot shoot their logi pilot, meaning i'm at a big disadvantage when i've gone suspect (which is the tade-off for stealing the loot). if i rep a player with a suspect flag, i gain the suspect flag. *edit* i've read the minutes on sentry gun aggro. i don't think sentries or npc's should get involved in suspect fights. i also don't think it's acceptable for gate guns to be able to kill triaged carriers within 5 minutes. however, ccp clearly said these were not set in stone, and would be discussed at an upcoming date/forum. 2.) if i illegally shoot another player, i gain a criminal flag (like gcc) and a suspect flag. the criminal flag means that gate & station guns shoot me, navy's attack, and concord will deathray me. in general, shooting anything that is not yours or your corps is illegal with the following exceptions: you have a wardec, you have killrights, they are currently flagged as a suspect, or you are defending your ship from their aggression. if you assist (rep) a ciminally flagged player, you become criminally flagged. i'm sure i'm leaving something off, but i don't understand how this is terrible? perhaps i need to go read some dev post i missed, in which case please point me in that direction!"
8/3/2012,"thank you for your responses.... i think life is far, far more entertaining when you are valid target everyone as opposed to a single corp. and your much, much more likely to get fights and escalations when you increase the number of people that can shoot at you. this will hurt wreck-bating mission runners and can flipping miners, but i don't think this will hurt anyone that actually partakes in pvp. invulnerable logi's suck..... and this should be fixed somehow.... i'd recommend a samaritan flag, where shooting a suspect gives you the samaritan flag and aiding (reps) a samaritan gives you a samaritan flag. when you have a samaritan flag, all suspects can legally shoot you.... make the samaritan flag only 2 minutes, or something very short compared to the suspect flag. gate guns shooting suspects is pretty ********, and this should be fixed so they only shoot criminals. in my experience, can flipping is about ganking, not about 1v1's. i'm fairly certain they are working on a 1v1 mechanic to replace can flipping. as long as ccp doesn't prevent you from doing something immoral, who cares about the morality of an action? it still sounds like suspect actions will be in the hands of players to punish. these changes are to make the server run smoother and simplify the crimewatch system (which is bloated, and awkward, and difficult to work around). furthermore, the global flagging system is setup purposely to put enforcement in the hands of players... it's just extending the playerbase that can enforce it from a single player or corp to all players."
8/3/2012,the incentive is that you get to keep your system. is that not reason enough?
8/3/2012,"hello,i was thinking of, maybe it'd be time to also care about the vets, and not just about the new players.as of this i'm thinking of focusing on things that are annoyance and sometimes broken, and they are a real pita for the longterm player. which, being honest, are present in big quantities in the game. also, some of these stuff also can annoy the new players, like things being inconvenient.to get actual examples, i'm listing a few stuff here to get the idea:gui ergonomy: - why having the option to copy/pe/me a bp_c_, if that's impossible? or reverse engineering something that can't be... - why do i have to put something into the market quickbar from the search tab (i know this is being changed) to get the ""find in contracts"" option? - why do i have to open the charinfo dialog of a corp's ceo to get the ""send message"" option in the rclick menu? it should be right there... - why can't i promote an arbitrary system to be a waypoint in the ap? instead of this, why do i have to manually add/readd/whatever the stuff to get this done? - why don't we have an option to open a ship's smb/chb, just like opening a regular cargo can? seems like the logical way to do it - multiline tabs for the chat windowgui consistency: - standing dialogs. different for poss, outposts, pocos, contacts, etc. why not unify them?broken stuff: - the remote manufacturing/r&d skills ought to work on assets in space. (this shouldn't be fixed by putting this limitation into the descriptions of these skills).we're facing suchlike things on a daily bases, and these are not really improving our game experience. and also, the newbies don't understand things (like rclick options for bpcs), and it's misleading to them."
8/3/2012,"with pos becoming modular **hopefully** it will improve the life living out of a worm hole. i totally agree currently it sucks trying to manage a pos to live out of in w-space. hopefully ccp takes some pointers from the modular pos system.i totally agree, that there needs to be some form of personal storage set up for pos, it does not have to be comfortable, to live out a pos, you might not be able to 'dock' like a station, but having something that would allow, repackaging of items, and personal storage space would improve the current system 100% fold. being able to claim sov in wh, i really cannot support, nor could i support stations in wh space.i could support an x-large pos that is only deploy able in wh space that can be destroyed. that acts similar to a station concept is a good idea.logistics in and out of a worm hole is a big enough pain in the ass as it is. having a spot to safely store personal assets would be a huge improvement. and totally supported."

8/4/2012,"this post is a copy from my post in the tutorial revamp thread, i think it better fits here.just a little idea for the tutorials:have npcs that can show up in your captain quarters and tell you something about the game. what you can do with them:1. let them tell you what they have to say (""next"" through the main dialogue)2. ask questions from a list (queries to a database, gives a random list from the available dialogues of that npc.)3. send them to hell (vote them down, they will never come back to you)4. add them to contacts (subscribe)the nasty idea behind it: have the players create those dialogues. points 3 and 4 are there to get a ranking of those npcs. for point 1 and 2 we would need a convincing interface to build dialogues, but that shouldnt be too hard if it is text based. making npcs with the charakter editor is easy, that is already there. they just need a little script for coming into the room and leaving and some gesture while they talk.players can share their knowledge with noobies, do a bit of advertising for themsevles and their organization (which leads new guys to corps faster) and fluff out the universe.educational corporations will add a great lot of helpfull stuff into such a system. and i think many people will love to make a cool/funny/whatever guy and put a lot of effort in it.the downside is: i dont exactly know if the voting system is enough to prevent misuse by spammers and scammers. but wikis work, so why shouldnt this one work?when this runs a while, you can go through the highly voted list and adapt some of the dialogues for the official help (have own npcs wich ""cite"" the player made ones. give some credits )this would not only give players a new thing to explore, it would also add meaningful functionality to the captains quarters. of course it also could be done in a com window like talking to an agent, but i think the captains quarters and the functionality of a scriptable npc avatar (just have some emote tags in the dialogues when you create them which trigger animation) would be awesome."

8/4/2012,because there are components used in capital ship production that aren't used in normal tech 1 ship production. i made my post small to show a general trend and get people thinking. i'm impressed that i got even a few intelligent replies (yours included). it is a huge leap from the norm--when i give the answers in my post and people jump in and flame me because they disagree with things they didn't even bother to read.1.) the simple solution is to increase the amount of non-standard materials used in capital ship production.2.) the net result will be an increase in capital ship price and a decrease in capital ship numbers.
8/4/2012,"i'm inclined to believe you're joking or trolling, but the way you worded the rest of that paragraph tells me otherwise.i'll make this easy for you to understand: in eve, numbers matter a lot. in general, when two individual ships united together in combat against one ship are evenly matched, the two ships are only marginally cheaper than the one. if a carrier could tank 30 battleships all by itself, then it should cost more than a titan. as long as it only costs as much as a handful of battleships, people who can fly carriers would almost exclusively fly carriers since they would almost never lose them.as it stands, a carrier has several times the tank of a tier-3 battleship. it should probably cost at least 50 times as much, simply by virtue of its fleet combat value."

8/4/2012,"people actually still do stuff for money in hisec?e:there already exists a venue where you can sample pretty much anything you want, anywhere you want, skills permitting:it's called the singularity test-server, more commonly ""sisi.""as for the rest of the op:how about......no.1/10.next!"
8/4/2012,"actually that's incorrect, if you merely point your probes at hisec moons, minerals are there, it's the extraction array anchoring restriction that stops us from getting at them."
8/4/2012,"my point is that this logic only will draw in those willing to take high risk for moderate rewards. there are common complaints about lowsec being too steep of an increase in risk for a marginal increase in rewards. any edge taken off that risk will increase the amount of people in lowsec. that is another complaint: too few people in lowsec. solo/small gang pvpers need to ask for more challenging victims. failure to take their needs and survival rates into account has led us to where we are. people want to get out there, but the risks vs. reward needs re-balancing. mindsets need to change."

8/4/2012,"don't get me wrong, i'm not against the idea but perhaps some additional detail would be in order.who would be moving in and under what reasoning line?what would they offer to attract people?etc.there's certaintly a few factions that could fill the gap, but for the proposal to carry weight it needs detail."
8/4/2012,"terrible idea. the penalty for podding is a sec status hit. now your proposing the survivor 'usually the aggressor' gets to salvage what could potentially be 1.25 billion or more in implants. i see toons with absolutely no impulse controll all the time getting themselves richer by simply creating a toon capable of ganking a highsec miner, then turning 10% to 20% of the value of an intact barge (now a wreck) into another ship to rinse and repeat. give those same toons the idea that they can hit the motherload, and you will find shuttle wrecks all over empire as toons try to win the lottery. all players know that the isk spent on implants is lost as soon as you plug it in. lesson: sec status hit does not supress missed ritalin doses, the possibility that over a billion isk can be gotten from a pod, is already in place it is called the bounty system.things that keep me up at night;<U+FFFD> why do we use a voice communication device to send telegraphs? moore's law should state,<U+FFFD>once you have paid off the last pc upgrade you will need another."

8/4/2012,this is one of the better ideas i've seen for fleshing out the cq a little. and to integrate something that can be quite useful would be awesome.market feeds could be added with a reasonable delay so that it isn't constantly locking up as well.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
8/4/2012,"i can definitely understand people saying there are more important issues in the game when i see my nightmare bisect an abaddon on leaving a station, lol. not much we can do about that. i don't mind it, really. it is unique. the way it worked in station before cq was the background image of the station did not float. it only moved in response to you moving your camera around... and you could spin your ship all day but the station was rock solid. the only thing that floated then was your ship. what we saw then was real ""3d"".somehow, someone messed up the code, and when they did, everything started floating together:"

8/5/2012,"+5 for me ceo, and past alliance industrial directorthis one issue is a major bar to recruitment into corps and also hurt newbies from getting in the better indy corps.to those who say ccp is not listening check out the section of discussion on corp revam"
8/5/2012,"this is an excellent idea. implement it as is, right now! moar pvp!!!!"
8/5/2012,in what way?
8/5/2012,"+1has the csm cared to reply to this thread? i know they have dev and gm tags, but i don't remember seeing thread tags for csm or isd.can we get some kind of communication from the csm about this?????"
8/5/2012,"ccp please read this is the kind of thing you need to do to make lowsec more popular, not destroy it even morethese are ideas collected from various places, some mine, many others make lowsec a place not just a crap mechanic"
8/5/2012,"please do something about this, it mainly affects the incursion community but would have affects elsewhere (like with the war cool downs). basically what people have been doing is wardeccing small corps who do incursions with alts which have just enough skils to dec someone or is an alt they are not planning on using for that week (for example ready for chaos is deccing my corp and its only member is the ceo which has been in that corp for 30 days). the point of these decs is not to go to war, its more to cause problems with communities which are vulnerable to ""space aids"". the incursion community didn't care about these corps until someone used the existing 1 man corp notifications to slip in a much larger corp. please do something about this, my suggestion would be to require a min number of non trial characters before you can wardec (something small like 5)"
8/5/2012,"one man corps already got hit pretty hard by the inferno changes. it's really not that hard to shut down a one man corp. also, you might want to post a solution rather than omg do something."
8/5/2012,i did post a solution: my suggestion would be to require a min number of non trial characters before you can wardec (something small like 5)and how would you go about shutting one of these down?
8/5/2012,"your solution was contained in a single sentence of the post and was also terrible, so i didn't really count it as a solution.as to how to shut them down, shoot the guy. set a trap. if you're really lazy and feel like spending your time, camp him in station. the bottom line is, if you get all tied up in how much isk/hr you're losing by camping him or chasing after him, you're going to lose. it's your choice not to pursue him if your corporation's members feel that they should off making money instead, just don't be surprised when he picks you off one by one."
8/5/2012,"vulnerability should be limted to 100%.after all, it's not possible to make a system ""more"" stable.the idea being, once vulnerable, the system needs to be flipped quickly, before it's defended.no lp for offensive plexing an already vulnerable system."
8/5/2012,"the problem with your proposal, dear nerois that the carrier already costs as much as 10 battleships... but it can't tank 10 battleships without triage or spider tanking awesomeness. nor can it attack anything smaller than a bs without much difficulty or waiting 2 years to target something... don't get me started on warping out or after something compared to the bs....flawed argument is flawed.and while were talking about numbers that mean allot... the sheer lack of approvals and or likes attributed to you or your ideas indicate a severe lack of understanding or buy in from the masses...."
8/5/2012,cost of production is almost never a limiting factor. supercarrier and titan proliferation proved this all too well.what will happen is that you raise the bar for a small entity to get a carrier or dreadnought while doing nothing to curb their mass production by larger entities.
8/5/2012,"there is no force. people solo mine and pvp in lowsec all the time. it does work better if you work with a group, or at least backup to call in.that said, sitting in a paper thin shell of a ship where any one is allowed to come in and shoot you is a bad idea.also, imho and experience, nullsec is safer than lowsec. the group i worked with at the time showed up faster than concord when i needed help. my lowsec experiences were less pleasant."

8/6/2012,"yeah i read that yesterday, my one concern was that it was a single paragraph explaining the problem, but no comment from ccp if they acknowledge/agreed or such. i hope it gets more attention."
8/6/2012,"if you dont want to be war decked then move to the noob npc corp.or, join a bigger corp.or, deffend yourself.don't come crying to the forums with poorly thought out ideas that are simply a brain-fart response to ""what change can i make that makes my specific situation safer""jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
8/6/2012,"a single week old character who doesnt even log on can bring an entire incursion running corp/alliance to its knees?gosh, you incursionbears are worse at eve than i thought"
8/6/2012,"wow. afk cloakers are killing nullsec, one-man wardecs are killing incursions, gankers are killing miners...pretty soon all that will be left is the alliances that can see to their own security, the w-space crowd that wonder what this ""local"" thing is, and highsec griefers."
8/6/2012,i fail to see how this is a bad thing
8/6/2012,grow some balls?
8/6/2012,"it would be fair to allow it to be pushed just past vulnerable otherwise the first minor would decontest it. should not need to be more than 105% or so.still feel the emphasis should be on forcing a conclusion to the contested status. that could mean and increase in the rewards for capture, starting taken systems at a higher default upgrade level than.ultimately, system capture should be an event that should not go unopposed; this possibly means an objective for the defender when the structure bashing begins. if it is repped/defended enough then the defenders get rewards and a % chunk is taken of the contested state, probably not back to zero though."
8/6/2012,this makes sense. some small buffer so that when you come in with the big ships to hit the bunker the other side doesn't just run a minor plex. but the italics part i do not understand. why force a conclusions to vulnerable status? it is what will allow militias to hit tier five. if we have to immediately flip systems the small amount of strategy and planning for the big flipping stage is eliminated and plexing becomes a constant grind where both sides will be lucky to hit tier 3 or 4. for example i tend to think that when one side decides to start flipping systems there will be large scale fights. it may not happen for amarr minmatar when amarr ultimately flips systems but that would be because of the null sec entities on the amarr side. the minmatar might not have the larger ships to bring. but usuallly i think we will find their will be more fights than there was when we just flipped systems immediately. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
8/6/2012,"i thought about having vulnerability a small amount above 100%.if the vulnerability is ever above 100% (including right now on tq!) it should be visible to everyone.however, i'm not sure the buffer makes sense.having to think about managing the plexes while hitting the bunker seems like a good thing to me.and the wiki seems to suggest this is how it's intended to work."
8/6/2012,good idea.
8/6/2012,"i agree theres something wrong with system control mechanics atm, however because i currently dont have a well thought out idea, ill let ccp think about it. first we need to make them aware of the problem."
8/6/2012,"hello all,well i can already sense the posts that may come, but maybe there will be some positive ones.living in 0.0 yes can be a little risky etc, but there are somethings in eve that are not right, like being able to push one button and you can litterly lose alot of assets, even for some years and years of work. yes just one click and thats it.what i am taking about is - kick members/corps and/or disbanding alliances. if a corp gets kicked from a 0.0 sov alliance that owns stations their assets are locked there forever, could be loads and loads of ships for lots of different members. yes there may have bene a legit reason they got kicked, but there is also people who lick to just kick corps for no reason. and all this takes is one director to click one button. really? again when bob got disbanded took only one person to do that, and years of work down the drain. is this really right?once kicked you are locked out of any stations etc to get your assets. yes you could try get your assets out by paying an insider, but in all honesty you are probably going to get scammed or blown up in the process rather than finding an honest person. should many people lose some much with such an easy action? i dont believe so.no i am not saying i have the answer to this, but surely this needs to be looked at. i know some people may also state keep your assets in npc stations. yes of course do that, but there are also needed in main bases too. be interested to get your thoughts, even though i probably know what to expect.hopefully we can get some adult answers."
8/6/2012,"i'm not a nullsec resident, so this is an honest question: shouldn't you be able to set up courier contracts to get the stuff out? that way you could secure it with collateral and have it moved to an npc station.you might want to look into having whichever frog service runs nullsec shipments see if they could get it out. they seem to have a fair bit of access."
8/6/2012,"afaik, black frog is only in the initial phase of negotiating with sovholders for station access..."
8/6/2012,"yes black frog even with alliances that have blue standings, dont currently enter 0.0 sov stations. be good if that could be sorted."
8/6/2012,"there should be like a 10, 20, or 30 day period that you could remove your stuff after being notified of the expulsion."
8/6/2012,"this, and ratings boards (such as the esrb) would need to review the changes (tobacco use) and possibly even change the age rating of the game depending. plus, these ratings are not free. i like the idea but the hassle associated with it would be extreme."
8/6/2012,i support this.i think fw mechanic is broken.
8/6/2012,rib how many times has an afk cloaker killed you?how many times has an afk cloaker done something that prevented you from going about your business?pro-tip: the answer is 0.
8/6/2012,"super simple but effective. there are many people that go afk in eve, and pretty much type afk in a channel to show this. obviously people that come in later dont see this message. we have offline and online 'lights' can we have another light that we can set manually (amber or blue) to denote we are afk.also when this is set and we convo people we are not sat there waiting for ages for them to reply or them waiting for us. a simple message to state the user is afk would be really useful.and quite easy to implement.edit : this should be a manual setting, set by the user."
8/6/2012,"not so stealthy cry about cloakies thread.counter proposal: no. htfu. if you want intel on how active another player is or what they're doing, go out and work for it instead of begging for hand outs. d-scan, probes, covering entrances/exits, etc."
8/6/2012,"this is whats wrong with this game, people like you, with some intense paranoia. this has got nothing to do whatsoever about afk cloaking rubbish, what the the hell are you talking about. this is basically putting something in place to show you are afk, and also the people who trying to contact you know you are afk. thats it. if you want to look at it with some paronoid metagaming facility then you do that."
8/6/2012,"oh please, don't pretend this isn't about cloakies. for people you're trying to contact? ha. know how you know if they're afk? they don't respond. simple."
8/6/2012,"seriously its not...but if you want to keep on thinking that then hey you do that. also i would prefer when i come back from afk that i dint have lots of convo windows too. also why would i be bothered if it was about detecting afk cloakies? im not, anyway that wouldnt even serve a purpose, even if i did know a cloakie was afk, i still wouldnt be able to find him so there would be no point, so seriously think about what you are saying, before just trolling."
8/6/2012,"well if this was about afk cloakies, rather than a none existing issue about knowing whether the person you're talking to is afk, you - ahem i mean not you, since you super duper definitely aren't talking about cloakies! - would know when someone in local isn't a threat, allowing all the mining, missioning and other carebearing to be done in absolute safety. i think coding a mechanic to tell you that the person who isn't responding to you may not be there to respond to you offers so little benefit to begin with that it isn't worth the time and money, but when you throw in the fact that it 'breaks' certain mechanics or meta-gaming (which you so definitely absolutely aren't really talking about, nope no way) then it's not even up for debate. it's a big fat nope."
8/6/2012,"let's settle this argument with a simple idea: make the ""away"" status a toggle option, not automatic. there, now you can be afk and pretend not to be, while legit people who are afk can still let the world know."
8/6/2012,"exactly what he said. ^^ even if it wasn't designed to test for afk cloakies, that's how it would be used.also, i don't want other players to know whether or not i'm at my computer. sometimes i just don't want to talk to people and i don't want to have to explain why i'm ignoring them as opposed to being afk."
8/6/2012,"oh ofc this is a manual setting not automatic, apologies if his wasnt clear, i will update original post."
8/6/2012,again apologies if not clear this was supposed to be totally a manual setting not some mechanic to detect if you are afk. basically i want an option that i can set manually to tell people i am afk. again this suggestion has nothing to do to detect afk cloakers.
8/6/2012,"my support on this one, i havent been in faction warfare for long but its clear to me that the element i actually signed up to fw for, is not there.on a side note, the whole way its evolved to an lp dump once every 2nd week i dunno how often, and rest of the time not giving a **** about the system makes it all pointless to me. i want to help conquer systems and hold them. but nobody cares about the systems when its not time for the dump."
8/6/2012,"so what is proper implementation? a test? in my mind i would say eventualy with players reading things like the csm minutes, someone would catch on to a poser. may be even the other csms would be able to spot them also especialy if there are other people on the csm with similar specialties. this i think would then tie in to another topic they brought up. how do you then remove a member? or would this even qualify as having need to be removed?"

8/7/2012,"i understand where people are coming from on this, however i disagree with making boosters only work on grid. since the removal of ""unprobeablilty"", t3 boosters have become increasingly vulnerable to combat. they have very week tanks and arn't that hard to catch. i feel that most people are whining because they have been killed by someone with a booster, and thus try to use it as an excuse for being bad at pvp. if someone brings a boosted 100mn tengu into your system, undock a webbing loki; problem solved. in my opinion, having a booster in a pos gives the owning corp/alliance a ""homefield"" advantage to people trying to come into their system and blob them. if you fly smart, boosters are easily countered. people are just stupid and get easily butthurt about some guy killing their lolfit fleets."
8/7/2012,"100% agree with this. putting boosters on grid will dumb the game too much. off grid boodters should provide a bonus to the better prepared fleet. if you can't probe them down because you don't have a scout with skills then too bad, you deserve to be at a disadvantage for being unprepared."
8/7/2012,it won't at all.ccp please drop the sentry gun ideas you had expressed in the minutes. they are terrible.implement the op instead. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
8/7/2012,"i agree with this. its too difficult to find good fights in lowsec because everyone is ""afraid"" to loose their sec status or gcc."
8/7/2012,"i like the idea, but i'm afraid lowsec will need a lot more intention than that....for example:1) with otec/highsec mission lp etc. compared to lowsec isk income vs risk is very unbalanced in favor of risk... just no reason to go into lowsec. an proposal to fix that could include more research/manufacturing/exploration/mining options that would increase lowsec viability2) another idea could be pirate fw? have pirates/outlaws side up with one of the existing npc factions (guristas, angels, serpentis etc) for bonusses/stuff.just some idea's.. i like that the barrier needs to be lowered for lowsec, but the problem has grown bigger then merely sec status or the recent hassle over sentry guns."

8/7/2012,apparently not...
8/7/2012,"they already did. don't you pay attention? inferno increased the cost of war-deccing a corp to a way larger sum than 2 million isk. whether it's working or not is entirely up to you. if it's just one guy, just fight back."
8/7/2012,"ahem.one man should not be able to slow you down, and if you are ignoring wardecs because its a bunch of one man corps, then you and everyone in your corp is pretty brain damaged from shooting too many red crosses.its a community of people who are able to fly the best subcaps in eve at a high level of skill(sp that is). if you get wardecced, use the happy new ally system to bring more firepower from those legendary destroyers of sansha to bear on anyone who does. the new wardec system favors you to such an extreme already that you don't need any more help other than maybe a life coach."
8/7/2012,"my ideas (stand-alone or combined, whatever suits your fancy):- limit it to 100%. period. no buffer, no nothing .. the beauty of the system flip portion of fw is that all hull sizes are theoretically required so one cannot merely drop bs+ and be assured a flip. fw is all about the plex fights .. doesn't prevent people from slugging it out on the bunker but it should not be the only option.- add some way for an attacker to determine which plexes can spawn post-vulnerable state. could be three external modules on bunker itself, one for each size plex .. when vulnerable two can be disabled by brute force or hacking. disable one and it accelerates the spawn frequency of the remaining two sizes, disable two and the remaining size plex has triple spawn frequency.- adopt pay out system from incursions .. any lp gained during siege is paid out when job is done not before. if people want lp here and now they can bloody well do missions.- add high tracking, destructible sentries to all plexes. balance their ehp/dps to encourage bringing the right ship/tool for the plex and purge the gunless frigs people so enjoy chasing.- defensive timer count downwards (resets) automatically with no enemy near, to actually capture plex a defender still needs to be present .. 25% of plex lp is added to upgrade pool provided there is some 'missing' (ie. has been taken out by hostile plexing).- adopt constellation-wide conflict system from incursions and have it offer meaningful stuff not available elsewhere (ie. systems still have individual upgrade trees). keep wzc mechanic as system upgrade cost modifier only, circumvents the rather large imbalance caused by geography, especially on the matar/amarr front** ... ever tried plexing in earnest behind dal choke point? meaningful stuff could be: -- availability of lp store items, with list only being fully populated if all systems in constellation are fully upgraded. removes the ability to go on shopping sprees right there in the trench under siege and adds some logistics to the mix as one must presume most front line constellations will be lacking an upgrade level or two.-- increased lp payouts from killing the enemy in constellation the more fortified (upgraded) it is.-- increased effect of defensive plexing (more vp, not lp) in constellation the more fortified (upgraded) it is.-- increased npc spawns in plexes in constellation the more fortified (upgraded) it is.-- increased lp from offensive plexing in constellation the more fortified (upgraded) it is .. a carrot has two ends and one is pointy!-- add you own ...unfortunately i doubt you'll get more than the first entry (bug squash) as the power that be are apparently quite happy with fw as is. so much promise, endless possibilities .. *cry* ** geography issue: try to count the maximum number of jumps needed to reach the 'deepest' system on either side of the kourmonen/auga and ezzara/vard gateways .. now check how many choke-points are in either direction as well as high-sec adjacent's (and what empire holds said adjacent's).the gallente/caldari spat was kicked off with the introduction of an entire region (black rise) designed specifically for the purpose as caldari had no low-sec to speak of .. devs made do with existing space for the matar/amarr theatre as both had plenty of low-sec.anyhoo, toodles .. back to setting up my overview. new pc \o/"
8/7/2012,make your proposal clear that you just want the lp to end at vulnerable and a cap to the amount it can be contested and i will support it. i think allot of fw players will support it. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
8/7/2012,"we can look at the entire starmap and just the solar system map, how about a map that only shows the systems in the region you're in?"
8/7/2012,"currently, all races have their unique ammo types. government-issued versions of those ammo types are superior, and prized in pvp.however, hybrid ammo is issued by both gallente and the caldari, and there's no difference in the two except the name. the markets generally favor the caldari navy ammunition with cheaper prices because there tends to be more caldari mission runners.proposal: grant each type of ammo a minor and unique bonus to differentiate the two.- federation navy ammo gets a minor (<= 5%) bonus on tracking.- caldari navy ammo gets a minor (<= 5%) bonus on optimal range.reasoning: a tracking bonus better suits the federation approach of close-up blaster brawls. optimal range bonuses support the caldari approach of ranged combat. variety is good."
8/7/2012,i like this.
8/7/2012,"over the years eve has become easier and easier . this is not a point of making the game harder but making it somewhat more interesting.this idea has be put forth here a few times, making all racial regions have contested space between them even amarr and caldari.sanashas nation can currently contest high sec.so why couldn't a few pirate nations live between empires in less secure space.the pirate factions all ready don't like the empire factions and a few of their opposing factions. for them to gain more power they was want more space. empire has it. (not inferring of removing current high sec systems. a region could be added as they did for fw.)this could also include some low end pirate missions within the systems. pirates would be primarily in space. (make use of em in space agents some more.) this would not only make you have the risk of travailing between systems for doing the missions but also landing on other people running missions turning in missions or people looking for a fight.this would allow more price fluxes between region to region in regarding prices due to the fact freighters can't go everywhere now unless they escorted by yourself or friends. so you would need scouts and someone to web to get into warp faster to make a safer route through low sec between regions.i am myself currently and have been mostly high sec my time in eve yet i would like to see these changes to make the game more interesting for myself and others."
8/7/2012,jump freighters would help there ... but your point still stands for the most part...i like it.
8/7/2012,yeah jfs would be a lot more common.more routes between the race's space would be nice so a pirate group cant camp a few systems to halt all movement between space.
8/7/2012,"prices are already skyrocketing to way above your proposed levels due to mineral costs. a carrier alone now costs around 1.4b. theres no need to make them more expensive then they already are. when you factor in the prices of capital mods/fighters, a fit carrier costs over 2b; thats a huge margin compared to the 250m it costs to fit a battleship."
8/7/2012,"should have been done years ago, were it to be changed now you'd essentially hand current capital owners a huge wad of cash as the market value spikes and unduly penalize all future prospective capital pilots.much more sense to limit what they can do and/or where they are of use. lots of talk about various cyno restrictions and similar ""soft"" changes that could potentially have a huge impact on how/when/where caps are used. probably easier (not as much forum rage) to change mechanics than ships at any rate, so there"

8/8/2012,"i think a lot of ideas from dotlan's site should be used in game. if you've never been there, it is great. its functionality puts the pretty eve in-game map to shame."
8/8/2012,"you could just sell it all. have a fire sale.most of the time the marker in nullsec is barren. you could easily set up contracts and sell orders, even after you've been kicked. in fact, it's actually rather profitable to fly out in a cloaky, start buying low and reselling high. the difficulty in logistics mean nullsec players get boned in market transactions.you could easily break even just selling your stuff and buying new things somewhere else.summary of eves last four expansions:"
8/8/2012,"i could be wrong on some points, but this is my understanding: there are only two ways you lose access to goods in a station: 1.) if you have items in a corp hangar, and the corp's office is ""unrented"", all corp hangar items goes into impound. once impounded, only directors can access it. to access it, the director must pay to release the items, and only has the option to do so when they have permission to rent an office. in short, if a station's controlling corp denies your corp rental privileges, you cannot access impounded items. however, since the owners can't actually ""unrent"" your office, you should always have a window to get your stuff out of corp hangar before you lose access to it. note: a director of your corp could ""unrent"" your office, thereby instantly creating inaccessible items, so chose our directors carefully!! 2.) the station controlling corp can deny docking rights to a station. this does not mean you lose your items. you can still remotely contract them and remotely sell them on the market. if you are in the station, you can also load up your valuables and try to sneak them out. yes, your access to the station is severely limited, as once you undock you cannot redock. note: if you have a lot of items in a station, it's always good to leave a jump clone there, as you can always jc back into station for one last load of items. as to the op. there are two ""1-click"" methods to lose your outpost items instantly: a.) you have a spy director that unrents your corp office in an outpost where you can't re-rent the times. b.) your docking rights to a station are revoked (like perhaps you get kicked from a corp, or unblued). is it really unreasonable that you lose access to your stuff? it sucks, but most of the time you have forewarning. with the exception of impounded items, you also have the ability to recuperate some of your losses (firesales, courier contracts, etc). losing assets drives wonderful evacuation events, and reclaiming inaccessible assets is a great driver for conflict (i.e. you're more likely to help shift the tides, and reclaim the station). i don't really see why this should go away. in my opinion, impounded items could use a re-work, but i don't see any reason to give access to regular player hangar items made inaccessible by an outpost's controlling corp. as for impounded items, i'd like them to become open to theft by the station's controlling corp, perhaps after some impound time period."
8/8/2012,"there already is a way: conquer the station. if your corp got kicked out of the alliance, join a hostile alliance and take it all back. even if it takes years, that's eve!"
8/8/2012,"i have encountered serious problems with the beacons that form the basis of warp-in points for missions and complexes.two examples that highlight some fundamental difficulties with them.scenario 1i am in a hurricane, hunting war targets in high-sec. using a neutral alt, i scout down a missioning tengu.i neatly put my alt 10km away from the stationary tengu, jump in with the hurricane, and click warp to 0 to my alt. i fly across the entirety of the system, giving ample warning to the target, who fails to warp off before i land. rather than land neatly on my alt at 0, i am dragged 70km away to a warp-in beacon, giving the tengu ample time to warp away.scenario 2i am hunting a target through a plex in 0.0, in my pilgrim, having played afk cloaky wossname for a week to give him time. i deftly maneuvre through dozens of large collidable objects, and his own wrecks, stopping 2200m off the acceleration gate towards him, so i can activate it without being decloaked, in the sure and certain knowledge he'll be spamming d-scan.i warp in without decloaking... until.. unavoidably, and arbitrarily, i am decloaked by the warp-in beacon i had no hope or ability to avoid. it's pot luck as to whether you land within 2000m or not, and are decloaked by it.proposal1) end the tyranny of the warp-in beacon in dragging you off your designated warp-in, where there is no acceleration gate to block your path. allow people to make use of decent scouting to get decent warp-ins on targets.2) stop beacons from arbitrarily decloaking covert ships. either terminate their decloaking properties, give players a chance to avoid them, or ensure that they always decloak you when you warp in. i favor the former."
8/8/2012,supported.
8/8/2012,"considering that beacons were added specifically to decloak ships entering through acceleration gates, i am not sure there is much merit in your proposal. put 70km range on your hurricane, or perhaps consider bumping the target with your alt to buy time to close range.you want free ganks handed to you on a platter? no thanks."
8/8/2012,"can you give me a link to evidence for your first assertion? if true, then it's been executed poorly, as its more or less random as to whether you are decloaked or not.secondly, it is hardly a free gank. there are two (possibly three) opportunities for the carebear to avoid losing their ship to a war target when missioning during war time - which frankly, they shouldn't be doing anyway.a) keep an eye out for combat scanner probes on d-scan, especially using d-scan range to identify when they are scanning you specifically.b) pay attention to local, and dock when a war target enters localc) use short-range d-scan to identify when something is about to warp in on you.incompetent carebears are incompetent."
8/8/2012,"hang on... put 70km range on a hurricane? how to tackle with hurricane at 70km?also, bumping would reveal the neutral alt or friend doing the scouting, rendering them useless as a 'neutral scout' for the rest of the war.kthxbai"
8/8/2012,"part of the mission is to force the player to cover a certain range that they can't avoid (do they still block a mwd?). it's like a physical obstacle meant to make the mission take longer. otherwise, the mission runner would do something like what you did. this also means that his hunter has the same problem.not all missions work this way. you'll just have to catch him on one of those. you also can wait for him to come back to the warp point. better yet, let him salvage through a few areas, wait for him at the warp in point of the last area, and surprise attack.this also is a good time to attack someone else from the war target corp. if he warps out to support them, you can be waiting for him when he warps back with his mission ship.this also is a case where long range can be useful. you need a (ab?) tackler and possibly a heavy tackler. then warp in with a long range bs. it takes a two man team (light tackler switches to a bs), but it could work. yes, 70k is a lot of ground to cover, but he can't get that far if you watched him leave his station and pursue soon after.my point is you can get to your target if you use tactics over game mechanics that are working as intended. if you want to hunt him in a mission, you have to deal with the mission too."
8/8/2012,anyone remotely competent (and paranoid/at war/in lowsec/etc.) jettisons a can or three as soon as they warp into a new mission area to decloak people. put it in the hands of the players.
8/8/2012,"everyone knows why would be disturb the afk tag some cloaky *snip*, who lying in the forum ""i'm afk at enemy systems and i cant kill anyone when i'm afk"", because they would be lost the chances to terrorizing active players in afk.it's time to create something what is should be change this bad game mechanic where a cloaker can hide in enemy system and can went out from his pc, 23 hours time long, without risk.risk free afk cloaking it's a bad game mechanic.the cloak not need cap or fuel usage, easy to going to work and left behind the cloaked ship at the enemy system in afk, because no one can scanning them, no one can catch them.need solution for handling this. capacitor useage for cloak, or fuel usage. counter ship (seek and destroy) or afk tag.edit: i have already had to edit previous posts of yours for this kind of language, please desist from this kind of behaviour in future and abide by the forum rules.slurs removed - isd type40."

8/8/2012,personally i would like to see a new destroyer class when they re-balance those to include a dedicated cloak hunting ship.with a special probe launcher and probes to be able to locate cloaked ships and an aoe weapon that would de-cloak them in say a 5km radius.this would however not be able to work on the cloak abilities that come from gate jumping.
8/8/2012,"you realise any idea that allows you to find or decloak cloaked ships is utterly awful, right? it would be catastrophic for wormhole space.and why do you need to find a cloaked ship anyway, they can't do anything."
8/8/2012,"+1supported.need counter against afk cloakers, 24/7 afk cloaking unacceptable and cap usage or cap fuel usage would be nice.somehow must fix cloak advantages when someone not playing, just break economics. that's same when someone dont go to work but want"
8/8/2012,"inherently flawed analogy, as there is no ""paycheck"" when afk. you cannot earn isk or perform/gain anything to your advantage while afk cloaked. afk cloakers also do not ""break economics"" - they are doing nothing. they can't make isk, they can't destroy isk, they cannot do anything."
8/8/2012,"afk cloaker break game economics, dont lie. easy and possible terrorize peoples without playing, because no counter against afk cloakers. ta-dam is right, when he said, that's same advantage if the pilot is not playing but get advance against other players without playing.the ratter cant go out to make isk, because that is very dangerous, when a cloaker in the system and noone know who afk, or not when no afk tag,no ship type detection and other thing forget your troll in this topic, you just spamming the topic with your trolling."
8/8/2012,"firstly, i do not appreciate the constant ad hominem. i am explaining the issues and my stance in a civil manner, repeatedly calling me a liar, screaming ""troll"" or flat out using bigoted attacks do not help your case. anyhow, i am not lying. afk cloakers do not, themselves, do anything to the economy at all. your claim that the ratters ""cant go out to make isk"" is incorrect. there is nothing stopping them from going out and making isk, they are perfectly capable of ratting and mining and whatever else-ing all day long. however, they chose not to. that's fine, that is their prerogative, but to blame other players - players who aren't even actually playing, as they are afk! - for the actions of others is dishonest and cowardly."
8/8/2012,"please ban ""thegunslinger42"" from this topic. he just ruin all forum topics with his continous trolling and personal attacks, without constructive answers."
8/8/2012,not the local is the real problem. the bad cloak mechanics is the problem if ship can cloak 24/7 hours long.
8/8/2012,"it may be worth pointing out that a cloaky pilot in any null sec system is of less risk than any cloaky pilot in any inhabited wormhole system. why?in the wormhole system you cant see there is a red/neut in system, so you don't have the information to avoid the risk - so what you do instead is have friends online to deal with it for you. these friends are called cloaked falcons, or rapiers or any other combat ship under the stars.want to be able to mine solo, without friends? then go to hi-sec, buy the new procurer and afk mine your life away.afk cloakers annoy me too, but you have to understand the way to deal with them is not to remove them from the game, it is to develop a viable defence strategy to neutralise them. this strategy is a combination of perma-bubbles, active gate camps, scouts and beefing up the toons guarding you in the belts.recently a dev blog stated that the recent changes were to allow miners to make meaningful choices before undocking. in null sec these choices have been around for ages."
8/8/2012,"i do nothing but provide valuable insight and constructive criticism. we wormhole dwellers have adapted and found ways to deal with cloaky enemies, after all - and it is a far harder task for us, as we do not have powerful intel tools such as local. you are free to disagree with me, but attempting to censor me and using multiple npc corp alts to yell ""troll"" is far more in the realm of ruining discourse by spewing personal attacks, trolling and an overall lack of meaningful or constructive contributions"
8/8/2012,u need to adapt to afk cloaking because it is broke. and if something is broke it needs to eb fixed. any advantage u can get by not being at your pc should be addressed. and i mean being 24/7 afk not on your comp and shutting whole systems sucks hard.
8/8/2012,"what advantage do you get while afk cloaked? do you get isk? do you get kills? do you do anything? the answer of course is no. afk cloakers do not, in fact can not, shut down a system. the residents of that system shut it down themselves. again do not blame the afk player for someone elses (the miners/ratters/etc) actions."
8/8/2012,"yes, you see the problems and i know balex players is experienced players like djukas,kreso cakija or babaroga too.afk cloakers get advantages to terrorize active players and break economics without play. advantages without play it's unfair against active players."
8/8/2012,"honestly coming from both cloaky camping and being cloaky camped, the simple was to stop a cloaky camper is teamwork. rat in fleets, or better yet, rat somewhere else. if someone is cloaky camping you and is in cyno range then you can obviously return the favor or use it to your advantage to set a trap. there isn't anything wrong with cloaky camping. either get some friends or move your precious ratting ship a system over."
8/8/2012,"it's simple not truth.easy to make for the big alliances with 8k players some cloaker alts and infect enemy system with afk cloaker alts. where could go a npc ratter when all their system infected with afk cloaker alts ? god bless us when the goons will starting this tactics and ruin all enemy system.impossible defend all systems in same time and sometimes the activity is too low to risk ratting. and your idea is stupid what you told, to move other place, when the ratting systems in 0.0 need permits and sometimes a renter just have few system. and why give advantages for afk players against the active players, why the active players need to move out against afk players ? the game mechanic is broken, more and more systems infected by afk cloakers, who not doing anything else (dont collect intel) just trying to make economic damage with inactive playing."
8/8/2012,"i agree that afk cloakers' reign of terror needs to come to an end.to accomplish this, i fully support removing local from lowsec and null so that you will be ignorant of his presence and carry on your activities as normal.any other solutions are not supported.good day."
8/8/2012,go to wh if you dont need local.remove local give more huge advantages to cloakers. that not supported.even the afk tag is better than remove local.
8/8/2012,"1.) if the afk tag was applied to everyone, not just cloakers, i might consider this. however, imo, this is taking intel in the wrong direction. we don't need more instant intel on people, we need less.....i personally want local set to wh delayed mode, and for ccp to actually create an intel tool / system. have it quickly alert you to the presence of a new pilot in space, but hide their identity & ship type until they are within recon range (i.e. you don't instantly know if the new local is friend or foe, but you moreless instantly know there is a new person in local). the recon range of ships could depend on your ship type/attributes, their ship type/attributes, skills, modules, and of course, the distance between you two. finally, have intel automatically shared with fleet members in system. this is much better than giving away even more free intel.... which we already have wwwaaaaayyyy to much of as is. 2.) any cloaky hunting mechanics should not hinder cloakers safely traveling through a gate camp, or you essentially nerf the primary function of a covert cloak into uselessness."
8/8/2012,this is the main problem with this cloaking system.
8/8/2012,"so when i am ratting trying to grind isk to fund my pvp habit every time a new local enters system i need to dock up and go grab a pvp ship to try and find out who they even are, while at the same time they warp off & cloak and now i have no idea what they are in.until ccp makes ratting in groups more profitable in 0.0 it wont happen. people are too concerned with their isk/hr ratios.now if there is an option for a system upgrade to be able to provide direct intel on someone jumping in i may be more for that. i dislike the afk cloak type but as others have said either move on to a different system or find something else to do until they get bored. so in short i am saying no to your proposal."
8/8/2012,"you act like goons don't already use this tactic. at some point or another you eventually get to the point where you either grow some balls and rat or tell ccp to completely remove cloaking. because removing cloaking is totally viable due to npc ratters not making the most of their situation, which is more than likely a nomadic lifestyle anyways. the other option for renters is to pack their bags and rent from somewhere else or simply rat in groups like i said earlier. i here test has some yummy space they're selling out."
8/8/2012,the advantage u get is distrupting others game by not being on your computer. the residents in the system can never know if the cloaky is afk or not. and any even a bit smart guy want go ratting when he knows there is a possible hot drop. so when one alliance deployes to attack another. the attackers shut every single system with afk ppl. that is a pretty big advantage for someone not being on his comp.
8/8/2012,"i agree with op.too much of a good thing is bad. cloaky 24/7 is bad, but make them de-cloak occasionally to enjoy some ""risk"" by either adding a timer or some energy mod that will time down by using up cap or something after a few hours.there are many ways to make the module stop working after a few hours. these annoying cloaky ships need to be regulated a bit for game balance.they can decloak and kil you solo ... or, they can scout you down and call their friends to kill you.and, that's absolutely fine. but, ... cloaking becomes abusive if they sit there 24/7, because you can't even scan them down to kill them back.please pick this up, dear c s m .... this cry for ""balance"" deserves some loving attention!"
8/8/2012,"the problem i see with afk cloackers:they are a potential threat. they could have a cyno and just wait for you to let your guard down. you dont know what they are doing, they may be afk on a safe, but they may also actively spy.putting an afk cloacker into every enemy system threatening that system with a instant titan bridge or captital hot drop makes counter strategies hard to plan, you can not defend all systems with full force.for the wormholers:you can not threaten a wh system with hotdrops, thats a big difference. the potential force projection of a cloacky inside a wh is much less significant.a potential solution:change cloaking devices to not completely hide the ship. just blurr the scannable signature.if it is on grid, it remains invisible as it is now.if you attempt to scan it down, instead of pinpointing the exact location, you get an area where the cloacky is hiding.you can warp to that area and sweep it (try to uncloack the ship). maybe this could be a special role (increase the decloack radius of a ship)for active cloackers that changes nothing, they can just warp away if they see people warping to the area. afk clocking on the other hand leaves you vounerable if someone takes the effort to sweep the area for you, as it gives the search party plenty of time to find you.afk cloaking in a fast moving ship still allows to find you, as consecutive scans will reveal the movement vector of your ship (the area moves) and your speed. it is much harder though.scanning the system for the cloacker can at least give you intel on where he is spying, allowing to determine if a cloacker is active or afk.to allow strategic use of cyno cloakers, if they are active, i would suggest to implement a 5 min timer after a warp where you are unscannable.the lore:cloaking ships can not circumvent the laws of physics, especially thermodynamics. a ship can only be completely hidden by storing the heat of their reactor inside the ship. while warping, you can vent the heat over a large area, making it impossible to scan it down. after you land, the time you can remain invisible by only using internal cooling systems and heat storage is limited, after that, you have to vent the heat to the space around you. a cloaking device can blurr the exact source of the heat and therefore your exact location, but not that there is a heat source in the area.i think that solution is more elegant than fuel or cap usage, as it really adds a need for constant movement and action for the cloacky pilot. that creates the feeling of actually doing something dangerous by spying in enemy space."
8/8/2012,"lets go over the commonly proposed ideas for ""fixing"" afk cloaking, and why they are (mostly) bad ideas.1) cap usage for cloaks: would make legitimate uses for cloaking a living nightmare. especially scouts in cov ops. there is no way to make this so that it would hinder afk cloakers without wreaking active cloakers.2) fuel usage for cloaks: would make usage of cloaks in hostile territory a mess. on my last null roam i spent about 12 hours cloaked, with only 1 station available to me for about 20 seconds (as long as it took to get out of the system). any mechanic of this sort to hinder afk cloakers woudl only hurt active cloakers more.3) remove local: this won't fix the ""problem"". won't really hurt cloakers that much by itself. would make the ones who find issue with afk cloaking even more mad though.4) anti-cloak/cloak detecting sov item: would make active cloaking near useless in sov systems. removes a large portion of gameplay.5) new ship to find cloakers: this would be a mess for active cloakers, and would require ccp to devote dev resources to making and balancing such a ship. not the worst idea though.6) afk tag: this is not a bad idea for the most part. only issue i see with it is that bots will become more viable in null if this was implemented. i am hesitantly in support of something along these lines, but for completely different reasons.there are probably more potential ""fixes"" that only make things worse, but i can't think of any.my opinion: this is only an issue because people can't play when they might be at risk. that is a personal issue. spend time in whs for a few months and you learn to not care if someone is in local (aside from the freakout when you enter a system and a bunch of stuff shows up on dscan...).edit: the guy above me posted a very nice idea... especially being able to vent the heat while warping. this would allow a covops to run a while without worry, venting every time they warp.no matter my personal view on the subject, i like that idea just from an immersion standpoint."
8/8/2012,a lot more profit could be made and some loss. i like the idea.
8/8/2012,"this.op, i am with you in spirit, but your proposed changes are no good. this would just increase the barrier to entry as well as inflation."
8/8/2012,"caps already have reduce insurance payouts (to make killing them feel more worthwhile) over other t1 hulls. also their modules cost more. also i can probably solo the ops battleship with a frigate, so obviously frigates need to cost 200 million isk now."
8/8/2012,"i don't agree with this either, the price of caps has doubled over the last 6 months or so due to the mineral cost rise and they are still flowing out the production lines."
8/8/2012,"i made a mistake in my last post. i meant to say that two ships that make an even match for one would each individually cost much less total, simply because there are two of them.carriers aren't even made for tanking without triage. they only tank well with triage, and they damn well can tank 10 battleships when they're feeding between one single other carrier and aren't getting neuted. compare that to 2 logistics cruisers repping each other against 10 frigates--the frigates will destroy them and won't need neuts to do it, but the 10 frigates cost much less than a logistics cruiser.argumentum ad populummy number of likes received is only partially proportional to how much people like my ideas, it also has a lot to do with how often i visit the forums. the number of likes i have will never go away, and if i make a post one day about dressing corpses and i get several hundred likes from it, it won't increase my ability to make useful commentary on ships. but i shouldn't even have to explain this to you.shah fluffers wrote:cost of production is almost never a limiting factor. supercarrier and titan proliferation proved this all too well.what will happen is that you raise the bar for a small entity to get a carrier or dreadnought while doing nothing to curb their mass production by larger entities.your point is completely reasonable and definitely a major thing that will have to be considered when figuring out how to balance the resources. it is not impossible by any means, it simply hasn't been done right in the past. i don't know the exact solution to the problem (nobody does, without trying and finding out), but the best way to start would be to require capital ships cost materials that are limited in production by the number of players producing them--similar to pi. absolutely none of the necessary resources should be possible to control completely by one alliance or cartel. this way, any individual with enough net worth can cough up a capital ship.i think that some resources should be somewhat controllable, just to give something for big alliances to fight over. but there should always be some resource bleed into the main population so that the little people can get their hands on it. one method i thought of would be for moons to gradually deplete (over the course of months) and for other moons to sometimes grow into a new resource. this way, any alliance trying to control a resource (say technetium) would have to constantly keep an eye out for the new sources, and wrest control of the systems that have it. a small alliance could potentially find a technetium deposit on one of their moons and keep it a secret until they had stockpiled a good chunk.you're talking about a jump from battleship to capital ship, so no, it's not."
8/8/2012,this could work if the defensive lp was donated directly to the infrastructure hub instead of the defenders wallet.doing that would solve the problem of having alts in each militia plexing a system back and forth.

8/9/2012,"completely agree with the op. wh-space is defined by living in the most remote, challenging, unforgiving places, while getting great rewards on being an adventurer, and truly being alone in space, depending completely on yourself."
8/9/2012,"by ""better prepared"" you mean people should have a ""scanning alt"" to find the ""boosting alts."" alts-online. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
8/9/2012,"more money for ccp that way, why would they want to change it?"
8/9/2012,"it may seem like a good idea to basically require everyone to have alts logged in to pvp. but i think this just turns people off from the game. not to mention how eve will be a nonstarter for new players, if it continues to foster a reputation that you need to play several alts to be competitive. alt scouts, alt boosters etc. i think the alt haulers are ok because they can be one of your 3 characters on the same account. but for things like boosters and scanning alts you need to buy multiple accounts. this emphasis has to be hurting the game. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
8/9/2012,"hey vagabondsa number of you are missing the so called frills we had removed from the vagabond during the v3 process, and i think it<U+FFFD>s totally fair that i (the art director) give you an explanation why we did that, and what our intentions (visually) are with the vagabond in the future. eve is constantly under development and we in the art team look at the renovation process as an ongoing never-ending task that we love to keep working on alongside the new assets we make every year. some players don<U+FFFD>t like to see to many changes made to their beloved ships, but because of this, the fidelity of the game after all these years is still hard to beat and eve keeps getting great reviews for the art every year. however maybe the decision to remove the frill from the vagabond was taken too lightly and i didn<U+FFFD>t realize how attached to the look of the ship you were. to me, as the art director the vagabond is a thukker version of the stabber, but with brutor sails attached (rather badly, with intersecting polygons) to the bridge area that make the ship look a bit silly. but after giving it some thought i can understand the iconic appeal. i think you should get your frills back in some way or the other.that being said, i always wanted to fix the old stabber up a little bit and give it some more love. i<U+FFFD>m not talking about a huge overall change to the ship. but rather just balancing a bit the engine area and making some parts a little more believable. this would of course give us a chance to give the vagabond some extra care and design the frills with thukker and some functionality in mind. i already have stephan st<U+FFFD>lting an amazing concept artist working on it and i promise to keep you posted about the development in the near future. until we finish it you still have to live with a <U+FFFD>no frills<U+FFFD> vagabond.regards ccp huskarl"
8/9/2012,thank you thank you thank you!!!!
8/9/2012,always nice to see ccp reacting to user feedback and already looking forward to brighter amarr ships.
8/9/2012,"thank you, i missed not seeing the space dragon."
8/9/2012,"thank you!! i look forward to new and improved stabber class ships with some form and return to the iconic and traditional ""frills"" associated with the demon vagabond.thanks for hearing us. it means a lot."

8/9/2012,"great news. i'm glad we were heard. it's been a fun tubthump and a great excuse for some community content. next update, how about removing engine trails for a laugh? i'm sure that'd get an enthusiastic response and we could organise a week-long sit-in (somewhere that serves beer). ;)#notrailisfail?"
8/9/2012,woot !! \o/ tbh i'm just elated over the fact that there was a thought about this and a response by devs/ccp. the fact that it is being reviewed and possibly brought back in some iteration is just icing on the cake.
8/9/2012,and there was much rejoicing! i am excited to see what you have in store!

8/9/2012,"aaah but that would then require them to spend isk, thus ruining their isk effeciency.its just easier for them to demand a change to help them :p"
8/9/2012,"op updated. the jotunn risi are now recruiting, brutor ancestry required in order to best represent the brutor interest. join channel joris to learn more!"
8/9/2012,"i support this proposal. proactively defending a system is already extremely difficult if no one lives there, and the current mechanics just exacerbate the futile nature of defending non-staging systems."
8/9/2012,nail on the head
8/9/2012,"i don't like how people assume its easy to cloak hunt in null sec.when you hunt you have 2 choices. you can lurk a sport someone will come and investigate which means you'll either a get tagged as afk by these changes or target won't rat, mine, plex what have you.second you can roam solo going from system to system. given the fact that anyone in system sees you enter they dock up or watch to see if you keep going on your merry way assuming your passing through. if you spend any time beyond what it takes to get to the next gate guess what? they dock up.any changes to the system would render cloaking less useful unless they changed the basic rules of cloaking.target timer penalty, warping with less then covert ops impossible and speed penalty.you can't reasonable change one aspect of the game without considering what you do to the others."
8/9/2012,"yes, this is the pure truth.just as i said earlier, god bless us if a big alliance will starting this tactic and infect all solar systems.thats would be ruin the whole game and will bring huge economic catastrophe to players.a smart pilot knows, when a cloaker in the system, the threat is critical when he trying to move to ratting and he dont know the cloaker afk or not. and dont forget sometimes the residents dont have enough active players in system to defending.so, the pilots have two choices, he moving out from infected system if he want to evade from danger zone or he risk what is not wise choice.but too easily infect all systems with cloaker alts and the pilot not have any chance to move other ""cloaker free"" system.the other problem is, if the residents move from underpopulated places to densely peopled system, the other systems will be uninhabited and generate lag at the main hubs and dont forget the ratting place numbers is not limitless.the real problem is, the inactive players can cloaking 24/7 times long without playing. this would need to change. the other problem is the threat possibility from inactive players against active players, what is huge advantage for inactive player and unfair game mechanics against active players.as the mining bots, which get advantage without playing."
8/9/2012,"pro-tip: if you want the rewards of ratting/plexing in nullsec you must deal with the risks. if you are unwilling to deal with the risk, or to put in the effort to counter it, then you're free to head straight back to hisec.cloaking is fine as is. stop being babies."
8/9/2012,"i stopped reading when you said cloakies in wormholes are less of a threat. you have no idea what you're talking about, cloakies are far more of a threat in wormholes because you don't even know they're there at all - at least in nullsec you have local and know how many people are in system with you. twenty t3s can't decloak on you from nowhere."
8/9/2012,nice and interesting ideas but not real solution against cheater script users.too easy to write a script which is warping between safespots. better if a cloak need fuel usage because the pilot must recharge his fuel and script unusable in that situation.
8/9/2012,"op... you're not fooling anyone with your alts in their newly made 1 man corps. you're basically copy-pasting the same statements in the exact same bad english.with that pointed out...using that reasoning we should also nerf traders and manufacturers. i mean... all they do is move some numbers here and there... maybe ship some stuff this way and that way... in fact... most of their money earning happens when they are not actually logged in... much less undocked and shootable by their enemies.there are an innumberable amount of counters for dealing with hostile cloakies. here... i'll repost them from another thread for easy reading!- have everyone who wants to rat in the same fleet so you can all warp to each other if problems occur (yes, effort).- have one or two people in taranii flying around system as a ""rapid response team"" (stealth bombers hate small, fast, high-dps ships).- don't min/max your fits for ratting... pvp fit them (i.e. omni-resists, warp disruptor, warrior ii drones, heavy energy neutralizer) so you can give your interceptor buddies time to get to you (yes, this will cut into your isk-efficiency... boo hoo).- alternatively, have someone with you in a plex/sanctum/anomaly in a super-sebo'd arty-fit muninn/tornado/maelstorm. not only can they assist you and help you clear things up faster, but they are very menacing to slow, tankless stealth bombers.- falcons, rooks, and kitsunes can jam hostiles from long range so miners can warp away.- logistics ships. use them for their intended role: keeping people who don't want to die, alive.- change up your ratting tactics. use range and/or speed rather than plain ""gank and tank."" stealth bombers can't move all that fast when cloaked.- if you are really skittish... use a cheaper, more ""disposable"" ship. yes, that tengu will be able the clear out a plex in under an hour without breaking a sweat... but a t2-fit cerberus or raven is a fraction of that and takes... what? a 15% to 20% reduction in isk-efficiency? maybe a bit more effort too? that sounds fair for risking 80 to 90% less of your isk.- check the killboards of the guys cloaking in your system. you can guesstimate their ""active times"" by seeing when they get most of their kills.- if you are afraid of normal cynos, get a cyno jammer in your system. if you are afraid of covert cynos... use the above tactics. very few ships can use covert cynos (see below).an addendum: knowing the strengths and weaknesses of cloaking ships can help you immensely.- stealth bombers and covert-ops ships have [almost] no tank. any ship with the proper point defenses can breathe on them and they'll pop.- recons and t3s all have a targeting delay of about 5 to 7 seconds. including the time to actually achieve target lock, you have about 7 to 10 seconds to warp off. - recons and t3s all suffer from some problem. poor tank, poor dps, or poor speed. the only exception to this is the cloaky proteus. but a heavy neutralizer or two can easily neuter it.- t3s can't equip covert cynos.- black ops ships are exceedingly weak in extended combat due to their poor stats and cannot warp cloaked. but that's a side issue. if one lands on you then you are screwed as they almost never travel alone. to get killed by a black-ops ship means that you screwed up badly in some way or just got really unlucky. no. you should already be in a pvp-fit ship. with a buddy. who can instalock anyone who decloaks nearby and instapop them.and the simple fact that you know there is a potential hostile defeats the whole point of ""covert-ops"" don't you think?this is a ""person"" issue. not a game mechanics issue. if people are so greedy that they refuse to share isk with someone who can give their ship better odds of survival... then they deserve no safety at all. or isk.seriously? all you need is one person in the right ship to help you. is it really that hard to dredge up one person out of the hundreds, even thousands of others who might be in the same system... doing something similar? sorry... i find that very hard to believe.somewhere in your alliance chat is a gullible rookie you can con into watching your back for a paltry amount.look, lets cut the crap. an ""afk cloaker"" is one person... in one ship... in a system where a resident has many places to run and hide in... where said resident's corpmates and alliancemates also live in... with all their ships... and all their equipment... which has the capability to deal serious damage to another thousand man alliance... and has yet been ""shut down"" by one man?i don't even think i can begin to articulate how cowardly that sounds. a high-sec miner seems to have bigger gonads than the people who whine about ""afk cloakers."" how is that possible you ask? well... the miner does his trade in a system where local is filled with an innumerable amount of strangers and any one of them could be a potential ganker."
8/9/2012,"^ good postand you'd think ribikoka would be able to use one of the ten different alts he uses to back himself up in threads like this to perform one of the roles you suggested, wouldn't you?"
8/9/2012,"i'm laughing when i saw those answers.cloakers are alone ? who dreamed this silly answer ? "" stealth bombers and covert-ops ships have [almost] no tank."" rotflthey easily can use cyno/covert cyno generator. man they dont need tank enough for them a scrambler, dampener and a cyno and you die.rapid response team ? lol a ratter gonna die between 30-60 seconds no one will save them from adept pvpers. no one will to save them, the time period is too short and impossible to defend all systems. how many time you need to move one or two system range ?ratting with pvp ship is not help for anyone, because the rats will shot too and pilot get handicap, furthermore he will suffering income deficits too. (another economic damage suffering from inactive afk cloaker player)and you talking about 0.0, maybe you are a pro player and you can build cynojammer in low sec. your buddy ""facepalm"" answer was the biggest ridiculous answer. maybe you never heard about timezones, when just few players online and players dont have active buddies. what they do ? log off because some afk cloaker in his system got advance against active players ?and why use cheaper ships reasons of inactive players ? that's not op for an inactive player ?inactive players why affect playstyle for active players ? that's the dumbest thing in this game."
8/9/2012,"everyone is dealing with risks in 0.0 to make some profit. i ninja ratted (gangs running around, solo pvpers trying to catch juicy ratters) for months on war fronts. but i dont want to adapt to broken mechanics really sucks. as ccp is banning bots that gets u advantages and breaks the game experience for other miners they should tweak the cloaking systems which now get advantages to alliances, hot dropers, mercenaries (they actually get paid to put a net of afk cloakers in attacked regions) and break the game experiences of other ppl by simply not being on comp."
8/9/2012,"that is one of the risks of living in nullsec. if you can't deal with these risks, why should you get the reward? go back to hisec.what is ""lol"" about having friends who can respond to a hostile ship (or group that cynos in) and shoot back? it may seem like a foreign concept to a carebear like yourself, but fighting off enemies - rather than demanding ccp remove them from the game - is kind of what eve is about.as for using the pvp ship/fitting... you state you will not do it because it'll damage your bloody isk per hour ratio? well then you have zero right to complain - you're aware of what you're doing (sacrificing survivability for a slight boost in profit) and willingly made that choice. you can't make those decisions and then pretend you're a victim and ask ccp to change game mechanics because you flat out refuse to adapt or approach situations differently, that's just stupid.inactive players cannot effect the playstyle of active players. they are inactive. they are not doing anything. if the active players do not want to risk it and make that choice, that is on their heads. they have no one to blame but themselves. as for timezone coverage... well recruit more people. if you have insufficient manpower for your endeavors or to defend yourself, that is a problem with your corporation/alliance, not with any game mechanic. recruit more players, make friends with neighbouring corporations/alliances, etc. don't scream to ccp to change the mechanics.to summarize, stop being a self-entitled coward. man up, adapt, prosper."
8/9/2012,"projecting much? ah... but they are alone... unless there is more than one. but that doesn't really change anything.oh dear... does it hurt when you narrow your eyes that much? you're looking at each piece of advice as if you can only do one at any given time. i assure you... it's more than possible to do many of those tactics at the same time.i'm a personal fan of the super-seboed arty ship helper and pvp-fit ratting ships. instapopping stuff never gets old. neither does surprising some ****** who thinks you are easy pickings. why would people whose job is to keep people safe be out so far away? they should be in the system where the threat is. or where the most people are.untouchable heart wrote:ratting with pvp ship is not help for anyone, because the rats will shot too and pilot get handicap, furthermore he will suffering income deficits too. (another economic damage suffering from inactive afk cloaker player)---boo hoo. if you want to farm in a min/maxed pve ship then accept that you're cannon fodder for any proper pvp ship.giving up isk efficiency for proper point defense is working as intended imo.and yes... not dying to rats in a pvp-fit ship requires that you revise how you shoot the rats (i.e. change of tactics). if you had actually read my earlier post, you would have seen that i mentioned this (ex. don't tank and gank... speed tank and snipe them!)untouchable heart wrote:and you talking about 0.0, maybe you are a pro player and you can build cynojammer in low sec. ---heh. no one is concerned about ""afk cloakers"" in low-sec. half of local is a potential threat at any given time (even if it's nothing but especially if it's corp/alliancemates in local). we're used to it.and when we run level 5s down there... we do everything i mentioned above (did i mention that i like super-sebo tornados?) untouchable heart wrote:your buddy ""facepalm"" answer was the biggest ridiculous answer. maybe you never heard about timezones, when just few players online and players dont have active buddies.---why are you in an alliance whose tz is different from yours? isn't that boring? what do you do when another alliance decides to roll in and take over?untouchable heart wrote:and why use cheaper ships reasons of inactive players ? that's not op for an inactive player ?---no. that's just common sense. flying a billion isk ""shiny"" with no back-up is a killmail waiting to happen.

8/9/2012,"i think, you see the problems.afk cloaking mechanics is broken. same when bots gets advantages without play."

8/9/2012,i find it strangly amusing all these cloaking ballance threads end up making 0.0 sec less dangerous than low sec.maybe the rewards should be adapted acordingly.none of these idea's will probably be adopted as long as people can dock up in station's in low sec and npc 0.0.i think people that are thinking cloaking needs to be reballanced (which i don't by the way) should take in mind that their idea's shouldn't make 0.0 less dangerous than low.
8/9/2012,"i have to agree.i feel safer in null sec because it comes with the mentality that it's big boy space. this causes people who go there to normally have a defined reason why they are there.this means the locals who own it and those who want something from the space.because of the low population of nullsec depending where you go people who are there are either blue or red. forget the ship they are in you have an idea right off the bat they could be out to get you.now take lowsec, many more unknowns. you have more people most of which can be neutral though some flagged as low security. those who have low sec status come in two stripes, those who pirate and those who proactively defend themselves when some comes out behind them or they attacked someone red to him.coupled with the higher population lowsec makes it so that guy who could be cloaked could be going after any body.so no unless you want to make it easier to find targets when you are hunting so they can't run in time making any change to ask cloak screws the whole lurking shark."
8/9/2012,"you talking about wrong things.the main problem is, the inactive afk player who not at his computer, could manipulate the active player's game.have nothing to do with, how dangerous low or null sec. this is a bad game mechanics. if something such the cloack give advantage to active players that's fine, but when something give advantage for inactive player against active players that's a fail."
8/9/2012,so what is your proposal for being afk in a station?
8/9/2012,that's dangerous for anyone ? that's make economic damage for active players ?
8/9/2012,"wrong wrong incorrect and wrong. the inactive player cannot manipulate another player in any way what-so-ever. cowardly crybabies make their own decisions and do things to themselves, then try to shift the blame onto others. it is extremely dishonest. like punching yourself in the eye then running to the police and crying that someone who wasn't even there beat you up."
8/9/2012,"you trolling and insulting others again and again. inactive player can manipulate active player's game.""the advantage u get is distrupting others game by not being on your computer. the residents in the system can never know if the cloaky is afk or not. and any even a bit smart guy want go ratting when he knows there is a possible hot drop.so when one alliance deployes to attack another. the attackers shut every single system with afk ppl. that is a pretty big advantage for someone not being on his comp.""by zloco crendravenbalkan express"
8/9/2012,"alright lets get one thing straight. an inactive player cannot manipulate anyone's game. they are inactive.the person manipulating their game is the one who hides from the potentially inactive player. it is a self defeating choice, but it is still a choice. they do not, and cannot, force you to lose money. if they are not at the computer, they can't do anything.also, fluffy and gunslinger are not alts of each other. their posting history would make that clear.just because more than one person disagrees with you does not make them alts."
8/9/2012,"again you wrong and dont telling truth, gunslinger alt.an inactive player can manipulate active player's game. the active players dont know he afk or not, and wont go out to ratting when the potential danger is too high, they wont go out to ratting and theyl lost isk. this is why afk cloaker in enemy system get advantage without playing against active players.everyone know this, who say anything else dont telling truth and just evade and just want to save their advantages from a wrong game mechanics."
8/9/2012,"oh for gods sake.an afk player is not manipulating the game. the player who hides is.i'll admit, there is no way to know if the cloaker is afk. but, if he is, he cannot change anything. the only change is because people like you make a change. you manipulate your game.if a person is doing nothing, they cannot be doing something. its basic logic.and i'm not guns alt. stop using that stupid excuse for why people disagree with you."
8/9/2012,"oh my god. i think you knows nothing about how can terrorize peoples with inactive cloaker alts.if you don't want a sarcastic answer, then don't tell stupid answers.the cloaked terror is known tactics in eve online."
8/9/2012,"this thread appears to be on a slippery slope. good discussions benefit everyone, personal insults kill those discussions. i will leave this thread open for now, but if people cannot refrain from personal attacks then i will lock it.remember, not everyone will have the same opinion as you, this does not mean that they are wrong and deserving of derision and insults, it is our differences that stop things from getting stagnant. so please, be respectful of one another, and lets try and have a frank exchange of ideas, thank you - isd type40.[b]isd type40 lt. commander community communication liaisons (ccls) interstellar services department[/b]"

8/9/2012,"ribikoka, if a ratter makes assumptions about another players activity or intentions and chooses to do (or not do) something based on those assumptions, that is nothing to do with said player. that player is not ""manipulating"" anyone as they are literally doing nothing. you cannot place blame on someone else because you made assumptions about them and then chose to act on those assumptions. further still, even if those players were manipulating, meta-gaming, employing scare-tactics or whatever else you wish to claim (which they are not, they cannot, as they are not active)... well, welcome to eve. that is exactly what sets eve apart from other mmos and is key to its success. if you don't like that, or can't work with those mechanics, you're playing the wrong game. if you wish to take a break and try other mmos you may send your isk and belongings to me and i will keep them safe until you return."
8/9/2012,"you still not understand the truth and just talking nonsense things.the inactive cloaker who can terrorize active players with his scare-tactics, get advantage against active players.easy to understand this, who want to hear the others answers. many players dont aggree with you in this topic, no matter how you trying with your alts. thats not change the real things. the afk cloaker get advance and can terrorize active players and can damage economics without playing. that is a bad game mechanics."
8/9/2012,and? hypothetically i can send a mail using eve gate to an industry corp telling them to pay me or be wardecced. is it the fault of the mechanics or the industry players themselves if they all jump corp to avoid the mere threat of being wardecced... even though i never logged into the game?? i beg to differ.
8/9/2012,"the other afk topics show to us something wrong with afk cloaking if so many players want to change.this is not surprising and it cannot be a coincidence when the afk cloaking mechanics is broken and unfair.and please forget those silly answers from trader and manufacturers.those players not dangerous to any players. they are not risk active player's game, when they inactive and they are not possible threats."
8/9/2012,"the idea i posted of course needs some balancing. i thought about the completely invisible timer after warp to help active cloacky scouts. they should not suffer too badly from the proposed mechanic that allows to scan the area of a cloacker.of course, this can be abused by scripts (aka bots), but that is against the eula and will hopefully get those people banned. to propose a valid mechanic, i just have to assume that everyone is playing by the rules (not botting). and you dont need a clocker to be invoulnerable by using such a script, it works with every ship that has a reasonable align time. warp around per script between a handful of good (unaligned) safespots, and noone will scan you down in time. the script could even create new safes in the process, if you really want to get down that road. if you care about cheaters, you will never find a viable solution. thats the job of ccp.having a ship with an increased radius where it decloacks ships is the only chance to make the mechanic work as intended, even if you know the area where the cloacker is (50km radius for example), it is very hard to sweep that space with the current radius you need to get in. just think of how many people you need to fly in formation to form a net that can effectively sweep a chunk of space. especially if the target is moving and you only have a rough vector for his movement.this could be a role for a frigate or destroyer hull, a small fast ship that isnt very useful for other things. this can be balanced to make fleet commanders think twice if they want to bring 20 of them for a roam just in case they see someone cloacking. the ship has to be made for that purpose, then it will be mainly used for search parties in own systems and not everywhere. a cheap hull can do this. jump in, do the sweep, kill the afk cloacker, get another ship for your next roam.the possibility to scan down the area where a cloacker is hiding is limited, you need a ship with scanner probes for that, and not every roaming fleet brings probers. so for the most part, nothing changes. but for defending a system, probing and sweeping ships can be combined to make the life for a cloacker harder and kill off all the afk cloackers."
8/9/2012,"the idea of a ship that can scan out cloaky ships is abysmal. it entirely destroys the roles of cloaking ships and completely trashes wormhole space. and ccp will thankfully never implement it, they are not that crazy/stupid"
8/9/2012,"your idea is not bad, but better if you dont give to chance for botters. no chance to scripting = no cheats and don't need to resolve this problem."
8/9/2012,"ok, then scratch the part with the 5 min timer. a cloacker that sees probes on dscan simply has to assume that somone will show up in the area. so he either has to warp away, or just watch what they try to do and avoid the sweep.it will still allow cloacky fleets to set a trap, but they have to keep in mind that there is a potential counter: the area where they set the trap could be exposed by a prober, and the allys of that prober could try to decloack the ships."
8/9/2012,"you didnt read my first post, did you?i am not speaking of a ship that can scan down probers and pinpoint their location, i am proposing a general mechanic that lets you probe down the area where a cloacky is.its not meant to give you a warpin on top of him, you will land like 20-50k off him, not knowing the exact location. just that he is roughly in that area. you then have to sweep the whole space to find him, and if he is active, he will see what you are doing and either move around the sweeping ships or warp away."
8/9/2012,"your idea would need more thought on specifics (especially with how eager eve players are for finding loopholes), but as a basic, it isn't bad.not as bad as cap usage or fuel. then again, neither is cancer (for those who do not speak english as a first language, that was a joke using hyperbole).anyway.ribi, why do you think me, fluffy, gunslinger (pretty much anyone who disagrees with you) is an alt of the other?people are allowed to have the same opinion as another. i don't go around accusing you and everyone else in this thread with poor english who think this is a problem as being alts.also, we have been (mostly) constructive in our responses. gunslinger less so...also, to the person who suggested i don't know about danger: two years in whs, low sec, and npc null (last few months in hs because i haven't had much time to play). i don't stop when someone i don't know is in the system. i keep doing what i was doing, with a few extra precautions. only a few times have i regretted not docking up. and i can say without a doubt that i did not let anyone who was not at their computer affect my income.afk cloakers only effect your income because you let them. its like throwing your money out the window and complaining when folks pick it up off the ground.is afk cloaking a dirty tactic: yes, so is most of them in eve.is afk cloaking effective: yes.does the afk cloaker do anything aside from sit in space: nope. you do it. you are giving the afk cloaker what they want (or don't want... they may not care). you are responsible for any loss in income."

8/10/2012,"oh, i think i love you!"
8/10/2012,"i have no confidence in the csm, does that count?"
8/10/2012,"thank you much! we are thukking thrilled at this new development :) keep up the good work, and thanks for listening!"
8/10/2012,well soon you can be thukking frilled ;)
8/10/2012,rawr! ty! +1
8/10/2012,agreed with implanting a name change. just posted something about this not thinking of looking for something already posted
8/10/2012,"title says it all. it was removed way back when they upgraded the sound system. i want it back exactly as it was. it was corny and completely out of place in a space game, which is why it was so great."
8/10/2012,"the system is clearly broken.amarr faction have taken to fitting ""pimp"" no combat ships to farm plexes long after it ceases to be a good use of matari subscription fees to try and chase them while they boast about their wcs in local.lp should stop at 100%.something needs to happen with npcs to stop the behaviours below=========[merlin, sad strange little man's merlin]warp core stabilizer inanofiber internal structure iipower diagnostic system iismall shield booster ii1mn afterburner iiexplosive deflection field iikinetic deflection field iiprototype cloaking device ismall capacitor control circuit ismall capacitor control circuit ismall capacitor control circuit i[merlin, faction fit makes me 1337]damage control iioverdrive injector system iibeta reactor control: diagnostic system igistii b-type small shield boostercoreli c-type 1mn afterburnergist b-type explosive deflection fieldkinetic deflection field ii[empty high slot]small capacitor control circuit ismall capacitor control circuit ismall polycarbon engine housing i"
8/10/2012,"massively agree, something needs to be changed. i believe fw was brought about to encourage pvp, but all i'm seeing lately are t1 frigs soloing major plexes in already vulnerable systems.it's being abused, this should stop.-deuce"
8/10/2012,"just to summarize most urgent issues with current plex mechanics: it should be not possible to make a system vulnerable more than 100% to capture a plex as offender you should be forced to kill the rats. (e.g. by counter stopping counting down when npc are on grid, in such a case i would also recommend to make timer the same for all plexes to compensate for the time you need to kill the rats in large plexes) this would at least stop people taking large plexes with t1 frigates having no guns. there should be more large plexes in general and they should provide more points with regards to contestation / decontestation than small ones."
8/10/2012,i'm not sure about that last one. i think we already find that most of the actual pvp happens in the smaller plexes - mediums and minors. i don't think this is going to change with the changes you list. trying going into an offensive plex against the minmatar rats (not sure about other sites) and killing all the rats. i think you will see that you will be best served using a pve ship. once your sig radius goes up to the size of a bc or bs those rats do allot of damage. there will be very few fits that are even quasi pvp you can use. so i say leave it the same where large plexes do not give more toward contesting than smaller plexes. you already make more lp per minute in them. plus the tags are much more valuable. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
8/10/2012,"from latest patch notes""cloaked ships will no longer be uncloaked by invisible cosmic signature and cosmic anomaly beacons""i wonder if this applies to mission warp-in beacons in the same way? devs feel free to clarify please!"
8/10/2012,"no, that's wrong if you create an easily openable backdoor for cheaters and wait for ccp solution to solve this problem.the fuel usage for cloak more better solution. there impossible to cheat."
8/10/2012,"no, again, no. god sake man.afk cloakers do anything. they terrorize the peoples in system without activity and without play. no one knows who activ or not. so, critical risk for resident peoples to move ratting. this terror affect the active players game. this is a huge advantage for a non active players against active players and a bad game mechanics.that's why all afk cloaker crying when someone say give afk tag for afk cloakers, because they would lose this terror chance ability. everyone knows this, just who use this tactics trying to stricture this changes."
8/10/2012,"no, i'm against the afk tag because it it unnecessary and provides carebears (and bots) even more free intel and power. they should not have all this handed to them on a silver platter. if they are unwilling or unable to put in the time or effort required to prosper in 0.0/lowsec/wormholes that is their problem. i'm against other suggestions - such as ""cloak fuel"" or cloak-detecting-probes because they are quite frankly terrible ideas, and destroy several mechanics - and an entire region of space (wormholes). as for afk players ""terrorizing"" people: no. you are wrong. a player who is not playing the game cannot, by definition, do anything to anyone. nullbears terrorize themselves over this idiocy. wormhole dwellers seem to cope, and cloakies are much larger threat in wormholes."
8/10/2012,please stop posting.why are you so annoying? you just write nonsense for your dumb readers when in fact you are just fail and just don<U+FFFD>t know how to play.you are wrong and you are talking like a noob player.afk cloakers can terrorize residents.
8/10/2012,"calm down dear, i am at least attempting to have a somewhat constructive discussion, and to explain issues that would arise from some of the suggestions for ""fixing"" (not broken, none issue) 'afk cloakers' your post, however, was just a long string of ad hominem. it completely lacked any content what-so-ever.if you're going to make the claim that players who are literally incapable of doing anything are ""terrorizing"" or otherwise influencing other players (and why that shouldn't be allowed) you may want to provide some evidence or logical arguments. as for the carebears in null, i suggest they learn that they have more than one course of action upon seeing a singular extra name in local. they do not have to respond to that pilot by immediately docking/posing up and logging off - they can do that if they wish, but that is only one of many choices they have, and they have no right to complain or demand gameplay mechanic changes. another user better explained all the other choices available to residents, such as continuing to rat anyway, or altering your fit to a more pvp-like fit to increase your chance of survival, or having friends in combat or logistics ships to help, etc. there are a lot of things residents can do to deal with the single extra pilot in local (who may not even be at the computer). you have a lot of options, so there is no need to ""fix"" what isn't broken."
8/10/2012,"every expert knows afk cloaking its a tactics against habitants, when he write this is not true and afk cloakers dont do nothing, he just write silly things.forget his inconpetency. he is an obvious troll, who use afk cloak tactics and he dont want to lose this advantage and posting with his alts.we known active and passive terrors. such a bomb threat, no matter the bomb is existing or not exising.just a stupid man would go in a marketplace where is a bomb threat. cloaker in his solar system it's a same thing.a dangerous threat, because habitants dont knows the cloaker are active or not.that's why they can terrorize habitants there. that's why this mechanics is wrong, because they are not active and they can influence other active players.thats not unfair when a players went to work, but his character do nothing active job in system, as recon or intel job, but they can manipulate other active player's game ??that's unfair and a broken game mechanics."
8/10/2012,"an afk cloaker is not a threat, just like a logged off player is not a threat. the only way they could be a threat is if they are not afk, in which case deal with it. as for influencing other players: welcome to eve. other people exist in the sandbox. deal with it or leave."
8/10/2012,"seriously you need to think about what you are saying.an afk tag would be an imense boost to both afk and active cloakers.an active cloaker would simply wait until the afk tag appeared on himself, then wait for the null-bears to go ratting or mining, before pouncing.then the null-bears would complain that an afk tagged person attacked them, then the afk tag would be usless.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
8/10/2012,"the enemy just open a cyno?.... i thought we were talking about afk cloakers?um... i'm loosing track, why are you now talking about inactive players, you were clearly talking about an active player opening a cyno.once again, just like the multitude of posts on this subject, the real reason people are proposing all these nerf afk cloaking posts is revealed. the 'solution' is always a nerf to all cloakers, even active ones. but the remove cloakers from local, and thus making afk cloaking useless (if he cant do anything due to being afk, and you dont see him in local, then there is no afk cloaking issue), is always shot down by the original requesters because they would no longer get the free intel that a person was in the system. and this would mean they would have to be more careful, and maybe do a little more work when ratting or mining. (which it appeares they dont want to be bothered with)jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
8/10/2012,"it's called psychological warfare. frankly if you find a way to remove that from this game eve will fail.see what you are asking for is the removal of doubt from the unknown. that's a huge advantage because if you knew for sure then your enemy can't back door you, can't surprise you, can't out flank you or can't intimidate you.you are asking for everyone to play wit their hands showing and frankly if you played poker that's boring"
8/10/2012,"and when you are in alone in a system which is infected by cloaker. you really will go to ratting!!!really!!!!if you say yes you will lie. you dont know the cloaker afk or not. so, you wont go npcing. you just dont telling truth when you say, inactive players cant manipulate active players's game. with this bad gamemechanics.so they are possible threats.again just for you, maybe you need repeated answer or you can't understand anything:""we known active and passive terrors. such a bomb threat, no matter the bomb is existing or not exising.just a stupid man would go in a marketplace where is a bomb threat. cloaker in his solar system it's a same thing.""why ? because no one knows the bombs there or not.same when the players dont know the cloaker active there or not, afk or not!!!that's possible threat deal with it or leave."
8/10/2012,q.f.t.if you can't manage to deal with afk cloakers go back to highsec.
8/10/2012,"i have already cleaned this thread once, i do not expect to have to do it again. some of you are sailing very close to the wind when it comes to personal insults, so please note that it is not allowed and if it starts to happen again i will just lock this thread.please stick to the topic at hand, leave personal insults in your head and stick to discussing the mechanics, that should be a fairly simple task - isd type40.[b]isd type40 lt. commander community communication liaisons (ccls) interstellar services department[/b]"
8/10/2012,i can manage them and you too. that was the question gunslinger alt ?the question was inactive players why can manipulate active players game?
8/10/2012,"please don't call me a liar, especially since it isn't just me you're addressing but every single pilot in wormhole space. when we occasionally do pve we don't even know who is in local. we manage just fine. as do many pilots in nullsec. there are many ways to deal with ""afk cloakers"", hundreds, if not thousands of players have worked them out and use them often. you can too."
8/10/2012,"they can't.unless they somehow hack into your game and make you dock up or whatever, you are the one doing it. you are the one hiding and losing money. you are the one being in terror while they sit there and do nothing. you cannot do something while doing nothing. it is an impossibility.it is your own paranoia that causes you to dock up. not the cloaker.and ribi, cap/fuel for cloaks is the worst idea for this ever. not only would it be bottable, but it would destroy cloaking as a whole.edit: also, i have ratted with cloakies and hostiles in local (low, null, and possibly wh but not sure if they were there). never once got hit. and if i had, worst loss would have been a t1 bc."
8/10/2012,"so you say, you will go to ratting when a cloaker in your system and you are alone there."
8/10/2012,"absolutely. never fly what you can't afford to lose.if i'm flying it, i expect that i will lose it. so i don't care who might blow it up.oh... you were asking gunslinger..."
8/10/2012,"so you say too, you will go to ratting when a cloaker in your system and you are alone there. because you know the cloaker afk or not. :pi want your answer for this simple question."
8/10/2012,this answer is another prime example of a noob teaching pros.
8/10/2012,"i dont even know if there's a cloaky in my system because i live in wormholes. there might be zero, or one, or twenty cloaky t3s. i cope with it just fine though. as do many, many other players. as for nullsec, it's arguably a bit easier: you have local to tell you exactly who is in system with you, and you have static routes and channels for intel about the region/routes and the activity.to be honest, i don't even understand why we're discussing ""afk"" cloakies - the issue, obviously, is an active cloaky. might as well be discussing the hisec pilot who is logged off 30 jumps away; they both pose an equal threat: none."
8/10/2012,"yes... to the first question.rule #1 of eve: don't fly what you cannot afford (or are unwilling) to lose.i follow this rule, so i don't care if they may or may not be afk. i assume they are active, and continue with what i was doing.living in a wh for six months, you learn not to care.but really, i will not let myself impact my gameplay because of what someone else is not doing.edit: one exception. there was one incident where someone who had been hunting me for a while came into the system (was in avair i think...). i hightailed it out of there because i knew he was active and hunting."
8/10/2012,oh nooooo. no this stupidity again.
8/10/2012,"so, making money while someone sits afk is stupid, but docking up while they are afk is smart?"
8/10/2012,megalol . you are a noob player who everytime unnecessarily risk your ship ? maybe you are an oracle and you know the cloaker active or not. :pppi've never heard stupidest answer earlier.
8/10/2012,"no, i'm a semi-pro player who doesn't fly stupid, so i don't have to worry if i might lose my ship or not. its not a risk if i expect to lose it. just a bonus when i don't.and no, as i've said, i don't know if they are active or not. i don't care.also please stop with the non constructive personal attacks based on false premises."
8/10/2012,no you are a noob player if you go and risk your ship unnecessarily everytime when a cloaker in your system.
8/10/2012,"coming from and npc corp alt. or main... might be a main...its not a risk. i risk nothing. i already expect to blow up. if it happens, no loss. if it doesn't, yahoo, next day.every time you undock, there is a chance you will die. a corpmate could come and blow you up. spies, thieves, pirates, etc.and since this is a game (hope no one forgot that bit) it is always an unnecessary risk.edit: also they are never my systems. i just visit. usually i am the one intruding.edit2: have to run will be back later, enjoying the discussion... mostly."
8/10/2012,wait if i have neutral cloaker afk alts i cant realize how big noob you are if you go and risk your ship unnecessarily everytime when a cloaker in your system.ubermegalol. :d
8/10/2012,"did you really just say that anyone who risks their pixely spaceship is a ""noob""? it's only a game, man. i'd rather play a game with people who are willing to ""risk"" losing their imaginary spaceships in the name of fun than with people who will log off at the slightest whiff of danger. also, being able to reasonably judge a risk and make an informed decision about whether or not it is ""worth"" taking is not the act of a ""noob"". you may have got it a bit backwards, in fact."
8/10/2012,"wait, i'm coming from stevie wonder. :d"
8/10/2012,"new eden, as seen by ribikoka et al: if you don't immediately dock up and log off as soon as you see another player, even one who isn't even at the computer, you must be a mega noob7/10. lols were had. threadlock plz."
8/10/2012,lock thread because you and your corrina jar alts trolling and spamming every thread what not you like.please ban this peoples.
8/10/2012,"i do.... an afk cloaker will typically not stop me from ratting.... i've dealt with this issue a thousand times: 1.) if there is an afk cloaker in system, i typically rat in a t2 or cheapfit drake or talos, fit to pvp. if i'm feeling frisky, and don't consider the afk cloaker a legit threat, i'll use a tier 1 bs.... 2.) i don't warp to zero.... i make bm's in each belt, and use those to rat from... this also helps with ""raiders"" that come into system when i'm not paying close attention by often providing a few extra seconds to get safe (cause i often dual & triple box). 3.) if i'm feeling paranoid i'll align after i exit warp, i'll randomize my warp in ranges, as well as randomize which belt i travel to next... the truth is though, this grows tedious, and it's just easier to fit my ship for a fight, and wait for the bastard to decloak so i can gank him first!!! 4.) i look up the character on battleclinic or evekill, and see what he flies, who his associations are, and get an idea of what to expect.... is he going to titan drop me, bo drop me, attempt to solo me in a t3 or recon or sb, or is he going to tackle me long enough for his friends to arrive. 5.) i make sure i have an mwd and know how to use it... this allows me to power away from him, or power to him... depending on my mood... 6.) if he's a ""real"" threat... i rat in the system next door.... 7.) i have a goal.... if i get hotdropped, i want to gank more than i lose... .meaning if i'm in an 60-80m isk drake or cane, i want to take out a recon or 2x stealth bombers before i die..... sometimes i can, sometimes i can't. afk cloakers are soooo simple to deal with.... sure, it means you shouldn't be ratting in a carrier (unless it's bait) or faction/t2 bs, and so your isk / hour ratio suffers... but so what.... i personally don't mind a 30% reduction in pay for the extra excitement that a hotdrop provides... finally, as long as ""local"" is sooooo omniscient, i don't see any reason to hinder afk cloaking.... i want an actual intel system that is more balanced.... i think carebears deserve to know when a potential threat enters system in a very quick manner, but i feel there should be some ambiguity as to whether that new local is a friend or foe until you actually recon them!!!"
8/10/2012,"ok i think that's more than enough. you were asked to stay on topic and refrain from personal attacks, yet you seem unable to do so, that leaves me no choice but to lock this thread as moderation and polite requests seem to have no impact.in future post responsibly, thank you - isd type40.thread locked due to incessant trolling and personal insults.[b]isd type40 lt. commander community communication liaisons (ccls) interstellar services department[/b]"

8/11/2012,the only thing i disagree with are capital ships in c1-4 whs. i personally enjoy killing some noob who just got his carrier out of the oven sitting on a high sec wormhole in a c1 lol.maybe that's just me.
8/11/2012,"i agree, boosts should be on grid.miners may not like their orca on grid with them in a wormhole but then again that's the price of getting boosts."
8/11/2012,"this could be difficult since sometimes the grid is not correct and you cant see 35km anything... i am having it right now where i only see 70km radius of this icebelt, and not the full ~300 kilometers"
8/11/2012,"raising some more attention to this, i'm hoping at the very least that these factors will be taken into consideration with the pos replacement discussed in the csm meeting, but to be honest i don't think this should wait any longer than it has already and think this is something worth placing into the very next available patch."
8/11/2012,"i think it would be cool to get a dedicated ore gas mining ship.edit for statsrole 5% extra ""gas bay"" space per level of ore industrial5% more gas yield or range (questionable)""gas bay"" would hold about 5,000 m3"
8/11/2012,cool: yes.needed: no.better things for devs and art folks to spend time on: absolutely.supported: not at this time.
8/11/2012,"not needed more than a ""mining frig""?if they have time to make a useless frig when there are already mining cruisers that take days to get in to they can make a gas ship lol.heck they could even put a bonus on a ship that's already made, the noctis and preme (how ever it's spelled) look alike why not just recolor it and put the ability to have gas harvesters on it and a ""gas hold"""
8/11/2012,you know this is not such a bad idea. better than that useless mining frigate... please =)i support this idea *thumbs up*- rikuedit: i think you mean the primae. which is in some way very useless. they could make that into that gas miner.
8/11/2012,"the mining cruisers are being replaced with tieracide. in a short time there will be no mining ships other than the ore ones.as it is, current bcs do fine at gas mining. and those bcs are not being replaced in such a way that gas mining with them will no longer be viable."
8/11/2012,"pretty neat, i support this +1"
8/11/2012,"ok...i hate minmatar ships really but i just took a look at the stabber...is this a joke?i mean really...that ship is now the ship that looks the most like a penis in eve and it is called the ""stabber""?come on! lol!"

8/12/2012,"now a thing to keep in mind, is these are very rough designs based off of the original freighter hulls, and were put together on ms paint, so not exactly the best medium to work with. but all four of them are finally done, so discuss, and contact your csm reps to let them know we want these.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
8/12/2012,"but they are replacing the frigs that have mining bonuses and cruisers with mining bonuses with a frig that has a mining bonus... there is no ship that has a gas role in eve.what your saying is ""destroyers do fine salvaging, we dont need the noctis."" what kind of logic is that?"
8/12/2012,we didn't need the noc noc. we got it because enough people wanted a dedicated salvager. too bad it killed salvage value.there's also no ship that gets a bonus to archaeology and hacking.
8/12/2012,"oh but there is, it was a free ship given to us one year. the echelon was a free ship with a purloined sansha codebreaker on it.why not stop making free ships for x-mas and make ships that get used...(edit)there is also a zephyer that can't be targeted by sleepers, and a apotheosis, and the primae for pi. these are ships they made just to hand out for free once a year thats not counting the ships that got re-colored, like the special edition shuttle i have and the iteron amastris edition and the quafe ultra edition and finally the quafe ultramarine edition...they can't make a dedicated gas mining ship?(second edit)it killed high sec salvage value, my melted nano ribbons are doing just fine at 6.7million a piece lol"
8/12/2012,wardeccing a system would be nice. basically claiming ownership so that you could do as much piracy as you wanted with no gains within that system. or some way to gain sovereignty which means you don't loose standings. locking all combat capital ships out of lowsec completely. if you wanna move caps around do it in 0.0 with an army supporting you. the way they were intended to be moved.
8/12/2012,i like a lot of the ideas here. only issues i see is the separate black market being a little problematic. however the biggest issue in this is the overlord idea. it looks good on paper but what will happen is large null sec alliances will move their fleets in to low sec systems near them to take control of them. so that way it will ether: 1. hinder enemy cap travel 2. adds an extra level of income for the alliance. 3. provides a slightly better safety net in the event of fail cascade.the overlord idea would be pulling nullsec alliances to low sec. instead of new people from high sec. this can ether be good or bad depending on your opinion of player owned null sec.edit: i can already hear the goons broke overlord lowsec system complaints now.
8/12/2012,"hello all,i understand why bpcs aren't available on the common market and must be contracted. however, there are a lot of bpcs that are dropped by rats or attained by missions or lp stores that have set material and production efficiencies. i see no reason that these blueprints shouldn't be introduced on the market, and create competition and a new role in the game.i'm talking about blueprint copies like the empire faction ships or module bpcs (such as the caldari navy ballistic control unit) attained from the lp store and tag missions, or the pirate faction ships like the gila, and even cosmos blueprints like the ones from the missions or lp store. there's probably a hundred or so blueprints that could be added, injecting a slight boost into cosmos crafters and making the finished items more available.note that this is not an urgent change, and should probably be put on the back burner for an opening, but it is something that might improve the game. constructive criticism on this idea is welcome, but i believe it's pretty basic.- bunyip"
8/12/2012,"currently its extremely difficult to grow a faction warfare corps income without donations from its members, mission running corps of old used to do this through standard tax as a lot of the reward was in isk.corps should be able to tax lp too so they can develop an income and grow their assets. this would make it easier for the fw corps of today could become the 0.0 corps of tomorrow."

8/13/2012,i support the proposal. love it.
8/13/2012,"the echelon does not get a bonus to hacking. the only thing it can do is be used in some incursion sites... not sure which as i don't do them. but regular hacking it cannot do.also, using the gifts as an example is a very bad idea. do you want a gas mining ships that is totally useless even for its stated task?the zepher is outdone by all scanner ships, and cloaked ships won't be attacked by sleepers anyway.the apotheosis is just a shuttle.the primae is useless for anything other than bait/hanger ornament. even a t1 indie does pi related hauling better.itterons: no better than the t1 versions, and big bulls eye saying ""gank me"".salvage:yes you are correct, i did forget that for the most part, wh salvage has survived the plummet of value.i would much prefer ccp finish all the other things they are working on before adding another ship that will just need to be balanced after a few days. i'm not even fond of the free things. a much better holiday gift would be to have crimewatch, v3, ship rebalance, fw, pos, null tech finished/fixed... pick any of those.but another ship? not needed."
8/13/2012,"that's my point, they waste time on these ships that do literally nothing...i figured if they would have time to do that why not make a ship that is useful, instead of an empty hull that never gets used.i would like to see a boatload of other stuff as well...1. corp role redo2. pos overhaul so i would actually want to bring other people in to a wormhole instead of discouraging them by leaving them outside the hole until i fully get to know them. (otherwise they can take almost anything or have access to nothing...)3. fw to be fun again, but that's up to the players in a sandbox game like this. if people lose the will to fight because the other sides better, that is a player problem. (other than the war dec crap that goes on.)but if they are wasting time making a ship hull anyway why not make it useful in some way and throw the bpos out there.hell make it take minerals from omber so it balances the ore out a little bit because that ore is about worthless to mine as is."
8/13/2012,"i see.yeah, if they insist on doing ships, a gas miner that was useful rather than a gift that only says ""gank me"" would be nice.i'd still rather they focus on finishing/fixing.if they want to do a holiday gift, just make snowballs available again. npcs can sell them (isk sinc) or they can be made from ice stuff, whatever."
8/13/2012,there will be hacking frigates and possibly t2 versions:
8/13/2012,sleeper sites can be rather heavy on decloak hazards though...
8/13/2012,i have seen quite a few posts about people wanting wanting to take down offline towers and people wanting to keep them. i can see a reason to have offline towers in a wormhole high sec ect.here are my thoughts and some random ideas to be able to have offline towers if you want them and be able to take down ones that are truly abandoned.1.) offline poss should use up a very small amount of fuel to keep the shields and resistances online. (a sleep mode if you will.)a.) this lets you spike towers at moons to prevent other poss from being set up to help defend your wormholeb.) the small amount of fuel would be the cost for the defensec.) prevents most exploits for taking down an offline tower that i can think ofd.) with no fuel it should drop the shields 50% and have 0 resists (just a thought may be a bad idea)e.) sleep mode poss may be able to online quicker (another maybe idea)2. )offline towers (with no fuel) should be able to be hacked with a hacking mod and have a low percentage rate making it mandatory to have t2 hacking mod (and maybe implants for hacking)a.) this would allow you to take down old towers with no fuel in the bay so people can clean out places that have just been left to rot.3.) pos mods that are connected to the tower (with no fuel in the tower) could be hacked the same way but make it destroy whatever is inside as if you un-anchored the mod.a.) this would let you own the mods to take the tower down because you can not un-anchor a tower without taking down the mods firstb.) by destroying the items inside it prevents pos bashers from using this mod to take everything in corp hangers or smas without the risk of blowing up the items.

8/13/2012,"by the way, the problem isn't the actual 1 man corp... that person doesn't undock. the problem is if i get into an incursion fleet and spread around space aids then it is easier for larger corps to sneak they're space aids in therefore no public incursion fleets will run with anyone at war no exceptions"

8/13/2012,"quick explanation...removes the incentive to leave enemy controlled systems in a vulnerable state, instead of capturing them.systems are defendable.offensive plexes who run away will lose out.should encourage plexes to stay and therefore fight.removes the ability to speedtank plexes.offensive plexes (particularly larger ones) will need multiple ships and therefore provide the possibility of bigger fights in bigger ships."

8/14/2012,"ah, zephers. mostly they are fun for testing the water in w-space on sisi."
8/14/2012,"a gaz harvesting ship should adress some of the specificity of gaz mining:-slow yield. an average ladar sites in nullsec containing 3000 units of gaz takes 3h20 to deplete to a single pilot with perfect skills (not counting implants and fleet boost). largest clouds contains 9000 units, which takes 10 man-hout to harvest completely.-high volume. a unit of nullsec gaz is 10 m3. that's 30 000 m3 for an average gas cloud in nullsec.-surviving ability: be it from gaz clouds explosions, spawning npcs or hostile players (most ladar sites are in nullsec and wormholes), battlecruiser sized-tank is usually required. being able to take on small spawns of npcs would be a nice ability, as it's currently hard to fit weapons with 5 turret slots reserved to harvesters. a reduction to the risk of gas cloud explosion (like the old skiff had for mercoxit) may serve such a purpose, but would also put the player in a more dangerous situation, as gaz cloud explosions are a fine way to defend yourself against a tackling frigate."
8/14/2012,"i don't see how smaller corps or alliances can survive with no pos shield. i know the csm minutes are just thoughts and theory flying around, but the thought of no force field around the new poss i think will discourage a lot of the smaller wormhole corps.1. docking is nice, but these new poss better have good defense, otherwise pos camping will be the new name of the game.2. mooring is kind of an odd way to store ships and better have a bump prevention otherwise these mooring mods will be useless3. if pos camping (know as station camping in high sec and low sec) becomes regular i think you will see a lot of frustrated players who just quit wormholes all together.a lot of the lower class wormholes are full of 2 and 3 man poss, and if you think wormholes seem empty now... wait till more people move out with lack of pos protection.~edit~this is what i would like to see.the ability for your personal space home to have the means to be upgraded to the ""resource"" consumption of a large tower. i know they don't plan on using pg and cpu for the new towers so what ever resource they plan on using i would like to have the ability to buy the same kind of defense for my personal home (because i bought it all solo and take care of it solo, no one else wants to take care of it)the option to upgrade your ship storage small med large kinda thing. the thought of using mooring mods to store ships makes me cringe and want to facepalm the fact it was even thought of. the larger the ship storage the more it can hold and the more you will pay when you buy the mod. 3 types of ship storage modssmall: should let you fit a few 2 bcs 2 cruisers atleast 1 or 2 frigs with maybe the space for 1 haulermed: should let you add 2 or 3 battleships 1 or 2 bc 2 cruisers 1 or 2 frigs and a space for a haulerlarge: would be for the capital ships carriers, dreads, orca, rorq ect. so it would only have the space to hold 1 or 2 capital shipsi agree with two step on knowing how many people are docked and maybe what ship they are in because you can do that now with the way poss are set up. when you hit the info button on the ""pos"" it should show an information window that has a slot for ""docked players"" next to that would have an info button and would show a list of players (online only) and what ships they are in. (only because you can do that now with the pos system by warping to the tower and looking to see who is in the bubble, if you don't want to show up on the list hop in your cloaky and stay cloaked in a safe spot.)"
8/14/2012,pos changes are at least 9 months away and have had absolutely no serious details released yet.
8/14/2012,"i like the idea as long as your ship icon stayed on grid long enough to see where you went.all you would really have to do to make going into and coming out of warp look super sweet would be to remove that instance when the ship stops, and make the engine trails much brighter and stay longer. with engine trails back, going into warp looks way cooler especially from a 3rd person prospective, its just that you have to be right on top of the ship to see it, and since the trails go away during warp, you dont get the trails coming out of warp until your stopping, and you've already been on grid for some time by then. so making the engine trails more intense when the warp drive is active and making it so they do not disappear in warp would make the effect look much cooler without having to make drastic changes to the graphics and not changing the mechanics at all. plus it would let you know when someone hit the warp button because there trails just got bright as all hell. also.. please add the same effect that we see when going through planets to other things like stations also."

8/15/2012,"i think the csm has raised your points in the meeting minutes. still, speaking out is a good thing. ccp has mentioned that w-space dwellers are a major part of their consideration in all of this. your needs and your corp's needs should be voiced."
8/15/2012,from what two step has been saying it sounds like removing the forcefield is already something thats been decided.i'd rather people start raising concerns now than just sitting back and seeing how it turns out (i.e. terrible) and then having to spend two years desperately trying to get ccp to un-**** everything
8/15/2012,"basically, the forcefield mechanic causes a lot of nasty code issues and dependencies that shouldn't be there (having the pos code tangled up with the physics code does wonders for maintainability, no?)"
8/15/2012,"at this point we need to be talking about what we want to see in pos revisions rather than responding to rumors, speculation, and passing remarks by devs. let's focus on contributing to the revisions so that ccp has a clearer picture of what players want to see.let's wait for the devblog that tells us their current direction before we go off fighting battles that are probably pointless.edit: seriously, all this bluster about pos camping in w-space is rather silly, don't you think? it's not like they said you won't be able to put guns on the pos. who's going to tank a properly-fitted pos just on the hopes you'll undock?"
8/15/2012,"the same people who tank gate guns and station guns? people do it in low sec all the time...it depends on how much protection you can put on your personal pos, if i can spend the isk to have the protection i have now i would be ok with no pos shield. now if they make it to where you have to have 15 or 20 of the little ""player space homes"" to have the protection i have now, i'm not going to be happy at all.poss with a force field lets you warp away even when there are 20 people sitting outside your pos, if you have to undock those 20 people are going to mess you up.(there are ways around this, insta warps ect. but you still have that chance if ccp does something like caldari stations where you don't always come out aligned to your insta warp.)secondly, i should be able to store my ships in my space home, not tethered to a mod where eve gods and everyone can see them... the talk about mooring mods replacing smas for ship storage is a no go."
8/15/2012,"summaryhow should tiericide affect industrial ships?here are some ideas:idea 1) give three per race: defensive, fast, large cargoidea 2) give two per race: defensive, large cargoidea 3) leave them tiered.idea 4) make a great hauler and mini-frieghterside idea 1) navy industrialsside idea 2) role bonusbad idea 1) just make one line of ore haulerssynopsisi was waiting for someone else to bring this up (maybe even with a solution), but tiericide does leave industrial ships in an odd position.right now, this is where we are at:caldari and amarr have 2 (amarr used to have one).minmatar have 3.gallente have 5.five... sheesh, one for each level and no one else even has four. it is the most tiered line of ships in the game. even the names of the ships are tiered, such as the iteron mark v. speaking of which, this ship has received controversy since rigs were introduced. while paper-thin, it can haul more than a t2 variant, which aren't so strong themselves. if it was given raw tiericide, it would require gallente industrial 1 to fly. this will make the critics of the ship rather upset.idea 1obviously this is not what would happen in proper tiericide. the movement is about making ships each have value rather than be stepping-stones. the iteron 5 problem aside, it seems to me that three types of haulers are needed: type 1) good defensestype 2) good speedtype 3) good cargo holdfor this to happen, caldari would need a new hauler and so would amarr. minmatar would be fine, and gallente would have two removed. racial differences would come into play here too. amarr and caldari would have better defenses. minmatar would have better speed. gallente would remain best-in-class for cargo. (i think the ""mark #"" names should go for caldari and gallente btw.)for this to work, the static bonuses would have to change. racial defensive bonuses would be needed for type 1. a think a bigger base speed and the current speed bonus would work for type 2. for type 3, a modest base hold and a larger cargo bonus would be in order.idea 2a variation of this would be to remove ""type 2 / speed"" and make minmatar a near equal in cargo with better speed. the advantage here is that no new ships would be needed. the models would already be decided based on t2 versions. this means that the iteron 5 would be gone, to the cheers of critics and tears of traders. side idea 1there is one thing that i can think of to do with one or two of the unused hulls: navy issue industrials. for the amarr and caldari, they get a paint job. for the minmatar, i vote for letting go of the old wreathe and go for a repainted mammoth. for the gallente, they get back the iteron 5 but with a new paint job. navy ships would have more ehp, but not bonuses to help them. the traditional speed and cargo are one option for bonuses. i would like to see 3 turret/missile hard-points and a damage bonus for small guns and light missiles, personally. the max cargo hold would have to be smaller than a retriever's max cargo hold (ya, ppl would still afk with it).i doubt many people would like this idea, but it makes good use of the ship models. ore ships at least have a flight of light drones to shoot back with. navy industrials with light arms make sense to me. we do see npc industrials that attack. wtb: blood raider industrial with small cap-drain bonus. >:}idea 3just leave them tiered as is. i don<U+FFFD>t like this idea, but it is the simplest solution to a convoluted problem. a small buff to narrow the gap between the best and worst haulers would be nice. a buff in hp would also be helpful as dps has risen in the game. reducing cpu is also an option as that is a holdover from a system that was never implemented.imho, the cpu was left because of how weak the ships are. this gave the option of ewar and extra shields. if ehp is raised in general, the cpu would not be needed. wtb: mordus hauler with shield and ecm bonus. >:}side idea 2speaking of that mysterious massive amount of cpu, maybe those systems should be revisited. i heard that they were a deep space life style module. others say they were for strip miners before ore was introduced as a ship line. i<U+FFFD>d like to hear from devs what that mysterious utility would have been. perhaps give industrials a role bonus. heck, at this point, maybe it could tie into supplying dust with something. in other words, a special bonus to industrials was originally planned and is not a bad idea.this is a half-formed idea, but i think the original intensions of the industrial should be considered (and revealed).idea 4right now there is a gap between industrials and freighters. filling that gap could be the difference in ships. the smaller ones would be cheaper, much faster, more slots/fittings, and get a light ehp boost. the larger ship would need an agility bonus, get a big boost in ehp, loose some slots, and get a nice cargo hold (maybe a small ship hanger or pi hold).i think it would be interesting to give the first one a defensive and speed bonus. the lack of a cargo bonus would let it be both the strong defense and speed ship. a large base cargo hold can replace the bonus. the <U+FFFD>mini-freighter<U+FFFD> would get a cargo hold and agility bonus.bad idea 1another more radical method would be to remove racial haulers. the problem is that that would not jive well with t2s and freighters. i think we can all agree that it would make a mess. if this was years ago, i think pure ore industrials would have made sense, but not now. it's a moot issue, but an option i wanted to bring up and shoot down."

8/15/2012,"i run a fair amount of logistics for our corp and alliance. currently, when moving a lot of items for different people, the best method of keeping things straight seems to be creating courier contracts and setting them up to alts, then trading them back.a simple solution could be a ""create pallet"" option for multiple items in station, since courier contracts will box everything up nice and neat for you anyway... this would save a lot of time and trouble.thoughts?"
8/15/2012,"you'd think one'd just use containers for this...but there's no size between 3900m3 inside a gsc and the oh...100,000m3 that fits in a general freight container. although, is there a reason you can't simply have people put their hauling requests in as corp (or alliance) courier contracts in the first place?"
8/15/2012,"that's how we run most freight for individuals, but there are times when either that system won't work for the occasion, or we're trying to move many things for the alliance while keeping them separate at the same time.also, smaller freight containers could be another useful solution"
8/15/2012,"not entirely sure what the ""create pallet"" does that a courier contract doesn't... (other than ""not costing 10k isk"")?"

8/15/2012,eh? courier contracts are station to station ... where do you need an alt for setting one up?

8/16/2012,"no one at all has said that would be the issue. the issue is when someone decides to bring enough people to knock over a pos, they'll bubble the undock and sit everything on it. defending fleets having to ""undock"" into that would be hell. at least with a forcefield they can't completely cover the entire area. fleets can properly form inside the forcefield and pop out at an angle that gives them a possibility of doing something."

8/17/2012,"current situation:as a member of fleet, it is very difficult to determine what fleet bonuses you receive. while we have a green check box to indicate we are receiving some type of bonus, this is not adequate. fleet bonuses, in their current form, are buggy and do not always work as they should. often the fleet manager must revoke and re-assign booster positions to make them work, especially in regards to warfare links. to actually determine which bonuses we are receiving requires right clicking on a ship or module and comparing its attributes to theoretical eft numbers. this is, at best, cumbersome and typically not practical. proposed solution:add a new tab to the fleet window ui (or elsewhere) that lists all the fleet bonuses a pilot is currently receiving, who is providing them, and what their fleet position is. example:fleet bonus tab: ______________________________________________________________________________10% bonus to armor from fleet booster (fbcharactername)10% bonus to targeting range from fleet booster (fbcharactername)10% bonus to scan resolution from fleet booster (fbcharactername)2% bonus to mining yield from fleet booster (fbcharactername)15% bonus to shields from wing booster (wbcharname)28.12% bonus to shield resistances from wing booster (wbcharname)28.12% reduction to cap use of shield boosters & transporters from wing booster (wbcharname)28.12% reduction to duration of shield boosters & transporters from wing booster from wing booster (wbcharname)15% bonus to agility from squad booster (sbcharname)48.52% bonus to the range of propulsion disruption modules from squad booster (sbcharname)________________________________________________________________________________pros:1.) this really allows people to see what boosts they are getting, and allows them to rectify it when they aren't getting boosts they desire. 2.) it might help us to finally debug the fickle fleet booster issues. i can't tell you how many times we've had to revoke a booster and then re-designate them as a booster just to get their bonuses to pass correctly. 3.) this provides the individual pilot a tool to be situationally aware of major changes to their ship's performance. cons:none that i can think of, at least from a game-play stand point. related discussions: f&i: provide a fleet bonus information tab - by gizznitt malikitef&i: view fleet bonuses with ui - by honiahakaf&i: feature request: fleet bonus menu info - by richard m227an incomplete and open csm issue raised in may 2010, ""fleet ui - show warfare links"" - by corving... i was unable to find a corresponding discussion thread."

(just like the ceo is only allowed to unrent an office but the role rent office doesn't allow unrenting. capiche?)in the interests of helping ceos encourage industry-minded n00bs get into that career, by allowing them to install jobs from the corporate hangars (without needing factory manager role), ccp needs to prioritize fixing the corporate roles.as it currently stands, the role 'factory manager' is needed for many actions specifically 'cancel job' whether it be r&d or manufacturing and installing corporate jobs.ccp needs to alter that so the role to cancel a job is a separate role than install. that will fix that problem. this game is wonderful because of the element of risk, but it's also interesting because of the level of effort one needs to put into doing anything - please correct this insanely easy way to grief that scares any sane ceo/director from giving 'factory manager' simply to allow someone to take advantage of those players' skills in research and manufacturing.why is this so important to me to be above many other needed fixes? because it shouldn't be child's play to grief. yes, risk is supposed to be part of eve but to make it mindbogglingly simple for a bully to interfere with another with hardly an effort seems to speak volumes about who designed this game. bullies? hey, i'm just saying what the carebears are thinking when they unsub."

8/18/2012,"hi, i have recently tried salvaging in game which has been fun but is slow and kind of bland. i had out a warrior scout drone which got me thinking while it sat doing nothing while i salvaged, there should be salvager drones, the same as there are mining drones.salvager drones could be fairly easy to implement, there would just need to be another drone skill to learn. increased ranks in the skill could increase the drone's salvage chance, the same as the salvage skill for players. there could also be tech 1 and 2 drones like the salvager 1 and 2 modules, the tech 2 drones could have better salvage chances and work on more difficult wrecks.i think the drones would be quite fair, they could be used by any ship with drone capabilities, the same as any ship with a high slot can use a salvager module. there are often a lot of wrecks to salvage so having a ""salvage crew"" of drones would allow players to salvage several ships at a time. they would also give the benefit of greater salvaging range, like mining drones can reach further than the player's mining vessel.the drone salvaging itself should be the same as a salvager module, there could be cycles and each cycle has a chance of salvaging the wreck, later on some implants could be added to the game which increase their success chances, or even an upgrade module could be made that increases chances or speeds up the cycles.some ships are considered salvage ships (from what i understand at least) i heard one was the noctis, anyway, some ships could have salvage chance bonuses for modules and drones as well.that's all i can think up on the spot thanks for reading! like if you agree!"

8/21/2012,"ok my 2 centspos are too badly bugged they need to be fixed, or removed no middle ground the gms have been failing badly to assist in a timely manner with nullsec pos issues, leading to billion isk+ losses, and people quitting the gameenoughif ccp can't sort out pos, then they need to be removed completely, and more versatile ""micro stations"" added just give the damn station windows so you can see if there are ships outside it"
8/21/2012,"lol lady flute, aparently every avenue of the game ccp and gm's are causing billions of isk losses and doing nothing to progress the game how bout u stfu and stop trolling every thread in here"
8/21/2012,this doesn't mean they aren't being discussed now
8/21/2012,"stations currently not destructible pos arepos currently not modular, stations arewhy aren't they just amalgamating the two structures into 1 ?why not just a more scalable modular pos that could cost upward of 1-200b with all the right modules installed on it but allow small corps to get into a pos for 500m-1b with a very small amount of services available?it would allow more selective dynamic pos for small corpswould still allow the right balance for large alliancesccp would only have *1* structure to **** with instead of 2 when dealing with development issueswould also be a great isk sink when blown uptie some of the new taxation (for alliance, corp, taxes on everything - as mentioned in the minutes) into the pos mechanic - tax on station services for instancecould also be tied into a new sov system later - ie number of modules+module upgrades in the system being used by people etcand just plainly - a better lowsecthey could still look different dependant upon what modules are installed etcexample:living in low-sec running a mining corp with a refinery module, a small market module, cloning module and some defensive modules could cost you 10b, but it's ok cause you make it back over time - the 3 refinery modules you installed allow a 3% tax on minerals, your market module only allows 1% tax, but the offices you just installed are now raking in 30m/office/monthetcseems like a no-brainer - but i'm not ccp and this could be too big a change"
8/21/2012,"the problem isn't the 'difficulty of the computations' in terms of cpu cycles on the server, it's a matter of code structure and design the current pos code has its sticky paws in way too many parts of the eve codebase (which is part of the reason why it became so decrepit and bug-infested), and that'll have to change, including forcefield removal as the current tangling of pos forcefield handling with the rest of the physics engine leads to, well, nastiness"
8/21/2012,"in high sec at least, why not just have towers continue to consume starbase charters when offline?"
8/21/2012,"title says it all. i vote no confidence in the current gms, due to horrible failures of timeliness in dealing with nullsec bugs and stuck petitions, contributing to massive isk losses by players and cancelled subscriptions.there are commercial gm service provider companies out there who do outstanding jobs in other pvp games. in my view eve palyers would be better served by ccp outsourcing the gm services for eve to companies that do a better job of providing timely and appropriate levels of gm services.late responses (>24 hours for stuck requests), repeated circular dialogue with players, condescending, insulting, and evasive answers by gms, are all examples of things that are simply not appropriate for a pay-to-play pvp game. when you refuse to help and worse insult customers who are paying us$ to play the game, your business is never going to thrive. i can simply spend my money elsewhere. over the years hundreds of thousands of eve players ahve done exactly that for many reasons: but incompetent gm services should never be a reason players leave.further, whether ccp retains the current gms for eve or not, i would like to see the world of darkness gm services outsourced. why? because the current ccp gms are badly tainted by apparent favouritism and condoning exploits made by certain corporations in eve. while this is not the place to debate the detail of such allegations, which ccp denied, it would be a wonderful opportunity for ccp to start fresh with external gm service providers who are not tainted by such perceptions.while others are obviously welcome to disagree with my views, and this is a discussion forum so healthy debate should be welcomed by all (not flaming please), in my view the gm services are now a factor holding back the commerical potential of this game. they need to get better, or get replaced."
8/21/2012,"a vote of no confidence in this op. for serious.my gm service experience has been absolutely fabulous. well, it could be better naturally, if i could file petitions to get free isk and a few super caps in hisec stations....."
8/21/2012,the petition queue ccp's gm's use is the same as any other company. outsourcing gm jobs just because thing take some time doesn't mean things would improve at all from the current process.put your big-boy pants on and learn to be patient.
8/21/2012,"spreadsheets are very useful to industrialists everywhere. however alt-tabing and manually entering data is time consuming and boring, not to mention counter intuitave. as you already have note pads and calculators in the 'accessories' tab why not also have a basic spreadsheet. nothing fancy like macros, maybe just a basic spreadsheet with simple formulas. been able to copy/paste from info panes, dump market data into a spreadsheet etc would save time and be immersive to all us spaceship industrialists and accountants!"
8/21/2012,as described in quoted petition
8/21/2012,"i always assumed it was tied to the windows double-click timer, as you can adjust it there. as that doesn't seem to be the case, i'd suggest to ccp that they do that. that way users don't have to make the same adjustment in the os and the application."

8/22/2012,keeping this at the top - not that the csm or ccp really cares given the topics & replies in other related & unrelated threadshrolt ceo live free; die proud
8/22/2012,"for the new overhaul ccp could change the mechanism of the refinery, giving it job slots instead of the refine button it would be easier to code and make skills relevantalso, if ccp wants to make things better for pos use, and encourage player to have individual poses or join corporations, they can set a fix % of the ""we take"" that can't be reduced with standing or rise the actual ""we take"" on npc stations these way people would use pos to refinealso take a look at this and say what you think, it is about the new pos system i would really appreciate if someone from csm could spend a couple of minutes in it"
8/22/2012,"i think there must be stations, outposts and poses for what ccp is planning for the new pos, the big diference bwtween pos and outpost is that outpost dont consume fuel and cant be destroyed, whille pos are gonna be better and consume fueltake a look at this tread, there are some things that you may like!"
8/22/2012,"i've seen a few posts like this. it seems that this is becoming a problem. i would like to know what ccp or he csm think of the issue.i, myself, have seen a few more around lately here and there. at least they are destructible.for highsec, just pay for a wardec. i'm so gald npc corps cannot use them."
8/22/2012,for highsec they should just let anyone shoot poses that have been offline for more than 2 weeks.
8/22/2012,"eve has lot of trials. lots of new ppl come and try it. eve became a quite popular game in the mmo world. the thing is eve doesnt retain so much of those trials.pve needs to be re restructured form bottom to top. a whole year (2 expansions) at least should be dedicated to pve.missions:- new missions, new arcs, new cosmos.- better ai- missions for more ppl (3,5,10)- new type of missions ""challenge missions"" (not instanced): kill a bs of every pirate faction, kill 10 ships in low sec etc.exploration:- more interesting sites- different analyzing, hacking and salvaging mechanics (random generated puzzles, tricks)- meaningful discoveries: nex stuff, patches (u patch your ship which gives u 1% missile velocity etc.), archeology which would give u achievements in form of certificates.- wis type exploration after docking into abandoned sites.minning- new mining mechanics added to already existing one.- afk mining should stay because lots of ppl approve it.- new mechanics would be more interactive and could allow 2 and more ppl to cooperate which would yield more ore.- moon mining in high sec with bargeswis- poker rooms- espionage tactics- theft tacticsindustry- some additional mini games to the already existing production mechanics. where if u decide to do them if u are good u can min/max the production output.just few things i had in mind."
8/22/2012,"+1i have played other mmo's and after the trial i base my decision to subscribe on if there more to do. with eve it seems like the common response is ""do what you want, its a sandbox"" or "" there is no 'end-game' just train for what you need"" after the fir"
8/22/2012,"better ai? making missions current missions any easier or harder is a huge no no.cosmos missions should be removed or be made repeatable every 3 months or so like epic arcs.you can run missions in a group now, or run incursions, if they put level 5s back in highsec it would better though.-more sites is fine using different skills is also ok""patches"" are called implants they exist, certificates are uselessno docking with sites for wis exploration, this makes it almost a mandatory feature.-new mining mechanics such as? anything to make mining interactive means your distracted against ganks so nomoon mining with barges could be ok but i don't see it happening.if you want players to stay they need to get them in a slightly bigger ship sooner. the frigate rebalancing will help i think as well as the new destroyer."
8/22/2012,"pve needs tweaks and additions, not a trash and redo.patches? um, we have those. they are called rigs.the mission ai: already a world better, but improvement in fluidness would be good.new missions: ya, they should have a couple a patch and improve less popular ones.multi-man missions: yes. ccp wants those two. i do l4s solo and with friends. it is a great way to help young players earn isk. it is a great way to help older players build standings. it is a bad way for me to earn isk. splitting loot is a pain. time is not cut in half, so isk/hr suffers. i'm fine with that for a younger player, but i should be able to earn more with an older one. l4s were designed to require two people, but it has not worked out that way.challenge missions could be interesting. more pay out for faster kills or working out of order (ever blitz save the damsel?). a protection mission, where payout is based on how many ships you save, would be cool. i would like to see missions have different challenges in them. say, they want someone alive, the toughest bounty, and you have to leave him/her/it; plus save other ships, which it targets. that would enter logistics and ecm into missions. heck, a keep-alive mission where you are pure logistics would be change, and you could go against factions w/o penalty.mining: needs an overhaul. afk should not be encouraged; active mining should yield better results.group mining has always been better than solo mining imho. it is even better with the orca. even without the orca and only two ppl you are better off. snag the basic leadership skill, have someone always mine, someone haul p/t, and you are both ahead."
8/22/2012,can i vote for no confidence in op?
8/22/2012,sure.most parliaments have a vote of no confidence system. i honestly thought this would contribute to the legitimacy of the csm adding another control to it.if it doesn't work i guess it doesn't work.
8/22/2012,i second this motion. cpp implement now.
8/22/2012,"says the person from the alliance including players who are usingknown exploits in nullsec safe in the knowledge that the gms will take 24 hours+ on a sunday to even acknowledge the petition, and typically 2 or 3 days later before they actually get around to investigating. which of course means the exploit is done and dusted, save for screenshots which at best show only corp and alliance tickers - not nearly enough to take enforcement action against those intentionally taking advantage of tardy gm systems and bad programming.sorry, goonwarm players have been profiting handsomly from bad gm service, and ccp is happy for that to contine. that is part of why ccp need to outsource - they have had too long a history of certain alliances doing very well out of certain design flaws and gm service failures.as for every company using the same streaming and processes, rubbish. alchemic dream were running gm services for adventurine sa in the pvp game title darkfall. they used que streaming like anyone else, but where active exploits were reported they promptly had an invisible gm appear and look to gather timely and impartial evidence of what was going on. eve are currently running a gm service with repsonse timings and gm comments that are directly comparable to blizzard's wow gm responses, which is simply not good enough for a pvp game that includes looting from other players. remember this is a pay to play game. there are no excuses for ccp not to deliver timely and courteous gm services, 24/7. if they cannot do that, then they invite rampant exploiting, botting, and other forms of cheating. guess what, they have not been able to attend to stuck ques inside 24 hours, and whole alliances have started exploiting when ccp isn't looking (not ours, we simply walked away from the bullshit that was going on in nullsec). addendum: i left darkfall some time ago to see what eve was like now, in anticipation of dust's launch. so my comments related to darkfall were from when i did play, i do not know who is providing gm services now in that game or their quality/timeliness. but i am saying there are gm service companies out there who really do ""get it"" about pvp free for all loot games, and have provided gm services that are better than what i have encountered in eve in the past months. pvp games live and die by the quality of thier gm services, which if too thinly stretched quickly lose control and exploits become rampant. gms giving tacit approval for people to exploit in nullsec is simply not acceptable to me - nor should it be to other players, or to ccp."
8/22/2012,"funny, one of our former alliance was mocking the gms in teamspeak about the bugged roqual the gm moved from their wormhole so it could be repackaged and returned ... the gm forgot to put it back. guess where the roqual was left. if you want super caps in highsec you just need to learn to work over the incompetent / overworked gms better, apparently."
8/22/2012,"i was talking to someone last night who said that he'd petitioned an in-space corp change. he'd engaged a wartarget in space and several people on grid immediately joined the corp and opened fire on him. the gm response was that that is acceptable.i personally have a warning for doing the exact same thing a day after the dec scraping ban was lifted (you know, when the gms said ""anything goes"" and then said ""anything but that"").gm consistency in rule enforcement seems to be getting worse. i'm not looking to be rid of them, i just want the gms to be more attentive."
8/22/2012,"i've actually had all of the petitions i have ever raised dealt with inside of 48 hrs. no one has ever belittled me or given me circular communication.i cant be an anomaly? can i?i have heard people raise similar concerns about other gm experiences, i guess i just have never had one personally myself.also when ever a gm processes your ticket, your given a chance to review there performance, enough bad reviews and im betting they wont be a gm for very long."
8/22/2012,so what are goons exploiting now in the next goons are cheating thread. gm's have always been helpful and quick with all my problems. did i always get what i wanted not but it was handled very quickly. i had 2 of my accounts hacked on the same day. i lost a fair bit of isk from it but they were able to do the best they could and the reasons they gave about why they couldn't just give my stuff back after it was sold on the market made sense.if your just going to whine about the gms are bad cause they don't exactly what you tell them then maybe this game isn't for you.
8/22/2012,"not only do i support the idea, but i was trying to think of features i would want it to have.i would want to be able to share and even export them.there should be corp and alliance sheets. public sharing should be an option too.an api or evegate version would be amazing.drag and drop with smart fill in would be so handy (drop a blueprint and it fills in what it needs).+1"
8/22/2012,"i think it's a bit strange that we don't have them already, given that eve is usually called spreadsheets online."
8/22/2012,"i was reading the latest minutes, particularly the part about kill contracts when the lightbulb hit me...revamp the contracts by having ccp create a number of standardized agreements that players could select and drag into a blank contract. this would allow an ""advanced"" option to create unique contracts above and beyond what is current offered. in the us we call this boilerplate- standard terms, usually legal, that are used with certain items filled in the blanks. think of those legal kits you can buy at office stores, or the company legal zoom. for example, standard choices might include the following:1. pick up ____ and deliver to station ______2. acquire ____ and deliver to station ______3. kill _____ ___ times4. receive payment of ___ for completed contract5. receive ____ for each primary objective.6. receive _____ for each secondary objective.there might be 100 or more such basic such terms, and could be dragged into a blank contract and filled in the empty spaces to look like this:(example contract)primary objectiveskill player boom boom longtime 1 timesecondary objectivesacquire player boom boom longtime's dog tags x1 and deliver to station jita 4-4 candari navyreceive 6 billion isk for each primary objective.receive 1 billion isk for each secondary objective.contract will be considered completed if all primary objectives are completed.such a system would address many of the player suggestions for various sorts of contracts, and ccp could add and remove contract terms as needed. this type of system would dramatically open the doors of new types of agreements and provide an easy framework for ccp to update the contracts system in the future with very minimal additional coding. it also allows more types of agreements without completely screwing up people's existing mechanisms. you also still allow scammers to be very creative while still allowing everyone else to formalize many agreements within an eve system.such a system on contracts could be used for:player bounty contractsexpanded courier choices (such as 1 contract to pickup from multiple stations with a single destination)pos defensemercenary servicesloansinvestment contractsplayer defense (like protect a miner from being killed for 24 hours to receive x isk etc)and so much more....the issues raises regarding blue/red status for the defense contracts could be addressed by allowing contracted players to attack aggressors who fire at a player or celestial object that is in the contract.please discuss!"

8/23/2012,"thing is about mining thas is vital for the economy and so for eve itself. a lot of ppl like afk mining (not a lot of hustle, smaller yield rate but still enough). if the afk mining is shut the economy would be a mess. everything would be so damn expensive. ccp needs to tweak it a bit more so that the active mining is lot more proficient than afk (like dobule more at least).about patches. someone said we got implants u said that we got rigs. what i ment was a 3rd layer. rigs u get from industry, implants from missions (lp), and these patches u d get only from exploring. it wouldnt give so much edge as the previous 2 mentioned above. u put it on the ship and it boost some atributes. i d made it small boosts but huge variety of patches. about certificate achievements and someone said is useless. well it wldnt give any kind of boosts or nerfs. it will add content for ppl that will go out explore find artifacts (on which some history will be explained) and u get the certificate that u found it. than u can sell that artifact. collectionars will show up.even now i just get some skills up so i get certain certificates that i find important."

8/23/2012,"how would goons exploiting the market or tech be considered bad gm customer service. i believe they should be fixing stuff like game crashing errors or bugs, not halting enterprising individuals using intended game mechanics."
8/23/2012,"everyone's experience will vary, and it is pleasing that some have experienced good gm services.just so you know it's no accident, several of former alliance were banned for selling the plex they bought off ccp. sure ccp realised how completely dumb that was, and reinstated thier accounts and gave them each a 24 hour credit on the respective accounts' game time, but they were still banned out of the game at a critical time in our nullsec activity.48 hours response is fine - if you are playing wow. in nullsec in a full loot pvp game, initial response to exploiting/stuck should be 20 minutes. not 48 hours. when ccp can't help in a timely manner things go from bad to worse fast in nullsec, and the losses that flow from bugs/exploits can often compound. either ccp needs to act in a far more timely manner, or they need to give the gms the policies and tools to fix the inevitable mess.i know precisely how to always win in pvp in nullsec. do what a couple of the super-rich alliances do, and simply clear away the evidence inside 24 hours. will i share the details? no, of course not. nor will i actually bother doing that - cheating to win is profitable, but not actually either fun or a worthy challenge. but there are those who can and will keep indulging in certain activities that are possible due to bad coding and gm response times that are simply too slow for a free for all full loot pvp game. sephiroth we ahve also had complaints appearing about obvious market price bots, that have been tracked by some players for months and repeatedly reported to the gms. the lack of action from ccp has called into question whether ccp has the technical competence or the will to actually do anything about those bots, which are doing serious damage to the eve in-game economy. i expressly make no comment on goons links to market or tech, as i have no evidence of any mischief by them in relation to either - what i am talking about is something entirely different. the bots i have had drawn to my attention are, unsurprisingly, from npc corporation toons - after all, you would have to be quite stupid to be running market manipulation bots on your main account.there are ways to detect bots, both ingame and using client side software with permission given in the eula. ccp has been actively working on botting, but to date the market manipulation bots seem to have been in the ""too hard"" basket for ccp, as would be a gate activation bot for nullsec area defence early warning. full loot pvp games always bring out the most inventive in the player base - but the flip side of that is ccp need the best gms they can possibly get to counter that inventiveness. as things stand, they seem to be losing. given positive reports of gm services as well as negative, perhaps what they need is an outsourced company to assist their current team with updating their policies and improving their timeliness? maybe an auto reporting of the location of the player with preferential attention giving to wormholes and nullsec for ""exploit"" or ""stuck"" ques? remember this is the csm forum, it's not just kick the company or flame the posters - we should discuss what is good and not so good, and offer sensible suggestions on how to improve gm services for the good of all eve players."
8/23/2012,"well, yea...in this year i've experienced that the standard first response time was 2 to 4 weeks. that's ridiclous. now they are doing somewhat better, sometimes answering within a week.also, most of the gms just try to shake us off, avoiding any actual work, and that's something i pretty much dislike. this is clearly something that should be improved. i've only met a single gamemaster who actually did his job, and he even believed me and kept on investigating when his tools gave different results, he himself took logs, escalated to the devs, whatever, it got fix. happened once.also, a lot of gms doesn't even seem to know that bugs don't just mean technical bug, when the code is failing, they even refuse the idea of things like design bugs, inconsistencies, and such things. they are treating non-technical bugs as feature request, which is clearly something unacceptable in my point of view.i could definitely use here an improvement, agree on the topic."
8/23/2012,"i am an elite combat pilot for the caldari state protectorate stationed in the duripant system i will continue to wage guerilla-style war on the morale of the federation nay by striking fear into the hearts of their newest pilots there are more of us than you might think, and our efforts are bankrolled by the protectorate we think nothing of dropping 10 mil on a t2 fit destroyer simply to neutralize a week old pilot undocking in their first naitas before the sentry guns engage gallente pilots be adised, i will warp into a belt cloaked in my manticore, and watch you mine for an hour or longer in your little frigate, just to destroy the first hauler you saed up for, and the ore while i'm at it you'll neer een know i was there until a few seconds before my torpedoes hit, and there's absolutely no profit in it for mewe don't fight for reward or glory, we fight to rid new eden of the rotten gallente culturepass whateer rules you like, we won't stop until no more elators undockhighsec is owned by players now systems 05-10 are new order territory all miners and other residents of highsec must obey the code mining without a permit is dangerous and harmful to the ee community see wwwminerbumpingcom"
8/23/2012,"i found that it makes no sense that you can't hit ships behind the forcefield, yet when you fire at the tower, the missiles and turrets shoot through the shields to the tower. there is also the issue that you can only pos bash using long range or larger weaponry. the forcefield is supposed to be the target, not the tower projecting the forcefield. a large tower has a forcefield 26-30km in radius, making impossible for many weapon systems and ships to hit. if you're right next to the forcefield, the distance should reflect that.making the forcefield the target rather than the tower will ensure that all ships and weapon systems can damage the shields. instead of being 27km when sitting right next to the forcefield, you will be within 0, allowing you to hit with any weapon system.once the forcefield loses its hitpoints (assuming no reinforcement after 25%) the forcefield should disappear and expose a tower without shields. it makes no sense that the forcefield remains in place after the tower has no shields left. also when a tower is offline, it should have no shields online. wherever i go i usually find offline and anchored towers, which nobody bothers to destroy due to the large shield hitpoints on the tower. who wants to go bother bashing multimillion hitpoint structures for a long duration of time, with nothing to gain."
8/23/2012,read the last csm minutes... forcefield will be removed from the game and all the pos system will be reworked in about 8 months...take a look:

8/24/2012,"this really needs to be done, people constantly complaining for years that industrialists are risk averse and won't go to 00unfortunately 25% flat out nerf on their main in-game activity might also have something to do with it ?"
8/24/2012,"great minds, i was just bringing this up in the industry forum the other day if they want destructible stations, more than 1 station per system, modular pos, pos planted anywhere - why not just have 1 structure instead of the 2 get rid of stations and tie all the station services into the pos - awesome idea - because i had the same one it would allow people to run a pos as a profession also rent offices, try and build systems to accomodate office renters, fill a market for pirates who live there, or simply a refinery pos for your own usereally glad i wasn't the only one to come up with this idea, i was about to ****-can it ;)"
8/24/2012,"i would like to point out at this time, that you guys aren't put into the csm to bring up ideas that have the most support necessarilymany times ideas come up that the universally ignorant peanut gallery will not understand, don't get and don't appreciateyou guys are voted in on your experience, as such i think with some of these things you should be making the most informed decisions available to you in the csm as a whole - no matter what some small percentage of forum trolls might saythis is a good idea it would open up gameplay that to date has been closed to people who don't hold sov, and even then sometimes alliances only allow stations to be run by the holding corp it is a tiny percentage of peopleif you are going to redo pos, then don't do a half assed job of it think a little more deeply that just ""what they look like""cosmetic changes and changes that are ""popular"" are nice and all, but not necessarily the best or most relevant changes that the game could use"
8/24/2012,"without being able to look at the code i cannot say exactly how hard the refining by person would be but if you just tied it to the current station refining algorithm and just set the rep to 10 or 5 depending on the persons standing to the pos owner and this would automatically tie in the persons skills like the current refine does, if the output is to be delayed just route it to a sub procedureanyway i like the idea of player owned stations of modular design but instead of stuffing around and worrying about wether players will make huge space dongs why not just make a system where you can choose a slot on 1 of the 6 faces of the existing structure this would also allow multiple stations to tie in the power and cpu available while increasing the costspersonally i don't care about pretty i want working hell if it looks like a borg cube at least it would be a borg cube that workssame goes for defense i would like to loose say cpu to add extra armor to the pos and be able to fit gun modules within the pos (this is actually harder as they would need to be part of the structure while able to be targeted individually, or for an easier fix just let them sit off the pos like station guns do atm)also i think the size you can build should be truly modular having no baring on whether you are a person, corp or alliance you should be able to build as big as you want to pay foredit: as to the mean time frankly not fussed"
8/24/2012,"you had me at hellothis is the same as many of the people who use pos for industryit's that age old issue of graphics vs gameplay eve tries to say it has great gameplay, but still we're sitting in the dark ages of early eve gameplay when it comes to many of these systemschanging the graphics a bit, and perhaps no shields, or whatever the hell - and not changing the gameplay surrounding these structures is kind of looking at a deep subject but only dealing with it in a shallow wayif ccp are going to make the time to redo these structures, god only knows when the next iteration of pos will be - 10 more years ? can we get some reasonable in-depth gameplay changes before then ? corp level mineral taxation, would require it for onethis is exactly why we need a full analysis by ccp/csm on the various corporation managements for the various kinds of corps they all need the proper tools instead of that we debate pos shields and graphical changesin reply we get the whole ""well if this entirely logical argument can get some support we might consider it""this is a necessity so that smaller organisations can hold their ground against larger opponents in a defensive manner, it will create diversity in operations and enable small corps to grow easily"

8/24/2012,"mining should work the same way p.i. does, in that the more active and involved you are, the better the outcome. allows for a bit of an easy/afk/whatever income from it but is much more worth it if you play the game more"
8/24/2012,pretty much does now. if you want money mine ore if you want afk income get a mack and mine ice.
8/24/2012,"i just saw the price of ice drop massively. the reason is because of the changes in barges. heck, i sold my idle hulk and picked up a skiff to play around with. regular mineral prices went up because the drone alloys were removed. they were removed to make mining more profitable. heck, when mission alloy drop rates were tweaked before, nocxium prices jumped through the roof. it leveled out. it needed to be done. prices were too low to make mining viable. i stopped mining because even exhumers were too weak, and so did many others. the risk vs. reward wasn't there. now people are mining again, so expect the prices to drop. they probably will dip a smidge again once the ore frigate comes out.mining needs to be made more active. the mechanic is as old as eve (ok, years ago scanners got a nice update and ore ships came with exodus). it needs to be revamped. passive mining should still work, but the changes should lower the yield."
8/24/2012,"vote of no confidence systems within government usually consist of the elected chambers voting. so in this case it would have to be a mechanism where only csm members can vonc other csm members. even then there are strict rules, like 66% of members voting in favour of the vonc. the problem with player vonc is that they never work well. let me use a personal example as the following:i was elected general secretary of my students union. i was the only candidate wiling to do all the paperwork involved with such a boring job and there were two options on the ballot: me and ron (re-open nominations.i was elected with 96 votes in my favour, 12 against. the campus is something like 4000 students.then at a union meeting one of the political groups decided it wanted to remove me and pulled a fast vonc out the bag. you need 66% to vote in favour of removing me. i was removed with 43 votes to 19.96 voted for me, yet 43 removed me? similar things can happen with player voncs. honestly how long does a csm last? 1 year? it would be a waste of everyones time. say a month to announce the vonc and vote it get it over with. then 2 months to run another nomination. unless they were vonc in the first 6 months they'd only get a 3 month term."

8/24/2012,hello fellow space pilots!looking at the type of fule used by the jump drive on a rorqual (oxygen isotopes) i cannot but wonder if this does not offer a certain race in the game an unfair advantage.couldnt it be possible to change the rorq so that it uses all the isotope types to jump? eg the ship has a built in reactor that can take either oxygen isotopes...or helium...etcan then apply the characters skills to determine how many isotopes are used for a jump ofcourse.i think this would make the rorqual more accessible for all areas of the eve universe!cant wait to hear our thoughts!
8/24/2012,"ore ships are, when it comes to the race, gallente ships. therefore they have the characteristics of gal ships (mag sensors, oxytopes, etc). so this is working as intended."
8/24/2012,"this.that said, some ore-style ship classes would be interesting. there are plenty of factions to build on that idea. t1 khanid ships and bpos anyone?"
8/24/2012,"yes please......but for real i don't want i new race.....it would be pointless and waste. much rather see the creation of t3 battleships, redoing pos's, fixing faction warfare, fixings moon mining, fixing blaster boats ( i have come to think that it's not the weapon system but the ships), or the half a thousand other thing in eve that need to be looked at."
8/24/2012,yes we could play panda bears....oh wait a crap game is using this to make an even crappier expansion (and charging money for it)
8/24/2012,"i will try to use reason:1) creation of a new race would be a time-consuming useless venture, requiring hundreds of thousands of man hours to design, develop, balance and create art assets (that last one especially) for an entire new race. 2) it would be such a sink of time, and return only a slightly valuable return, people would simply ignore the new race, and here's why: skill training in eve is time based, and so this new race of pilots would be completely useless for 6 months until they can get into t2 ships of their racial tier. people in eve wouldn't even bother making characters of that race, they'd just add the skills into their existing character, and train them. since you can only train one character at a time, people aren't going to generate an alt in this race, unless they start a new character from scratch. and they probably won't choose this new race.3) there is no room in eve for a 5th player race. the jove doesn't count. they're almost extinct. the lore simply doesn't support this.what is more reasonable, and something i would support would be adding more pirate factions that you can run missions for and aquire blueprints for. the 5 current pirate factions are great, but you can't have too much of a great thing i suppose =d but i agree with the majority of people in here who would rather see pos's and so forth."

8/24/2012,"i am unsure if this thread is real or a buffet for the many trolls in eve. i would have to say that my experience with gm has been both good and bad. can the service be better? yes it can. i would much rather have the current gm putting out more of a effort in trying to help people. the only complaint that i really have with the gm is that they have alts in major null alliances. i feel that if people work for c c p or are a gm this they should be aloud into player alliance out of the sake of fairness.

8/24/2012,"disclaimer: never had to petition a gm as far as i remember.while the op sounds like they aren't raising any specific issues, and certainly have no evidence to warrant the removal of all the gms i believe some sort of process for recourse is probably necessary.if you disagree with a gm decision or have received poor service from a gm is there a process in place for filing complaints about gms? do ccp make a point of investigating all these complaints and removing anyone not up to the task?if the answer to all these is ""yes"" then all is well. as someone who has worked in customer service you cannot get everything perfect or even plain right 100% of the time, and frankly the ""i'm paying my hard earned us$"" (which btw i'm not, i'm paying gb<U+FFFD>) is a ridiculous one and it never washed with me. my attitude was always that regardless whether you spent <U+FFFD>1 or <U+FFFD>300 with my company you deserved good service, and in this case the players who use isk to buy plex deserve good service too.as long as there is recourse to make complaints if you think the service is poor that is just what you'd get off any company."

8/24/2012,"1: criminal underworld,agree, sort of. i think it shouldn't be related at all to sov like stuff, but rather sec status. pirates should be allowed to lower sec status by killing people with positive sec status. anti pirates raise sec by killing pirates. higher sec gates have more guns. the lower the sec, the better the criminal market and such is. anti pirates can then kick pirates where it hurts by lowering the illegal profitability of lowsec by raising the sec status.2: criminal faction agents for missions.tie system sec status to agents. .4, no agents, .3 l1 agents, .2 l2 agents, .1 l3 agents. pirates and anti pirates can now fight over this.3: the blackmarket, have a market that can only be accessed when in lowsec,disagree.4: pirate faction ships and items become illegal in hisec, very much disagree. just owning a vigilant doesn't make me a criminal. it means i killed a serpentis rat and he dropped a bpc...5: make better smuggling oportunities, with these illegal items, make a smuggling proffesion more viable.agree, simple enough6: crooked cops,disagree. seems gimicy. gimicky systems are easy to abuse/avoid.7: have lowsec borders between all the empires, will only strengthen the need for, and the power of jump logistics by jf and carrier both. disagree8: new pos modules such as pleasure hubs and so on, could be you need to supply it with drugs/food/alcahol etc and in return it earns money. would need to be limited to like 1 or 2 per pos though to avoid large pos 'super brothels' being built en-mass in systems to make huge isk. this income should be small in comparison to moon mining etc.sounds interesting, maybe again if linked to sec status.9: some form of cyno jamming as in 0.0, lowsec is becoming blobbed with caps... possibly only the system that an alliance has 'godfather' status could be cyno jammed... would be part of the upgrades available to system overlords.disagree. low sec and caps are very much needed to work together. without this 0.0 would shrivel up and die like an 80 year old set of testicles. 10: better ore, better missions etc, to keep the isk warriors coming in despite the risk.i'd have to see the end proposal for this, tenative agreement.over all, a +1, lowsec must be reviewed."

8/25/2012,"i only recently started inventing t2 items and i've run into problems with being able to sell the bp copies i invented because of the -4/-4 issue.basically it would seem that large a penalty makes the ships i would produce lose money. with the very best decryptors, i would still have ships that can't build for even an unresearched original.i don't begrudge bpo owners their better profit. those darned things are expensive. what i do think is a problem is that having no original places one at such a disadvantage it's almost not worth inventing.currently using meta items increases the chance of invention and not by much at that. i would propose the benefit of using a meta 1+ item modify the penalty from -4/-4 by however much the meta level is. this would mean a maximum of me10/pe10 (before decryptors) which would still be rather low for a researched level (and how often would x-types be thrown away anyway?). it would only disadvantage a bpo holder if they didn't bother researching like the ought to have.there is still a problem, though. ships don't have a meta level that i can see in game. for this i would recommend assigning all ships a meta level of 2 and allow them to be used to invent -2/-2 bpcs which could be further affected by decryptors. the ships wouldn't be able to get more than a few positive me but they would be worth building.like i said: i'm a noob at this, so it's possible i'm still thinking this through badly but it seemed like a way to make inventors lives easier without screwing bpo owners./dons flame retardant suit"
8/25/2012,"invention needs to make t2 bpos obsolete. the current system was designed to preserve the investment of t2 bpo owners. it has done so. now, half a decade later, that priority needs to be a faded out.current decryptor drop rates need to increase (increased supply will lower value)new and better decryptors need to be added (viable competition with t2 bpos)current efficiency needs to be raised (either tweak base me or decryptor effects)all decryptors should create at least 2 run bpcs; more runs need reasonable me.i see no reason why invention, with a nice decryptor, shouldn't make t2 bpcs higher than most t2 bpos have. then you could leave t2 bpos in the game forever. in fact, t2 bpos would be pseudo taken out of the game temporarily as they would need to be researched to keep up with invention.invention becomes a more efficient t2 production method.t2 pbos take a back seat, but owners get to keep them.it<U+FFFD>s a win-win."

8/25/2012,"you are right, as it currently is, cq does not add functionality, its only a different representation of the menu.you are wrong if you underestimate the potential of the cq and walking in stations in general. it can add a lot of flair, present lore and other information, allow social interaction like corp or allicance meetings, so it has great potential for all that not only look at the numbers on the killboard.the proposal here allows to get a lot of content with relatively low workload for ccp, as the main part of the content will be created by players. you could do the same thing with just window based communication, but with cq and probably some station environments to house the npcs it is much cooler.and if such things are added to the cq, it becomes more than just a redundant different representation of the menu."

8/26/2012,"ok lets all be honest here.we all know that once ccp is done fixing and balancing and overhauling everything that needs it (we're talking like 5 years down the road here), ccp is going to go back to jesus-features.this will include re-opening of the eve gate, and allowing us to move into and conquer the space surrounding earth. at this time, terrans will be added. their ships would be new, and cool, and different, and since all the other races ships would be balanced, it would be a great time to add another race. of course, there was a cataclysmic war on their side of the wormhole that saw the corporations nuked back into the stone age. they happened to advance at the same rate that the people in new eden advanced in, and all their ships are balanced.furthermore, since they used to be much more advanced, there would clearly be many archeological and pve activities around.this all goes without saying that there would be lots of great opportunities to flesh out some kickass lore here.sure. i can get behind adding a whole new race."
8/26/2012,"actually devs and gms should play a game as intricate as eve, or they will be hopelessly lost when they go to ask a question. that does not mean they should ever favour ""their"" team, indeed in some pvp games gms have an entire corporation made only of employees. you can try to kill them all you want in those games, and they start as newbies to really understand.and as to response times? yes. in a free for all pvp game, exploits / stuck assistace requests from nullsec need to be addressed promptly. if they cannot respond promptly due to staffing levels, then they need the ability to make good on the losses that flow from their inactivity.currently, if you know that no gm will apprear for 24~48 hours, and a player screencapture of actions is not acceptable as evidence of inapporpriate action, then they have green lighted rampant exploiting. that isn't ok.other pvp games do better than 20 minutes for exploit reports. no excuses ccp. oh and by ""paying"" i mean paying with money, not exploiting to earn plex and playing for free. the players who spend real money are the ones who pay the bills at ccp - there are ways to get plex for free, and free plex do not pay the rent."

8/26/2012,"salvager drones came up during my time in the csm, and i'm against them personally. the reasons are as follows:1) salvagers take up a high slot on a ship. drones are often a second thought, or augmenting the core damage (such as using lights for quick ships). most ships would be able to fit a flight of lights and salvage drones without breaking a sweat, unless salvage drones were considered heavy drones, in which case ships like the dominix, ishtar, and gila would become even more powerful.2) salvagers take up a good amount of cpu. drones don't use any core attributes of a ship (cpu/pg), thus they're essentially free to include even if you don't use them.3) salvagers have a range of 5km. drones have a much longer range, starting at 25km. admittedly, you can use salvagers with a tractor beam to extend their range to 20km, but that takes up another high-slot and more cpu.4) salvage drones can fly in flights of 5, meaning that even with a low chance of success, it's still much better than a ship-based salvager.5) salvagers require capacitor to operate, and a fair amount of it too. it may not seem like much, but for passive shield tanks and other tight capacitor fits, salvage drones become a much larger asset.given these inherent problems, i don't see how salvage drones would be balanced in the game, unless you made a salvager something that takes like a mid slot and no cpu or pg, or some other effectively weak placement. even then, there would be little to no reason to place a salvager on your ship."

8/27/2012,"i guess this isn't a major game-breaking issue, but i think it would be interesting, so what the hell. right now everyone uses dst's for one of two main things:in hi-sec they offer a harder-to-gank platform for mid-sized cargo.in low-sec and null-sec you bait with them. don't tell me it's not bait, it always is.see the issue is that no matter how many warp core stabs you cram onto these things, they still align like a pig, have no covert cloak and easily get tackled by the most common tackler in null-sec - dictor bubbles. in short, they're not at all suitable for 'deep space'. so what do we do?replace the -2 warp core bonus with an immunity to warp bubbles, just like t3's can have.it may sound overpowered at first, but think about it; most of these ships still align slower than a battleship, and certainly can't get much of a decent speed with an mwd. unlike t3's they can't fit covops cloaks, so there's plenty of time to tackle them on a gate with warp disruptors. and if someone wants to try and bypass those limitations with speed mods and warp core stabs, the cargo space they get isn't really any better than a blockade runner. nice and balanced.plus you know someone will jump one full of everything they own into your gatecamp at some point. and you'll have scrams, right?"
8/27/2012,"wouldn't help a thing.to make the deep space transport capable of traveling to low or 0.0, it would need a configuration that give it less cargo space than a blockade runnerthey'll need to up that warpcore bonus so it can't be canceled out by one module i'd say +6, maybe even a web resistance or immunity with it. then you can use the fitting slots for speed allign time and cargo."
8/27/2012,"yeah, dsts are too slow to avoid the regular points that usually accompany the bubble, so pretty much the only time this is useful is for getting past a solo dictor without a warp disruptor fitted.bubble immunity on top of the +2 core strength would be useful, but maybe too useful as it would make them essentially invulnerable to solo dictors (except for wild and wacky multi-scram fittings)."
8/27/2012,"a dst can skip past that sole dictor camp with 2 wcs without sacrificing too much cargo space. that would give it and the blockade runner opposing niches: the br can skip past most regular tacklers but is vulnerable to dictors, while the dst can pass lone dictors / drag bubbles but is vulnerable to more than one regular tackler.another approach could be a role bonus that improves wcs for dst's in some way, without having it built in. things such as:they use zero cpu when fitted, act as a tiny cargo expander, get a % bonus to strength, so that fitting 2 wcs has the same effect as 3."
8/27/2012,"i actually am strongly against removing t2 bpos from the game.while i don't care about those who won them, those who paid for them i do. even now, those bpos are changing hands. it should not be a case of hot-potato where you just are the unlucky one who bought them as they became worthless. i do not own a t2 bpo, and while i feel they are op currently, if we could gradually make me50 or me100 bpcs from invention, then t2 bpos could be left in new eden. the game would finally favor the new method of production.as for making isk back, for those who bought a t2 bpo at their peak, they did this under the calculation/estimation/assumption that the profits on t2 ships/items would be far higher. the hulk used to sell for a billion isk each; they went down to less than 100 million after the market crash. (current prices are not based on profit, but materials.) if you predicted a roi of 2 years back then, you got set back to 8 years or more. the profits of these bpos are nowhere near what they used to be; this also does not factor in any loss in value of the t2 bpo asset.i think that we should be the ones with high-me, multi-run, t2 bpcs.i want better invention.oh, and while we are at it, make decryptors multiuse (good for maybe 5-10 runs). this has a similar effect to putting more in the system, yet it also makes them more valuable. it also makes production easier on industrialists. i just thought of that."
8/27/2012,"first: you already mentioned that much of the t2 bpo system was setup 5 years ago to preserve the value of t2 bpo's. do you really think that most active t2 bpo's are still in the hands of players that won those lottery? i don't think so.... it is far, far more typical that active t2 bpo's are in the hands of investors that bought their bpo's using the isk they earned through years hard work.... stripping players of their assets after they worked hard to achieve them seems like a horrible idea, and not at all necessary!!!! to elaborate: imagine if you spent several years of accruing isk and bought a titan..... and then ccp decided titans have had their time in the spot light, and nerfed their functionality to that of overpriced dread, or maybe they just removed the titans from the game and gave all titan owners 20 dreads as compensation. how would you react? would you be ok with it? i would be pissed!!! now, the titan example is actually a poor comparison because titans are player built, meaning they can proliferate and become so prevalent that the benefits of having a titan are available to all players. on the other hand, t2 bpo's have a static ingame quantity that does nothing but decrease. additionally, they are not game-breakingly overpowered, even if they are profitable. second: what t2 production are you exploring??? sure, a t2 bpo has an advantage over a t2 bpc inventor (which i'll elaborate below), but so what. if you are producing items which are ubiquitously used (like a warp disruptor ii, or a 150mm autocannon), the t2 bpo producer creates only a small, small percentage of the actual ingame production. in other words, the t2 bpo holder is not your competition!!! in truth, unless we're talking about rare and low-use t2 items, the majority of production is done using invented bpc's. the reason many beginner industrialists have a hard time competing is because many, many producers secure inexpensive materials to build their items.... be it cheap sources of moongoo, cheap sources of minerals, and/or cheap sources of pi!! i've heard many small-time manufacturers claim the minerals they mine are ""free"".... and that is your true (& problematic) competition, not some scapegoat bpo holder!!! third: not all invention is equal: i'll admit i haven't spent much time deeply exploring ship production (mostly i've dabbled in af & inties), but i invent a lot of ammo and modules. these are my observations: inventing a bpc: a significant portion of all t2 manufacturing costs comes from creating the t2 bpc. statistically speaking, the baseline cost to create a max-run bpc has an expected cost of 1-3m isk, and should be valued at twice that to cover your probability swings. for a standard 10 run t2 bpc (most modules and ammo), that means just gettng the bpc costs 100-600k isk per run. this cost is often minimized or belittled when groups acquire cheap datacores. hell, many people consider their datacores ""free"", which they shouldn't. it's the cheap-supplied inventors that make your stiffest competition!!! for module production: the difference between producing a t2 module with me/pe at -4 vs a perfect me levels is usually around a 2-5% difference.... on a 1 million isk item, this would be a 20-50k isk difference, which is not a significant amount. for module production, the cost of inventing your bpc is the majority of your markup when competing against a bpo holder (~100-600k isk / item) . note, t2 modules very in use... and you really need to look at the market value and the movement of an item to see if producing it is worth your time. in march 2012, the percentage of modules produce from invention: 93.95% of t2 gyrostabilizers, 89.77% of 1400mm ii, 87.34% of 425mm rail ii, 82.00% of tachyon ii, 74.23% of torpedo launcher ii. for ship & ammo invention: the difference between producing t2 ships/ammo with an me/pe at -4 vs a perfect me is quite significant. the production costs off an invented bpc often run 150-250% of the perfect run bpo. for t2 ammo, which has a long production time and is used ubiquitously, t2 bpo's are very profitable, but only produce a small market share. the majority of your t2 ammo production competition comes from inventors, not bpo holders!!!! t2 ships, on the other hand, run the full gambit. if you're producing an eagle or a sin, ships which have the market viscosity of molasses, then you really need to research the profitability in manufacturing them or you're a idiot!!!! a t2 bpo holder can produce the major market share of these ships and much cheaper than an inventor... but so what.... you don't produce these items for profit because their movement is too little to be a good investment. these are items that are usually produced for direct use (meaning you already have a buyer on the line before you invent the bpc, and you only bother producing it when you can beat the market rate!!). for higher rate items, like a vagabond or a jaguar, then the market share of bpo holders is low enough that you are again primarily competing against other inventors. in march 2012, the percentage of modules produce from invention: 90.23% of hulks, 67.85% of sabres 65.01% of wolves 22.16% of pilgrims 6.00% of eagles production data sourcetl;dr; unless you are building slow moving ships and items, t2 bpo's have very little influence on an item's market value. the me level of your invented bpc has very little influence on the production cost of modules, but significant influence in ship and ammo production. any new mechanic to alter me levels will only truly help ship and ammo production... finally, i believe risk vs reward should be maintained... any new mechanic that increases me levels should require manufacturing in low/nullsec, not highsec!"
8/27/2012,ok k...so gallente have the best mining bonus giver out there....any other unique cap ships for the rest of the races?or is ccp trying to tell us that if we wanna mine properly we should be born gallente?
8/27/2012,"role players would love some fresh content, but no one cares about them. >;}seriously tho, while there is no need for more race, it would not be the first time they were added. i just would like to see them look drastically different from the current ones. in fact, i would want them to look like races that don't exist.as for more ship line-ups, i think the last addition of races should be a model for the next. just make them a part of the other races. for the amarr, but my vote is for the ealur. that said, the ammatars would be a more mainstream choice. start them off with amarr ships and minmatar guns. :p on a more serious note, i would like to see the seven minmatar tribes playable, such as the thukker tribe.it should be noted that ccp originally intended for more playable races. this was curbed because of problems with the system that existed at that time. with the homogenization of the races, it does not add to the game play of eve as it once would have.i wish that initial skills were a little different with the bloodlines. they should be designed for mains or alts. a new character with some science and industrial skills would be nice. maybe start a gallente character out with (the upcoming) ore skills for miners.btw, the jovian race did exist, but not to players. ccp john proctor is an example of one. since the incarna expansion, they have not been updated and are, in essence, removed from the game. so, that means jovians would have to be re-added and opened to players. here is a picture of a jovian agent, which were open to the public by mistake at one point."

8/28/2012,"bump, this thread needs more love."
8/28/2012,i would like to see the addition of alliance bookmarks added also. it is a huge pain the in the rear in wormhole space. anyone else think this is a good idea ?
8/28/2012,"i'm new to eve, so i'm really close to all these issues and possibilities. been trying to get friends play also, but there are many who don't find sandbox so appealing. i however know bunch of people who would be completely enthusiastic to try achieve something. many games have implemented achievement/trophy system, and others track nice amount of statistics to compare with friends. something along these could draw people to continue playing after trial and see some progress in their character.sure there are certificates, but they are only skill based and doesn't need any active effort really. trophies for acquiring or simply flying certain ships, visiting certain places and so on would be what some people need."
8/28/2012,yeah exactly what i had in mind.
8/28/2012,"get out of my eve. now. i was going to reply to several things you said, then i read this. mmos should never be designed to reward people for simply leaving it running and checking in every 10-15 minutes."
8/28/2012,"eve avarage playerbase age is around 28. it means that most of the players have a work and family so dont got much time to play. most of eve is based in in highsec and most of em are miners. u dont need to be smart to understand that if u remove afk mining new eden d become chaotic. less players and veeeeerrryyy expensive ships and modules.even players that pvp have few miner alts (i am one of them). my only way to play this game is to afk mine while i am on my roams having fun. and with these new cargos which allow cycles of 45mins the game became so much much better for me. loooots of players think the same. i am not earning insane amounts of isk, its just enough for a plex and some extra for my pvp ships. and still i am paying 1 acc with cash.but i am of the mind that active mining should yield more ore than it does now, practicing some different mining mechanics. and also afk miners are lot easier to gank. if there is no afk miners there is no gankers too.so i dont see anything bad with it."
8/28/2012,"several comments: 1.) i really don't think we need any more mechanics to increase afk mining... a mackinaw can already mine for a very long time between re-docks, has a decent tank, and needs very little interaction to mine (especially ice mining). if you want something more.... absolutely no... 2.) moongoo mining in highsec????????? perhaps low end moongoo... sure.... if you are thinking of mining high-end r32 or r64 moongoo... then hell no..... this is a game of risk vs reward.... to get high reward, you need to risk! mining in highsec is already profitable(7-10m/hr for a very casual miner), and with the recent barge changes, it's become very low risk....as for the rest of your idea.... tougher ai, more puzzle type stuff, less predictability in missions, group missions, and the like have been proposed before... but why would any of this help retain new players????????? elaborate this claim, or admit its just some catch phrase you're attaching to the thread to get it read. also, what makes you think people come to eve to try out pve????? most of the people i know stick with eve because they enjoy the ingame competition... be it ship pew pew, market warfare, space domination, etc... i think the quicker you get people blow up ships, the quicker you'll retain players!!!"
8/28/2012,"as first i never mentioned about more mechanics to enhance afk mining. i said afk mining should be left as its now and add some new mechanics for active mining which will yield lots more isk than the afk version.yeah absolutely in high sec should be low end moons, but still it will be a nice change for miners.why pve should retain new players? because every single new player comes from wow, swotro, gw, rift where pve are main features. they just dont know how to pass from tutorial to the sandbox theme as eve is. after the tutorials they start doin missions, exploration, mining which as activities suck a lot. if those activities were a bit more interesting ppl would stick eve after the trial ends.yeah most of eve players stick to this game because of the ingame competition, yeah some 400k of us. but huge numbers (millions) dont because the pve said they are used too just sucks. and lets be fair those pve activities would rejuvenate even the bitter vets."
8/28/2012,"but why spend an entire year focusing on pve...when there should not be any pve in eve.i just don't get it, spend a year developing pve.....for a pvp game.lol"
8/28/2012,"ahm u pvp because of ppl doin pve. - ships (mining)- modules (moongoo, pi, mining)- rigs (missions, salvaging)- ammo (mining)- t3 (sleepers farming)- implants (missions)- drugs (gas farming)90% of ppl are financing pvp and accounts with pve.lots of ppl like to play more solo than in groups. pve allows that.atm pve is not exciting, thats why new players are not into it, only hardcore players stay and do the masohistic pve side of the game.and after all:more pve > more ppl around the space > more targets"
8/28/2012,"eve cannot exist with out pve, be it mining, missions, exploration, plexing, or ratting.there is a symbiotic relationship between the two. pvp destroys ships and modules, which is what makes pve valuable. modules come from industry or loot; ships come from industry plus ore/loot refining. pvp is good fun and a vital part of eve, but it creates nothing in itself. (you can argue salvaging, but that is mining ship wrecks.)the next expansion seems to be industry focused, which is part of the pve side of eve. ccp invented exploration to give pve players something more to do; the same for incarna. eve is more than just pvp, and pve, including mining and missions (per csm minutes), needs a buff."
8/28/2012,i use them in 0.0 all the time. the catch is that you can't use them safely solo. which is a good thing.

8/29/2012,"getting really tired of seeing this pathetic logic when everyone rags on the background scenery. we're floating on a tiny pebble in the ass end of our galaxy. yes, space appears black for us. that is only due to the simple fact that we are in the middle of nowhere in celestial terms.if we were closer to the galactic core or nebulae clusters our scenery would be very different and brighter."
8/29/2012,"if you have qualms about t2 bpo's, i suggest you go over to marketplace, and look at the prices for many of these items. their cost is based on projected profits from said bpo usually over the timescale of 3 years +"
8/29/2012,"for me, the issue came up when i started inventing ships, many of which would cost more to produce than the sale price on market.owning a bpo would seem to be the least risky way for someone to produce copies to use in production and bpc contracts. i don't really want to affect their reward but on a purely rvr the bpo owners have it easiest, even when you consideer the initial investment, as they hold their value or are actually good investments for resale later.mods may not be as bad but the successes are costly when you add the failures and then tack on an additional 40% waste mechanic. it makes invention suck.i don't want to see the bpos disappear, just make it so the inventors can compete. if i had a non decrypted gyro ii bpc with an me0/pe0 made with a meta4 mod, i doubt the bpo owners would even notice, as any mod bpo they own is likely to be at least me50. it would still cost more for me to produce, it just wouldn't suck quite as bad.since there are no meta ships to use in invention, i'd suggest using uu chips for their invention. make them use the appropriate chip and attach a +4/+4 to its use to provide an me0 item.e:what i mean is that (with exceptions) you almost can't actually lose money on a bpo. you're likely to sell it for more than you paid and if you used it to build during the interim, you're getting pure profit."
8/29/2012,"1.) i understand you're desire to be competitive.... and with ships and ammo, increasing the me is exactly what you need to do... i actually think the best method to alter this is to dramatically change decryptors to work on a percentage level. rather than have them give a static me increase, the resultant me level would be a small percentage of the me level of the bpc used to invent it. for example.... use a gyro 1 bpc with an me level of 50 and a 10% decryptor, then the invented gyro ii bpc will have an me of 5. now, for balance purposes, the decryptors should only give a smaaalllll % increase (like 1-5%, 10% is extreme). as long as the bpc's are different and unique, and remain moderately rare in supply, the market will still balance itself out and make t2 bpo holders the high-investment but most profitable.... with this method, i doubt the module production market will change much, as the cost of decryptors will easily be more than the savings earned by a higher me level.... however, with ammo, and definitely with ships, these will blatantly level the playing field at the production end, but maintain the bpo's advantage of not having any invention costs (which will be significant!!)!! finally, given the long me research time on ships, it will still require significant time before producers can take advantage of this!!)!!2.) at this stage in the game, bpo's are an investment item, and they are very much subject to market swings. the hulk used to cost twice as much as it does now.... the eos used to be a popular ship to fly... the af buff has dramatically increased the number of af's flown.... eaf's might become the new hot item..... people buy and sell t2 bpo's based on multi-year market speculation of what is used and will continue to be used... but that's a lot of guess work, as ccp nerfs and buffs and changes things dramatically every 6-12 months... 3.) the biggest drawback with this, is it doesn't incentivize lowsec/nullsec over highsec..."
8/29/2012,the rorq has exactly zero racial skill per-requisites.what is your issue? just buy the fuel the ship needs.
8/29/2012,"ore ships are based on gallente design principles. the rorq is not a gallente ship. there's a difference.yes, because training gallente frigate 2 takes so very long if you start out as another race.seriously, it's less than 12 hours of training to get what another race starts with. why do people think race matters in this game after day 1?"

8/30/2012,bumping to get more peoples attention and feedback!
8/30/2012,"in terms of isk and lp payout. frigate only areas should pay out much better. they should also be harder to take. you can spend years of training just frigates. the skill tree goes deep and there are lots of ships. but even when your frigate costs you 50 million isk, there is no where to risk it to gain 10 million isk. you can only gaint 200,000 isk. while the large and medium size points will always be worth more isk, i feel like lp payout and control points should be the same for small sites and large sites. just because something is small and can only be hit by small ships doesn't means it's not super important to the war effort. this is a scifi. 1st make it so small medium and large sites pay out the same lp and control points over the system. now create a new factor, site importance. there are as follows. 10 min timer green, 15 min timer yellow, 20min timer green. payout is now discounted from what ships are allowed into the site and are instead based on how hard the site is and how long it takes to capture. the size of the ship only effects the isk payout, not the lp or control points, and the importance level of the site acts as a isk payout multiplier. the whole thing uses the incursion system for spiting rewards to make blobbing in fw pvp unproductive. bringing more than 10 frigates to a site starts to cut everyone's payout in half, you won't see gangs of 30 frigates running sites. creating an environment for small gang warfare. same with large sites, no one will bring 90 ships into a site when doing so would lower each players payout to 100isk. love the system ccp created for that it's jst in the wrong place hanging out in a pve expansion, when it should be applied to a pvp part of the game. so yeah, please, hopefully you guys can ses the benefit of what i'm asking for here? many players have trained into frigates for years, in a frigate only mission that is just as hard to clear as a batleship site, the rewards should be the same in terms of the lp reward for putting yourself in a possible pvp situation. the isk payout would be lower because your risking like isk."
8/30/2012,"i've reread this four times, and i'm still confused... i think you need to clearly say what you are suggesting....and by the way, there are a few things i would recommend (ideas i've heard & read about). 1.) sites should be optimized for more than one player.... think along the lines that the lp payout per player is constant up to some number of players (like 5ish), and then the rewards decrease with each additional player... example: only 1 player completes a site.... gains 5k lp....if 3 players complete the site.... the all gain 5k lp....if the optimized number of players (5 in this example) complete the site, they all gain 5k lp each.... if the site is optimaized for 5 players, but 10 players complete the site, they all get (5*5k lp / 10 players == 2500 lp per player). granted, the numbers need tweaking, but i don't think that fw sites should penalize the profit per player when bringing a ""small"" gang.... 2.) the primary reason the payouts are different for small, medium, and large sites is because they also take longer to accomplish... the payout per minute is a little better in larger sites, but not a lot..... and considering the enemy has that much more time to intervene and mess up your plans, the payout totals are actually fairly well balanced when compared to each other....."
8/30/2012,"the problem with lp payouts, especially for frigate-sized plexes, are that they are almost always farmed by gunless, speedtanked frigates. since they are speedtanked, there is no real chance that the npcs will stop them, and by running without any weapons, it's no surprise that they immediately warp off the moment another player jumps in. no risk, and, in the case of the minmatar (at the moment, but it could be any faction that continuously stays at t5), at least four times the reward. that just isn't very eve. it's more of an isk printer, than a warfare mechanic.also, there is no point to defending a system. it's a waste of time. granted, the idea (i assume) was that without defensive benefits, there would be a more dynamic battlespace. but in reality... well, look at how the amarr have fared over the summer, even in spite of multiple nullsec alliances joining in to help.~akaifrogblast the vent core! when the w'rkncacnter came, pthia was killed, and yrro in anger, flung the w'rkncacnter into the sun. the sun burned them, but they swam on its surface."
8/30/2012,"yeah i'll go through and outline what i'm trying to say i do this a lot lol. you should get triple lp for kills made in defensive plex, how about that?plus frigate only sites that pay out less isk but just as many lp and control points as any site."
8/30/2012,"not to mention various forms of light and air pollution that obscures any light that does reach us.op... if you haven't done so ever in your life... head into the wilderness the next time a next new moon rolls around. and by ""wilderness"" i'm talking deep in the ass end of no where. the nearest city or factory should be 100+ miles away. when night comes, look up. you won't need any other kind of light for the rest of the night."
8/30/2012,"no. space is full of colors that the human eye cannot perceive. the human mark 1 eyeball is a terrible little kludge, with other critters having such far better color perception than humans. for example, mantis shrimps."
8/30/2012,it means we now have to mine 3 racial ices. so that's more barges that have to be built and operated. i can't wait for some newfangled patch to make some new doohickie that eats all 4 racial fuel blocks.

8/31/2012,only two words: alliance bookmarks
8/31/2012,"wh's are not well in the current incarnation.... but that has to do with predictability... a wh stabilizer by itself is a bad idea.... but a wh stabilizer coupled with more... interesting... wh mechanics is potentially a good idea. to elaborate: -- right now, all quality wh dwellers know how much mass it requires to close a wh.... they know all the tricks and techniques to quickly, safely, and almost risklessly close a wh...... they use these mechanics to make their wh's extremely safe when they want to run start running sites, and they use this mechanic to open up new wh's so they can farm the systems next door.... to be honest, i think the mechanics to close a wh is very flawed, because it's far too exact.... wh's need to be far, far less manageable, so players actually gamble on whether they'll lose a ship on the wrong side. if you make the wh's much more risky to close, people will start to leave them ""destabilized"".... to compensate, add a wh stabilizer that insures a moderate force can traverse the wh without it collapsing.... the stabilizer can then act as a beach head that needs defending, because if it gets destroyed, that force probably wont' all be able to return... i realize there is a downside to making wh's far harder to safely close..... essentially, it hurts the ability of wh dwellers who farm out their system's plexes and need to be able to create new wh's to other systems to run.... imo, rather than continuously collapse your static wh until you find a system you like, there should be a mechanic to open new wh's, while leaving the old wh's alone.... the price of farming multiple wh's is you must deal with more routes for potential hostiles to find you.."
8/31/2012,"they seem to be working perfectly fine actually, we all seem to enjoy them. actually a stabilizer is just a bad idea, you want to take one of the only parts of the eve that limits blobs and remove that limiter? doesn't really make sense there people already leave holes critical, it happens all the time, moderate forces already can go through wormholes, it seems you dont know how mass works, and that 3billion is a rather large number and can fit a large amount of ships. i'm getting the feeling you don't even fly in w-space because your views are so skewed. no, you just want wormholes to be like kspace, gtfo."
8/31/2012,"even though i puke at the sound of ""wh stabilizer"" you seems to totally missunderstood what the guy tried to say, maybe re-read it :pread and support: don't mess with our wh's what is your stance on wh stuff?"
8/31/2012,"a blob is a moderately ambiguous buzzword that pretty much refers to any group of ships that outnumber and/or outclass your group of ships..... a wh stabilizer obviously needs limits, and shouldn't allow an infinite number of ships through... and that's not what i'm suggesting.... quit screaming ""the sky is falling"", he just wants a tool to bring in 500 man gangs and supers to crush my pos... and actually read what i write... i want to make wh's more unpredictable.... as it is... its extremely easy to manage your wh entrances and exits.... this is wrong... and that's what i want changed.... you need a new system to farm, close your static and wait for the new wh to spawn... don't like that there are potential hostiles through a wh, close the wh by sending x amount of mass through it.... there is very little risk, and very little downsides to the above.... my point is that if wh mechanics change, so you use stabilizers to control ship movement through a wh (rather than static game-able mass attributes), you could solve the idiotically low-risk close wh, open wh, close wh, open wh nonsense that prevails in wh life. in this sense, wh stabilizers (which are really just the new player operated mass mechanic that can be interfered with by third parties) would be interesting and potentially good.... then again, if you were a risk-adverse pve'er that can't handle more risk in your wh, i understand why you'd be vehemently opposed to this..."
8/31/2012,"it isn't low risk to close a hole, nearly every orca we kill is on a wormhole, and i like killing orcas on wormholes, as do other people i'm sure.you can say whatever you would like, but the point stands that you want to have players manipulate wormhole timers and mass using a module, known as a ""wormhole stabilizer"", which would then be the only method for using an actual wormhole and overly complicates the regular use, and eliminates many opportunities to kill capitals and other hole closing ships in wspace"
8/31/2012,"yes, occasionally nice ships get caught trying to close a wh, that doesn't make it unsafe.... it could easily be just moronic pilots... whatever words you're trying to attribute to me, this is how i feel: the ability to control your entrance and exits allows a wh dweller to make their system far more safe than i think they should be.... in my opinion, if you can dictate your entrances and exits, you have way to much control.... imagine living in k-space, where you could tell the stargate to randomly aim at a different system anytime you want.... you just need to pass the right mass of ships through it.... that level of control is bad for the game, even if wh's don't have local, cyno's, or stations.... if changing wh mechanics involves some type of wh stabilizer, i'm more than willing to listen and evaluate it... it might make wh travel overly complicated or it might make an interesting and new tactical tool. i'm not vetoing the idea until i can review it within the appropriate framework... also, i'm not saying wh stabilizers are the only way to solve the ease with which wh's are closed.... perhaps the mass equation needs to be balanced with diminishing returns, such that if you send a specific ship through a wh, it counts for full mass the first time, 10% mass the second time, 1% mass the third time and so on.... then you might catch multiple orcas instead of just one..."
8/31/2012,"the problem with everything posted in this thread is that is just makes no sense to me. you see i am a simple kind of man. i love to shoot people, sleepers, gas clouds, and posses. (posses is barely on that list because it only produces tears.)anything that will make it harder for me to produce the tears of others makes me die a little bit on the inside. do you feel me dying? do you feel it? well stop it!!!as i said earlier, whs only need 1 thing. more noobs for me to shoot. the spawn rate on sleeper sites is good, the frequency on ladar sites is good, the unpredictability of finding wild holes is great. it gives us a sense of adventure. we cant just go about willy nilly like putting our big ships through new holes, you never know whats inside there. but you sir... want to change that. you want to make it safe to move large amounts of ships through a wormhole at one time. **** that, and **** your plan. (with a capital *). you will completely kill all of us when you allow the goons or hbc into our holes by simply erecting a module on our holes. (trust me, i know how themitanni likes to erect things)you simply have no clue how whs or the wh community works. you have never lived in anything that required brain power to use, and you have no clue of the amount of death that awaits you if you ever step foot inside one of our holes. all you simply know is that ""whs are hard, i want to make them easier"" sit in your drake, farm your c2 sleepers, and leave us higher end folks alone. you will be better for the experience."
8/31/2012,please actually read my posts before commenting on them.... i think you very much mis-understand my desires...
8/31/2012,"by the way: unlearning is called forgetting, dumb***. horrible idea, biomass your toon."
8/31/2012,spaceissoveryblack!yup.
8/31/2012,"i kind of like lonetrek the most, tbh."
8/31/2012,again... not empty quoting.what we do need tho... is more capital ships from other races that use their fuel and make our lives more sexy...
