2/1/2016,"to be honest at this point (considering lack of ccp will for wis in the eve game client) i would be happy with a seperate game built around the unreal engine or something similar that does wis stuff easier. gambing, market trading, some fps style exploration/missions, walking around giant stations and maybe even some ships.as long as tehe the chat channels were linked (like dust) i could spend my time in a cool virtual world while waiting for pings. however...i do think this idea"
2/1/2016,here is the csm watch interview with mr hyde113 (aka mr hyde) for the csm 11 election.enjoy!
2/1/2016,good luck with the campaign mr hyde. i've always enjoyed your videos and i'm sure you'll bring a interesting point of view to the table if you're elected. on the battleship topic i've always liked the idea of ships having rigs or maybe a module for some sort of anti frigate weapons. i guess i'm thinking about how navy carriers have miniguns on them like this. before anyone jumps on me i'm not talking about an insta blap frigate weapon but something balanced to put a battleship into perspective against much smaller ships.
2/1/2016,this  <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B0>
2/1/2016,"so, you have no idea yet what you are actually going to do and to what end, but you are confident that you can whip something up as soon as you are in?"
2/1/2016,"some people might think you're weird and they're right, you can be. but i voted for you last year and also this year, because you are also a smart dedicated player."
2/1/2016,"another reason i won't be voting for you.""i made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter."" ~blaise pascal~"
2/1/2016,your reasons for voting are very petulant.
2/1/2016,"as are yours for running...(`-`)""i made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter."" ~blaise pascal~"
2/1/2016,considering you run a media site and refer to yourself as a journalist i'm really not sure why you're even able to run. no offence and all but it makes no sense.
2/1/2016,had a brief chat with bobmon and i endorse him for csm. good luck mate i will be voting for you
2/1/2016,"yes, i run evenews24.com which is considered to be a 'media website'' however i have always looked at our site differently. in my eyes the work i do for evenews24 is purely a extension of my hobby, eve online. i love to write about things that happen within eve online and i love to manage my team. i'm not working for evenews24 to be this 'journalist'' i'm simply a player who likes to write stories (hence why en24 is registered as a fansite)i do understand the underlying concern that might be out there however i want too i'm already used to dealing with a same type as situations right now as that i might run into as a csm member. i'm a member of pl and the feared #rekkingcrew. both organizations have a ''zero tolerance rule'' which means that you are removed from the alliance if you do anything that is considered leaking. both pl and the rekkingcrew are heavily involved with daily events that happen within eve online and has also resulted in me running into situations were i knew something big but i couldn't write about it. this is not a problem for me, again i'm not here to become this known journalist, i'm purely here to write about stories that interest me and not here to screw over my own fun in the game. an example of this is the time when pl decided to sell brothers of tangra to xix and go back to a nomadic lifestyle. this was a move that would later have a lot of impact, with other alliances doing something similar as pl did. this move was something that pl members, (including myself) were told about, long before it actually happened and still i didn't talk/write about it."
2/1/2016,i passed the test! :) thanks bro!
2/1/2016,"it's not about whether or not you are likely to leak. sion has already been in the csm and since he's not been kicked for leaking it's safe to say that's not why he's been disallowed. the point is that members of gaming media are not allowed to run, one assumes because of the increased risks should a leak occur, so the rule should be applied to all gaming media. en24 isn't a simple blog or fansite, it is a media site, so there's no reason it should be exempt from those rules. ccps acceptance of your campaign reeks of bias and inconsistency in the application of the rules, and your election would only exacerbate that. should you be elected, it would be good form to push for more consistency during these processes going forward, otherwise the integrity of the entire csm is undermined."
2/1/2016,"en24 is not involved with any other games and there for seen as a fansite, this was confirmed by ccp leeloo. there was always a rule which disallowed other gaming company employees from running as csm so i see the rule change only as a smart update as it makes sence to not have other gaming media staff on a team which sees everything that happends internally. feel free to poke me on slack if you want to talk about it even more."
2/1/2016,thank you for the opportunity <3
2/1/2016,a few quick questions to rabble alliances first csm candidate 1 what do you think could make wars more interesting to non predator types and something worth engaging in (obviously some people won't want to fight but i mean more groups like ours of which there are a few)2 villainy is important for without it we can't have hero's . but being a hero doesn't really pay the bills well. what kind of incentives could be offered to players for playing the hero of highsec and killing those evil -10's?3 (troll question) would my 'package' fit into your corp?
2/1/2016,"hello, i'm new in eve and in circle-of-two, but a lot of people say me than he is a great pilote and a good pilote. :)he has my vote.vote the judge for csm."
2/1/2016,"well i've only been in co2 for just over 4 months. and since day 1 the judge has been nothing but helpful. if there is ever anything i need clarified or need more information on the judge has been nothing but helpful. same goes for whenever i have a problem, he has always helped out with that. he has been there since day 1 and i think that is something that is very important for a csm. i'd also like to add that he is the kind of player that leads by example. which is just another one of the judge's many leadership traits. i hope he wins, because after all the hard work he puts into the alliance and it's members, if he applies that to the csm position as i know he will, he deserves to be a csm."
2/1/2016,"i believe csm is a bunch of corrupt sycophants and that the judge will fit right in as he comes from the evilest place on earth, australia. vote the judge to bring back poisonous wildlife to iceland !"
2/1/2016,"i don't like eve in it's current state, i don't like the judge either, but i heard his ideas so i'm going to support him.vote the judge for csm xi!"
2/1/2016,"i endorse tora with all i got. very few commit as much time to others content as this guy and i think that's the kind of guy i want on the csm. the experience with empire space is also invaluable.now for the questions 1.a do you feel it is possible to generate a meaningful experience in the war dec system (past, present or future) to a newbro/newbro corp. if yes...1.b what do you feel would provide a meaningful experience with the wardec system to said newbros that would ideally help with player retention2. do you think emergent content is in a good place at the moment or could it use some help? if yes what do you think needs help?3. (troll question) are my glasses 'cool enough' or do i need a monocle?"
2/1/2016,"thanks...if there are only newbro's, probably not much, but if you mix them with a few more experienced players, then they can do a lot of damage in a war. a thousand bee stings will still kill the lion. biggest problem with bigger fleets is to actually get a fight, but many for example merc alliances have customs offices or posses. start shooting them and you will have a fight. you do need to do your homework first and find them. there should not be an easy here it is option.effort and you shall be victorious !and yes, always have a monocle !"
2/1/2016,this is why i like tora for csm too is because he doesn't panda to would be supporters clearly leading in their questions. +1
2/1/2016,looking much better than last years campaign. good luck.would it be correct to assume your main focus would be on wardec and highsec aggression mechanics?
2/1/2016,"thanks. yes those two, but when you would ask my alt(s), i also would like to be involved with the industry subjects. with a bad industry, you'll have less affordable ships, modules, etc, which will probably give you less good fights. so if you want to pvp and have fun, you also need to have a solid industry base. balance, it's always about good balance....."
2/1/2016,i have removed a couple of posts for the reasons listed above.
2/1/2016,thank the lord! imagine if he pandered to pandas...

2/1/2016,a great and knowledgeable person who will serve the csm well.
2/1/2016,"i am announcing my candidacy for csm xi based on a hisec platform. what makes me different from any other hisec candidate? i am not a carebear, i want to bring together and represent all forms of hisec content. i want to represent the carebear, the miner, the station trader, the newbro, the incursion runner, the relic runner, the ganker, the war target hunter. some of these groups have little to no representation in csm. alot of hisec players are independent and feel no sense of community to those who play differently then them. how many incursion runners out there have stopped playing for a week just because marmites war decd them that week? how many miners run to a station every time a code operative comes into local? how many station traders get mad because someone crashed a market they were in? i see all of this as content, we all need each other. without the miner, code doesnt exist, without the station trader how are prices kept in check? if we do not have content or social interactions, the game dies.i do not represent a block, i am not looking to change the way nullsec, lowsec, or wormholes function or operate. i am here simply because after years of playing i am still blown away that hisec has virtually no sense of community. what makes eve so great is the social aspects and the butterfly effect. every time an incursion runner loses a vindi, some indy guy who builds them makes a sale, some kid who just bought his first t2 bpc gets to sell some t2 blasters, etc etc. as for the vindi pilot, well he learns to appreciate what he has, and now he has a reason to grind even more. maybe he will get a scout alt, or maybe he will start an intel channel and get people involved in it and get everyone more organized so less vindis will be lost. then the ganker in turn will need to become even more dedicated and more organized if he wishes to score that next sweet kill. people are what make eve great, so lets play together. any questions, concerns, suggestions, or anything please send me a mail. +about me, i have done a bit of everything, i have been in nullsec blocs, i have been in fw, i've mined, i've ganked miners, i was a hisec mission runner for a while, i lost an incursion fit vindi to verge of collapse (back when vindis were actually expensive), i started my own corp and know the pains of building something from nothing, and as of late i have been station trading while deciding on what i would like to do next.+"
2/1/2016,"i am a little confused why you say there is no sense of community. clearly there are sometimes even large communities of players that have appeared in highsec. i am referring to incursions communities, hauling and trade channels, ganking and anti-ganking groups, and so forth. do you think there should be a single, unifying community where everyone who lives in highsec should identify with? if so, what form would you envision this to take and how would you go about bringing such a community into existence?i will also take this opportunity to ask some more specific questions. what are you thoughts on the current state of incursions? do you think the current reward is balanced for the amount of effort and risk that they require? and what are your thoughts on the new drifter incursions? do you think they should replace the sansha incursions in highsec, or continue to live along side them?"
2/1/2016,"reserved for amendments. mail me in-game or leave a post with your thoughts.killing your ships and pods since 2008. killboards don't lie, don't get mad, get better."
2/1/2016,"i heard about holey long before starting eve. his stats are immaculate, over 1 trillion in isk killed. there's been some obvious drama surrounding him, but he seems to know the game.i like your ideas and you have my vote. i would love to see eve have a revival in numbers. ccp's subscription information should tell the story and give us some clues."
2/1/2016,reserved for retrospective analysis.
2/1/2016,"ah, a carebear at heart.it's like a tea party, but for alts!"
2/1/2016,"you make some, um... ideas?though i'm not sure if this is a real campaign for csm, or its like the time code went to the at to gank ppl. a lot of your ""ideas"" seem to only be relevant to the undock of a trade hub and i don't think that speaks for the majority of other eve players. also ""cheaper war declarations."" most players who actually start and fight wars would agree 50-500mil to start a war is nothing.i fear that a vote for holeysheet1 would result in a wall being built around all the trade hubs, not allowing any outsiders in. unless like holey himself you already have a jump clone in all the hubs to avoid moving through those things we all call ""star gates."" that being said best of luck to you :)"
2/1/2016,"i think your analysis is incorrect. i think you may be biased by rumours and fiction about me, i'm an opportunist. i am more interested in bringing in fresh players and bringing back some who left because of game changes/boredom/etc. my campaign is for the new player who wants to experience what i did 8 years ago....a sense of excitement, wonder, and mystery.i look back at my industrial ventures and am proud. i can pi and extract moon goo with the best of them; i once made hexite. i believe more players should have access to this income source hence the wish for rarity 8 and 16 moon stuff in high sec. it isn't worth much after all, even the reactions. i do realize mining is integral in the eve economy so why not raise the price of veldspar for example.missions/low sec and null pve could have some improvements in my opinion hence why i made mention of an interdiction nullified ship that has more than 400dps for pve applications. more ded sites are needed for each faction to keep thing interesting, i mean, once you've done the maze a couple times, it gets boring. maybe make 2-3 sites for each level of ded rating per faction faction would be nice.i like the old war deccing system. i say we go back and analyze the worth of the new one. i want new players to experience the heart pounding excitement that i did for a long time. finally i'm not the only one who would like logistic mechanics put back the way they were, retribution was a terrible patch...how many players did we lose on that one?also, i do enjoy popping ships on the undock, no excuses. i also have no problem roaming or hanging out in my new house in uedama. talk of walls is silly, like i said, you've been manipulated into believing things that just aren't true. thanks for the endorsement fella.edit : i read over my first post. there's nothing about undock popping. do you have some other motive here?killing your ships and pods since 2008. killboards don't lie, don't get mad, get better."
2/1/2016,"no motives i was referring to 2 of your ideas ""-a dock timer on logistics ships, but no suspect flag, except to the war target."" - seems like its an issue only on a stationare you saying that all neutral assistance should be removed from having a suspect timer everywhere? or just on hubs with the addition to a dock timer? as logistics are mainly used to rep pos's and assist fleets and really should be open to attacked by anyone on grid if it is neutral,""-dock timer on suspect gank'n'scoop haulers."" - also seems to be an issue for hubs but not really anywhere elsegankers go criminal not suspect so this is mainly for those who steal loot, this happens everywhere in space so a docking penalty isn't really a big deal to can flippers mission loot thieves or anyone but those who do it on hubs.just wondering why you feel these specific issues need to be looked at, over the same issues for the parts of hs that isn't on a station? and what do think can be done for new and old players in terms of wars (that is an issue only in hs) i would like to hear your thoughts on the issues with the current wardec system and why i should vote for you?"
2/1/2016,"i liked eve-nt's questions so much, i thought i would go ahead and post my answers here. eve-nt, i hope this is okay!!!1. please start by giving us a short introduction to who you are and your history within eve online. include how long you have been playing and the groups you have been involved with.i<U+FFFD>ve played eve online since beta. i think i<U+FFFD>m one of the last remaining <U+FFFD>broken<U+FFFD> characters that is in a ceo role. i<U+FFFD>ve met a lot of folks from different groups but i am neutral since i love small groups. my space profession thrives on neutrality. 2. who would you consider to be your key constituents? who you would best represent within the playerbase?everyone. neutrality means that i don<U+FFFD>t have any agenda preference and i prefer the best solution for any problem. 3. please summarise your platform. (preferably using key bullet points)the no-platform platform is not a reform platform but a return to the intent of the csm. the csm was developed to keep ccp in check, not to push changes that only certain groups want.4. why have you decided to run for csm this year?it was time. it seems that every year there is a controversy with the csm. changes also don<U+FFFD>t seem to happen as they should and it seems like the csm is more of a token piece than what it was originally intended. if ccp is simply going to use a single player<U+FFFD>s idea without consulting the csm, why have it at all? 5. have you run for or been a member of csm in the past? if so please list each year and if you were elected. never have. 6. what makes you a unique representative when you compare yourself to other candidates? i think my platform is rather unique. i<U+FFFD>m an older player that has seen a little bit of everything. and because i am neutral does not mean that i don<U+FFFD>t have strong opinions or that i am oblivious to the politics. 7. do you have any out of game experience and skills that make you a good candidate?i<U+FFFD>m technical and i have project management experience. for the csm role, i think the project management experience is critical.8. what areas of eve are you weakest at knowledge wise?every single area. if you think you know eve, there is always something new to learn. referencing question #7, part of my technical expertise is problem/incident simulation testing, i.e. recreation of a issue. or as i call it, building a puzzle. if i run across something that i need to know in eve, i usually test it on the test server. 9. if you were offered unlimited development time - what's the biggest change you would lobby for in eve?i<U+FFFD>m not a developer and it is very hard to say. i think the changes need to be linked so it<U+FFFD>s really a design thing rather than a developer thing. best example would be the jump changes. in my mind, it made more sense to increase fuel costs rather than add incremental timers. why? increased fuel costs meant that miners would need to mine more, creating more targets for pvper. all professions would receive a boost and the cost of the fuel would normalize as long as miners were able to provide product. that would ultimately leave power projection in the players hands because opposing forces could embargo fuel or send small teams to hunt miners. i believe that all sectors of eve are linked and it is bad design to change something in one single area. high sec players often lack excitement due to this and if high sec changes are made, nullsec players are often gripey. make changes fit everyone because this is a single universe. the economy as it sits is a brilliant control if used properly. 10. if you could wind back the clock - what feature or change would you remove from eve?warp to zero change and mines. i miss mines. 11. if you could pick one candidate to be elected with you who would they be and why?i<U+FFFD>m not sure on this. the large blocs usually send good folk but they see problems that smaller groups don<U+FFFD>t. i<U+FFFD>ve always been fond of sugar kyle. 12. what is your favorite memory in eve and why?a client contracted me to evacuate their assets from delve. it required two freighters, two jump freighters, two orcas and about 10 characters. staging for the job took at least two days and the owner of the assets was very antsy since his stuff had been trapped for a while. it started out as standard run until my jump freighters hit lowsec on the return and a small gang of battleships caught me on a undock. i thought for sure that i was going to die and lose the assets but i made it through. i had to wait them out for a while but my pulse was pounding like nothing else!13. what platform(s) do you use currently to engage with the wider player base? if someone wanted to contact you what is the best way to do this? (include twitter/emails/skype/slack etc.)i<U+FFFD>m still playing with this and it will probably be why my campaign fails. i<U+FFFD>m not extremely social because it<U+FFFD>s hard to be neutral when you spend a lot of time around other eve players. human psychology means classifying people into buckets and i just want to be nice and outside of someone<U+FFFD>s bucket. i have opinions and these shouldn<U+FFFD>t be drawn into the wider metagame but simply considered. eve players are passionate and sometimes extreme in their views, i<U+FFFD>m mindful of this fact.14. if people wanted to find out more about your platform - where is the best place to do so? (include blogs, forums posts and podcasts)my csm campaign thread. ask me anything within reason."
2/1/2016,"15. in short - what is your closing statement (no more than 500 words please!)i really want the chance to represent all of you. i<U+FFFD>ve met some brilliant minds over the years but i think the spirit of the csm has been corrupted and it needs to return to what it is: a council. i don<U+FFFD>t have the answers, i don<U+FFFD>t have any way to force ccp to do anything or even a way to reform the council. all i can do is change my approach, make it different than the other approaches and hope that it adds value. i will need at least four players to help me. each of the four will represent their respective areas of highsec, nullsec, lowsec and wormhole space. these players will farm bugs and issues. i plan to use trello to track each issue and i plan to issue a report on what i will take to council. each reported issue must have the problem described and a possible solution. if there is a change that affects multiple groups, each group can have a potential solution and the csm can bring it up to ccp. i<U+FFFD>m not tied to any problem or solution, i<U+FFFD>m your advocate. i hate campaign promises and they always go wrong but this is my single promise: if you bring me the issues, i will take them with me, no matter who you are or where you are from. thank you!"
2/2/2016,this would only indicate you do not like any of the candidates.how could you indicate your disaproval of the system as such?
2/2/2016,"voting for a candidate with a plausible reform manifesto.why, you could even run yourself."
2/2/2016,":salt: wouldn't it be better to actually ask a question about his platform rather than making a snide remark? also hyde doesn't need 30k subs to ensure that people will vote for him. people will vote for him because his video's show that he understands the mechanics of the game and his ability on understanding the game gives him the skill to be rather good at it, which in turn makes it entertain to watch. but the vote would come from his understanding, not his ability to edit and commentate. that's the key, hyde understand the game. he wouldn't be a #swagyoloposter boy.#deletetheweak"
2/2/2016,"i noticed that you have your corporation and alliance disabled in the forums, care to comment? ""i made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter."" ~blaise pascal~"
2/2/2016,"that's probably his way of showing he is there for everyone, not just for his own alliance."
2/2/2016,"nice assumption.however, i think he's trying to disassociate himself from goons.which...would be a smart move.""i made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter."" ~blaise pascal~"
2/2/2016,"sure.i feel that what a person wants to do should be more important to their candidacy than what ticker is under their name.i think grudge matches between people of different space flags have a place in eve, that place is just not here. i am a member of the imperium but i do not feel that should be a factor that determines who will or will not vote for me. i have hidden my corp and alliance ticker because in my view, it simply has no place here in this thread and if elected should stay hidden. this is a personal choice, not something that all candidate should be forced to do."
2/2/2016,"do you honestly expect people to believe that you won't bring the doctrine that you share with the goons to the table?that's like saying, ""i was born into and grew up in the 'x' party but i promise not to bring that party's agenda to 'y' organization"".it just doesn't work that way.you have a lot more growing up to do.""i made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter."" ~blaise pascal~"

2/2/2016,"are you going to answer my question, or just talk about the smell of fish?"
2/2/2016,"i made an analogy hoping you would be able to understand, my mistake.you're running based on reform. you're a goon. you can't expect people to buy that you won't bring goon (de)values with you. why would the player base that mostly despise goons want you to mold the game to give them even greater favor?and since you brought up your corp history, wow!you know what that shows people? that you have a very hard time playing well with others.just another reason you should not be a member of the csm.""i made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter."" ~blaise pascal~"
2/2/2016,"you still have not answered my question.if you are going to make a statement or accusation against somebody, you should be ready to defend it. a certain former member of the imperium made that mistake recently and it cost him."
2/2/2016,"i've answered your question more than once.lol. i know using threats have worked for you in the past.""i made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter."" ~blaise pascal~"
2/2/2016,"so that is a no then, you won't defend your statement or answer my follow up to it. glad we could clear that up."
2/2/2016,"please don't have a temper tantrum on my account.the fact that you've been in 200 corps in 5 years should be enough to disqualify you in my opinion.do you get along with anybody? so much corp drama can't be good for business. gotta keep the rent coming in!""i made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter."" ~blaise pascal~"
2/2/2016,"the fact that you refer to your masters as, ""the imperium"" is seen as an insult by most.merriam webster defines imperium as:1 : supreme power or absolute dominion : control2 : the right to command or to employ the force of the state : sovereigntythat's how you see yourselves, as master's of the universe.most players simply view you as glorified bullies and descendants of bob.no vote.""i made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter."" ~blaise pascal~"
2/2/2016,"i have no masters.the imperium and it's directorate are not in charge of me, they do not order, command or demand anything of me. i am not a servant, or an employee of goons. the notion you are attempting to perpetuate is that i am some sort of plant or goon shill that will only ever perform functions for my ""masters"". this is a very silly notion as you yourself pointed out by referencing my corp history. ""to learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize""i have no gods, no masters. even the most basic research of my history in eve online will show you that."
2/2/2016,"you have made my point absolute.how can you serve ""the people"" with this attitude? i'll answer that, you won't.you'll do whatever you want whenever you want. (as evidenced once again by your corp history.)i'm not saying that you're a bad person or even a bad player. i'm just saying that you're too immature to be a leader.come back in five years.o/""i made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter."" ~blaise pascal~"

2/2/2016,"bob, you have my vote. you have always been a good guy to work with and from what i have seen during my time with en24, you put the good of the game ahead of personal gain.i hope this year you make it all the way.ps. if you do and you find any spare tickets to fanfest just laying around the ccp office feel free to send them my way."
2/2/2016,"met joffy many years ago when he joined the corp i was in out in null, a really nice guy, the corp closed shortly after and he then joined sf and i dosed into skill queue online, but still kept my ears open and followed the politics via different pod casts......so to see you running for csm xi is just fantastic, cant wait for the csm watch interview godspeed - i<U+FFFD>ll be voting with both accounts!"
2/2/2016,updated the initial post to include a few of my previous links and my interview with eve_nt. will be keeping it up to date as things go live and get edited!
2/2/2016,here is the csm watch interview with toxic yaken for the csm 11 election.enjoy!
2/2/2016,"1 - it would be nice to see some sort of reward for highsecers to stay active during war to some capacity, maybe even provide some corporate benefits if they can meet thresholds for activity in highsec, similar to indexes in null. if they manage to maintain x activity they get a day free of the war, shorten the overall length of the war, or something else of that nature. new feature ideas aside, players that don't want to hop into a combat ship can always try flying logisitics, scouting, spying, or stalking as well. wars can have as many dimensions as you want to put into them, and you can make some fun out of it. 2 - i feel like you're alluding to some sort of functional bounty system or something. personally i'd also like to see facpol no longer chasing criminals so that players could do that themselves and provide standings/lp/isk for successfully destroying criminals in highsec. the obvious flip side of that is that the payout can't be so excessive that players can kill their criminal characters with alts and reap insurance/criminal killing rewards that exceed the value of ships. perhaps there could be some sort of diminishing returns for destroying the same character over and over to prevent that. 3 - isn't your package that big thing i always see cyclo flying around with? as far as i'm concerned it's already an 'honorary member.'"
2/2/2016,thanks again for having me stu! :d
2/2/2016,"i am really enjoying your ideas on bounty hunting!!!i do have one idea for a mechanic that might make the system.... i dunno... work?if we had a bounty mission agent this would solve 95% of all bounty scams that would happen. the mission agent gives you a particular target and if you manage to hunt them down perhaps you become able to collect the full bounty for the kill as well as some sweet lp and a bonus. these of course would have to be week long missions. the flip side is avoiding getting caught in hisec is rediculously easy for anyone who isnt a ganker. so this mechanic would mostly apply to catching gankers. i support this in conjunction with removing faction police so that the bounty and the bounty hunter have a meaningful fight and not just ""pointed you, waiting for faction police now to do my job for me"".thoughts?"
2/2/2016,we would have pandered pandas. now if we took the pandered pandas to a beauty salon...
2/2/2016,sorry for the late reply tora. this pretty much sum's up how i feel. my biggest desire to see you in csm is directly because you know war dec's and high sec shenanigans (proper) and you have a well placed desire to see equal game play. i can't say much more than post above.good luck tora!
2/2/2016,"good luck tora. lucas is right, certainly seems a lot better than last years. do you plan on focusing all your efforts if you make csm on highsec aggression mechanics and wardecs? if so do you have any other idea pertaining to, or can you elaborate on; a. suspect baiting, how do you feel about suspect baiting as a mechanic? do you feel it allows too much freedom on the baiters side, do you feel it should lessened? or do you think it sits fine as it is? b. loot stealing, since you do not receive a weapons timer for stealing from wrecks, it makes it very easy in highsec to quickly snatch loot that doesn't belong, if that wreck is in docking range. although most people will say that this is a station campers problem, i know that you understand that most actual wardec based fights more often then not, happen near or in the undock radius, which makes ninja looting from war's a very profitable and easy thing to do. opinions? c. neutral logistics, a lot of people complain about neutral logi being a problem with highsec, others argue that as soon as the neutral logi becomes active in a fight it is arguably in a worse situation then it would if was incorp. what are your opinions on the matter? should neutral logi incur more penalties? should it stay the same? or should it be lessened? d. further detail on ganking? why do you think it needs to be looked at in further detail? do you have any idea's on how to fix the issue? is ganking itself the problem or do you feel it is bumping? or criminal status not incurring enough penalties to the gcc'ed character?#deletetheweak"
2/2/2016,"last year was my first attempt, still a bit green and less connection with the eve player base. main reason i have been more active on twitter and #tweetfleet slack this year. not just highsec agression. i also want to be active in lowsec industry, as that's also one of the things i do in eve.a. i think suspect baiting is a nice feature in eve as it is. i personally don't like the ship swapping with an orca/bowhead/etc while you are suspect (if that's still possible), but am ok with it if you do it in a station.b. loot stealing in space is ok as it is, but i would like to see a short 5 sec timer when you do it on stations. if you sit on an undock all day and you want the easy life, that's ok, but then you also accept the down side of it, losing loot.c. i'm ok with neutral logi as it is right now. use neutral logi, then you go suspect and become useless for fleet fights. you take a risk and you have the option of a reward. nice in balance.d. ganking takes effort and skills and anti gankers have options to not get ganked, but i want to see more pvp fights between them. currently gankers undock, insta warp and when you see them again is on the target. no time to even have a small chance of shooting them. not sure how to improve this yet, but it's something to look in to.bumping i am fine with too, unless you continue this to long. bumping a freighter for 10-15 minutes is just annoying. bumping preparing to gank, fine. maybe someway to have a max bump time.... just a brainwave. bump fatigue !"

2/2/2016,"when i started playing eve in 2003, i was not keen on the mmo/pay to play genre. at the time, i did not see much value in paying a monthly fee for a game. between that and a general sense of confusion over what i can do in eve, i stopped playing after my first month out of beta. i was drawn in again a few years later and played for a longer period before i stopped playing for personal family reasons and over several more years started and stopped again until picking up full time play of eve in 2010.what stands out to me in all cases is that i came back to eve due to the intro movies and later the alliance tournaments showing up on youtube. the idea of eve being this big universe full of danger and adventure was attractive. the idea that i could fly with other people co-operatively and fight others was attractive. my decisions mattered and effected my wallet in interesting ways.i am interested in making this game attractive to new players for the reasons eve is attractive to the older players: a dangerous universe where you are not tied to any one thing. you can become something more and become something better. you can get kicked in the face and learn so that perhaps, one day, you can return the favor. the story line in eve is a good solid story line. it is not one that pretends you are the center of the story - to be that, you have to make it yourself in eve. to be a band of brothers, a mittani, a pandemic legion, etc, you have to work at it to make yourself part of the narrative. these are good things. i believe maintaining risk and depth of play is crucial to player retention.my focus, if elected to csm 11 will be to seek improvements to the player experience as a whole. to make eve less safe overall while improving the interactive experience of the player to the game. the scarcity of something brings strife and conflict. the vulnerable seek the strong to protect them or hide where they may be safe for a time. the story line of eve should progress the universe as a whole, adding content, making the excuse of why something exists the way it does, and otherwise giving those that role-play a solid focus without turning to the foolish model of making the story of eve online about the player itself.* the pvpers should have the tools and resources to get into action, whether a long roam hunting for targets or jumping online to take someone out in a prepared way; pvpers should find their combat challenging and in the end gratifying. no pvper likes twiddling their thumbs searching for combat and their combat records should be easier to find in game for their fame and glory in combat.* the mission runner should be able to fly missions but a concentration of missions should 'deplete' the availability of missions from a given agent making it necessary for the mission runner to seek out other agents until the prior agent has something again. in turn this can increase the value of lp for a given group by scarcity and ccp can equally increase mission rewards so that the casual mission runner gets more for their effort. this depletion is based on everyone obtaining missions for that particular agent so potential pvp situations can be created between mission runners seeking to monopolize an agent. (agent y offers up to x amount of missions per time period and finds z many new offerings over a period of time). ""my apologies capsuleer, but i gave out my last available mission to 'some other capsuleer'.""* for what purpose do war decs exist? except for most structures all things can be destroyed without invoking a war dec (code. is a prime example of this). i would say the war dec mechanic as it is now is broken. should corporations without anchored structures in high sec (mtus excluded from this) be subject to war decs when their blingy ships, freighters, and mining ships can be destroyed without one? unless a player corp. plans to anchor a structure, then perhaps they should enjoy the same immunity from war decs a non-player corp. enjoys.* in the spirit of promoting conflict, null sec anomalies should be treated as a commodity that can suffer from over-harvesting. why do more npcs decide to go to a system where more of them have died? too much harvesting of anomalies, be they mineral or be they npc, should result in an overall decrease of their availability over time. the advantage to this is it will require movement out of a system and into others by ratters and miners. empires may have to look at expansion to obtain more hunting grounds and pvp seekers will find targets with greater frequency as there should be less empty space.i believe in the integrity and responsibility of the csm as an organization representing the interests of the community as a whole in dialogue with ccp. a vote for me is a vote for the items i represent above and most importantly an independent voice. it is one vote less to certain large power blocs.thank you for your support.i would also like to thank my fellow toger doggfather for his valuable input and critique."
2/2/2016,"i mean community in a broader sense. there are some great incursion communities out there, i personally have flown with tvp and tdf and had a great experience with both groups. there are some great indy corps out there, good mining corps, some great chat channels. what i am referring to is the fact that typically hisec dwellers tend to gravitate towards one thing, they may be full time incursion runners, or they may multi-box a bunch of skiffs in an ice belt, but they tend to spend most of there game time doing that one thing. there is nothing wrong with that nor am i looking to change that. what i am looking to do is bring people together in such a way that they really begin to understand how every single person has an impact in eve. i would like to see more honest dialogue between people of different play styles.here is an example, ill look at the solo miner, and the solo miner-ganker. ganker kills the miner, miner sends hate mail, ganker posts the hate mail on miner-bumping.com, gankers laugh, and end of dialogue. now what if we streamed a show where we took a few miners, a few gankers, through them on comms together for a while, and let them talk about eve. how interesting would it be to hear about the challenges that both sides face. how cool would it be if a few miners actually became friends with a few gankers? this is just a small sample of the type of interaction that i think would change how at least some players feel about hisec in a positive way.as far as your incursion based questions, i personally feel that sansha incursions have an adequate payout and here are a few reasons why. its risky to fly around hisec in a bowhead with 2 blingy faction battleships and a logi cruiser in there. you lose that bowhead, you are out 6bil easy all told, nothing to scoff at. depending on what incursion community you run with, you will average somewhere in the 150 mil an hour mark while running the incursion, up or down depending on some factors. so to make back that 6bil, that will take you 40 hours of running incursions. that does not factor in travel time, waiting for fleet invites, times where no incursion is up, etc. for hisec this isk seems excessive, but it is the only way for a single account player to make real isk in hisec. l4 missions are ok isk, usually you upgrade from there to incursions to do better. mining income in hisec is horrible if your a solo account, you basically need to multi-box to make any real isk hisec mining. hisec explo is a crap shoot and has tons of competition. hauling pays not that great in hisec, you have to be a nullsec jf pilot to make real money doing that. so by comparison, since incursions are the only real isk maker in hisec for a single account player, let them print isk doing that. as far as drifter incursions, i do not feel that they should replace sansha incursions. it is up to the player base to decide what they want to run, so if the players decide to ditch sansha for drifters, thats on them, but if ccp eliminated sansha incursions and forced us to run drifters or simply not incursion, i would be upset with that. that said, i ran in a drifter incursion fleet once with isn, we used suicide caracals then did a reship to bombers and it was a blast, i think i am going to run more of them personally. i highly recommend everyone try them at least once. i see no reason why both incursions cannot live side by side.*before anyone says it, yes i know station trading is technically the best isk maker in the game, i left that out on purpose when i said incursions are the only real isk in hisec cause station trading really is its own thing*"
2/2/2016,"yes, i think almost all of us can agree that more player interaction is good in this mmorpg about player interaction. i am asking if you have a specific ideas on how ccp could facilitate that. would region-wide chat channels be a good thing? player-built advertising structures? cheaper wardecs?how can you encourage players, especially from different groups or professions, to interact more in highsec?from a game design perspective, how does it make sense to leave the sansha incursions in the game along side the new drifter ones? if the drifter ones are harder, ever-changing, not completely min-maxed and thus pay less than the current sansha, why would anyone choose to run them as an isk-making activity? if no one runs them (aside from the handful of groups looking specifically for a new challenge - most sit unrun until they expire), then why should ccp spend significant amounts of their development effort iterating on and expanding them? don't you think it is a waste of time to ask ccp to develop new pve content that is just going to be ignored by the majority of the pve playerbase?personally, setting aside the overall economic issues with incursions runners capturing so much of the economy outlined by ccp quant in his devblog, i think the stale sansha incursions are well past their best-before date - the content is old, completely beaten and hasn't been updated in a long time. from a universe perspective, the sansha have spent over 5-years attacking without much success and i would think them ready to give up and try a new approach. anyways, those are my thoughts as a highsec player.thanks for taking the time to answer my questions - i have all the information i need. best of luck on your csm run."
2/2/2016,questions for holey 1 why do you feel pve is currently not profitable enough? what would you see increased?2 would your proposed suspect mechanics not make neutral reps insanely unassailable as they were in retribution?3 low sec industry struggles compared to high sec or nullsec. thoughts? 4 (troll question) i've been thinking of getting face piercings. how many is too many?
2/2/2016,"well i'm surprised that you actually went through with it. why do you think pve activities need more isk? as far as i was aware it's quite profitable i've made billions on incursions, and even stealth bomber running fw sites. also how would you propose a sink for the faucet you are proposing for? also all of your idea's add the ability to make isk more effectively. which wouldn't really make things any better asides with market skullduggery being a problem#deletetheweak"
2/2/2016,"my dear noragen, i have some answers i hope you will find satisfactory.1. pve should be more profitable because basically all prices inflate except pve income. i remember buying a dominix for 32 mill way back when and plexes were 250 mill when i first bought one. running lvl 4's will make you max 40 mill per hour with loot, salvage and bounties. with the inflation we've experienced, this doesn't cut the mustard.ded sites can be great but it depends on the boss drop completely which is random. also, rated ded sites are few and far between. i would like to see more spawn. more ded sites would be great too....sleeper or jovian maybe, plus a variety of new faction ones.incursions seem fine but there seems to be a closed community that does them. i can't sit popping npc's for hours, i have housework and i drink lots of coffee.2.the suspect mechanics hit many in the face and many more unsubscribed due to their logistics toons becoming targets for everyone. a person at war prior to retribution would have to plan ahead to neutralize logi or kill it. i conceded with the dock timer because the logi should be made to flee or die. this was the game i knew for 5 years before they changed it with the retribution patch and it worked for me. interest in the game was higher and everyone had a logi toon....so it was kind of a level playing field imo.3.low sec industry seems worth while mostly. there's moon goo(good luck finding a decent moon btw), some decent ore and if you're lucky maybe a 6/10....not industry sorry. you don't have to deal with bubbles like in null and let's be honest, bpc copying can be risky in low sec. pi can be worthwhile but the concentrations on the planets are meh. plus, a group of bad asses in dreads can come along and vaporize your pocos very quickly.4.as with several things done in my youth, i regret the facial spikes. i think my avatar looks mean so i'll keep him that way. if voted in as csm, i will address the issue of facial spikes. i reccomend as many as will fit.i hope this answered your questions satisfactorily norrykilling your ships and pods since 2008. killboards don't lie, don't get mad, get better."
2/2/2016,"as a science, at heart, economics is basically the study of scarcity and how to assign the resources we have in the most efficient/beneficial/whatever manner possible. generally - high supply and low demand equals lower prices, and lower supply and higher demand results in higher prices. you would like ccp to step in, introduce more pve content, in order to increase the supply? fine, but be prepared for market crashes if you suddenly introduce numerous new shinies outlets, which i'm not sure you want to happen if your goal is to increase the supply of shinies so that carebears may continue to grow rich.what are you on about? apart from bounties, the selling of pve loot (normal loot, faction drops, whatever) is absolutely subject to inflation - check out the trend of, say, cn bcus, or gist/pith deadspace invulnerability fields. those are most definitely a part of pve income."
2/2/2016,"thanks for the economics lesson. did you ever watch that loony toons cartoon on economics, with the 2 mice? i did and from that i understand the basics. the fact remains that inflation of goods hasn't stayed in line with earning of isk. an increase in rated ded sites would benefit many.now bumblefck, if you're just here to troll i have no interest.killing your ships and pods since 2008. killboards don't lie, don't get mad, get better."

2/2/2016,"i pointed out a serious issue in one of your platform items, and you just come back with some crap about cartoons. an increase in ded would benefit no one, as the supply rise (assuming no changes in demand) will just lead to crashing prices - not extra income for everyone.who's trolling?

2/2/2016,"ded sites are like fun missions with some risk. if you get a bad drop, it's worthless. i remember the kul zatath monastery site, i made 500 mill one time, then 5 mill on the next one. it's random. more ded sites = more fun and faction stuff. if the prices crash, we'll still have fun sites to do.killing your ships and pods since 2008. killboards don't lie, don't get mad, get better."
2/3/2016,any other ideas or input? because i've seen a lot here.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
2/3/2016,"that depends on the definition of pvp. eve is a pvp game as in ""everyone has an effect of everyone else"". it's not a pvp game as in ""everyone has to be involved in shooting each other"". i don't agree with the op, but at the same time i don't agree with this entire sentiment that everything should involve the firing of the lasers.wars as they stand are pretty broken, since they have the opposite approach to risk and reward. the weaker the target you go after, the lower the risk and the higher the reward. going after a pure pvp corp will get you tough fights and bad loot, while going after an industrial group gets you easy kills and plenty of loot. there should be better ways for groups to compete and fight, and they shouldn't just involve groups of ""mercs"" hiding behind concords skirt picking off easy targets."
2/3/2016,"seems reasonable enough, but still has a problem where it's not really encouraging fighting, it just encourages endurance. a non-combat group would still have no reason to switch to combat, and to make things worse, aggressors would get locked in. nothing would stop people from creating a corp, baiting in an aggressor, then dropping all important characters leaving it in the hands of a couple of alts and moving to a new corp. wardeccers would still need content so they have to dec other people. eventually wardeccers would end up over invested in attacks with no ability to get out of them without losing their bond. so i think this would still encourage them to go after weaker targets with lower bonds. it also makes wardecs cost less over time, making permadecs no longer a costly endeavour, and removes wardec fees as an isk sink.from a content standpoint i think the most important thing to remember is that if people don't want to fight, they won't. so don't build the system around fighting those people and giving them reasons to fight. instead build the system around fighting people who do want to fight and use the people who don't as an unwilling resource. if someone could take over an area and takes say 20% of the mining yield, market tax and bounties for example, they would have a reason to take that area and other people would have reasons to fight them for it. kind of like how the pocos generated a whole bunch of war.people who didn't want to fight would either have to put up with the taxes in the area they are in, strike a deal with the owners or move. people who were willing to fight would do so. wardecs would be as simple as buying into the fight, making your corp/alliance legal targets for anyone else optioned in for that area. it could be something like kills by your corp in that area give you points and whoever has the most points at downtime flips control. as long as the areas of control were quite fluid in their ownership and demanded constant fighting to maintain control rather than being stagnant like sov content, then there would be a constant stream of fights. non-pvp content like ratting/mining would have no effect on control, and would be generating funds for the owners warchest."

2/3/2016,"hi joffy,ganking is a top-of-mind issue in hisec, esp in the carebear community.the key feature of ganking is a profit motive. there is no profit motive in anti-ganking. also with the current game mechanics ganking has become low risk for high reward.what would you do to restored the balance?thieving pirates discuss integrity; anarchist gankers give us laws; and whoring merc's cry then blow off clients with insults."
2/3/2016,"thanks to everyone who has shown their support for my campaign, both here on eve-o and on twitter, it is very much appreciated.firstly, i would say that the perception of ganking is very different to the reality of it, i would also say that it is not necessarily the primary concern of mission runners, and most haulers know ways to reduce the risk.i have had highsec alts doing hauling, mining and other activities, and whilst ganking is of course something to be aware of, it was not a problem for my characters.to answer your other questions, i dont believe anti-gankers do what they do for profit, however, i think it is a shame that anti-ganking is purely reactive at present, that is, after seeing intel, anti-gankers have to sit on a gate waiting for the gank attempt to begin, and hope they can assist in time.i feel that there are things haulers and miners can do to reduce the likelihood of being ganked, but, as with everything else in eve, if someone really wants to take you out, they will. as to the risk vs reward, there is always room for change in mechanics, but, i am not really sure how i would change this particular one, but i am open to suggestions from both sides to improve it."

2/3/2016,"i have always picked the side of eve online's balanced content. you get the most fun, when both sides have equal opportunities. currently i think attackers have more then the defenders. this is what i want to rebalance."
2/3/2016,"you are comparing two different mechanics of a game and saying they obsolete each other. that's like saying in call of duty why have guns in the game when the player can just knife every one? by your logic cod should remove one or the other completely, or make one completely and utterly different. or how i can go to lowsec and pvp and that highsec should be completely safe, your idea is just less extreme. wardecs need to be tweaked they are not broken. they need to be refreshed and given a new coat of paint. like almost all of highsec. but adding arbitrary limits to a sandbox is not what a sandbox game needs by definition it should be left open. npc corps are fine as they are with wardec immunity, they have proven to be more than enough for players to commit to daily every day gameplay of eve. cas being a prime and active example. other npc corps are of course not like cas, but that is player driven content, and the tools provided by the game is obviously enough for other npc corps to flourish as cas has. also npc corps are arguably worse, as one man rolling corp is even more effective because you can a zero tax rate and still dodge decs with no consequences. your idea is just another one more nerf and it'll all be balanced. if you want to focus on tweaking wars, you should think more along the lines on how to make wardecs better, not add more and more nerfs. regardless good luck.#deletetheweak"
2/3/2016,"which is why i bring up the question. whether one thinks that wardecs are broken or need tweaking is a matter of opinion. however, regardless of one's opinion, changes can be made to improve war decs. ultimately: how? this is a discussion that should be had. i do not think that adding a class of corp that cannot be war dec'ed if they choose not to be and have no assets in space would be considered a nerf when a very large population in high sec exists in npc corps which, by default, cannot be war dec'ced nor can they have assets in space. the difference is that the corp can segregate itself in a distinct way that npc corps do not allow and retain the benefit that npc corps give: protection from war decs. but how would you look at tweaking the war dec system to improve and refine it?"
2/3/2016,"i personally believe that every action in eve needs to have consequences. that's why i personally like the game. remove consequences you remove risk, a core part of eve's current philosophy. as such, a social corp as you propose. is in my honest opinion a way to shierk past some of limits of an npc corp. you get your own name, and your own tax rate, while still avoiding the possibility to be wardeced by another entity. npc should be a place for player who don't mind restrictive play at the price of less content. social corps, or your idea, is a away to allow more to a player who doesn't want to risk while maintaining the same amount of protection that an npc corp offers. npc corps would be functionally barren. as all the current npc hold outs would make there own corps never put up a tower and go on there way. this is a nerf to wardecs, as it allows players who wish to avoid them, go on with no change in their lives, but severally cuts the wardeccers content down by a large amount. i personally do not believe that wardecs should be centered around structures. structures are tedious and you yourself want to avoid tedium. also i would assume that your idea would make it impossible for a agressor to dec unless he owned a structure himself yes? so your idea would force wardec alliances into becoming bigger. more so than they are now, because small entities, would not be able to properly defend their own structures. making it that the only wardec alliance around are those who can pull enough members to properly protect their own means to content while systematically destroying others. it would be an arbitrary set victory condition. who ever whips the other structures first wins the war. off the top of my head. 1. pricing needs to be worked by taking total corp sp into account high total sp mean less isk, corp age into account older corps should be cheaper, and total corp members if you have more members it should be cheaper, currently it cost more to dec a corp with more members. corps contain dec immunity for a week after creation. however corp creation prices are increased to the mean average of the price of a dec. however if you are a new player the first corp creation is free. 2. corp creation tutorial, teaches you about corporations in eve and along with that wardecs and how they function. this is also show when a new player enters a corporation for the first time. details what a corporation does and how you can be effected while in one. 3. wardecs are limited to 2 allies only for the defender. 4. introduction of a declaration bounty pool. if the defender destories assets that belong to the aggressor it isk paid to the defender at the end of a war. if aggressors do not lose assets or at the completion of a contract based dec, (see below) or kill more than 50% more than the defender the isk bounty is not rewarded. 5. introduction of contract based wardecs. contractee can offer real binding contracts to mercenaries. the contracts have goals set by the contractee and if goals are not met, contract defaults and the isk is not paid to the mercenary. these goals can be isk destroyed, certain players deaths or removal of assets. contract decs will be paid by defender at the start of the dec and refunded back to them at the end of the dec if contact to not met, from the aggressors wallet. if the corp wallet goes negative the corp will go bankrupt and automatically close in a week. during the week other contracts can be fulfilled bring the corp's wallet saving them from closing. edit: defender is notified about contract, and can pay a small fee to see the details of contract. however the contract issuer is not available for viewing. if a contract is a player based kill, that player can not leave corp during the dec. if a player contact is completed, player can not be targeted again for two weeks by any corporation by contract. however the player can still be fried upon if another he happens to be in an active war after contract is met. 6. after war has ended, either contract based, or paid dec, the corp enters a stasis mode, if the defender wins by kill more than the aggressor the war they enter a wardec immune state for a week, if neither corp kills anything, or the defender losses more isk than what they killed they enter stasis for 3 days. my idea's are not perfect and be min/maxxed and exploited, however i'm not the one running for csm. =p regardless those are something's that pop into my head when i think about tweaking.#deletetheweak"

2/3/2016,"region wide chat channels would be cool, i know years ago people were talking about how interesting those would be, but it never went anywhere. more methods for player adverts should be implemented. i have alot of ideas on wardecs to benefit both the war deccer and the carebear, and a change in cost structure is one of those ideas. since i am on the topic of war decs; i will say that due to seeing so many new players quit the game over a war dec since a 16 day old account sitting in a retreiver has no idea how to deal with it, i would like to make it so accounts that are under a certain age, say 30 days or 45 or w/e will be exempt from the war dec. they can be in the corp that is war decd, but they wont be flashy red to the war deccers or anything like that unless the account has aggressed someone in hi or low sec thereby voiding the war dec immunity since at that point the account is being used to pvp. as far as getting people in hisec from different professions interacting, i think chat streams are growing in popularity and alot more people are listening to them, so those can be utilized. also i would like to organize more game wide player events, the last event i remember where the whole game was invited was burn amarr. i would like to structure various types of events open to the whole game but probably will be attended mostly by empire dwellers, and run them relatively often, get people out of there normal day activity and doing something with alot of people. as far as incursions go, i agree sansha incursions are dry and need an update, so i think an update should come. drifter incursions are such a different play style i honestly do not understand how they can replace the sansha incursions, it's kind of like saying why run ded sites in hisec when u can just run l4s and get that stable income. while both are combat oriented, there are very different pve content. incursions are similiar, sansha sites are run in blingy faction fit ships that ourside of incursions most players will never fly. drifter incursions are run mostly in suicide cruisers and catalysts and bombers and that kind of stufff. if both incursions were being run with fleets of vindis and scimitars i would say yeah we have redundant content, but as of the currents state we do not. plus drifter incursions are still kind of new, it took people a while to get good at sansha incursions (anyone remember hour long tpph's in drake fleets?) and people are still feeling out the drifters, in time we will have a better idea of where the relationship between the 2 incursions.on a side note, i agree that story-line wise, sansha has failed for years now, so i think some interesting plot twists could happen if sansha incursions were updated properly and some things change, and we got a cool scope video or 2 of new sansha rats invading to drive the plot."

2/3/2016,"greeting again today my friends. i thought i would talk about margin trading today as it's something i've made billions on when i was a new character and even now to an extent. to those who don't understand margin trading, i can give you a few tips.1. have a toon that sits in jita and make sure he is trained to have at least 40-50 open orders on the market. the skills margin trading and accounting help also with taxes and deferred payments.2. now here's the tricky part. do a market survey and find items with decent margins between buy and sell orders. add these items to your market quick bar to make things easier. it can be difficult finding profitable items, i myself have about 20-30 items that buy and sell quickly.3. set up buy orders for those items through the market interface and wait for the items to appear in your inventory. now here's the trick : buy your items an isk above the highest bid and sell an isk or 2 below the lowest sell. now you can start watching your wallet blink like crazy; income each time whether it's a sell or completed buy order.4. i've only had luck in jita, elsewhere it seems pretty dead...the orders never fill.i've pretty much done it all in eve, so if you have any questions, please feel free to mail me anytime. have a great day.killing your ships and pods since 2008. killboards don't lie, don't get mad, get better."

2/3/2016,
2/4/2016,"so this is an idea that i had seeded from a reddit post concerning the iapetan class of titans. the post was not concerning gameplay; it was simply fun concerning their scale and size. but it made me want to see one. not necessarily make them available to capsuleers, but i wanted to see one. i then molded an idea for how they could be brought into the game, which i proposed in that reddit thread and got decent positive feeback on.currently, incursions are kinda stale. sure, the drifter incursions are new, but they are crazy difficult and broken due to the amarrian navy not participating in the fight. the only way i have seen them done so far is by whelping thrashers into them until they are all dead. not the hottest of gameplay. on the other side, sansha incursions are so stable that losing a ship in one is very rare, and they feel more like a grind than level 4 missions. out of this i gained the concept for a new incursion, possibly replacing the unsuccessful drifter incursions. it was brought up in that reddit thread that one of these super titans is owned by the serpentis. now would any self respecting pirate organization own the largest and strongest mobile battle station so to ship it while it is docked? of course not! thus i reached the idea of the serpentis incursion. these incursion sites and scales would greatly trump that of the current sansha incursions, as the serpentis are looking to carve out a piece of empire space to join in with the big 4. since this is more than just a little power struggle that is the sansha incursions, the smallest serpentis incursion sites would be equivalent to the current sansha hqs in difficulty. from there it scales up.now getting more than 40 people in a fleet with the sole purpose of earning isk is difficult enough as it is, so i don't expect the sites to demand a much larger fleet to run them. mayhaps 50 for the medium sites and 60 for the strongest sites. more of a focus would be put on proper use of fleet tactics, such as electronic warfare (damps for sniping ships that will boat closer when their lock range is reduced) or requiring bhaalgorns to neut out the triage carriers that the serpentis would be using. oh, didn't i mention? there has to be a mom site. the big one. after 2-4 ish weeks of the incursion (duration tbd), the mom shows up. and that iapetan class titan? that is the mothership of the site. that would be the reason why capitals would be allowed back into highsec. i think that a simple balance solution of forcing capitals to not be allowed to shoot at players and player owned structures, even it safety green allows it (wardecs), and allowing high sec cynos only in the sites, for the purpose of getting the caps onto the battlefield. to take down the iapetan class titan, i would guesstimate that 200k-250k dps would be needed just to break its tank. meanwhile you have it literally trying to use a slightly weaker but faster firing doomsday (maybe 750k damage instead of 2 mil on a 2 minute cooldown, but it does not like to choose the same target twice). in addition you also have a perpetually spawning wave of serpentis ships coming to defend their titan.now for an incursion this difficult, and this resource-intensive, there needs to be a payout. naturally you get isk and concord lp for the normal sites, maybe also with other goodies like serpentis faction loot and bpcs. but for the mom, whatever fleet gets top damage, gets a xl citadel bpo. (dropped in a secure container so it can't get shot or stolen, specifically for the fleet boss) that kind of a prize is sure to get people chomping at the bit to try and get top damage.naturally a proposal this large and expansive will not happen right away, and maybe its too late for a xl citadel bpo to be the best prize for the last site. there would also need work to be done to actually model serpentis capital ships and the iapetan class titan. also to create the sites and add special code for cynos to be allowed in the sites. i have no idea is this will get anywhere beyond a dream, but i want the lore to live, and i think this is a good way for it to breathe the air of new eden once more."

2/4/2016,"i am currently working, so i am unable to respond in full, but quick answer to this:no. the idea only applies to the defending corp. all corps would have the option to be war dec'ed as well initiate war decs (by default it should be set to allow) or turn it off at the sacrifice of accepting the same limitations that npc corps have with regards to structures (and maybe even corp hangers etc.) it does not fix war decs but expands options for players. yes, it would mean that marmite and other corps would not be able to war dec that corporation, but it is no different than had the individuals remained in an npc corp. one could add further restrictions to balance it out. while it will result in fewer dec-able targets, you should be more likely to get a decent fight from a defending corp rather than waste isk and time dec-ing a target that will turtle or simply reform as another corp. after all, you want a fight when you issue a war dec, right?i'll expound further later on when i am not working."

2/5/2016,"eve has lost over 20 thousand players in the years i have played this game, and it is sad to see.the player base continues to tell ccp that the one thing that drives players away the most is ccp continuing to allow players to suicide kill other players in empire space, with little to no ramifications for their actions, while the players they kill take huge losses.no one will continue to play under such circumstances, and the drop in population shows it.take ccps position allowing suicide ganking in empire to continue to it's natural conclusion; no one will bother to contribute to the economy because it would just be destroyed, and everyone would sit around and suicide gank each other until there is nothing left.all ccp has to do is disable people from being able to fire on each other in empire space without a war dec. very simple, they already have the mechanic in the game - bombs don't work in empire, capitals can't jump to empire, etc. ccp, if you want to attract people to play this game, create a safe space for people to learn and play in safety, and then move out to null sec or take part in war decs when they are ready.dust514 is shutting down, your valkyrie product is not going to have a good reputation either, when your preceeding product is hated by most of the gaming community.will the council try to get across to ccp that the on going state of eve-online is glorified gang warfare, disgusting to all civilized people, and must change as outlined above, to continue to survive.times have changed, eve-online has to change to, or die."
2/5/2016,ccp statistics disagree with you.
2/5/2016,"while i don't agree with the op, people need to stop spitting out those statistics, since all it shows is that ccp isn't very good at data analysis. the biggest problem is that they didn't look at the circumstance of those players joining. for example they say ""people who die play longer"", but if an existing player who pvps were to recruit a friend, they would be more likely to die because they would be brought rapidly into the game, while someone who joined of their own volition would be less likely to die. since we know too that people who join corps and get involved are more likely to stay that tells me that they actually have their stats backwards. it's not that people who die are more likely to stay, but in fact people who are more likely to stay are also more likely to be the ones who are put in a position where they lose ships. see how it's pretty easy to just wrap an interpretation around stats?that's why ccp were so surprised by their own findings, because they were pretty much guessing."
2/5/2016,"while concurrent logged in player counts have indeed gone down, we have no evidence how many players and accounts that really translates into and ccp isn't saying. player activity (kills, trading, etc.) seems to have been affected much less, and there is no evidence that highsec violence has impacted this at all as shah said. certainly you are wrong when you say that no one will play under those circumstances as i play because of that. i am not alone: there are many people who play because of the player-driven economy, and sense of real loss that this game features as one of its main pillars that is enable by a lack of a 100% safe space. do not make the mistake of thinking everyone is like you or that you speak for everyone else. highsec has been unsafe for almost 13 years and the game has not ground to a halt. if anything, the game grew faster at times when highsec was less safe earlier in eve's history. suicide ganking (and other conflict) facilitates the competition that gives things value in this game. it makes the game much more interesting by meaning the players that min/max production most efficiently don't always win - defending your stuff is a concern which you as a producer/industrialist have to balance against pure yield. this conflict literally prevents the economy from being driven into the ground by overproduction and gives our virtual assets meaning.this cannot work in an open-world, single shard competitive sandbox game. if you make highsec 100% safe, which you would be doing by only leaving wars as npc corp members are immune from them, then all the veterans in this game would move their production back to this safe zone. they would use their resources to out-compete the new players, and also deprive the game of all non-consensual targets. the game would then grind to a halt with players awash in ships and no meaningful targets to use them on. the economy would collapse and everyone would move on. besides, eve's is intended to not be 100% safe. that is what has brought and keeps many people here. why should that be changed now, especially given eve online has outlasted almost all if its contemporaries?if you hate eve, like you claim without evidence so much of the ""gaming community"" does, why are you paying ccp to keep playing? just go play one of the multitude of other space-themed games out there that does not feature non-consensual pvp sandbox play in its core design. eve is not going to change for you. carebears have been saying the same thing as you since eve was released and here we are, eve online is still trucking along featuring more-or-less the same gameplay since the server went online. there is nothing wrong with eve. it clearly just not a fit for you. spend your energies finding a game that suits you better rather then whining plaintively for ccp to change their successful product to suit your tastes. you will be much happier."
2/5/2016,"again, not agreeing with the op, but you say this like this doesn't already happen. the veterans already do use highsec for industry and don't lose a thing. ganking isn't an end-game activity, it's an activity with a low barrier of entry used to kill newer and less informed players. this is why the only changes i'd care to see for ganking is to make it require more of an investment, make it less formulaic and predictable, and give anti-gankers a hope in hell of fighting back. anti-ganking is significantly harder and significantly less rewarding than ganking, which doesn't really make for good balance. giving them a better way to fight back would produce more content.just fyi, if highsec were totally safe from pvp, eve would still not be 100% safe. that would require all parts of space to be safe. even if there were no chance of pvp, it wouldn't be 100% safe until even npc stopped shooting players. so suggesting that the op is pushing for 100% safety is far from correct.this is the ""how dare you have an opinion that differs from mine, you should just quit instead"" argument, so is more a sign that you believe your own arguments are weak enough that you need to op to leave to save you. wait, what? so carebears have been saying this all along? there's a lot of carebears in this game, and if they've all been saying the same thing for so long, perhaps that in itself is a testament to the strength of their opinions. slowly but surely pedro, you are convincing me that the carebears have the right frame of mind here. also, a game still having the same gameplay as it had when it was launched over a decade ago isn't necessarily a good thing (and in this case is demonstrably false)."
2/5/2016,"interview posted from eve nt, thank you for giving me the opportunity!"
2/5/2016,"noobman. some questions.q1. what will you be doing to encourage more pvp corporations in wormspace ? especially in higher class wormholes.q2. do you see any mechanic changes that could encourage more frequent and sustainable pvp in wspace ? if so would you promote them as csm ? (when i say sustainable i mean more fights but less evictions so the opposition gets to recover and come back to fight another day instead of a large percentage quitting eve, which often happens after a eviction)q3. do you think the increase in farmholes is a healthy thing for wspace ? (edit.. liked your responce here to this issue."

2/5/2016,"on any other post then this you would be right (as thats what tora does), but like i said before, this is a serious csm post where we should be able to seriously discuss subjects. as a csm you should be able to handle disagreements. if you cant, you shouldnt run for csm."
2/5/2016,"i would like to know your thoughts on the bounty system. i think the fix presented a few years ago was rushed and temporary and the whole system is overdue a rework. in my opinion kill rights work, but i think they are backwards. a player should be able to issue a kill right on a player for a reward to the person completing the kill. what are your thoughts on this?i agree with your sentiments on bumping, though bump fatigue is a little extreme :) i think mjd's for haulers would be interesting."
2/5/2016,"i've had so many thoughts about the bounty system since they first started it and yes, it never really worked. outside highsec people often fly small ships or pods, so getting 20% of the killmail is not worth it and in highsec there are so many people abusing it to scam players, that even if you see a killright, you often need to long to check it all before you activate it. why would you need to buy a kill right at all, you're hunting down someone for someone else aka working. offering a reward on a certain player via a killright makes more sense. that also solves the problem of war deccing an entire alliance/corp just because you have issues with 1 guy.yeh, bumping fatigue is a bit to much, was just kidding. mjd's for haulers. that would make ganking way harder. i'm ok with harder, unless it makes it almost impossible to gank, then it would be unbalanced again towards the other side. but yeh, something to look into to."
2/5/2016,"at least bring back the criteria that a pilot has to have bad sec status before you can place a bounty on him/her. perhaps have another mechanic for placing a ""hit"" on someone.bounty: an amount of money given to someone as a reward for catching a criminalto put a big red, ""wanted"" on someone implies that they've committed a criminal act.""i made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter."" ~blaise pascal~"
2/5/2016,vote vic!
2/5/2016,"i think the sensationalized fiction about me is a wonderful way to learn about my role-playing villainous ways. the lead farmer saga was a personal attack on a level unknown in internet gaming. i did nothing to them but yet they made up all this fiction, as well, real life threats were involved. honestly, they were lucky they didn't have interpol show up at each of their doors, but i realized it was just a bunch of computer geeks from the uk, and couldn't be bothered. photo shopped texts and images that will immortalize me, in a way i've learned to accept. at least i've killed over a trillion in isk now and collected some of it, it was about 3 billion that was stolen from me when i lost my wh network.i'm sorry for the previous post. some people must bang their head of an imaginary wall i suppose.have a great daykilling your ships and pods since 2008. killboards don't lie, don't get mad, get better."
2/5/2016,"so, i thought an interesting topic today would be setting up a reaction of moon minerals in a series of pos's from my recollection and experience.i used internet resources and about a couple dozen moon probes to find my system. i found 2 viable moons for extraction and reaction. it was 2 moons, a platinum moon and a chromium moon. i checked and there was a reaction for hexite, what a fun endeavour i thought.now i wanted to do this on-the-cheap because i knew the pos's could be vaporized at any time and fuel costs for the pos's were a part of the equation also. at the time...i think it was maybe 2010, the profit after costs was about 900 mill a month which was great for me as plex's were hovering around 300-400 mill, everything was substantially cheaper.i had my fancy new crane and a sense of adventure. i knew this would take a few trips so i bought all the stuff including the old pos fuel elements for about a month. that's a medium pos of your choice, and a small pos for starters. i needed two moon extractors, 1 for each moon, 4 silos, a simple reactor and the hexite reaction blueprint or whatever it is.ok, so i anchored my pos's, got them running and anchored the moon extractors and linked them to the silos at each moon. the medium pos had just enough powergrid and cpu for my needs as far as the reaction. so my moon goo starts filling up in the silos...what a glorious thing, practically, completely passive isk generation.now i set the reactor up at the medium pos linked with the last 2 silos; one for the platinum i was collecting at the small pos and the other for the finished product, the hexite.once i had amassed enough of each material i started her up. it was a beautiful thing, i transported the platinum to the medium pos, put in the hexite reaction bp and it starts printing isk. i had it up for a few months before a large entity at the time asked me ""nicely"" to go away. i knew my moon harvesting time was over so i bought all hardeners and guns/utility defences and anchored them to both pos's and left with a message that ill go down fighting thanks very much. if not that, at least waste their time a little longer shooting down the pos's. i left the solo moon mining venture ahead of the game...minus 2 pos's. in the end it was a great experience. trying to find any viable moons is a tough job however in today's eve.that's why i think rarity 8 and 16 moon materials should be offered in high sec. it's a fun process to set up and it's isk made easy.we need prices to go down, eve is getting too expensive as far as in-game ships/items. this would contribute to helping lower prices which is good for everyone except the fat cats who profit from gouging the players.have a great day everyone, i hope this was enlightening to some. it was similar to the lead farmer's saga which follows me like a fictional/virtual ball and chain, but these guys just took their moons and didn't go on a crazy rampage making up slanderous stories and threatening me in real-life. negatives aside, moon mining is great fun and as your csm representative i will look into moon materials being offered in high sec for the benefit of newer or older players. i think it would set off a lot of competition and interest too. edit : this would also make high sec pos's/citadels an interest to more people. at the moment a high sec pos has limited use and apeal. plus as many of us know, getting your state standing to 5 can takes quite a bit of grinding...killing your ships and pods since 2008. killboards don't lie, don't get mad, get better."

2/6/2016,"my name is sapporo jones. and i care. i care about you regardless of whether you care about me because we are a community. a family. a collective of individuals collectively greater than the sum of our individual parts.i care. i want to make this a better experience for you. i want to make this game better for me, for my alliance, and yes even for you. for us. i care. together in this community we are a group of headline making, revenue driving, enthusiastically awful at games, new bro, bitter vet, krabbing baddasses. and we deserve better representation. we need and deserve this. i care and want to provide it for you.i care. my top issues i would like to bring to ccp are the following:1. accrual rate of jump fatigue.a. we know the logi ships are fine, but the accrual rate of fatigue is too high. the phoebe changes are fine and have fundamentally changed how we strategically and tactically approach combat. it affects how we commit and where and why. that being said, even jumping a capital .5ly away gives you more fatigue than you should reasonably accrue. it's not a bad system, it just needs some changes.2. how best to bring back the sense of grandeur eve once had.a. one of the things that brings people in to this game in significant numbers is the grand sense of scale our player driven events engender. fozzie sov, while fine and ever changing and evolving, has dried up that sense of grand scale. gone from eve of late are the large scale bloc on bloc fights. sure much of this content was n+1 content, but it was grand and beautiful and a spectacle unmatched in any other game. we need that back. it's ours, we want it and deserve it, we should fix what it takes to bring it back. b. determining methods to enable more new moderate sized alliances to enter the fray and become contenders. sov null is stale. there are a few regions that frequently change hands, but many of the regions have been held by the same people for ages. enabling people to skirmish properly over this space and better establish a foothold is good for the game. c. eve needs dank memes. you know it's true. you wanna know how many rare pepes there are that are eve related? zero. goose egg. less than bupkes. 3. a style guide for good posting.a. who better to bring about the new era of good post than the current sitting exec and best poster of our group of badposters. you don't want a lex arson teaching people how to post do you? no. you want uncle sappo. he cares about you. 4. i care. a. about you.so please join me in welcoming me in to the race for csm! together we can make eve great again. my name is sapporo jones and i care.paid for by friends of the unpaid executor"

2/6/2016,"first off, there are eve related rare pepes, but they are rare enough that you haven't seen any. i might share one if you answer these questions.lets say ccp asked for your opinion regarding the skill sucker aur pricing model. what would you have you said? don't retcon.are you going to try to participate in balancing discussions? what is the csm? what does it do? do we need you in it? what changes would you champion to bring back people who haven't played in a while?what changes would you champion to bring in new players?how do i know you're not going to get in based on the votes of your dudes, and then do nothing like a huge percentage of null leader csm dudes?does this look like a butt to you? people are talking about making eve f2p? would you support that? how would you recommend implementing a f2p eve to ccp if that was the direction they were looking to go?"
2/6/2016,"good questions! here is my answers in response to your questions:lets say ccp asked for your opinion regarding the skill sucker aur pricing model. what would you have you said? don't retcon. i have been open in test about how i think people should be able to buy small sp packs. there's so much you can already buy i don't really see a real problem with it. on a personal level i've played eve long enough to see what people can do with literally day one alts. when battleships were the largest ship one could aspire to i remember as goons took down a battleship in a fleet of rifters. there's more to this game than skillpoints but we can't consistently get that in to people's brain and at the same time have eve remain approachable in the modern age. i think a solid middle ground is purchasable sp. i'm still not clear on how solid the process currently is or whether it is good long term for the game, but i think the idea functionally is sound.are you going to try to participate in balancing discussions? yes. if allowed to i would like to. what is the csm? what does it do? do we need you in it? the csm is an organized group of active players in the community who act as ombudsman for the players to ccp. regardless of principle or image that's the fundamental principle. we need diverse people representing diverse interests and those interests should align with player interests. i believe i bring value to the organization by being a solid delegate from a player base that is an institution in this game, sov null players. also i love you and care about you. no homo. unless some homo.what changes would you champion to bring back people who haven't played in a while?i want for jump fatigue accrua changesl, changes to sov null mechanics with regards to ui elements and capture/defense process, and tools for community organization and involvement. there are, i feel, many ways that through the user interface with some changes and tweaks enable larger communities to function as synergistically as smaller communities. what changes would you champion to bring in new players?more diverse camera options that enable more complicated videos to be taken with in game ui functions. the idea of the camera drone is archaic. what we have now is orders of magnitude better than what we had, but enabling people to create content and then enabling that content to be presented to new players in a way that preserves the spectacle of combat in eve is fundamental to attracting new players. how do i know you're not going to get in based on the votes of your dudes, and then do nothing like a huge percentage of null leader csm dudes?i told test as well as our allies in the dominion that we are not going to do a proper bloc ballot. i support that for our bros when they want that support. i, personally, want my friends in test and the dmd to vote their conscience and not vote because i tell them to vote for me. given that, in the unlikely event i am actually nominated it won't be because i abused the stv with a bloc vote. as far as other null leader dudes doing that, that's their call. the bloc vote has been successful in the past, it will be again, i will consider myself honored if i am on their ballot but i won't ask for it. does this look like a butt to you? yes. it does. it absolutely does."

2/6/2016,"for those who have contempt for the discussion of high sec aggro mechanics:-70% of the game population lives exclusively in high sec, therefore highsec must be engaging.-the state of highsec is the state of the game. we need reps who understand the risk structure of highsec-if we are being honest, high sec is nearly perfectly safe if you avoid the pipeline and hubs... perfect safety feels good, but is not truly engaging.-cheap war decs reduce the size and quality of corps that declare war... so that normal corps can win. the super mercs only exist because war is so expensive. before retribution, a war dec corp with 3-5 members was normal. that means target corps can win and still get playtime (when the aggressors are logged off).-can flipping was the ""gateway"" to pvp. it was casual pvp you could dabble in without commitment or expense. it was the best pvp mechanic in the game. we need it back. without it, highsec is turning into a boring place.when i joined, i undocked into a carnival of baiters, flippers, and smacktalkers. i feared them, but i watched their fights and local chat with fascination.now, noobs undock into pristine silent lonely space...alone. there is nothing happening outside station. there is nothing in local chat. the whole of highsec is full of nothing."

2/7/2016,totally agree..thanks for laying it out so clearly

2/7/2016,"he's the head community manager at ccp and has been for years. his primary job is to communicate the player base about the game, including what type of game ccp is developing.you must not think very highly of ccp if you think they hired some renegade who does not represent the corporate views of ccp and the views of the lead developers of this game. you can think anything you want. that doesn't change the reality of the situation. if you don't like what ccp is selling, then go somewhere else. thankfully, there is no shortage of gaming companies these days, developing all sorts of types of games. you are not starved for alternatives."
2/7/2016,have been going around the forums and came across the post above...- this is something i have always felt...that post and reading ccp falcon's extremist views on gameplay have convinced me to quit...i'll check back every now and then to see if they fix hisec the right way..have fun..
2/7/2016,"best of luck finding a game that suits you better. if you like the eve universe, and have the means to get your hands on an oculus rift, perhaps valkyrie would be more up your alley. but i am sure you will have no problem finding something else that is a better fit.fly safe, wherever you end up."
2/7/2016,"just cancelled all my accounts. feels so good!thanks for linking the ccp falcon statement.. i kind of alluded to it in my reason for leaving:"".. ccp refuses to balance hisecccp clearly favors the gankers & griefersscrew ccp falcon and his ""dark, gritty and unsafe anywhere"" universe.. he should realize he's a developer, not a player .."""
2/7/2016,"i warned you about ccp falcon's views...and those are the views of ccp. have been ever since the founding of the game. people have told you this, it is in ccp documents available on their website...and yet here you are complaining that eve wont change to suit your view of what the game should be.good bye and good riddance."
2/7/2016,"you start to sound a lot like admiral foxbolt...he represents the interests of ccpalso, let me remind you that this is a sandbox, which means people can do whatever they want, to whoever they want.there is no such thing as ""solo gameplay""... if you sell something on the market, another player bought it or some other dude will .01isk pvp youeveryone should have this wall'o'text popping up before they start the game or make a petition... otherwise we'll keep seeing meaningless threadnoughts that go nowhere"
2/7/2016,good lord...what a load of stupid nonsense.
2/7/2016,the anticipation is killing me.
2/7/2016,"your platform is weak and pretty much pointless. i know you have support as i've heard from 1 or 2 people.that aside, i wish you luck in the campaign. have a great day.ps i wonder who the goons and such will be told to vote for? poor sheep eh?killing your ships and pods since 2008. killboards don't lie, don't get mad, get better."
2/7/2016,the perspective is really different from this side of the culture wall. as i have said in previous posts addressing this sort of question; goons haven't made or forced me to do anything. a ballot for the entire imperium is made at some point but nobody is going to be kicked from the alliance if they don't vote accordingly.
2/7/2016,eve-nt posted my csm xi profile
2/7/2016,"the judge is one of those rare people you don't come across too often in life and even less often in a place like eve. through all of the dark and shady bits of eve the judge stands apart. being incredibly intelligent and very fair he is a man of both tact and composure. if i had to use one word to describe him it would be ""professional."" he has the ability to always be positive in the face of extreme odds while still maintaining a realistic frame of mind. merging seamlessly into any social situation he is able to converse with all types of players on all levels with relative ease. because of these things he has been an outstanding diplomat and i am proud to call him friend. most importantly though he is passionate; passionate about eve and passionate about her players. he believes in our community and wants the best for it. that passion has led him to run for csm so that he might better the game, better the community, and better our experience.our alliance is fortunate to have him and if he is elected to csm all of eve will be able to share in that same fortune. it is for these reasons that i will be voting for him and urging everyone i know to do the same.for a better experience. for a better eve . vote the judge for csm xi"
2/7/2016,"he is one of my top 3 judges, along with dredd and judy."
2/7/2016,had my interview last night with stu from capstable. i feel more comfortable with a job interview. but my regards to the guys of capstable. the bring in the difficult questions peopel are wondering about and give your the opportunity to talk bout them. great work!! thanks for the opportunity!for those that allready want to hear my nice voice: pro space truckers in a presentation for red frog on last fanfest.
2/7/2016,"so, diana kindly answered some questions for me. interview here"
2/7/2016,"greeting capsuleers, i hope your having fun today because i'm not (at work). leave a post or reply and i will answer promptly.have a great day!thought for the day :does anyone do burner missions? did anyone ever do burner missions? i think it was a poor choice. more challenging and profitable lvl 4's would've been nice. i've got 9.0 and 6.0 in caldari and amarr state for standings. i for one know the doldrum of grinding missions for weeks. we need some more variety.killing your ships and pods since 2008. killboards don't lie, don't get mad, get better."
2/7/2016,"it is very easy to post ones dislike of someone without resorting to petty personal attacks. it is not okay to attack a person in irl for there actions in game. this thread has been cleaned. keep it that way, thx,"
2/8/2016,"it seems nonsensical, but i would highly recommend you join a nullsec corporation if you want to mine 'safely' and profitably. the mechanics of how people play eve in sovereign space with intel channels, standing, defense, and response fleets, pos(s), and help close by on 24/7 communications makes the risk reward options for mining much better in nullsec, at least imho. why not check out the moosearmy? we enjoy all aspects of the game and have great mining anomalies and even 2 ice belts ($$cha-ching$$)! i know it's not solo, but we have big industry needs and you can play in a solo style if you like with the backing of a nullsec corp and alliance without a lot of requirements. the corp is about having fun playing all aspects of eve."
2/8/2016,"never forget, fight for the cause!"
2/8/2016,"now before anyone gets out the torches on this one please hear me out.i know that they already did a rebalance of the mining barges and exhumers but i feel that there was a minor error that i would like to ask to be considered for correction.before they changed them covetors and hulks ruled the mining especially in highsec and required med sized ganker fleets to take them down. which spawned events such as hulkaggedon as groups sought to shake afk miners out of their apathy.but in those days miners either flew covetor/hulk or retreiver/machinaw while waiting to afford/skill up to the larger ships. but few ever flew the poor little procurer/skiff as they were deemed not worth the money except under special/uncommon conditions.so i was happy when i heard that they would rebalance them and largely was happy with the results... the procurer/skiff became small tuff little ships capable of mining in slightly hostile environmentsthe retreiver/mackinaw became like the solo miners bread and butterthe covetor/hulk were supposed to become specialized fleet miners... but few if any fleets actually use them... why? because they are terrible, too frail to survive if the fleet they are in gets attacked, too small of an ore hold to use without orca support, too expensive to make worth while. so fleets instead use skiffs and/or machinaws or their t1 kin.i think that some discussion should be opened on how best to make the covetor/hulk an attractive option without overshadowing the benefits of using the other two ships.my personal opinion is that it with minor tweaks to armor/shield/orehold values (say 40% increase to each) they would become more attractive to players.but i would like to hear other peoples opinion regarding this"
2/8/2016,"well, that's as obvious as the colour of the sky, as votes are confidential. i just wanted your thoughts on the sheep who will follow their overseers. i don't know what you're talking about a ""cultural wall""? there should be no difference in perspective, we all play the same game....and i'm looking to improve the eve experience for everyone, not just special interest groups ; nullbear,low sec,wh, high sec, and ship spinners, i have ideas to improve their experience. we need more people also as eve is on the wane, with in my opinion, bad ideas and game changing patches. i used to log on weekends and see 50-60k, now it's 20k average. this must be addressed or eve online will die. read my platform. i speak for everyone.have a wonderful day.holeysheet1-average eve player who wants our game to prosper. also, csm candidate who would like your vote. check my thread today ps at least if my ideas aren't given voice, eve population will decrease further and it will give me the opportunity to procure all the dysprosium moons. so either way...killing your ships and pods since 2008. killboards don't lie, don't get mad, get better."
2/8/2016,one not need have a focus narrowed only to special interest in order to have support from special interest groups.
2/8/2016,"now you're talking rubbish. good luck anyways. many a politician has gotten voted in with innuendo and lack of integrity/honesty. i hope as a csm candidate you listen to possible constituents and don't have a hidden agenda although i fear you do.killing your ships and pods since 2008. killboards don't lie, don't get mad, get better."
2/8/2016,"uhuh, if you say so."

2/8/2016,"hello guys!yeah that<U+FFFD>s another csm application. so take a cup of tea and relax. during last year i was thinking about how csm is working with players and ccp in general. and the more i was thinking about situation the more i was becoming sure that csm is not friendly and open for common player. what are we voting for? for promises and pink unicorns? or are we voting for ballots and alliance members? yes it<U+FFFD>s not a secret. that<U+FFFD>s what csm looks like at the moment. candidates promise things they can<U+FFFD>t deliver, people believe in their promises and in the end we are saying <U+FFFD>csm isn<U+FFFD>t working<U+FFFD>. i<U+FFFD>ll leave promises to other candidates, not going to ruin their business. let<U+FFFD>s return to the common pilot who doesn<U+FFFD>t know how csm is working, what they are doing, how they vote about new ccp features. sure, you can always find articles and blogs but if you can<U+FFFD>t find all csm reports or thoughts in 1 minute you<U+FFFD>ll get my point. that<U+FFFD>s a wrong way for csmmy main goal in csm is to make it player friendly and open to public. blah blah. what are you going to do? 1) develop the options for better communication between csm members and players. players should see what they voted for. how their candidate is voting, thinking etc. for example it can be periodical reporting or thread on forum with offer and result. result: players will see how csm is working, who they are voted for, and make right decision on next csm about their candidate. 2) create csm reporting gathered in one place. players shouldn<U+FFFD>t spend bunch of time looking for a common and public information. opinions, voting results, accepted and declined ideas, proposals from each candidate can be included in such report. result: players will see activity and productivity of each csm member. and they can make their own opinion about each candidate. 3) develop rules and criteria to assess csm memebers' activity, with members being excluded from csm for non-compliance. combined with reporting it will make the process more transparent for players, and will show true activity of csm members.result: csm will consist only of active members, who will represent players in best possible way.4) improve communication between csm and players. yeah, let<U+FFFD>s bring back the practice of threads and proposals on the forums where everyone could write his proposal about features in game and then csm moved it to ccp. result: csm will become closer to players and stop being mythical group of people who are doing something behind closed doors. i can<U+FFFD>t promise you pink unicorns and everything will happen as i wrote. but i<U+FFFD>ll try to make csm being more public, more friendly for players. shortly about me: playing since 2011 most of my game life i lived in nulls but had periods living in highsecs and lowsecs, sorry wh bros i know about your life only on my friend<U+FFFD>s opinions, thoughts and reports, but i have wish to try wh living to and understand your troubles. i love pew pew but it<U+FFFD>s rare when i can get in killmail. prefer logi or unusual or support roles in fleets had a period of active taking part in faction warfare. had experience with old claim and new claim had experience with production t1, t2, capital ships and modules used pi, and moon mining. reactions on moons and terrible schemes for p4 on planets are still coming to me in nightmares. 0/ thanks for reading and have fun"
2/8/2016,i support this.
2/8/2016,thanks to suad i have my first campaign poster.
2/8/2016,another bump for another member of the commonwealth. do you own a vizsla and do you like black pudding?thieving pirates discuss integrity; anarchist gankers give us laws; and whoring merc's cry then blow off clients with insults.
2/8/2016,"i ate fried black pudding as a child and adolescent. i think back and what i was eating i think of today as fried scabs, tasty though.i'm not sure what a vizsla is, please enlighten me.if it's a car, i've had several ladas (russian junk), a skoda(czech i think), a few yamaha bikes, and even a 1968 porche 911 hard-top convertable...you think a 100mn fleet stabbed accelerate fast? try a 911. right now i have a civic which i like.vote for me for csm because i speak for you, not this mittens guy or anyone else. you as an individual and your enjoyment in eve is my priority.thanks for taking the time to read. at least i know i got mo's attentionkilling your ships and pods since 2008. killboards don't lie, don't get mad, get better."
2/9/2016,yeah...no. you're going to have a very hard time finding a game (mmo or not) where developers aren't also players of the game.
2/9/2016,"and to add to this;i vastly prefer a dev who plays the game they create versus a game they create but don't partake in.hell... most of the features that have made eve what it is were created by devs playing and thinking ""this could be designed better"" or ""people are doing this and it should be enhanced."""
2/9/2016,"or ""it would benefit me if this happened..."". let's not pretend ccp devs have all been altruistic.what ccp falcon says though is good. it's just a shame that's not what eve is. i mean really, everything comes down to isk and isk is easy to make, so there's basically no repercussions for doing anything in game. the dark, gritty, hard reality is that once you realise ships are ammo rather than assets, it's really not as ""hardcore"" as claimed. bring on permadeath."
2/9/2016,"ccp wrangler once said : ""eve is a dark and harsh world, you're supposed to feel a bit worried and slightly angry when you log in, you're not supposed to feel like you're logging in to a happy, happy, fluffy, fluffy lala land filled with fun and adventures, that's what hello kitty online is for."" /end of quoteeve is not a single player game, albeit it has some single player content, eve is pvp, even mining is pvp.eve is an mmo and it's all about pvp and nobody cares if that pvp is consensual or not.everytime i log in, i'm prepared to lose my ship. that's the circle of life in eve, simple as that.the sooner you get it, the better for you, otherwise you will for sure leave the game.if you want to play completely risk averse in 100% security, then maybe you should choose a single player game like x3- albion prelude, because eve is not that kind of game.and albeit i'm a hs industrialist myself,i would for sure quit the game, if one day i log in and i would know there is not even the slightest danger anymore in hs, because that's not what i'm paying monthly fees for.if eve goes the risk averse carebear way, i'm outta here, that's for sure!"
2/9/2016,"umm, no. the flimsiness of the hulk/covetor is very much intended. they are suppose to be vulnerable and require attention to use safely, as well as a support fleet, so buffing that so they can be used solo is counter-productive and devalues the other ships. that said, if they are not being used enough, then they should have their strengths buffed. a 40% (or whatever) buff to yield (or a corresponding reduction in yield of the other two classes, or a combination of both) would not be out of place. it would make the hulk/covetor more attractive, but still force a trade-off on the miner to choose yield over defense and the ability to operate alone. but only ccp has numbers on the relative use of these ships. it's true i see more skiffs than anything else these days, but perhaps that is not representative of the total use of the various mining ships and i do see all of the sub-cap mining ships being used to some extent (although i have yet to see an endurance). i am not sure there is even a problem to be honest."
2/9/2016,i can assure you that plenty of players are using hulks.
2/9/2016,"that is actually good to hear, while i have been playing for a while i am not so bold as to think my sampling of people to interact with in any way is an accurate gauge of the total eve population.so i would instead like to shift then to a question of how best to employ covetor/hulks?they do not seem capable of reasonable solo mining, and seem too fragile for comfort in many potential uses that i can think of aside from mining deep in hisec where concord responds the fastest.even with an orca supported fleet mining activity based on bonuses and such i have trouble seeing where 2 hulks would serve better than 3 machinaw or their respective t1 versions by comparison.perhaps you can shed some light on this for me, because right now i am hard pressed to find any reason to use my hulk where the benefit even remotely offsets risking the ship."
2/9/2016,"as a long time null sec resident, diplo and role player, i fully support fafer's bid for csm"

2/9/2016,"+1 would recommend. excellent transaction!j/k fafer love ya man, gluck!"
2/9/2016,"greetings comrades!my name is niko lorenzio, also known as nikolai vodkov (founder of pro synergy) and valkyrie d<U+FFFD>ark. i am not a widely known name in eve, i do not have a backing of a large nullsec bloc and i don<U+FFFD>t really have a presence in the eve media. i do however have the experience, passion and understanding of eve which i believe you may find useful in representing you in csm xi.in the interest of your time i<U+FFFD>m going to post a summary of my beliefs and opinions below. if you would like me to elaborate my thoughts on a specific subject, please do not hesitate to ask either here or by contacting me in person. what is the csm and why it matters more than anything else, i see csm as players<U+FFFD> ambassadors to ccp. csm<U+FFFD>s small size allows us to have ongoing, intimate, back and forth discussion with members of ccp. i believe this is the main strength of the csm and cannot be substituted by less personal feedback channels like forums, reddit, etc. why will you be an effective csm member? i have the experience and knowledge to contribute to the discussions.i have the passion to dedicate myself to the csm for the entire term.i am patient, honest and a teamplayer which would help with holding dialogue with csm and ccp.i can see and analyze an issue from many different angles.i can detach my personal interests from discussions as i have a broad perspective and tend to view things on a macrolevel. who/what do i represent i<U+FFFD>m not running to represent any particular group, space or playstyle. i want to represent the values which i find fundamental to eve and its success. while there are many, i'd like to highlight a few that i feel have been compromised or forgotten in recent years.social interaction tools - corp, alliance, fleet and other communication and organizational tools need much improvement. death is a serious matter - risk and losses are important because they gives assets and relationships value. meaningful choices - eve should be about long term strategic planning and choices should carry meaningful consequences. emergent gameplay - game mechanics and features should give rise to creative, unscripted and unpredictable behavior. specialists - interdependence between players enriches the universe and fosters cooperation, which leads to stronger communities. player freedom/control - players should be given the freedom over how they experience both the eve client and new eden. player agency - over the universe but also over the game's development and direction. persistent universe - players<U+FFFD> investments should not be undermined without careful consideration and debate. communication - as curators of new eden, ccp needs to be open and communicative with content creators (players). conflict drivers - limited resources, limited space, strategic locations give value to holdings and provoke conflict. these are rather vague, so i<U+FFFD>m posting commentary on how some of these would apply to past and current topics. citadels i have several concerns regarding the upcoming citadels.we know from past that balancing things with price alone is a terrible idea. i would like there to be some kind of limiting factor to promote competition over <U+FFFD>citadel space.<U+FFFD> we also need to be careful not to end up with a situation where one entity ends up with a 100 of them in one system, making them practically unbeatable. possible solutions: limit 1 xl per system, 1 large per planet, 1 medium per moon. and/or, rising fuel/maintenance costs with each additional citadel in system.i dislike the idea of automated transfer. current proposal makes it too advantageous to simply abandon the assets rather than attempt to defend/evac/retrieve them. evacs and the emergent gameplay surrounding them should be encouraged. possible solutions: have the option to retrieve assets from wreck or jettison to safe spots. uncollected assets will be available for automated transfer after 30 days. possibly add an option for the conquering party to release assets for automated transfer earlier.i<U+FFFD>d like to see more interesting options than simply owning or blowing them up, i.e. transferring ownership, incapacitating and conquering them. carrier rebalance i like the fact that they are breaking up carriers into two distinctive roles, encouraging specialists and atk gameplay and reducing dependence on alts. ideally all major roles within fleets should be filled by individual pilots with interesting and unique gameplay. skill point trading i could write an entire article on this subject but in short, i hate this proposal. it introduces non-vanity microtransactions to eve. it allows for instant specialization into any area, reducing dependence on others. it tempts people to grind for isk to <U+FFFD>level up,<U+FFFD> undermining one of the unique appeals of eve - grind free progression. it is a massive isk faucet (yes, faucet not a sink, as turning unused idle sp into active sp makes it a faucet regardless of penalties) which will further raise the bar of entry and make higher end up ships/skills more ubiquitous and harder to compete with. worst of all, ccp did not even attempt to communicate their real motivation and reasoning for this proposal to the players, refusing to even acknowledge the massive resistance to this change.removal of language channelschat channels are the first tool that new players use to find and meet other players. the language channels were being used by thousands of players on daily basis, but more importantly they were used by newbros to find their native communities. their removal is a big loss for eve and makes no sense whatsoever.the csm xi election are now open until march 25th, 2016. consider niko lorenzio for csm xi."

2/9/2016,"something i was asked last campaign -> ""can you highlight weakness in the game design and link to possible ways they can be fixed?"" i believe my following answer still holds true, in fact, now more than ever...essentially it boils down to me that the focus needs to be on customization, and player driven/unique solutions to overall balance. for instance, when ccp generally thinks of balance, they consider how they can better move us to the right decisions, based on some pre-determined ship archetypes and given specifications.i see it much differently, this game like no other has embraced the very foundation of economics and material acquisition. that should be used to drive balance from within the player base through real invention and tweaking of products in the manufacturing process. more like being given a bag of ingredients that we discover how to put together better based on a more fundamental approach to attributes, specifications, and parameters. so instead of changing an attribute tag on a ship and making the mass artificially some number, that should be a function of all the crap you put on it plus materials used in construction etc (along with efficiencies in design and whatever).so while the ship o'the day meme never gets old, it does always say the same thing...cookie cutter top down design doesn't work. innovation needs to come from those that actually make use and need it etc, and not by committee, but by individuals experimenting and literally inventing, drafting and building custom ships from the raw materials available throughout the eve universe.to me that is the ultimate waaay on down the line end-game, and not something i would imagine would just be implemented, but rather a philosophy of thought driven towards, so that progress can be made in that direction over time. nothing in eve feels like it is mine, even though i may have mined/harvested the components, or done the reactions etc etc etc, at the end of all that work, i get some thing that is the same as all the other things, with no more or less value, and all i did was jump through the right hoops for the sake of it. that can extend to all sorts of aspects of the game.this means moving towards a model where the invention and manufacturing processes actually have an outcome on the ship, and that is where numbers tweaking and modifications happen by the players. eve has done a remarkable job at creating a market and economic system based on player based manufacturing.essentially it requires a different mentality, building and invention are actually just that. the baseline physics, mechanics and engine are all that are really needed, ship modules and composition along with various choices in building would provide the customization and performance balance on a daily basis by the players really inventing blueprints, and making manufacturing choices when executing a build.that is essentially the tldr, though i have said it better elsewhere..."

2/9/2016,"good morning capsuleers on this february 9th 2016.my topic today is ganking. i was convo'd by someone asking me whether i support ganking. i have always had a pod popping toon based in perimeter who ganks autopilot pods. it can be good fun and can really tick someone off. i did this even before implants were displayed on killmails, so you would have to judge it's worth by hate mail you received.on the flip side, i've tried the tornado and hauler gank and scoop technique in amarr. it can be very profitable and fun. i haven't had that much success but one time a hauler i popped gave me 1.3 billion in loot.i've never taken part in a freighter gank but have watched many. people just need to haul less so you're not such a juicy target. i wouldn't want to say i am a pioneer of ganking, but code definitely perfected the art.i know also the sting of being ganked. why, just this weekend i was writing on the forums and had one of my toons on the uedama gate in sivala. while writing i looked over to see my guardian in structure then pop. at least i got the pod out (mid grade slaves phew). i know there are 2 sides on this but i think ganking has become an integral part of eve and players must take precautions to avoid monetary loss.killing your ships and pods since 2008. killboards don't lie, don't get mad, get better."
2/9/2016,"i fight in lowsec/nullsec. i oppose jump fatigue. i'm anti-goon/cfc. i support changes that make the economy better (e.g. removing fatigue to promote large-scale capital warfare); i oppose changes that make the economy worse (e.g. ratting buffs that increase inflation).i oppose parts of fozziesov, but see benefits in what some smaller alliances have been able to do. i absolutely oppose jump fatigue on jump freighters/rorquals and on any industrial ship being bridged. i believe geography for regions and pirate factions should matter more than how many r64s you can control and how profitable escalations are."

2/10/2016,"while i don't support an increase of hulk and covetor tank for the reasons given by earlier posters i do agree that there is an inbalance in the numbers of different types of mining ships in use.... in highsec. its certainly possible that the hulks and covetors are mainstays in null. my experience there is low but i have noticed an occasional large covetor fleet in providence while passing though. (obviously, to a player like myself, seeing a giant covetor fleet brings on the same reaction as going into a golden corral.) however, in highsec, its all skiff and procurers with the occasional retriever, the somewhat rarer hulk and the less-seen-than-bigfoot covetor. usually when the eve community makes an overwhelming choice for one platform that platform is due for a nerf (see drakes and hurricanes). however, it can be done with buffing.... now, carebears have always been extremely risk adverse but not more than three years ago, before the ships were redone, there were lots of retrievers and mackinaws, despite their relative gankability. this reflected the state of ganking at the time but also the calculation of mining efficiency versus tank. this leads to what my actual point is. its not that the covetors and hulks have too little tank, its that the procurers and skiffs are too productive relative to their less tanky bretheren. so, maybe instead of making the cov/hulk safer, they make the proc/skiff less productive (or if you prefer buffs, make the other mining ships more productive and leave the mining battleships where they are). then there is a real tradeoff. a miner could sit safely in his procurer and watch a more daring competitor melt the ice away at a much faster pace. a safe carebear is a happy carebear but to some miners the loss of income would matter and they would use some of the other ships,. i realize the self-serving nature of incentivizing miners to get out of procurers and skiffs but anyone who visits a highsec ice field can see in an instant that there is no variety of choice among the miners. no tradeoffs, no calculations, just an attempt at safety (and with it afk mining, silent local chat and general non-interadtion). thats bad.tldr: the massive over representation of procurers and skiffs in highsec mining is proof that there is an unbalance and it should be addressed. by buffing if possible, by nerfing if necessary. by choosing to mine in new order systems, highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct. www.minerbumping.com"
2/10/2016,"hello all,i don't know if this has been suggested before. but i believe it would be nice to have your character's standing with npc corporations / falcuties in eve gate. similar to how you can see your skills. since standings are used for multiple things in the eve universe.i know for one would use it constantly since i do most of my calculations and dealings while i am at work. and can't log into the game during that time. what do you believe?any feedback would be much appreciated."

2/11/2016,hulks are intended to be used in group operations. having a dedicated hauler makes using hulks worthwhile. you can also mine into freight containers.
2/11/2016,"as i mentioned during my interview, if i am elected i plan to establish communication channels with those players that have voted for me. i would ask ccp to create a mailing list in game with all the pilots that would have voted for me, but i do not know at that stage if this can be done.so in case it would not work, and if you plan to vote for me, please post a simple ""i will vote for you."" in the thread below and if i am elected i will contact you when establishigg my csm town halls contacts list to hear your voice for the game style we represent.if you belong to a group whose goal is to ensure independant-minded candidates like me can't be on your voting ballot, use a neutral alt to post below, and make sure to monitor your in-game mailbox if i am elected.thanks for your support!"
2/11/2016,"joffy is a great guy - always friendly, helpful, honest and fun to have around. he will make a great csm member, of that i am sure. i think his combination of passion for the game itself (rather than the metagame), his dedication and drive will help him leave his mark. vote joffy!"

2/11/2016,"if we must have a csm, make sure it has good people like jin'taan ...- rather than dangerous-to-the-future-of-eve-candidates."
2/11/2016,"hi lorelei,i told jin'taan that i do not recommend he run for csm this year. i feel ccp is pretty closed minded lately and ignores feedback. there is a particular lynch pin team, that i believe is steering eve into dangerous water, they feed into the, ""immediate self gratification crowd,"" and they outright ignore csm feedback.i will be voting for xenuria because i think that is what ccp deserves this year.however, i would like you, jin'taan and a few others there to crowd out people like tora. (he is quite delighted if his minions attack other candidates and shout them down, so keep pushing forward and don't let someone like that win.)i will direct anyone i come across that wants a to you.my best wishes,jen"
2/11/2016,"even though i only had a small number of votes last year, i was consoled by the belief that my efforts took away votes from tora's ability to achieve a csm seat.tora is irrational, does not believe in a clean fight and is rather happy if his minions attack other candidates and shout them down.(he then declared one of those laughable wars on a null sec alliance, throwing away isk and believing he was achieving something)."

2/11/2016,"i understand that. i sometimes feel like one of these actors, who always play evil roles and people on the streets keep telling them how mean they are that's the downside of being a good actor/role player."
2/11/2016,"oh, there are definitely people who pretend to be villains in eve but you can usually spot them by their out of character comments.you are consistent in all contexts, (that we see of you.)"
2/11/2016,i am really interested in what these things are that you name as consistent (between him roleplaying and him seriously discussing stuff for csm) can you please elaborate and tell me which these things are?
2/11/2016,"i do not believe his intentions for this and feel it is a personal axe he grinds about paying and not being able to slaughter. this is a hopeless idea with skill injectors, even based on account age, now.he quotes a ""study"" by ccp that had very narrow windows in it and is being applied far more generally with regards to new players being killed or in fights and their staying or leaving.(i.e. grasping at straws to push a killer agenda.) so, he makes a farming corp with an alt, gives people roles and then station camps them?i am not even half way into his mix of propaganda and laid out agenda. i would think so much of this is obvious at a glance."
2/11/2016,"tora,though i would like to enter discussion with you on wardecs and possible changes i have a different topic to ask you about with regards more so to high security space.how do you really feel about the bounty hunter profession and how you might change the way mechanics work now for bounties and hunting to work as an actual engaging experience?my thoughts on it in simplicity would be:1.) only allow random target assignment from a concord agent(preferably a losec agent)2.) allow for full individual bounty payment (meaning 1 person put a 10mill bounty on target not the 2 billion total, by example that could mean 200 separate 10mill missions.) when corpse is turned into agent.3.) bounty hunter is given 'free' kr activation for that target only, with regards of being unable to activate any other kr options, and if he does not get the pod has to return to agent for another 'free' kr token.4.) bounty hunter is supposed to be law enforcement...if they gank (do something to achieve gcc) they get dumped to a red sec status immediately and are unable to accept bounty missions for 90 days."

2/12/2016,"what crying? i use webs with my freighter alt, so the change will have no effect on me.that's not what i'm interested in. with 50 candidates for the csm, making an informed decision about who to vote for is important for anyone that values voting for good people.so the other thread is irrelevant now as the response here seems to provide all the information i needed. there are 49 other candidates out there not accusing someone of crying for simply asking an important question about approach to consultation and communication and many who's statements in their csm thread are consistent with what they say elsewhere."
2/12/2016,"i use web alts too when i have to hit highsec. most freighter pilots do, and those that don't i suggest they adopt the practice. i won't ignore whining, but i won't pretend it isn't whining just to make somebody feel good. i want whats best for the game, not what's best for a loud minority. use your vote to better eve how you see fit, not to make a statement on an internet argument."
2/12/2016,here is the csm watch interview with viceran phaedra for the csm 11 election.enjoy!

2/13/2016,"such as he predominate use of the catalyst for ganking over the other destroyers?both the procurer and retriever previously received a 25% reduction in yield. i disagreed with the retention of the procurer and retriever in the first place. they should have been retired, instead of shoe-horning yield bonus to replicate 3 strips. give the coveter 4 mids and enough grid for 2 lse, and the hulk 5 mids. preserving the legitimate fitting choice, which the major of ships follow."
2/13/2016,at least you believe in trinkets.
2/13/2016,"as a fallback option, you could also check out the candidates who are running on the off chance that at least one of them doesn't offend your sensibilities."
2/13/2016,neat! i like both of those people.
2/13/2016,"wow, extra reason to hope that i make it in. both very pleasant people from what i've seen."
2/13/2016,moving back to a multi month minute release to help stretch out the anticipation.
2/13/2016,i would like the prospect of killrights being award for ship loss and not juat a pod loss. my ships are more important than pod and in most cases can cost more. balance out killrights and ammend ganking in one go?space cadet online - a wee blog about my exploits mass of wrecks - public npsi events fleet - launching 28th august
2/13/2016,i want the csm to discuss issues with the account management page and payment. these issues have become a problem since the release of skill extractors/injectors. i want the csm to ask about what steps are taken to assure back-end stability when a new sale or service is announced.
2/13/2016,"are live events from the past dead and from now you will use this new format ?""engagement"" what does it means ?more love for normal low sec?four way fw when/still in plans ?ccp quant still owes us something!rebalance of faction/pirate ammo so that it is used ?"
2/13/2016,"what's there to discuss, really?discussion is when there's a back and forth on things. when both parties have more to say than 'fix this please'.that's more suited to just a quick waving about in one of our chat channels."
2/13/2016,"kill rights are granted on a criminal act. not a pod loss.in highsec, you'll get kill rights just for being shot (in a ship or pod)in lowsec, you'll get kill rights for being shot in your pod (doesn't need to kill you)in wspace and null, you won't get them."
2/13/2016,you go judge . your the right guy for the job
2/13/2016,new player focusspit balling some new ideas.f12 help menu tutorial videos linked with in new player agent missions!have these videos play on the captains quarters all day.here is why i want to represent the new players. i recruit only new players. not only do i have a finger on the pulse i know the questions they ask every time. lets look at how a new player experiences the start of the game and address the learning cliff and get more new accounts to sub and player past the tutorial instead of getting confused and quit.
2/13/2016,...of mayonnaise.
2/14/2016,"no, actually the gankers are using the catalyst just like intended. they fit it for max dps at the expense of all other considerations, which is one of the many ways to fit a destroyer."
2/14/2016,"fitting is the not the issue for the catalyst. it is pointing that the catalyst ""an overwhelming choice for one platform""."
2/14/2016,i have wanted a way to abolish the csm or vote against candidates for years.how i would have loved to vote against mittens before his melt down.
2/14/2016,"eve roadmap w. ccp seagullquestion, will the ""new areas of the universe"" behind the stargates be free for subscribers ? it was not specifically mentioned ""free expansions <U+FFFD> you will never be charged for an eve expansion - as the eve universe grows, so do the benefits of your subscription.""source:"
2/14/2016,eve expansions always were free.if i remember correctly for example wow has a sub and players still have to pay for new expansions.
2/14/2016,why i will vote for xenuria
2/14/2016,"with regard to your years-long campaign regarding the csm, it is at this stage difficult to think of anything you'd have done differently if you really were a goon alt the whole time."
2/14/2016,i guess i stared into the game designs of fozzie's team too long.
2/14/2016,bobmon has my vote!!! good man!!!
2/14/2016,"i would love to have this, so yes i would def ask about this!i know i would love to see, in addition to down-sizing a stack:1: adding a 'split stack' on the right click menu. the current way of shift and dragging away is a bit annoying imo, plus the pop-up you get saying 'there isn't any room left' is kind of silly since you are just splitting the stack not moving it to another location. this functionality is there since it's in the contract system, so should be easy to make it a general to stacks of items.2: the right click on contracts to 'split stack' should be re-worked where the checked off goes to the stack amount you split to, rather than the original stack.would def love this! thanks for bringing it up!"
2/14/2016,vote wyld...!!!!! he understands me.....!!!! he also has a sexy man voice............
2/14/2016,"overall i want eve to be a better game. it is already a great game on many levels, what can be improved without breaking it?scarcity drives conflict. from null sec anomalies to high sec missions, there is a lack of scarcity. npcs can be over-harvested - driven from systems just as mission runners can find that the agent ran out (so many people asking cleared out their to-do inventory). anomalies build up in systems again, agents give players a ""number"" and the player can get another mission from somewhere else until the agent has something they need handled again.some people talk about more direct assaults on planetary interaction (which has many existing lines of assault such as poco and ship shooting). the evolved project legion could bring in a bounty system where a player pays to have an entire planet assaulted and pugs from project legion carry out the actual assault and defense of planetary structures. the attacker pays a large upfront bill based on the number of command centers while each owning defender pays a fee based on how successful or unsuccessful the assaults where in addition to any repairs needed to bring the facility back online. the fees, of course, would be paid directly to the mercenaries. more later."
2/14/2016,i support this
2/14/2016,"i support the concept, but we should always also look at the tools that are currently available."
2/14/2016,"what are your intentions with how this interacts with insurance?a pilot by default has 40% insurance on a t1 hull. with a 100% bounty, on default insurance, you re-introduce profitable alt-farming to capture bounties.some (other) pilots would be happy with this as an outcome."
2/14/2016,"wow! ...tell you what i'll laugh if this guy gets in.-1 for complete inability to demonstrate respect for different game styles and the actual objective of the csm, this guy clearly wants everyone to play his way or not at all, a great vote for the degradation of the already delicate relationship between ccp & csm.what about all the other content in eve?"
2/15/2016,voting against candidates is usually achieved by voting for candidates other than the ones you hate.
2/15/2016,"mainly ship balance.t3 cruisers: when are they going to get their balance pass and what will we end up with? the original long term plan was to have them balanced to land between navy cruisers and t2. as it stands they not only invalidate most specialized cruisers but also the battle cruisers above them and even battleships in fleets.strategic destroyers: blatantly overpowered, they jave invalidated not just af but most frigates and all of their t1 destroyer counterparts stand no chance. what are ccps plans to bring them into line?logistics: with the changes being made to capital logistics are there any plans for working on subcap logistics to allow smaller fleets/corps/alliances to do damage to the other side? as it stands if you cant break the enemies logi there is nothing you can do.freighter buff: with the changes to dcu mods all ships are getting 33% structure resists including freighters. why does ccp feel a ship that couldn't even fit a dcu should be getting compensated? also does ccp realize that this will mean the anasha jump freighter will be hitting 1 million ehp with this change?"
2/15/2016,minutes... when? read and support: don't mess with our wh's what is your stance on wh stuff?
2/15/2016,they'll be a while. but not a dolan while.
2/15/2016,"got to spoiled with last two summits i guess, with minutes going live almost right after summit day was over :)read and support: don't mess with our wh's what is your stance on wh stuff?"
2/15/2016,i will vote for you.
2/15/2016,if ccp wants to turn off the potential isk faucet then ccp could remove insurance payouts from paying out to a character if the character has a bounty on them until the bounty is exhausted. currently you lose the insurance payout if you are concorded so it would not be a huge step to add losing the insurance benefit if you have bounty on you and such a step would add an extra punitive level to placing bounty on a character.
2/15/2016,interview audio:
2/15/2016,"very cool guy ,always trying to help people in game big thumbs up for this guy annx"
2/15/2016,i don't even care for your campaign. i will vote you if you promise to be as annoying as you are on the forums if you visit them in island.
2/16/2016,"if anyone has any ideas or changes to add to this proposal, please feel free to post them along with your support.dmc"
2/16/2016,"i'm not sure i like the direction of a couple of things, so i thought i'd post them here to see if i'm missing something.1) with skill injection, eve has become, at least for a time, pay to win. a new player with access to loads of cash could be flying a t3 cruiser with all the tech 2 fittings, a supercarrier, or any other ship (or all of them) in a day or two. yes, eventually people will run out of skill points they want to get rid of for isk, but the idea that eve would be pay to win, even temporarily, just rubs me the wrong way. that's the small issue.2) destructible stations and citadels. all this looks like to me is painting big red targets all over null sec for pl to run around killing, just because it will cost other players' isk. that's all they do. even a decent sized alliance is either going to have to align with one of the two, or lose 70b isk every few months when pl comes around. and when alliances start losing 70b a pop to pl, and players lose billions of isk because of the ships and equipment that were in them, you'll have mass departure from eve. in the present circumstance, you live with pl coming around, maybe move a few systems away to let them do what they do, but you don't have to put up another 70b isk to move back. with destructible stations and citadels, you do. because when pl comes around, they're going to level everything. they want the big isk numbers, they want the massive kills, they're like locust: anything in their path gets destroyed.and if stations and citadels are destructible, they will be destroyed, too. null sec will become a barren wasteland of uninhabited systems.and that's a bigger problem.if you're going to tell me that i should mount a defense or find allies, you're clueless.personally, if i have to move out of null sec because pl is destroying stations where my stuff is, i'm done. i'm out. i'm not playing in npc stations."
2/16/2016,"any (daily) summit blog please, from you or your fellow csm8's ? source:"
2/16/2016,"i am glad for your vote, but don't see me as a weapon if you can help it."
2/16/2016,"xavier azabu is a cool dude and keeps his word. +1. while pve is not exactly my primary interest in the game, it's good someone tries to make the experience better for those who concentrate their gameplay on that."
2/16/2016,"erika is great! she cares about so many aspects of eve including industry, invention, pve, pvp, you name it! :)"
2/16/2016,"hey steve!still love your tools and from what i can tell you are doing a great job on the csm!how taxing has this term been for you? are you dealing well with the workload (and drama?), and do you have time (and motivation) left to actually play the game?"
2/16/2016,"it's been a touchtaxing, yes. i don't like having to deal with some of the drama that's been kicked up. but it's part of the 'job', so...i still have plenty of time and motivation to play haven't been making as much as i used to, so my isk is slowly decaying, but i still have enough to go out and have fun with."
2/16/2016,i have played eve with the judge for a while now. he has always been an insightful and honest player. he has a great prospective of the game throughout many gameplay options. he would be a great member for the csm.the judge for csm!
2/16/2016,"tora, what are your thoughts about changing it to where you can't drop corp when your corp/alliance gets war dec'd? or it costing isk to drop corp during a war? i understand it's a problem for the high sec merc community.thanks"
2/16/2016,i would disagree with you. you get to put on a mask and be whoever you want in eve. you might be a doctor in real life and a pirate in eve. it might be that break from reality that you need.
2/16/2016,"i'm against it, because that would mean if you're perma decced, you have to stay with a corp you do not like. also, sometimes we mercs get hired to disband a corp/alliance. paying to get out of the war as a player...mmm... neh, to much for me."
2/16/2016,will be on the declarations of war podcast this weekend as part of the round table event

2/16/2016,here is the csm watch interview with bilbert lashlily for the csm 11 election.enjoy!
2/17/2016,"ccp removed the ability to publicly view other characters' standings a while back, and, unfortunately, i don't know the reasoning behind that. presumably, your proposal will be a non-starter on the grounds that it would violate their previous actions. however, if your standings were viewable just by you, that would be fine and you'd get a +1 from me :)"
2/17/2016,"no, it hasn't. a new player could technically get the skills required for a command ship or t3 or whatever right from the get go, that's true...but they won't have the skill to fit it or fly it. they'll still be as clueless as to fittings, how to fly it or game mechanics, so much so that they'll probably lose it to a player who is flying a cheaper ship but has the knowledge and experience to fly it effectively.you obviously have a political axe to grind here, which leads me to ponder how the average player would benefit from these changes...if at all. good, if that's how you feel, kindly disembark. whining nullbears are just as bad as their highsec cousins. you may contract your sp and possessions to me, i will make sure they get non-whining use."
2/17/2016,"i wish i could say ""good luck"", because both of you are good people and good devs. but the csm idea is fundamentally broken:players want to win, so whatever feedback they give serves only one purpose, to facilitate changes that helps them win and make others lose. and of course they'll keep leaking because early information means fast adaptation (and trillions on the market). while engaging with a limited selection of players on the forum to decrease the noise-signal ratio would be good, the csm cannot be salvaged. especially after the document of shame where they united in their will to remove wars and rat forever in safety - and ccp accepted their feedback.i will keep boycotting the csm elections and call everyone listening to me to do the same."
2/17/2016,"there really aren't enough good things to say about joffy. he has many great qualities (including his insane love for this game) but i think the one that will be most useful for him as a csm member would be the fact that he's one of the most level headed people you will ever meet.he knows this game inside and out and he's one hell of a solo pvper. he's the gold standard in st-fr. :)i think his platform is one that is easily overlooked. i think he will be able to help bring great insight to ccp for how to make the game more accessible for people with some manner of disability.plus, he's cool!all my votes go to joffy."
2/17/2016,thanks quitrix. you know that i almost never rat anyway (check out my killboard). however pve is important to the game because it can often lead to pvp.
2/17/2016,vic has a deep working knowledge of the game and a passion for explaining and teaching.vote vic!
2/17/2016,here is the csm watch interview with chiimera for the csm 11 election.enjoy!
2/17/2016,"hi dotoo foopls can i ask if you think it would be a viable request to ccp to allow single player ships who are out and about in null, low or high trying to enjoy parts of them game not involving pvp or wanting to engage in pvp at that time to have one evac mod, or ability to use once every 24 hours or 48 hours for example so when a gank group turn up to just destroy your ship when you have no chance of figthting back you at least have the option like i said above to use an evac that instantly warp your ship back to a safe spot/home station - be like a jump clone but for ships.i know so many ppl who get fed up with the game and stop playing because they were out trying to enjoy other elements of the game and then lose 2-3 ships in 1-2 days or even just a few hours because they just keep gettig ganked while trying to enjoy something in the game instead of pvp,ing.i truly belive you should have one chance every now and again to evade a gank group even if the ability can only be used once a week (although i believe it should be more like once every 24-48 hours) if the pilot decides to go out again with their ship after using the evac then its there decision then to risk losing their ship while not being prepared or wanting to pvp in the ship they are in.please let me know your thoughts on thisp.s i also belive you should be able to use this ability if you are completely solo - so not in a fleet or a group with your friend - you must be playing solo to use this ability. it could be rig you can fit or module or just a new ability added to all ships. anyway these all just a variety of suggestions regarding this one topic on evac'ing your ship to safety.thanksdravenhawk"
2/18/2016,"20 k people dont log in in the peak because they dont need to. they have a lot of plex stashed and a lot of skills in skillqueue. maybe they will come back now, while you can inject more sp, so they will not have to wait until carrier lvl 5 completes.

2/18/2016,"i hate to dig this here out of the woodshed, but in case this point wasn't already made:- gratuitious violence in high security space is actually good for the economy - destruction of ships creates more demand for ships/replacement modules - destruction of ships causes more mineral consumption which drives up market prices - destruction of ships causes those involved in the market to be more profitablewhat can be deduced from the above is that most industrial type pilots are involved with markets, as they have to buy/sell/trade/build/harvest/etc. with that said, they will be more competitive with these activities. what can also be deduced is:- the ones crying about being suicide ganked likely are afk mining- the ones crying about being suicide ganked likely are fit for yield as opposed to having any tank on their ships- the ones crying about being suicide ganked likely don't consider using siege warfare mods/logi/securityfurthermore, the ones complaining about suicide ganks the most are the ones that don't realize:- high security is just that, high security, not absolute security- undocking your ship is consenting to pvp, whether wanted or not- combat in high security is not going away (consensual, war or otherwise)- preying on the weak is an acceptable tactic (see: asset denial/route denial)so, with that, if it really hurts your delicate sensitivities that badly:- show us on the doll where the gankers touched you- give me your stuff- enter biomass queue over i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
2/18/2016,"so...when did the first nerfs to hs ganking take place....when did the trend in players online start going down? granted, not proof the coincidence of these two things would indeed be suggestive....if there is a coincidence."

2/18/2016,"something to consider is wis stands currently as a testament to the eve community being promised something, and then the rug being violently snatched away due to the moaning/crying/p***ing/b****ing of a group which while large in numbers, does not fully represent the eve demographic, the community at large, or anyone other than their own interests. yes, the microtransaction thing when represented as p2w was bad. however, this is exactly why the older players are leaving, are jaded, or have not faith in anything said about new features. presented features need to be completed, as the playerbase will not have any faith in the continuation of eve, and more will unsub.there's my two bits.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."

2/18/2016,"good luck brad. hope all goes well for you. i look forward to being in contact with you again as i've recently returned to eve. i miss wh days. perhaps part of your csm representation could be some sort of order or unification of jove/sleeper/drifter and amarr/merc/jamyl lore compilation, as it seems all very diluted and is related to wh anoikis space. i know your focus is pvp but eve lore is so overlooked. it's sad, such a rich canvas covering such an expanse and year after year it's white washed or a dog biscuit is given to us when there an 8 course meal to be had. anywho you'll have my vote and perhaps we can fly together in the future again."
2/19/2016,"the catalyst was chosen as the primary gank ship because it had the ability to sacrifice everything else for dps. it combined this with a low training threshold and low expense to make it a suitable choice for early new order gank fleets. since then vexors, brutixs, talos and thrashers have been more and more common based on the situational needs of the particular gank. that being said, the catalyst remains the preferred platform for the solo and small fleet gankers. part of this is due to the ship replacement program in the new order which pays for only a few types of ships, most generously the catalyst. it is also the case that the ganking guides are mostly catalyst based and of course, the prestige the cat has aquired as the preferred steed of the agents of the new order. catalyst means new order and new order means exploding miners and exploding miners means the saving of highsec.... its natural that other gankers would want to be part of such an inspiring movement. so they fly catalysts too. goons excepted of course as they were early adopters of the cat for their own reasons. as i said earlier, i would be fine with increasing the efficiency of the covetors and hulks rather than nerfing the tank of the procs and skiffs. so, to be fair, i would also be fine with increasing the lethality of the other destroyers while leaving the catalyst as is. its certainly completely in line with new order philosophy to improve the pvp capability of everyone in eve, no matter what pvp ship they choose to fly. by choosing to mine in new order systems, highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct. www.minerbumping.com"

2/19/2016,i have updated the second post now to include additional ways to reach me via twitter and my twitch stream.
2/19/2016,"so, basically, we all like this game because of risk - it makes what you do some gravitas. it is one of the few games where bad decisions are often punished, and good ones are often rewarded, where other mmos are akin to the empty calories of most fast food - instant gratification only. if you build it, it you destroy it, it is because you were able to best other players pulling on the other end of the tug-of-war. basically, this game is fun because of risk which is largely absent in other games.as time goes on, players have found every possible way to mitigate and avoid risk in a turbulent and violent universe. if you take the slightest precautions, freighters will never fall prey to high sec antagonists, and your ratting ship will never even be on the same grid as a potential enemy. players have found all the ways to share information and effort to maximize security, and you can't blame them at all for it. there simply isn't enough risk left in this game for it to be as fun as it could be. any mechanics change that increases risk should be lauded, any that potentially gives even more ways to avoid risk should be seriously reconsidered as fundamentally threatening what makes the game fun. there are no accomplishments to be had in this game so long as there are no risks on the way to that goal."

2/20/2016,"would anyone who actually knows what ""pay to win"" means like to reply?"
2/20/2016,"i know what it means, but the situation in eve now with sp injectors is simply not 'pay to win'. you are basically wrong."
2/20/2016,"you don't seem to know yourself: ""pay to win"" refers to being able to buy with real money advantages that are not available in game. no matter how many skill injectors you buy, you cant train hac vi, or double drone interfacing or gallente battleship specialisation with them.whilst i don't like the whole skill injector thing at all, because i think it's corrosive to some fundamental aspects of eve's philosophy, it's not ""pay to win"". it's ""pay to avoid waiting"" or ""pay to avoid gating"" if you like, but not ""to win"". skill point trading is problematic for more complex reasons than that, and you do the issue a disservice by mislabelling and simplifying them.with respect to destructible citadels, i believe you should read the proposal more carefully, individual pilot assets are not destroyed or irretrievably lost when a citadel is."

2/20/2016,"hello there space friends,i would like to hereby announce my candidacy for the csm xi. note, that i send the application in good time, but i have not yet had any confirmation that ccp recieved either the application or the scan of my passport, and i am still awaiting thier reponse on this matter. this means i may or may not end up actually being able to recieve votes, but i guess time will tell.my real life name is roland, i am 32 years of age and i have been playing the game for well over 9 years. the oldest, currently active toon i have is this one, started late 2007.in my eve carreer i have done pretty much everything eve has to offer, the only thing i haven't done (not that much, anyway) is living in a wormhole. other then that i have done loads of missions, mining, building, high-, low- and nullsec pvp (even a little solo, though that is not generally what i prefer), a lot of incursions (mainly sansha, a few drifter ones), exploration, pos management, (jump-) freigthering, trading, pretty much everything indeed. these days though, my main activities include low- and nullsec pvp with either nc. or spectre (on occation), and incursions. in that context many may know me as either martha hamster or truus demier, an fc for the incursion community called ""the valhalla project"", or tvp for short. i have also flown with quite a few others, though :dmy eve carreer has taken me through many interesting places and has lead me to meet many interesting people. i have seen the way people react to changes made by ccp, and this has lead me to believe that no change made by ccp is truely likely to do what they intend it to do. that is the most important reason i say that any change should effect as little as possible: only the problem they seek to fix. the fatigue changes, for an example, where, in my oppinion, needed, but the implementation resembled ccp trying to kill a fly with a sledgehammer. regardless of what happens to the fly, you are likely to do far so much collatheral damage that way, and i would say sublety and a more creative approach is needed.other things i hope to bring to the attention include drone regions (they have been neglected for far too long), some lore-related ideas (how likely is it, for estamel when he goes out hunting players, to bring a rattlesnake bpc? by the time he needs it he no longer has it), and i have a few small ideas about missions (mainly, hoping to make them be a little less repetitive).another thing i hope to discuss is ccp's ideas concerning inflation. i feel like inflation as such is not a good thing, and it is only marginally better then deflation if at least npc-related income is compensated. things like lp, loot, salvage, minerals, in short, anything that draws its profits from the market, will inflate along with it, but if a newbro is grinding level 1 missions, and he was previously able to buy the ship he wanted after an x number of missions, inflation should not harm him in this sense, or we will see a reduced number of newbro's joining the game. and we all like shooting newbro's :dlast, but not least, i would like to wish everyone running for csm good luck on thier campaign, and may the best bever win :p"
2/21/2016,"yea....no.literally the worst ""vote for me"" announcement for csm xi. you're pretty much the donald trump of eve, entertainment for the uneducated masses but pretty much the worst possible candidate if actually elected. the day someone as emotional as xenuria gets a seat on the csm is the day i unsub my accounts and go play entropia universe again. so good luck, get rekt and do the community a favor, uninstall eve, biomass yourself and go play world of warcraft instead."
2/21/2016,"not a weapon as much as a way to punish the rest of the csm members and any ccp employees who have to deal with you. it shouldn't come as a surprise to you, since we know you're a dishonest to the core, willing to join any organisation just to get within grasp of a csm seat and entirely unable to lay out your platform in any coherent fashion. the problems you try to claim are in need of reform are the same problems you reject explaining. voting you in is tantamount to asking for the csm to be abolished. you're not just a joke but also, as jenshae intends to use you, a tool to inflict pain and suffering. the two positive things about you are that you're great fun to observe, and you make other people seem like perceptive geniuses by comparison. @jenshae have you unblocked me? i'd really like to answer your eve-mail, but it's kind of hard when you throw a temper tantrum like a 3-year-old. edit:luckily, the csm doesn't have enough power to make xenuria a problem. had it been like other elected assemblies, you'd be right, but ccp controls so many things around csm, that what the csm really has is ease of access, information and a name-tag, from there they have to make their arguments count. that's why some csm members can be effective while others aren't, and why xenuria won't be much more than an empty seat with a microphone wired up, bleating out insane memes, catchphrases or allegations. all ego, no brain, will get you nowhere when that member doesn't have a vote, only a voice. luckily, xenuria will be limited to possibly ruining the csm, not the game. i'm still wondering what the cfc plot behind all this is, though. is it an even-handed joke on xenuria? is it a cruel joke on the rest of us? is it a revenge plot on the csm/ccp employees? or a scheme to get the csm abolished? time will tell."

2/21/2016,here is the csm watch interview with aryth for the csm 11 election.enjoy!
2/21/2016,"after listening to his interview on csm watch aryth is by far one of the best if not the best candidate so far that i see running for csm.in my professional life i deal with the final say on hiring individuals on a regional basis and you learn to spot certain traits in an interview. there are a few things that stand out with aryth that puts him miles ahead of any other candidate.1. an understanding of what the job entails.2. a realistic view of what the csm is and has evolved into.3. knowledge about the game as a whole and the simple/complex devices that fit in the game.4. thought out and realistic goals of how to keep eve alive and growing instead of stagnating.whatever your opinions of goons are, there is one fact that cannot be disputed. they have knowledgeable players and know how to get work done when it comes to the game we all love.put aside all of the political bias and vote with your head instead of your emotions. vote aryth"
2/21/2016,"policy platform preannouncement announcementhi! i am edeity.8 year eve veteran, null, wormholes, but mostly low sec and faction war. i am one of the 2 candidates running from the faction war alliance - local is primary, most famous for our key cultural driving force, dirt n glitter.look forward to my campaigns video, a lot of propoganda posters and interviews and discussions on various eve social media.not being part of a large voting bloc, i need your vote, and it does matter. this is a serious campaign from someone who loves eve and knows it very, perhaps too well.there is much to fix, including the csm itself. not all of it is achievable in a single term.details of my platform will be posted once the official list of candidates is up from ccp and you can watch my video with some catchy tunes and irl interviews of some low sec personalities, my kids talking about eve (not fans), and maybe my dog.until then, please research the candidates and consider who will best represent transforming the csm, represents your interests beyond changing a few moduls or ship bonuses, and who can influence real change.good luck everyone. eve needs you to help make it better in this election."
2/22/2016,"what ******* game are you playing wherein 40% is a minor tweak?tell me. i find this fascinating. you know, with innate hull resists becoming a thing, maybe catalysts need a minor tweak to their dps? say, +40%?"
2/22/2016,"well, it isn't strictly ""pay to win"" as a lot of games deploy it, but you can spend money to boost a character to far greater capability than even someone who has been training for years simply by spending enough money.granted this is probably a temporary thing, as people make money from selling sp they don't use anymore, so that's why it was only minor.and even if items can be retrieved, who is going to spend 70b isk to put up a citidel just to see it destroyed by some overwhelming force passing through in a couple of months? this is effectively a return to large blobs controlling space."
2/22/2016,with your admission that you are wrong and have basically no idea what you're on about... ...i think we can all safely agree that the best thing for you to do to save a little bit of face would be to publicly apologise for your senseless waste of electrons in this thread!
2/22/2016,"a month ago, a new player with loads of cash could go to the character bazaar, buy a high-sp pilot, and be flying a supercarrier in a day or two. i'm not overly fond of skill injectors, but nothing fundamental has changed in this particular regard."
2/22/2016,"well it kind of has, but eh, whatever, ccp need the money to direly to accept any argument that doesn't involve things being nuked from orbit. there are better battles to fight."
2/22/2016,i am sorry that you feel so negatively about me.
2/22/2016,"you could potentially fix that, you know."
2/22/2016,"actually, when a delusion is strong enough no amount of effort can uproot it. i would direct you to the famous example the 3 christs of ypsilanti. this is why i have been prioritizing legitimate questions and concerns."
2/22/2016,"true, which is why i don't expect you to ever deserve a vote outside trolls or 'punishers', but still, it's possible in principle. it's almost cute that you think so. i haven't seen you respond to any hard question with anything but vagueness, misdirection, obfuscation, insult or claim of conspiracy, and you've barely responded even to easy questions, such as appeals to expand on your platform by what looks like potential voters. i'm quite amused by your antics, both because your arguments are so insane and poor that the only thing you realistically could accomplish on the csm is having it shut down (and if i am to believe your co-goon sion, that won't change much), and because it's actually hilarious. i've been following or participating in various political campaigns for close to 10 years now, and yours is the greatest combination ever of delusions, martyrdom syndromes, messiah complexes and total incompetence. you're the best kind of political entertainment. it's all the joys of watching a campaign of conspiracy nuts, added with the excitement that they might get in (granted, a position on which i've changed my mind after seeing how little power the csm has), but minus the fear of them mucking it all up. it's like certain us candidates, just virtual and without consequences. please do continue. you never cease to amuse and amaze me."
2/22/2016,i will fully be supporting bobmon in his endevorsgood luckpantsufan army exec
2/22/2016,"hi borat. thanks for the questions and support. i will look at your thread as well.1. yes, with csm watch and eve nt. they haven't published them yet. i did them about a week ago.2. wormholes need new content for pre-existing c1-c6, new ""frostline""-style beacon sites, and a revamp of some sites like old sleeper relic sites. the ""new"" systems that they recently added (like the drifter wormholes) should be better connected to the pre-existing c1s-c5s. some of us have been grinding the same sites for years.what do i mean by ""new""? it ties in to my feelings about eve missions. we need more options other than just ""kill as many sleepers as possible"". i wouldn't mind having multiple factions to shoot at in wormholes, such as soe, drifter-lite, etc., 3. one of my favorite experiences in eve was getting pvp by using statics and rolling holes until we'd get one with a decent null exit. this became slightly more difficult last year. (took more scanning and rolling).to be honest i did not appreciate the ""stealth"" changes that benefitted defensive nullsec groups and prevented some groups from third partying. i like the idea of limiting the null holes' sizes in some way to limit huge sub cap fleets from bypassing regions. but the holes should benefit small gangs. i'd love to see say time-limited holes that force groups to bring along a ship with probes fitted.i hope that helps."
2/22/2016,"carebears unite and vote for tora. you need someone with an evil streak to rid us of a greater evil: codies!!!! tora has promised to kick these gankers teeth in, no more steak dinners for them. mr bushido will make hisec the land of unicorns n rainbows nerfing anything that will hurt our carebears. maybe i'm exaggerating a little.....but for the sake of defending the defenceless and creating some content, tora is committed to buffing the anti-gank team.pass the word carebeares, haulers, miners and industrialists in highsecurity space; (stop whining) get off your buts and vote, n vote often.thieving pirates discuss integrity; anarchist gankers give us laws; and whoring merc's cry then blow off clients with insults."

2/22/2016,here is the csm watch interview with sapporo jones for the csm 11 election.enjoy!
2/23/2016,"i am asking any csm member who reads this to please ask for ccp to the newest dev blog on overlays in greater detail. the dev blog that was released did absolutely nothing but raise more questions.please do not tell me to file a petition as those do not help the player base at all. they only help one player and even then are completely dependent on whatever gm is answering it. it is to subjective.i am asking for actual examples (screenshots, videos, whatever) to clearly define what is bannable and what is not.per the dev blog:4 .however, if any third party application or other software is used to gain any unfair advantage, or for purposes beyond its intended use, or if the application or other software violates other parts of the eula, we may fully enforce our rights to prohibit such use, including player bans.i. we do consider overlays using elements of a second or multiple other eve clients to be against the rules. it changes the way the game is played and grants the player unfair advantages over other players. for example, having overviews from other eve clients as overlays on one eve client would allow a player to get real time intel from all those other game instances without having to switch to the other windows. similarly, overlays using elements from a second or multiple other eve clients to allow the player to activate modules etc. on those other game instances without switching to the other client windows are clearly in violation of our rules.so what exactly does this mean? if i use isoboxer or some other software to make it so i can just see the overview of another client, is that alone bannable? per this paragraph, it would seem so long as that ""screen"" is not on top of another we would be fine. therefore, i could have as many accounts open as i want and have as many overview overlays as i want so long as they do not overlap.in that case, how can this even be policed? windows itself lets you control window sizes. if i put all my accounts in windowed mod and layer them so i can just see the overviews, how the hell can i get banned for that? i am using a built in feature of the game to move my screens around so i can make some sense of what i am seeing?now, okay, ccp says all screen must be in full mod, then it would be against the rules for a player to have more than 1 account open per screen they have as they would have to overlay one another.this then also raises questions about how they can legally do this because if i have all my accounts in windowed mode and layed out across my screen (not even using isoboxer) how the hell can ccp tell me what i can and can;t do on my monitors?"
2/23/2016,there is no conspiracy here... i have already addressed assertions that one existed.
2/23/2016,you have a child army and my sword bobmon for csm
2/23/2016,"let's have a csm xi free of null sec blocs influence!if you want a csm that is not driven by the null sec blocs' dramas, leakages, conflictual relations with ccp and influence over the game we all share to promote their own interests, here is the list of the players to not put on your ballot. the null blocs canno't influence independents candidates once they are elected, as csm members can communicate directly with ccp with internal tools like confluence. but with the stv voting system, they can influence the number of independent candidates that will make it to the final 14, via their bloc votes and via their players that run for csm xi under other guises, acting as decoys to spread the votes and control the csm composition better. i also believe eve media personalities should not be in the csm, as there are too much potential for conflict of interests. they should keep their focus on their media. so here is the list of the candidates to not put on your ballot if you value independence. they will be on blocs votes anyway, so why give them any of your votes?

2/23/2016,"+1, would recommend."
2/23/2016,i second you!
2/23/2016,what i see as the problem with your proposed example changes is that this would disengage the miners from the safety in numbers idea. yes a single procurer or skiff is a difficult but definitely a killable target. now the prospect of killing 2+ procurers or skiffs with orca support is a much more difficult idea.how would you propose balancing this as giving the skiff (as in your example) an extra highslot would introduce these ships into a more pvp role which they already are able to entertain but not able to fulfill because of the limiting fitting slots.
2/23/2016,you have my votes!best luck!
2/23/2016,"i've been listening to csm watch and you are currently one of my top choices. mostly because i could relate to everything you had to say! there are few candidates who would view me as a constituent, but without me and others like me, there would be no resources. my pvp consists mostly of trying to evade or avoid death, but when it happens that's just part of eve. and i wouldn't have it any other way. i was bordering on irrational exuberance while listening to your interview. you will have my 2 votes!"

2/24/2016,"hell, i would love this option. it'd be refreshing to be in a dark room, my corpmates and i around a projection table with blue light on our faces, discussing various tactics instead of sitting here staring at my ship and talking on ts. the avatars for the game are really detailed, and it seems a shame that they're going to waste. also, i wouldn't mind doing some blackjack. i'm all for it. most of the mechanics are already there from 2011, when the captains quarters were opened up. the only thing holding them back, if i had to guess, would be fear, and if what i heard about the rage is true, i honestly can't blame them."
2/24/2016,another question that came up last night when talking to friends in different corps was whether or not it was a bannable offense to simply have the entire client shrunk down so you could fit 4 to a screen? there is no overlap but they are all smaller.
2/24/2016,"1) i'm not sure you actually read it, because nowhere did i claim this is a conspiracy. if cfc decides to endorse you, there are a limited number of reasons, and i don't know which one, but it's clearly not a conspiracy. like when they flew drakes into titans gunfire, or when they cabalised moons, or the like, it was sold (during or after) as a plan to put pressure on ccp. what will happen here, we don't know. 2) do feel free to link to or cite your rebuttal.3) unless, that is, it's just your word against someone elses. someone might claim conspiracy based on conjecture, but a known liar can't address that with words alone. you lie (or self-delude, let's be honest, it's a valid option), continually, and there's no reason to trust your word."
2/24/2016,you say that there is no reason to trust my word.can you provides examples of this within the context of eve online csm?
2/24/2016,"all the other times you've asked me to prove it i have done so, and you have ignored it each time. is it going to be any different this time? no, of course not. a worthless messiah-complex (or troll) candidate like you won't, because reading enough of it to comprehend it might ruin your bubble of self-delusion (or not be fun, if you're just a troll). i'll still give a list of links (not quotes, though, since closed threads, character limits and quote limits makes such an effort too much work), so that anyone who follows along can see what a dishonest, megalomaniacal career-politician you are. in this (your current) csm11 thread: i ask a question about your last csm11 thread, that you then do not answer though you quote parts of it and the following discussion, but when i call you out on it, you ask if i have any specific questions. i repeat those questions (and seraph also asks for a reply to his questions), but you ignore that and instead answer a potential voter with one of the blandest answers i've seen in a long time (mind you, politics is what i do and study, i've seen a lot of politician-talk, and yours takes the cake). i call you out on your refusal to answer my questions, and you ask for proof that you're lying (see a pattern?), at which point i repeat that i quoted that exact evidence earlier, but you never addressed it. you admit that you have no clue, or, as seraph puts it, ""we have to vote the bill in before we know what it says"". as neuntausend astutely points out, we have to believe that a person that can't put together a platform shall, once elected, be able to produce a reform (and let's remind ourselves that your earlier attempt at that feat was to literally define reform - we might as well elect a dictionary!) that will work and improve the csm and be agreeable to ccp. that's a tall order even for a master diplomat, and an impossible one for someone with your qualifications. you also claim that you don't think your cfc membership can influence you (and clarify it at length later), and that you will call out any cfc wrongdoing. this is contradicted by your earlier ""campaigns"", as we shall note later. you claim that you have prioritised legitimate questions, but as we have seen, you don't even answer easy questions by potential voters, and classify any hard question as not legitimate. in your earlier csm11 thread: first, i like how you posted your csm11 thread directly after losing the csm10 election, and with a one of the least relevant platforms in a long time, but still manage to make it probably your best csm op/platform posts (as malcanis also notes on first page). however, there were still a number of questions unanswered from your last csm campaign thread, so i quote the relevant parts, but like we're all used to, you refuse to answer even easy questions (and those would have been easy unless you were a lying sack of fill-in-the-blanks). as is your mo, you try to deflect any questions with allegations that others can't stay on topic, and then promptly fails at your own platform and basic understanding of microtransactions, eve and the meaning of words (again, a dictionary would be better than you). i have made this point before. it shouldn't be hard, but apparently for you, it is, since people posting in the thread had to explain the effects of your platform to you (just one of several examples, this one sums up your misunderstanding well when you include the quotes). like what we've come to expect of you, you either troll, lie or misunderstand (even to the point where you misunderstand yourself, amazingly enough), and if that doesn't work, claim ""conspiracy"". in your csm10 thread: i'm down to 90 characters, so i'll just link it and see if you can figure it out yourself. there might be an election coming up in my home country tonight and i'm a candidate for parliament: i'm going to participate in it. that means i might be occupied elsewhere, so an expansion on this point might have to wait, ""sorry"" about that."

2/24/2016,here is the csm watch interview with xavier azabu for the csm 11 election.enjoy!
2/24/2016,"hi!i have a couple of question, if you have a few moments...have you asked james 315 for permission to run as the highsec candidate?if you had a goon alt, what would its' name be?do you yield fit or tank fit when you mine?where do you mine?why?do you have a permit?why should i ask the nerds in codedot to vote for you?do you agree that it's time for ccp to unban jerry rin?tia"
2/24/2016,you have my support toxic.
2/24/2016,"about this, why not give interceptors the same change as is being given to caps? so instead of immunity they get a very high resist."
2/24/2016,"in theory, that is what the idea of non-immunity to heavy interdiction bubbles is. this could be achieved by simply not making interceptors immune to current warp disruption field generators while unscripted, or by adding a script that specifically ""multiplies"" the warp disruption strength enough to ""stop nullified ships"". if you have another idea on how to give a high resist to bubbles that is easy to implement i am all ears.another idea that was brought up to me was leaving immunity alone, but making the align times for interceptors longer. while i think that is a viable solution, i feel it would have quite a bit of a knock on effect in the usability of interceptors in pvp (since it involves either a change in mass or inertia).like i mentioned in my eve_nt interview, the csm does not exist to develop the game. the csm exists to guide and provide feedback to the developers and present information from ccp > players and players > ccp. while i advocate for such things, and i am willing to bring them to the table, it is completely at ccp's discretion what to do with that information.thanks for the question!"
2/24/2016,you would be horrified to know the things i can do with a positive sec status. mine is currently just under 0. but that's from ganking. the worst things i've done don't affect my sec status. sec status only relates to crimes against the empires and concord. positive sec status does not mean you're not a criminal.
2/24/2016,that could be really fun. would have to make a way to ensure the proposed target is actually online. lol maybe it only chooses a target who is currently online and undocked? and also provides their current location?
2/24/2016,thanks for the support!!
2/24/2016,vote vic
2/24/2016,thank you! i definately recommend anyone who likes my platform to give yours a browse too.edit: apparently i fell asleep all day yesterday and forgot this interview:
2/24/2016,"i have just sent every csm11 candidate an evemail with their username and password for their vote match account. vote match is a website that voters can use to find out which csm candidates match their views and opinions in eve, and helps thousands of voters decide who to vote for. your participation is entirely voluntary, but you risk missing out on exposure and votes if you decide not to fill out your profile. please see your evemail for more details, as well as your login info.we plan to open up the website to the public on february 28th, the day before voting begins. while you will be able to edit your profile after this date, we urge you to have it filled out before the 28th so you will be included in the matching process. if you have any questions or run into any problems, please contact me via evemail or on twitter @dierdravaal or @evevotematch.thank you in advance!"
2/24/2016,"done, thanks for all the work!"
2/24/2016,"my candidacy has been accepted, so yay :d"
2/25/2016,"i sorta mentioned this else where, there were several elements that were apart of wis, which didn't need to have an avatar interface. these things would allow you to do activities while in the station but use a simple 2d neocom interface, like a mission giving bot etc.work on the gameplay with in the station, once there is several of these sections then change the interface from neocom to avatar."
2/25/2016,update regarding multiboxing and input automation (posted nov 2014)
2/25/2016,before i continue:
2/25/2016,"yes, as you pointed out, isoboxer is not banned. the only real function it had left was the ability to manage multi windows easily.as far as them detecting it, they can detect input broadcasting, but in this case, where they are going to try to enforce something that every single operating system allows you to do. if you read the dev blog, by their definition, it could be interpreted as even having more than one monitor is a violation. do i think that is the case? no, but when your rules are that vague, it does not work."
2/25/2016,+1 from me too! and remember: get rid of the frigate menace and bring back the good old battleship era ! :-)i don't belive in reincarnation i've never believed in it in my previous lives either...
2/25/2016,please check out my interview with csm watch as well as this awesome campaign trailer put together by my good friends zaqq & fintarue.thanks!
2/25/2016,"ok xenuria.whilst you've been a member of karmafleet, 1) what problems have you had with goonswarm? and 2) what criticisms of goonswarm and karmafleet do you have?finally, i'm looking for a in depth enumeration of your reform plan. apart from the op, what else do you have planned, and where else have you mentioned your plans?"
2/25/2016,"so far i haven't had any issues with karmafleet or goonswarm. everybody has been really nice to me. as i have said before depth at this juncture is somewhat difficult because there is information i simply don't have access too.if you ask a carpenter to reform your kitchen floor, he's going to want to look at it first.vote me in and trust that i know what i am doing. if i do, everybody wins.if i don't, you have lost nothing."
2/25/2016,"good questions. i had a few too many ""ums"" but i hope that i got my points across.appreciate you putting all the time into these. thanks stu."
2/25/2016,"+1 for one of the finest guys in eve universe, both ic and ocly. tho utari's decision to run for csm was a complete surprise (on second thought it wasnt), i'll be the most pleased to have him on csm. determination and uncorruptable faithfulness to truth, "

2/25/2016,"i appreciate your support, friends and not-so-friends alike.voting is on monday. remember to make lowsec great again!"
2/25/2016,"obviously you and i must be listening to different interviews, mental incapacity, because we've reached entirely opposite conclusions.aryth is, i'm sure, a skilled and knowledgeable player. he certainly talked with a lot of self-assurance on the matter of the 'jewbal' and his previous exploits.however, despite his personal relationships with sion, the mittani and mynnna, he is deeply out of touch with the realities of the csm. multiple csm members have come out over the last few weeks to talk about how the biggest trouble with ccp is getting them to even acknowledge you. in the interview, aryth glossed over this fact by insisting that his communication attitudes of 'blunt truth' and 'no filter' will get his message through to the (supposed) right people.here's my question: no-one at ccp has to listen to you and no-one at ccp, barring the summit, has to be in the same room as you.how are you going to get heard, aryth?what strikes me about your attitude is that you're running on all the same points sion and the mittani did. what exactly, apart from that fact that it's you doing it, makes you and your campaign any different from theirs?"
2/25/2016,"the main topic of this year's discussion focused on the role of the csm. we covered a lot of ground in each panel, with each taking a different tact and tone. panel 1 aryth commander aze edeity diana olympos panel 2 apothne kyle aparthos jin'taan toxic yaken utari onzo thanks for listening, go out and vote!"
2/25/2016,"nice initiative, stickied."
2/25/2016,"thanks for having me, was a good podcast. would recommend a listen to anyone, even if you don't like any particular candidate's platform.""face the enemy as a solid wall for faith is your armor and through it, the enemy will find no breach wrap your arms around the enemy for faith is your fire and with it, burn away his evil"""
2/25/2016,"i did an interview for eve-nt, no one else really seems to be interested with speaking to me, i do not represent any of the well known alliances so i am having a hard time getting my word out other then right here. for your second point, yeah i have been gazing at the other hi-sec candidates and essentially they are either in the ganker/war deccer group, or they are carebears that want ganking to be nerfed; 1 candidate this year want as far as to say that hi-sec ganking should not even be a thing. essentially i am both of these things, i went thrasher ganking in jita a few days ago, and as i am typing this i am alt tabbing my freighter with some contracts i am running. i have been on both sides of a war dec and i can see where that needs to be worked on from both sides, where as most players have only been the defender. as far as gankers/gank targets same thing, i damn near rage quit when i lost an incredibly expensive ship that i spent alot of time grinding the isk to get, and a day after i got the ship i lost it. i was broke, but i got my stuff together and went on with my life instead of being a baby about it, and i am much better for it. since then i eventually became a ganker myself, and now i know so much about ganking that i know alot of tricks to keep my vargur from getting blown to hell as i cart that around to do l4s from time to time. bottom line, i know the fears and joys of both sides of the coin. your third point is interesting, as of right now all i can honestly say is that while yes it is going to take more to drop a freighter, a white knight will not be able to just shoot the can like currently. so in the end while it will cost more to do a gank, the rewards will be better because gankers should be able to loot every wreck once the wreck hp buff goes into effect. so there is good and bad here, honestly for years i have felt that wrecks need more hp, so i am happy that is happening, as far as the 33% hull boost that is going to hurt gankers but it is going to help most of eve so i am going to have to say i like it, besides maybe new ganking strategies will come out of this, one thing eve has taught me is you never know.tldr: -somebody interview my please. -carebear/anti -carebear relationship needs work-freighters getting hp buff but you can always loot the wreck, a win for everyone including gankers"
2/26/2016,you got my vote hyde
2/26/2016,"and, as predicted, you won't face the reality that you're the very problem you claim to desire removed. you're a worthless, mindless (and yet egomaniacal) tool, whose only problem is that xenuria is not on csm, and the only fix is to join the only group who can get you elected despite your ""qualifications"" and your ""platform"". and now you've shown that we both know. election is at least postponed until wednesday, so until then i can enjoy your antics. please do continue."
2/26/2016,"yeah, but you could at least extrapolate potential avenues of reform, even if you don't have all of the information; in fact, you'd be wise to do just that, in order to be as prepared as possible if the time ever comes for you to attend the csm.however, seeing as you just rudely ignored my question and instead responded to the poster below me asking about goonswarm, you can count my vote out. i was on the fence, thinking that you might bring an element of randomness to the proceedings, but based on your behaviour to me and several other people in this thread, i don't think so now. i know my vote doesn't mean anything in the grand scheme of things, but it is my vote and i choose not to expend it on you."
2/26/2016,"joffy has my endorsement - i can't think of anyone else who 100% deserves to be on the csm than him. i have had the pleasure of knowing joffy for a while now; we met in b4r and he really cares about the community and it's players, as well as great knowledge of the game and low-sec. his experience is also very unique from most, which gives him a very unique perspective on how eve can be bettered for accessibility - an important topic that has been untouched by past csm members.+5 votes for joffy from me! :)"
2/26/2016,"so, niko kindly agreed to answer some questions for me, interview here"
2/26/2016,"it's a utility slot, no guns, missles, or the like. i see it as just giving it more options (i think i like that word too much, but it's true) - mining in numbers is always going to be safer, i don't think that's going to change that in my opinion. it's not a pvp ship, and i don't think it should be able to fufill a proper pvp role, so there would, yes, need to be re-balancing - perhaps a drawback on specific mods.note: i'm typing this on over 24hrs since i last slept, so i hope what i typed made sense."
2/26/2016,thank you woooo

2/27/2016,"i can relate to your ideas about needed changes that affect me as an active member of red frog. anyone can agree these proposed changes, especially to contracting, would greatly benefit anyone who chooses to take part in hauling, a vital role in the economy of eve.also, i like what you said about liking being one of the non-fighters, without hating the fighters. sure - being ganked is no picnic, but it's part of the entire experience of eve. good luck, and you have my vote! you are the best candidate to represent those of us who choose to be pro space truckers!"

2/28/2016,+1 as long as we get to have carrier level drones . the mother queen just doesn't cut it any more....
2/28/2016,"thanks for stopping by! i was getting worried... when code didn't show up to my thread.i did not ask anyone's permission... well except for family (getting elected might be a time sink). fortunately they gave me the green light. if it has not been taken by anyone else, i'd choose ""han shotfirst""if gankers are around, i fit minimalist. if no gankers are around it depends on other circumstances.at the moment i am taking a pause from that for the campaign season. last place we mined was out in provi... as part of my ""try gathering experience elsewhere"" experience. it was more fun than mining in empire space... which is something that needs looking at.otherwise i mine in minmatar space. less gankers.minining in null sec atm and let my permit expire. i got persuaded as a n00b to buy one. would be interesting to see somewhen... if a permit would actually help me.i would hope that the nerds in your alliance would be able to make up their own mind. i have tried being open - even registered on your website. as i have said repeatedly, i am not out to get ganking banned, i am not out to nerf it into the ground. i know and accept the limitations of the csm, and will do my best under those limitations to make sure that the issues here are not ignored.i have my own opinions about bannings, but without knowing any specifics this is a question that i cannot answer... and this is not the proper forum for discussing specific actions."
2/28/2016,"hey ronuken, when it comes to industry, do you have any thoughts about improving the quality of life for the average industrialist?also, how do you feel about pirates?"
2/28/2016,"you'll have my vote again this year anyway. but i'd like your opinions on the click fest that is pi at the moment, and do you have an opinion on how it should be changed (if indeed you think it should be changed)."
2/28/2016,"the core mechanics behind pi are pretty decent. if changes were to happen, it'd mostly be ui i'd be asking for. things like automatically starting a link when you place a factory. or allowing you to have a list of facilities to link to, rather that having to find the right one. or being able to say 'draw all your materials from this site' as a shortcut to the multiple clicks to fill ad advanced facility. and having some kind of visible notification when you don't have the product being routed anywhere."
2/28/2016,"reverse order:pirates: multiple definitions of this exists. if you're talking about ganking, i have no problem with ganking. bumping i have more trouble with, but i don't have a solution for it.as for improving the quality of life, mechanically, we're in a better position that we have been for a fair time. crius was great for that.there are a few things which need to be evened out (numbers on blueprints mostly), and the structures need to come through correctly for everything to remain good."

2/28/2016,"that is the thing. i am not going in with the expectation to ""get heard"". i can just use the media to be heard if i want. you know, like sion had to and then things changed."
2/28/2016,"dear mr. aryth,if you're elected to the prestigious position of csm person, will you use the position to advocate for a wall being built around deklein to keep the pubbies out?"
2/28/2016,"eve vote match is now open to the publicmost candidates have filled in their profile, and with the elections tomorrow i have opened up vote match to you, the voters. vote match offers a matching services that takes your opinions and views on eve online, compares them to the views of the csm candidates and gives you a best-to-worst matches list of all candidates!"
2/29/2016,"lol eve grew quicker then earlier years, in earlier years there was hardly an advertising market until about 2008 when they opened full blast in the us, in a short time the game got very violent when the average iq of the player base fell horribly"
2/29/2016,"i hate the people that take in a scope of ""oh you got ganked, you must have been afk"" and i also hate the groups that's,""oh you should be using an alt, you should get more accounts to do what you want to do""i have watched people at their computers doing point to point jumps in haulers get ganked, i myself have been ganked landing at a 0 bm on a station, just because you get ganked does not mean you were afk or didn't take measures, the ganking as just gotten that bad with ccp backing is and lending to the creation of elements ""here the things you can do and not get in trouble for it""i used to be able to autopilot in a pod and not get shot before 2008, now i cant even land on a gate in a t1 fit battleship with out getting locked and fired on, every thing i have is tanked and nothing profitablealso i wouldn't be surprised if ccp isn't stretching something like blizzard saying wow had 8m players when players were leaving in droves and now they completely disavow it by saying they no longer need wow subs now because of other games with micro transactions."
2/29/2016,"i am sorry, but what is your point? that eve didn't grow quicker in the early years, or that you look down on americans?because player counts most certainly grew the fastest in both relative and absolute terms in from 2003-2008 when ganking was much easier, cheaper and probably, more common place. concord was originally tankable, insurance used to cover gank ships, not to mention all the creative ways one could use the crimewatch mechanics to flag someone to avoid concord's wrath. it was only after ccp started ratcheting up highsec safety in the 2009-2011 era that the the player counts plateaued and started to decline with the incursion expansion and its failed attempt to attract additional players.now this is just a correlation, and many other things have changed with the game over time, but it is a fact that highsec has never been mechanically more safe than today. claiming somehow that now, when ccp has spent over 5 years buffing highsec safety to the highest level it has ever been (with yet another significant buff coming next patch), player counts are dropping because highsec isn't safe enough is dubious at best. the more plausible hypothesis to explain this data is the opposite - that all this increased safety is boring players out of the game. but i doubt even ccp, with access to all their data, can determine exactly what factor, or combination of factors is responsible for the stalled growth of the game."
2/29/2016,"what a nice whine.flying gate-to-gate is insufficient in that a freighter is a big slow ship and vulnerable after jumping through a gate. you should use an escort or another ship that is more agile for valuable cargo. you don't need to have an alt or a second account, a friend would suffice (although in your case i can see how an alt account would be more of a help). there are a number of tools in game already to allow you to travel safely. and many of the people ganked are afk or semi-afk. and most fit for yield vs. tank. when they do have boosts they go for mining boosts vs. boosts for tank. so poor choices are what result in many ganks.and i seriously doubt that even in a t1 fit bs you are getting shot at in hs.so go cry in your cheerios somewhere else."
2/29/2016,"that's a horrible idea unless there is some massive drawbacks, players have been trying to get control of stargates so they can shut the gate down and pve in piece out in null sec.i don't live out in null as is due to politics, it bad enough constantly having to look over your shoulder for every neut that comes in a system, or the stupid rules placed by corps and alliance that don't want any losses unless its a roaming group that keeps you from doing nothing which keeps me from wormholes.there are groups as is that want to shut down areas of empire with all low connections."
2/29/2016,"today, my corp mates and i were talking in corp and we stumbled on an epic idea. we were sat talking how we loved to sit staring into space. i myself have probably lost hours to this over the course of my eve odyssey, just sitting in my pos staring out to space. who wants to be docked?then it struck me, like a train hitting a junkie. i would love to know how many spins i make when im floating in space. i am sure its the same mechanics, engine wise. you could have some basic rules such as, must be staionary etc.it was a hit in corp, i imagine alot of you would love to know this. only a little work to add it in.ozran"

2/29/2016,"disabled player and wormhole industrialist here, erika mizune for csm! #feeltheerika"
2/29/2016,"vaari stands for vanity.we need to improve our lives with luxury items. we have small and dirty captain cabins in gigantic stations from where we are confined like prisoners. we need to get roam into station. we need ability to decorate our captain quarters or even buy bigger one. we need corporation and alliance areas in stations where we can hold meeting and celebrate. we need much more clothes. we need hundreds of new clothes to nes and many accessories for our clothing. we need hats, jabots, boots, feathers, capes, cloaks, epaulettes, aiguillettes and so one. are you tired of your old medals? are you desperate of knowing that your corporation simply cannot award you with anything unique with current medals except perhaps in medal names? we need hundreds of new awards. new medals, ribbons, cloth patches, banners... we need luxury!"
2/29/2016,"so you say nothing, have no platform and do nothing.well, it's better than xenuria."
2/29/2016,"hmm... i smell a code alt. i just went through your eve vote match answers, it seems you think high sec missions have too much reward, odd stance for a high sec carebear.your regular pvp area is solo and in high sec.high sec suicide ganking is ""fine as it is"" but yet you also say it needs work?for the question how should ccp balance the development of pvp content vs pve content, your comment was ""mining is boring, ganking needs work""...but most importantly was your comment on the should high sec feel safe... ""high sec is worth fighting for""...now that is a familiar moto."
2/29/2016,"i am a high sec carebear - but i also remember saying that i am trying to keep all the picture in mind, and not pushing for anything totalitarian... that also has something to do with what the csm actually is, and does. i don't think finding missions too rewarding an odd stance. i think the whole game needs balance.actually that is probably one of the more central themes of my ""platform"". not being narrow and trying to just push one position to the expense of all others... and that ""central theme"" is, pretty much more than anything else, what is (according to the feedback i have) getting me support from people that might vote for me.yes indeed. pretty much all the pvp i have been involved in has been solo and in high sec... i tend to mine solo as well, and these things happen.i already wrote to the creator of eve match, especially about the suicide ganking question. did you read the available answers... none of them fit my personal opinion. that is why i used the ""clarification"" option to say that. the answers that eve vote match offered me did not give the chance to ""balance""... but more or less just represented extremes.ganking (pvp) needs work. i seem to recall having said that a few times.mining (pve) is boring. have you tried it?that motto i also used last year. it was even talked about in my thread - see the thread from last year linked in my first post this year. yes i have read bing's threads... and yes i used the catchphrase before i knew about bing's threads... but then this information has been out there since before the last election... i don't get what you are getting at. but kudos to you for getting interested! you don't have to vote for me... but please do vote. participation is key!p.s. for some reason i keep having problems getting to the forums. have to keep editing incomplete posts. sorry to anyone that read a previous version!"
2/29/2016,"+2 first choice votes for steve.get him back in there, people."
2/29/2016,i don't always comment in eve. but when i do it's to vote for sullen decimus
2/29/2016,"you also likely won't hear me say ""risk vs reward"", as that phrase has been perverted in this community to basically mean; force other players into ""sitting duck"" mode so i can shoot them whilst plexing for isk, so i never have to become that same victim."
2/29/2016,"hey. sorry for long waiting reply. crazy weeks. yeah. you named 4 csm members. and how about others? do you know them? do you know what they were doing? can you find all their blogs during 2 minutes? 5? 10? i tried. spent like 2 hours. assembly hall - good place for posting. but how do you know what ideas were taken and rejected? and yes, i understand what nda is. but at least you can post reports after something that's under nda is posted in game. this can help to make csm a bit more open. for example i have no idea who i should vote for from last csm council. mostly because noone knows what they were doing there are 2 ways to make stuff working - forum and csm.eveonline. for the beginning it's ok. may be if ccp has resourced there can be added more interesting tools like site with form and voting for best ideas. who knows."
2/29/2016,i have only good luck
2/29/2016,"if i could characterise your opinion of the csm, i'd say you believe it's a regulatory body. how can you act as such if no-one will speak with you? how will you provide value to ccp, if you're only a public voice of disagreement?are you going to be a bull-horn csm then? should i write about your planned boycott of the csm xi summits now, or do you wish to keep us on ice until ccp does something you consider outrageous? /swhat's the point in voting for you if you can only communicate via tweet or article, and not provide the value the csm is meant to? in fact, let's make this easier. if ccp continues to suffer problems with the csm, what exactly can you do to alleviate those problems personally?"
2/29/2016,here is the csm watch interview with for the csm 11 election.enjoy!
2/29/2016,unfortunately my rl is going to prevent doing more election stuff prior to the bulk of voting being over. thanks for the sticky fractal!
2/29/2016,"understandable, just a shame that it was limited to just a very small handful of candidates."
