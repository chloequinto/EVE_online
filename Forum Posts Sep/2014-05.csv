5/1/2014,"ok, so i read through your post, but not all the comments, as most just want to sidestep what you<U+FFFD>re asking for to throw at you, what you <U+FFFD>should<U+FFFD> be doing. ignoring all that banter, i<U+FFFD>ve thought on this through the years<U+FFFD> i like cloaks too and have no desire to nerf them<U+FFFD> but i do believe there<U+FFFD>s a sensible and logical solution to help deal with the afk cloakers, while not affecting the active recon pilot. you<U+FFFD>ve already partial mentioned my solution, to which obviously someone touched on before with using probes. it would have to be a specialized probe, which also goes along with a new technology idea. it<U+FFFD>s not anything crazy<U+FFFD> basically sonar or as i<U+FFFD>d like to call it usdas (unidentified spatial displacement anomaly sensor). the usdas probes would scan at perhaps limited ranges (32 au max), identify what it knows (i.e. planets, star gates, asteroids, ships, etc.) and weed them out. this scan process would take longer than typical probes. what would be left are the usdas. scan deviation would be horrendous<U+FFFD> and by the time you reach a say .5 au scan, the best you<U+FFFD>ll get to <U+FFFD>landing on your target<U+FFFD> would be within 100km. perhaps a new skill could be implemented to reduce this a tad. to be clear, the probes will not identify anything<U+FFFD> just show the usda. perhaps a new deployable could be developed that would be released as a decoy that would mimic a usda with a limited lifespan. so now what you say? well in comes the next part of my idea<U+FFFD> the udas module. a high slot mod that emits a sonar or wave pulse. it<U+FFFD>s non-invasive meaning that it doesn<U+FFFD>t incur aggression. it doesn<U+FFFD>t de-cloak anything. it merely resonates back a <U+FFFD>ghost<U+FFFD> image of what<U+FFFD>s in space. this sonar wave would have an optimal and fall-off<U+FFFD> to the visual feedback. the optimal may be 20km<U+FFFD> the fall off 10km. the visual ghost would only be visible from the pilot with the mod. within the optimal range, the visual would be pretty clear<U+FFFD> and as it goes out<U+FFFD> less prominent. this could be used on gates, next to stations<U+FFFD> anywhere. obviously, if you see a cloaky ship from the resonation<U+FFFD> you<U+FFFD>d want to head towards it<U+FFFD> and get close enough to de-cloak it. that<U+FFFD>s it! the resonation would last, maybe 10 - 20 seconds and you<U+FFFD>d need to visually look for it. to be clear this mod will not: 1) de cloak anything 2) show the ship on overview 3) let you lock him 4) show his ghost image to anyone else. point is, this doesn<U+FFFD>t nerf anything, truly<U+FFFD> anyone not open to any middle ground discussion just clearly wants to afk cloak. i don't care if this would be implemented or not, but i think having work arounds for something that seems entirely immune is a good thing. i honestly don<U+FFFD>t care about afk cloaks<U+FFFD> it doesn<U+FFFD>t affect me<U+FFFD> but this issue just needs a resolution<U+FFFD> much like interceptors now."
5/1/2014,"this idea intrigues me, the only flaw i can see so far is that sound waves do not travel in space, they must have a medium to travel through so sonar will would not be appropriate, however some other projected wave like tachyon or looking for isogen emissions from the drive somthing like that."
5/1/2014,"the main issue is really fairly simple, it is not game mechanics, it is straight up the psychosis of the player, period. the large majority of the player base in null deals with and understands how to work around it. this kind of whine comes from a smaller, louder and whinier crowd of folk that can't seem to achieve the same results as the other players in their respective corps and or alliances. it is hard for me to understand why there is such an out cry from folk that can not seem to pull it together, but with in the very same community, you have scores of players that can. everyone has the same tools with in the game.it boils down to the player behind the keyboard, and what i am reading from a few folks here is that they want a buff because they are personally challenged or lazy."
5/1/2014,"a cry for understanding, is what i heard here.this is part monologue, but it explains why i see things the way i do.actually, these are the players who have no business in null to begin with.since an excel sheet is dictating terms, and it includes poor judgement players, then some alliances just lower the bar for everyone to keep the clueless out of the mix.me? i had a problem with authority, specifically where i realized i was being held back as part of a group.the problem came into it's own when i realized i had trained skills as well as playing ability that let me effectively fight back, if the opportunity appeared.it may not be obvious to everyone, but having a single response of ""run when you see them"" caters to those with lower skill sets.skill sets not entirely appropriate to null, much less low sec. skill sets grown in high sec, in many cases.mining, for many reasons, ended up being dumbed down so that warm bodies could fill the ranks.actual null miners like myself, ended up being wildly overqualified for the profession.we prepared far beyond need, were able to relocate in many cases unassisted, and eventually began to notice the part of the game we like was locked down by arbitrary mechanics to keep it simple.i have the distinct impression, that players like myself are supposed to migrate to other interests in the game.but, due to real life quirks in the way my mind works, i can see potentials similar to extrapolation.i won't claim to be some genius here, but it apparently is a talent less common than i expected.i play differently as a result.regular combat pvp, (to me at least), is too predictable for me to enjoy.but i can clearly see potential in null mining. i see the two boundaries which are forcing it into a narrow lane of activity.(like the bumpers for bowling that small children use)on the left, local screaming who is present and when they come and go.on the right, the total inability to locate the very same pilot local tells you about.if we drop the bumpers, (yaaay for analogies and metaphors), then it becomes a matter of skill to operate in this area.competition can really take place, with some building sensor skills and valuable habits.others will build cloaking into disciplines, with tricks to avoid detection except by these masters of sensory awareness.the trade off being, those warm bodies will be mulched until they either adapt and learn null skills, or they will leave null.gradual changes that include a learning curve solve a lot of these growth pains.i believe we can still compromise on a change that lets some warm bodies stay, but opens more opportunities for skilled players to actually do more in mining.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."

5/1/2014,"understanding you is not what this is about, trying to psycho analyze your ""quirks"" is not part of the issue. the issue is that you have certain folks unable to adapt to the conditions other players are able to. thus this is not a mechanic issue but a personal issue for the person behind the keyboard. the basis of this thread is simple, it is to make a mechanics issue into a social issue. thus you have a small portion of the community that can not or will not take the time to understand the mechanics and use them as everyone else does. they are looking for a crutch because they feel that they are special, and should not have to be subjected to the conditions others have to play by. they view the game as socially incorrect, and that it should fit their geopolitical views as they see the world. and that from their view point, people like me do not belong. as you had mentioned, i do not belong, you want to exclude me and many others like me from the game because i have proved contrary to your beliefs that the current mechanics of this game and the game play is working as intended."
5/1/2014,"you have proved nothing. i am still waiting for you to make an actual point.this crutch of needing help in the game, you have it entirely reversed from actual play.and a social issue? socialization is not even connected to this context.the problem is the game has incentivized non interaction, by making the consequences of interaction pointedly negative for one side in two different scenarios.both of these disadvantaged sides also have the ability, repeatedly demonstrated, of avoiding conflicts where they choose.not surprisingly, they choose to avoid conflicts where they expect to lose regardless of other choices possible to them.i know perfectly well how to play. that is the problem.because it is so easy in so many ways, we have repetitive cycles of stalemates rather than resolutions.just like tic tac toe, and for many of the same reasons.the lack of a challenge where competition could be a factor is the real issue.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
5/1/2014,"proved? what do i need to prove, you carry the burden, not i. the folks that can not cope with he current system has yet to bring forth a solid reason why the current mechanics does no work for everyone and how that would benefit all forms of game play, not just the removing of certain game play because you do not seem to like it. i sat back a bit and tried to wrap my head around why there is so much angst about this. now i have played on both sides of this, doing the jewbear thing to replace ships or buy me something shiny. or enforcing an alliance directive to gut the target alliance. i have been privy to all sorts of forum rants, communications and intel from my opponents and the common thread through all of them (smash, roadkill, bob, rise, cow, tri, bruce, -a-, a citizens, etc etc) is ""please do not be stupid and give a way losses."" it is pretty simple, it is telling you not to do stupid stuff.now, you mentioned you have an issue with authority, well that tells me a lot. it tells me that you are not a team player, you have no interest in supporting the alliance you have signed on with, nor do you really care what the objectives of said alliance/corp is. thus all you want, and many of the socially challenged with in the odd ( oppositional defiant disorder) crowd, is to play an arcade game and play how ever you want, due tothe fact your monthly payment entitles you this right, and the right of others is of no consequence. no sir, you do not fully understand eve. nor do you understand how the game is played in null."
5/1/2014,"you assume much.i understand perfectly well how the game is played in null.the first thing you are assuming is that the mining experience is perfected to the point where all that remains is minor tweaks to ships.really.the game concept that says in order to be a team player, you must invest into an unrewarding time sink, preferably with multiple accounts.if you want 'fun', you must do something besides mining, as that is what it is supposed to be already.you understand that many players are operating solo, with or without multiple accounts.you understand that due to game mechanics, they are expected, if not required, to use evasion in order to avoid obvious destruction.and now you say how dare we question this?i take it to mean you cannot conceive of a better system.it is not within your purview to declare a better system may not exist, however.we are discussing the possibilities of this.if you have nothing to contribute, except for negative heckling and harassment, i would suggest you direct your efforts elsewhere, so they may be a positive influence in another place.you are doing nothing more than ad hominem attacks currently, by declaring us misfits who have failed to meet expectations. suggesting our ideas stem from weakness of character may satisfy your views, but they produce nothing of value or merit.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."

5/1/2014,"this is a delicate matter, as you stated there are many aspects of the game that allows for interaction while not at the computer. on this i totally agree with you. i think the problem lies in defining what is active game play. communication and notifications out of game is a standard set by ccp, (eve gate for example) however how much should a person not in game be allowed to affect someone who is in game. for instance i get a notification that someone is hitting one of my towers. im at work i cant leave but i can text a corp mate and have them go defend the pos, while this communication allows me to defend my pos, it does take time and eventually requires someone in game to react to the threat. this is different than if i was in game when the pos was first attacked.using the above example, both the out of game and ingame players have a means to interact with each other. however if i am away from the game, logged in, afk, cloaked and just sitting while i go to the store or in your case a three day trip, i may not be able to attack anyone but i am still affecting the gameplay of active players as they have no way to tell if i am there or not.in that respect i believe the active players should have a way to interact with me. current mechanics do not allow that. this is different than be getting into a system, cloaking up then logging off for a few days and coming back logging in and then active camping. that sort of thing i expect and i am ok with. [/quote]you don't have a way to interact with that individual in the way you want. by all means you could go find their tower and hit theirs for example as they afk cloak you. there's no way for one to change the dynamics to the point where you can scan/scout out a cloaked ship and not nerf the capabilities of smaller groups to skirmish with bigger ones."
5/1/2014,"true... and i don't care about the sonar... whatever technology they'd want to call it, i just wanted to portray the idea. you could call it predator mode/vision, but having a more active space of players is better than afk ones. heck, i wish afkers in station would get automatically logged off after an hour of no mouse or keyboard activity, but we all know that would never happen."
5/1/2014,"working as intended is justified. i and many others have understood, adapted and worked with the current mechanics and find nothing wrong with it. as mentioned it is working as intended. and, finally, every idea has been completely self serving and risk averse. nothing, absolutely nothing has any shred of anything, that is even remotely acceptable. it is you and the others that have to understand that others play the game also, and to change the mechanics, you have to give the folks something to work with that satisfies the need to push your **** in from time to time. if ain't broke....don't fix it."

5/6/2014,"you don't know what assets he has, he doesn't know what assets you have.mutual lack of complete awareness.since neither side has an advantage, it is balanced.what you seem to be missing, is that balance is not enough. we also need a mechanic to promote resolution between players.that is the missing part.we may not like it, but a stalemate only exists when all sides are balanced, otherwise things are resolved.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
5/6/2014,yes and i agree. there needs to be some sort of mechanic to stop him and eliminate him from system. or at least give the home system the option to hunt him down and kill him because baiting does not always work.
5/6/2014,"and, to promote opportunity on the other side, a mechanic needs to exist for him to interact with the pve player beyond staring at a name.i urge that mining and ratting vessels gain the ability to face off against stealth craft evenly enough to stand their ground willingly.as a necessity, since neither side willingly submits themselves to a hotdrop, i would introduce a cyno spool up period of 30 to 60 seconds. during this spool up time, no beacon would exist, but neither could any ships jump to the cyno boat.the beacon would appear the moment the spool up finished, and ships could then travel.dropping a cyno on grid to a hostile, would be effectively a self destructive act, as the pve pilot could very likely destroy most stealth craft capable of passing a gate camp to reach them.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."

5/6/2014,"yes yes goon i adressd your obvious reply in my post.plus being able to contract and sell every ship in the game except 2 classes is obviously a mechanic created by ccp since it was not always that way.i don't mind using chribba, it is just time consuming, silly, and relies on a player based service that does not need to exist for ship trading.but sorry for giving an opinion to csm, didn't mean to offend. sure wish ccp could devise a system to let the players voice opinions."
5/6/2014,"your desire for a platform where people can voice their opinion has already been fulfilled, i believe that's these forums. now if what you're date is a forum where everyone will shower praise on you for your opinion before running off to implement it, well... honestly i'm not sure such a place exists anywhere on the internet. also for the record it has always been that way, supers have never been able to dock."
5/6/2014,"yes goon you are correct, continue with the abrasive replies it has completely diverted the post off topic.you have accomplished your goal.fyi i was just posting a comment with a possible solution but thats why i am not a goon, i like to free think.i will not check this post again, feel free to continue being smug."
5/6/2014,"i am not a goon, but i agree with him. as eve is supposed to be a ""social"" game that depends on interaction between players, i support the idea of 3rd parties for trading supers. what you're proposing is basically the destruction of a player-created service.and fyi...just because he's a goon doesn't make him wrong. and he's not disapproving of your idea b/c you're not a goon. the issue is that your idea goes against the core of eve's existence: interaction between players."

5/7/2014,"yes... you do.afk camping interferes with your isk per hour, so you would like ccp to nerf it."
5/7/2014,"actually, my only issue with afk camping is that it is boring.if i take a cloaked ship into a competing alliance's pve systems, i get sick of seeing them scatter like roaches with the lights flipped on.if i happen to be mining, i can't trust that a straight fight would happen if i stood my ground, rather than a hot drop fiesta.that means resolution of this stand-off scenario is delayed indefinitely, since neither side feels confidant enough to engage the other.i don't want dull stalemates. the first part of that name tells me all i need to know, 'stale'.i want player driven resolution. sure, i understand i will need to fight in an exhumer or ratting ship, or be willing to forego being able to mine or rat. that's the price, and i should be able to pay it.i presume you would not walk away from a fight, if you knew neither side would be able to hot drop?that presumes, of course, that the pve ships are as combat worthy as the typical stealth craft, and you trust your gate camps to keep out the pure fighting ships.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
5/7/2014,t2 cyno -50% activation time.thanks.
5/7/2014,"sounds good.i'd like to see trade happen at a pos.. but instead of trading item for items you receive a full blown ship of scale. super or af, allowing trade at a pos can be a good thing. i'd rather see you tether the ship to an anchor point at the pos that is locked until condition 'x' is met - like payment. transaction proceeds, ownership changes and you drive off the lot. just a suggestion. thanks for reading!"
5/7/2014,"i thought supers and titans not being able to dock anywhere was an intended feature, to make them harder to protect and care for?third-party trade services are a cool player-created workaround to a combat-related mechanic, not a trade mechanic in itself.taking the inherent danger out of the trade is bad imo.make space glamorous! is eve dying or not? ask the eve-o death-o-meter!"
5/7/2014,"because this station wouldnt see 90% of the capuitals docked there permanently and/or be camped ndlessly day after day cause ""dose kills"""
5/7/2014,"i really dont agree, due to the fact that it would place tracking disruptors on the level of jammers for their universal utility, as it stands, a missile ship is a counter to a tracking disruption ship, if td affected missiles, the only ship left would be drone ships, which i perosnally would not want to see as ""the ship class"" for pvp, simply ebcause it lacks diversity.not only that, missiles see little enough use as it is in pvp outside rockets and light missiles, we dont need even further nerfs to their usability.(and from a lroe perspective, you disrupt a ships targeting, but the missiles are more than alrge enough to have onbaord targeting)"
5/7/2014,"haven't checked -- but why can't npc corps just sell their friggin' planet station? i mean, shouldn't diplo and negotiation count for something?.. and how the hell did interbus land all the planets? even in wh's as i remember. now that is power."
5/7/2014,"one problem with this discussion is that we are are confusing sov null with npc null, which both work on different premises.relisting in deklein is a bannable offense. and most market pvp can get you banned if you are caught. this is very different from stations in npc null that can't be controlled. on long deployments the richer cfc members are expected to move their own subcaps in carriers. for everyone else, there is goonswarm offensive logistics. we don't really *need* producers.clever market players may have some impact on npc null, but they will never be able to do any meaningful damage to a well organized sov alliance. even if you have spies, you can only use them so often before they are caught.production and mining are nonetheless fun things to do, maybe on the side, in between fleets as a substitute for ratting. or while your main is on a mind numbing hell camp and you're able multitask. but it doesn't have to be done."
5/7/2014,"i'd say thumbs down on this. exporting market orders to csv files provides useful info for sales analytics including original quantities for a sell order. depending on the frequency of exporting orders, one can track the velocity or rate at which sales of a given item are moving. resetting amounts might make exports meaningless.what's wrong with more than one sales order? if you find orders annoying enough to require such a fix, why not increase your skills enough to make multiple orders a non-issue?"

5/8/2014,"so as i understand it, you want to completely remove a player profession with huge interaction and emergent content potential with a fiat npc service becase of some bizarre fluff justification that i am sure is nothing to do with you wanting to buy a nyx with zero risk of being scammed.have i got that right?"
5/8/2014,"tl;dr: hahaha no, get out"
5/8/2014,"as of last expansion, i assume most of us has more or less than 5 clones by now. i propose to ccp to allow us to names those clones in the jump clone menu. for example: clone 1 has mining implant. i shall name it: minerclone 2 has plus 5 implant. i shall name it: vacationclone 3 has no implant. i shall name it: pee v pee. clone 4 has implant for slowcat setup. and so on...reason why, is for us not to accidentally jump into difference clone when the call for certain pvp/pve set up. or some pilot may fail and jump into his mining/trading/manufacturing implant clone. when we are allow to name our clone, it will eliminate hassle of going thru each clone which to jump into. and m sure most of us has clone in next system or few jumps away with difference implants. thank you for your time reading this ccp. trouble."
5/8/2014,seen this proposal a few times before.fully support it.it's a quality of life change that in no way affects balance or gives any player an advantage over another. jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.

5/11/2014,"on the subject of afk cloaking. i am finding out that for a select few it is a passive source of income. hence the very opposed views on this thread.so if i have this right, someone has had something terrible happen to them. or well maybe not really they just have some motivation to spend isk to mess with someones else's isk making. i have to be honest i have been finding it very hard to find out rates as an average. i have seen everything from 25 mil per system per day up to 100 mil per day.once a contract is agreed upon the afk cloaker flies and sneaks into what ever system, finds a safe spot and cloaks up. he stays there down time to down time until the contract has run its time.sometimes a macro or bot is used to ensure that as soon as down time is over the pilot is logged on and cloaked.the reasoning that it is hard to get information on the dubious profession should be obvious. this aspect of gameplay encourages afk play. i have not found any good arguments that this sort of play has an positive benefits for the game. keep in mind i am ok with cloaky camping, so long as the pilot is active. i still think i should have a mechanic to interact with that pilot should he decided to remain cloaked.(please do not bring the arguments of docked pilots and wot not. it is rather tired at this point.)mechanics should encourage active game play. this is stated in many ccp goals. thoughts?"
5/11/2014,"the interests of meta gaming, in this context, should not hold sway over active gaming.active gaming should always be the holy grail, which is the primary design concern.that is not reflected in current design, i feel.rather, i see an unfinished game more often translating into a stalemate than an interesting, player driven, solution.it is established and respected by authorities already, that the current situation is both balanced and fair.ccp may not have improved resolution over all these years of complaints, but you can be assured they are aware of it, and have confirmed at least fairness exists.i am not arguing to make it more fair. that is already done to death, and is exactly why we have the stalemates like this.i am arguing to put player sourced failing, talent and effort more into the game.by denying the effort to gather intel, we also deny player skill and human failing on this aspect.following basic intel gathering, on both sides being necessary here, we can then proceed to resolution.the hostile cannot know who is present without looking, and they should be exposed to detection during this period of discovery as well.having both sides automatically reported to the other only serves to make both react, and since the game places the hostile at a disadvantage, this results in a stalemate.(both have the opportunity to make one warp before the other can intervene, placing the defender in safety and the attacker in limbo, which is where we are now)the price of isk should always be constant vigilance against threat.if this cannot be sustained for good gameplay, then i think the time sink aspect needs to be reduced until it can. afk play creates more problems than it solves, i feel in this context.the game is treating vigilance as not sustainable currently, so is automating it.this is creating consequently our current set of problems here.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
5/11/2014,"if proposal to flag bumper as a suspect after some amount of perpetual bumping are pretty reasonalbe for me (there is nothing wrong will happen around crowded undock areas and at stargates expiriencing high amounts of traffic coming through; untill players at least somewhere near their pcs, they will be able to spot their ship stucked and bumping into someone's other in time; some new voice notification could be added warning you that you are about to get suspect flag for bumping; as a last resort, we could just make this new rule to not apply to undock areas of trade hubs at all, or probably to any place in those systems)but i don't agree with this idea about making some areas of higsec perfectly safe. it will devoid the whole game concept of its flavor. well, at least untill those areas become massively nerfed in terms of isk/hour in all possible forms (mining included) and really will become a place for newbs to learn the game."
5/11/2014,this totally needed a new seperate thread from the one already discussing this exact same issue.
5/11/2014,does the csm feel that there is a correlation between the low voter turnout for csm9 and the late releases of both the csm8 summer and winter minutes ?source:
5/11/2014,"as to the csm, i cannot say what my fellow councillors think.me? no.i think it is more that we are becoming part of the background noise of eve and unless there is a burning issue for us to fight for or against the csm is quietly doing its work and not waving any banners. this results in lower and lower voter turnout.i do wish to thank the podcasts and bloggers and folks on twitter who did help keep the election in the spotlight. without them i honestly think the turnout could have been even worse than it was.i like the stv system better because it does pass the enfranchisement on to the people whop do vote. you look at aver all numbers, i look at how those numbers were counted. take the last election where it was fptp (first past the post for those hof you who dislike acronyms) how many of the 'winning votes' actually were overkill and made no difference in the final results? if you subtract them from the election totals as 'not counting or being counted' what was their turnout then?single transferable vote demands more of the electorate, yes, fine. but that is what it should do. make you, the voter think, decide. it may take some elections for the idea to take and it may need tweaking (not twerking) but i look forward to seeing a more informed group of voters as a result.m"
5/11/2014,"as disputes on who better perceives wishes of the playerbase continue to surface up on a permanent basis, i've started to wonder why even after 10 years of development the game project trying so hard to consider the visions and desires of its audience still lacks a solid way of examining and studying it. of course we have forums, and we have these [not very noticeable] links to hot topics or important news in the game's launcher, and from time to time there is a survey on some third-party website, and we have csm as some kind of deputies, and that's about all.for first, the forum audience hardly can represent a playerbase as a whole, as most players spend not so much time here (if any at all), showing a little interest in all the boards but ""general discussions"" or some purely informative sections (like related to guides, tactics, fits etc) while they are at it. does this mean we shouldn't account for their point of view just because they don't have so much time/desire to bicker every day with hardboiled forum's residents? i don't think so. i think those players are unfairly denied the right to speak their minds despite they pay for the game like everyone else.the current method of csm campaign's organization has same drawbacks - it potentially leaves many players at a loose end, mostly accounting only for visions of forum dwellers and large ingame alliances.thats why i think that survey/voting system built into the game client is better way to implement it. by adding easily noticeable, large enough and visually appealing info panel to the right part of the character selection screen which will briefly inform player about ongoing important surveys/polings every time he logs on to the game and suggest to click on it to retract full survey overlay and answer a couple of questions pertaining the future of the project - would be much better way to gauge playerbase's moods and opinions' distribution. in times of csm campaigns there should be very brief and appealing summary of every candidate's program with links to respective topics on the forum, as well as ability to vote for them from inside the client.aside from presenting aforementioned activities for all to see, this approach has other advantage - an ability to reward active enough players by ingame means for the time and effort spent on answering survey's questions and voting. it shouldn't be something valuable, more like a pleasant insignificant gift - like some new booster that speed up skill learning a little bit for a day or two (not aquirable by any other means), or some cheap custom ship's painting. but it will be enough to make people eager to answer a question or two.appendix 1:yet, we probably will have to place some restrictions concerning who is allowed to particiapte. no trial accounts allowed, obviously. moreover, it would be a reasonable thing to require at least two to three months of active subscription to particiapte in surveys, and even elections, to protect the system from manipulations through easly createable alts."
5/11/2014,"there is one problem with the idea. the concept claims to provide some kind of ""fairness"" by limiting amount of ships that can enter through each wormhole. even so those wormholes separated by a considerable distance, it's still quite likely that, let's say, two out of three of them will happen to be occupied by allied forces. and that's instantly make those coming from the third entrance outnumbered 1 to 2."
5/11/2014,"ok, im not sure if this has ever been brought up, but im ready to get flamed.what if there were leader boards for weekly stats.for instance,every station would have a leader boards icon, much like the bounty office icon.the leader boards would have filters like (npc kills, m3 ore mined, player ships destroyed, player pods destroyer, structures destroyed, etc etc) there could be a stat for just about everything. the best part is, all of this information is recorded by the server anyway.so i'm wondering, how hard would it be for once a month, that data to be dumped, and these leader boards occupied with this information?just a random thought i got tonight, wondering if the csm has ever received this as a suggestion or not.obviously this is a very rough idea, any and all collaborations of ideas to compliment this would be great."
5/11/2014,there's a pretty simple way to find out. ;-)npc kills and the amount of more afk mined are hardly anything to write home about. everything else you mentioned can be found on zkillboard.
5/11/2014,"i understand thathowever this would be something in game, posted once a month for the top 5 player, corp and alliance for not just kills, which i am aware zkillboard shows you those same criteria but only kills.see who died the most that month, what corp had the most deaths, find out which alliance pulled in the most orei thought that would be kinda cool to see"
5/11/2014,"there is more to it: smugglers hardly can handle the needs of industrial production, of a huge volumes of highly ubiquitous and freely accessible goods. they are mostly in something shady, rare and, consiquently, with a high enough margine value to outweigh the risks."

5/13/2014,yes they would on a percentage base.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
5/13/2014,"in the past, t2 ships have always had a generic skill that every other race also use. so why does the venture need a new skill for it's t2 variant? we even have a skill that would be perfect for it called covert ops, it is after all a mining frigate that can use covert ops cloaks. just make it require mining frigate v before you can fly it and at least one level of covert ops.this is a trend that seems to have started with strategic cruisers despite them also having 5 other skills for the individual sub systems and i was fine with it since that was a sort of special snowflake. albeit it's not much of a trend but even so i'd rather it not become one."
5/13/2014,"there is a precedent actually, needing the exhumers skill for the t2 barges.also, reading the dev blog ccp are hinting that there will be more t2 variants of the venture, some of which may not have cloaking capability."
5/13/2014,"that's true, however there it can be argued that the exhumers have no place with any of the other generic skills. they are a unique set of ships, thus a skill was created for them which i have no qualms with. in this case however, there is a skill that fits it perfectly.as for more variants without a cloak, there's no rule so far as i know that says that all of the t2 variants of a base hull need to have the same t2 skill. i'd be perfectly fine with a unique ship requiring a new skill, it's when one fits into an already established one and isn't put there that i see no sense in."
5/13/2014,"the collector's edition currently contains a 60 day upgrade code, which can only be used for new or trial accounts to upgrade them. i don't think it was a fortunate choice. i don't think many people buy it before they start playing. i think most people buy the ce after they start to like the game, become fans of it and want more. and the fact that they can't use that code might prevent some people from buying the ce (myself for example).i think it would be much better to replace the 60 day upgrade code with 2 plex or common 60-day game time code, do you agree? the newcomers would still be able to use it to activate an account and those, who bought it after they started to play it would be able to use it for game time addition (or use it otherwise)."
5/13/2014,this sounds like a pretty useful quality-of-life improvement. adding it to my list of issues. keep in mind that even a good idea is just one of many in a long list of good ideas all fighting for the same resources. also keep in mind that some great ideas are held back by things like ancient code that needs to get looked at before it's even possible. will get back once i get some feedback on this.
5/13/2014,"thread locked.the rules:22. post constructively. negative feedback can be very useful to further improve eve online provided that it is presented in a civil and factual manner. all users are encouraged to honestly express their feelings regarding eve online and how it can be improved. posts that are non-constructive, insulting or in breach of the rules will be deleted regardless of how valid the ideas behind them may be. users are also reminded that posting with a lack of content also constitutes non-constructive posting. isd ezwal community communication liaisons (ccls)"
5/13/2014,"i understand your point on this. when i read his post, i took it as completely new space, un inhabital except by an npc race. not to mention if they were to include loridia's take on it being kind of a ""one way ticket"" experience... logistics of inhabiting one would be extremely difficult. the main point of this content is to give an ""expedition"" type experience for incursion size groups that would require team work on a different level with a pve/pvp mix."

5/14/2014,nikk once again we are in agreement. the wanted effort for interaction is stated by many. i have a theory about this. the ones seeking active game play are busy playing the game so only discuss things in game and spend little time on the forums. the ones who spend a lot of time on the forums are either participating in non-active play or are bored at work (like myself) and hence spend a lot of time on the forums.this theory would explain why this topic has many more detractors posting than those who are positive.
5/14/2014,"yeah, i post from work as well.i tend to get down time in 10 to 20 minute bursts, which while great for posting here, is flat useless in the game itself.plus, it is often interrupted. eve doesn't have a pause button.i can copy a post to a notepad document if i need to pick it up again later.i spend more time anticipating play, than actually playing, quite often.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."

5/14/2014,"updated: there is no more special market tax for npc corp members (only left as additional tool for ceos of p-o corps); concept of ""loyalty point taxation"" was added; which together with regular taxes covers larger half of incomes out of most ubiquitous forms of highsec pve activities; no banning of awoxing anymore; new design's outlines for agent's missions was proposed, which reward collective gameplay; no more need for new security controls; for some npc corps taxes could be reduced or even completely abolished (example - fw corps)now lets move on to the new taxation system and see how it and aforementioned corp mechanics reformation could motivate players to try their luck in low/null sec space and endorse cooperation between them.""freelancers"" don't pay any taxes. they are not being protected by concord so don't have to pay for its services. new type of tax added - loyalty points tax. if set by ceo, corresponding percentage of lps would be substructed from player's reward and deposited on corporation's lp wallet to later be used in lp-store by authorized members. moreover, ability to taxate market transactions would be of great help too (though it can be easly circumvented by using alts) ceo of player owned corporation, working under ""full"" tariff plan, can set any taxes he wishes on bounties/rewards/market transactions and loyalty points separately. ceo p-o corporations, working in ""startup"" tariff mode, aren't allowed to change its taxation values (they are ""frozen"" at the level of npc-corp taxes), and these taxes don't go to their corp wallet, they just dissapear in thin air. as it was already mentioned, members of npc corps are charged with fixed tax of 20-25% from all their possible income (thats not a final values and can be raised even more to create more incentive :)), gained within bounds of highsec systems. but this tax will be cut significantly for all bounties, rewards and lps gained from missions in low/null sec space (lets it be 10-15% for lows and 3-7% for nulls, for example). that can be explained by a political course of large state corporations on the development of these regions. new players, as mentioned earlier, are ""protected"" by concord even if they have ""freelancer"" status (and they should have it from the start now), ie it's even more profitable for them to not join any corp at all until this grace period have ended. after that they are warned about dangers of such condition and proposed to at least join a npc one. for a more smooth transition to this new system all incomes from bounties and missions *could be* increased, say, by 10% some npc corps can have taxes different from mentioned above. for example, fw npc corporations could offer more beneficial tax table (or even free its members of taxes completly). as those indulgences balanced by inherent risks of being member of such corp. it could even stir interest in this form of pvp a little. potential problem that this concept could bring into the game world is that in case it will achieve its goal and drive significant enough number of players into p-o corps, this could lead to increased popularity of redesigned agent missions (more about them later), which were made so they reward collective gameplay with increased profits for each participant. this could shake game's current economical equilibrum. in that case we probably would have to nerf down to some extent other popular isk sources (like from anomalies' bounties, or sleepers' loot) to restore it.what this brings to the game:""higher the risk - higher the reward"" as it is. if you want to cut your taxes without giving up the comforts of highsec space, you at least have to join large enough player corp and bear with larger threat from wardecers and awoxers. or you could just resort to earn your income in low/null security space, while beeing an npc corp member and keeping a right to go back to highs anytime you want and spend time there without fear. or you could choose a life of ""freelancer"", free from taxes and any guarantees for his safety wherever he went. encourages players to socialize (ofcourse, this dynamics should be backed up by introduction of additional profits from running your missions with other players, it's rather ineffective trying to achieve this goal just by tightening game mechanics) and create large, stable communities even in highsecs. as was mentioned before, we need something more effective, than simply tightening the rules to make players' life miserable, so they become willing to unite with other fellow capsuleers and engage together in pve activities in highsecs (and probably even in other types of space too; and we aren't talking now about some high-end content like incursions, but about more ubiquitous agents' missions). my proposals regarding this concerns i layed out below.argumenation and general considerations of new aproach to agents' mission design which offers good protection against scripting/botting/multiboxing, and proposal of new group story missions:"
5/14/2014,not needed anymore.
5/14/2014,"i'm sorry, but i cannot agree with this proposal. you're asking for greater taxes pretty much across the board, while the economy is in a healthy condition. also, because somebody doesn't play the way you want them to play doesn't mean they should be penalized. the 11% tax is already enough for the menial benefit we get from it, and you're asking that all income sources be taxed 25%?likewise, why would anybody become a freelancer if they're able to be shot anywhere in space at any time with no concord intervention? excepting the station traders (who often never leave their station in the trade hub), there is no reason to freelance.this is a very poor idea. not supported."
5/14/2014,"the idea with market taxing is poor indeed, i have some better proposal on the way in this regard.the problem is not with the way i want others to play, the problem is that a mmo project offers no benefit for cooperation in pve aside from in cases of high end content (incursions, high level combat sites and plexes somewhere in nulls; but not in highsecs).this is quite unhealthy state of affairs. and it is here for ages, it was pointed at again and again. it makes pve dull for most of players but they just don't see reason to engage it collectively. and they won't until there will be clear advantage for doing so. the human nature is a mistery, nor less :)and what could become an incentive to play collectively? well, either the absolute need for it (like with incursions, you either have a fleet or an army of bots, you won't succeed solo here), or by making it more profitable. there is no other way here. and first one will meet even more furious resistnace than this proposal. people playing collectively is what healthy mmo community are based upon. not only such people, but these people are absolutely needed. we have them mostly in nulls and in pvp related communities - because it's easier to survive there when you are many. and even if those playing collectively while pveing in highsecs would just start to receive substational benefits by doin so - just by boosting their isk and lp rewards, lets put aside tax changes - others would start to receive less. well, it's simple consequence, because those now receive more :). so it's not the matter of who is taxed what, it's a matter of proportion, one gets more, others will look at him and say that his activities are better rewarded, and their income is worse. there is no substantional differences in how exactly that would be achieved.and you completely have missed a point with freelancer buds. they are free of taxes, of all taxes aside insignificant basic ones. but at the same time, they don't need to join any corp. npc corp members still pay some taxes atop of basic ones, even in nulls. player owned corp members still have to join player owned corp (some people have a problem with that :)) and freelancers just free, from corps and taxes, but can't be safe in highs until they will rejoin some corp (with application delay of 24-48 hrs). so it's a choice of some low/null sec space adventure/survivalist, resident of some npc null region, who just don't care about highsecs at all, for example. so npc corp members are taxed everywhere (but much less in nulls and lows), but can freely return to highs anytime. freelancers can't so freely, and, in fact, they don't need to. aside from to provoke someone to attack them and gank him, of course :)"
5/14/2014,"the op is arguing for ""realism"" being that in the real world, you don't have your resume printed on your shirt.if we're looking at realism, eve takes place in a future with spaceships and ftl communication. hence it isn't that wild that someone would be able to put your name into a computer and pull up your employment info."
5/14/2014,"the 60-day code is there as an add-on, and not a major factor of the collectors edition set. it's to encourage new players to join this game. it's working as intended."
5/14/2014,"maybe, but 2 plexes or a standard game time code would do the same and people who already play would be able to use them."

5/15/2014,"re-designing concord's purpose for protection is something that goes against what inherently makes concord what it is. meanwhile they may come off as a police force, or a military-police force in reality they are more of a peacekeeping force that is a lasting bastion that prevents an all-out destructive war between the empires, and to an extent capsuleers. another important factor to keep in mind is that the idea behind eve online is that great industry, and destruction take place within the game at the same time. hence the constant threat of another capsuleer is a legitimate gameplay element that must retain a large play into the game, regardless of the system security, time played or the extent of one's experience with the game. the gameplay changes that would be affected from changing concord would also be unpredictable as the game has retained this core element since the beginning, and could lead to more trouble and disaster rather than improving the gameplay experience.therefore, understanding that the true purpose of concord is peacekeeping, and not policing each and every capsuleer in the galaxy and also considering the nature of eve online. we can see how your suggestions about changing the inherit purpose of concord without providing at least some proof that it would truly improve the game is unfeasible at best."
5/15/2014,"well, there is 2 obvious objections to this argument:1) concrod readily will allow small private war in high security space, you just have to pay some upkeep fees for it to last.2) there wasn't such an option before wardecs were added to the game. what means that there is nothing wrong with emprire laws changing over time, allowing what was not thought as possible before. it is just a matter of another good chronic, explaining some changes to treaties.and after all, concord still retains its peacekeeping role, its just excludes some particular capsuleers that became too detached from their place of origin and were engrossed in null security space's freedoms so deeply they started to question their own obligations to the state from the list. their protests and requests to free them from all taxes as they don't percieve themselves as citizens of the state anymore were met, but in exchange they were exempted from many priviligies coming with filled tax return.and about proofs these changes will improve the game - i don't have such, it isn't possbile to see the future. moreover, i just can't possibly know all the needed statistic numbers and game's engine intricacies, i'm not a ccp developer after all. this proposal was composed with sole goal in mind: to create some additional substantional incentive for people to prefer more risky and more social (which comes with more burden) gameplay that will serve as a base for furher improvements coming in this direction - like, creating more incentive to engage in collective pve activities in highsecs aside from incursions etc. it's just a step towards bigger goal."
5/15/2014,"however, that's also a core part of eve online; concord, and increasing the fees will have no realistic change, nor it will limit the constant war declarations from stronger corporations, as it's more than clear that the cost is not something that those corporations truly mind about, and it actually would make it harder for newer corporations which want a challenge to truly do that effectively in high sec. empire laws may change over time, but changing concord's role to something that protects is much more than a policy change; it would be a major change and due to the lack of certainty about how it could affect the game positively it's more of a risk rather than a direction to head towards to.you claim that this proposal was composed with the idea to create an incentive for more risky, and social gameplay. however, you also admit that you do not understand how the game works from the perspective needed to suggest such major gameplay changes. therefore the whole idea is just weakened further.i like your ideas, and i understand where they come from. however, they are not feasible realistically speaking. as i have aforementioned it would change core elements of eve online's gameplay, and therefore due to the uncertainty such changes it makes them realistically unusable."
5/15/2014,"i haven't say such thing. i said almost no players posting proposals here can know all the inricacies of game's engine only known to game's developer in the best case. this is a board where players propose their ideas, and not a ccp developers' working forums. and until you or i don't became involved in development process, a great amount of obscure little details and hardly predictable outcomes won't become known to us. that's why you suggested to post it here to someone competent and knowledgeable to decide. could you explain in more details what makes you think it won't be feasible at the level of the game mechanics?the concord's logic change relates only to those, who is voluntarily decided to choose so (became a ""freelancer""). it won't harm any innocent bystander. and i can in fact imagine such changes in state treaties that could lead to this situation. as i wrote before, nullsecs and wh offers new frontiers and perspective of greatness that can easly turn somebody's worldview upside down. i don't agree this is contradict with eve universe's lore too much.the change switching off ""free pvp mode"" within a corp is just a logical one - we already applied so much efforts to get people in the corps, we shouldn't now scare them off with awoxing (it still needed to leave some corp management roles which will allow authorized members to forcibly switch pvp for some nasty charaters who start to create problems for others)other changes not so deep ones. they are just slightly shift an income in the direction of collective gameplay. they don't deny solo approach at all.as for my market taxes proposal, they are crap, i have to admit it. and they are easly can be circumvented, too (just have an merchan alt and put him in merchant corp big enough to be able to cut all taxes to 0, and transfer him all your goods via contracts, thats all). thats why i now came up with the proposal of adding the abilityu to tax loyalty points instead. by doing so in additonal to bounties/rewards taxation (which are already in the game), we will cover around 80% of all mission runner income. we don't need to tax his market profits anymore. then again, npc corp ""taxes"" you more harshly, and player owned corp taxes you as they wish, and freelancers just don't care about all this taxation crap."
5/15/2014,"i never mentioned game mechanics, but gameplay. they are different things, as in the gameplay is just the rules of the game, and the mechanics are something different. regarding gameplay, and how such changes are realistically impossible is said in my posts."
5/15/2014,"then can you point out the flaws in this proposal that will break game's rules so much it makes this proposal infeasible? the concrod's logic changes are slight, from my perspective, and would concern only certain selected individulas, and only with their consent."
5/15/2014,"however that is not the case, as concord is a core element of eve online and its role could have many more implications than those you take in consideration. you understand that your suggestions cannot possibly cover all the details, and what i am saying is that from my perspective some of the other details that you could have explored upon make the concord related changes into most likely, issues that go against eve online's philosophy rather than the big picture on your mind."

5/16/2014,"the projection of power in eve online has been an important issue since major power blocs have been able to maintain assets all over eve without too much concern since it was so easy to maintain and protect them. this needs to change.below are some thoughts on why things are the way they are and how things could change by relating to some real world examples.power projection is the ability of the most powerful political entities to move significant combat forces great distances for extended periods of time to protect their interests.the biggest factor in the projection of power is the logistical capacity of the political entity. eve online has made the movement of combat forces and the logistics to support it so easy that most organizations of any significant size can project power to every corner of the eve cluster in an extremely short period of time, therefore forcing the ones of lessor power to be renters or outlaws.the biggest issue with the projection of power in eve online is that many things related to it are tied to the isk cost of doing it. in eve online the isk cost of doing something has always been less of an issue than the designers intended. just consider how many titans were built when the devs thought that the cost alone would prevent too many from being built.there are several factors to the projection of power that should be considered.home waters:every political entity needs to have a place of origin where they are most effective in gaining resources and producing items. home advantage: this place of origin should not be a <U+FFFD>winnebago<U+FFFD> where you can pack up and move anywhere. where the organization plants first its flag is its home until disbandment. this place of origin should have indigenous massive bonuses where you can extract resources vastly more easily, safely transport, and build assets within these home waters. but the storage of those materials and building of those assets are vulnerable to attack and destruction or delay. ores, minerals, ices, fuels, and etc should not be able to be stored inside pos shields or stations. they should be vulnerable to attack, but far easier to defend in your <U+FFFD>home waters.<U+FFFD> this could be a constellation, but certainly not a region.true logistical structure: there has to be a tangible logistical structure that is vulnerable to interdiction. this may not be in the actual movement of items such as fuel, but it should require the transporting of that fuel to forward bases that have silos to store the fuel with distribution points to fuel ships. these bases, silos, and distribution points should be vulnerable to attack and should be far easier to interdict than such installations in one<U+FFFD>s <U+FFFD>home waters.<U+FFFD>construction of significant naval forces was almost always done in <U+FFFD>home waters.in eve online it is too easy to build significant assets in any location on the map. your organization should have a point of origin where you can most effectively get all your resources, construct your major forces, and conduct major repairs.that organization always has the best bonuses and least difficultly obtaining resources and constructing forces in that location by default. these bonuses for that home constellation should be massive. how much easier is it for a country in rl to create fuel at home and then ship it versus digging a well, building a refinery, and then transporting it. that remote refinery should be massively more vulnerable to attack than that one in your home systems which should make it far more effective to build and create at home fairly defended and then transport to the front lines. home waters were almost always a single contiguous area on a map that would expand but certainly not move to another location.in eve online it is too easy to form an organization and move it all over the map. you should be able to do this to some extend with combat forces, but not your seat of power or logistical home. you should plant your flag in a home constellation and that is your home. a region would be far too big for any organization as <U+FFFD>home waters.<U+FFFD> the only way to change that would be to create a new parent organization and plant your flag somewhere else. that should be a significant cost and effort with maybe a time limit in order to prevent a <U+FFFD>whack-a-mole effect.<U+FFFD> you should be able to extend your <U+FFFD>home waters<U+FFFD> to immediately adjacent constellations, but no further. extending your home waters should involve significant building up of logistical infrastructure and defenses in your home constellation to a point where it either overpowers the current owners or the constellation base neutral power effect, similar to how cities worked in rise of nations.ships needed fuel, food, and water. it is far too easy to move fuel around in eve online for ships. jump freighters can move far too much fuel far too easily. logistics should be the hardest and most limiting aspect to the projection of force. the further you have to move it, the more difficult it should be. it should be relatively easy to move fuel around your home solar systems but exponentially more difficult the further you move away. you should be required to build vulnerable remote bases with required distribution systems to get fuel from tankers to holding silos to fueling stations for ships. all of these should be vulnerable to attack and degradation. it should take time to defuel a tanker and fuel a waiting ship.to be continued"
5/16/2014,"ships away from home waters can<U+FFFD>t depend on companion ships for supplies for very long.ships shouldn<U+FFFD>t be able to travel great distances without logistical support from the organization they are in. one issue in eve online is that currently the limiting factor in how far and frequent capital ships can move is jump fuel costs. the issue is that cost has never been a truly limiting factor in eve online. for that reason, jump fuel should fairly cheap, but massive amounts are needed, where it takes great logistical efforts to get it outside your home systems. so capital ships should be easy to move around in your home waters, but take a significant effort to fuel them outside of your home waters with very vulnerable logistical chains to do it.home waters should also be where major repairs are done to major warships, such as dry docks. maybe greatly increase hull on such ships and only allow that hull to be repaired in special dry docks in home waters.logistical systems of creation, concentration, transportation, and distribution were exponentially more complicated the farther from <U+FFFD>home waters<U+FFFD> a force existed.in eve online a logistical system is simply a chain of cynos where the few can support the many using jump capable freighters and or carriers. the most complicated aspect is organizing standards for source systems, payment structures, and manual distribution at destination. these exist since most items are picked up from empire space instead of constructed in home systems. it should be easy for the extraction of materials in your home space. but once you concentrate and transport these materials, they should become far more vulnerable. right now the best time to degrade an opponent<U+FFFD>s resource gathering is by attacking their miners since all they have to do is transport it to station for pos to make it nearly invulnerable. it would be better if no unprocessed resources can be stored inside stations or pos shields. only once it is a completed item should be able to be stored in stations. fuels and unprocessed resources should be stored in silos outside of pos shields. then this will allow smaller forces to not have to wait for miners to be present in belts to interdict resource collection. they can just attack the silos outside poses where once the silos shield and armor is down a portion of the damage is absorbed by the hull and a portion of the damage destroys a portion of the material in the silo. home water systems should have very powerful defensive systems to protect their infrastructure in order to promote the <U+FFFD>home waters<U+FFFD> effect of being better to mine and build at home. the controlling organization should be able to have gate guns and warp scram bubbles to require significant effort to perform major attacks, but allow for black ops operations against material storage, processing, and distribution. so, in home systems it should be very hard to catch miners but in systems outside of their home waters, it would be very easy to catch miners. but miners can mine far less in systems outside their home water systems.supply chain management was critical and was nearly always more intensive in material and labor then the combat force it is supplying.the logistical effort has always required more effort than the combat forces it supported. advancements have allowed them to be fewer personnel intensive but those efforts should provide for more targets than direct confrontation. in doing so, it would make the attacking of an opponent<U+FFFD>s logistics far more effective and require major organizations to support and defend them. this would allow for smaller fleets to have more effect on larger organizations without having to wait for unawares miners. they can just risk attacking a pos silo in order to destroy material.this could also be applied to construction arrays where a successful attack temporally halts production.these are just ideas in regard to how easy it is to move forces across eve online.i think many would agree that eve feels too small due to how easy it can be to move from one side to the other in a short period of time."
5/16/2014,"meanwhile i enjoy some of your ideas, but you are prone into supporting smaller fleets compared to the big power blocs. however, are you aware that if the focus switches into smaller fleets then what a gathering of small fleets can achieve practically the same end result? could you please elaborate on how specifically easy it is to move from one side to another? easy as in time, enemy threats...?"
5/16/2014,"could you please elaborate further on this, how do you think an in-game client per s<U+FFFD> would engage with the whole player base and increase the number of voters for the csm elections? it seems you take for granted that in case the forms to vote were in-game this would automatically increase the number of voters, or at least allow better representation of the player base. which is something i do not understand; players who are interested in participating can always be candidates or voters, hence why is there a need to bring this system in-game and force it down on players who clearly are not interested?"
5/16/2014,"while the neocom is already pretty populated, i think a news link might be a good addition. as a veteran csm member, i feel kind of ashamed at the lack of player involvement in the future of this great game. it seems as if most players want to play a single-player game.so long as there's a lack of involvement, the major alliances will continue to hold the majority vote. if we have this icon similar to the news list at the login screen, i think it may be an improvement to gameplay. i don't think it will affect voter turnout or involvement in eve's metagame, but it couldn't hurt either.supported."
5/16/2014,"yet you fail to understand that this proposal is not about a news link on the neocon, (which should be an entire proposal on its own) but changing the election method in a way that the information and elections themselves are run from in-game instead of the current system. you also take for granted, as the one who made the proposal that player involvement must be enforced, which is not the case.the major alliances continue to hold the majority vote because they do not only advertise the elections to its members, but also encourage them in different ways to participate in the community. therefore, you cannot put in comparison the community involvement from an individualistic player, with one that is part of the large ranks of a big null sec alliance."
5/16/2014,"it costs 12 plex to buy, adding 2 plex into it would be stupid"
5/16/2014,isn't it only a temporary action?
5/16/2014,
5/16/2014,
5/16/2014,
5/17/2014,why do you need additional protection from awoxers?
5/17/2014,"as i said, i'm currently rewriting this piece. this particular part is obsolete now.initialial assumption was that we need much stronger incentive to somehow motivate people to gather together under one roof in highsecs. awoxing was percieved as a significant ""risk"" element without counterbalancing ""profit"" part in case of corp of missionrunners operating in highs. after intense disscussion on other board the conclusion were drawn that with other addtions to original proposal (like new, more profitable group pve content available only to fleets which members are of the same corp) we now aquired this part. so no need for protection from awoxers anymore."
5/17/2014,"we are not getting anywhere like this. no one who isn't on devs team can understand all implications, i'm afraid. and if i've got it right you can't point those implications either. this is why we have this board, after all. to convey our ideas and get knowledgeble answer or criticism, and try to tune them according to this input.for the first, all the concord logic's changes that were left in a renewed proposal touch only freelancer status (no protection from awoxing anymore). and this particular part is just a variation of crime watch system. you can steal someone's loot (""profit"") but that can lead to get shot by someone without concord intervention (""risk""). you could continue stealing and maintain suspect status all the time. and this only happens as a result of your decision.and freelancers get rid of all taxes without bounding themselves to some corporation, even npc ones (""profit""). but can be shot upon in highs (""risk""). again, it they who decide. it's almost the same thing."
5/17/2014,"if i understand your questions right:small fleets:smaller fleets shouldn't be able to attain the same goals as larger fleets, but should be able to damage enough resources to make their presence felt. my idea is that by forcing material storage outside of stations and pos towers smaller groups can degrade resource collection even though the miners have docked up.essentially, a small fleet attacks the silos storing the resources and take them to structure. then each successful hit on that structure destroys a certain percentage of material in the structure thereafter in a decreasing amount the longer the attack.a small fleet shouldn't be able to destroy all stored resources in a silo. they destroy a decreasing amount the longer they attack in a logarithmic scale to a asymptote of 66%-75%, as a initial suggestion. this amount should be calculated based upon by how much has been in the structure within the last 24hrs of the attack, not the full capacity.for example; a fleet destroys 20% of the 24hr level of resources in a silo in about 20 minutes of shooting hull. then they might be able to destroy another 5% the next hour. at some point is it not worth attacking that structure anymore, but to move on the next silo at that location or another solar system.travel:in regard to travel, sub caps should be able to move in the manner as they do. capital ships should take a lot longer to move to the other side of the eve cluster. right now it might take a week of logistics and a weekend to move some of the largest fleets to the other side of the eve cluster.but it should take a lot longer. ask twenty people and you will probably get twenty different answers of what it should be.my idea is that logistics could be moved to a npc mechanic since there are few who would like to do the work in realistic logistics. we want to shoot ships.so have a npc mechanic where you enter you want enough fuel to move 100 dreads staged along their line of travel and npc transports start spawning moving that fuel for you. this should be a around the clock operation until you stop moving fuel.moving this fuel takes time and can be adjusted to how hard we want it to maintain capital ships further from home.these npc transports are immune to warp bubbles and are escorted by a npc combat force cruiser and below similar to incursion npcs. these could be the racial rats for the region of the home system for the contracting political entity.so the forces interdicting this logistic route will need to have enough pilots stationed along the route to point and destroy individual transports and defend against the defending npc warships.the political entity that the transports belong to might want to have their own defending force to protect these logistic routes and might be able to choose between small continuous npc groups leaving every ten minutes to larger groups leaving every hour.but as in the resource destruction above, even if the interdictors can destroy 100% of the transport ships, only a portion of the material to be moved is destroyed. maybe adjust this for how many ships destroyed and how many total jumps to destination base.so, it might be better to destroy 20% of the ships across 5 jumps instead of 100% of ships on first jump. this will be a soft pressure to have many more smaller pvp groups interdicting along the total route than blobbing at one spot.moving logistics to a npc mechanic could allow us to put more emphasis on logistic and strategic mobility while allowing the game to be more fun.shooting someone's npc transports can be just as much pvp as any other pvp activity in the game, just more fun for everyone."
5/17/2014,"this is a very logical and solid image, i like it. but there is an inherent problem in all this black ops stuff targeting the infrastructure, which stems from differencies in timezones. this is why the mechanics of pos/station timers were added to the game. we need some kind of a timer here too, or it will be too easy to disrupt any infrastracture just by attacking your enemies while most of them are having dreams.how about that: every silo can be switched off and retracted back under the pos shield after miners have finished their job? in this fully retracted and deactivated state it stops processing its content right away, until it's activated again. but you can't deactivate it right away as local starts rising, it has a dealy of 30 to 120 minutes. in this ""offlining"" state it still protrudes from uder the pos's shield and fully active, and can be attacked with results you are describing.so now it requires a little bit more of a planning from ""mining overseers"" (like, ""we mine today until 9 p.m. so we should initiate deactivation process at 8 p.m."" or ""today we can't ensure enough military presence after 6 p.m. so lets finish early than usual today, we don't need unnecessary risk"")moreover, some tools for ceos or directors to switch a huge ammount of such intallations to ""offlining"" state at once are needed that it wouldn't become too much of a hassle."
5/17/2014,"now it starts to bother me. you are crossing dangerous line here. if we start think like this, than next can be ""lets dump mining, it's boring to death, and shoot some ships instead"", or ""screw this nerdish stuff with making and researching things, lets blow some hangars"". i don't think that substituting all logistics needed for supplying your military campaigns with npc driven supply chains is acceptable. can you explain in more detail which resources these npc transports should be delivering, from where and to what destination?"
5/17/2014,"i'm sorry for making you waiting for answer so long.not exactly. the in-game voting system itself is mostly a convinient tool, not an incentive to become involved. but you should agree, than if every time you log on to the game you see a very noticeable, flashy panel spewing popups about how important is your opinion is and how all the future of the project rests on your decisions, that at least has to ignite a little spark of curiosity, enough to click on it to findout what is going on. and here you will see a brief introduction of csm candidates appealing for your support to create a better eve for you. or hot topic survey asking for your oppinion on how this particular feature should be implemented or changed, or do you think this recent change was for bad or for good - and offer you a clickable links to forum's topics discussing corresponding questions where you could elaborate you opinion further.this is a real incentive, as i see it. thats exactly the case why we have those flashy and pompous election campaigns irl. people need to be agitated, pulled out of their beaten tracks and zones of comfort for a moment, we need to draw their attention and show them that this is for real, this is happening here and now, and their participation is important.because they have their opinions too and they are also paying customers. but they distant themselves from the active part of community for great variety of reasons.for them all those important events - fanfests, elections, public conferences - just happen in another dimension. many of them heard about csm, but that just keep sliping their minds again and again. they think like ""oh, that pretty intresting, i probably should check it.. tomorrow, i too eager to try my new ship today"", and then forget competely about it for a couple of months. and then something else distracts them. or even they think ""elections, heh, it's always just a farce, and how it's even supposed to be related to the game? screw them all, that definetly has nothing to do with mere player like me"".yes, they aren't intrested enough to track all the activities, check all the boards on regular basis to not miss the elections, or important surveys and meetings with developers, follow all those [not so noticeable] links in game's launcher. they engrossed in their real and virtual lives too deep for that. but they could convey an invalubale volumes of information no one else can. about real impact of changes that was made to the game world and mechanics, about usefulness of all those features are being added in, on how really are they feel about choosen course of the development. what one is able to see here on forums and in results of those third-party surveys is just a tip of an iceberg.i know it because i was one such player and it took me more than 3 years to find out how important all these activities are and that it really has significant impact on the game's present and future i can be involved in. it's all about evolving too. as a project that puts playerbase's feedback at the forefront we need such tools to hold a hand firmly on pulse of its moods and to draw as much of them as we can to the active side, at last. and to succeed in that we need to put it right in front their eyes, to be here every time they enter the game world. because you can play eve without visiting the official forums even once, but still to play it you must log on to it."
5/17/2014,"i'm afraid just a little icon won't do. what we need is some noticable enough, visually appealing, large panel that instantly catches an eye when someone log on to the game and which you can click and fully retract to familiarize yourself with recent important events. enhanced with different dynamic visual effects during important quizs and campaigns struggling to get player's attention. popups, blinking pictograms, changing of theme music, even voice alerts - any means feasible."
5/17/2014,"and that's exactly the reason why we must start agressively advertise it too, with new info panel i'm proposing. people at least have to be awaked to the fact that tools to change the game world is at their arm's length, just a few clicks away.major alliances are driven by their major biases while choosing decisions they advocate. the rest of the playerbase must be relieved from the burden of their ambitions."
5/17/2014,"yet, we probably will have to place some restrictions concerning who is allowed to particiapte. no trial accounts allowed, obviously. moreover, it would be a reasonable thing to require at least two to three months of active subscription to particiapte in surveys, and even elections, to protect the system from manipulations through easly createable alts."
5/17/2014,
5/18/2014,just make it like with corp history so you can see name history of each player to avoid scam > change name > scam etc.if you can see the previous names it shouldn't really cause any problems.
5/18/2014,just delete cynos. allow caps to jump themselves.
5/18/2014,please no this sounds like a terrible idea.
5/18/2014,"personally i don't care about that part of it.so the op wants to provide stations that supers can dock at?no. no npc repair facilities, none of that - forget it. go trade for what's needed and make sure you have the proper facilities/support outside of stations to deal with this.the only time they should have docked supers is when ccp has a game reason for doing so - such as the ""oops... disarmed a lot of super carriers with no support"" changes and the like. such rare ""game change"" situations i can see a temporary docking being provided but *not* some npc station that soloist super cap pilots can use anytime they feel like it."
5/18/2014,"you assume allot with your response. no where in his op is he calling for the end of 3rd party services....to use an analogy (say for instance, the up and coming industry changes regarding slots for installation of jobs). your basically saying the removal of industry slots will lead the death or lack of use of a pos by all players in eve. where once key players who could provide the ""facilities and or 3rd party researching capabilities"" to lesser mortals in eve, all would now have the option to do as they please... for a price given a specific location.by allowing supers to dock (somewhere), your not killing off the existence of a 3rd party service, your just allowing people options to do without them.and lets be clear, jita's stations are the biggest platforms for scams... the risk remains for supers to be scammed like any 400 mil standard raven contract.....allowing players to have options in a sandbox sounds very sandboxy to me..."
5/18/2014,"i can see this if other changes come along as well.1) api gives the info. this already happens and any outside sites would retain this ability.2) use of a locator agent gives these details - you're effectively hiring a detective and the details should provide standings with npc groups as well as your ""resume""/employment history.i have no problems with people having a bit of privacy about such things as long as the details are available if one pays for them in-game.also, the api and locator functions should provide a reference of some sort if a character ""switched accounts"". not any account details, just the fact ""something"" happened which indicates this fact."
5/18/2014,"the only reason you want to hide your employment history is because at some stage, you signed up with people that closed doors to you moving forward based purely on their reputation.live with the consequences of the employment options you make. player driven gameplay working as intended."
5/18/2014,"recon ships - same hull, different t2 variations. t2 transports - different hulls, same classification.1 has a covert ops cloak option, the other doesn't. both use the same t2 skill to fly but whether a covert cloak is needed or not is tied to the specific variant of the hull - not to the class of ship.if the plan is for more variants under a t2 heading then it makes sense to introduce the skill with the first ship - not add other ships in later then try and retrofit the requirement - blocking people from flying what they own.ccp's plan makes sense in this respect."
5/18/2014,"i wouldn't be for dumping activities such as any resource collection. what i'm talking about is simply adding some npc logistic traffic that can be interdicted nearly 24 hrs a day, similar to why the timer mechanic exists. but interdicting this 100% doesn't mean that 100% of what was being transferred is destroyed.adding npcs to doing some of the more boring tasks could make this game more fun for everyone. but this npc work should be limited to the transport of material and maybe defense, like pos guns do now. this could be gate guns, station guns, pos guns, transport escorts, and maybe some other things.but those npc transports and defenders do cost something, along with the loss of the material interdicted. but that could be a whole other discussion.this specific idea is that the transporting of material needed to support capital ship movements outside of your home could be transferred to a npc mechanic. this would be mainly jump fuel and maybe ammo and maybe could even include pos fueling.the idea is to make it progressively harder to support your operations the farther you are from your home systems. this could be done with fuel cost, as it is now, but doesn't seem to work very well due to cost not being an issue with the bigger organizations. this could be done with making it physically longer to travel anywhere, but many players would be against that. or this could be done by making it take longer to move fuel from one point to another along with making it interdict-able along the way, but within a npc mechanic.doing this in an npc mechanic with hundreds of transports moving from your home systems to your remote base on a daily basis, could create a true logistical infrastructure that can be more readily interdicted. this is similar to timers, where you create an ability for someone living on the other side of the planet the ability to interdict your logistics.so instead of a few 5bil ships ninja moving all your fuel like nearly invulnerable supertankers, you would have hundreds of npc fuel haulers moving your fuel 24 hrs a day, which allows interdiction from those in a different time zone. kind of like timers.but since this is a npc mechanic, destroying 100% of the ships shouldn't destroy 100% of the fuel to be moved. just a portion of it based upon some balance.the idea is to create a npc logistical chain that provides for others to interdict without the ability to shut if off 100%. this creates a lot of targets for those in different time zones to interdict someone's logistics.this could be even extended to fueling pos towers where the npcs actually fuel the towers as long as enough fuel makes it there. so instead of players fueling pos towers themselves, these npcs do, leaving the player to decide how much fuel he should ship to ensure the pos stays fueled during interdiction of these logistics.this could create some interesting gameplay where only so much fuel can be sitting at the pos and by the attacker varying his attack times, he might be able to create a temporary shortage if the defenders are trying to limit how much they send. or the defender can just max out fuel transfers limiting the affects of interdiction, losing the extra fuel transferred, and at a significant cost increase.like i said earlier, there are some really boring things that npcs could do much better in this game. the track the devs have taken so far is to make it easier for players to move the stuff via jump freighters, but that limits the interdiction of one of the most important parts of supplying forces, the logistical chain. and in doing that, the devs have made it far too easy to move vast forces all over in short periods of time with little chance to interdict.putting these things in an interdict-able npc mechanic can bring more complexity to the game regarding logistics and dramatically increase the ability for small gang warfare to have a greater commutative effect on the largest political entity's activities.note: how much fuel is moved how quickly at what cost would be a subject of balance."
5/18/2014,"you still haven't specified how exactly this system should work. i mean, like this: ""the exact route of logistic chain are set by player via star map. transports spawn at the station chosen as supply point and start alligning to the first gate on the route for 10 minutes to allow interception. then they jump to gate to 0km and move to next system. here and further they will allign and jump without delay"". or they will be using some kind of cyno fields to move along chosen route? have you come up with an exact algorithm showing how it should be implemented?this is another problem, as i see it. do you intend to unconditionally force this chain to function 24/7 untill set amounts of fuel are transfered, or there will be controls allowing to switch it off? what bothers me here is the same thing i've pointed out above, while commenting on you mining infrastracture disrupting idea. it's too easy for an attacker to choose when to strike to not meet any sunbstantional resistance in such case. wouldn't it be more reasonable to add ability to put this chain on pause when most of your alliance are login off? the same algorithm i've proposed for circumventing similar problem in case of mining disrtupting could be used here - after you initiated supply chain's pausing, it still operates for some time before going down for real.do you mean that poses outside your ""home water"" shoud be also supplied directly from your main base at home, or in that case supply chain will originate from a nearest station in the remote region?like i said, you have logical and intresting ideas here, but they lack some specifics."
5/18/2014,"i guess what i'm talking about is more high level ideas and would leave the details to those who would implement these mechanics, but for some ideas i would suggest the below as possibilities.although other people might have better ideas how to implement the higher level ideas.my idea on these npc transports are: the route can be set like any autopilot route with waypoints and system avoidance. transports spawn at distribution points of fuel depots in your home system or advance bases, which could be new structures placed near poses or similar structures. advance bases could be new structures that cost somewhere between a pos and outpost. these transports are immune to warp bubbles and could warp to zero or 15km depending on balance considerations. they align like any ship of their class on other side of gate and can be pointed. they travel to destination via the waypoints. these are just some ideas of how to implement this high level idea. there could be better ones out there. transports can be set to travel in small groups or massive groups less frequently. you should have the ability to schedule the most busy times for your convoys, but there should be some ships moving 24 hrs a day. it shouldn't completely shut down. i like the idea of a distribution network that the player can customize. there could be refineries and depots in your home system that you concentrate the fuels your harvest. then you could have remote bases as describe above with additional fuel depots and distribution points. so you can link your home depot with mid path depots then have a destination depot. you can set how much fuel you want moved to a depot and these npc ships will move it to that point which could be several depots down line. capital ships can fuel at any depot that has a distribution point.heavy interdiction can significantly impact how long it takes to get fuel to the very end of the line.the main point i'm trying to make is that there should be a npc run logistical mechanic that can be interdicted by hostile forces.of course this mechanic can be adjusted to better meet the needs of the owning organizations, but they shouldn't be able to insure all their logistics run during friendly high time.a significant amount should run nearly 24 hours.another consideration is how far capital ships can jump. maybe limit that to adjacent constellations instead of light years. or use both. so you max skills you can jump to any system that is in an adjacent constellation as long as it is less than you max jump range. you can not jump further than an adjacent constellation.maybe balance jump fuel usage to where you need to fuel at least every other constellation. or maybe allow a capital ship to use the destination distribution point fuel supply to jump to a depot so you don't strand capital ships without fuel.so you can't jump if there isn't enough fuel at your destination and will have to wait until the npcs deliver more fuel.(you don't want to strand capital ships out of jump fuel)so therefore you would need a fuel depot and distribution point in each constellation on the route to where you are going.that might not be the best way of doing it, but is just an idea based upon needing a significant npc logistics mechanic to support force projection via capital ships."
5/18/2014,"after coming back to eve after a long pause i had to learn that a lot of things changed, including exploration. i left right after the first exploration change (which wasn't really satisfying, and the stupid drone changes then booted me from the game), but i missed all the ship changes, so bear with me if i am not 100% correct on these atm.i am a great exploration fan and was basically waiting since i first found the core scanner for an update on this, and here it is now. i think many things have been done right, especially those new exploring focused ships (which are built surprisingly close to the suggestions i made when i left), but there is still a good amount of room for improvement.scanningwith the new scanning changes this is... let's say idiot-proof. when before i spent most of my time adjusting probes for the perfect result, i can now probe down even the most difficult sites in less than 30 seconds, which is mostly time waiting on probes to get done scanning. one can say this is dumbing down, or one can say this is taking out the annoyance, i think it is somewhere in between. it would be good if there was some player skill involved in this as currently it is 99% char-skill based.the effects on economy are clearly visible: scan loot isn't worth much and high-sec scanning nets about as much isk as high-sec mining (as far as i can tell from my low samples), which is probably a good thing, considering that in both no risk is involved. low-sec exploration however needs a fix, as currently all low-sec sites are heavily over-farmed. so low-sec exploration has higher risk but no higher income. null-sec exploration seems fine, as this is the usual logistic/surveillance issue as everything null-sec, but offers a high income. wh exploration seems pointless at the moment, as you have a very high risk vs a low income, or - if you own the wh - close to no risk vs medium income.i strongly suggest to build in some mechanics that allow spawning of sites when you enter a system. i would implement a system that uses a system id (name) as seed for a random number generator, so sites spawn in specific systems for players (= no total random, sites spawn for you in specific systems that you need to find = exploring), with a chance modifier based on sec status and how over-farmed the area is. a player then could fly around and know that eventually he/she will find something, the question is just where. there still would be an incentive to fly to less crowded systems as it increases your chance for sites, but you no longer have the issue that players fly around through low-sec for hours without a single site to loot.sitesthe new sites offer no variety, it is basically cans with some decoration around. the new hacking system is fun the first time you do it, but gets boring as well very soon. many things could be done here, but either there is a strong lack of creativity at the team that develops this, or exploration is supposed to be a very boring activity. i'd really love to see some change here.the new ghost sites are close to pointless. you can circumvent the entire system by just opening the first can and ignore the rest, while a look at your watch tells you exactly whether this is still safe or not. if you could write addons for eve, someone would come up with a stop-watch addon and disable the entire danger from these sites. this follows the same pattern as seemingly all exploration: fun the first few times, then boring as hell once you understand it. i would love to see some sites here that includes forms of puzzles that challenge the mind/player and not the left mouse button. a memory game style hacking site, or one where you need to maneuver your ship through moving obstacles are simple ideas that would still be a lot more fun than smashing mr left mouse button till hacking either succeeds or you need to try again.[...]"
5/18/2014,"exploration shipsi totally love that those have been added, although they are not yet perfect and imo need some tweaks, the general direction is very good. the problem that needs to be solved is to have a ship that is good at scanning, can reach difficult to reach areas, can fight/tank npcs well, but is not the prime choice for pvp. you currently try to solve this dilemma by making the ships very expensive, but i am not sure if this is the right way to go, considering the insane amounts of money you can make in null-sec.all exploration ships however suffer greatly from the drone changes made a long time ago. npcs targeting and destroying your main weaponry is neither fun, nor controllable and violates the concept of not having to reload. it forces exploration ships to equip a target painter, just to grab ""aggro"", a concept with makes no sense in the eve universe and is neither intuitive nor fun. i can just hope that one day you admit that this drone change was a mistake and revert it, until that day all drone boats are limited in use. and especially with the planned summer changes, where you can no longer rely on sentries with all ships, this will get even worse.while the ability of exploration ships (nestor excluded) to get into dangerous systems is supported well through the use of a cloaking device, they really lack a concept of exploring the unknown. i would really love to see a mechanic added that allows your ship to enter unkown/random systems. my last suggestion on exploration featured a worm-hole style jump drive, and i still think that would greatly enhance the exploration experience.concept: wormhole jump drivein order to allow exploration players to enjoy the feeling of discovering the unknown, all soe exploration ships should be equipped with a jump system that i (in lack of a better name) call the ""wormhole jump drive"". it allows those ships to jump into other systems in the same way as other jump drives, except that you do not need a cyno as target. instead you can select any wormhole as target that is sufficiently large enough to (theoretically) support the size of your ship and it will sap mass from the wh on jump, eventually destroying it and throwing you at a random location (as with all collapsing whs). in addition this does not require fuel (to follow the explorer concept), but to balance this (mostly in terms of pvp) this device should have a ""reload"" time of 10 minutes, and cannot be used to warp into cyno-jammed systems. so once you jump you better fly safe for a while as you cannot escape again for some time.this could be implemented either as a standard feature of all soe exploration ships (which i would prefer) or as a module that can be equipped (but that would currently conflict with the slot layout). a use-case example:1) player right-clicks on his ship and selects 'jump to'.2) this menu lists all systems with appropriate wormholes in range, with ""local system"" on top (if it is a valid target) as a fast bail-out system and to make it usable in wh space.3) if the player selects a system, the cap is drained (as with standard jumping) and - given enough cap - a wormhole animation appears and the player is transported to the target system a few seconds later. he/she will reappear at any random wormhole in that system that satisfies the ship's size requirement.4) the wormhole jump drive then begins to reload and will be unavailable for 10 minutes.using a list of systems instead of using the star map is for once easier to implement, and then it is supposed to enhance the exploration feeling. a real explorer knows the map and has a much easier time to use this than someone who doesn't. and if in danger you maybe have to make a 'blind' jump if you do not know the area well.asterothe astero is an excellent exploration ship for all security spaces, but lacks the fire-power to do combat sites of difficulty ded 3+. it suits well for all high-sec exploration and low/null/wh sec data/relic sites.while there is probably no complaint from any explorer, this ship doesn't feel balanced well to me. it is out-performing all t1 frigates and many t2 frigates as well. a good fitting features close to 150 dps with a solid tank, good mobility, high cargo, cloaking and no drawbacks beside being a frigate. if this ship would be cheaper to buy, everyone and their minmatar would use this for pvp. as i assume that the price will drop eventually vs the high income of null-sec, i am sure this will be used in pvp a lot in the future, forcing you to come up with a balance change eventually.as tank and fire-power is required for proper exploration, i previously suggested to limit mobility to limit the use for pvp. instead the astero (and the others) has a very high mobility for fast retreat, and all i ask myself is: how does it even manage that given the huge cargo? should you decide for a pvp balance change, i would suggest to make explorer ships too slow/inert for pvp and maybe add a +1 warp strength for escape, but leave the rest as it is.stratiosas the astero this ship is an excellent exploration ship for high, low and easy wh space. it's fire-power, tank and speed allow to clear up to ded 5 difficulties and thanks to the high drone bay/bandwidth a pilot has many options to deal with incoming threats. i don't really see the purpose of the additional high-slots as the damage is extremely low, but then they do no harm either.as the astero, this ship is probably too strong in pvp, but not as excessively as the astero. mostly because t2 cruisers are much more specialized than t2 frigates and can out-perform the stratios with their special abilities well. however if you are in a t1 cruiser fighting a stratios, you will have a very bad time. to adjust this balance even more, i would take away a high slot and add a +1 warp strength, to focus more on getting out than to actually kill stuff in pvp."
5/18/2014,"nestorwhile the other explorer ships are performing well in their role, i consider the nestor a complete failure as an explorer. it is an interesting ship, but it is useless for exploration in its current form. with the lack of a covert cloaking device (which is an understandable balance decision) it cannot reach dangerous areas, nor can it avoid enemy fleets. it cannot fight well and lacks a proper tank for harder ded difficulties. it lacks the cap to sustain the remote repair, so flying in groups with this ship is not a valid option either. most other battleships with a core probe launcher will out-perform this ship.i would re-design the ship with the following changes to make it a good solo/fleet exploration ship:- 15% reduction in cap usage for remote repair per level of logistics.- 3000 m<U+FFFD> fleet hangar, -250 m<U+FFFD> cargo capacity.- 100% reduction of cloaking device scan resolution reduction (as both a hint to the player on how to equip this and a survivability change).- 10% increase in cap recharge (which should be a good value in combination with the rr cost reduction above).- able to use covert jump portals (so you can actually warp with your friends through a blackops jump bridge).- +1 warp strength.- able to equip wormhole jump portal generator (see below).this change should bring it in line with the other explorer ships and make it a good ship for solo or small group exploration. the fleet hangar and the wh jump portal generator makes this the black-ops for exploration. the removal of scan resolution reduction should be a good compromise between not being able to warp cloaked, but at least being able to hide. as the speed will still be reduced, you are basically stationary (~30 m/s), so you cannot use it for surprise attacks and if spotted you first need to flee to a safe spot. with the reduction of rr cost and the slight cap increase this ship should be able to sustain self repair and run a medium rr at the same time (almost) cap stable (depending on the fitting focus).concept: wormhole jump portal generatorthis module (only fitable on the nestor) is basically a mix of the covert jump portal generator and the wormhole jump drive as above: no fuel, 10 minute recharge delay, targets semi-random wh instead of cynos (cl3+ as this is a bs). as reaching new, unexplored space is a requirement for exploration, this module should fit well for small-gang exploration. while the other exploration ships can use this internally as well (as suggested), there is still a need to get the other ships 'down there', namely covert transporters, covert defense ships and probably the (soon to be implemented) covert miner. in terms of pvp surprise attacks i consider this well balanced, as for once you cannot enter cyno jammed systems, you can only send in covert ships, and you appear at a very predictable location. whoever lives in the target system can scan down the currently existing wormholes, bubble them and if the nestor appears on the directional scanner immediately launch an attack on them. alternatively wormholes can simply be destroyed to prevent any jump into the system if a cyno-jammer is not available."

5/20/2014,"basically, make it so that you could get 20 to 50% more income from trivia mission running than before (in a new version of this piece new corp fleet missions are proposed, with income scaling with the number of participants; i'm currently translating it to english), if you are in a player owned corporation of at least 5-10+ active members and running missions in fleet with corpmates. and have the same income if you are just in such corp, but playing solo (with inherent risks of awoxing and getting wardecced). and new players get meaningfull grace period (up to 3 months of active sub) as proposed.so it's more like shift the highsecs a little closer to ""risk/reward"" paradigm and reward collective gameplay more than soloing. and make corporation mean something aside from just a tool to rid of npc corp's tax, make it more valuable as it now requires substantional fees to maintain. it's perfectly in tune with latest nullsec changes which tryies to make you treasure you assets here and protect it more. current corp mechanics doesn't offer enough reward for collective gameplay to those living in highs, but places substantional risks on corp member, this why it should be changed."

5/21/2014,"people keep asking if someone is afk then why are they a threat. simply put is because you don't know. an afk player should not present the same threat as an active player. people are saying things are balanced but if i can present the same threat whilst i'm out at the pub as i can whilst at my computer, that's not balanced. to understand this, you need to understand why cloaky campers are a threat just being there. if you belong to a small corp or alliance you might not have anywhere to move to, you might not have people to support you in your tz. not cloaky campers are a threat, as they should be but i should know if he is a threat or not and be able to take the risk with that information to go out ratting or mining. i shouldn't have to take that risk only for him to be out at mcdoi have no issue with cloaky camping, i'm primarily a miner purely because that's what i have the time to do and yet i don't mind cloaky campers. cloaky camping itself is a viable mechanic and a valid tactic but being afk isn't playing the game. i go out mining, if i use a can i have to be at my client every 1.5 - 3 minutes to move ore from hulk to can. i can't just set the lasers going and go afk all day so why can cloaks? my suggestion to fix cloaks would be to simply be you have to reactive them. rather than turning it on and that being that, you activate it and it creates a cloak field that last x amount of time. after x amount of time that field becomes unstable and you have a set amount of time to reactivate the cloak before you become visible. this option in no way breaks or nerfs cloaks. it won't stop camping or recon or hot dropping, it simply requires some player interaction to use. frankly if you say no to having to reactivate a module, you are only arguing because you want to be lazy and have things made easy for you. which ironically is the arguement people use against people wanting a change to cloaks. yes it works both ways."
5/21/2014,"this is no idea for scanning down a cloaked ship but once you can be fairly sure there is one close by ... how about a mobile structure that you can deploy and assume control of. then, like the directional scanner, you would select a (limited) angle of aperture, point in one direction and activate the module which sprays a cloud of highly accelerated particles in that direction and depending on the density of the particle stream (which depends on angle and distance), a ship get's uncloaked."

5/22/2014,i just wanted to throw this out there but an advanced contracting skill would be nice for those of us doing marketing stuff in the game. with the trade skills you have:trade---+4 orders per levelretail--+8 orders per levelwholesale--+16 orders per leveltycoon--+32 orders per levelwith contracting operations you can only have a max of 21 personal contracts per toon. sure you can do corporation contracting and do contracts for your corporation but that requires rolls in you corp and trust of the individual doing the contracts. but for doing personal contracts if you are running large operations you need to have multiple toons running contracts to keep up with demand. i think if we had even 1 advanced skill for personal contracts it would help even this out with the trade skills. i would propose keeping it in line with the retail skills where the advanced contracting skill would be either2x or a 3x skill with 8-10 more contracts per level.we can see where this takes us and then maybe in the future think about adding another such skill.

5/24/2014,"firstly - i'm hoping this is in the right section, if not i suppose f&i would be the next best place.secondly, i truly do appreciate any feedback, but please read the whole of the first 4 posts. this is from a brainstorm about 2 weeks ago that has grown since then, and i have edited it a few times based on input from the post linked just below. thanks for your time!thirdly, for a similar idea, please read this post and give your feedbackproposal: sovereignty re-workissue: current sov mechanics are based on arbitrary structures (tcu, sbu, outpost and ihub) as well as timer-based pvp. a good description of the current state of gaining and losing sovereignty can be found here"
5/24/2014,"the tug-of-war:the new system of ownership would be that each activity that a character/corp/alliance does in a certain solar system adds to a pool of sovereignty points for the system. the more, and more diverse activities that happen in a system, the more points a group in the system can accumulate. each activity has a point amount for a given unit or type of that activity. each activity has a cap on the total points that can be had in a day, and this cap is based on the class of that activity. the class of the activity is modified by certain structures (see below) online in the system. this is how better pve, industrial and pi related activities are leveled up (similar to current sov level mechanics). this is also where determining how many people you want in your system, how much investment in each class improving structure the group can afford, and how much manpower you want to dedicate to defending this activity can play a role. based on a running 5-day average of points earned vs. the possible points based on system structures determines whether a group can upgrade their system. higher system upgrades would allow better structure and outpost upgrades, which then allows for more points and further system upgrades. the point to note here is that not every activity available in eve would need to be performed to upgrade the system; however, it would become increasingly difficulty to upgrade the system with only a few point earning activities happening in the system. therefore the group that wants sovereignty of the system needs to have players doing things in that system. activities in other systems would not add to the point pool for the first system.the attacker, in this case, is trying to decrease the point pool of the sovereignty holders of the system. this is accomplished in any number of ways. certainly, blowing up the dominant entity's structures could play a part in this. so also should pvp activities play into this. attackers would either negate sovereignty points by performing their own activities, or they would reduce the accumulation of points by the sovereignty holders. the attackers also have a point cap for a day, and their points can be modified in <U+FFFD>class<U+FFFD> similarly to the dominant force. more below. in this way, the initial ownership of a system is decided by who is accumulating the most sov. points over a 5-day period. once a minimum amount of activity has been performed and the necessary points earned, a group can claim sovereignty and can then reap the benefits of certain structures. structures increase the available daily points, which could further solidify the dominance of the system. the attacker can only steal points from the sovereign force, and when the system is neutral (zero or negative points on average for the sovereign force) again, the attacker then must become the new dominant force, and therefore needs to accomplish the same tasks the original group had to accomplish in order to earn points and take system sovereignty. and here is the key: full points will only be awarded for the specific class of activity. as an example, if i take a neutral system and earn enough points over the running 5 day average to upgrade the system to level two, then only class two activities will earn full points (for both the dominant force and the attacking force). lower class activities will net an exponentially decreased number of points toward the point pool. aggression by a more powerful attacking entity bringing in a significantly overbearing attacking fleet that is ""out-classing"" the sovereign group would be wasteful. in this situation, their aggression would not effectively negate points from the sov. holders. see more below on potential types of pvp point accumulation.as well, the sovereign force cannot up their point total without also spending the time, resources and man-power to increase the various structure/system classes. upgrading to higher classes of structures, but not taking (or not being able to take) full advantage of that upgrade will not effectively gain points. in this way, smaller corps/alliances can hold a system, and have a modicum of insulation against a powerhouse blapping them out of the universe. now they can net the benefits that a low class system can give to them, while larger entities can upgrade to higher classes for their benefits.as for having dominance over entire regions of space, the necessary man-power and resources should be the ultimate example of diminishing returns and risk vs. reward. system/structure class will also play into this situation. for example, if a player group wishes to raise their system x to class 6, then every system that there is a gate to from system x must be upgraded to a specific class to allow this. the idea here would be certain high density systems or small clusters that have been upgraded with small to medium buffer zones of less upgraded space. think of a castle/town center surrounded by farms and small cities.next up: structures"
5/24/2014,"structures for dominance:the structures for dominance need to be more numerous, and more diverse. they also should only be one of the indices that determine system ownership. they should also not require dreadnaughts to destroy (in some cases). these structures should encourage small to medium scale assaults in lower class systems, and encourage larger fleets in higher class systems. these structures are not absolutely necessary to complete most types of activities for the sov. group, however they serve to multiply points earned and can add to the available daily point pool of a system.each structure is suited for the different activities a group wants to partake of. a group can upgrade structure for higher quality opportunities, or place more of the structures to increase volume, or both as system class allows. for example, several <U+FFFD>scanning structures"" placed throughout the system should reveal the location of anomalies, asteroid clusters and the like. these structures, once anchored would need some type of fuel to maintain their ability to relay information to those in the alliance/corporation. as well, these structures should be only moderately well defended. this increases the total available daily points, and discrete number/types of opportunities players have to engage in. to earn these points, players/groups would need to accomplish the specific task (kill this rat, do this much research, gather this much material) or accomplish generic tasks with specific ship/fleet/fitting or under specific circumstances. to reiterate, task that require specific circumstances to gain points would only reward those points when completed correctly. the task could have alternate means to be completed, but would then not give full credit, or possibly no credit at all.the structures then create targets of opportunity that have a real meaning for the system owners to defend. they should be only moderately difficult to replace, but then also only moderately difficult for the appropriate sized attacking force to overwhelm if undefended. again, this means that a system owner needs participation from corps/allies in the system to defend the structure in order to maintain the point multiplier and opportunity generator. as structure number and class improve, so too does the total available daily points for that activity improve. as well, this gives attackers more points to steal. for a quick example, lets say a class four structure generates 100 sites, each worth 10 sov. points once completed (1000 points total if fully used). for the attacker, this target structure would net, say, 800 negative points. so then, if the system owners fully utilize that array, they will offset the potential loss of points if it is destroyed. on the other hand, if the system cannot/does not support the full utilization of that array, then the attacking force could possibly net enough points to reduce the point pool. depending on the total number of points available over a day, the activity of both the sovereign and attacking entities, and the length of the attack, dominance could shift rather quickly. structures should be not necessary for every activity, but should benefit all of them and be a requirement for a few. the list of discrete activities is exhaustive and i can't list it here. suffice to says that system class should allow each of those activities to improve, but the placement of the appropriate structure should make that activity much more rewarding and facilitate more of that activity. the more diverse the structure base, the more diverse the activity base and the more individuals a single system can theoretically support, given that all of those individuals are active enough to maintain the necessary point total for a given sov level.for the attacker:for the attacking party, sovereignty is trying to be taken from the system owner. points earned by the attacking party work toward reducing or negating the dominance points earned by the system owners. pvp activities would be the primary means of the attacker earning points. however, as described earlier, the system level would dictate what types of engagements would net the most points. structures for the attacker would expand these ""rules of engagement"" to a certain degree.in other words, only specific targets/tactics would net points for the attacker, again based on system class and the structures the attackers have placed. in this case, if an attacking force truly is trying to take over a system of a specific class, the system owner (rightly so) would have a small say in dictating engagements. again, this drives different scales of conflict. if the attacker is truly making a push for system sovereignty, the system owner must respond and maintain activity, otherwise they would face losing system class and dominance by lack of activity. if the attacking force, on the other hand, was simply roaming for kills, then their engagements might not have any significant influence on the system point pool at all, especially if the fleet composition is not aligned with the system class, or if their attack is transient and point total averages toward nothing. next post - losing sovereignty and a quick example, to hopefully help this make sense:"
5/24/2014,"losing sovereignty in this scheme happens in a few ways:attrition - an attacking force minimizes the points earned by the sovereign force in a siege fashion. the owners are unable in this case to earn enough points over the 5 day running average to maintain a system's sov. level. as the sov level decreases, structures that are based on that level will be forced offline/inactive/incapacitated, however they need not be destroyed. once the point pool reaches the minimum required to claim the system (which could take as few as 4-5 days, or much more, depending on tactics) the system is now unclaimed and the process for taking sovereignty begins anew. demolition - an attacking force destroys all/some of the sov. level dependent structures in a system. this decreases the sovereign's available daily point pool, and even if they do maintain activity, they cannot earn enough points over the 5-day running average to maintain sovereignty at a given level unless they can muster enough resources to re-launch the structure(s). depending on how many/which structures are destroyed, activity level by both, and points earned by either side, sovereignty could be reduced or eliminated. once the sovereign daily point total reduces to less than the minimum required to claim sovereignty, the system is now unclaimed and the process starts again.transfer - an attacking force (for lack of a better term) purchases a system for a certain amount. corp/allied structure ownership is transferred to the attacking force, who is now able to accumulate sovereignty points.as far as accumulating points is concerned, the various pve activities available in eve can be put to metric and would be easy to derive appropriate point gains for each activity. i'll list a few examples for illustration:research a bpo 1 level (me/pe or whatever the new scheme will be named) = gain pointsrefine a certain volume of ore in a station = pointsproduce a certain type/number of module/ship = pointsdestroy a certain isk value of rats in an anomaly = pointsmine a certain volume of ore = pointsperform certain reactions or activities that are pos based = pointssuccessfully scan/locate a specific anomaly = pointsnot only that, but pvp activities could also be classifiedkill any ship class solo = pointskill any ship class w/ a smaller ship class solo = more pointskill a certain isk value of ships (based on killmail) = pointsrepair a certain # of shield/armor/structure hp on any ship while pvp timer is on = pointspos online for a certain number of hours = pointsdestroy any non-allied, non-corporate structure in system = pointsthe list can go on. the benefit of having sovereignty is that you can anchor a structure which will increase the value of the activity (as far as earning sov. points is concerned), and increase the amount of available points, to allow you to earn enough points to get to the next sov. level. sov. level multipliers would be ((sov. level x 0.5) + 1), structure multipliers would be ((struct. level x 0.25) + 1)and points would be determined by sov. multiplier x struct. multiplierthe example of increasing the value of these activities with structures and sov. level would look like this. point accumulation would then be determined by how much activity is being done, its native point value, and the multipliers applied to it.up next: calculations!?"
5/24/2014,"i have not read the entire thread, so please bear with me if this is a duplicate (its 20 pages, seriously!). this is basically a repost from a suggestion i made about 3 years ago.i in general like how cloaking works and wouldn't want it to be removed or reduced to a pointless module, but then having an afk cloaker 24/7 in your system, silently waiting for the one moment to launch his cyno with zero methods to deal with it, is not only annoying but imo an abuse of game mechanics.my suggestion was (and still is) to add a module that can be deployed in sov space that will charge over a period of 8-12 hours and then allows to launch a system-wide emp that will disable all cloaking devices and prevents reactivation of such modules (if they were active during the initial blast) for 5-10 minutes (exact numbers to be determined).this would: not disable fly-by cloaking as using a module on a 8-12h timer for some random cloaker passing through the system is highly unlikely. not disable the usefulness of cloaking, as there is no change to the current mechanic in general. allow sov owners to have a chance to hunt down (interact as the op said) for a limited time, which will be a fight between scanning skills and the cloakers ability to evade those. a good cloaker will be able to evade during the downtime of his device, jumping from save-spot to save-spot then he can re-cloak and is safe for another 8 hours minimum. however he might loose some safe-spots during that time and needs to make new ones or will eventually face an enemy fleet the next time he uses the now scanned safe-spots again. disallow to stay cloaked afk, as you never know when the next emp blast will hit you. if one is afk during that time, the ship will be located and destroyed easily by the sov holder.such an emp blast will be a very low threat for the average cloaker, but deadly for anyone who is afk most of the time. this would reduce the usage of spys to at least semi-active chars, and help against those who are botting. because realistically no one is sitting in a system 24h a day and watches the local/scanner, people are using illegal scripts/bots for that."

5/24/2014,"that is true, but only once you activated the module. as long as it is not activated, but charged and ready to launch the blast, the cloaker must stay alert and at his pc because you could activate it any moment.in addition - as i wrote - numbers are to be determined. maybe a 2h timer is better?"

5/25/2014,"exposing one side of the equation to risk, by means of a blast or what have you, requires a balance.do not assume balance is lacking, simply because it is not convenient. balance means fair.balance does not mean fun.balance does not mean interesting.balance simply means the chances of one event is directly comparable to it's considered opposite potential.if we suggest that a perpetual unknown risk is more than can be desired for good play, then we must also push the other direction, so it's balanced potential is made real.this means, if we make pve play safer by allowing the resolution of the unknown threats, then the unknown threats must gain equal opportunity to resolve their target's fate.life always seems to favor your opponent, until you consider how their task seems equally set against them.the grass is not greener on the other side of the fence.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
5/25/2014,"please read before posting~intro~over my various bids for the csm i have advocated and pushed for various issue i felt were important to the player base. i have come to a not uncommon conclusion regarding the way in which the csm functions. without term limits and a less exploitable voting system there is simply no point in voting. for the past 3 csms null sec power blocs (most of which are cfc affiliated) have held the majority without variation. if elected the single most important thing on my agenda is csm reform. not everybody can agree on my knowledge of eve but few people would disagree with my goal to reform the way in which the csm functions. i am officially announcing my campaign for csm 10. the core goal of my entire csm campaign is to restore faith in both the csm and it's process. the entire process has been hijacked by cronyism where only the social elite and their allies may hold any sway. i am not a popular person and i am not well liked, however it cannot be ignored that the problem i describe is real. if you despise me or find me distasteful. better the devil you know.if you are one of my supporters than this is an announcement you have been waiting for.if you are undecided or feel apathetic about this process than i would remind you that i am not the reason why you feel this way, but i just might be the solution.~sources~since there appears to be so much confusion as to what the csm whitepaper says (or does not say), i will include a link below."

5/26/2014,"their best idea for that would make them unable to enter the highsec side of a wormhole.which is flatly unacceptable.but it does show that they are aware of the issue, at least. just not that they really know how they are going to fix it."

5/27/2014,"please bump this.i just copy pasted this from the wiki on name changes. wouldn't be tough to mimic real world policy, would it?""it is necessary to plead that the name change is not for a fraudulent or other illegal purpose, such as evading a lien or debt or for defaming someone else. the applicant may be required to give a reasonable explanation for wanting to change her or his name. a fee is generally payable, and the applicant may be required to post legal notices in newspapers to announce the name change. generally the judge has limited judicial discretion to grant or deny a change of name, usually only if the name change is for fraudulent, frivolous or immoral purposes.""essentially, a name change in eve would involve a simple background check including past corporations or petitions placed against you, as well as sec status at time of request. a decent explanation as to why a person would like to change their name seems logical, as well. once the name is officially changed, definitely have a name history attached to the char, with a marker for anyone who's changed their name recently, as well as alerts for friends / corps of people who have. from a dev standpoint, this is less than a headache. i hope to see this implemented. edit: definitely have only allow only one name change per char, including the request process listed above, so that this couldn't be abused over a longer eve career."
5/27/2014,"give it these limitations and i'll support:1.) character has never destroyed a player ship owned by someone else, piloted or not, while in empire space2.) character has not stolen goods within the last year3.) character has stolen a total value under the current price of a plex throughout the entire character's lifespan4.) character has never had a sec status below -0.5 at any point in time5.) character has never been kicked from a corp6.) character has never been given a personal standings below neutral by anyoneor alternatively, this limitation only:1.) a search for the character's old name turns up the character in the search along with anyone else who actually has that as a current name, and the name history can be looked up on the character's info page.tl;dr the most important bit is that it needs to not be usable as a way of hiding from a reputation. it should be obvious to all your friends and enemies who you are."
5/27/2014,"building the ihubs yourself is already quite common, since by doing so a jump freighter can deliver the hub (in component form) to the location, rather than requiring a titan bridge or wormhole.lobby ccp to let players build the ihub upgrades and you might have a point."
5/27/2014,with the jump freighter nerf coming + jump fuel usage going up would it be cost effective to continue in that way. there are jump fuel conservation low slot modes incoming but i can't see them helping much .
5/27/2014,"people are seriously overestimating the impact of the fuel thing - yes, i'm perfectly fine with paying 22.5m isk to jump a hub in like i described instead of 15m isk, if it means i can do it on my own and not have to get a titan bridge or a freighter escort op. and yes, i will continue to do so despite the so-called ""nerf"" because i can just fit cargo expanders."

5/29/2014,"i feel it is worth mentioning, to point out that i often refer to mining and cloaking as the two sides involved in this aspect of the game.regular, or front line, pvp ships are not involved, for two reasons.1. gate camps. short of an overwhelming force, gate camps are usually able to block regular pvp ships. this is what they exist to do, really, so it is not surprising that it does the job as intended. this blocks the hostile pvp ships.2. lack of interest. mining protection, and guarding pve in general, is mind numbing.if you are successful as a deterrent, you see no action beyond possibly a few npc ships, which are not worth the time lost playing in other areas often. being at the gate camp frequently achieves equally effective results, while providing for more interesting play.this blocks the friendly pvp ships.we therefore have pve ships, present for the reason of earning isk usually, and the cloaked ships specifically wanting to hunt these.i would like to see more interaction between them, rather than perpetual avoidance followed by stalemates where everyone stares at either blank screens or ship spinning.stalemate is not satisfying in a game. resolving the issue competitively is.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
5/29/2014,"i have to say that this thread is representative of why the cms is in danger of becoming pointless, i accept that the op has taken personal issue with the fact that the first person to contest the suggestion was a goon...seriously op, if you want to make a legitimate suggestion and hope that it obtains credibility and support from other members of the community in an endeavor to improve the game, don't act like a child just because you are not allied with the detractors on the subject.this thread lacks constructive discussion, i believe that the op has a point, they are asking for a security measure to be implemented to protect all parties in the sale of a commodity that is intrinsically risky to sell. do i believe that the suggestion is ideal, no...but is it at least a suggestion. does it run the risk of having a negative impact on the activities of some third parties? yes, of course it does, will it eliminate their revenue stream no, because if there were singular locations in each region where supers could dock you can bet your bottom dollar they will be watched permanently if not camped as such, and therfore taking your multi billion ship to such a location will carry with it risks, as such it will not replace the existing meta game, but in fact alter it, and it is for this reason i would say that i would not personally support it, modifying the game and eliminating meta gaming elements is not the way of eve imho.i would add, most of the replies are not constructive in picking both the merits and failures of this suggestion they are in the main, childish, i have to say malcanis, i voted for you and i have to say that your conduct here is not in keeping with what i would hope for an elected individual whom i voted for, tbh, it's disappointing and i am embarrassed that i contributed to you getting the credibility to have a csm tab against your name and afforded the opportunity to respond with such a pointless reply as tl:dr...really?!the csm need to remember; when you reply in here, you reply with the player base voice, not your own, it's a privelidge and a responsibility which has been obtained through the support of your peers...this thread does not do that justice...you can all do so much better, please work on it peeps"

5/30/2014,"i'd love this to be an option. keep cynos, but have caps able to jump themselves as well.no cyno: each capital ends up at a random location in the system (alternatively, they end up within a fixed radius of the star, since that's what the lore would say they're locked on to).with cyno: same as today.all of that said, mallak's point is valid. recons already have a 50% reduction to cycle time on cynos."
5/30/2014,to hell module !give us a mobile structure.dropped from cargo. 1 charge deployment 30 sec or lesser.cyno should have 1/2 of activation time of this thing.or better to delete this beacon from game and make itstructure only. more time to kill cyno. more surviviability of cyno deployer. cyno deployer is no longer a sitting duck. no more ibis and 10 minutes waiting. more dynamic pvp.
5/30/2014,i'm also going with a lot of players simply don;t care about the csm. just like a lot of citizens in my home country (us) could care less about congress. hence they don;t vote.

5/30/2014,what are your policies when in power?
5/30/2014,"the main focus of this csm bid for me is about restoring faith to the entire process.i am not saying i have knowledge of a superior voting method, i am saying that with certain policies in place the membership will be more diverse than just flavors of the same bloc.one such policy would be to prohibit negative reinforcement from being used to encourage players to vote a specific way. many alliances have a method by which they can independently tally the votes of their membership. some alliances and corporations will even kick players who cannot prove they voted a specific way. alliance wide ballot maps are a norm, instead of individuals voting individually for who they think best represents them.you should not be able to leverage a position of power in-game to directly influence voting patterns. indirectly is perfectly fine however these last 2 elections have been anything but. alt accounts are a very contentious issue because almost everybody has them. i do not think that alts should ever be prohibited from voting. i do however feel that creating a bunch of accounts months in advance for the sole purpose of using them to vote is beyond the pale."
