9/1/2011,"thanks for your support.i disagree with the 'locked only' or 'selected only' filters because small gangs means quick action, you have seconds to react if a tackler comes for you, you don't want to miss it because you hadn't selected it. clutter should be reduced enough using the overview rules to show/hide the vectors. it could however be added as an additional overview rule, so you have the option but you don't have to use it.about the limit, consider that after all each ship drawn on screen is already quite a number of lines (and textures), it doesn't seem reasonable to me that one more vector per ship may slow down the client. what shenanigans are you thinking about?"
9/1/2011,"hi demichael and allfirstly a big thank you on the onset for all the gigantic work you have posted so far which has helped stabilise and raise simultaneously factional standings on all fronts.i would also support your recommendations on either options about the re-institutions of former tutorial agents in the form of new political agents, as you recommended.these agents provided a quick heads-up to factional standings in the early days just by completing a series of 2 simple missions and they provided in such a glimpse in the policital front of factions and factional standings.in that sense i would support their re-institution as in option 2 in an improved way as to have 1 endless battle mission series offered once for each level (1 to 5) for each capsuleer edcation center of each races. as a back-up plan re-institutions of the agents as suggested in option 1 would also be useful and as you say less time consuming as the scipts must be ready.thank you once again for all the work and support you have been in smart missioning as well as the rehabilitation of eroded factional standings.bestpam"
9/1/2011,"ever been in a wormhole? you should try it, then you'd realize how weak you sound right now."
9/1/2011,i have been there and i don't believe that way it works now is good game design.
9/1/2011,no
9/1/2011,cosmetic only
9/1/2011,wow is this still going?i thought it was done....no - i already pay to have fun i dont want some snotty nose rich boy spoiling my $20 of fun!
9/1/2011,no

9/1/2011,totally +1
9/1/2011,"nobody from the csm has even bothered to look at this......is frankly pathetic.i posted it in the assembly hall, with a big proposal on the top.nobody reads anything."
9/1/2011,"i have to agree, something needs to be changed, perhaps something simple.signed, i to would like to see some action taken."
9/1/2011,"vizvig, i think you're missing a few of my points, your numbers on null sec are exaggerated, and your nulli tengu bot phantom pulling in 300 m isk an hour, 23 hours a day, is pure fiction. as far as the risk to reward ratio, you have misunderstood my averages concerning incursionists, and you are comparing bots to players; your analogy is out of context.for reference, a super carrier might be able to rip through a sanctum in 20-25 minutes and generate an income of 120+ m isk per hour; i know a carrier can do about 60 m isk an hour on sanctums. as far as a bot roaming from system to system, scanning down a juicy sites and by luck getting and following a full trail of expeditions leading to loot worth a 1 b + isk ...get your face out of that pipe!you might be waiting around for 1-2 hours to get into a fleet, but that does not mean there are not active fleets rifling through these sites. it only means you are not in a fleet rifling through these sites. aren't you making new friends? your estimate of what an average incursionist might earn in one day is out of context with the average i put forth. i don't think any individual player is running incursions 23/7; but at any given time there are a number of players churning out that level of payout off of incursions. my estimate was that between 160-480 players were engaging incursion sites at any given time over the whole day, not the same 160-480 players over the whole day. i even reduced my payout estimates to accommodate some criticism to suggest that even such a low ball estimate indicates a problem.the elite faction fleets i mentioned, might be displacing your access to incursion fleets. you mentioned that you only pull in 40 m isk when you get around to doing incursions. are you trying to get through the sites as quickly as possible to maximize your return? is your fleet in competition with other fleets in system, which minimizes your access to sites? are you and or whoever you fleet up with experienced or competent with incursions? with out explanation, i have to admit that at face value your 40m an hour seems quite feeble."
9/1/2011,"l'acuto.stop spouting rubbish please, do 00 incursions with a dozen carriers and titans in your own space like all the big alliances, and the payouts are spectacular, and the risks minimal.we have to compete heavily on high sec incursions, 00 are done by the big boys in their big capitals.the problem with eve is that unless you are in a big alliance in 00 small corps are just salvage, and high sec players dont think the reward is worth it."
9/1/2011,"uncertainty of the future is inflaming plex prices (micro transactions) , plex investors are taking advantage of it to raise the value of their product.incursions earning 100m per hour? im a hardcore merchant, i know everything, if any one was making 100m+ per hour in high sec, i would have bin one of the first to find out.the numbers are more along the lines of 300-750m for 16-18 hours of nonstop hardcore high-sec incursion running in a pro group, k bro? im calling bull&*( on your numbers, end of story.perhaps, 1 of the 16 hours the few rare and downright hardcore.. but they are not, i repeat not making 100m per hour, more like half that on good days.... sometimes they get really lucky and monumentally hit that number, sometimes they get very lucky and hit 100m per hour.---some of the idea's about concord where pretty good... how about, allowing people to join sansha npc fleets and actually allow people to engage other people under the sansha colors? the logistics would be a pain to work out but, why not actually turn it into a real sansha invasion?why are you mad?they wont take your maelstrom sniper into the fleet?since you think your special every one including ccp needs to jump around you, let me introduce you to a little secret, get into a logi, and do the missions like every one else who is not specialp.s.your special"
9/1/2011,"seems like i gotta add my 0.02 isk.as a player who has been playing for less than a year (some might call me a noob) i've done many different things to make isk in high-sec and some solo runs into whs.with your average incursion fleet the income is far lower than 100mil isk/h, more in the terms of 50 to 60, even thought i know of some specialised fleets who can get you to 150mil/h, possible, but unlikely and the investment is pretty high as well isk and skill wise (no one will let a not 5/5/5 logi rep their multibil-isk shinies). so yes, when you manage to get into a fleet, considering you didn't make enough friends to get into one fast, there is good isk to be made, even if you are not in the shiny fleets.but, what about the other means to make isk?first mining: all alone? meh. 6-10mil/h maybe. but no why not use several alts to mine? it's no problem to run 8-10 toons mining ice on a single comp if you want to. good isk to be made and you can nearly do it afk. ore is a bit more tricky, but you can still do several accs at once without using bots. so yes, possible to make 50mil per hour here.next running lvl 4s: solo in the right ships blitzing the missions you can surely do 50mil+/h. running in a small fleet of toons more. i use to fly with an arma, a domi and a noctis, so nothing fancy at all and surely gain 40mil per hour just in bounty and reward, much more for the lp, loot and salvage. a former corpmate of mine used to run level 4s with 4-5 toons at once and made up to 200mil/h if he concentrated on running missions.merchanting: well, this is all about controlling the market ofc, you can make no money at all or billions per day depending on how good you are and what kinda funds you can work with.there are so many other possibilities worth mentioning, like pirating, scanning for sites, etc. thought i'll keep it at this for now.conserning the inflation you talk of: the before mentioned things about plex-buyers/sellers sure play a role. another thing would be ppl messing with prices. last week we had the case that all but one of the hs-hubs sold plexes for 7mil higher than the last one. the day after that the prices were raised by 8mil over all, but this time another hub was the one left lower. this is merchants actively messing with prices as they see fit.tl;dr incursions pay good money, but you can get about the same via other means, even in high-sec."
9/1/2011,"there's the complaints about afk cloakers, about removing or not removing local, blah blah... i think, and i'd like to toss this out there, that there's a fairly simple (conceptually) idea that would alleviate many of these perceived issues...1. cloaked ships, when cloaked, disappear from local. you can't see a cloaked ship by any other means, it only makes sense that they're also cut off from these public communication channels. as a result...2. cloaked ships also cannot see local. when cloaked, you can't use local as an intel gathering tool. you either need to decloak to see who's in local or use other means... dscan, probes or even your own eyeballs.3. to prevent this from being abused regarding hot drops, when a ship decloaks there's a delay to being able to fire a cyno, say 30 or 60 seconds hypothetically. this would give someone a fighting chance to try and escape or call for help before the sqaud of supers drops on their heads."
9/1/2011,"one thing this does is eliminate the whole ""afk cloaker"" issue, in two way. first, if the locals can't see the cloaked ship, they won't be *****ing about seeing an afk cloaker in their system. second, it's balanced by the cloaked vessels not being able to simply sit there and passively gather intel... it puts the intel gathering into the 'actively acquired' mode. however, a well-planned cloakie can easily be at a belt or whatever actively watching traffic come and go with no one having a clue as to his presence.it also reduces to a degree the excessively easy intel local gives you. cloaking will cut you off from passive intel, both for and against.most importantly, there's nothing here that would break wormholes. i think it's an idea worth discussion."
9/1/2011,"you know what, i am drunk enough to support this."
9/1/2011,it seems we've both hidden our agenda in the same place ;)
9/1/2011,"people who wanted duels and tournaments, this is their chance, because this mechanic will allow many interesting things.for highsec pirates this would be awesome, especially if you have friends waiting to come in as backup once somebody decides they can take you on. although the really awesome part is that any outsider can just step in and kill you in the middle of a fight, but then again, really experienced people will be counting on it. pirates vs all who dare to step in!"
9/1/2011,"i highly dislike this due to one reason: what is the flavour of such a ship?if it costs more but is not stronger, why would you pay for it?if it costs the same but it is stronger, why would you fly anything else in lowsec or nulsec?if it costs more and is stronger, isk was never really a balancing factor for most people, so look at above?if it costs the same and is as strong, why would you fly it?"
9/1/2011,"i can think of many reasons to fly outlawed ships. for one they can easily be bait ships. as for isk price of it, nothing is yet set in stone, but if it were to cost more than your average ship then i'd say that it would be worth paying any price for some quality highsec pvp action.ccp wanted a good reason and good roles for the new ships, this is it. it is time for those dusty blueprints and new ship designs to be made real. screw t3 frigates, lets do this instead!"
9/1/2011,"i also have no idea if this would be too hard but i like the idea. far too many times have i sat there pondering what it used to be. it would also be better for screen shots and conversation. ""see me there with that myrmidon wreck? yeah that was my first hunting trip"""
9/1/2011,i know they have started doing this very thing. although smaller kills still look like a pile of rubble...the last couple of orcas i blew up looked like a scorched and fragmented orca wreck afterwards.
9/1/2011,litter the universe with the scorched wrecks of our foes!
9/1/2011,"nah, for everything else, we ninja salvagers will clean up the place."
9/1/2011,"there are other things that should have priority, but when the more pressing issues have been resolved (or set on the path to resolution) this would be nice to see indeed."
9/1/2011,"yes, security gains already exist doing incursions, but concord standings would be a nice addition. right now there's only 2 agents that will give a standing boost to concord, and they're a one time only thing. come on ccp, give us a reason to do incursions that ties it into our other eve activities - that's a much better way of integrating new features."
9/1/2011,"as an older player i have been trying to figure out the direction in eve online. in the begining we had neocom, which worked well, had no problems and was a fantastic interface while in space or in station. now we have captains quarters which is full of glitches, no one wants and seldom works. in the begining we had rated agents witch guided the players from agent to agent by skill and training. now we have all agents open and no challange to get new agents cause all agents are the same. in the begining we had learning skills in witch you had to have to be able to train higher skills. now we have nothing, which has led to the id10t error in eve. we use to have a challenging game which took though skill and a little luck to play. now we have an idiots game which anyone can play without much intelligence.please bring back the old eve, i like a challange.p.s. captains quarters is a worthless waste of time and programming."
9/1/2011,"to ccp:there is an old saying, ""if its not broken, don't fix it""why dont you do something radical, bring back the old players while your at it?im not trying to be an arse, but seriously, this is starting to look like the game i came from, the one that is failing... micro charges, walking around stations... whats next? roleplay? ok.. common now... nerfing everything on a daily basis? common now.. dont make me quit this to now."
9/1/2011,poasting in another whining thread.oh and dont count me in when you say 'no one'. you dont know what i do or dont want.
9/1/2011,a fact i'm sure they're completely devastated about...
9/1/2011,"i, for one, am glad theyre moving away from space-related features... ccp mustve read my mind, cause a year ago i remember thinking ""yeah internet spaceships are alright and all, but what i really want is to have my character walking in circles around his room by himself, and wouldn't it be fabulous if i could give him some monocles or fashionable boots with a nice sexy space jacket that i can sit in a station and admire? omg!"""
9/1/2011,"well, you could sit around and admire it, but you can't sit either.the wis interface is ridiculously heavyweight for being more primitive functionally than runescape."
9/1/2011,"it is one thing to introduce vanity crap and all that..flashy items and being able to walk around your ""captains quaters""it's an another with the infernal thing eats memory like a stock pig...then bsod's if you so much as sneeze at your ""mirror"" to customize your fancy nex boots (sarcasm)in-game in-space admidtly has vastly improved... but the incarna package...hoenstly i shut the damn thing off in an effort to undock/redock faster...and get about the job of running my corp.there are thousands of bugs....many many issues that still have not been resolved.i sympathize with the op...but hte features he highlitghted...not so much.... been palying 2 years.... while i'm not happy with the current direction of ccp...its not enough for me to quit over...but im not far from it.i just wish ccp would spend a little more time ""listening"" and less brainstorming microtransaction bull****.and that is simply how i feel.what to make more money? keep your older players around while getting new ones."
9/1/2011,"your only legitimate point is cq being ******ed.learning skills should never have been made if u think otherwise kill yourselfthe agent change helped spread people out, and it standardized mission types, if i want to run courier missions i can go to a courier mission station and get one, instead of having a chance... the only thing i might not agree too is the quality change, but even then it benefits because some agents weren't used because of crap quality.the game still takes skill to play ect. eve is still harsh, its just cq and nex."
9/1/2011,"i support this proposal because its a unique and obviously well thought-out proposal and not a whine about personal opinions that no one really cares about. [/sarcasm]ps: no, learning skills were stupid and thank god they're gone."
9/1/2011,well that was fun...i'll just pat myself on the back and go get a cookie now.not supported...have a nice day!
9/1/2011,agreed...i like that idea. and if they can do eve voice out of game then why not chat channels too?
9/1/2011,you mean you want this: booster pack
9/1/2011,yes...but wired directly into your brain for a more instant and gratifying reaction.
9/1/2011,"suffice it to say that a lot of people disagree with you. the proof is in the pudding: how many blaster ships do you see used in pvp (apart from comedy fleets)?small blasters seem to be ok, if you dont mind going balls-to-the-wall, but large blasters have a real problem if you can't start the fight within scram range. the increase in jump gate sizes (increasing the average distance a ship has to travel to get within blaster range) and decrease in speed have left blaster bs struggling to find a niche outside station-humping.and that's before we even start talking about tracking."
9/1/2011,"i think that blaster could benefit from an ewar module affecting agility (inertia destabilizer), or maybe a script for web replacing the speed reduction with agility reduction at longer range. such a module would give blaster platforms a weapon to fight fast and agile ships without the risk of breaking the balance. agility and speed problem of gallente hull is partialy due to the nanofibers being popular these days and countering armor tank.making hybrid ammo modifying tracking instead of range is, however, a lovely idea ! that would give hybrid guns their originality."
9/1/2011,"as above, use a gatecamp if you want to control who comes in, or form a gang and hunt them down when they get reported.as the defenders, you already have several big advantages, here are just a few examples:1. you can dock to refit, repair or switch ship to counter what the enemy brought.2. you can have cyno jammers, so that you can use caps but your enemy can't.3. you live in the area and know it much better then the enemy. use chokepoints and other similar areas where you can trap someone."
9/1/2011,"yes, this idea may lead to more of a cooperation with others. but the core of the idea is that people should be within view range of other missioners, this would give more of a community feeling. there will also be a natural tention whenever you see other people nearby, especially if they can potentially interfear with your objectives. that tention is what will make missioning more dynamic and engaging."
9/1/2011,"i dont agree. the stakes already have been made higher for lvl 4s. the amount of tank and firepower you need for lvl 4 is much bigger then for lvl 3.i also see that incursions are the answer to your op in terms of intelligent play style.though i support ideas and ways that support teamplay, i must also say that there are players who dont use teamplay as their major style. they come home from work do 1-2 missions and then get off. i for myself dont want to have to wait till i get enough player to actual play the game.in another post i had to point out that even more nerfs (covered or open) to high sec will hurt ccp's wallet. 70% of the player are playing high sec. not all of them do it alone, but i guess alot of them play missions, most of them lvl 4. nerf lvl 4s even more then they had been in the last two years and you cross a breaking point where the game itself will get less attractive.therefore any op with encouraging ideas for teamplay are welcome i.e. like make the bounty double if you are in a fleet in the same pocket - the wrong way would be to half the bounty if you are alone. but none who want to force other players to adopt to their play style. if lvl 4 are to lame to you, then please start doing incursions and let the rest be."
9/1/2011,"i like the idea of a far more engaging and dynamic system, but some folks do like to just mission solo..so, how about a split system where you can choose to do solo missions or (more lucrative due to added requirements) group missions. with the group mission set having the possibility of being sent to either assist or interfere (pvp) with a fleet already doing something. this would have to allow a deadspace area where concord does not go and you dont get gcc, basically as you are effectivly hired to pvp. this would only be allowed in the mission site so aggresions and so on end once you leave site.the group missions may actively require a pvp style of fleet with ecm, tackle and logi support for high level ones. this way it would be consensual as you would have the choice of non group missions (the curent missions, which you can still do as a group anyway but with no pvp posibility element) as you would have to choose to take these missions and the possibilities that come with it."
9/1/2011,"1. won't really help much. they should really go back to the ""belts only respawn on m/f"" method... except maybe veld/scord in 1.0 - 0.8 or something.2. make them ""drop"" salvage (i.e. you need to salvage the wrecks). balance to mainly drop stuffs for drone-related things (rigs or t2)?3. yes, reduce the trash."
9/1/2011,"any further nerf of high sec is not affordable by ccp. btw high sec has already had too much nerfs the last 24 month.high sec reflects the paying player base. over 70% of the user are living here. and about our nullsec citizens... ccp will not have introduced a project to make null sec more independent to take away 25% of their available ores.with more nerfs ccp will loose customers. what i am sure they dont want to have.if you will find buffs that dont nerf other areas (in particular high sec) like a new form of mining in which the ore contains all minerals. on an average price this ore could be around 150 isk /m3, or the drops are of better value here, rate of faction rats increase like shadow serpentis etc."
9/1/2011,at this point who give a dam anyway lol
9/1/2011,pretty good post. he's spot on too.
9/1/2011,"the way i see it, it's possible a rebalancing (as mentioned by ccp greyscale) might serve everyone well. for the most part, when we do get the rare gravs and manage to suck them dry, there's usually an excess of megacyte and not nearly enough of most of the other minerals to maintain production for any period of time. the megacyte winds up being used to finance purchasing lower end minerals to bring into the hole. so, even a 25% reduction in megacyte replaced with a really nice buff to other minerals would likely benefit we hole-dwellers a good bit. i'd of course like to see the buff to lower end minerals exceed the cut to the mega... we're that starved on the lower end. we still need the megacyte for t3 production, this is a basic fact and one reason we won't completely lose megacyte in the holes. you don't want t3 production dependent on null-bunnies that don't mine what they have already, unless of course you're willing to entertain billion isk tengu hulls, etc."
9/1/2011,if you think it is going to be that big a problem just unite all of high-sec players into one alliance and start buying supers.null will die to the wave of death a total high-sec alliance would be. alternatively stop using the market and build your own ships with the materials you can salvage. if the whole of high-sec did so then null would have very little reason to be null sec as the accumulation of wealth would be pointless.it's your sandbox too.
9/1/2011,"hey great idea!!!!!!why not?i want to know what it is actually said on those meetings, not a soviet propaganda piece."
9/1/2011,"for those of you who haven't heard, seleene has made a blog post."
9/2/2011,"st0n3r0d1um,14,8,3,1,27,3,59"
9/2/2011,"thotol,14,8,3,1,27,3,59"
9/2/2011,any improvements on the hud and getting rid of the lists i support.
9/2/2011,"yes, bring back the old icons please!"
9/2/2011,"i am particularly unhappy with 425mm railgun icons - they are black on black background. i can hardly see what the hell it is.the primary purpose of an icon is to allow player to quickly visually identify an object. that means the value of an icon has less to do with fancy art and more to do with having distinctive pattern.when ccp designers make a bunch of new icons, put them all in a grid like the station hangar, stretch it out to at least 10x10 item grid on 1600+ video screen, randomize positions of the items and ask people to identify specific items based on the picture. measure how quickly they respond. if they respond slower and often confuse 2 items, then you know the icon isn't good."
9/2/2011,"+1. it has been said before, some icons are very dark and i can barely see the icons next to my target locks when i have a black background as well."
9/2/2011,"well, your beliefs fail to trump my reality. it's fine as is in wormholes. you don't need to know if there's a cloaked person in your hole. you simply need to assume there is and act accordingly. and no, that doesn't mean curl up in your pos shield and whimper. it means grow a pair, tank your ship a little (haulers especially), and go about your business in an alert manner."
9/2/2011,"it works fine. it forces people to take responsibility for their own safety, rather than offloading it to some infallible intel system.frankly, if cloaked ships are detectable in whs, then before doing leaving pos every sane person would have scanned for cloak sigs and hence know what was going on in their system. it would be just the same as current broken nullsec, complete with afk cloakers. we don't need another region of space as stupid and easy as nullsec."
9/2/2011,"actually, you're the one who is whining. yes you should have to find a station or someplace safe if you are going to go afk. you're just trying to make an excuse. if you go afk for more than 10 or 15 minutes then you should be logged out. most people with even limited intelligence know that if you aren't in a station system then you dock up or go to a pos when you go afk unless you can cloak. you are just trying to defend your ability to cloak up and go afk all day long in an enemy system so you can be a **** with no risk or consequence."
9/2/2011,you are just trying to defend your inability to have balls so you can bot isk with no risk or consequence.
9/2/2011,yes because putting in an afk timeout will stop all the botters. idiot. even limiting cloaks wouldn't stop botters.grow a brain before you accuse people of being botters.
9/2/2011,you desire to play the game without having to use your brain. you are the equivalent of a bot.
9/2/2011,"a lot of bots will dock up and stay docked if there's a neutral in system... this is the power an afk cloaker can have at controlling botting to a degree. if the botter then sets the cloaker to blue, it opens the cloaker to being able to take out the bot's ships.limiting cloaks would have the effect of making life easier for the botters... they wouldn't have to spend as much time docked and could bot more iskies faster."
9/2/2011,thanks for proving my point.back on topic.yes i am aware that bots dock up or pos up when a neut/red is in system. but afk cloakers don't target bot systems for the hell of it. even then the bots usually just change systems for a while. either way i doubt a change to afk mechanics will effect bots at all.
9/2/2011,ill start by saying my spelling sucks live with it.anyway ive been scanning now for a while and the whole system these days is sooo much better than before imo but there is one things that annoys me and thats wormholes and the fact that they dont have a separate tab for wormholes only.so i propose that ccp create a separate tab for wormholes only i believe this will help people in two ways firstly the people looking for wormholes will be able to find them without the hassle of going through a list on other sigs and likewise people looking for sigs but not wormholes will have a less frustrating time constantly finding whs (my record is 9 holes in a single system lots of emorage that day)and now to be trolled out so we will need more gin.
9/2/2011,actually your spelling is rather good. your grammar and punctuation sucks though.to your issue...i am a little confused on where you want this tab to be for wormholes. are you referring to a tab in bookmarks or a tab in the scanner itself. if you mean in the scanner i doubt it will ever happen simply because that would immediately give away what sig is what when scanning a wormhole. as for in the bookmarks...just make a folder.
9/2/2011,"i'll support cosmetic only if i can be buck nekked. otherwise, no"
9/2/2011,"i hear alot of complaining about the super cap blob fest going on and feel more balance is requiredtitan becomes a defensive ship - replace current dd& reintroduce the area affect of dooms day devices with a max range of 50km with less damage but enough to kill fighters an bombers with ease, (makes super pilots think twice about deploying them) 5 minute cyclessupers - increase the bay for holding more bombers (because of the risk of being blow up by titanshulls immune to area of affect dooms day device but vunrable to dread dd's, fighter & bombers get extra damage on structurescarriers - increase fighter bays make immune to all ddoms days, little more ehpdread - give the titans dd device only useable on supers & titans whilst in siege and structures inmmune - little extra ehp but penatlty on bombers damage and immune to area of affect dd'severy capital or super cap counters another if used correctly.not a perfect solution but a base for something to be worked one :)"
9/2/2011,"you have no actual clue or experience with anything you're talking about, do you?"
9/2/2011,"wait... so let me follow your logic here....supers are overpowered, so lets make titans more powerful by bringing back the aoe dd and super carriers more powerful by adding more space for fighter bombers? ummm.... what? wow.... just wow."
9/2/2011,"agreed. not only are they useless, but they require otherwise useless skills to manufacture. ""talocan engineering?"" seriously? why even bother? make cosmos bpc's relevant or just pull them"
9/2/2011,most cosmos modules have the best fitting requirements in their group.
9/2/2011,agreed
9/2/2011,"i gather the lack of expected responses is due to the many interested people's slow, well-thought-out deliberations over the benefits of such a model..."
9/2/2011,it actually doesn't sound like such a bad idea. i can see this being a bit of an exploitable device for fleet ops...both for and against. i would basically just make local an unreliable intel gathering tool. i would support this.
9/2/2011,"how about a slight tweak to your method? a cloaked ship doesn't appear in local but when they activate a mod (not the cloak of course) e.g a probe launcher, on board scanner they pop up, get's rid of the argument about afk cloaking because if they pop up you know they are not afk? also if they don't activate anything apart from a cloak they disappear from local after a couple of minutes??"
9/2/2011,"after having cross-trained in all empire nations ships and weaponry i must say that out of the four gallente guns are the worst. drones compensate a little but not enough, both in pvp and pve. i understand that improving gallente gun dmg/tracking/cap use wouldn't make them distinct, so dear capsuleers and csm members reading this what say ye of special ammo for gallente guns, with effects such as increasing sig radius, range damp, cap drain/others on the target to help spice things a bit?thank you."

9/2/2011,this...
9/2/2011,what would be the point? salvaging is tricky enough u dont need to be picky about your salvage targets. =p
9/2/2011,yeah good immersion. some wrecks dont get salvaged in belts or at gates so it would nicely. the generic wrecks are so non personal...
9/2/2011,i agree that there are more important things to work on but i like the idea anyway. titans and capitals actually leave behind a husk that resembles the ship all busted up. all ships should do exactly this same thing. there would be no increased lag from it. ccp would simply need to change the generic wreck item to something a little more complex for each ship. shouldnt be hard to do at all.
9/2/2011,"yes, it's true that there are more important things to do, but i think they wouldn't give much hard work since most of those models are already in the game. there are specific wrecks even for stations, so pos could have their own wrecks too."
9/2/2011,"at least do something about the animation. the ships go from intact to a little pile of metal scraps in one little flash. no piece-by-piece explosion, nothing. just the instant conversion from ship to wreck.as for ship-specific wrecks, yes, that would actually make sense. capitals have them so i can't see why smaller ships can't. go for it."
9/2/2011,i agree. it would be pretty awesome to see a pod zip out of an exploding wreck as the animation of the explosion is going. explosion animations could be a client side thing that could be turned off and on as well.that would be pretty freaking cool. this deserves some attention ccp!posting with alt for another approval!

9/2/2011,"so efforts have tried to be made to ease those who run missions who were not happy with mission probers jumping into their missions to salvage wrecks, that at least 90% leave behind.so then, since this has not gone any further you will be seeing alot more of us who do this in your missions salvaging the wrecks that more than likely you wil just leave behind anyway.remember we brought a possible solution and it was buried, next time drop a tear somewhere else."
9/2/2011,"i want to take up the idea of the beacon, but......bind it to blue wrecks. every blue wreck should be findable, why else abbandon them in the first place.now for missions. each wreck in the pockets, which remain when someone is turning the mission in without salvaging, should turn into blue wrecks, if not salvaged. by turning blue, they get a beacon and dedicated salvager could find it easier. the strength of the beacon could be bound to the level of the mission. like a lvl 1 is found on first scan and lvl 4 need several circles like to 1 au or sligthly easier (4 au?)important thing is to wait till the mission is turned in. we dont want to rob all our ninja salvager of their fun, having the need to do a bit more tricky scan jobs"
9/2/2011,"i don't see any problems with how things already are. you can already find mission runners, you can already wiat for them to finish and leave, you can already loot and salvage what they leave behind. what... you want it to be easier for you to steal other people's loot? too effing bad. you can salvage the wrecks without aggression... if you're going to take the chance on grabbing their loot as well you should accept the risk associated with that.the salvager profession is already lucrative enough for those with balls. those without can come back when they grow a pair. your free lunch is the wrecks. the loot has risk.as far as scanning wrecks... no. you're either on the ball with finding them or you're not."
9/2/2011,now ^this is a good idea! do that! no this is not a troll.
9/2/2011,"no. not looking for a ""free lunch"". ye things should stay as they are in the sense of being agressed when looting wrecks, however should we be agressed when they clearly dont want the wrecks? however it is those wrecks that are left behind after the mission has been turned in and the pilots are long gone.nah i dont mind jumping a mission and cargo scanning the wrecks to see what i may want and be agressed for it.i beleive where all this stemmed from was a thread about pilots being agressed even for salvaging wrecks in missions or not.(pvp,missions, and what not).i am agressed plenty of times... no worries. this is about those wrecks after missions are turned in and the pilot is long gone, this is where salvagers want to find those wrecks without having to scan down ships/drones and jump into someones mission(s)."
9/2/2011,"instead of going full ****** and demanding ccp create a mod that does the exact same thing in the exact same way as another mod already does, lets try and theorise how one could increase gallente leadership mods utility in general.as pointed out, several mods exist that improve tanking. why not have a gallente mod that improve damage instead? or tracking? or range?these, combined with the much needed look at hybrid weaponry in general, could bring gallente back to par with the other races again. if it was done well it wouldnt even be hilariously imbalanced."
9/2/2011,"i disagree that damage boosting would be good for leadership. it would make things like pos bashing, station capture, etc easier, which is not a good thing.i was pondering about things like drone durability or drone speed boosting. not sure if it would be worth a command slot though."
9/2/2011,"increased optimal and tracking of hybrids? blaster supremacy!increased drone navigation and sharpshooting? (heavies moving as fast as warriors, oh yeah!) :)"
9/2/2011,"while i agree it needs a lot more thought than i have put into it, i (in general terms) think it might be possible to pull off...i dont necessarily see stations being easy to take being a problem, as being hard to take is part of the reason 0.0 is supercarriers online at the moment, which is all manner of dumb. that said, i prefer the tracking aspect.in any case, i would think the bonus would have to be something suited to the supposed gallente warfare style, which is, as i understand it, high close range dps from blasters and drones, with armour tanking. now, armour tanking is ofcourse already covered, which leaves some close range weapon or drone effect the ideal route to my mind.what say you?"
9/2/2011,"why not make it activity based? whatever alliance has the most players active in a system has ""sovereignty"" for as longa s they can maintain that activity, meaning alliances can only hold as much sov as they can keep active players, and if they spread out too far, people will just come in and claim there systems.this would break up big alliances, or at elast reduce blobbing, because in order to keep your systems you need to keep your players relatively spread out and your teritories more condensed.yes, this idea could use refining, but i think it could be a building block to start with."

9/2/2011,easier - just hand out lp's and put all of this stuff into the lp store. there you can buy what you want. though i dont think the mindlink would come cheap. guessing it would cost about 450k-500k lp
9/2/2011,"taking the shear cost of super carriers in account and the inability to balance things in any likeness to reality(ie a ship that size ould have so many gun batteries on it to deal with smaller vessels) the current neuting defence against hic's and dics are fairly well balanced imo. some people are saying that it is a risk free ganking tool. but that is only if you are reckless. the whole idea of 0.0 is to be high risk, nothing is stopping you from dropping your own supercapital fleet or a fleet of neuting tempests onto a ganker.look at the amout of carriers that would be required to take down 1 super carrier. if they are in a remote repping chain then a single sc will be sure of not killing them and dying. permitted you can get it bubbled, it is not a buff feature it is a balancing feature.8 carriers to a super carrier, you have a fight and they all die, the carrier pilots get insurance payout of 50% of ship and fit, supercaps don't get to have platinum insurance. if don't want groups with 50 supercaps floating about and pawning everything in their way. don't weaken ships that are only able to counter what they are worth but create a game culture where there would be no benefit in controlling half the map for precious moon goo. but rather that you wil have smaller groupsdefending their own small space where they can generate enough income that it is only worth taking if you can populate it heavily and thus get the isk out."
9/2/2011,"balancing on cost alone has been a failed argument since 2006. in an era when a single tech moon provides an income of billions of isk per week, then arguing that a ship that costs 50 times as much should be able to take on 50 times as many is simply nonsensical. t2 cruisers cost 50 times as much as a t1 cruiser, but no-one with half a brain thinks that they should be able to take on 50 t1 cruisers and survive."

9/2/2011,"first a disclaimer-er: this is more of a feeling i got when i was at pax. my husband loves eve and everything it embodies. i never play, but i too also love eve (more so now that i've got to chat in depth with various players, at the totally awesome and striperless eve party. -i'm about as straight as a girl gets, i don't want to see any of that going on).but the one thing that really bothered me was how apologetic some of the presentations were: like ""eve isn't difficult, eve isn't just a game for advanced gamers""**** yes eve is difficult, **** yes dedication pays off in eve. you don't like it? play world of warcraft. you don't like that the game changes? see previous answer. personally, i have a pile of emotional issues that keeps me from pvping in any sort of persistent world (1st person shooters and board games are the only places i compete). i can't take the heat? fantastic... i have lotro or minesweeper. so... don't appologize for eve. it is an amazing -a-m-a-z-i-n-g game based on an amazing philosophy that produced an amazing procedure for (eventually) making the best game in the universe, that has already brought together a fantastic (if not slightly whiny) community. so when you are in your eve booth, presenting (like you do) focus on the chance for change, the ability for people to affect the world, and the vision of what game the game developers want it to be. game devs don't agree? fantastic. have a debate, let the audience ask questions and suggest things during the debate. also, i don't understand why you feel the need to apologize for the complexity of your game. do you want dedicated players or not? did you make all this complexity and really expect a bunch of casual gamers to say that they have time for it? because they won't. and that's ok because....the eve tournaments are my favorite part. i love that it takes a serious amount of skill and dedication to compete (and win) the tournament, and i am really excited that so many people are willing to do this (so i don't have to) for my entertainment. which when you think about it... it's a lot like football. football makes a lot of money. i want to see eve make a lot of money so they can implement all my more expensive ideas. implant the idea of football for nerds in your collective heads and... go! (eve should be capitalizing on its universe more than it is but not so much as to be too annoying.)lastly, don't get caught up in the fact that you receive a lot of complaints (that's all i heard from everyone the entire time i was stalking -and not talking to- the game devs at pax).just give them better ways to give feedback (you've already implemented some things that work but i think a little more creativity might be needed to really solve the issue. these are going to be the worst suggestions i've ever had (please forgive me), but i'm a usability designer/psychologist at heart so i have to try. - have a/b testing on your test servers. i'm not expecting you to put a ton of work into an incarna level of programming and then ab test incarna/no incarna, but for things like balance issues (that everyone talks about) maybe being able to change a hull value and letting people comment on it might be really valuable.- also. (this really will be my worst suggestion - i love it)a tabletop rpg game: (being crazy is a good time, you should try it). my reasoning is this. if (big if) you are able to mimic the dynamics of eve in a game like d&d, then people might be able to find their own balance/game play options and share them back with ccp. (hey even bad ideas can inspire genius ideas in smarter people...right?)otherwise, seriously, just make another game (parallel to eve)...preferably one with trees...and cute fuzzy animals. i'd totally play that. but it's ok if you don't. i have that warcraft thing if i get desperate."

9/3/2011,"i do get so tired of this 'adapt or die' rubbish, which is exactly what it is. i still pvp a lot, and i'm still successful at it, i can adapt however i don't think the adaptions that i and a lot of small scale pvpers have had to make are for the better, small scale pvp has gotten worse since this game was brought in through various changes. forget the capital proposal, i'll remove that after this post. material sink is good for the economy, yes it does create isk but less isk is created than the value of minerals and build parts required to build the ship which are permanently removed from game, overall i feel helping the economy, but i'm not economist and thats not even the primary point i was trying to make.my point is that rr is currently overpowered, if you are in a 10-15 man gang, yes you can bring logistics, a lot of the time we will, but more often than not any larger gang will have even more logistics rendering you useless resulting in the majority of pvp being ganks. unless you know what you will be fighting before you come across it then it is very hard to counter every sort of logistics gang you come up against. with regards to spider tanking, i just realised my choice in words was poor but that does not change the fact that spider tanking carriers and supercarriers are a real issue, they get thrown at small roaming gangs all the time and just sit there and smile while you can do nothing.there are whispers at ccp about changing remote reps believe it or not, they will be changed in the future.with regards to the expected goon troll, i'm not trying to ram my pvp style down your throat, i'm trying to make it viable, and yes i do want smaller groups to be able to punish 150 man gangs if those gangs are poorly led, poorly fitted and poorly flown. why shouldn't skill be rewarded and lack of skill punished.clearly people don't like the idea of rr being used only on the class for which their module size would suggest, perhaps there is another answer, some suggestions on here have been good.but for those wanting to keep no risk cheap pvp with their drake fleets and dozen scimitars i hope your days are numbered and i hope ccp will do the sensible if unpopular thing."
9/3/2011,"also thankyou gizznitt for your post and link, i would just like to highlight some quotes from the blog which will hopefully show why i'm even making these proposals:ccp want the same thing i do, they just don't quite know yet how to get there, i believe remote repair is one of many problems with combat in the game that needs addressing. also i have changed my opening post to reflect points and suggestions from posts in this thread."
9/3/2011,"what, you mean make it a target painter that does damage?yeah, i could see that, it would have to do slightly less damage and be maybe as or slightly more effective then a target painter, though it would ahve to be you shoot, hit, increases sig radius, but if you stop shooting it is no longer debuffed, and if you miss it does not reduce its sig radius, only make the effect last just long enough to fire another cycle that way if you start missing (liek if your a bc and its a frig) it'll still have a chance."
9/3/2011,you do realize blasters are best guns around? caldari gunboats are most ****ed cos they don't get damage even with blasters.it's other things than guns like tracking enhancers and ridiculous ship speed which makes minmatar so good.
9/3/2011,"how about instead we get rid of all currency and replace it with debt?that way when you need something from somebody you can trade them tyhe debt someonme else owes you.personally i think this would reflect a true economy more effectively, since in the real world theres no such thing as ""currency"" just pieces of paper informing you how much of your country's debt is your fault."

9/4/2011,it's actually above average quality for en24.
9/4/2011,"i wanted to put my simple idea in a straight forward and simple manner, so i fired up mspaint and went to town!please visit your user settings to re-enable images. please visit your user settings to re-enable images.the idea is simple, when using blasters if a target gets inside your optimal your critical hits start to do more damage than normal, and at point blank range, let say 100m your critical hits will do up to 4 times more damage than a normal critical.this change gives blasters a big damage boost but only when certain criteria are met so it's not over powered. the only chanage to blaster boat set ups might be more tracking mods and more webs.as for a rail gun fix, my idea for this is a bit extreme but, meh welcome to eve.rail guns should only really be put on sniper ships, harpy, moa, eagle, rokh for example and used in sniper set ups. sniper set ups use up quite a few mid and low slots to do well and hurt the ships tanking potential, so i think a critical bonus should be a good way to boost rails and sniping as a tactic.small rails-if optimal is > 100km and-target is with in %2 of optimal range then-chance to do up to 12 times normal damage criticalmedium rails-if optimal is > 150km and-target is with in %2 of optimal range then-chance to do up to 12 times damage normal criticallarge rails-if optimal is > 200km and-target is with in %2 of optimal range then-chance to do up to 12 times normal damage criticalagain as much as this looks over powered it's not because of the very strict conditions that must be met. for example if a sniper rokh with a 210km optimal warps to a 200km book mark off a gate then only targets with in %2 of it's optimal are at risk of get smacked with a super crit, and a smart fc is going to know that if he moves his ships with in the 200km requirement then their will be no way the rokh can hit them for a super crit.anyway those are my ideas on how to both fix hybrids and give them their own unique flavor.lasers do not run out of ammo and have insta reload.artillery has many damage types, don't require cap, and have the highest alpha.missiles never miss, have all damage types, and do the same damage at any range.hybrids have none of these so lets give them a super crit chance.if you have read my whole post then thank you."
9/4/2011,"keep in mind that, right now, critical hits only happen in 1% of all shots fired (unless your chance to hit per shot fired is less than 1%, in which case all hits are critical hits). also, critical hits do 3 times average damage, whereas normal hits randomly vary between 0.5 times and 1.5 times average damage (though if hit chance is low, most of those hits will be closer to 0.5 times average damage than to 1.5 times average damage)."

9/4/2011,"nothing can fix the fact that newbie doesn't know what all stuff he can do, it's about finding it out. it doesn't help to give more stuff when they don't know even 10% of stuff they can do at first place. i am not sure if it's trolling or not (trolol?) but i've seen growing numbers of whines about new player can't do this and that when there's maybe 100x stuff newbie can do nowadays compared to like 2007. and that good old i cannot do anything i have only 1mil sp."

9/4/2011,"i am blessed with a good job, with lots of responsibility. i live on a nice farm with my wife and 2 kids. we have some horses and some sheep and some dogs and 3 cars. i have been playing eve on and off since the start. i have also been playing other online games on and off since the start, including eq, eq2, uo, wow, wwiionline... so thats around 20 years of online gaming (+/- a bit). this little intro is meant to let you know that i, as many other eve players, have a full life outside eve, and that eve is not an important part of my life, but rather a nice addition.this is my life in eve:i like to play challenging pve. if i had the time or the isk, i would now and then like to venture out to low-sec, and see if i could be succesful in some pvp. the problem is, that i dont have the time to read a lot of background, or take two years of pvp-university, so when i go to low-sec i usually get pod-killed within the first 10 minutes.then i have to find new isk, to be able to do lvl 4 missions. well since it would take me 2-3 month to do that, and i really dont want to spend my valuable playing time, grinding all the time, then i end up buying some isk by selling these gametime plex-things.now i planned to try a lvl 5 mission, since lvl 4 missions has become a bit too easy for me, and because i would like to make more money and have more challenge.i had to find an agent in 0.4 sec space. when i docked out from the 0.4 station, i got pod-killed by 4 pirates waiting for me. they probably had fun, but i can look forward to either go out and buy some more isk or grinding the next many times i have time to play, until i have enough again for a good ship.(btw: i dont get the idea of having 0.4 space and 0.0 space, when the risk is the same.. shouldnt at least the station protect in and outgoing traffic in 0.4? )what is the consequence?well for me it is, that i dont dare to try the lvl 5 missions i would really like to do to get more pve challenge, because i am forced to pvp at a time when i am not fit for it.do i find that fun? no!now i will go back and do some highsec lvl 4 missions, and if it goes like the other times, when i go bored, then i quit eve again. and in a year or two i come back and stay for a few months, to see if pve has been improved.am i whining? well maybe. but i think a lot of players like me, would stay playing for a much longer time, and even start enjoy pvp now and then, if we could get the opportunity to build up something, which had a fair chance in 0.0, without having to quit the job and the family, to go on the eve-university and have no other life.i am here to be happy and challenged, but not to make some hardcore players happy on my own expense. that is simply naive.i am a seldom guest in the forums, since i would much more like to fly a spaceship. there is no reason to start shouting at me, since i probably wont see it. but if you understand what my message is, maybe there is a chance that more occassional players will enjoy now and then being cannonfodder for you hardcore people.brtrollo"

9/5/2011,"so how do we allow these small-corp, independent industrialist dreamers to emmigrate to 0.0 and setup their own ""outposts""?it seems there needs to be a way to have a sort of ""small-corp"" sov mechanic ... places where only small gangs of ships can fly .... out of the way places where it's possible for a small gang to defend and be attacked by other small gangs ... places where the daily cap ship / drake blob can't simply come in and control everything.proposal:""small-gang nullsec regions""observation:wildlife always thrives best around the ""borders"" of varied terrain ...goal:increase the variety of ""habitat"" available in eve (and in particular create more ""border areas"" around nullsec), to create a more thriving ""ecosystem"" where ""wildlife"" can live and evolve ...currently all(?) nullsec systems are connected by stargates. also, cap ships are able to jump to all(?) systems (jb's or jd's). due to this, large alliances are able to project power without limits ... which leads to a single vast ""nullsec wasteland"" where all territory is held by a few large alliances, and with no diversified playing field allowing for small gang warfare, since a drake or cap ship blob is always just a cyno away at any time (so everyone gravitates into similar blobs).losec may have been intended as a ""border region"" but it's actually just an even more deadly ""no man's land"".from what others have said, nerfing jf's, jb's would work against the idea of ""attracting and keeping players in nullsec"" due to difficulty of logistics ...learning from the success of wh's at encouraging small gang behaviors though perhaps we could create ""small gang nullsec regions"".these would be territories, isolated somewhat from ""normal"" nullsec space somehow ... either by severely restricting stargate/jump travel to them, or by making gates/jump drives somehow scale with (major) sov mechanics (i.e.-you can attack a growing neighboring territory/alliance of small gang regions with your cap fleet/blob, but you might have to build a larger road or upgrade the infrastructure to get there).major regions of nullsec would be tied together by major transport routes (as today) ... but there would just be smaller out of the way regions where major blobs/fleets simply couldn't go (without building a bigger road so to speak).as such ""small-gang"" regions grow in power, they could then move to/join larger alliance space ...sure, resources wouldn't be as abundant as where the ""cap blobs"" fly ... but some people don't care as much about wealth, as they do independence ...these small-gang regions would encourage small gangs of miner corporations, for example, to produce minerals and manufacture things, so sell at nearby ""large alliance"" trade hubs ...the other nullsec issues (mineral balance, manufacturing slots, etc.) would still need to be addressed, but at least there would be a way for small gangs to participate ..."
9/5/2011,i didn't read every response but the only way i see of making a rival to jita for null sec players would be to have some of the faction space a defacto hi sec. where -10 players can go without concord problems and the faction polices any aggro in their system. this space would be entirely seperated from any empire with the only way in through true 0.0. the system should allow for cynos like any other null sec so jf can jump in to provide the necessary goods for sale. naturally all gates to such a system would be camped to hell so possibly a small cluster of systems 3-4 would work.i think this would create an extremely attractive hub for null sec. flame expected
9/5/2011,very interesting .... got me thinking ... but then it seems so much like ... jita ... hmmmm ... what's wrong with jita again?seriously tho ... more trade hubs could be cool?

9/5/2011,"this idea is far better than magic obelisks to claim space or magic upgrades to attract signatures, which i must admit was some improvement over pos spam sov.i like the attempt in this idea to make sov more of a result of player action and activity and less of a goal.hypothetically, in a system where two alliances are fighting over a system with jump bridges, cynosural generators, and cynosural jammers, there is the possibility of spam tactics. basically as an alliance is losing, say a cynosural jammer, they could offline it and online one somewhere else in the system; sort of a wild goose chase defense. a time delay could be incorporated into these structures detrimental to whomever's structure is lost (becomes incapacitated) or off-lined, perhaps a ten minute timer. more consideration is required for situations involving multiple alliances, especially two coalitions of multiple alliances fighting over a system.with one structure as the focus of contest, fleets have more impetus to meet ...with blob and lag the remaining concern.as far as timezone considerations, it takes a fair amount of time anchor and set up a pos let alone organize an invasion. if an alliance doesn't notice a host of hostiles establishing control towers in their system, then they aren't using it and deserve to lose it."
9/5/2011,"(tl;dr - nice idea, but need to avoid farming for sov pitfalls)i love the idea but...how do you avoid the ""flog me to death to get sov"" syndrome?let me explain.alliance 1 wants sov over a system owned by alliance 2 - so they get buddies in corp 1 to deploy large fleet of disposable ships which they destroy in that system.alliance 1's sov index skyrockets. they gain sov. without even having to fight alliance 2...yeah i know twisted. but then so are some players of eve i know."
9/5/2011,"tl;dr summary:1) nex merchandise is pointless since nobody else can see it.2) incarna in its current form (aka cq) is a massive waste of time that hurts everyone.3) nex clothing should not cost more than rl clothing.we all get where ccp is going with incarna. it's a great addition to the game that's long overdue and what many new players have been asking for. we get that. however what we currently have is captains quarters. a massive project that look a long time to develop. yay great, i can walk around by myself in this lone office and sometimes look at my active ship (assuming it's not glitched out which most of the time it is). and that's about it. all that time and effort that went into developing this expansion and yet its content only lasted 5 minutes before we've seen it all. lame with cq, we also got the noble exchange. a way for players to break up plex into a new currency called aur. great, but the main problem with this is that cq is a single player experience which entirely defeats the purpose of vanity sales. why spend real money for ingame money used for character clothing purchases when nobody else can see? releasing the nex with cq was a bad idea. it should be removed and reintroduced when players can eventually interact with each other. currently it's just a waste.speaking of nex, the prices are just plain bad. we've all heard how awful they are but people generally like to see it for themselves so here's a few numbers to give you an idea of just how bad it really is:ironically, a shirt at wal-mart is cheaper than a shirt from the nex. not much needs to be said about the infamous monocle as it's so often used as the point of reference in arguments against ccp. ccp needs to reevaluate the prices (aka bring them down). at their current prices there's nothing micro about these transactions at all. not by any stretch of the imagination. especially since many of the vanity items cost more than the game itself."
9/5/2011,"omg don't take away my space ken dress up doll!!! but seriously yeah, they need to drop prices on it, or even better would be if they focused instead on fixing the space-related parts of the game that need some work, or at least if youre gonna have vanity items make them things for your ship, like being able to paint your ship certain colors/designs or add other vanity items to your ship, like searchlights or ability to make design changes (by that i mean changes to appearance, absolutely nothing that would actually increase performance)"
9/5/2011,"whatever. the line ""everything is risky, no one should feel safe"" is something afk cloakers use ad nauseam. using their own words, even they shouldn't feel safe enough to drop in a ship, cloak and be gone for the next 23.5 hours.thing is, a cloaker which doesn't seem to do anything might not be afk at all, but busily logging the activity in the system. if he's doing it at all himself and haven't set up a bot to do such a thing."

9/5/2011,"first i am going to apologize, i only made it 5 pages before my eyes started bleeding and my brain cried for a little reason to be heard. so if my points have been addressed i am sorry. second, i am not going to cite anyone specific as i am not trying to point fingers. so on to my points.""disrupted productivity"": this is bull****, the only person costing your supposed productivity is your own response, not the afker. you are choosing to be disrupted by his presence. you are failing to do your own intel gathering. you are afraid he might spot a cyno or appear suddenly in a stealth bomber. does he have a record of flying sb? does his corp/alliance have a record of cyno warfare? do you even know?! you are being reactionary in a proactive game. fraps/screen reader/etc: yes, these tools can be used to gain an unfair advantage (by that i mean any advantage gained while not actively playing the game) and should likely fall under the category of botting however they are purely passive and cant detected or enforced and could just as easily be performed by someone that has a half dozen monitors and adhd. the intel they gather and the ""method"" (sitting cloaked off the gate(s)) are perfectly legit and shouldnt be nerfed because some people are going to cheat.""omgs nerf cloaks!!1!"": stfu, please. nerfing long term and long distance recon and/or making them annoying (randomly clicking ""yes i want to stay cloaked"" as an example) is a really dumb and bad idea. intel is central to any war, read the art of war if you dont believe me, and making the job of your intel gathering agents harder is just about the worst thing you could do.""nerf local in 0.0"": in my understanding of the game mechanics the local channel is loosely tied to the stargates, hence why whs don't have an accurate one. the only reasonable change i could see to local in nulsec would be to remove/delay the appearance of people who arrived in system by non-stargate means. however that would strengthen cloaks so no one hear whats to hear that idea =pi believe i have covered all of the reverent points however i can edit if after another eye bleeding 5 pages of trolling, stupidity, whining and ignorance i find another or two.two responses to the next 5 pages, i would totally support an anti-cloak class of ship, not only does it resolve the afk cloaker ""problem"" but it would make for fantastic games of cat and mouse, especially if all it told you was there was a cloaked ship not what cloaked ship. i would also support an afk flag, not for anything in this thread but because im sick of asking ""hey sonso, you there?"" =p"

9/5/2011,"hello test and all the other mega alliances that hire just anybody. as a former iac member who felt just the same way back in 2007 when they rolled out covert ops ships, i too share this hatred for exploiters. why can't people afk mine / belt rat in 110% safety. this blatant exploit has gone far enough. its not like isk generation has any direct relation to tactical advantages. purchasing power means nothing, and if people can't mine/rat constantly, how will their alliance ever hold space. come on people, think about this. as miang hawaa points out, anything that is possible while afk'd is an exploit.when i jump into 6vdt and i see 110 in local and all i have is a cheetah, i'm pretty scared, but then i realize that there are only about 5 or 6 people active, and everyone else is just afk in the station or in their pos. this false sense of numbers in local is very misleading. if you're not actively clicking something you should be logged out and then your account banned for 23.5 hours. that will teach you to afk, right? this blatant exploit has gone on long enough. players should not be allowed to have a tactical advantage while afk at any point. false local numbers has been a problem for a very long time. everyone knows its a problem. why hasn't anything been done? what is being done about this frustrating problem?"

9/5/2011,"the biggest question would be ""who is 'them' in the last sentence?"" apart from some scattered forum postings, i wouldn't be able to name one, much less associate current members or candidates to policies they support.you state that it would only take five minutes of my time. but without some knowledge, voting is rather pointless.nobody (at least nobody i know) likes political advertising. but it does serve some purpose to make the candidates known to the people. or is it that the current and prospective members of the csm do like their proceedings mired in secrecy and keeping the masses uneducated?"
9/5/2011,"no, at least not in hisec. a group of players have got together to try and inform and encourage hisec residents to vote for candiates who will represent their interests in the next csm election. this is on simmer at the moment but things are happening. contact either me or lakitel if you are interested in getting out the vote next election and we will will be happy to discuss what needs to be done."
9/5/2011,"the opportunity to vote for the csm was presented equally to all players. these postings by a few highly vocal hisec carebears utterly ignores the fact that if your concerns were both as important to the player base and as widespread as you purport them to be, then the voting would have reflected that and the csm composition would be different than it currently is. it played out in this way for a simple reason: people are far more likely to vote in these things when angry... the majority of hisec dwellers are content with things there as is, while the majority of nullsec players are very upset with the way things there currently operate. therefore, if you have one group of people demanding change with another group content, youre gonna work on pacifying the angry group rather than throwing carrots to those who are currently content.i think the fact that these anti-csm threads are so relatively few in compared to the large number of hisec dwellers and the fact that these threads seem to be consistently driven by the same few people is actually quite telling...."
9/5/2011,"if he gets no benefit from having a presence in hisec, then why is he there? and if he does have a reason to be there why should he not care about it? ah, sorry, i see where you seem to be going with this. you appear to think that if ccp, at the instigation of the csm, shifts all of the advantages found in other sectors of the game into 0.0 then that will make the game ""fairer"" and ""more balanced""wouldn't be a 0.0 resident yourself, would you?"
9/5/2011,"where did i say or infer that he has no benefit from living in hisec? clearly he does. let's see if i can explain this to you:why mine ice or low-ends in 0.0 and risk your mackinaw on every undock when you can mine it under the protection of concord?why research blueprints in 0.0 where the stations are few and takeable and pos's are vulnerable to caps and supercaps when you can research it in 0.0, when you can research in total safety in hisec?why manufacture goods, why build t2, etc, etc. most null players have multiple hisec alts because it's simply impractical and non-profitable to do day-to-day logistics and industry in 0.0. in truth, it's these hisec alts that are the cornerstone of 0.0 functionality. however given the option, they would prefer not needing any of their alts in hisec. and they vote accordingly. yeah dude, if you're going to have one zone that has huge risk and the other have zero risk, balancing the reward that comes with risk is rather crucial. otherwise you end up with lowsec."
9/5/2011,"wh's severely lack trit, pye, mex, even if you mine everything you get.i like the idea of removing local from 0.0 to even things out ..."
9/5/2011,"true .... but then ccp should listen to the 80%/+ of players that live in hisec .... instead of catering to the hardcore 0.0 minority. people have voted very strongly with their feet ... hisec is where people spend most of their time. i'm betting a fair balance can be found so that both groups can enjoy the game ... i just don't appreciate the current attitude of ""hisec people don't matter and are ruining the game for the poor 0.0 people"".what does nullsec have to attract anyone? --> your whole life is controlled by some big alliance, no freedom really, and all for what, the opportunity to participate in large (laggy) fleet battles?here's an idea ... make more wormholes! higher risk than 0.0 (no local and no blue blobs to protect you, logistics more difficult), but they allow people to learn pvp and participate in nullsec type activities, but maintain the freedom of a small corp.is this why the 0.0 alliances see wh's as such a threat to them? --> it's a way for people to maintain their freedom from the alliances?"
9/6/2011,"definitely a good idea. and please leave the movement indicators visible for all of the ships in the tactical overlay, especially in fleet battles it would help to track the movements of the squads in relation to you and each other.perhaps the tactical overlay could be made configurable in regards what elements are shown for all ships/the selected ship or not at all?"
9/6/2011,"i wanted to put my simple idea in a straight forward and simple manner, so i fired up mspaint and went to town!please visit your user settings to re-enable images.please visit your user settings to re-enable images.the idea is simple, when using blasters if a target gets inside your optimal your critical hits start to do more damage than normal, and at point blank range, let say 100m your critical hits will do up to 4 times more damage than a normal critical.this change gives blasters a big damage boost but only when certain criteria are met so it's not over powered. the only chanage to blaster boat set ups might be more tracking mods and more webs.as for a rail gun fix, my idea for this is a bit extreme but, meh welcome to eve.rail guns should only really be put on sniper ships, harpy, moa, eagle, rokh for example and used in sniper set ups. sniper set ups use up quite a few mid and low slots to do well and hurt the ships tanking potential, so i think a critical bonus should be a good way to boost rails and sniping as a tactic.small rails-if optimal is > 100km and-target is with in %2 of optimal range then-chance to do up to 12 times normal damage criticalmedium rails-if optimal is > 150km and-target is with in %2 of optimal range then-chance to do up to 12 times damage normal criticallarge rails-if optimal is > 200km and-target is with in %2 of optimal range then-chance to do up to 12 times normal damage criticalagain as much as this looks over powered it's not because of the very strict conditions that must be met.for example if a sniper rokh with a 210km optimal warps to a 200km book mark off a gate then only targets with in %2 of it's optimal are at risk of get smacked with a super crit, and a smart fc is going to know that if he moves his ships with in the 200km requirement then their will be no way the rokh can hit them for a super crit.anyway those are my ideas on how to both fix hybrids and give them their own unique flavor.lasers do not run out of ammo and have insta reload.artillery has many damage types, don't require cap, and have the highest alpha.missiles never miss, have all damage types, and do the same damage at any range.hybrids have none of these so lets give them a super crit chance.if you have read my whole post then thank you."
9/6/2011,"this blatant exploit has gone on long enough. players should not be allowed to have a tactical advantage while afk at any point. this defines exploit. everyone knows it is a problem. it has been for a very long time. why has nothing been done?what is being done about this frustrating problem? how can we possibly be expected to gank carebears when they all just run off to their pos'?i propose that afk carebears, or carebears hiding in pos' should periodically be kicked from their pos and sent back to the belt/sanctum that they were ratting in."
9/6/2011,"there are plenty enough isk opportunities for corps and alliances in null-sec. it needs to be more attractive to the rank-and-file industrialists who don't own a pos (which usually means don't have access to research and production lines), don't have their own cyno capital, don't have rorqual support and aren't part of a corp dedicated to mining."

9/6/2011,"well, something has to be done. new turret icons just lack the crisp, shine and recognition of the old ones. i suppose it's because old icons were pixelwork while new ones are straight off render.so, if there is no intention to make new icons look better, old icons are prefferable solution."

9/6/2011,"i don't understand: why does every ammo have at least a couple damage types i.e explosive, kinetic, thermic, em; except hybrid that has (drum roll) thermic and kinetic only; theres no getting away from it, if you're fighting against a gallante ship; hes using thermic or kinetic; otherwise hes not using his ship bonus. not to mention if your out in null say against the angel cartel and they're weak against explosive and strong against thermic and kinetic, you have to lose your ship bonuses. on a side bar why have 8 different types of hybrid ammo, not to mention factions, if they all basically do the same damage just slightly less power usagei suggest as a balance make different damage types for hybrid ammo"
9/6/2011,"tl;dr addressing cyniac's sov farming loop holecyniac, interesting loop hole. if i understand your scenario correctly corp 1 is not part of alliance 2. i suppose if alliance 2 holds sov, alliance 2 has to receive the flogging to destabilize or lose it's sov. if alliance 2 ships are not being destroyed and structures are not being incapacitated, should unaligned kills in system mean anything? aside from that, the continuous presence of alliance 1 and corp 1 should by itself contribute to destabilizing the sov of alliance 2 by deterring alliance 2's use of the system, but should their presence alone be a factor itself? could alliance a blob alliance b's system and eventually flip it? why not? gaining sov and keeping sov are two different tricks.your scenario also begs a few questions. what is alliance 2's response to alliance 1? how does alliance 2 have sov established?let's say the minute alliance 2 responds to the presence of alliance 1 and corp 1, alliance 1 and corp 1 leave or log off. what does that mean? could that be interpreted as the route of alliance 1 by alliance 2? let's say alliance 1 engages alliance 2 after accruing all those corp 1 kills, but loses. why not interpret either of those cases as alliance 2 > alliance 1 > corp 1, basically nullifying corp 1 kills' value to alliance 1? if alliance 1 defeats alliance 2 what's the point of all the corp 1 kills? if corp 1 never engages alliance 2 how could you compare alliance 1 vs corp 1 against alliance 1 vs alliance 2? also i think alliance 1 vs corp 1 should have signs of being statistically useless, and there's always the petition.if alliance 1 and alliance 2 are rarely online at the same time in mass, how should that resolve? should it just balance out?if alliance 1 successfully blob flipped alliance 2's system, what happens when alliance 1 leaves? what alliance 1 or 2 structures are left standing?if a system is razed and deserted, it should return to sov zero.what if alliance 2 gets alliance 3 to fight alliance 1 and alliance 3 is defeated but there is no game mechanic to associate alliance 3's loss to alliance 2's sov?"
9/6/2011,giving an alliance the ability to online a cynosural jammer might make it easier for smaller alliances to claim space. it could mitigate the threat from getting hot dropped while establishing a foothold.
9/6/2011,"this seems rather interesting.as for the conquering of the system i think it would be best if it was kept per alliance.that means if you have 3 alliances defending a system owned by one of them, and 4 alliances are attacking it, kills or losses by the other 2 defending alliances do not count, also kills by the 4 attacking alliances are counted each for it self.that would mean that alliances that actually bring ships can earn that space, not some filler pets."
9/6/2011,then need mechenics that you need say somting than you will be left treue the gate in 0.0.not suported.
9/6/2011,i agree there needs to be a way to be more secretive about your movements in this game. right now realistically there is no way to sneak up on anyone and it is far too easy to have perfect intel on other people and fleets.
9/6/2011,"i originally thought of this as a response to the mittanis thread about greater null sec independence, where there was a lot of focus about the reliance of null sec on the jita market. but i got thinking and thought it might be pretty cool idea in its own right so to give it a wider viewing i thought id put it up in its own thread to be shot at. the problem appears to be that null sec players are massively reliant on the jita market and there is a perceived logistical nightmare involved in this. a solution would be a trade hub that is smack bang in the middle of 0.0 space. i envision something like mos eisley welcoming to all the worst (best) elements of eve life, a place where the local faction e.g. guristas police the system similar to concord in hi-sec, but where having -10 standing doesnt matter. the system would be entirely isolated from hi and low sec space so that the only route in would be through 0.0 for sub-capitals. i would propose that cynos can be lit just like in normal 0.0 to jump in jfs/carriers etc which would be the main avenue of getting the local market going. a system like this would always be camped to hell so i would suggest that 3 interconnected systems be selected with plenty of gates to the wider 0.0.the systems would be at least further than a single jump for a capital ship, from the nearest low sec and close to the heart of the faction space. one such trade hub for each of the main race factionsis this a good or bad idea? at present i live in a wh and dont pretend to know much about 0.0 mechanics or the wider implications of this idea."
9/6/2011,"there is a trade hub smack in the middle of 0.0. it's called jita.trolls aside, there is no 'middle' of 0.0, being that its a ring around highsec. i believe there are a couple of stations in 0.0 that are open to all (chribba's station comes to mind) but i also think almost no one goes there.if there was a 0.0 station open to all that actually had a hub going, then you'd see campers on the undock 24/7, just like jita except able to bubble the undock and kill everything."
9/6/2011,"quite the opposite. the problem is that it is easier and cheaper to get a couple of jump freighters to jita, buy a large amounts of equipment/ammo, and jump it back out to the alliance hq than to mine and build said equipment/ammo out in 0.0. it doesn't work that way. ccp didn't make any of the current trade hubs we see today... the players did. and they chose it because jita is pretty much the ""center"" of the eve map and [sorta] close to every other high-sec trade hub."
9/6/2011,"risjk vs reward to high for industrilist tho bring eny goods there if sytem get camped, noone wil bring there eny houler or fregts with goods for sell, ther can be done somting about tit to fix this idea. one ting can help you cant atack eny feregt or houler witouty him atacking you first in eny surcenstances he even cant lok them that that can work but now this idea for industrilists ho shuld bring goods doewn there is useles."
9/6/2011,what.
9/6/2011,"a couple points about nullsec trade that you need to be aware of: first, the goal is not to create a new super-hub like jita (even if it is in nullsec). the goal is to move a significant amount of the industry into nullsec, and thereby negate some of the nullsec-jita dependence. the way of life at the moment: abc ores and moon-goo from nullsec are shipped to jita. producers purchase these and build ships/modules, which are then put back on the jita market. then nullsec consumer's purchase the items in jita and ship them back to nullsec. reasons why stuff is not built in nullsec: 1.) most production requires an enormous amounts of low-tier minerals. appropriate quantities of the minerals are typically not available locally. 2.) t2 production requires several types of moongoo, as well as datacores, decryptors, and bpc/bpo's, all of which are typically not available locally. 3.) the number of nullsec production slots is very limited compared to hisec. 4.) there is a lot of extra risk in nullsec. logistics can be intercepted, pos's can be destroyed, outposts can be conquered. 5.) the local demand is often too low to quickly move inventory. in other words, once you build a ship, you want to quickly sell it, or your resources quickly become tied up in inventory. once items are produced in nullsec, local markets will reflect local production. this is in stark contrast to local markets now, which are primarily created by importing jita goods and selling said goods primarily to blues.as such, the most appropriate suggestions focus on providing building materials locally and increasing the production rates and efficiencies so null-sec industry has better returns than hi-sec industry (which is appropriate since null-sec has much more risk!)."
9/6/2011,"it is called vanity for a reason and it is a proven fact that people will fork over serious cash for the smallest increase in prestige (ipod is mediocre mp3 player at best, but sells like caffeine pills at exam time).what ccp needs to do is get more cheap stuff up in the store and get the mingling part of loitering-in-stations released ... nothing more, nothing less."

9/6/2011,"hey, hi, hello. you seem to be one of the disillusioned masses. i think we can both agree that your alliance is afking in your space just as much as anyone else. i don't usually play this game, i just log in hit a single button and inevitably wait for my mom to pull out the plug when she vacuums, but how is being cloaked in your space different then your 12,000 member alliance hiding their ships inside the 12 outposts, and/or the countless poses that you have in cyno-jammed systems? i do remember seeing the words ""invulnerable"" on many of those sov structures. if invulnerability is an exploit, well then i guess your sov structures need to come down. but i think we're really getting to the heart of this problem. you were given all this space but not really told what that meant. so when someone comes in uninvited, you yell to condi for help. but of course, the goons are busy actually being proactive in their space, so they won't come save you from the one cloaked probing alt. perhaps, with time, your keepers can come down and teach you how to hold space. i mean, honestly, fountain is just goon renter space anyway. but i'm happy that you got your name up on the map, i'm sure your internet spaceship friends thing that's really something. that strong rallying cry of ""we're our own person, and don't need mommy condi...for most things.""don't expect to have 6vdt in december. winter is coming."

9/6/2011,"i beg to differ. as far as i've read and heard, the csm is widely regarded as an institution catering mostly, if not entirely, to the whims of the ""big 0.0. alliances"". true or not, i cannot and won't discuss it here, but that seems to be the general perception.take your usual hisec ""carebear"" (and yes, that wording does nothing to counter the aformentioned perception). if he shows some interest in politics (even that alone is a step ahead) he would think that voting for one or another wouldn't change anything for his own lot in eve. so why bother?"
9/6/2011,"some interesting perceptions. what exactly do you think goes on behind the scenes of a csm? do you think there is a bloc of voters who squash down empire or wormhole concerns? you think we act as a type of eve illuminati trying to crush dissent and push an agenda over the screams of those not part of 'the 0.0 bloc' ?sadly this isn't the case, but it would sure be fun!what happens in reality is we all hang out on two persistent skype channels. one with just us, one with a bunch of devs who we get constant communication with. we are constantly discussing issues that are close to us, or issues brought to us by our constituents (my constituents are anybody who emails me with a question/concern btw) and we tend to hit each other up for more information if it's a subject we're not really well read up on. having two step in the group has been a huge boon for example, since most of us don't have a whole lot of experience with wormhole issues and we tend to borrow insight from him a lot. when we want to bring up something informally we can chat directly with the ccp devs who handle that particular area or if we want something more formally discussed we can post threads to direct a topic over a more structured discussion.that's why it's so bizarre when people try to paint insane conspiracies that 0.0 is somehow 'taking over the csm' when all we do is add our voice to the overall discussion which by the way, also includes your voices in the speakers corner and other venues. we are lobbyists, we are advocates, we are a face to face voice to help explain the players complaints or help ccp come to terms with parts of their game that need a lot of work of which they have a blind spot. if you feel your issue isn't being brought up effectively have you taken the time to contact one of the reps to help give it some traction? to date i think i've received maybe 3 evemails along these lines and that's it. if you think that a purely highsec advocate would better represent you then i encourage you to get them out there and start campaigning now so they have the name recognition to get elected."
9/6/2011,"that rather begs the question fun for who? it certainly won't be those people being ignored by the csm. look, we have the words of a number of csm delegates assuring us that they are only interested in supporting the aspirations of those people who voted for them. that's not a conspiracy theory, that's fact. as to the question of a bloc trying to nerf the interests of hisec, i can only speak for myself, but yes, that is exactly the perception that i get.as it happens what you suggest in the latter part of your post is exactly what some of us in hisec are trying to do. not me personally, i have a number of issues that prevent me from standing, i don't think that i have a high enough profile in any case. we are organising a push to make sure that the interests of hisec are adequately adressed. so it's nice to know that hisec has not vanished off of the radar of the csm but i would much rather have candidiates expressly chosen by hisec residents to represent me in the next csm."
9/6/2011,"greetings!i have an idea to make hybrid weapons versatile and somewhat unique. so, since blasters and railguns basicaly work the same way, the difference is blasters extract the plasma from the canister of the ammo while railguns fling the plasma filled canister at the target, they could be merged into one weapon system. hybrid weapons would have two operating modes, short and long range.universal attributes- fitting requirements- energy consumption- overheat- allowed ammunition... mode specific attributes- damage modifier- fire rate- optimal range- falloff range- trackingso what do you think ?"
9/6/2011,"ok, i'll bite. why then should people in hisec not care about what happens there? surely it is in their own interest to make sure that they get the most out of it. if you are saying that because they do not want to be in hisec but feel they have to because of all the perceived disadvantages involved in having a pure 0.0 existence, that they will vote to increase the benefits, facilities and opportunities in nullsec, even if that means nerfing the chances of other people in hisec, whs and so on, two things come to mind: 1) that these actions will have no unintended effects on the balance of the game, debatable in my opinion. 2) that it seems a little like cutting off your nose to spite your face. are people in 0.0 so contemptuous of ""carebears"", jealous or insecure that they need to have everything that the other sections in the game have along with all the benefits that being, supposedly, a pioneer, frontiersman sort of character brings, such as the ability to run capital ships, pos, sovereignty on systems etc. i just do not see why the fact that others choose to play eve as they wish should be a threat. sure, being in hisec is comparatively safe, but as you already have aknowledged it does have its drawbacks and restrictions. rightly so in my opinion, it would not be fair to other areas of the game if it did not, but if players choose to remain in hisec with all its drawback then surely they should take an interest in what happens there and fight hisec's corner if need be."
9/6/2011,if your going to argue this subject...consider the following:1: have you ever mined in a whs system for abc ores?2: ever try to move that **** out by yourself?3: ever do so without any risk invovled? no local means no visual verification your not alone.... 0.0 means all bets are off.if you think its just too easy and it warrants abc ores...then you truely are naive as you are stupid.
9/6/2011,"edit: i've expanded on this quite a bit in a post on page 2. preserving this post just to be sure no ideas are lost.i've been trying to figure out how to make lowsec a more compelling place to be, making it rewarding and productive without removing the risk of getting out of highsec.this idea borrows from the control bunkers of factional warfare. to be clear, this would only affect non-fw systems. the way it works is that a corporation or alliance would ""capture"" a concord outpost. holding this outpost would act as a sort of semi-sovereignty and make members of the corporation concord deputies. any deputies in system would be able to see gcc events on their overview, allowing them to respond to acts of piracy in the same way concord does in highsec. if the person who drew the gcc moves, their beacon moves with them. as always, pods would be exempt from being targets under gcc. also, anyone with a sec status under -5 is fair game to deputies at any time.dispatching gcc'ed pirates in system would net you lps with concord based on their security status. the lower it is, the more lps you get. also, putting a multiplier on existing bounties might make it more attractive. obviously someone could build a -10 character and pop rookie ship after rookie ship to stack up lps. there would have to be something to prevent this sort of farming. ccp knows far better than i do what sort of mechanics they could use to prevent this. if it can't be prevented, another reward system could be used.dealing with abuse of power:deputies violating concord rules by podding gcc offenders or attacking non-gcc or non-outlaw players would need to either be directly attacked by a specially-dispatched concord response, or labelled as outlaws. any corp with outlaw members would have a fixed amount of time to eject those outlaws from membership, or face losing their deputy status.corporations with average security standings below a certain number should not be able to capture outposts. if their status were to drop below that threshold, their deputy status is immediately revoked. they would, however, be able to neutralize an outpost if they were able take control from the occupying deputies.why i came up with this:- lots of people want to play the ""good guys"" in eve, but there aren't many options to do so. it's hard to make the distinction in null and highsec doesn't really allow you to participate in enforcement. - lowsec is boring, this might spice things up a bit by creating larger and more organized battles.- this would make a good mechanic for drawing out people who aren't interested in the current mechanics of faction warfare and nullsec sovereignty. it might even create a pathway into null for alliances who decide they want real sovereignty.- it creates a new way to play in the sandboxideas? suggestions for improvements/clarifications? flames? bring it on :)"

9/6/2011,"to get a serious rebuttal in early:if you ""fix"" afk cloaking, they'll just use a macro to stay cloaked. if you prevent that, they'll make a dozen safe spot bookmarks and run a macro to warp between them 23 hours a day. if you're that afraid of a low-skill alt idling in your system, they will always be able to get you to keep your head down.those of us who have spent a lot of time in wormholes aren't accustomed to the luxury of knowing who is in system, and continue to do our work without that sense of security some people seem to need. and we can carry on for months without being ganked...because we learned to be safe without the crutch of local.no, i'm not advocating for nullsec's local to be removed. i'm fine with it being there. i just want the people who really do seriously whine about afk cloaking to get a reality check and understand how good they have it with their sovereignty and their local channel."

9/7/2011,"intro: as far as i know, the current warp effect is at least 4 years old. i believe it is time for a bit of a visual change in that area.my idea is to replace the current ""get up to speed and slug into warp"" with a more ""punch"" like effect, as demonstrated in the following 4 videos.my first two examples are from the 2009 star trek movie:linkagelinkage - imagine a titan or other capital/supercap class ship performing the 2nd warp.my next examples are from the game mass effect 2:linkage - skip to 2:18linkage - skip to 2:10finally, it seems that ccp has almost pulled this off already in the incursion trailer:linkage - skip to 1:20i appreciate you taking the time to read my proposal.also, keep the suggestions coming, i'd really like to see this become something that (mostly) everyone can agree on and thus get it passed by the csm."

9/7/2011,"the problem is that afk cloakers once there in system are almost impossible to catch unless there idiots no way to scan them down no matter how good your skills, no timer that runs there cloak out, or cloak cool down, its just click and step away and cause annoyance for locals, if it is my system shouldnt my sov have some form of intel upgrade or station ping to uncover said afk cloakers or atleast make it possible with enough skilled pilots."
9/7/2011,"the only thing we really need is a module, missile, or bomb that when cycle releases a tachyon burst that decloaks targets within its area of effect. in games i'm not so big on things that don't have counters, and the cloak currently fits that in eve."
9/7/2011,"pro-tip... it isn't your system.cloakers have counters. they're called ""balls"". be alert, go about your business. bring a friend. use dscan and keep your eys open. want to afk while mining? too effing bad. you're doing it wrong and deserve to get popped.damned whining kids wouldn't last ten minutes in a hole. in my days we didn't even have dscan. you had a buddy sit on the front of your ship with a pair of binoculars and we liked it!"
9/7/2011,"yes yes and ligts a cyno and there 60 recons and sb apears near you :) then wath your 1 bilj ship gos boom and your frend ****** in ass, wil never come again help you :) in this case your tip its junk noting els."

9/8/2011,"synopsis:change jamming mechanics from:z = x/y to:z = 2*x/(2*x+y).x = jamming strengthy = sensor strengthz = jamming chancediscussion:lets skip the deeper questions and implications with regards to jamming and keep this one simple: jamming is supposed to be chance based.however, this is not the case with the current mechanics. once the jamming strength of a jammer becomes greater then the sensor strength of a ship, jamming is no longer chance based, jamming becomes a given. taking into account the bonuses from modules, rigs, skills, ship bonuses, thermodynamics, and gang bonuses especially from the recent move towards posed up t3s, jamming is no longer chance based for the vast majority of ships flown these days.while the existing mechanics worked when jamming strengths of any given module were typically less the half that of the sensor strength of a ship, they break down as the jamming strength approaches and eventually surpasses the sensor strength of a ship. firstly, as the jamming strength approaches the sensor strength of a ship small increases in jamming strength will have a huge reduction in the chance of the target avoiding being jammed. for example a vagabond being jammed by a falcon with an ecm - phased inverter ii that has a jamming strength of 12 has about a 14% chance of not being jammed. if the falcon takes steps to increase the jamming strength of its ecm module to 13, the vagabond now has a 7% chance of not being jammed. so approximately an 8% increase in the jamming strength resulted in a 50% reduction in the chances of a vagabond avoiding being jammed.secondly, as we continue the example above and the falcon takes yet another step to increase the jamming strength of its ecm module to 14, approximately a 7% increase we now find the poor vagabond has 0% chance of not being jammed. unfortunately, jamming strengths of 12, 13 or 14 are not that unreasonable and ultimately a falcon or rook can get nearly a jamming strength of 18 out of its t2 racial ecm modules. that means such a ship would be guaranteed to jam at 100% almost every battlecruiser and below with the exception of some recon, logistics and caldari ships.now if we revisit the examples above with the proposed change we find the following:vagabond = 14 sensor strengthjamming strength of 12; 2*12/(2*12+14) = 63% jamming chance, 37% not jammed jamming strength of 13; 2*13/(2*13+14) = 65% jamming chance, 35% not jammedjamming strength of 14; 2*14/(2*13+14) = 67% jamming chance, 33% not jammedjamming strength of 18; 2*18/(2*18+14) = 72% jamming chance, 28% not jammedas we can see in this revised situation two things happen, the falcon is not longer guaranteed to jam the vagabond every time and as the jamming strength of the falcon's jamming module increases we see a more reasonable corresponding increase it the jamming chances."
9/8/2011,"look at it this way. life insurance pays out for every type of death, except suicide. anytime someone gets concorded, their insurance should be invalidated. also, i think insurance premiums should be adjusted based on sec status. the lower your sec status, the more you pay, the higher your sec status, the less you pay. this means you will have to also take into account how they recover their sec status, as they could just get the status up again before insuring a ship. the lower your sec status, the lower the benefit you get from your ratting. make it take much much longer to get it back to good standing."

9/8/2011,"i'd like to see ccp make the industry index a hidden value. it's already easy enough to disrupt mining ops, broadcasting your mining systems to the universe makes it even easier. soon as you hit industry level 1, it's like blaring, gaudy club music that draws every guido with a cloaky ship to fistpump straight to your mining system and hang out until industry goes back down to 0 or they forget why they came. it's like being the lone hot chick at a nude beach full of frat boys and lecherous old men, and as soon as you doff your top, some guy with a bull horn jumps up behind you and screams tittays tittays tittays!idkwtf this farms and fields idea is, but i think mittani is slightly wrong in stating that ""nullsec is entirely dependent on importing virtually everything from jita, and exports only moon goo."". obviously, we do import nearly everything from high sec, but we do this because it's cheaper. there aren't too many things that high-sec can provide that we can't get out of null-sec (datacores, faction ammo, pos components).the problem is that it makes no sense for us to mine minerals out in null-sec when we can just farm havens and use the bounty isk to buy a significantly larger amount of cheap minerals from high-sec than we could mining it ourselves in null-sec with mountains of reds who want to light us up. the same goes for low-sec.the only real answer i can think of is either increasing the yield that a miner can get from low-end ores in null/low sec or decreasing the mineral yield of high-sec ores and t1 reprocessing. or maybe we could have a new mining ship for your average peon miner (ie, not a cap/command ship) that is only usable in null/low-sec that will mine something like 50% more than a hulk. since we have to spend 50% of our time at a pos because hostiles are goosestepping through our system, i think this is a fair trade.i don't know, i don't really think that dependence on jita is a bad thing - as long as jita is equally as dependent on us."
9/8/2011,posting gm logs is bad mkay. if your issue has not been resolved escalate the petition. or at the very worst case internal affairs.i can guarantee that those broken plexes will not go viral like the nex store did.
9/8/2011,internal affairs?on eve?you kidding right
9/8/2011,"last night on eve radio, myself, trebor and mittens did an interview about what's been going on since the big emergency summit back in june.eve radio show linkageas a result of that, just so it's clear what i think about the current state of eve and where it should be going, i've made a new blog post:reality checkhave a read and i'll keep an eye on this thread and respond as rl allows for the next few days. thank you."
9/8/2011,"ultimately you summed up the state of play today which in reality is no different than it was when this whole incarna fail business started. jester, seems to have captured what the veteran player base new when this whole thing started. its good to see that the csm wants to rattle cages now at least but it is unlikely to achieve anything, you may have had a chance had this process been led by developers, the fact that senior management is leading the charge does not bode well.the ccp business / senior management aspect to this whole affair was the most interesting aspect of the discussion on radio. i can't see how ccp can reverse course if business plans have been made and loans secured on the basis of them, and hence for the dust / wod development to just be dropped in fact ccp may find they have no option but to push harder to get these titles out the door its a bit of a rock and hard place syndrome. still the idiots put themselves in that position, in the first place. its difficult to believe that ccp thought even for an instant that no development on the core aspect of the game that of fis for 2 and half years is / was a good idea just beggars belief.i will say saleene, the csm have done what can be done, we should thank all csm members for that.fly safe,ps am i the only one that keeps getting ""we were ganked"" every time i attempt to visit the new forums?"
9/8/2011,"sorry mate, the csm started out as a gimmick to demonstrate transparency in ccp. t20 did some shady things and the backlash (threadnaught) created the csm as a means to show the player base that ccp has cleaned up it's act and that we as players could go and check up on them to some degree.the csm has evolved into what it is now, but it didn't start out to be what it is."
9/8/2011,"i like it, whatever happened to the new shinys anyway?"
9/8/2011,your avatar is supposed to be wearing them. you didn't get the memo?
9/8/2011,"i could get behind this, that would be pretty awesome."
9/8/2011,"that'd be awesome!also, holy ****, i really need to play mass effect 2 if it's anywhere near as good as those videos suggest."
9/8/2011,"i've been an avid fan of this thread the many revivals and i think the new forums needs a copy of it.been 5 years we just got ""walking in stations"" well sort of but can we get a decent pos now plox."
9/8/2011,confirming that ccp needs to update pos's as one of the priority items. would be cool to get out and walk around in one as well...
9/8/2011,along with this i would also include what changes need to be made to make bounty hunting a viable profession.
9/8/2011,"maybe you could call it ""anti-pirate deputization in losec"" or something better? edited:i mean, something better than ""anti-pirate duputizatin in losec""."
9/8/2011,"as for the subject of this thread, i picked something that would get clicks so people might actually read it :)"
9/8/2011,this is a fantastic idea. +1 from me!
9/8/2011,if count heer was afk after siting in system like 2 weeks witout even not login in dt out seems to me that was bot. that counts as afk if he is 90% afk then on his pc.
9/8/2011,non sarcastic solution: every ship in a system that's isn't using an active module (cloaks don't count towards this)that isn't movingthat isn't chatting on localdissappears from local after 15mproblem solved maybe this is the upcoming changes to local in the works and i'm just profetic. but what about bots used to stay on local used by afk cloakers you ask?well botting is bannable. and if miners can bot then why not afk cloakers. if either gets caught they get banned. oh let's make this only in systems in null sec.
9/8/2011,"people who spend 23 hours cloaked in a system hoping to hotdrop are not making very good use of their time.but like in politics, not every problem needs new legislation. if this does need a fix, the fix is simple, make the cloaking module consume charges. big assed charges like cap boosters.high ho silver! awaaaaaaay!."
9/8/2011,"why shouldn't you be able to afk cloak? usually this is because people want to be able to harvest isk in peace without bad people putting you on edge. you want it safe so you can mine, rat, or run anomalies. you don't want to have to worry about checking your scanner or split your profits by doing these actions in a fleet or mine with protection. if you take even the simplest of precautions you can render afk cloakers completely ineffective, but people just don't want to do that. it's a legit playstyle and already has an effective counter."
9/8/2011,"i can, in all honesty, say that i have no idea what the hell you just said.look, the ""solution"" (like one's actually needed) to afk cloaking is simple. well, the ""solution"" is to be aware etc. however, a change they could make to eliminate the complaints about afk cloaking are simple in concept.1. when you cloak, you disappear from local.2. when you cloak, you also can't use local. your cloak cuts you off in both directions. intel gathering would need to be done actively, with probes, dscan or simply looking around.3. to prevent cyno abuse, when you uncloak put a delay on being able to light a cyno. 15, 30, 60 seconds... something balanced. this would give cloaks more of a true meaning, where you're actually hidden fully. it would also put the intel gathering into ""manual"" mode instead of simply scanning local to see who's there. it would also add to the sport for cloaked hunters... they could be more stealthy in finding and engaging targets. however, it helps the prey by at least removing the threat of an immediate super-drop on their heads."
9/8/2011,"as long as there is stations/pos's there should be also afk cloaking. station and pos owners have advantage over cloakers. actually, i'd say do not allow fitting ships in stations and pos's only capital ships.i think enough said."
9/8/2011,"the only place i see potential for this is null sec. but it needs balance. the balance would be that neither the people holding sov could cloak, nor others in the system. introduce the ""system wide anti-cloaking field"", like the cyno jammer."
9/8/2011,"with my solution, afk cloaker or heck a regular non cloaker going afk disappears off local. false peace of mind for carebears achieved. check. afker moves or uses a module, shows up on local and scares miners away, effective dos attack which cloakers currently enjoy achieved. check. everyone gets what they want. no adverse side effects to other cloaking ships like other suggestions to use cloak fuel seem to ignore."

9/9/2011,ccp give us plex for remap or just more of them!! 1yr is too long..im happy to give you 3 plex for a remap..you will sell alot more remaps than monocles..i want atleast 1 every 6mo..
9/9/2011,m8 that makes so much sense that i have edited my proposal changing the segment from white to the same overview top category. thanks!
9/9/2011,"there's probably good reason most of you havn't suggested this, but i cant help it :dgive em cloaky warp! if i could cloaky warp in a black ops bs, id have one right now!especially if you lowered sensor strength to account for the lawls pwn factor of having a 700 dps redeemer uncloak on you.jst two cents, and their probably not so shiny as some other suggestions.-small fleet pilot, no intentions of ever joining the null blob (cccp please realize just cause they can focus their votes, doesn't mean they vote for us all!)"
9/9/2011,"farewell to the old forums, this being one of the better examples of what this thread is talking about - releasing new shiny junk in the form of the new-patched-upgraded forums that add a bit of functionality but are still far from a decent replacement for these ones for a wide variety of reasons.most annoying part being, user feedback that kept pouring for half a year was almost entirely ignored or not tackled yet.but we're still forced to abandon these forums."
9/9/2011,"the eris is in need of a cpu boost.the enyo is in need of a third midslot, without being able to scram and web a target it is useless.the deimos needs a big power grid boost, a cpu boost, and a 4th mid slot to bring it in line with other races hacs. it should be able to fit neutron blasters as standard, as well as a decent tank so that it can survive long enough to get into range and use them, a mwd, a scram, a web, and a cap booster.the phobos should be given a drone bay size of at least 50m3. the hyperion is rarely used in fleets as the megathron's bonus to tracking are more useful than the hyperions bonus to local repping. i would replace it with a bonus to damage resistance or optimal range.gallente ships in general need to be made faster and have a much higher rate of acceleration, to negate the speed and agility penalties of armor tanking and still get into range of their target, and bring their blasters into the fight.they should also be able to field more drones at a time than any other race, as that is supposed to be their racial speciality. i would suggest a maximum of seven drones for dedicated drone boats, such as the dominix, vexor and ishtar, and six for others such as the deimos, thorax, megathron and hyperion.blasters need a small reduction in powergrid requirements, a small optimal and falloff boost, a big damage boost and a tracking boost. if a blaster boat gets into range of it's target, the blasters should tear the opponent up, not do slightly more dps and then only if they are able to webify the target to keep them still.railguns need a massive boost to alpha damage. currently they're like firing pea shooters, where as they should be like sniper rifles, long range, deadly hard hitting, but with a slow firing rate (which they have) and poor tracking at short range (which they have). there are many reasons not to use hybrid weapons, they use a lot of powergrid and cpu, they only have one damage type (thermal), the ammo takes ages to reload, the weapons use a lot of capacitor power to keep running and they only work at extreme ranges. please balance these out with some reason to want to use them."
9/9/2011,"+1 and supported.""defense contractors in eve""""baby, my love is bomb come on the bomb the twist!"""
9/9/2011,+1 tie the amount of lp gained to the value of the ship destroyed. make a noobship worth 0lp since a noobship is literally worthless.
9/9/2011,"lost my post due to timeout after 2 minutes... god damn you ccp now i have to type again!ok here is my suggestion for such a system: each solar system in lowsec has a police outpost. each player that has a positive security status can come to the outpost, and by providing some pirate tags (or some other token item) become a deputy for 1 hour. multiple people can be deputies in the same system at the same time. becoming a deputy starts a wage counter. if during that one hour noone in the system gets a gcc, or a outlaw does not enter the system, your wage does not change. if someone gets gcc or an outlaw enters the system, you have to respond to the offending pilot in a certain timeframe, based on security status of the system. suggestion: 40 seconds in a 0.4 system up to 3 minutes in a 0.1 system. responding to the offender means doing at least some damage to him. you do not have to kill him. you tried, perhaps he was too strong and you had to go away. caution is the better part of valour in such forsaken solar systems. if you fail to respond, your wage is reduced by the ammount of isk it took to pay the insurance to the pilot that had crime commited on him. not saving a battlecruiser is much worse than not saving a shuttle or frigate. this might completely reduce your wage to 0. tought luck, you are obviously not a good cop. if you destroy the offending pilot, you recive a bonus to wage equal to a fraction of the insurance cost of the agressor ship (50%?). at the end of the hour you are given your wage ammount (can be 0 if you did bad, but not negative). the pay is based on the number of deputies in system. probably best if a system similar to the incursion one is used. so too many deputies or too few of them results in no pay. suggested numbers for 100% wage could be something like 4-10 in 0.4 systems down to 1-4 in 0.1 systems? anything more or less than that results in less wage. what do you think people?"
9/9/2011,"just tweak it a bit to discourage blobbing, like having all the lp divided evenly among the deputy fleet, and i'll fully support more care-bears turned wanna be pvpers in lowsec. please bring as many navy fitted navy ships as your can."
9/9/2011,this looks like something i can support. +1
9/9/2011,"sounds too complicated. i like the method described by the op better. take an outpost, police the local system, lose outpost to either another high-standing corp or for being a griefer. that simple.i also like janos saal's idea of tying the amount of lp given to the class of ship destroyed to mitigate farming."
9/9/2011,"foksieloy wrote:each player that has a positive security status can come to the outpost, and by providing some pirate tags (or some other token item) become a deputy for 1 hour.no. this does nothing to create long-term lowsec occupation or organization. the entire point is to get corps and alliances operating primarily in low, not to get small fleets going out there for one-night adventures.foksieloy wrote: becoming a deputy starts a wage counter. wage? there's never been a wage for any activity in eve. don't start now.foksieloy wrote: if during that one hour noone in the system gets a gcc, or a outlaw does not enter the system, your wage does not change.so you can get paid just by cashing in tags and idling in an empty system.no.foksieloy wrote:responding to the offender means doing at least some damage to him.an outlaw in a covert ops ship would be able to evade you and cost you this ""wage"" just by cloaking up and being in system. outlaws evade highsec navies all the time by being in fast-warping ships. bad idea.foksieloy wrote:the pay is based on the number of deputies in system. probably best if a system similar to the incursion one is used. so too many deputies or too few of them results in no pay. suggested numbers for 100% wage could be something like 4-10 in 0.4 systems down to 1-4 in 0.1 systems? anything more or less than that results in less wage.this means that a gang of 20 people could show up, cash in tags, and just ruin your day by diluting the wage too much.i'm going to reiterate my first line of this post: the idea is to get people to live in lowsec. not go out there for a little fun. people go on lowsec roams now, looking for solo and small gang fights. compared to the pvp you'll find anywhere else, lowsec is a joke right now. i want to fix that by bringing structure and purpose to it."

9/9/2011,"the old philosophical question:if a cloaker is afk in a system, does he still make little children scared?"
9/9/2011,"m8 i not scared i manged to kil some off them with my pvp alt and when they trued to return to systme kiled them again. i jsut wish mechanics that i can kil them noting els. that he cant sit al the time in our sytems and getign intels and sdisturb industrialsit from working, that to easy get in sytems and wait u ntil you have tright moment and strike, that can be days months or weeks need put on them more presure that they to have some limitations."

9/9/2011,"something to keep in mind... they're not your systems. sure, you may have the dominant force in there. you may have sov, upgrades, etc. however, you don't own the system. at best you currently control it. if someone else comes in and decides to afk cloak, tough crap... they have as much right to be in that system as you do. due to numbers, sov etc. you can do more... that's the benefits of having control. however, he's as entitled as anyone else to be there, even if it's cloaked, sometimes afk and sometimes gathering intel.just because you have control in the system don't think you're entitled to fluffy pillows and bunnies in space. you still need the balls to maintain your influence and control. if that one guy cloaked in there somewhere shakes your entire system's operations then perhaps you're not as ready to control it as you think."
9/9/2011,"they do, the cyno jammer, they cant hot drop their caps and super caps in system. of course, you cant bring in reinforcements that way either, but hopefully, if you have a station in system, you have the resources there to defend it as well."
9/9/2011,"cloak self-counters: all you can do while cloaked is observe. dropping cloak to do anything at all makes you detectable.so your problem isn't one person afk cloaking in system, but the sudden appearance of a 60-man blops fleet. when local suddenly spikes up 60 people, it doesn't matter whether they came in via cyno or gate, you do the same thing: get to your pos and keep your head down.there's nothing an afk cloaker can do to you that someone bouncing safe spots or simply logging off in space and coming back later can't do. it sounds to me like you just want to be able to rat and mine risk-free. that's what highsec is for."
9/9/2011,"glad to see your bad spelling is on this forum too.evil: if i were creating the world i wouldn't mess about with butterflies and daffodils. i would have started with lasers, eight o'clock, day one! [zaps one of his minions accidentally, minion screams]"

9/10/2011,this thread needs more zest.
9/10/2011,"i agree with floppiethebanjoclown (looks like crusty the clown has competition) in regards to the post made by foksieloy. not only is it complicated, but such complexity allows for griefing and exploiting.keep it simple.although, i got a question for the op. when you said ""outpost"", to what do you refer to? an npc station or a dead space structure that you stay close to like a pos? frankly, i would prefer the dead space format. after all, if there is ever an aggression, undocking will take too long. a pos-like dead space structure is convenient because then you can quickly warp out in a shorter notice.edit:perhaps a little fleet bonus as well with this kind of feature such as improved align time or improved warp speed (au/sec)."
9/10/2011,"i'm thinking of something resembling a tcu, or the control bunkers of faction warfare (didn't i say that in the op?). in fw, you capture a bunker by putting it into structure; i would treat this the same way, only without the prerequisite dungeons. this would let ccp recycle an existing mechanic, making it familiar to lowsec dwellers and designers alike."

9/10/2011,"i was hoping to make it relatively simple, reusing the control bunker concept and then the overview wouldn't be that different from a cyno field appearing on overview. besides, this is big enough that it would be an expansion in itself, especially if they included their long-promised bounty system fix since it fits with the theme. call it ""enforcement"".here's an idea just to motivate ccp, you could make nex items that would require concord lps as well as aurum. i bet some people would cash in a plex if they could get a concord uniform exclusive to deputies."

9/11/2011,"i'd agree for if the person owns both characters of the name to be changed and pays a fee.so long as:previous name has some kind of fault - clan ticker from previous games, un/intentionally rude, breaks forums, a ccp default name like amarr citizen 2109332.new name has been owned by you for over 3-6 months.apart from that i see no reason why people should be changing names as:it would bring up the subject of removing the names of all the inactive characters.i could bring in the starcraft 2 system when everyone can use the same name but instead have .3231 or a random set of digits after it."

9/11/2011,"ccp has some decent reasons for not allowing name changes, but the benefits to the player community outweigh the concerns.simply listing the name change in the character<U+FFFD>s employment history would solve most concerns; though it would require players to take extra steps to research historical data in some cases (e.g. they would have to search market data for all names a character has held, etc.). ccp could probably develop more comprehensive solutions similar to those listed by the op, but i'm not sure it<U+FFFD>s worth the dev time.in any case, ccp takes an alarmist stance toward name changes, while character transfers are far more problematic. imo a name change should be required when a character is transferred. i don't necessarily want name changes limited to transfers, but they should occur during a transfer at the very least."
9/11/2011,i support way of allowing name change providing provided that the new name could be traced back to old character name
9/11/2011,but... how will i mock corpmates who buy n00bpwnr01 if they can just change the name? do not like.
9/11/2011,"supporting the essential features: akka, searchability, standings, fee, frequency."
9/11/2011,"i support the ability to change a character's name, i do have some issues with some of the options you listed in your post.however, ccp should determine the functionality of changing character names.for all those who would argue that they can't track someone because of corp theft or whatever, do you realize how easy it is to create an alt on an existing account? yes, you can require an api key. or create a trial account and just start a new character? doesn't take any skillpoints to be a corp thief. i can buy another character just as easy. so it seems like both of these are much easier ways to get around 'player identity' than changing the character's name.this seems like the perfect opportunity for an infusion of money to ccp, just like the now outdated money a picture change, i would pay to change my name.as another suggestion, you could create a new forum and require people to post there."
9/11/2011,yep agreeing with this man's comment.
9/11/2011,"consider the debated feature: ""character transfer <U+FFFD> name changes should not transfer in the event of a character transfer (reverting to the first name while preserving full name history) and/or no character having been transferred will ever be allowed a name change. this is highly divisive, but it keeps the character market level."" i believe this satisfies your issue"
9/11/2011,"please do! i'm assuing you had issue with the deabated features section -- which is great because there is some really reactioanary stuff in there. for clarities sake i added a statement following the title, hopefully that gets my point accross.as for your suggestion -- could you clarify? i'm envisioning a forum topic where, kinda like a newspaper, it would have postings of recently changed names. assuing i got it right it sounds worthy of being added to the debated feature section."

9/12/2011,"(original thread)with the incarna expansion, the original 'basic training' tutorial known as 'crash course' was updated and changed into - aura npe (new player experience) tutorial part 1, tutorial part 2, tutorial part 3, tutorial part 4.along with that change, 60 different event agents (15 per faction) known as tutorial agents were forced into early retirement due to aura npe who has single handedly ended 'the endless battle' mission.'the endless battle'(2-part mission)this used to be the new players very first 'real' mission which could only be completed once per agent in the life of the character. part 1 was a simple encounter mission against a single npc which when destroyed, would drop a small specific item to be returned to agent. part 2 was a simple courier mission to transport a small specific item to a nearby solar system.a small amount of corporation and faction standing incurred for completing that. the agent would then refer players to 1 of 60 (15 per faction) career agents for more advanced training on the various careers available.basically, the incorrectly named 'tutorial agents' didn't give any instruction or information to new players other than refer them to the career agents. the old 'tutorial agents' were actually political liaisons for their specific faction. those 60 agents were a good source for gaining a 1 time faction standing increase.i propose 2 different options for the 60 tutorial agents (15 per faction) and their mission 'the endless battle', 1 simple and 1 complex.option 1 (simple):bring the old 'tutorial agents' back out of retirement and change their title to 'political agents'. have them continue offering 'the endless battle' mission with a slight change to their ending dialog so they don't refer players to the career agents (currently done by aura npe).option 2 (complex):have the new 'political agents' (15 per faction) split up into 5 different agent levels, 3 agents per level from level 1 to level 5. have them all offer 'the endless battle' mission series but have the mission difficultly and reward increased to match the higher agent levels.these new 'political agents' and their mission offers can only be completed once per agent in the life of the player's character, just like the old 'tutorial agents'.the code is already written and with some slight programming, option 1 could be implemented very easily. option 2 would of course take a little more time and work to implement but is still doable.thank you all for taking the time to read this proposal.dmc"

9/12/2011,"i don't think there is anything wrong with an alias change feature. have an alias tab appear next to employment if you changed to a new alias. the only thing is you only get to once and have to wait a period of time before another edit, kind of like how you have to wait a period of time after to revamping your attributes. the old link to your character name will redirect to your new one.this isn't going to change your standings or employment. what's the point of making a stupid name paying isk/aur for it? i see no problem, can be done since ccp edits names/birth history fields with their tools."
9/12/2011,"with searchability on old name there is no reason why this would happen. the very, very slight increase in ability to dodge reputation is completely negligible compared to all the gazillion ways already available. if people would actually have reasons against allowing it i could maybe be persuaded they are right, but the only ones disagreeing either have reasons that dont make any sense (like this one), or dont even bother with posting a reason."

9/13/2011,"fail. name is a word. it's a handle. it's just a part (a social pointer if you will) of what character is. changing name does not change who character is. changing name does not suddenly point to some other character.but if suddenly someone else possess character, they become someone else, and all the reputation will mean nothing because they start acting differently. so, name stays same, but everything else is not same. it's exactly what already exists in game: character transfers.bashing down proposal (name change) on basis that it goes against game's principle (reputation matters), while said proposal does everything to uphold the principle (akka, searchable history, standings permanence) and having functional game mechanic (character transfers) that breaks said principle is poor form."
9/13/2011,"not fail.... a name is the character.if i am in a system and a name i recognize comes into the system, its linked to my memories of that character and what reputation that person has with me.if i have a name of someone who keeps trying to kill me on a post-it on my moniter, i can 'bug-out' if i see them.allowing namechanges will remove that recognition from the game!and dont suggest list of aliases in character sheet. i can't look up every person i want to look out for, every day just in case they have namechanged.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
9/13/2011,"how do you know character wasn't transferred? or even, how would you know character was transferred (as any available record can be faked)? so, instead of depending on name recognition, that doesn't work (as you can't be sure that character is played by the same player), why not depending on game mechanics (standings) and/or improved awareness and tactics on your part to make yourself safer?op proposal includes fee (cost) and frequency (cooldown between name changes). so, you could still depend on name recognition, just with a twist now and then, which can be reduced in effect through standings."

9/13/2011,"maybe so for you, but i can tell you for a fact smaller corporations do check for background based on names, that's how it is.also, that still doesn't address the issue i pointed out. if i travel in lowsec, there's blokes i know are permacamping gates with sbing rokhs, why should they get a free pass at a new name?also some people are known cyno scout alts, i know from looking at them who they are without having to do some digging through history and former names and transfers and whatnot.the inconvenience to the many does not warrant the convenience to the few in this case. you have a name, live with it.still nope from me."
9/13/2011,"please, elaborate. i don't see how doing background checks based on name is bad.do you know everyone in eve? not likely, but if you do, name changes won't affect you, as you know everyone anyway. if you don't, you are already checking on people you don't know. old players stop playing, new players start playing. eve's not frozen in time. also, it's not like suddenly everyone you know will change their name simultaneously, and keep changing just in spite.cyno alts are cheap. they can be trained much faster than proposed name change frequency period."
9/13/2011,"fw plexing can be the best way to get small scale pvp in the game. it can i believe be the absolute best thing this game has to offer.1) let players know when occupancy plexes are entered! so they know where to find pvp and plexes can't be won by hiding from pvp.this could easilly be done by 2 dedicated channels. one for the gallente caldari front the other for the minmatar amarr front. this channel would just say ""cearain minor auga destroyer"" if i entered a minor plex in auga in a destroyer. it would be nice if players could then ""set destination"" for auga right from the message. no players would be able to post in these channels to screw them up.2) remove the npcs from plexes. pve and pvp don't mix well, i won't go through all the reasons for this now, but its true. (if this is too much for for ccp or players i would be fine if the rats spawned as described in post 14 below.) the idea is npcs should not be detering pvp like they do now. here is the old thread that goes into this more in depth."
9/13/2011,"supported, though not with your specific requests. i think they should be bs-sized recons.the cloaked velocity multiplier is dope. it lets you full-speed align while cloaked. only a covert cloak would be better. too bad about the scan res gimp from the non-covert cloaks. as it is, you have to fit a sensor booster with a scan res script just to get a very slight improvement to scan res. if you want more range, well... fit another one? lol, no.the jump(portal) range is decent. it's only a battleship. it should be able to jump the same distance as a supercarrier. for the same reason, annother increase in fuel bay size is asking a lot. an alternative would be to fix jump portal skill skill so that it also applies its bonus to lo consumption, instead of just stront for titan bridges. then you might have a reason to train that skill higher.or jsut give them a consumption reduction bonus.t2 resists would be nice. especially for the widow. it definitely could use more tank since it's an ecm boat.many folks have proposed giving black ops a covert cloak. that would put it more in line with its counterparts and resolve some of the more bitter issues. honestly, i think we can afford to make it a bit opf a solo pwn mobile. the force recons have crap dps. the bombers have no tank. covert ops... battle buzzard ftw? it does get a dps bonus, has 5 mids, and moves like greased lightning.

9/13/2011,"tl;dr: give remote assistance modules an aggression timer equal to that of the target they're assisting, rather than a fresh timer. this eliminates rr-docking game abuses, without removing the ability of a logi gang to withdraw from a fight by non-aggression.presently, logistics ships can assist combat ships without being hit with a combat aggression timer. this allows them to repair gang mates without losing the ability to dock or jump. lots of pilots have taken issue with this, and for good reason. the most common solution to this is giving remote assistance modules an aggression timer when they help aggressed pilots. unfortunately, this medicine is worse than the disease it's trying to cure.a gang must be able to withdraw from a fight. presently, if a battleship shoots something, they can cease fire and still run their local tank modules while they wait out their aggression. they can shoot something and receive remote reps while they wait out their aggression. and when the timer is done, the gang (logistics included) can safely dock or use the jump gate. the important part here is that you can still tank while the timers tick down -- you just can't undertake offensive action. now suppose that remote assistance incurred an aggression timer in the normal sense. the logistics pilot would receive an aggression timer for repping an aggressed pilot. this timer would quickly spread to the entire logistics chain via their capacitor transfer modules. if these incurred aggression in the normal sense, then these timers would be continually refreshed and the gang would not be able to withdraw without stopping their tanks for a full 60 seconds. i shouldn't have to explain why that isn't a survivable option.suppose, on the other hand, that remote assistance didn't give you a fresh timer, but rather gave you a timer equal to that of the pilot you're assisting. that is, repping a pilot that hasn't shot anyone for 10 seconds would give you a 50 second timer. this timer would still spread among the logistics gang -- but it wouldn't be refreshed every time a module cycled.if the timers worked as i described, where you inherited the target's timer, the logistics gang would be able to dock or jump out at precisely 60 seconds from their gang's last combat action -- which prevents logistics pilots from being able to dock up immediately, as described, but also allows the gang as a whole to cease offensive action and still withdraw effectively.please make remote assistance modules incur a combat aggression timer equal to the the remaining time on the pilot they're assisting."

9/13/2011,"perhaps you could add pod killing being allowed for people with bounties, this would make bounty hunting a viable option as well...?"
9/13/2011,"if i were designing this as an expansion, a legitimate bounty hunter occupation would be part of the package. the idea would be to build it around the theme of law enforcement via pvp action.i'd like to see bounty contracts where you could issue a permanent contract to pay isk for the frozen corpse of a particular player, regardless of their sec status. this would mean that a corp or alliance could create internal contracts, basically rewards for podding specific enemies. public contracts would be possible as well. it would be nice if the system could combine multiple contracts so that one corpse completed them all, but if you had to choose who you gave the corpse to, that would be fine too.i think you should have to register with concord as a bounty hunter and declare particular targets at the bounty office. concord should only approve targets with criminal histories to be podded in highsec; if their sec status is above 0 and they've never incurred a gcc, then you would have to suicide to get their pod and collect a bounty. this would prevent abuse of the system for the purpose of griefing by getting permission to pod anyone you put a bounty on."
9/13/2011,"eve: enforcementan overview of an idea for a major expansion to the eve universedeputizing lowsecthis idea began as an effort to reinvigorate those areas of lowsec not presently used for faction warfare. at the same time, it was intended to give those players who want to be ""the good guys"" a way to participate in pvp with a feeling of purpose.the core of the idea is this: concord has taken an interest in expanding their enforcement into lowsec. out of necessity they will steer clear of the established battlegrounds of the faction wars. the problem is, they don't have the manpower to provide the 24/7 enforcement that would represent a true increase in the security level of a system. instead, they have opted to involve capsuleers in the project.to this end, concord places a concord relay station in each non-fw lowsec system. a crs would behave similar to the control bunkers in faction warfare, in that they would be captured by a corporation or alliance by putting them into structure. if you need a reason for concord wanting you to shoot their structure to capture it, let's just say they want to verify you can field and organize sufficient firepower to actually do the job. a corp or alliance that holds a crs would then become concord deputies.any deputies in a system they control would see gcc alerts on screen and on their overview. this would be similar to the way a cyno field alert occurs. so long as the gcc timer is active on a player and they are in system, a warp-to beacon would follow them. gcc timers in a deputy-controlled system would prevent you from docking at stations--unless you were in a pod--but you would be able to jump out of system according to normal gate mechanics. it would be possible to outrun depties for 15 minutes by continuously warping between celestials.rules of engagement: deputies can only fire on known pirates (people with -5 or lower) and anyone with gcc timers. pods would be exempt from gcc, but a -5 security status would invalidate this protection and allow deputies to pod you on sight.any deputies violating the rules of engagement will be attacked by a special concord fleet dispatched to deal with corrupt deputies. abuse of power will not be tolerated. corporate ceos would be informed via notification of any such action, and warned that repeated actions by the same member would cause the corp to lose its deputy status. three offenses by a single deputy would cause the corp to lose all deputy status.any player who has triggered such a loss of status will be permanently flagged an outlaw deputy by concord, making it easy for deputy corps to avoid recruiting known violators. corporations employing outlaw deputies would not be able to captures a crs, only neutralize it. this mechanic would be designed to minimize griefing.entities with an average security status below -1 would not be able to capture a crs. if they hold one and their average status drops below -1, they lose their deputy status and the crs goes neutral. a negative-status corp will be able to attack the crs and put it back to neutral by putting it into structure.bounty huntingin keeping with the theme of law enforcement and being the good guys, it's time to address the inadequate bounty system.first, to address the current issues: - bounty can only be applied to people with negative security standings. this means anyone willing to do a little ratting to bring their standings up gets a free pass on piracy.- bounties are tied to the character, meaning anyone can collect them. got a 5 billion isk bounty? get a friend to pod you and split the cash. better yet, make an alt and pod yourself.i propose two major changes to fix this.first, create bounty contracts. remove the silly two-week limit to contracts so that bounties can be placed indefinitely (or at least for 3-6 months). contracts can be to specific individuals, internal to corporations, or public...this means that bounties can be restricted to just the people you want. remove the security status limitation so that bounties can be placed on anyone, allowing a corp at war to designate high-priority targets internally and attach rewards for killing them. make the frozen corpse a condition of completing the bounty.second, making bounty hunting a legal occupation in highsec. as bounty contracts are not something you accept until you can deliver the goods (corpse), you would go to a concord bounty office, pay a fee to declare a target which has an active bounty contract, and then be free to pursue and pod them anywhere.idea: concord locator agents available only to registered bounty hunters who have active targets? just a thought.in order to protect people from being griefed by constant bounties being placed on their heads, only known criminals (people who have triggered a gcc) would be valid bounty targets in highsec. it would still be possible to wardec their corp or suicide gank them to get their pod.incarna stuffwe might as well accept that incarna is here to stay and incorporate it into our ideas for improvements to the game. vanity items available exclusive to deputies and bounty hunters might actually generate some mt activity and give players something that's worth showing off.this would be a good way to test profession-related info screens; it would be kind of cool if your cq had a screen that showed recent gcc activity in a deputized system or bounty hunters could see relevant information.black ops and assault frigatesthis is a bit of a side bonus which i think we could tie in to the theme by saying these ships need updating to support the lowsec operations and bounty hunting profession. i won't go into greater detail on this here as there are literally years of discussion and debate on how best to fix/improve these"

9/13/2011,"synopsis:change jamming mechanics from:z = x/y to:z = 2*x/(2*x+y).x = jamming strengthy = sensor strengthz = jamming chancediscussion:lets skip the deeper questions and implications with regards to jamming and keep this one simple: jamming is supposed to be chance based.however, this is not the case with the current mechanics. once the jamming strength of a jammer becomes greater then the sensor strength of a ship, jamming is no longer chance based, jamming becomes a given. taking into account the bonuses from modules, rigs, skills, ship bonuses, thermodynamics, implants, and gang bonuses especially from the recent move towards posed up t3s, jamming is no longer chance based for the vast majority of ships flown these days.while the existing mechanics worked when jamming strengths of any given module were typically less the half that of the sensor strength of a ship, they break down as the jamming strength approaches and eventually surpasses the sensor strength of a ship. firstly, as the jamming strength approaches the sensor strength of a ship small increases in jamming strength will have a huge reduction in the chance of the target avoiding being jammed. for example a vagabond being jammed by a falcon with an ecm - phased inverter ii that has a jamming strength of 12 has about a 14% chance of not being jammed. if the falcon takes steps to increase the jamming strength of its ecm module to 13, the vagabond now has a 7% chance of not being jammed. so approximately an 8% increase in the jamming strength resulted in a 50% reduction in the chances of a vagabond avoiding being jammed.secondly, as we continue the example above and the falcon takes yet another step to increase the jamming strength of its ecm module to 14, approximately a 7% increase we now find the poor vagabond has 0% chance of not being jammed. unfortunately, jamming strengths of 12, 13 or 14 are not that unreasonable and ultimately a falcon or rook can get nearly a jamming strength of 18 out of its t2 racial ecm modules. that means such a ship would be guaranteed to jam at 100% almost every battlecruiser and below with the exception of some recon, logistics and caldari ships.now if we revisit the examples above with the proposed change we find the following:vagabond = 14 sensor strengthjamming strength of 12; 2*12/(2*12+14) = 63% jamming chance, 37% not jammed jamming strength of 13; 2*13/(2*13+14) = 65% jamming chance, 35% not jammedjamming strength of 14; 2*14/(2*13+14) = 67% jamming chance, 33% not jammedjamming strength of 18; 2*18/(2*18+14) = 72% jamming chance, 28% not jammedas we can see in this revised situation two things happen, the falcon is no longer guaranteed to jam the vagabond every time and as the jamming strength of the falcon's jamming module increases we see a more reasonable corresponding increase it the jamming chances."

9/14/2011,"gang links should only apply to the grid where they are active. off-grid gang links these days are pretty popular with ""solo"" players and small groups that operate in a single solar system. i believe that if a pilot and ship are affecting your on-grid combat, they should be on-grid with you so that there is a chance to eliminate the force multiplier. this is already the case with every other ship and module that affects combat unless you count assigned fighters -- and in that case you can destroy the fighters to eliminate their effect.i have no problem with gang links in general as i've been the beneficiary probably more often than the victim, but someone ought to be at the helm and the ship ought to be vulnerable to counterattack.likely the main detractors will say that since a gang linked ship has to be uncloaked to provide bonuses it is vulnerable -- but this isn't true if the ship is at a pos."
9/14/2011,i agree with this. another role where you can be completely immune in pvp combat and yet still effect the outcome of a battle. not really a good thing.

9/14/2011,"why? the current system is limited to the solar system the booster is in, i don't see why it couldn't be reduced further to only be for those ships it can see on grid."
9/14/2011,"your proposal is based on a false premise. namely that off grid ganglinks are immune to attack. back when it was possible to make a ship unprobable, it was broken as they had no risk beyond spies in fleet. now however, they can be probed just like everything else. there is nothing stopping you from probing and killing them other than your own ineptitude. some people do put them inside pos's and although that blocks attacking the booster ship, you can always go kill the pos instead. it probably costs more anyways tbh."
9/14/2011,"i appreciate that comment, but i think we should leave it to ccp to decide what is difficult because they're the guys writing the code. if they say it's impossible or would take months of work for a potentially small benefit, then i'm content to let them work on something else."

9/14/2011,"+1 for addressing neutral rr.""baby, my love is bomb come on the bomb the twist!"""
9/14/2011,"technically, this isn't so much a way of addressing neutral-rr as it's addressing rr in general. an in-corporation logistics pilot can exploit the current instant-dock mechanics just as easily as an out-of-corp pilot can. this is really more about fixing docking games, in which logistics pilots can dock up at any time without suffering from the 60-second combat aggression timer.if you're concerned about wardecs and out-of-corporation logistics moving about freely until they get to combat, then that will need an entirely different proposal, such as lengthening the war-declaration assistance aggression timer. if this is a concern to you, you should probably open a separate proposal.if they appropriately address the combat aggression timer, i don't think it would be particularly necessary. people seem to confuse the two issues, but they really are two very separate issues regarding how remote assistance interacts with aggression timers. i'd suggest trying this first and seeing if the whining about neutral-rr is really more just about docking games in general. small changes first, you know? that said, i wouldn't oppose such a proposal so long as it didn't negatively affect low/null-sec logistics.edit: here's a guideline for differentiating the two problems. if it affects pilots in low/null-security space, it's not a ""neutral-rr"" problem. it's the combat-aggression remote-assistance problem i've described in this thread. if it's an issue relevant only to wardecs and canflipping, then you've got a neutral-rr problem."
9/14/2011,this would be pretty good.
9/14/2011,1
9/14/2011,"i like the level of detail you went into. very well thought out. although, i can imagine how complicated it will be for ccp to implement this idea since they're way too busy with incarna.here is a question though, if a capsuleer were to initiate the gcc, how long do you propose for the flag to remain in their record before it is no longer on their record (thus rendering them as inactive pirates)? personally, i would say an entire month (which i think is about the same duration as a kill right)."
9/14/2011,"good point. the short answer is, i'm not sure. the first gcc event shouldn't last longer than a month, but if you keep getting more, it should definitely have a cumulative effect to the point that you are permanently branded a criminal and are always at risk of being hunted."
9/14/2011,"op has a couple of interesting ideas, one significant misconception about current criminal/outlaw mechanics, and one mind-bogglingly stupid suggestion that would make a lot of piracy essentially untenable by eliminating the ability to use safespots.specifically, the clause about ""anyone with a sec status under -5 [being] fair game to deputies at any time"" is completely redundant - it's already the case that if your sec status is below -5, anyone can shoot you at any time without taking gcc or sentry aggro. while not in and of itself damning, the fact that the op felt the need to include it strongly suggests that he doesn't really know what he's talking about or what lowsec is currently like.second, the idea of a beacon for a gcc event is kind of interesting (although also pretty redundant in a lot of cases, since non-terrible players can use the d-scanner to quickly find out where things are happening in system). however, the idea of a warpable marker that follows you wherever you go while gcc'd would instantly kill any form of solo roaming piracy because the ability to warp to a safe/disengage after snacking on some hostile gang's bait or otherwise picking off a few of their members is fundamental to roaming pvp in general."
9/14/2011,"the beacon would only be visible to ""deputies"" ... not the other roaming gangs, right?"
9/14/2011,"you're wrong about that. currently i can go out to lowsec and pop and pod anyone i want if i'm willing to endure the loss of sec status, and maybe tank some sentry guns. i set up a scenario in which deputies are held to a higher standard, in that they can't do that without provoking serious consequences. then i added the exception that a sec status below -5 would allow them to carry out such an act without those consequences.yes it's a bit redundant on normal rules of engagement, but i felt the need to spell it out as i was rewriting those rules a bit for the ""good guys"" who would be taking on this role. ^^^^ this. also, i have already said in this thread it would be possible to outrun a deputy response by warping between safe points and celestials or even fleeing to a neutral system to wait out your gcc. it wouldn't negate the ability to run to a safe spot to avoid retaliation, it would just make criminals run from concord, not just warp off and idle.some stuff that was brought up by a corpmate:there needs to be a way to abandon a crs, or avoid capturing it if you don't want to be a deputy but don't have sufficiently low sec status.people with sec status below -5 should get their own nex goodies. eyepatches, anyone?non-deputized systems should have penalties that make things a bit easier for pirates...extra incentive for neutralizing the concord station:- stations have reduced docking radius and become kickout stations- sentries have lower sensor strength and do less damage (or maybe have lower rate of fire)- the question was raised whether drop rates could be adjusted to give pirates better drops in neutral systemsassign static bounties on each class of ship, and modify it based on the pilot's security status. this bounty would be specific to deputies. it should never be more than the difference between the price of a ship and its platinum insurance value...this would avoid people making money by popping -10 alts in cruisers."
9/14/2011,that's an interesting idea and need more talkthe future system for boosters and capsuleers law may be close enough to use part of the code for this idea
9/14/2011,"i like the general idea, but have several comments and suggestions: 1.) stick to one subject in this post. fixing bounty hunting, assault frigates, and adding incarna bling is not really relevant. these ideas will only sidetrack this topic and smother your main idea. 2.) i think your scope is too small. controlling/patrolling one system is a little too limited and boring. do you lose sight of a criminal once they switch systems? for better results, have bunkers provide constellation-wide benefits (at least). perhaps expanding it to region-wide with multiple deputy corps, thereby allowing multiple (but limited) alliances to patrol a single region. if a corp feels they control a constellation, they are more likely to patrol the borders and hunt enemies within. multiple alliances increase opportunities for anti-pirate activity across multiple timezones. 3.) i really like the warpable beacon that follows the gcc'd player for the duration of their gcc. ideally, it should only be visible to concord deputies; otherwise there isn't much of a reason to be a deputy, as anyone can shoot a gcc player and they don't have to deal with stringent guidelines. note: this is best left as a double edged sword... warping to their beacon might land you on an unprepared pirate, or it might land you next to their deathstar pos. this could also make deputized players very useful to low-sec fleet battles, as they can always provide a warp in to the gcc flagged... 4.) it should be possible to identify the concord deputies in local, just likes it<U+FFFD>s possible to identify pirates and war targets. 5.) gcc's do not prevent a person from docking or jumping. all acts of aggression carry a 1 minute aggro timer that prevents docking and jumping. if you use the transferable gcc to prevent docking and jumping (not sure you can separate these two), you will alter a lot of rr activities in low-sec. considering that most low-sec pos bashes generate gcc's for the parties involved, the implications of preventing a gcc'd player from docking are too far-wielding to support without serious further investigation. 6.) assuming you do agree with a multi-system patrol, having a concord chat window that updates with the name of a gcc'd player and the system they received that gcc (within your patrol area) would go a long way to enable pirate hunting. remember, every time a station/gate gun fires on a gcc'd player, their gcc is reissued, and an update would be provided. at first, i thought this would be too much anti-pirate info, but it could easily be used to divert attention away from some pirate strike, or perhaps even lure some deputies into a trap. 7.) i think increasing the sec status penalties for deputies is the best option to ""deal"" with deputies that violate the rules. if they have a +5 sec status and they pod a guy, so what.... just have them take a bigger hit than a normal player. 8.) concord bunkers: how can an existing concord deputized alliance prevent another wanna-be-deputized alliance from shooting their control bunker to negate their deputy status? since both have high standings, attacking each other would generate a gcc? how does an existing concord deputized alliance forfeit their deputation? i think you need a better method of deputizing alliances. be wary though, as you want only a limited number of deputies/area, becoming a deputy should be moderately challenging, maintaining deputy status should require sustained actiivty, and deputy status needs to be removeable.... somehow.... this is non-trivial! 9.) why are the faction warfare zones excluded?"
9/14/2011,ignore this post.
9/14/2011,"the af/black ops fixes i threw in because i want to see them happen, and they would help flesh out an expansion (which is the only way this could ever come about). the incarna stuff is there mostly to satisfy ccp's desire to have more incarna stuff.i feel like the bounty fix fits perfectly in this idea. it's sort of a natural expansion on the whole ""law enforcement"" idea that is the core of the proposal. the story would center around concord's increasing efforts to make space safer, not just around this idea for lowsec.incarna rolled out in a few stages. there's no reason not to do the same with an expansion like what i describe here. a sufficiently large organization could easily take control of an entire constellation. this system allows a small-ish corp to take a single system and a large alliance to take over enforcement in significant portions of lowsec. it's similar to sovereignty: just because you can have just one system doesn't mean you're limited to one. i must not have been as clear in my wording as i thought. yes, the gcc beacon would only be available to deputies. agreed. a special tag would denote deputies. agreed. i forget how screwy the rr situation can be sometimes. it would definitely need serious consideration...i just don't want the criminal to be able to warp a couple of times and then dock up to escape deputies. you would really just need to differentiate between those doing damage and those supporting them...allow the rr to dock up/jump as normal while making it harder on the ""real"" criminal....just an idea."
9/14/2011,"this is exactly the sort of gameplay i want to encourage with a system like what i propose. fair enough. i agree it certainly leaves some questions open. to an extent, i feel like some of this design would have to be done by ccp: they know what their vision for eve is, they know exactly what kind of mechanics they can and will produce, and frankly it's their jobs :) i *thought* somewhere in here i addressed some of that. i'll check back.edit: i'm no expert on faction warfare, but it's my understanding a corporation involved in fw can withdraw at any time. dropping deputy status would work the same way. i feel like maybe there's a small hole here somewhere that i need to fill in on how a corp/alliance takes up deputy status and how to make it all work well.tangential thought: there needs to be something to encourage cooperation between deputy corps so they don't bicker over territory and that sort of thing.as for taking control from other deputies: i *think* i said somewhere in here that attacking the crs would not incur a gcc, and from there it would be like if someone can flipped you: if they're shooting your crs you can shoot them, but they can't shoot you until you shoot them. sounds like i need to go back through the thread and pull my ideas together a bit more. i'm already over 6,000 characters on my write-up on this idea now.i agree that holding status should require a level of activity. there would have to be some way of monitoring levels of patrols and enforcement, similar to sov levels i suppose.for the roleplaying aspect, because concord is deliberately staying out of the empire wars. they have no interest in attempting to enforce law in a war zone, for obvious reasons. it would be left to the local militias to patrol systems in which they've gained control.i thought the presence of the concord bunkers and the activities relating to that would detract from the faction wars. also, the inability to take out a neutral scout without risking the faction militia getting access to a gcc beacon on you for the next 15 minutes would be a bit too much. the two systems need to be exclusive so they don't interfere with one another."

9/14/2011,"damn something must be wrong with the universe as i'm actually agreeing with the goon. what he said with bells on, there's nothing wrong with cloaking, what you fail to realise there is no difference between afk cloaking or active cloaking, you don't if they are active or not active so what is the difference, the threat is the same. it seems like people just want to rat/mine in peace in an area that is not designed to be peaceful at all."
9/14/2011,"there is a problem if someone afk cloaks in a complex or whatever so it cannot despawn till downtime, that is a pathetic thing to do.there is currently no way of finding them as they could be anywhere."
9/14/2011,find another plex? another system.....yes i do agree it's pathetic but it's easy enough to find something else to do. you're basically moaning you cannot farm plexs with a afk cloaker?find a better system with more plex's in it i think the lastest patch you get 3/4/ sanctums and 6-7 havens in a -0.8 system now? you're getting one afk cloaker in your system he can only screw up one site.
9/14/2011,"which is a 'general' rule (note the quotes) that is superceded countless times by ccp and csm stating that cloaking is working as designed.cloakers can and are allowed to do those things risk free.the only issue here is that it afkers keep system citizens on edge without any effort, so the local chat timeout when not active solves everything, while maintaining the intended usage of cloak as a espionage and psyop weapon (when the user is active)"
9/14/2011,"i think you're kind of on the right track, however why should a cloaked vessel show up on local at all? it seems the device that's cutting off your ship from the entire em spectrum (for detection purposes) should do so immediately, as well as cut off you're access to those communications systems. when you cloak, you leave local. you cannot bee seen in local, nor can you see local (i.e. no free intel while cloaked, requiring the cloaked vessel to actively gather intel). also, to prevent the surprise cyno, have a delay before you can activate a cyno (say 30 secs) when you uncloak."
9/14/2011,sounds fun!
9/14/2011,"leave cloaking as it iswhats the problem with ppl being cloaked and afki live in wh space, if ppl are stupid enough to be cloaked afk, then they run the risk of missing chars jumping into thier system and cloaking up, which is good if you are on the hunt , and if they are stupid enough to be cloaked up in a wh that isn't thiers, then they run the risk of getting trapped in a system due to the wh closing naturally or being closed by the residentsseems to me its the nullbears crying over this issue when they have local anyway"

9/14/2011,"never really flown a jamming ship before, but you seem to have thought this out fairly well.i agree that the proportion to jamming strength increase vs chance of not being jammed is flawed. i also agree that there should always be some chance to it, but the proposed change seems like it cuts it back a little too far. maybe get it to where a fully decked out falcon can jam 90% of the time and it'll be golden. =)either way, until someone shows evidence to the contrary, i think it's a good idea. *like*"

9/15/2011,"this. ccp keeps removing good stuff, they need to start putting some back in, and this is they type of place to start. why make so much of there previous work obsolete needlessly?"
9/15/2011,"actually, i haven't based my proposal on that premise at all. i've based the proposal on the premise that off-grid assets shouldn't influence on-grid fights. anything that influences a fight on a grid should be on that grid.and honestly, ""you can go kill the pos"" is a kind of silly response as you can't just go shoot the pos and stop the ship with links -- you would have to go through the whole process of reinforcing it, then coming back later to finish it off. you've not stopped what i consider to be the problem, you've merely prevented it from happening in the future.i expect the likely outcome would be that people would still use gang links this way, but that they'd be out at 300 km from whatever fight they are influencing. but at least you'd know that your fight was being directly impacted by links."
9/15/2011,i agree as well with the idea of limiting the range of gang links. especially in respect to mining. i've been in 0.0 before and i have seen plenty of players park their rorqual/orca alts in the safety of a pos while other mine (reaping the bonuses). not much risk there compared to the rewards of mining.
9/15/2011,what rewards?
9/15/2011,"fleet fights would always start with ""primary the claymore/vulture/damnation"" and the whole point of fleet bonuses would vanish into thin air(fleet fights usually have command ships on grid though v0v) ""it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths."" - abrazzar"
9/15/2011,"but i do believe that fleet boosters should not be in npc corps ""it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths."" - abrazzar"
9/15/2011,"also do people actually fly the eos because lol ""it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths."" - abrazzar"
9/15/2011,mining in nullsec? the reward of mining 6 jetcans of ore per hour (minimum) with a dedicated hauler alt going between hulk(s) and rorqual.
9/15/2011,im not sure if the reason it is this way is because ccp dont want to have deal with fixing broken grids.
9/15/2011,maybe introducing module that prevents non-grid bonuses to apply? kind of communication countermeasures.
9/15/2011,"with reward you talking about, reward its none almost spend time and noting els ;( dis days mining is worst profesion in eve, max wath you can ern per hour is 25 milj mining arkonor bistot, so tell me how the poor miner with such income will genareta back his lost rork how much hours its takes to mine so much minerals back to replace it with all fiting.i not talking that evrage income per hour its verry poor that is 11 milj per hour with one hulk by perfect boosting, by mining randome ores. so for rorqual need to mine around 181 hours with one hulk. so look numbers and befor posting somting calcualte how that guy will ern back that money and if there is eny good reward at all.this days ppl mining not for money eny more:1, they minign for fun - to rest from hard work day.2. they minign thatthey like to mine and chill in chats and voice.if wie wish keep 0.0 mining att al in eve wie ned to create buble around hiden belts that one shjip with guns cant warp in it, that comes out form current mining incomes."
9/15/2011,"the above post melted my brain.however, if you do that then people will just get better at gridfu, and put the booster at a pos anyway. you will see them in their wtf grid sitting at 100,000km from your fight, and the grid will earn its name again."
9/15/2011,"this means that the whole fleet has to stay together in the system. eg: you cant have the heavy ships shooting a pos and the lights camping the in gate.also, the fleet command ships will need to be reworked to be able to have buffer tanks comporable to the damnation; the eos and the claymore will need to lose their lolrep bonuses in favour of some kind of ehp boost. shield tanking fleet commands may also need their slot layout revising, as the command processors replace tanking mids.being required to be on grid would make t3 gangboosters effectively useless."
9/15/2011,"supported, currently with t3 ships, gang links mean very low maintnence, almost risk free alts and don't bring anything to the game beside spreadsheet statistics, it's not just about the pos, it's also about being almost unprobable"
9/15/2011,"maybe what it means is that you need two fleets. or that you need boosters in every wing. or that you need to properly separate your squads or wings and have a supplemental booster with an appropriate ship. this seems very natural to me and i don't know why it seems to be a concern for you. you simply need enough qualified commanders and people who will fly ships with links.gang link ships can be made completely combat worthy. command ships and strategic cruisers are renowned for their ability to tank. sure, they can't fit the most epic tank once you fit them properly (with gang links) but doesn't that make sense?that is a completely separate problem.it certainly would not. it would make useless ships useless (six gang-link tengu anybody?). there are plenty of combat effective t3 gang booster fits and i see them used regularly. you might even come to think of them as more useful, because if the gang links have to be on grid, what better way to make it less obvious which ship has them than to put them on a t3 and blend in with the other strategic cruisers? it might mean you have to choose which bonuses you want, which again i would argue is a good thing."
9/15/2011,"by the way, just letting you know that your suggestion encourages blobs ""it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths."" - abrazzar"
9/15/2011,"please expand on this. maybe with three more one-line posts in a row.do you mean that it would encourage fleets to be larger to fit in a gang link ship? because i believe i am suggesting that the alt who (under current mechanics) sits off-grid gets replaced with a real player who is on-grid. assuming a fixed number of pilots, that's actually one less in the gang because there isn't a purpose for the alt anymore.maybe you mean that solo players who use link alts will become a gang of two, thereby doubling in size! clearly this cannot be allowed, as twice as many pilots on grid (regardless of whether they were in system before) is most certainly a blob.do you, instead, mean that any suggestion about improving eve encourages blobbing because it's a simple one-liner to get people to poo poo it? because i have no argument for that."

9/15/2011,"cyno scouts and rokh bombers are relatively easy to train and can be bought on the bazaar for reasonable prices. it would be nothing for those guys to jump characters now and have new names, new sec status, new everything, and you'd have to learn a whole new set of names.i don't know if others are proposing the ability to change names just whenever you want, but i think it should only be during character transfer."
9/15/2011,"my philosophy is this: we can argue about the fine details later, lets just work past this ignorance that ""name changing is going to cause the apocalypse""i'll add that to the debated feature section"
9/15/2011,"i think that the pro's of allowing 'name changing' far outweigh the con's and i am yet to see an argument in this thread that suggests otherwise. the minor inconvenience that would be caused by checking a character's aka tab, as you would with employment history for instance should not act as a barrier to add this highly sought-after feature.i feel that the op has accounted for all avenues where this feature could be exploited by indicating that name changing would bear a real cost - whether isk or real money (not ***** aurum plz); time-limiting the number of name changes (much like re-mapping) and incorporating an easily accessed tab in character's profile that will provide anyone in the eve community with an easy overview of the player's previous names.unless i am missing a key mechanic of the game that would be broken by this action, i simply cannot see the logic that would prevent the implementation of this feature."
9/15/2011,"according to terms of service, harassment is against the rules of eve. any player that is harassed has all rights to demand that ccp protects them. i wouldn't be against special actions for special circumstances (think witness protection program), but this is not scope of op."
9/15/2011,so we should change the whole system for a pathelogical case that happens once in a blue moon?
9/15/2011,"this is exactly why you should not have been voted into the csm. downvoting a good idea for a simply stupid and ignorant reason just reinforces my impression of you being an idiot.i am sure i am not the only one who feels this way...agreed with the op and ""liked"". if properly implemented this can be a good thing for both the community and ccp. i personally have no problem with my name or any of the names of any of my alts but i know quite a few people who wouldn't mind changing thier names. ccp...there is profit to be had here!"
9/15/2011,"*if* any such feature existed outside of the character transfer mechanic, it should be cosmetic only, in that a name change would not remove you from anyone's contact list. in fact, i'd go so far as to automatically append a contact list entry with (aka ________) so they easily know who they're seeing.i agree that in eve, reputation is an asset and a major part of the game. your actions should be forever tied to you. however, when a character is bought off the bazaar, you are not the one responsible for that character's previous actions. if you buy a toon who has scammed people for billions, you shouldn't inherit all the hate that goes with it just because there wasn't anything google could find about them.of course then there's the problem of transferring toons between accounts to rename...not sure how i'd handle that. wiping out their contact list would be a start...if you get a free pass off everyone's contact list you shouldn't be able to keep yours."
9/15/2011,"but then transfer becomes way to clear bad rep. simply transfer your character to another account you own, and get free card out of jail. there is simply no way to know who is behind character. that's why rep has to stay with character at all times."
9/15/2011,"i would not support this unless it was extremely costly, or could happen on a very infrequent basis. maybe there needs to be a better warning when you originally name the character that this is forever.the name in eve is how you are known and should be constant. unless they come up with a heck of a lot more icons or some way to make notes on a character appear when hovered over in local, i would have a hard time accepting the ability to change names.also, when recruiting, this is going to add a lot more time and effort to check backgrounds. forum searches on every name they ever used, google search on every name they have used would make it harder to do a proper background check.i assume each name could still not be reused, so more and more names are going to be tied up, which will lead to more and more use of stupid characters in the name making it even harder to search and remember a person.overall this is such a minor feature, would require some serious additions to the game and add very little in return to gameplay. let ccp concentrate on more important matters than intorducing a name change mechanism."
9/15/2011,"as to my suggestion ao name change forum, similar to the character bazaar.an easily searchable forum where when a name is changed, you have to post.*sample post*name changed from anewb to noob. *end sample post*i think it is unnecessary, but everyone seems to believe they can stalk the person whom first podded them based on their character name.if you are so scared about people scamming you then don't accept characters that have had name changed, seems like a simple policy to me.*sample policy*recruitment note - we will not be accepting characters whom have used the name change feature within the last 6 months.*end sample policy*i propose that everyone for this ability demonstrate how easy it is to scam those whom are against the ability using one of the other ways. like creating a trial alt, creating a regular alt, buying a new charater using the character transfer, hire someone to do it, or become a corp thief with your main. i think that covers it, but i'm sure there are other creative people out there.on the issue of lowsec pirates, maybe check their sec status? check local and see if anyone has gcc? seems like a whole lot less work than remembering a dozen names.i've had several characters over the years and most who knew me then still call me by my origional character's name.if reputation based on character name is so important to you, then don't chage your name!"
9/15/2011,"this crappy forum ate my original post... ><anywho, here is a quick summary:1) if it was isk, yes i agree it should be very costly. if it was real money, it should be no more than a character transfer fee is currently for example. and again no ***** aurum thnx. i would also go as far as supporting a 24-month timer on name changes.2) instead of icons, alerts and air-horns going off whenever somebody that had name-changed jumped into system - how about an aka tab in the character sheet? if you have the person set as red, you are likely to double click them anyway if they were unfamiliar to you. likewise i would support a contact-list update when name-change is made.3) background checking should not take you more than a couple minutes more with name changing allowed on 12- or 24-month basis. also, please do not work on the assumption that everyone in eve will instantly change their name if this feature was implemented.4) i agree that not having the ability to re-use a changed name would decrease the pool of available names to new players. but bear in mind that having the ability to have 2 alts on your character is probably a far greater name-pool-sink than name-changing could ever be. again, not everyone will instantly use this feature and pay $ to change their name, knowing that it is a purely cosmetic feature. however, having the option to do so may allow some players that bought characters or would like a change of their name for superficial reasons to do so.5) i am no dev, but adding an aka tab in the character sheet and updating contact lists when a name-change is implemented does not seem like an awful lot of work as everything else remains the same. even if it took some more significant implementation, the earning potential of this feature should certainly be an inticing factor for ccp."
9/15/2011,"....which is pretty much what i said in the last line that you cut out of the quote, and the one misgiving i'd have for implementing this at all.of course, it's also quite possible to purchase yourself a clean rep now by simply selling your toon and buying a new one. if reputation is so critical that no one should ever be allowed to work under a different name, alts shouldn't exist and we should all have only one identity.this gets....complicated.edit: i'm going to take the slippery slope down the ""reputation must be maintained"" line just to show how far it can go. don't think i'm trying to invalidate the argument, i just want to show how many ways ""reputation"" is diluted now.we shouldn't allow name changes because reputation is very important.-- but toons can be transferred and sold, meaning a person with a bad reputation can buy a ""clean"" toonwe shouldn't allow character transfers at all, because people shouldn't be able to get that clean slate.-- but a you can have multiple accounts, one with a good reputation and the other doing all the bad stuff, sometimes to ""friends"" of the good guy.we shouldn't allow multiple accounts, because it allows you to do things without them impacting your reputation.-- but you can create three toons on one account, so they can still do that, just not at the same time.we should restrict accounts to one toon per account.-- but if someone ruins their own reputation, they can biomass and start over.we should stop the ability to biomass toons.the only way for reputation to really, really matter is for you to only ever be allowed one eve character. if you can biomass, you can reset your reputation. if you can make alts, you can engage in nefarious activities without spoiling your ""good"" reputation. if you can trade characters, you can buy toons with good reputations regardless of how you've acted for years.i'm not advocating for a world where we can change our names for free whenever we want. i'm just saying that this idea that your name is somehow forever tied to your actions in eve is a myth."

9/15/2011,"this is different i think and if true (i haven't experimented with the mechanics) should probably be revisited. if you can actively counter me and i have no game mechanic with which to fight back then this is probably deserves some game mechanics tweaking. if it's just a matter of some guy in local hiding so it keeps you on edge, learn to deal with it."

9/15/2011,"adding statistical information to the listings of planets colonized under the planetary interface tab would greatly assist pilots by allowing a quick overview of important detailed information regarding the installations on the particular planet listed.the csm could request feedback regarding which particular overview information would be most relevant, such as remaining extractor program times, current storage capacities, and installations idle, etc.with ccp's (as i understand) philosophy of helping players cut through processes in order to get on with what they want to do, the current iteration requires a pilot to double click the planetary interface entry in the science and industry window; enter the planetary interface in order to assess the status of their colony even when no maintenance is required. as such this is a very inefficient method for this user interface, and it really should be improved upon.this sums up my suggestion, and i hope it is minor enough that it can move to the top of the 'to do' list for ccp.regards,kass"

9/15/2011,ecm is only preferred in fleet engagements when i do small gang work we much prefer td's to any other racial ewar types ( as they effect the most ships and don't require a special hull to be used for high effect).also neutering a races recon line is just plain wrong. why would anyone risk a falcon/rook for a *chance* to be effective. fc's want to know that things are going to work if it isn't they might as well bring dps.

9/16/2011,"the reason it encourages more blobbing is because practically no one is willing to sit in an unarmed ganglink ship in the middle of a fight, especially if they are heavily outnumbered. if you did put the link ship on grid in we'll say a 2 v 10 fight including the link ship, the very first thing that would happen is the other fleet would nuke the ganglink ship or drive it off grid, and then subsequently crush the lone combat ship.currently it works a bit different in the right hands. the boosting ship is reasonably safe because that 10 man blob didn't bother to bring a prober. all 10 of them are also obsessed with km whoring so no one brought a link ship of their own either. as a result, the lone combat ship on grid facing off against the 10 man gang is able to kite them or in some cases tank them (at least for a while) and put up a decent fight.like it or not, off grid boosting is currently about the only thing keeping ""solo"" and small gang pvp alive. remove it, and anyone that's alone is just cannon fodder for the 30 man bc/bs gangs with full logi support and a cyno to titan bridge in 500 more if needed. and they won't hesitate to use it all against a single nano-cane if they can catch it. the only counter to that blob mentality is to stay out of hard tackle range so they can't all pile on you so easily. and it by no means makes you invincible either, all it takes is a single rapier on their side and they'll blob you to death regardless.i believe boosting is working as intended and to change it as proposed would be a serious blow to the game as a whole. the absolute last thing this game needs is changing mechanics to favor blobbing even more heavily."
9/16/2011,"i'd actually love to see the stats on pilots sitting in logi and command link ships inside npc corps, actually.i've always been a big proponent for ending neutral rr/cmd boosts in hisec and the like, but then incursions pretty much solidified that that mechanic is here forever.i can definitely get on board with this idea, though. and i come from the position of someone that actively takes advantage of this mechanic. i'm all for a nerf, since it would make for better, balanced pvp."
9/16/2011,"<U+FFFD> because a 1 v 10 fight wouldn't have simply squashed the lone combat ship, off-grid booster or not?i'm not sure what point you were trying to make there. at present, flying a logistics or ecm ship in a fleet means you get primaried. those ships are still used in combat. as to your assertion about ""unarmed ganglink ship"", wouldn't forcing link ships on-grid encourage people to explore fits that don't try cramming 6 warfare links onto one paper thin hull?wouldn't it be interesting to have squad, wing and fleet commanders all providing boosts of some kind?"
9/16/2011,"pretty much this. although your example is a bit flawed, a more reasonable example is a 15-man gang. you have a wc 5 claymore in the wing command slot and everyone else is in cynabals, vagabonds, huginns and lachesis. an erebus is dropped on the gang and the claymore is doomsdayed, the lachesis and huginn pilots are revealed to be spies and proceed to point and web their buddies so they can get taken out one by one by the maniacal titan pilot's guns.a 20-man gang in sniper hacs take out the claymore before the other ships can burn to them, the long-range tackle bonuses are gone and they just go home because being kited is boring.(this example is probably unrealistic but i really can't think of anything better right now) ""it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths."" - abrazzar"
9/16/2011,"no. as previously mentioned, this would break gang bonuses. stop trying to remove legitimate features of the game and think of ways to add more features."
9/16/2011,"just a thought, but maybe a compromise would be that only command ships can pass gang links in fr om off grid. means you could have offsite boosters, but only if there was a command ship in the squad ongrid to pass down the bonus' from higher up the chain.it would maintain the flexibility of fleets that are spread out over a solar system, but increase the vulnerabilty of a squad using offgrid boosters. you could destroy the command ship and effective cut the chain of boosts.edit: by command ships i mean both command ships and t3 ships with the command subsystem."
9/16/2011,"you are assuming that the ""fix"" made it easy to probe down fits specifically designed to avoid it .. max skills, rigged and implanted coverts if you want any hope in hell of doing it any sort of respectable time.and what is your combat ships supposed to do while your prober tried to nail the t3 somewhere in deep space (i still have 60au+ bms in small systems, because off-plane does not include up/down according to gm )? that is the reason for blobbing, you need the extra 40-50% to make up the difference that a booster provides unless you have one of your own .. because one does not jump into a system and waits for a ready opponent to sacrifice their links nor will the opponent give you time to find the blasted things.which is a huge part of the problem and why such a change is going to be damn hard to push through, people have simply become accustomed to having one ship augmenting <250. here's an idea, instead of having one super-gimped flimsy and toothless linkship with 4-6 links, you combat fit them complete with tanks/dps and either chose which advantage you want or bring more than one.let's look at another very common force multiplier; can you imagine how broken a guardian having a system-wide aoe rr field to tending an entire fleet would be .. doesn't matter if it was made of tissue paper and the size of a moon on probes it would still be broken beyond comprehension .. that is where off-grid links are now.solution?:- commandships have been needing a once-over for a while, increase the tank of the link platforms slightly and change what needs to be changed in regards to the links (info link ""lolz"").- t3 command subsystem changed to decrease signature slightly and allows for two links right off the bat.it will have a severe impact on some ""solo"" pvp'ers, but then they are not really soloing any more than they are with failcon alts, neut. rr alts, orca alts etc. .. so screw them."
9/16/2011,"honestly, this whole proposal sounds a lot like ""i can't fly a certain type of ship and i feel that because of that no one else should be able to have something better than what i can use because that's totally unfair"" type of proposal.besides whats already been stated, i'd only support this if grids worked 100% correctly 100% of the time. i've been in fleet fights before where i run off grid at somewhat random locations, separating fleets in abnormal ways. in those cases, i'd rather not be penalized gang-bonus wise for something i nor any of the other pilots in fleet can change."
9/16/2011,"i agree that there needs to be a warningyour name is not 'constant.' see character transfers and alts -- they've been around forever and the world has not endedif you're even considering doing a background check on someone with more than one or two aliases you're doing it wrongmost of these names will be changed for a reason -- they're undesirable. to some it may be minor, to others it may be essential (roleplayers) or even encouraging to continue paying and playing (people with ""unfortunate"" names) -- no matter what the case, it is profitable!"
9/16/2011,"does an ingame name identify a corp thief, or the avatar that a corp thief was playing?if the avatar is no longer owned by the ""real person"" who committed a theft...is that avatar, under its new owner, still a corp thief?the name of the avatar, tells you absolutely nothing about who is playing the avatar. and with how easy it is to transfer a toon, the history you think you know about an avatar, is ultimately meaningless."
9/16/2011,"this is my third attempt to post in this thread keeps going wrong everytime i click post just deletes what written.on black ops i would like the jump drive range to exceed the jump bridge range on them.bridge range would be capped at say 6.5ly but the jump drive range would be not double but close leave at that.now if bring recons or something with black ops can jump bit further with them,if only black ops can jump to a covert cyno to hot drop someone further away.when i first found out that black ops couldnt warp cloaked i wasnt impressed,but when i was in my first black ops fleet i realised that they dont need it."

9/16/2011,eve pve is dull. making it look shiny is not going to change things.
9/16/2011,"making the game visually stunning is always something of a priority for ccp. they've been consistently updating and improving the graphics in the three expansions i've seen released. if you read the dev blogs they routinely talk about graphic improvements alongside gameplay.now if you're suggesting ""make it prettier"" be the top priority for ccp, i suggest you kindly keep your ideas to yourself. there are a lot of things that will make this game more fun to play, instead of just looking at it.pve won't ever look like that because you don't see pve fleets larger than about 10 ships, pve is usually fought at range, and the play style for pve generally has you spend a lot of time zoomed out and looking at tiny icons instead of seeing the scale of the ships.while i'm not one to tell you to go pvp if that's not what you want to do, in this case i think it's true: the epic fleet battles and in-your-face visuals are in pvp because pvp naturally produces more of those images."

9/16/2011,"jams are the most powerful ewar in eve.... this is because they prevent all external actions a ship can perform, eliminating the ewar they provide, the majority of their dps, and their tackle.... to balance this, jams are supposed to be chance based. the truth is though, they are not chanced based on a significant number of ships. i think that your formula is off, as it gives too much improvement to unbonused jammers, and deminishes the jamming bonus gained from bonused jammers. i think a much better formula would be: chance to jam = min (0.96, x/y). this way there is always a 1/25 chance of missing a jam, but you maintain the current jam strength/signal strength balance."

9/17/2011,"you can read this however you like, but know that most fleets i participate in have gang links present. i certainly do not want for more links. anybody is capable of putting links on a ship and parking it in space (or next to a station or in a pos). it's much harder to make decisions about what links work best with your fleet while still allowing you to survive on the battlefield. so it's not about what i can't do, it's about what is a silly mechanic. as has been pointed out already by people opposing the idea, nobody wants to fly a combat ineffective link ship -- so nobody does; instead, the job is shluffed off onto alt. instead of making it a role so easy an alt can do it, why not make it a role so interesting a player will do it?"
9/17/2011,"wut? you forgot to add logic to your post. i point out that the only fleet command ship able to stay on the field in fleet fights is the damnation, you say that fleet command ships are supposed to be tanky, then admit that the rest of them aren't tanky enough, but that's not a problem when we're proposing forcing them to all be on grid.active tanking has been an irrelevance for fleet fights for years. it seems to me that when you're proposing a change to fleet command ships work in fleet fights, then a look at the ship bonuses might perhaps be a very unseperate problem indeed."
9/17/2011,"you can twist and rewrite my words all you want, but that doesn't mean i said what you want me to have said. also, just because you have a fleet fight doesn't mean you instantly have to have a fleet command ship just because the word fleet has been used in both instances. capacitor boosters are not the same as shield boosters just because they are both post-fixed with ""boosters"".i say that active tanking is a separate issue because it is an issue that needs to be tackled with more classes of ships in mind than simply command. or, as commonly happens, needs to be tackled by simply choosing the ship that works better at the moment in the same way that you might choose armor over shield. i have seen claymores, sleipners, damnations, vultures, legions, lokis all used as gang link ships to good effect -- on grid and in combat. i have never seen an eos or astarte because ~information warfare links are silly. which again, is a separate issue that affects this issue, but is not the same as requiring links to be on-grid.it also seems to be a little-known fact that you can use battlecruisers to provide gang links."
9/17/2011,"10v1 isn't nearly as one sided as you might think. when solo, i typically fly one of the following ships1) arty cane2) curse3) rapierall of these can orbit at 30km+ and fight effectively with a loki booster alt. the arty cane does 550 dps (4k volley) and is pretty cheap. the t2 disruptor on it has a 34km base range and 40km with heat. it also goes over 1700m/s without heat, ensuring it's among the faster ships out there excluding frigates.the last one i lost was attacking an obvious bait and this scenario is pretty typical these days. it was a myrmidon sitting in a belt just waiting for me to attack (i was the only other guy in system) but i knew he had at least an absolution with him sitting one jump away. knowing he couldn't point me back easily, i warped in at range and attacked. i held about 30km off and slowly worked him down. he was active tanked but sooner or later he'd run out of boosters. i was hoping he'd call in the abso to save him, that would have been a nicer kill. instead they threw a proteus with a faction scram at me.i was able to hold range for a pretty long time and had him worked down to low armor despite his 200k+ ehp tank. unfortunately, i drifted a little too close and he got the scram on me. at which point all his buddies piled in and took me down in seconds. however, that proteus was likely very worried as i had him down to around 10% armor when i popped, a few more volleys and i would have taken him down with me, or possibly even gotten away. if i'd had a wingman, i don't think there is any question that i would have won. and this is a case of me losing such a fight. typically i score a kill or two and then escape.this thread really does look like a case of you just moaning about being unable to use the ship yourself. off grid boosters are very much a field leveling tool. they allow you to take a small weakness in an enemy fleet composition and convert it into a huge gaping whole that a heavily outnumbered force can pull a victory from. the loki + nano ship is the simplest and most obvious example, but a well flown active tanked ship + appropriate tanking bonus booster can be just as effective if dps/tracking is the opposing fleet's weakness."
9/17/2011,"so it all boils down to: link ships can't survive on-grid as numbers increase. wonder if there is some other ships that are viable in large fleet (read: blob) scenarios that can field gang-links?all capitals except lol-dreads are designed to field links. how is that for buffered on-grid link platform for you.sure they don't have the command efficiency bonuses to give that extra 10%, but with proper skills they'll still be more than enough to turn a battle around. hell, up until the afk t3-booster scourge you still saw regular t1 bcs running around with links."
9/17/2011,yawn... do all the csm just post and run?
9/17/2011,"which timer is used?in a big brawl with say ten guardians, all inter-connected via cap.trans. but repairing 3-4 different targets .. which timer is transmitted though a logistics chain?if it is the highest then one person who missed the disengage order can 'strand' the lot of them when the dps vacates.if it is the lowest then you can decloak a covert for a single cycle and the whole chain is aggression free within a few seconds."
9/17/2011,"it'd be the highest. if an idiot who ignores the disengage order keeps firing, then everyone either has to stop assisting him (at which point their timers begin to tick down), or he has to stop shooting.if you can't coordinate your gang well enough to extract yourself, then that's on you."
9/17/2011,"here's an idea to prevent docking to escape the deputies. you said yourself that we may as well accept incarna and start incorporating it in our ideas. i recall a dev saying something to the effect of ""there will be no combat in stations, for now."" that leaves me to believe that at some point there will be that possibility. how about, if you're currently under a gcc, deputies can dock and incapacitate/arrest you and, if you resist, kill you. would be a tough decision there. keep warping and risk your ship, or dock and try to hide from deputies with stun guns and rifles. there would have to be something done to make the risk of docking at least somewhat appealing, say having no beacon on you in station and your gcc expires faster. deputies would only get a photo of your face, like a mug shot, so you could hide in some dark corner or something to that effect. just throwing it out there.the entire concept is of low-sec enforcement is probably one of the most compelling ideas posted here in, well, ever and i fully and completely endorse it. my hat is off to the op for coming up with the first real idea for rejuvenating low-sec. +1"
9/17/2011,"i would support this.the thing is, you will never see those kind of stunning displays in actual pvp fleet action. it's always lagged to oblivion, with swarms of drones around, and blobs of tc/eccm/amp effects butchering whatever remains when you turn off brackets. if ccp alleviates lag, fleet size will just increase until lag is again achieved.some pve eye candy of what we don't get to see in pvp isn't exactly a bad idea. obviously those will have to be just lcos for window dressing, since actual people would produce lag and warrant extensive gameplay change for pve."
9/17/2011,"it will change things for the beginners in the game, they are the ones who suffer though the visual dulness fest.. i say, stop making station environments shiny (only for a few weeks period) and start making the outside environments shinier, just give it a little love baby"
9/17/2011,"the more efficient and refined the pi interface the more likely wider participation...ulimately those who actually know and use pi - particularly those like myself that produce tier 4 product(s) know that pi is not just a dust 514 sideshow. ccp made a great decission moving the old trade goods to being player made commodities... and unless or until these commodities become obsolete, then pi is an important fledgling industry in new eden that devs nor the csm should ignore."
9/17/2011,"supported.on the pi tab i would like to see: whats being extracted, whats being produced [*] weather extractors are running or not."
9/17/2011,"the ""fluffers solution"" to dealing with a falcon:step 1: get a droneboat with a drone link augmentor and decent tankstep 2: set drones to ""aggressive""step 3: land on fieldstep 4: deploy a full flight of warrior iis, hobgoblin iis, or valkyrie iisstep 5a: lock up the falcon when it appears on field and send the drones to attack itstep 5b: if the falcon locks and ecms you first, no worries. your drones will automatically engage it anyways.step 6: waiteither the falcon will warp off because it's taking too much damage (falcons have ""lol"" tanks unless they give up some ecm ability for better shields) or it will die.the same solution can be used against rooks (as they are pretty squishy too), but you need a better tank as it can actually deal damage."
9/17/2011,
9/18/2011,"this is a great idea and it covers both sides of teh problem, supported."
9/18/2011,bump because it's needed.
9/18/2011,agree & bump let's go - do it - hello?
9/18/2011,"this is one hell of a idea. i came in here expecting to make fun of you op, but you are right this is not expected. a change like this is what low sec needs right now, and i really doubt pirates would mind this because it gets them fights. i mean comon just picturing now a solo raven attempting to play sheriff would be amazing kills, but the idea goes beyond that. another method of earning iskis pvping is never a bad idea, and this adds a new life to a otherwise boring dead part (for the most part) area of eve."
9/18/2011,"i sincerely hope that ccp notices this post and seriously considers implementing this or similar systems. lowsec really is just a joke.on another note, lp concord store anyone? concord battleship blueprints... yummy."
9/18/2011,"cloaking in system, disrupting an enemies isk making capacity and killing occasional stupid people is a totally valid tactic and should be welcome within the game.cloaking your ship in space, then going to work/bed/out drinking to disrupt enemy isk making isnt and should not be allowed, some mechanic to stop it is needed. there should be no way to affect other players from getting on with their game unless you are sat at your pc actually playing eve. you can even log back in after dt using a remote desktop which can be done very easily. this is a massively abused tactic.basically, if you arnt actually playing eve, at your computer, you should not be able to affect what other players are doing, even if it is only psychologically."
9/18/2011,"sorry but i thought this game was about tactics and counters, hasn't it been said time and time again by ccp that there should be no ""i win "" button in the game. for every tactic there is a counter, for every mod there is a counter, for every gameplay style there is a counter. this is true for everything in the game but 1 and thats the cloak. the secound you turn it on you win because no-one can stop you from that point on. i don't care what the counter is to cloaking but there needs to be one, if it's a fuel bay then fine. if it's a 4 hour mod cycle timer then fine, even if it's a pos mod that takes an hour or 2 to scan the system and finds everything in the system weather cloaked or not then thats fine to. but there must be a counter to the cloak or it is the i win button of this game. to the people who say that people will find ways around it well thats true and you know thats fine 2 as long as there are counters to it."
9/18/2011,what i have been saying for ages now is to remove the ability of a cov ops cloaked ships to field regular cynos and increase the jump range and fuel bay of black ops by 50% and increase a black ops effective hitpoints by 25%. ditch conventional cynos ability on cov ops cloak ships in exchange for a much better black ops/bridge cov ops gangs.
9/18/2011,"that is the beginning of a new problem altogether first ccp buffs dreads, then battleship pilots will want a buff to fight the dreads, then so on and so forth down to the frigs then, after everyone gets a buff, the super pilots start complaining that they have been left out now we are back at square onenot to mention, all the work that this creates for ccp (meaning they most likely won't do it) the months of bitching griping and complaining this creates (same crap going on now) and all those changes leave more room for error (way op'ed battleships or something)"
9/18/2011,making something tedious and irritating to do will not stop someone doing it if it gets them enough advantage all that will happen if people have to keep their super caps fuled is that they will do it and hate having to do it it won't stop the super-cap bloband pos fuel prices would rise which would suck

9/19/2011,"combat probes, use them you must"
9/19/2011,"i can go with this one. it always seemed weird that with no intel, sight or any connection to a battlefield, a command ship is ""commanding"" the fight. this would certainly help aliviate other issues as well. such as, t3's being better command ships than a purpose built command ship, offgrid/pos boosters, and command alts. (personally, i think if you can play the game afk and still produce a noticable effect you should suffer a nerf.) even froma pve perspecive, this would kill the 6 link tengus for incursion fleets."
9/19/2011,jag kara gets it...flank steak does not.
9/19/2011,"with ccp needing additional revenue sources, this seems like a home run. it would seem it should be easy to implement. i would think it could even be implemented using the petition system and require that much less programming to make it automated.with all of the nay-sayers whom complain of reputation and corp thieft, i still don't see any potential argument that would justify not allowing this feature. there are simply to many other ways to become someone else, this would simply become yet another way.the only 'problem' i see with it is people changing their name from anewb to znewb so they're not primary.... it still makes ccp money and it will allow you to make fun of people with names like zzzzzzzzzznewb."
9/19/2011,"i was at first giving the current csm the benifit of the doubt despite the chairman and his less than stellar reputation regarding all things eve...however...i am completely convinced now that it is all about the goonswarm agenda. pretty much every post i see from a csm rep is drivel and nonsense. i would much rather see a post from a dev who has some common sense then some ""wannabe attorney"" csm rep.so...any dev want to make a meaningful comment in this thread?"
9/19/2011,"personally, i think this could be slimmed down by simply giving all players a number (which already exists as far as i know). this number would be used in linking profiles, setting standings, etc. as an example ""bob"" aka ""registered capsuleer 208456"" changes his name to ""steve"", like wise known as ""registered capsuleer 208456"", will auto be associated with ""bob"" based on their id number.this would make it much easier to distinguish between people too, as to search someone it could go from looking up ""bob"" and recieving results on every one with the combination of letters bob and having to search for them, to just looking up 208456 and having no confusion.this method could similarily be applied to alliances and corps, as they would be easily trackable with it. as well as it would open the possibility of allowing possible repeats of names, as confusion can be prevented by the numerical difference between characters. (not that im looking to see 500 john smiths in the john smith corp, show up in a battle and having to call primaries.)"
9/19/2011,that isn't a bad idea at all. would said id number be something the pilot knows? this might allow for duplicate names which i think would be freaking cool. ruining somebody els's rep...lol fun times. if you know what your number is you can have someone add you to contacts or email or whatever using said number instead of the name to clear up any confusion with duplicate names.
9/19/2011,"that was more or less the idea, if you can track them based on a unique number that will never change, why would you need to worry abut naming confusion.and yes, you would know it. it could be as simple as next to your name it says your id number."
9/19/2011,"this is easily the best suggestion i've seen concerning this matter. very much supported.also: now the ""support"" button is gone, and we still can't have a frigging vote function with these super-unbelievably-awesome forums they spent so much time coding on?"
9/19/2011,ya.
9/19/2011,i'm still surprised they do so much to change the game and still brush over this.
9/19/2011,"as cool as this looks, imagine them being blown up by the next fleet to come along, simply because they look cool. i like it, i think... but they can go boom..."
9/19/2011,"you've failed to explain how a ship, cloaked, unmoving in space with no one at the keyboard is actually winning anything.the problem isn't the cloaked ship. the problem is that you're afraid of the pilot you see in local that you don't know and can't find."
9/19/2011,nerf being afk while in station or pos
9/19/2011,nerf afk cloaking by nerfing the infallible intelligence source known as local. this will empower non-afk cloakers and all will be well with new eden.
9/19/2011,why are you flying a billion isk ship in null-sec at a location that anybody can warp to without alerting you to their presence? any battlecruiser or stealth bomber will do for belt rats.
9/19/2011,so what you are saying is that you would be okay if the player cloaked is removed from local after some period of inactivity correct? and if active again will show up in local again right?then why not support a solution instead of waxing two pages of politico

9/20/2011,"sorry to be rude but most people have no idea how the gang links work.1. gang links dont work in warp so ship needs to be stationary.2. gang links dont work when cloaked.3. if cs is on grid nobody is calling it primary due to huge tank capability. if you call a cs primary you are doing somethink wrong.4. if you cant kill a stationary uncloaked ship you suck at game.and btw that someone has a pos is no reason to nerf somethink becouse everyone and his grandmother has pos for staging caps, fleets etc..."
9/20/2011,"that's genius. i don't know why i didn't think to ask the gang to sit politely on their gate while i warp off to dock, get into a ship with a probe launcher, probe out their alt, take him out and get back to gate for a quick fight.and, thank you, i know how gang links work. i still think it makes absolutely no sense to promote a meta where it's beneficial to have an alt in a combat ineffective ship sitting in space, at a pos, next to a station or otherwise not being part of the combat that it is providing spreadsheet statistics to.finally, i would like to point out that everyone and his mother do not have a pos for staging caps and fleets. not all space battles are for sovereignty or involve capitals. many of the better space battles involve fleets of single digit size. gang sizes keep getting bigger because people keep adding alts and parking them in space."
9/20/2011,"given the force-multiplier, if the cs is in a gang of more than 10 or so fighters, you'd be doing something wrong not calling it primary after you've taken care of ecm and logistics."
9/20/2011,"i messed up my original name and spent weeks trying to think of a new one, feeling the pressure of it. it pretty much broke the experience for me.ultimately any problems that people can think up with name changing are problems with solutions, and not even difficult solutions.i particularly like the ""cooling off"" idea."
9/20/2011,"i sincerely hope that if they do, i get something out of it. free eve for life, or a really wicked unique ship.i'm a fan of cloaky cruisers. hint hint."
9/20/2011,ever wondered about how boring lowsec can be and how it could be changed. that's in fact a very good idea. would like to see that coming. thumbs up!
9/20/2011,"while interesting this idea is a little one sided isn't it? i mean everything i'm reading is about killing pirates, attacking people with gcc and destroying a viable and flourishing play-style choice. which no one asked you to destroy.the only people that don't like low sec are those that don't understand it, or are afraid of it. if anything gcc needs to be limited not expanded. if you want to kill pirates then come into low sec and try.this idea has some merit, but it'll never fly."
9/20/2011,"a question....how the #### do you know that cloaker is really there (not afk)?by your logic.... its a valid tactic...but no one in their right brain would ever ""answer"" in local if they are there if their soul purpose is to spy.hypocritical much?seriously people...get over yourselves.... afk or not...the point is... it wont matter a damn if ccp nerfs local..you'll just ***** about something else.================ stop the evemail spam!"
9/20/2011,"let them use fuel, so they run out."
9/20/2011,cloaks are fine... it's people expecting bunnies and flowers in null sec that need to be fixed.
9/20/2011,"tbh cloakers in system don't really bother me, i deal with them in the same way i would any other neutral that comes around and that's mainly by ignoring them and getting on with playing the game the way i would if they hadnt been there in the first place.my problem is the fact that you can go into a system and do something that no one can counter, like i said in my original post i don't care what the counter is as long as there is a counter. you win because no one can do anything to stop you doing anything you want as long as you are cloaked. if that's not winning in this game then plz explain what you would accept as win in this game."
9/20/2011,and once again...you fail to answer the ultimate question.what can that cloaked ship do to you when its obviously no where in sight.the solution is to have a combat fleet ready to go and play it smart.complaing about it wnot solve anything.... a cloaked ship cannot use any modules short of propulsion....thats it.all you have is the presense of a nuet in system....or a red.... that's it.if local was removed...and it likely will be.... youd still be screwed over regardless.this entire arugment is a farse....total waste of time.the counter is obvious.use that head of yours....and stop whining.================ stop the evemail spam!

9/20/2011,"dreads are already significantly underpowered for the type of ship it is designed to be10 bs should not be able to nuke a dread in under two minutes, nor should the dread have to take 3 siege cycles to kill off a carrier dreads are only useful in site as designed to be, but the current state of dreads requires you to bring a 'blob' of them to be of any worth just to smash a posleave my supers the **** alone until you fix my ******* dreads if pos fuels are a requirement i want a mobile lab, optional forcefield and manufacturing thing in it so i can build my **** via my supers instead of wasting time fueling backup poses"

9/21/2011,or even before if it's not one of the cs with significant ehp bonuses (because the loleos isn't bad enough)
9/21/2011,"to do this, then they would have to change the mechanic so you can have multiple people boosting fleet at the same time, even if only one of the boosting is actually taking affect. this is because command ships can and will among the first targets in an engagment, so there need to be redundant boosters or else boosting becomes near useless in large fleets."
9/21/2011,"sorry but part of the consequence of doing crap to ruin the rep of a character is the destruction of the sale value. allowing people to change identities at all will allow people to use this as an exploit to avoid any consequence of actions other than a small service fee.i vote no friggon way! - remove the cloaked from local; free intel is the real problem, not ""afk"" cloaking -"
9/21/2011,"at one point the game didn't allow more than two word in character name and it also didn't allow any punctuation marks.there are people with typos in there character names.these are valid reasons to have one's name corrected, by a petition and gm intervention.pain is weakness leaving the body"
9/21/2011,"names and reputations should always stay with characters sold on bazaar. they cannot be allowed to change their name if the toon is bought. similarly if you change your name you can never sell your toon. reputation isn't rooted in you, the player. it's invested in the toon that earned the bad rep. if toon xxx became known as a notorious thief and pirate, this does not mean that the same player can't play another care bear toon. this is the basic tenant of any rpg. but, the notorious pirate should be penalized, for the rest of the characters life, for his sins. in other words, the sins are born by the toon not the player.. ( in contrast to floppy's post ) this is how legal entities work. a company can have bad debt or be legally sued, but that doesn't mean that the ceo is personally liable. as long as the sins of the toon are branded to the toon forever in implementation, i may support this feature."
9/21/2011,"not sure if serious...are you guys reading the previous posts before you post some of this stuff? let me try this final summary once again:it would be a cosmetic change only. the reputation of a toon, his/her standings and employment history, past transgressions, enemies, friends, contacts... all remain the same. there would be a clear indication in the biography of a character regarding any previous names. name-changing would be allowed very infrequently with a lengthy cool-off period.the inconvenience of checking an aka-tab in somebody's biography i do not feel justifies the absence of this feature (which judging by the 'likes' received is something people would like to see). unless you have a more compelling argument, please refrain from the whole ""toon should always be linked to his/her reputation"" - as nothing about this proposal allows anybody to escape this prospect."
9/21/2011,"it's not destroying anything. if you feel that this is one-sided against the pirates, then how about some ideas on how to balance it? right now all the advantage in lowsec goes to those who don't care about their sec status...the pirates. they can dictate the fight because the ""good guys"" can't engage just anyone. there is no incentive to go out to lowsec other than purely wanting to get involved in pvp at the cost of security status. even then it's hard to get a fight that isn't horribly one-sided or just run into a gang running disco on a gate or station. i'm trying to find a system which creates enough feeling of balance for all parties that more people go out into lowsec, creating more fights.i do understand lowsec. i've spent a fair bit of time on pvp roams and exploration there. i learned the hard way how to live out there for extended periods of time and got to know some of the people who live there. i'd wager that 95% of the lowsec occupants i met were pirates. they spent all their time fighting each other and ganging up on any passersby they didn't know and like. hell, half the ""friends"" i made out there i made because i successfully evaded their traps and stuck around in local to chat.this isn't just about killing pirates. this has always been about getting ships into lowsec, creating fleets, starting fights, and creating a ""stepping stone"" for younger/smaller groups that want a taste of fleet battles and sov without getting dragged into the politics and sheer scope of nullsec. i really think if something like this mechanic existed more carebear corps might venture out of high.(troll) that is, unless you're saying that you can't deal with a fleet of pubbies coming out to lowsec and trying to take you one. i understand. not everyone is up to that.(/troll):d"
9/21/2011,"most of us happen to like low sec just the way it is, and while certain elements need to be tweaked, addressed and otherwise balanced - we don't want low sec to become another null or hi-sec region. and that is what you are proposing.you make the assumption that something is wrong with low sec because more people aren't there and that by somehow making it ""safer"" more people would fly into low and have picnics. it won't happen. why? because people like me live there and i will only blow up their pretty little ships even more than i do now. boom. dead miners and carebear ships all over the place.your idea is interesting but if people had the guts to come into low sec they'd be coming into low sec. making bounty hunters or police or territory modules or any of the other ideas i've heard over the years won't change the fundamental issue - low sec is scary and bad people live there.i'm sorry about that. but me and all the other pirates like it like that. if it changes it won't be low sec anymore.now having said that, there are things that can be done. sec status is something that needs addressed, gcc needs to be fixed based on the true-sec status of systems and not just globally, and others. but anyone can already attack a pirate any time they want without taking a sec status hit and they don't do it."
9/21/2011,"this subject should be discussed in full detail, but the initial idea is worth supporting.+1"
9/21/2011,"i don't want to make it safer. i want to make it more dangerous for all parties. i want there to be battles, not little frig fights and the occasional roaming blob of doom that i see out there now. the problem as it is now is that the -10s are only threatened by each other, and anyone not looking to pirate really can't survive in lowsec. it's the least-populated part of space--from what i've seen--and the low popularity means that the hard truth of it is that ccp isn't going to care much what you think if they can find a way to make more players happy. i even recall some dev posts on the old forums about ""fixing lowsec"". i want to offer something that will augment lowsec and give the pirates more and bigger pvp fights. if you think my proposal won't do that i'd love to hear what you think might make low moit's not about having guts to go to lowsec. it's about having a reason to. right now the risk vs reward ratio is way out of balance with the rest of the game. my old corp ran mining operations in low just to see what kind of isk we could make...it wasn't significantly more profitable than highsec mining, and there was the constant threat of piracy. i ran exploration through there frequently, but again found highsec to pay equally well. basically right now there's one thing to do in non-fw lowsec: be a pirate or look for pirates. i know some people run l5s in them and there are some lowsec explorers, but for the most part the space goes unused."
9/21/2011,any real beginner in eve is in a rifter tackling the ships in fleets exactly like those the op linked.
9/21/2011,"here's a better idea. instead of making pve look shiny, why not make it fun?"
9/21/2011,i think there are more important things to 'fix' or improve other than the graphics right now.at least with the current graphics the current load on the computer and the internet is really really small.
9/21/2011,"while i agree with the statement of the last poster in so far as whiners should just be more combat ready, there is an psychological effect of having a red in local continuously. which is the reason why i advocate the timed removal from local for non active cloakers. it makes the difference between having to be combat ready 100% of the time, to just the time when the cloaker decides to activate a module, or decloak, or cyno."
9/21/2011,even then.... you choose to let that cloaker effect you to that degree. and if they accomplish that much... they win.================ stop the evemail spam!
9/21/2011,"of course... you can't do pretty much anything while cloaked either. you also can't do anything about people you wardec that stay in stations until you give up the dec. are they winning? really, really weak argument."
9/21/2011,"the single most talked about non-problem in the game... - remove the cloaked from local; free intel is the real problem, not ""afk"" cloaking -"
9/21/2011,"what all this talk about 'winning'? are you all born in the 90s? constant evasion is fine. constant potential cyno is just an unfair advantage. don't get me wrong. i love afk cloaking myself. but i'm happy to play psi war with my prey by popping in and out of local just to see them flee. if my proposal is implemented that is. presently always being in local is boring and encourages me to afk. of course i can still replicate this effect by zipping around safe points, but not afk. that being said i'd much rather the current system than some cloak fuel or other cloak gimp."
9/21/2011,"not sure your reading my post or someone elses, how do i know if someone is there or not? i dont. not sure what the 'answering' in local bit is all about, doesnt seem tot refer to my post.hypocritical? no, i dont think so, im just agreeing that everything should be counterable in some way and you should not be able to affect someones play while you are 20 miles from your pc.if ccp nerf local, well it becomes irrelevent, afk cloaking will end, becasue there will be no reason for it, the psychological warfare element will be gone.what i am saying is that if you are afk for long periods, during that period you shouldnt be able to affect what other people do."
9/21/2011,"the part you're failing to grasp is that the only way they affect what other people do is if you let them affect you.you know what's really fun? seeing someone in your wormhole, catching their name and adding it to your contacts and having no idea if they've left your hole or are waiting around hoping for a kill. no local at all to see if they're in your system. we had a stealth bomber hang around like that for a few days... the trick is to not let them keep you from doing what you do but to simply prepare better. you tank a little more, you watch dscan and your overview a little more intently. when running pi, you don't pull up to the planet and park, you come out of warp, immediately initiate warp to the next customs office then you grab/swap your materials out while your ship aligns.local has made you weak and your arguments reflect that. 'i can see him! he's spooky! he might kill me while he's afk! waa!"" grow a pair and counter him. you can easily sneak into a neighboring system to do whatever. you can alter your ship to give you survivability. you can be alert, use dscan, use the ability to have multiple overview tabs, use your friends and allies to work together with.cowboy up son. the universe doesn't give a crap if you die or not."
9/21/2011,this tbqh.if you people can't figure that out...you have no business throwing a bloody fit in the first place.enjoy local while it lasts wimps... because its going to go straight to hell when its gone.you haven't experienced sheer paranoia until you've lived in whs long enough to know what its like to argue with yourself if someone is really there or not.================ stop the evemail spam!
9/21/2011,"i echo my proposal again, ( which really is a local fix that happens to ""fix"" aft cloaks too)all ships off your grid disappears from local after 15min of inactivity. use of modules (not cloak) make you show up again.forces people to toughen up, and adds new cloak tactics. decloak and show up on local to freak out the locals. also enforces that you be at the keyboard to engage in this psychological offensive. blissfully ignorant ratters get to live in their fantasy worlds until you show up with a cyno. or not. everyone's interests are served."
9/21/2011,"bleh, mine's better. 1. when you cloak, you disappear from local.2. when you cloak, you also lose access to local.... you cannot use local for intel gathering and would be required to more actively do so.3. when you uncloak, there's a 30 or 60 second delay in being able to light a cyno, preventing abuse of the ""disappeared from local"" to hot drop fleets completely unaware."
9/21/2011,"close, but your #2 gimps cloaking as used for legitimate intel gathering. the other 50% of the reasons why people cloak. and your #1 would make for weird cases where you can see a ship on grid but it's not in local.my point of having any ship go off local once afk wasn't decided randomly. it's intended to allow for the benefit of the doubt so that people would not be able to identify cloakers in system by their blinking in and out of local all the time. currently any red in system is also not similarity instantly identifiable. if victims knew that the red is a cloaker, then once he pops up in local again, victims will expect a cyno, and prepare or flee, taking away completely the whole tactical surprise advantage of covert ops all together. the primary 50% of the reason why people fly cloakers. so we can agree to disagree which one is better, but why don't we let the public decide which is the least disruptive to all parties yet makes everyone happy"
9/21/2011,"(2) balances is and makes cloaking more strategic. as a counter to being invisible in the systems (think current wormholes), you'd also be responsible for actively gathering your intel. you could be cloaked off a gate, for example, and have some friends at other points and no one would have any idea you're there.(1) ... if you're cloaked you're not visible on the grid anyhow. when you uncloak, you reappear on local and can use local once again. (3) bring balance. if you're cloaked but in local, they know you're there. the stupid will get caught, the cowardly will stay docked and the smart will have the means to try to survive should you attack. with the delay on the cyno it's a balance for your invisibility from the system while cloaked. the stupid will still get caught, likely they weren't paying attention anyhow. the cowardly will crap themselves then likely get caught or get away... depends on how you fit your ship. the smart will still likely have a good chance to get away, only they'll be doing so to get a change of underwear."
9/21/2011,this. this hard.
9/21/2011,"sorry, i should have been more clear, what i meant was for the *cloaker*, you would have people in visual, but not on local. this seriously gimps cloakers, besides being weird. making notes of who comes in and out of systems is a big part of being a covert ops pilot, and a fully intended function of cloaking. this would take that away, or make it much harder, restricting covert ops to only do visual intelligence gathering.your #3 i can accept, but i think that having all afkers go off local is a more general fix to local, keeps cloakers more or less anonymous, and why gimp legitamate cloakers even more? it really is just the ""afk for days with an alt for the sole purpose of putting ratters on edge"" which is the complaint here."
9/21/2011,bump fo loving.
9/21/2011,"making a certain ship cost a little more to run is not really viable on ""the blobs"" look at how much isk's etc say pl get for their contracts they can afford it only people you would be hurting are the small alliances that don't have the huge logistical backbone that some of the bigger alliances havenerfing supercaps is stupid all that ends up happening is you change the flavor of the month instead of having a large blob of 40 sc's you will have a blob of 300 dreads as more people can afford to use em your not fixing the blob your shifting what they are using make titans and super caps more expensive instead of a sc 14 bil to make why not 60 and make a titan 200 yeah pl / goons / drf will still be able to afford them but they will be able to afford less of them and maybe use them less as loosing 10 in a battle will hurt any wallet"
9/21/2011,"the original balance for titans was there cost ccp didn't think people would make tons of them trying to balance them, by adding more cost will not do jack to balance them"
9/21/2011,"so your idea of a solution is to make supercaps much less fun to own, but leave them just as overpowered in combat as they are? yeah, you might want to think that one through a bit furtherthe problems people have with supercap proliferation aren't related to them using insufficient ice products what good does it do me that a titan pilot has to jf a few extra gscs of whatever? what i care about is how effective his titan is vs subcaps punishing people for owning supercaps does not equate to a useful game balance change"
9/21/2011,the only real solution to super-caps is obvious.mega-caps.

9/22/2011,"on the topic of having a permanent number associated with a character -- i can see the appeal, one could even call it a pilot<U+FFFD>s cerification number for the role playing community (and even change <U+FFFD>born on<U+FFFD> to <U+FFFD>licensed on<U+FFFD>). i dunno about some of those nefarious aspects listed, but for now i<U+FFFD>ll add it to the 'debated feature' list"
9/22/2011,"remember, when posting on forums it is essential to actually read the topic <U+FFFD> otherwise you might sound like the person quoted above"
9/22/2011,"i apologize if this sounds rude, but assuming you are aware that the current valid reasons to have one's name corrected by a petition and gm intervention is for inappropriate content and/or capitalization<U+FFFD> then you<U+FFFD>re supporting a restricted form of name change where, essentially, only if they add a third word, fix a typo, or add a punctuation it<U+FFFD>s ok?"
9/22/2011,"what you've written is a variation of the 'debated feature' ""character transfer"" currently listed as: i wouldn't mind adding another 'and/or' to that......but if you're going to bring reality into the argument then you must consider that name changes are allowed in reality...'sins<U+FFFD> are already <U+FFFD>branded<U+FFFD> via the aka feature -- in fact, what you're proposing almost infringe on the ""sins are born by the toon not the player"" by passing the 'sins' on to a new owner-player. it<U+FFFD>s as flawed and superfluous as your use of the term <U+FFFD>sins<U+FFFD> instead of <U+FFFD>reputation<U+FFFD>; your propagandizing has clouded the possibility that a good <U+FFFD>reputation<U+FFFD> may be used nefariously as well. i don<U+FFFD>t mind either way -- both prove the feasibility of name changing"
9/22/2011,"i has a better idea, why not let ccp give every actively paying player only 1 chance to rename their characters. (some exaggeration intended), tbh i'd like to change my name but at the same don't want to. for that same reason that i don't want to change it should remain in what the original statement about making a character name should be permanent. if you bought your characters or made a change in decision... i say to you all make a new character with that name."
9/22/2011,"once ccp allowed the transfer of characters, the whole concept of your name being your reputation became obsolete. +1 like to this thread.a big thumbs down to the idea of the character name reverting to original upon transfer - serves no purpose and could devalue the character. no, ""jno"" is not a typo name a shrub after me. something prickly and hard to eradicate."
9/22/2011,"paulize, so you agree with me in principle yet you still feel the need to reiterate and pontificate. i'm beginning to think you care more about 'winning' in this forum than the actual proposal here. to answer your single point in your response worth answering: a bad or good rep staying with the toon affecting the buyer of the toon is exactly what we want. remember you too think character transfers are bad. ( am i'm not one to repeat arguments already stated for the sake of it ) buyers need to do research on the toon they are about to buy and make a choice on it. no doubt the rep will affect the price. and please. you know full well what i mean when i used the term 'sins' and we both know full well it could go both ways. please don't patronize me nor the intelligent readers of this forum buy harping on semantics. we are all adults here. :) well most of us anyway. ( people who spell like a fonics robot i'm looking at you )"
9/22/2011,"and to the person (katie frost) who quoted the number of likes as circumstantial evidence of the importance of this proposal. you should be aware of the skewed sample space here. only people who want a name change will vote like. people who don't need one won't even read this thread, as the affected population is a small minority of the eve population. compare this to a proposal that will boost hybrids or gimp cloaking. you will get less likes for those threads because the topic is divisive, and 'not likes' are not counted, and many will be on the fence. but no one needs convincing that these other proposals are a lot more important to all citizens of new eden than name changing."
9/22/2011,"that is from the rules in the character bazaar forum. your 'sins' are kept even if you change your name. that is what negative sec status is for, kill rights, and with the proper implementation of this feature you can find out if the character was a thief. i think this would add to the flavor of tracking down a thief, they want to change their name to avoid being tracked down. it seems like it is pretty easy do to irl, so why not in eve? another possible feature, rather than an aka tab why not require an agent lookup that can say this character has gone by these names in the past? adds flavor and rp value."

9/22/2011,i'd like to bring the idea back up for consideration by the devs..i woud like to propose to ccp that the hundred million or so dead/dormant trial accounts that have never been activated since trial end from the last 7 years be deleted and the names contained therin released for new players/characters. namespace and server space will be released...the whole eve community has known for years....we need names!!!ccp can simply send an email giving them notice (like the emails we all get inviting us back after 6 months of not playing) and then terminating the accounts after the given time. my proposal is for dormant trial accounts only. if a player has activated then in all fairness they should be able to keep name and character for any future use.thoughts?.original thread
9/22/2011,"i agree with this all. additional i wanna make a quick note that the covert ships in general (bl;ops, covert ops, recon- etc) also have less e.hp then their counter parts (t1/t2/faction) so in respect they should by technical terms be more lighter/faster. so i'd like to ask on the note that their max velocity & agility(or even reduced sig radius) be changed a fair % to make up for that loss of e.hp."
9/22/2011,"imo- blackops have enough dps- blackops don't need cov ops cloak, cloak speed is good enough- blackops could use no scan res penalty bonus- could use larger fuel bay just to make it more desirable to fly around, it should be still good idea to just fly through gates to save fuel. however as it currently is, it's not really encouraging to even undock with these ships. main idea here is that if you go in ""deep"" 0.0 20-30 jumps from nearest station you can dock you really need that fuel. it's too much to assume you have haulers alts with you for everything.- fitting stats on these ships are truely horrible, they need better tank and capacitor whatevs. you should be able to fit tank at least comparable to tier 1 battleship. they shouldn't become cloaking gankmachines tho, but i think size and speed and battleship class scan res should take care of it quite much. :/"
9/22/2011,"expanding on some of the ideas presented here:- they definitely need to have at least as good a tank as their t1 counterpart. no amount of bonuses will be compelling if they're too fragile to be put into action.- i love the idea of a ship maintenance array. i'd take it another step and make it large enough to hold a single frigate, allowing one pilot to swap between a bomber and a covops as needed. this makes a small blops gang a lot more versatile and gives another reason to put a black ops ship in the field.- negate the scan res penalty of fitting a cloak. this might be done just by giving the ship a scan res bonus, making a non-cloaky one useful in its ability to rapidly target smaller ships.- fuel/range changes sound good, but definitely need careful consideration to avoid overpowering the ship."
9/22/2011,"currently i always have 2 windows, the overview and the people & positions window opened, because the context menu is not clear enought to manage many positions.would be possible somehow to add custom positions to the overview, so i'm able to warp to them and always have the positions created for the current system in the overview?or is there already some switch to enable this and i missed it the whole time i'm playing eve? :)"
9/22/2011,"are you talking about putting bookmarks on the overview?i'd like the ability to put them on the overview and as icons in space...basically the same behavior as beacons. this is part of the ""we're in spaceships that fly faster than light, why don't we have this ability?"" set."
9/22/2011,"my apologies if i'm not grasping something... how can the cloaker have anyone on visual but not in local? oh wait, i get it now. heh... had to type it for it to sink in. ok, let's think wormholes... this is an everyday thing. we see bad guys visually and there is basically no local. that's how we do our intel... find 'em, fly in cloaked, look at them. get names, sneak in to a good place to provide a warp in for allies. trust me, there's nothing odd about it. what's odd for me is seeing all these people in local (when i'm back in empire) and having no idea where they are, but that's because i'm used to it not being there. believe me, cloaking isn't gimped at all without local around. it awakens the hunter in you. ship on dscan... ok, where. check for combat sites, what type of ship does dscan show, check known wormholes if you suspect they're open. throw out combats out of dscan range. the very thought of local ever appearing in wormholes (not that that's an issue) would effectively ruin a huge positive of them.having cloaked vessels disappear from and not have access to local would ultimately enhance cloaking by making covops, for example, much more interactive. you'd have to work a little more for intel, no more so than in wormholes already, plus you could maintain a true element of surprise that the label ""covops"" implies. you'd really need to spend some significant time without local to truly appreciate the beauty of it's absence."
9/22/2011,"adjust probes a little too. there sits a fix to intel gathering -and- knowing when someone is active in the system. probing cloaked is common so it wouldn't ""gut"" intel abilities if the probes gave back the right types of information.ps: as to wormholes and no local. unless you'd be willing to drop a gate to your wormhole, that anyone can find with the click of a button... unless you would be willing to allow cynos to be lit in there so others can jump in... don't bring the ""we have no local"" out.every last k-space system has fixed paths to them which can easily be seen. k-space residents do not have the ability to collapse an unwanted door to there systems and cycle it else where.the style of play in eve from within wormholes is radically different in more ways than just having no local and to inflict this portion of your life on the rest - i'd say your portion should also change so you have a ""fixed address"" that can be invaded, just like theirs can be invaded. the above would pretty close to destroy wormhole life in eve - it's also about as harmful to game play as gutting local without what it provides for those who do have fixed addresses that all others can easily find and fly to.no - wormhole life isn't easy but it sure as hell has some facets to it that make it workable. don't mix & match across space without being willing to live under the same threats across the board and your ""we have no local"" is well offset by some other things that you can do to protect yourself - things k-space residents don't have."
9/22/2011,"having random unknown ""gates"" suddenly appear in your system without any warning is no picnic either. depending what you're doing, the first time you have a clue the enemy is there is when they decloak and show up on the overview. so yeah, they're different. but, having cloaked vessels disappear from and be unable to use local adds a little mix of 'em, a little spice to empire life that we experience on a daily basis. it's balanced, more interactive and better reflects what cloaking should be."
9/22/2011,"the immediate disappearance from local of a cloaker imbalances the status quo in my opinion. when coming up with a solution to a problem its usually best to just address it in a way that changes the least amount of other factors.currently, a cloaker enjoys anonymity. they cannot be distinguished from other people in a system, as they are just all in local. as you well know, knowledge is worth a lot in eve. making cloakers immediately disappear from local when they cloak will make them easily distinguishable from others. (thanks to the mwd cloak procedure when entering systems.)having everyone disappear from local after a timeout maintains the anonymity that cloakers now enjoy."
9/22/2011,"it doesn't imbalance it in my opinion, it rebalances it. keep in mind, the status quo is what people are complaining about with regards to ""afk cloakers"". with the immediate removal of the cloaker when cloaking from local, and the immediate inaccessibility of local to the cloaked ships, there's a balance still. it's different than what we're used to in k-space, true, but still a balance. the added ""power"" you get with the added anonymity come with an added cost, but then again, it's still ""less"" of a cost than you get simply jumping into w-space. you can always uncloak and reaccess local. you can always learn to watch local a little stronger for people that seem to blink in and out to get an idea if there's indeed a cloaked vessel in system. yes, it would require a little adaption from both perspectives, but again it's less of an adaption than if you jump through a wormhole. a little rebalancing would be a good thing (again, my opinion). you'd have a more active intel gathering requirement while cloaked. you'd have the anonymity of being truly cloaked, not simply invisible but seen.it makes me wonder if we posted a thread in general comparing the two ideas how well they'd be received..."

9/23/2011,"what use is that, when the ship has moved 50km away by the time you arrive on grid? you get to interrupt their bonuses for a few seconds while they reposition to a new grid, but then you have to probe them down again and warp to their new location.keep warping, little interceptor. you'll catch that fleet booster, if the enemy doesn't lay a trap for you first.in starcraft there is a unit called the arbiter which cloaks all nearby units. the catch is that the arbiter itself can't be cloaked. so it's a powerful unit, but it has a vulnerability. then there's the siege tank which can hit units far away with a very powerful attack, but to use that attack the siege tank must commit to remaining stationary for at least three seconds (time to deploy, fire a shot, then withdraw). for every ability, there is a vulnerability: this is called game balance.in the case of off-grid boosters, the vulnerability is being probed down. but you have a counter for that which is to be moving quickly and warp off-grid when someone arrives on-grid with you. your links will deactivate, but only for a few moments. if they persist, you will know what they are flying. if the attacker is flying a cloaky ship they will not be able to catch you while cloaked.when it comes to on-grid boosters, there is always the option of using grid-fu to stretch the grid in such a way that you can safely boost from hundreds of km away.now certainly, information warfare and the command ships which support it aren't particularly popular. there are ships with bonuses to repairs which would probably be better off with bonuses to resists (same tank. more ehp), but those are issues that can be addressed at the same time (or even prior to) removing the ability to fleet boost from off-grid."
9/23/2011,"yes you can have both, but it should required bringing more pastry chefs to the party .. :)pretty sure ccp classified deliberate grid manipulation as ""undesirable"" (ie. exploitive, you will be gm smacked). messes up the database or something .. way old blurp so won't try to find it, so don't ask :)"
9/23/2011,anchoring objects off-grid from a pos in order to force the grid around the pos to be smaller (and thus forcing all ships to be well within range of the pos guns) was declared an exploit. no other grid-fu was declared exploitative that i'm aware of.
9/23/2011,"i agree with the proposal, ships giving bonuses should be on grid.i agree.considering t3s should never have overshadowed fleet command ships, that's not a bad thing."

9/23/2011,i got a better idea that ccp might like that wont totally **** off ppl who log in after 3-7 years of in-activeness to find no characters on their account. in most mmo's when characters are merged to a new server free character name changes are given to players who's names would be taken. why don't we just apply a similar concept and simply clear inactive character names and give them random generated serial numbers. once the person starts his account again upon logging in will be notified that player has lost his name and must rename his character before logging in. simple. lets not go around deleting ppls ****.

9/24/2011,"i don't mind name changes, though i agree that there would be pros and cons in the absence of name history depending on how much control players wish they could have.i think that having name changes should be possible, and that name change history should be optional during the name change process. after all, not everyone is running away from other people/harassment/their pasts. currently, i imagine that criminally inclined players can have many untainted accounts, plus have the option to purchase untainted yet well-trained characters, thereby having ways to do their worst under fresh personas. if this is what goes on, playing under an untraceable, new identity is already a part of eve.the idea of putting name changes on a very long timer is okay.with the way eve works, i don't think there is a way to stop players who want to be underhanded. this is the universe of celebrity justice with no jails. as a fairly new player, i try to figure things out and have fun, and don't truly trust anyone since they all might turn into sharks. it's quite an unusual experience.the fact that criminal type players would probably take to name changes like ducks to water can either be seen as increasing the amount of challenge in the game, or as a nightmare depending on one's opinion.in eve online, safety is a myth. in other mmos i could feel secure, but not in this one. eve online is meant to be hazardous, so i don't support making it too warm and fuzzy. i came because of incarna adverts, and because it's dangerous here.figuring out past character history would make more sense in my opinion, if it was because of applying a new ""private investigation"" skillset, and if it was pricey to do. that would make more sense, rather than making character history an easybutton.cheers,sapph"
9/24/2011,"this just occurred to me: most criminals love their reputation. they want to be recognized and feared. those who don't are already quite adept at changing characters on a regular basis, either by biomassing and remaking alts or buying new toons. try to change the name of a -10 pirate or famous scammer and they'll refuse. their names give them power.mostly i just don't want to get stuck with an alt with a bad or non-sensical name from the bazaar because it was all i could find with the skills i was looking for."

9/24/2011,"drat, then i'm stuck at the ""being a ****"" because if we keep throwing that term around i think we're all going to sound like idiots"
9/24/2011,thank you for your rational and well-thought post amidst all the chaos
9/24/2011,"there's a nice idea; not only make it possible, but incorporate it into gameplay. private investigation is one suggestion but people could think up others as well. so that your new name is your new name, you do indeed get the relief of being a new ""person"". however people can still look up your history with the appropriate services/skills/isk.you could also consider a feature that allows the name-changee to decide how difficult it would be for others to unveil his/her history, with a fixed limit so that it isn't possible to make it impossible - only a stronger deterrant. you can really play with this; even involving concord agents or some such thing.this extends to the idea of making it impossible for other players to reach that history at all without the changee's permission. this simply means that when a player with a changed name is entering some high-value situation, the other parties can simply give him the choice: reveal your past identities or leave. more shenanigans can then ensue.or combine both of those ideas.i like it. this requires that all characters do at least have something accessible by all, that reveals simply *if* their name was ever changed.i do believe history should never be truly impossible to view. and i believe people who petition for a change for reasons of semantics should be free of all this and simply get a straightforward change, as things are currently. i support this old idea even more now because it is something very important to many people, and can be incorporated into the game in quite a good, role-playing way. it would be a win win."
9/24/2011,"i agree completely with this (even though i've never had issues with unavailable names). only so long as the activated accounts aren't even touched. i've been inactive for 1-2 year increments during my time as an eve player, and having my account deleted, or even having to rename my player, would not make me happy.+1 for the idea, ma'am."
9/24/2011,"i absolutely disagree with you. low-sec is still within the sov of one of the 4 nations and so crimes commited there by pirates should still carry the possibility of being punished. i believe the general idea of this was that even as vast as the nation's navies and police forces may be, they simply don't stretch or get funding enough to fend for all of the low sec areas, so they simply don't do it. instead, they have this new option to chose a much easier and potentially profitabl option for the players. concord opens itself up more to players and allows them to go after outlaws which now have a concord bounty on their head. additionally, any player who had destroyed an innocent person's ship or esspecially podded them, is now flagged when in low sec for a concord warrent and may be dispatched, but not podded (as opposed to how outlaws would be treated) within a certain time limit (let's say a week or two). after that time, they can no longer be blown up due to that particular crime, but if they commit a certain amount in a specific amount of time, their security status goes down at a higher rate based on the crimes and estimated value of damages, and of course, also the regular ways sec status goes down.this may sound like a carebear's method of trying to make low sec safe and more like high sec, but quite the contrary, there will always be pirates and raiders in low sec. this idea and general and what i've said here i feel are simply means with which to give even more profit to players and more career options, while at the same time criminals might finally have t o pay for what they do to the average players. you still will run the chance of getting your ship blown to bits if you go below 0.5, but at least you know that there's people you can actually count on to try and do something about it."
9/24/2011,"low sec is most dangerous place for piratesbeing under -5 sec is great risk like having gcc at gates or stations, counting out ship maintenance bay / rr exploiting.what low sec needs is not safety or more risk for people who actually have balls to aggro someone.i could agree with more severe sec hits everywhere but then everyone would just pvp in 0.0 or suicide gank in hi sec and sec rat in 0.0... so...low sec used to be somewhat viable place for catching logistic transports to 0.0 but since ccp gave them near immunity to everything (jump bridges, jump freighters, covert ops haulers, blackops, titan bridge, general rage logoffski, web warp) go figure why no one hangs around in low sec anymore. not to mention that missioning and plexing in low sec became less good plan. doing anything at low sec belts has been pretty useless like forever."
9/24/2011,there's plenty of room for piracy in 0.0 no? why make it safer for pirates in losec? there's plenty of piracy there ..... doesn't seem in danger of being wiped out at all .... and since when do gate guns bother losec pirates - they sit and tank them all day ...

9/25/2011,"usage of containers are such a pain.eg. freight containers:if you somehow use them and drop them inside a pos in you cannot take stuff inside and bring them back. they are such a pain because somehow too big for a normal industrial. they are pretty much useless and a waste of time to get rid of them.once you jettison them, almost unable to take back into the cargohold.i dont want describe all circumstances but try to work with them with a jump freighter, its ridicolous how stupid it is to work with them.also you cannot put small containers into big containers to sort stuff.you cant rename them inside pos.the list of what you cannot do with containers but what you expect is longer then the list of what you can.please check this out and try to fix it.thank you !"
9/25/2011,"i like the idea, but as has been mentioned before in the thread, it shouldn't be so one-sided. gcc beacons following pirates through warp makes life really easy for the prospective bounty-hunters... and thus, should probably not exist unless they've done a lot to 'lock-down' the system and make it 'safe'. at lower levels of 'security', it'd probably just be fine to have gcc beacons lighting up at the location the criminal was at when he committed the crime, only updating with each new criminal act; that way, vigilantes have somewhere to start, but still might have to do a little work to track down their targets, especially if the guys show a little caution and have safespots in-system.as for the rest of it, i'd be inclined to reference that 'corruption' idea the mittani had back when, though that strays a little beyond the point of the thread. my point here is, that if the vigilantes can set up shop in a system, doing things to make it safer for travellers and honest folk, the pirates should be able to do the same thing, setting up shop in a system to make it more dangerous for the lawmen and more appealing to outlaws."
9/25/2011,"the idea of pirates being able to take (a similar level) of control actually makes sense when you say it like that .... so you could have some systems ""under the influence"" of pirates, others ""under the influence"" of ""deputies"" .... i know a lot of ppl who would love to participate in ""faction warfare - like"" experiences, but who don't want to have to sacrifice balanced standings or go into ""total war"" mode to do so .... seems like one key to making this work, is to make it somehow easier to get into and get out of .... i.e.-would be nice if your corp could easily take a weekend and play a pickup game of ""deputies and pirates"" in the nearby losec area, without having to ruin their high security standings, and for those of us that care (nrds, near-nrds, etc.), without having to ""go rogue"" and become pirates (basically killing all targets you see) as current losec roams really push you to do."

(almost half-price between $20 and $30).it certainly doesn't mean i think ccp was right to use their pricing scheme, just noting real clothes can and will cost about as much if you want good, sturdy attire that actually will last you, instead of cheap threads that cost $5 apiece and may well fall apart within a year or so.i don't think you realize that these still qualify as military advantages- faster mining cycles would give those who buy them the ability to claim resources faster for their corp or alliance to then make ships faster to fight their wars with bolstered supplies. faster high-sec travel would allow a combat force to move into position far easier through empire space, breaking warfare in new and unusual ways.in eve, everything is ultimately military or pvp (even mining, industry, and trade), whether you realize it or not."

9/27/2011,"thanks for offering your thoughts on this. good question. let<U+FFFD>s say i am in a frigate and running a minor plex. 3 enemies come in frigates. let<U+FFFD>s say that is too much for me to fight. i have several options: 1) see if anyone from my militia is near and can help. 2) move over a system and open another minor plex. now if all 3 come to fight me i can go back to the original plex. if they keep chasing me then i am effectively tying up 3 of their pilots all on my own! if they only send 1 or 2 after me so one can stay and run the original plex i may fight them. 3) i can hop in a cruiser or assault frigate and run a medium plex. now depending on what they have handy, we may have our fight. same thing would apply if i am in a medium plex and they come with 3 cruisers. if i have plenty of ships that are fit out then i can get in a smaller/bigger ship and run a minor/major plex. depending on how well they have their logistics i may get a fight. the idea would be that if they run me off my plex they would have to run a longer timer out (based on the fact that i ran the timer out somewhat) but by doing that they would get a somewhat higher reward. plus don't forget my militia would also know i entered the plex too. so i may have some friendlies randomly roll in. i'm sure you have seen this plenty of times (even without the notification system) and what great/crazy fights this can create. i would kill or chase off your alts and run the plexes myself. your alts would just be doing me a favor in finding plexes.well if they are better at pvp then they will deserve to win. but again, the idea is that there will be lots of plexes running throughout the fw regions. so if they are just blobbing i would do what i describe above.make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
9/27/2011,i haven't heard any objections so far. i think this idea needs more visibility.
9/27/2011,"i thought this would not only be really funny but would also make sense. concord should also jail the pod of an offending pirate after they destroy the ship. this pod would be in a stasis period of 48 hours where no game functions such as chat, market, and so on would work. they float in station in a pod and can't do anything except pod themselves to get out. this jail would also play the ""banana phone"" song over and over."
9/27/2011,i'm going to pirate you now
9/27/2011,go for it.
9/27/2011,"this thread is now about going for it.i went for it last night but got shot down. so i cried myself to sleep while clinging to my hello kitty island adventure online blanket and sucking my thumb.on a related note:next to the tag as favorite button at the top of each thread, can we possibly add an ignore as stupid button?thanks."
9/27/2011,youd think people would have somethign better to do than to post these foolish and obvious troll threads.yes...going to block now.================ stop the evemail spam!
9/27/2011,"drake, just chill bro. just fire back with a counter like.....the victim trains 50% slower for 48 hours due to stress of getting his/her/it's **** pushed in.just roll with it."
9/27/2011,"counterproposal: people who run military missions for an empire faction should be valid war targets to members of the opposing faction's milita. this would be really funny and make sense. i mean if you shoot at military ships, that's an act of war, right? their captains quarters should also play ""in the navy"" over and over."
9/27/2011,"somebody needs to learn what ""trolling"" is.this is a legitimate post...this is a troll...there is a difference."
9/27/2011,i think that would actually be interesting. brings a whole new level to missioning and pvp in empire.
9/27/2011,"if....and thats a pretty big iiiffff......one can get away from concord after doing something bad in high sec.....then we can start to discuss the punishments.until then, no"
9/27/2011,"no, i think he is actually going to give you some loving."
9/27/2011,"as someone who engages in lowsec piracy, i support this idea. anything that would make lowsec a bit safer and allow anti-pirate types to have some real effect means more targets for me to play with and more pew pew. if only deputies can see someone's gcc then there is already a bit of a balancing factor to this, as anyone in system who is not a deputy would not have any notice of a gcc event. not really a big boon for the pirates, but it's something.besides, being a warpable beacon won't help the locals catch you. just keep warping around the system until your gcc wears off. i imagine that activating a cloaking device would cause the beacon to disappear? what about wormholes? if i can't dock or jump i should still be able to pop through a wormhole.what about allowing a pirate corporation to take control of these beacons? then what? ovo"
9/27/2011,i didn't see the part with slower sentry guns in the op.if they slow sentry guns are we going to see insta-locking thrashers/stilletoes on every gate catching frigates long enough for a second point then warping off?make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
9/27/2011,+1everything's air droppable at least once.
9/27/2011,"don't think it was. it would probably take 3 posts to put all the information together at this point. as people bring up balance concerns i've taken that into account and suggested changes or additions.that's one of those balance things to consider during development.i'd see that as being a valid strat...if the pirates can prevent a fleet from taking over the concord outpost and beefing up the gate guns, they should get the benefit of being able to catch and kill most targets they find."
9/27/2011,"so, what's the problem...?is it the afk cloakers that are causing these issues? is it cloaking or is it just afk in general?having people disappear from local when they cloak will not help as you don't know if they logged off or just cloaked up. if i wanted to ""play"" with your mind i could then do 2 things: log off or cloak which would effectively remove me from local on both occasions thus rendering the argument that i'm in a ""cloaky"" obsolete. i could cloak up a number of times and then just log off for the rest of the day/night thus making you more paranoid, thinking i have cloaked, am still in your system and ready to hot drop a fleet on you at any moment while all along i'm running incursions on an alt making money 40 jumps away. if, however, the afk issue itself is addressed than we might be on the right track. if you go afk for more than lets say 30 mins you get logged off automagically (that is not a typo, i did that on purpose). this would remove you from local and make you guys who are paranoid about cloakys appearing off your starboard bow a little less paranoid, would it not? oh, no it wouldn't, because the ones that are still there in local....well, they might not be afk after all.....the same could go for stations also seeing as i could have my corp/alliance all log in and sit in a station all day while being afk thus giving you the impression that it's not a good idea to hang around due to the fact that you might get blobbed by all us afk'ers.however, setting an auto logout for being afk will effect all you afk miners out there and we can't have that now can we...my opinion is play cautiously, if you don't want to risk it then don't be out there. expect the unexpected as it will happen and when it does just be ready to gtfo as fast as possible. if that won't work...bring some back up or even better: have your clone up to date!"
9/27/2011,i like the ideas in this thread. pi needs more work defiantly to turn it into a full profession.
9/27/2011,"while ccp has a priorty list that may or may not (most likely, and sadly, not) include pi feature enhancements, a feature update that provides a 'time to completion' of the installed program(s) on the extractor(s), as well as current storage capacity would be very handy.it's very similar to everything else we currently have from industry activities via the s&i window, to the market to our character skill sheet.all of which converge to meet the goal of getting pi done quickly so you can buy more spaceships!"
9/27/2011,"supported!what i'd like to see on that tab.you open the tab, same as now, with a list of every planet.single click a planet, and underneath it will list every installation there is on the planet.installations will list the followig:- extractor heads: number of heads, what it's extracting, extractor time, and current total amount.- storage facilities/spaceports: amount of space left in them, possibly add the ability to click on these and get another expanded overview of what's in there.- industrial facilities: what they are manufacturing, time till next batch is complated. optionally, add the stores of the products needed for the manufacture and howmuch of what is available in them.- command center: level, cpu/grid in use/left, howmuch m3 storage is left, expandable with a list of whata is in there like a storage facility."
9/27/2011,"while not trying to change the topic, i see no need to post a completely new thread either - a thought comes to mind:some featurettes that are associated with this topic should also be considered.linking pi to the contract system: (such as) - the ability to buy and sell colonies (this idea should be vetted in light of dust 514)- the ability to contract (ie courier and item exchange) items directly from the customs office hangarand lastly the ability to operate corporate pi colonies which would be linked to the corporate roles system in the same way as they are with pos's.in my opinion this would go a long way to fully integrating planetary interface into eve online, and place it on par with the other industry professions,"
9/27/2011,"naga tokiba wrote:supported.on the pi tab i would like to see: whats being extracted, whats being produced weather extractors are running or not. additionally, there should be an option to re-initiate an already set cycle time (program) from the s&i window. once a planet site is set, there should be no reason to be forced into to ""planet view"" unless the site itself needs to be modified. i have five accounts and all have alts dedicated to pi. all accounts are paid for by my production. there is no reason for a ""simple"" restart to take nearly 2 hours when a single button can ""restart current program"" and have all five accounts done in 15 minutes."
9/27/2011,"with the corporate involvement in pi, the customs office needs to have at least 2 tabs for storage, one for me and one for the corp. i can then keep a portion and also give a portion to my corp which will give access to any approved individual to make a pickup.corporate access and interaction to pi is a must, especially with the coming dust 514. as it stands now, pi is a one person project, meaning that if i create a site, nobody in the eve universe can touch it. once dust 514 comes in, these sites with then be under fire, which will ultimately mean me against the universe. the corp/alliance will need to know when it comes under fire as a pos does and be able to defend it accordingly.the last potential connection is to allow corp-mates access to your site(s) for any reason (i.e. on vacation, waiting on bail hearing, etc.)the last two points will take a lot of consideration for the mechanics, but with the oncoming dust 514, they will be necessary."

9/28/2011,"t3 are supposed to be more specialised, i think if you want a particular bonus only and want it as strong as possible t3 should be the ship you use, t3 boosting is just the new falcon alt. its a serious amount of bonus you get here. not to mention you can dic nullify it and it makes a great scout too + probes etc. as for unprobability its still ******* hard to scan down a t3 running eccm, and any discusion about cs balancing isnt really the point herei just want the old days of flying the claymore back."
9/28/2011,would support this if it were paired with a rebalancing of the warfare processor subsystems to make them more practical for on-grid use and a reworking of the squishier fleet commands.
9/28/2011,perfectly reasonable.
9/28/2011,supporting this post.
9/28/2011,"i like this proposal.every reason to bring people to populate lowsec is good.however, like others here, i do believe that this is a one-sided proposal.strengthening the 'good side' is a valid idea, filling a missing piece of gameplay in low-sec, but it might as well discourage pirates to actually go fight in those player-secured systems.my point being: could we imagine a system that gives a bit of reward to pirates in those player-secured systems? deputies would gain concord lps for bringing pirates down, so why not give a similar reward to the latter?the system could work as follow:- in unclaimed low-sec systems, pirates could gain tiny lp reward (based on ships, ss difference, etc) with the cartel counterpart of the official empire for kills.- in player-secured low-secs, pirates would get an overall better lp reward, and a special bonus for taking down deputies themselves.from a rp point of view, it would reinforce the idea of low-sec being a buffer area with the null-sec cartel-controlled areas, and also give motives to pirates to fight in those deputies-secured systems...just my 2 isks."
9/28/2011,"i like the idea of pirate lps for killing deputies.if you want to take it a step further and create lowsec-specific pve content, you could have pirate and concord missions where the job requires venturing into enemy-occupied space. again, probably better for ccp to put that sort of detail into it, i'm more interested in creating a new system for small groups to get more action."
9/28/2011,actualy that will not effect afk miners att all depends on timer if you run with bonuses each 10 mins you defently ned to do somting with that char you cant just wait longer.
9/28/2011,eh... this is exactly why it does help.
9/28/2011,"and even more is possible. how about a template system for site creation. eventually, it will be required to relocate a site on a planet. that is if you are a serious in your pi entrepreneurship. site setup involves far too many clicks just to arrange my intentions.these ""templates"" are to be of our own design as to permit our own philosophy on ""what is the correct way of doing things"". there can only be so many structures as permitted by command center limitations. perfect placement to minimize resource usage can be quite a hassle. the template constructor would provide an intuitive grid placement system. blanket assignments for product choices alone would take 1/2 of the time off site setup. the template can do this as it is, in most situations, unlikely a single site will produce multiple products.the need and process of the the extractor head relocation does make sense and i am not sure how to improve that, but the setup of everything else is far to tedious and time consuming. the click-fest of pi has the potential to be a mouse killer all by itself. a template system would make pi a more appealing activity in the eve universe. a benefit for all both on the individual and corporate scale.then there is the potential involvement of dust 514 that will.................."

9/29/2011,"i agree with what you say. there should be some sort of reward for doing plexes. however, nothing in a game ""matters"" except the game itself. what does winning at amateur baseball or chess matter? yet people enjoy those games. the thing is, in order to be good, a game needs to be fun and perhaps even require skills that people for whatever reason value. (athleticism, toughness, intelligence whatever) the main problem with occupancy plexxing is currently the most effective way to run plexes is with pve alts. this tends to make people not value being good at running fw plexes. if being good at running plexes was a better indicator of pvp skill then i think this goal of winning faction war would be more valued and, therefore sought after. people would want to win faction war if winning faction war was an indicator of pvp skill. people who just say they want winning faction war to somehow give them isk or something miss the big picture. isk can only be used in this game. if you have nothing to use the isk for, in game then there is no point in getting it. if you have something worth doing in the game like winning faction war then you have a point to get isk. people who think the reason to win faction war is to get isk are mostly putting the cart before the horse. people often miss this key point so i'll give an example:consider lotteries. lotteries are stupid games. winning requires no skill anyone values, and looking up numbers, in and of itself, is not fun. if the lottery only paid <U+FFFD>game money<U+FFFD> that could be used to buy more lottery tickets and never paid money that could be used for any other purpose no one(or very few) would play the lottery. the only reason people play the lottery is to win real money <U+FFFD> not because it is fun or demonstrates any sort of skill that is valued in the community. well the same principals apply to faction war and eve generally. if the only thing you get is isk that can be used in game but the game itself involves no skills the community values and is not much fun<U+FFFD>i think you can see where this is going. giving people the ability to play a bad game longer will not make it a good game. ccp needs to change the bad game mechanics of fw occupancy to make it fun and involve skills people in this community value. if they just say <U+FFFD>here is a bunch of isk for doing this thing we know is boring and meritless<U+FFFD> they are not improving eve. they need to figure out how to make fw plexxing fun and <U+FFFD>winning fw<U+FFFD> be something players think demonstrates meritorious skills. i think this proposal is a good way to accomplish that.make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
9/29/2011,then i expect to see some sort of results.....
9/29/2011,"interesting, but then i demand the ability to kidnap people in high sec and keep them hostage under the same conditions until they pay their ransom."
9/29/2011,no. concord should biomass them instead.
9/29/2011,"i'm sorry but, how does this allow continued freedom of game-play in which you want to do? the penality for ""pirating"" is already negative security status. in which you must then rat/carebear in order to regain security status. now you are proposing to take away people's game time in which they pay for or at the expense of podding themselves?next you are going to suggest that ""pirates/outlaws"" once reaching -5 security status are banned from high sec for 6 months or some ****."
9/29/2011,"oh noez, someone's suggesting actions have consequences?"
9/29/2011,"locking someone out of the game for engaging in valid gameplay is never an appropriate ""consequence""."
9/29/2011,i support this idea if you sec status go back to 0.0 after punishment.
9/29/2011,"i like the idea, but instead of holding a control bunker or at least in augmentation of it, it should require a pos presence as well.this would ensure that the industry element of a corp is in tact and make eve itself more balanced."
9/29/2011,"this is a good idea... but i would push it farther and make the control bunker a type of pos (or maybe a type of tcu). perhaps require a concord charter as a fuel requirement, and a certain level of corp standings to anchor, and maybe a certain corp sec status to keep it online."
9/29/2011,"the only thing a mandatory pos would ensure is a headache. you're delusional if you think a pos brings about industry. industry may require a few poses, but it doesn't work vice versa.anyways op, i have to say this is a great idea but i have to strongly disagree with the gcc beacons following players. that would just swing the pendulum too far against pirates.you're going to get systems where there are always deputies online and moving beacons would basically make any non-frigate piracy an act of suicide. while confining piracy to frigates seems to make sense, in practice it would be bad gameplay.a general one time beacon at the gcc site would allow pirates to make short work of soft targets, but for anything serious they'd be taking a big risk."
9/29/2011,"fleet up with someone and try to catch them using warp to member. it's not as easy as you think. remember than when you warp to a moving target, you warp to where it is when you click warp, not to where it's going. this will just mean that pirates in concord-controlled systems would have to be willing to run like hell for 15 minutes."
9/29/2011,"... add skillz in science, mechanics, and industry - and then some use of 'reports' and a few other material to then produce a blue print that will create a self deploying command center and installation template - just a cool thought to compliment your idea!"
9/29/2011,"again not trying to get off topic but even within the pi viewer there needs to be an update to the hud...case in point: the home button and close button in the current iteration...there should be a button for each installation type or at the very least the extractors!take for example a gas planet - if you have command center upgrades to lvl v, and your not just doing pi for base or tier i or ii production, then you might be forced to be creative with your extractor placement which will inevitably be away from your command center... so why should any pilot have to hunt for ones extractor simply because its not next to their command center?or when the supply line is stretched half way across the planet and you have to repeatedly drag the cursor to get to the extractor?this is a sorely needed pi hud update!"

9/30/2011,4th link for exhibit_de is broken.
9/30/2011,great idea to help flesh out the pirate side!
9/30/2011,"my problem with afk cloaking?it's killing fleet fights, is currently un-counterable, and its forcing a shift of gameplay that requires you to have a second account if you want to ""peeveepee"" in 0.0what is becoming an ever increasing ""standard"" - is that players should have alt accounts which have a cloakey covops, and covert cyno generator. owner of the player moves the chararacter to system x, his mates, whom also have cloakey alts set them up in system y, z, and a - meaning that over 50% of the constelation has an afk cloakey with covert cyno capabilities.afk cloakey is left to be afk, while the owner focuses on his main character, which is pvping elsewhere, ratting, in a wormhole, basicly doing whatever he/she wants to do at the time.with dualscreens, or simply tabbing to the afk cloakey character at regualr invervals to check local chat, and dscan looking for easy targets. if the people in the system move to another system, no problems, you're mates probably jsut told you as they noticed local spike on their afk cloakey.when a target presents itself, 1 minute later theres 30-50 people in system, their targets dead, and they're allready in warp towards the exit, as they know the path back to their blackops pilot is clear as they have their other afk cloakeys in the next adjacent systems.honestly - what can you do to counter that?how is this a good fight, or fun for anyone other than the turkey laughing manicly as he lights the cyno, and the fleet that jumps in to kill stuff they know they have absolutely no chance of being able to survive, or pick off any of their crew, as they essentialy pick and choose all their fights.how can one counter this without having double their numbers in system 23/7 waiting for them to strike? which is not a viable solution. afk cloaking needs to be looked at unless you want ""fleet fights"" in 0.0 to be replaced in their entirity with blobs, supercapblobs and hotdrops. because at current, why would you go out with 20-50 people roaming around looking for a fight when everyone else just hotdrops onto you, or onto other targets. its too easy, and provides too much safety to the attackers in regards of the people doing it never having too initiate a fight that they are not certain that they will win, even more so if they are operating from a 0.0 npc station, which in effect makes them un-evictable."
9/30/2011,"are you sure you understand what is discussed in this thread or what ""afk"" means, for that matter ?pain is weakness leaving the body"
9/30/2011,"yes, when a player is not actively using the client - or at their computer.again - they're not using the afkcloak for anything other than glancing at the screen every now and then, they're flying around having a blast doing missions etc on another account, therefor the clien that hast the character thats cloaked - is afk and not being used for the mostpart.still applies to the ""they are there but are they realy there"" aspect of afk cloaking - and it seems that for the mostpart of this thread the coupling of the afk cloaker with hotdrops hasnt been discussed."

9/30/2011,"agree that this demonstrates much of what is wrong (or right depending on pov and what type of play you personally are into atm) with 0.0 today ... but separate issue from afk'ing or afk cloaking ....imo, we don't need to nerf 0.0 (a lot of ppl like it the way it is) ... but rather, create new 0.0-like spaces that allow for additional types of game play (i.e.-small homesteader regions / regions where cyno / transport is horribly limited, etc.)."
9/30/2011,"abstract (tl;dr): removing ice from high sec would greatly benefit the eve market in many ways.background:i've traded ice for several years. i've watched market trends, as well as ridden events like today's oxygen isotope run.removing ice from high would cause a very big change in eve, starting with the more obvious, rising iso prices which would directly effect pos fueling costs.less supply in empire would decrease the amount of macro miners in eve. i do not have real statistics, however through empirical data, i've seen many people warp to the belt, cut for a while, and warp off.most of what i've seen is not a group activity, but a solo activity. a solo activity that seems like it would be easy to accomplish with a bot.with rising pos fuel prices, many different markets would be effected.r&d prices would go up (bpc's would increase as well as bpo research) with an increase in bpc prices, t2 prices would also suffer the trickle effect.while supply and demand are always linked, if ice products rise in price, pi would suffer a shortfall.if a corp can not afford iso's, they will also not be purchasing coolant for example. if a corp can not afford the fueling for a tower, they would be less likely to buy a tower, further trickling pi and pi manufacturing.t2 production speculation is a very interesting topic indeed. currently, fuel already costs close to the gross of a c-reaction twin tower setup (complex reaction). further fuel price increases would drive the t2 margin down, cutting supply of lower end reactions. when the lower end reactions suffer a supply shortfall however, it will in fact drive down more valuable moon minerals down as well, technetium should fall, as well as r32-64 mats.once the markets reaches a state of equilibrium, overall t2 production should become profitable again, with the more abundant c-reactions value increasing, where the current bottlenecks value decreasing (ie, silicates go up, tech goes down).please note, i said ice should be removed from high sec, not low sec.lowsec ice abundance would still allow availability for aspiring corps to access. however people whom reap benefits from botting or going afk, would not be able to gain resources as easily.from my mathematical simulations, i would expect iso's to equalize around 900isk-1100isk per, six months to one year after implementation."

9/30/2011,"tl;drships require fuel to warp, industrial and t1 frigs require very little fuel, battleships require lots of fuel.ship fuel proposal (v0.99.1) a. the goal is to: encourage solo and small numbers, equivalently, discourage blobs encourage use of small and t1 ships, equivalently, discourage large and t2 ships the main idea for achieving this is limiting ship travel distance, for combatships. a single solar system can support the daily activities of a limited number ofpilots (exception: mission running hubs), so people tend to spread out, however the easytravel allows the blob to form quickly and go anywhere. i expect making travel hard (forcombat ships) to act as a force, which tends to keep the people spread out - for any givengroup, it would be easier to attack them with small numbers and it would be easier forthem to attack with small numbers - because the blob would be slow and costly to form andmove. the concrete mechanism to achieving these goals is introducing ship fuel. in order to be able to warp: a ship needs a certain amount of fuel per au, stored in a fuel bay, in addition to the capacitor; in the absence of fuel, a ship can still warp, but at a greatly reduced warp speed, something in the ballpark of twenty times slower, so nobody is left stuck in space;shuttles and rookie ships do not require fuel. the fuel bay is separate from the cargo hold. game balance is affected by modifying two variables. one variable is the volume of the fuel bay, which determines the maximum distance a ship can travel without refueling. the guiding principle behind fuel bay volume is that harmless ships travel long distances, dangerous ships travel short distances. second variable is the fuel consumption per au, for each ship class and for each ship within a class, again, harmless ships are cheap to deploy, dangerous ships are costly to deploy.(without picking too much on what is harmless and what is dangerous) taking into account the fuel consumption and fuel bay volume, here are some tentativedistances for different classes of ships, with base distance traveled without refuelingbeing 1000au: t1/t2 industrial ships, (jump) freighters, mining barges, orca, rorqual - 100%, 1000 au covops (not bombers), t1 non-faction frigs and destroyers - 70%, 700 au t1 non-faction cruisers and battlecruisers - 50%, 500 au t2 frigs, faction frigs, t2 destroyers - 33%, 330au force recons and bombers - 25%, 250 au combat recons, hacs, fleet command ships, faction cruisers, heavy interdictors, logistics, strategic cruisers - 15%, 150 au field command ships, battleships - 10%, 100 au numbers are tentative and while the concrete values may decrease, the proportion shouldstay very similar. the goal is for t1 frigs to be able to travel across a region and back,while battleships to be limited to 4-5 average systems without refueling (may needtweaking some systems' radii), harmless ships travel much, dangerous ships travel little.b. nature of the fuel it would be preferable to have an wholly different kind of fuel,rather then reusing ice products, because increasing their demand willaffect negatively other venues. comedy option - npc good, sold onlyfor aur. seriously, probably a new planet commodity would be a goodidea.c. fuel tanker class ship a new class of ships is created under advanced industrial ships - ""tankers"". their roleis to accompany fleets and refuel combat ships. they have a large fuel bay and it ispossible for other ships to refuel from tankers in space. it is not possible to refuelships by any means other than from tanker fuel bays and personal or corporate stationhangars, specifically it is not possible to refuel a ship from any ship cargo hold ornon-tanker fuel bay. two new ships are created for each races - blockade runner tanker and deep space tanker,based on the existing transport ship hulls, with the cargo hold bonus changed to fuel baybonus. the base fuel bay volume is subject to game balance, with the goal for a single blockaderunner tanker to be able to increase the effective range of a 3-4 cruiser hulls to thenext class and a single deep space tanker to be able to increase the effective range of3-4 battleship hulls to the next class (bs class range to hac class range, t1 cruiserrange to t1 frig range).d. related skillsthe fuel consimption is affected by the skill warp drive operation, which is modified byadding to its description: ""each skill level reduces the fuel needed for initiating warp by 5%.""that's all for now.ps. naturally, there are also jump bridges and cyno jump mechanics, which also will be scaled down drastically. this will be amended in a following version of the proposal.pain is weakness leaving the body"
9/30/2011,"you do realise there are plenty of systems that you'd be making it impossible to cross in anything bigger than a frigate, right? i dread to think what would happen if you actually wanted to use a bs or a cap in actual combat with this frankly awful proposal. are you trying to make it completely and totally impossible to function away from empire? how exactly would this encourage small gangs? when you can cover maybe a dozen systems (round trip) with a hac gang, maybe twenty at a push in bcs, you'd kill small gangs completely. it'd be impossible to actually go anywhere without multiple tanker pilots, and who the hell wants to fly a slow lumbering unarmed and paper thin hauler when everyone else in the gang is in a hac?this idea is awful in every conceivable way, would make it virtually impossible to actually fight, and actually taking sov just wouldn't happen. ever again.trolling removed. zymurgist"
9/30/2011,great idea. lets kill roaming gangs all together. and if someone feels bold enough to even bring out battleship lets limit his jumps by fuel.maybe leave faction warfare and go have some real pvp?????? maybe?
9/30/2011,"there are tons of systems in eve 100 au's across, and several on the order of 250 au's. imagine trying to move a fleet of 20 bs's across a 200 au system now.... everyone drops out of warp at different locations due to slightly different quantities of fuel.... .then a hauler has to warp to each ship, and drop fuel so they can warp again. and it might require multiple refuels... to get across one system. this proposal basically makes titan bridges and jump bridges teh only effective means to move a conventional fleet. i'm sorry, but you really need to go back to the drawing board, because this suggestion is game-breaking bad!"
9/30/2011,"yes. that's why i have written that some system sizes would need to be changed. no, i am not. what in the proposal would make it impossible to function away from empire?this is written in the proposal. people's activities make them spread naturally across systems. it would be slower for people to concentrate in a big blob. this applies both for attacking and defense.you would be able to cover more systems with t1 frigates and cruisers. you may maintain strategically positioned fuel depots.i think you haven't read carefully the proposal and don't understand it and its implications well. yes, there are some weak points, that i'm thinking about, but you didn't seem to notice them.please, try to be constructive. you're not scoring anything on the forums.pain is weakness leaving the body"
9/30/2011,"yes, that's why i have written that some system radii would need to be changed. do you see any significant issues, which may arise if some systems are made smaller?ps. i have also written, that in the absence of fuel a ship can still warp, but at a greatly reduced speed. in fact, the warp drive may operate in two modes (switchable via right click menu, hotkey, etc) - one fast, consuming fuel and one very very slow, consuming only capacitor. yes, if they stay in their current form. that's why i have written that their range need to be drastically shortened.pain is weakness leaving the body"
9/30/2011,"as we all know low sec is empty, lacking content and so on.sure we have fw blobs, pirates camping and roaming. incursions are ran there sometimes but not fequantly because hey there is hs.what this is about is adding more content to low sec.over the past few years we have seen improvements for hs, 0.0 and so on.the only major change they made was that bses will spawn in some ls systems. wow wee not compared to all the love hs has been getting and low sec.cpp should add more content to low sec.such as 1.) having pirate missions in ls. these missions would not be located in a station they would be an agent in space. this will allow ganking of people at the agents who are rolling missions. the lp scale will make the null sec ones still better than these lowsec ones. this would not be anything major because all the coding for agents in space is all ready there and mission data is all ready there.2.) fw improvements a. having controll of a system would give bounses to that faction for running lets say a complex that would yeild faction drops at the end. it would be a complex that would spawn randomly in system owned a faction. it would have an officer npc of lets say gall fed. it has the chance of dropping faction mods. these would not be soled and would have a few rooms. like other faction warfare sites they would have a beacon people could warp in on. so pirates and other people can come in. milita memebers would be able to see these on their map in their rejoin as a hostile attack of an opossing faction on their teritory. it would take about 5-10 people to do them. a. maybe incorparate some sleeper ai3.) sytems bounses for pirates a. pirates would have the ability via acivity as of killing other plays and a system of ship point vaule would remain in the system. so the system where fw lp points that base the ships mods,type,scale to award the corperation with bounses. these bounes could do the followinga. sentery guns do less damage a volleyc. while in a system with a booster upgrade it reduces the negitve effects of the boosterd. system bonuses would not be listed on the map etc. this would also help a pirate group of getting a larger bigger bad group into this x system they do most of their activity. ofc the bonuses would go down over time and there could be other factors of loosing these points. one could just be straight up loosing ships in that system."
