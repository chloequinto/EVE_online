9/3/2013,"it's simple <U+FFFD> shut down blink **lmao**. and make this an in-game mechanic. i am not a gambler but many of my friends play blink. why not 'rent a casino office' out of a number of limited slots in stations. or introduce a new capital ship called cruise ship or casino ship (reinforced with strontium like a pos etc to avoid a nasty attack).surely ccp could find a legal justification to turn gambling to their advantage, and out of the hands of 3rd parties?"
9/3/2013,"now, this is just a thought and while i expect a little flaming for this, it's a legit question too. there are a few common facts that can be pointed out:1. concord does a good job killing the people that attack or attempt to kill you wronfully.2. suicide ganking is a great way to make isk.3. suicide ganking is in and of itself generally disliked by the community of carebears, which i suppose is reasonable by itself.but just a thought...how much of an impact on eve would it have if concord not only took military action against transgressors, but also took repair action in an attempt to protect the innocent?it's probably just a silly idea, but i just wanted to throw it out there anyways. if it sounds legit, seems like an interesting thought. if not, oh well who cares. generally my idea is that most gate campers and suicide gankers are fairly low in experience and are just looking for something to kill and/or a way to earn isk. granted, there are quite a few experienced pvpers who gate camp and suicide gank as well, i mean, why not? it's certainly not illegal, and the reprocussions you get for doing so are justified. but from my understanding, if you want to learn pvp, invite someone to a duel, toss a can out, do it one on one, go into low-sec and get into a fleet and have some real battles. i tend to find blog gate camping and suicide ganking in or near high sec to be kind of petty.the real fights, wars, where eve lives and thrives, is in null-sec.but really though, why is it concord has all this amazing military strength but doesn't seem to give a crap about repairing anyone?just a thought :) call me crazy if you wanna. :)-maalar"
9/3/2013,"with the recent changes to command ships, much love was spread around. the nighthawk was brought up to par with its compatriots in the damage-dealing arena, but its tank is still little better than a drake's when fit for small gang combat (read: fit with a prop mod and warp disruptor/scrambler) thanks to only having 5 mids. as such, i propose the following: add a 6th midslot by removing a low. this will make the nighthawk more generally viable in pvp instead of limiting it to just fleet roles where tackle isn't required."
9/3/2013,"i knew it, as soon as ccp put this in place to satisfy the whiny bitches, they came back and complained that it is not enough."
9/3/2013,"after playing with new scanning interface a bit, i've became a little dissapointed. no, signatures which don't dissapear when out of probe's scanning range are great. but new custom formations are pretty useless in theirs current state, because despite you can split your probes into 2 groups of 4 (which by the wiki is enough to scan anything), you still can't move them as two separate groups. and this means no one will care about this ability as moving probes one at a time is highly uneffective. simply moving all 8 of them sequentially from one signature to another will be much more faster. aside from that, there is one other thing which make the scanning process quite tedious (and wrist-hurting ) job. this is because its totally based on mouse controls, which is worst thing one can face when doing highly repetitive, based on simple, common patterns, task for hours. so, what exactly should be changed:1) hotkeys for every scanning action are needed. those include: initiating the scanning process, gathering your probes, changing formations, switching between 2 splited formations (see below), positioning of each formation (its very inconvinient to drag and drop it, and prone to missclicking when you accidentally drag it for arrow's point). new positioning hotkey should work as this: immideatly reposition currently selected formation to the mouse cursor's position in the same plane.2) as stated above, ability to split probes in two individual, independent formations.3) some way to estimate probe's disposition also is needed. currently its often hard to tell how much below/above the plane where signature being scanned are your probes are situated, until you've rotated camera a bit to check it from other angles. something similar to tactical overlay (in combat) would be of great help here."

9/4/2013,plus 1. it does get rather annoying.
9/4/2013,"i represent a community of the best explorers in one of the only exploration corps in eve, along with all our friends. many of us are old regulars in the exploration chat channel and now hang out in the booty tiki bar post odyssey. i get to hear the same issues brought up over and over.the elephant in the room: odyssey did not make exploration more interesting, profitable, or more fun. the hacking mini-game and pinata style scatter container mechanic in profession sites is both hated and enjoyed, but ultimately these mechanics do not have much of an effect on the game.the greatest changes in odyssey that effect exploration the most are:a. scanning is much easier and the trained skills for scanning are far less relevantandb. the removal of npc rats from profession sites (data and relic) in all space with the exception of wormhole space and drone regions.profession sitesodyssey saw a flood of new explorers running profession sites for about three weeks. this caused all the materials from those sites to crash on the market and continue to crash months later. finally some of those items have begun to level off in price, but since so many people are sitting on the items until prices go back up, it is unlikely they will ever be restored with the current state of the game.this means that where explorers previously were able to get 5-20 mil from a highsec radar site pre-odyssey, are now lucky to get 2 million from said site in highsec. comparatively in lowsec magnetometric sites (now called relic sites) used to occasionally give 50 to 100 million isk, but those items have crashed as well.in this 6-month price history chart is a typical decryptor found in data sites - notice the alarming crash starting in june:[img]"
9/4/2013,"i second this. taking the rats out of profession sites i believe was a huge mistake. yes it encouraged people to get out and explore but it also made the items that come from profession sites over saturated on the market. making scanning easier is a double edged sword as well. i couldnt tell you how many dead ships i have seen in ded 4/10's from rookie pilots with absolutely no idea with what they are doing.last night i found a dead deimos in an angel 4/10. it used to be you had to have skills to cherry pick scanning and now anybody can do it. even at low skills you can launch probes and start your scan at 8au and get whatever it is at 100% within a few sweeps. with 1.1 the red dots staying on the screen even while scanning down another site,all you have to do is move the probes over at 2au or so and you'll get it. odyssey was touted as an expansion to exploration but really it was just a dumbing down,wrapped in bubble wrap and delivered in a shiny package."
9/4/2013,+1 these are very positive proposals that would greatly enhance exploration. sorry ccp but what you created was a detriment to exploring and needs to be changed.
9/4/2013,this is exactly what is wrong with exploration since odessey was implented. ccp took away the ability to make isk in high sec with the changes for relic and data sites. i used to run these sites in the past with the chance of making good isk from them. now they aren't even enticing because of the low return. also with the new skills it makes it easy for new pilots to find the sites but they are unable to run them. changes need to be made to enhance all skill levels.
9/4/2013,"this has come up when we come across a completely new player who wants to get into exploration. and it is hard for them to do anything other than profession sites which no longer pay what they used to (mining could pay more now). they have to 'wait' a pretty good while to competently run the ded 3/10's and 4/10's; no complaints about that when profession sites were worth running until they could get their combat skills up, but now it isn't the case."
9/4/2013,"you've got my +1 for this. in fact, it should be implemented this way:1) scanning has some newbie-friendly casual interface to assist begginers in climbing learning cue - exactly as it has currently.2) one can only scan very simple highsec sites with least expensive loot in them while using it.3) if you've became dissatisfied with what you get in those, you can switch off casual interface and start to become accustomed to more challenging manual controls. this will be enough to scan any site until you are staying in highscecs (but not without some mental workout)4) while you are hitting lowsec/null space, not that you are have to use this complex manual controls now, but the riddle you have to solve to successfully scan the site becomes even more complex. sometimes you will have to accept, that you current skill level and equipment you are using won't enough to scan it at all, despite all the effort.as for rats, i adhere to the suggestion above that they are should only spawn after unsuccessfull hacking attempt, in all sites except for those for total newbies."

9/4/2013,"there is zero chance that ccp will deploy this content before star citizen does, ccp is going to sit tight and count their initial player losses when citizen goes lie next year. they will let citizen lead the way while stemming what losses they can and look for areas what fans hate and design their products around that.would you rather cross a mine field first or follow in some one's foot steps?"
9/4/2013,"because it isn't their responsibility and/or they don't care?seriously... why would they care about the lives of immortal demi-gods (however ""innocent"" they may seem) and their dime a dozen crew? life isn't exactly a precious or a scarce resource in the universe of eve.plus, no matter how non-violent the activities you partake in, you contribute in some way to someone else's war machine... including those that are a potential threat to the empires themselves.okay... enough rp stuff.why should people's safety be increased in high-sec more than it is? convince me (using an argument other than ""i don't like it""). otherwise, it's fine as is."

9/4/2013,"i do find that assertion funny and rather silly, but it makes clear why you posted such a bad idea.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
9/4/2013,and...what is the proposal here?
9/4/2013,"for concord not only to act as punisher, but also as logistics for the great unwashed.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
9/4/2013,"as a dedicated carebear with knowledge of null/low securities, i don't like this idea. eve is not a pve or a pvp game - it's a market game, and as such, the pvpers take care of the balance of power. you should thank them for helping the gristmill of the economic engine run.i cannot support this idea. while i don't like the activity of pvp, high-sec is already too safe. the only thing i would support is that concord takes action against criminals, maybe by increasing their response times where the perpetrator is of low security status, or attacking those deep enough outright.remember to thank the suicide ganker next time for keeping the wheels of commerce running smoothly. i've been ganked before too (and lost over 10b isk), but that's eve for ya, and isk faucets aren't too hard to come by. play smarter with tanking and repping on your industrial - especially now with the revised industrial ships."
9/4/2013,"as a nighthawk pilot that solo's 7/10 and 8/10's i agree. i need an extra. slot so i can fit a ab to reduce my gate transit time while i lol semi afk through this plex. there is zero chance you'll get an extra mid slot, i'm dealing tengu/cnr damage while sig tanking like a boss and applying dps to frigs with my precesion heavies unlike the cnr and to some extent the tengu which must orbit out of range to survive.why are you trying to fly a pve or pvp support hull as heavy dps & tackle?"
9/4/2013,"would you say that the sleipnir is a ""support hull""? what about the astarte or absolution? are those also support only? personally, my kill record with the sleipnir and absolution (i've never flown an astarte) would say otherwise, but your mileage may vary.the simple fact is that the nighthawk is lacking in something the other command ships are fully capable of: the ability to tackle in pvp without making itself a loot pi<U+FFFD>ata."

9/5/2013,plus 1 from me....
9/5/2013,from context i assume he means players in npc corps
9/5/2013,i don't feel making it easier to exclude dust mercs would be helpful for the (hopefully) growing integration between games.
9/5/2013,"while i feel that 10% tax on high-sec pi is bad enough if it were accurate, i feel that it's worse that the ""10% tax"" is actually closer to a 15-20% tax.example: consumer electronics cost 900 isk to export which means the assumed value is 9000 isk per unit. in reality, consumer electronics are valued around 4000-6000 a unit, which essentially means we are paying 900 isk per 5000 isk of value (18%).while many suggest making the high sec tax rate lower, i'd like to suggest keeping the tax rate the same but having the value of the goods being imported and exported actually updated daily. use the global average as the taxable amount and tax rates will actually be appropriate to the goods."
9/5/2013,the problem is that we told ccp this kind of thing would happen back when they first imposed these really high taxes on pi goods aaaaand they ignored us.
9/5/2013,let's hope they quit ignoring us then? ;)
9/5/2013,"+1 i agree with this, things need to change to make exploration a viable profession to skill into anymore. ever since i started exploration drone regions were useless. when this expansion came out i was certian they would distribue the loot evenly atleast"
9/5/2013,"if ccp intends to make exploration in general an important part of the game, then they should act that way. it should be challenging and rewarding. i don't mind the hacking minigame per se or the spawn hunt that follows, but it is a bit annoying. it might be fun for new players.what i really mind, and why i give an enthusiastic +1 to max's suggetions regarding rewards, is that the rewards seem to have been heavily nerfed. spawns from all the combat sites are meh after the patch (highsec). they are barely interesting to even new players, unless one spends an inordinate amount of time scanning and running sites.if exploration drops are a way of controlling the economy, allowing ccp to adjust cash flow into the economy, why not come out and admit it? if not, why not give exploration its due?exploration should be a legitimate eve profession with high rewards for training skills and developing strategies. if ccp agrees with this, it should act that way. if it does not, then please let them say so and we can get on with our gaming knowing exploration is, at best, a sidelight.thanks again to max for his time, and i hope ccp, through the council's input, responds appropriately and with due diligence."

9/6/2013,"um, most of the stuff we get from sites are sold to other players, so there is no cash 'flowing' into the economy, it is just changing hands. only the overseer effects, bounties and blue loot in wspace are isk fountains as far as i am aware.i am not convinced of this. it might be a factor, but surely not the reason. i'm more thinking of more supply by easier scanning (and people were soo afraid to lose their dsps...) coupled with other factors like the one you mentioned and sellout of stacks.otherwise i a with you. my two main gripes are that _every_ person now sees signatures - imo you should at least be in a ship that _intends_ to probe - and the no rats weirdness that are profession sites now. i can sort of see the relation of more salvage from relic sites to the new capital rigs, but as far as data sites go there is only more supply, not more demand."
9/6/2013,"keep middle mouse button pressed, move mouse, ship turns in the desired direction.i know about ship agility, i know some ships would turn very slow. right now, if i want to do the exact same thing (turn the ship in some random direction) i use double click. not easy to use and not feeling like i control the ship. the method i propose would give make the space battles feel more real, and we could better feel the ship's mass when trying to turn.it's one of the first things i tried to do in the game when i downloaded a trial - turn my ship. it was 50% of the fun of a ""spaceship game"". after that - i gave up and did not play for 1 year because the game felt too complex and - i could not even ""fly"" my ship. so - right now, manual turn is possible using double click. please make it possible using the mouse. see the ""i was there"" video, imagine doing that with double clicks. i mean - yes, people do that, using the spiral approach to dodge fire, but with double clicks it's not as immersive."
9/6/2013,"1. i really don't care. completely honestly, i don't give a crap. it was an idea and i could honestly care less of the outcome.2. obviously you didn't understand the purpose of the proposal. you would still duel, can flip, and war dec. it just brings to question why concord would blast away the bad guy and let you perish. if you're going to take any good-sameritan action, then why not repair ships being wrongfully attacked?it is a thought-provoking idea. however, either way, i don't care. i just wanted to put it out there. take it as you will."
9/6/2013,"i agree.however...no offense, but your post is kind of bad. you claim the nighthawk needs another mid, but you don't elaborate on why. a lot of us posted a lot of good information in the command ships thread about exactly why the nighthawk needs another mid--why don't you pull some of that into your post?here, i'll start.compare the nighthawk to the other shield tanking missile cs, the claymore. let's look at a couple sample solo/very small gang (1-5 people, total) fits for the nighthawk and claymore. looking at the hull bonuses, the nighthawk's designed for a buffer fit, while the claymore would excel with a booster or asb. we'll play to those strengths.even if we don't use a web (which, imo, you really kind of need for a ham pvp setup in order to deal full damage), we still need a mwd and scram, which leaves 3 midslots for tank on the nh and 4 on the claymore.sample nighthawk fit. basic and simple, probably the starting point for nh pvp fits:[nighthawk, pvp]damage control iinanofiber internal structure iiballistic control system iiballistic control system iiballistic control system iifaint epsilon warp scrambler iexperimental 10mn microwarpdrive iadaptive invulnerability field iiem ward field iilarge shield extender iiheavy assault missile launcher ii, caldari navy scourge heavy assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii, caldari navy scourge heavy assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii, caldari navy scourge heavy assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii, caldari navy scourge heavy assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii, caldari navy scourge heavy assault missile[empty high slot][empty high slot]medium core defense field extender imedium core defense field extender iwarrior ii x5you've got 164.5 cpu and 461 pg left over for those two high slots, which is more than enough for two medium neuts, a couple links, or a large shield transmitter + large capacitor transmitter for spider tanking.including drones, this does 733dps with cn scourge, 555 dps with cn non-scourge, 846 with scourge rage, 637 with non-scourge rage.tank is 93,417 ehp, with average damage reduction of 5.534x (useful to know for spider tanking).speed is 1097m/s, signature is 340m (no mwd) or 1996m (with mwd).cap is an impressive 6m31s even with mwd running.however, there's not much room for customization with this fit--you can't add much more gank, and you can't add much more tank without dropping your tackle.seems decent. now let's look at a basic claymore xlasb fit:[claymore, pvp xlasb]ballistic control system iiballistic control system iico-processor iidamage control iifaint epsilon warp scrambler iexperimental 10mn microwarpdrive iadaptive invulnerability field iiadaptive invulnerability field iix-large ancillary shield booster, navy cap booster 400shield boost amplifier iiheavy assault missile launcher ii, caldari navy mjolnir heavy assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii, caldari navy mjolnir heavy assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii, caldari navy mjolnir heavy assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii, caldari navy mjolnir heavy assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii, caldari navy mjolnir heavy assault missile[empty high slot][empty high slot]medium anti-kinetic screen reinforcer imedium anti-explosive screen reinforcer iwarrior ii x5hammerhead ii x5fitting's a lot tighter--only ~3 cpu and 208.5 pg left over for those two high slots. that's enough for a medium neut and not much else, with either implants or dropping something to metas.how does this perform compared to the nighthawk?627dps with cn, 709 with rage (no missile type limitation like the nighthawk)tank, after 9 charges of the xlasb, is 156042 ehp, with average damage reduction of 5.657speed is 1351m/s, sig is 263m without mwd, 1545 withcap is still good at 5m 6s with mwd on.so you're left with a ship that's got significantly more tank, not much less dps, smaller sig, significantly faster, and easier for logi to rep...and there's plenty of room to move things around to customize. drop the dc for a bcs to get a lot closer to nh damage levels while staying well above nh tank. main problem is that you can't make use of your utility highs without implants."

9/8/2013,"i did a search and didn't find a serious proposal for this or any notion of a comment on it, but i'm sure it's a general assumption that this would be a really great inclusion to eve.i know eve stands with the ""no more than 24 hours skill training"" rule. that's alright, but what about skill planning? it's obviously a huge part of eve online, just about anyone and everyone is recommended to get evemon and eve fitting-tool or evehq. it almost bears to question....why don't we already have this? it seems almost like an obvious item that should be in eve and shouldn't take too much to implement.i for one don't like the idea of third-party tools. the more software you add to the computer the more vulnerable it can get. while they work nicely, i'd prefer to trust only one software vendor and not three or four. on top of that, it reduces the fullscreen functionality. i like to not have to tab out of eve unless i really want to.so:'evemon' in-game or a good variation thereof is a proposal.a fitting tool is a proposal as well. being able to build fits in-game without having to actually buy the materials and/or the ship just to see the stats should be an in-game functionality. in addition, the ability to make multiple plans for skills or to develop automat skill plans based on your current skills and the items requested would be an excellent entry.overall:propose to include in-game skill planning, fitting tool with any ship and any module even if you do not own the item quite yet.thank you!"

9/9/2013,"there are a lot of players that seek solo pvp, and it's not so easy to findhow to encourage solo pvp? my ideas:- multiply the ransom if a pirate player is killed with no help- increase the chance to drop modules if another ship is killed with no help- add a ""honor"" rating that can be selected in overview, it increases with every solo kill or loss ""honorable"" players can see each other and maybe fight - monthly or weekly tournaments organized by ccp - kept very simple: sign up in game with a npc agent (for roleplay), there is a system selected by ccp where scanning does not work, be there at the time, there are no stations and the system is closed once the tournament begins, nobody can bring more than 1 ship (any ship - so a merlin can get paired with a vindicator, this keeps the randomness of real solo pvp), then a ccp person has a giant list, and teleports the players in pairs of 2 to various places inside the system, with a timer of 10 minutes (?), then all pods get teleported out of the system (if there are draws, they can fight again with other opponents if they were not able to kill anything in 10 minutes), then repeat until 1 remains the system will be closed to prevent others joining, but players would be able to get out if they want/can, decide they don't want to lose the ship, they just lose the place in the tournament 2000 participants means - 11 ten minute fights to get to 1, that's 110 minutes + 30 for organizing, that's something like 2 hoursyes - it would not be fair for new players with cheap ships (same as random solo pvp), i just tried to make it simple, so maybe it will be implemented, if the ccp would want to get complicated, and use ship categories, it would be ok with me winners get nothing except what they loot- (edit) maybe winners get standing with the npc agent corp, that is a new corp, same as other npc corp with agents and missions, but players can gain lp and standings with every solo fight they get intoalso ccp could broadcast the most interesting fights and get some publicity the tournament could also use teams of 2, 310 (?), with the same rules (everything allowed, win or lose), for more interesting fights if there are too many who sign up - maybe more systems, to accommodate them or a lottery but, if it turns up these tournaments are popular, why not create the conditions for themmaybe even automate them like some barbarian war games that take place in no man's land i know for sure i would be participatingplayers who run from their opponents by exiting the system - would find themselves on the gates in the nearby systems, where the cheering crowd will welcome them :)"
9/9/2013,"balance of ships for 1v1,will not be required because players can use all ships, and people will just use the best and because eve is so complex there will never be a best shipmaybe it will be somehow automated like a battleground in wow, rewards being - the loot from the enemies and standings towards the npc corp players would talk to the agent, join as 1 or as a team of - 110 with the option of fighting a team of 110 if i join as 1 and accept fighting 23, my problem maybe even selecting the class of shipsthen they get to the system where the tournament takes place ccp offers no help for players to travel once inside they find themselves in a safe, and are teleported to another safe when there is another team (suitable, with as many opponents as selected) or lone enemy ready to fight if after a battle the team loses a few members - they will be paired with a smaller team, and so on these fights would go on forever, with no final winner pods would be encouraged to exit the system by npc hunting them, and the inability to place bookmarks there would be an exit to a low sec system, so pods don't end up dead when exitingthe tournament systems would have no station, same as nearby systems after losing al ships, - players exit the system then they can come back maybe after a delay"
9/9/2013,"solo pvp is already perfect it never was about gaining isk and i hope it never will be besides that if one decides to solo, that chances are he/she will looses more that gainsas a solo pvper i don't wanna be marked by anything, also i don't want other solo pvpers to be marked i sort of don't want to know whats coming this would actually damage solo pvp as it is, giving it some kind of template you get this honourable, almost arranged 1v1 fights in a lot in fw and in rvbthe tournament would only work if it's ship class restricted, and that would be quite boring to watch unless people would bring golems and vindicators to compete which would never happen, because the price is so low i can get a better price by running fw sites and having honourable pvp all day everyday with t1 frigatesdon't touch mah sandbox !"
9/9/2013,"ok, forget the mark the tournament would not exist for making isk, and people will join for fun are you saying that people will not seek fun in this game, only isk? they will bring what they have, what they can afford to lose to have fun fun being - 1v1 or 3v3, with whatever class of ships they use and whatever class of opponents they select there will be no survivors - if running away, the gates at exit will surely be camped and there would be a lot of fighting outside, between people trying to get to the tournamentif you want blob - it's easy to obtain, outside of the tournament if you want solo pvp it's not easy to obtain you can obtain it using my idea, and this does not mean you are a carebear maybe you are ""elite pvp"" and select - ""i fight with my frigate against 3 opponents of any kind"" the tournament does not make it easy, it just provides you with fast fightsfrom a roleplay point of view - it's easy to imagine a pirate corp creating this tournament in lawless space ""yes but we should be able to blob the pirate corp, and everyone at the tournament"" then - you should also be able to destroy everything in the game, destroy concord, and so on concord puts limits in the sandbox, the tournament system would just add something, not limit anything"
9/9/2013,"getting these kinds of fights is extremely easy in rvb or in fw why would i need to risk my ship to actually go in this arena system if its camped for sure i'm not getting out of that arena alive so that limits the engagements back to t1 frigates (the same as in fw or rvb), but with added risk of getting smart bombed when jumping into the arena system and most definitely getting ganked when leaving it if you just want to have fun there are already sandbox institutions for that"

9/10/2013,thanks for the support mate. it's appreciated. rally all the denizens of new eden you can. this idea must not be allowed to silently pass into the night.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
9/10/2013,"dear csm,i recently experienced a high-sec gank that i thought was a complete exploit of eve and the material extraction profession (ice and asteroid harvesting). i have read and witnessed gank after gank in high-sec where the typical aggressors are t1, meta 0-1 destroyers piloted by experienced players. how can it be that a corp of very low security status (including its members) can clone jump or pod race to a high sec station, fit a destroyer, undock, warp to a scout at 0 km, and melt down a ship without consequence? yes their ships are either destroyed by concord or they self-destruct (<4m isk). yes their security status is lowered, but now they can increase it again by tag ratting in low/null sec space. their objective is only to destroy ships, disrupt market activity, and generally be a pita. things have gotten so bad recently that it is nearly a fruitless effort to mine or ice. players wanting or needed raw materials need to create a fleet with combat and logistic support. when will the game mechanics change to drastically limit aggression towards high sec barges & exhumers?here are my suggestions:1 - +2 warp core strength to all exhumers2 - increase the resistance bonus from 4% per level to 8% per level (yes make it high for this class of ship)3 - reduce the drone bay to 25 m3 if needed4 - grant a shield boosting bonus of 7.5% per level5 - if 1 thru 5 are not possible, then provide concord and the navy ships with logistics to allow the ship to escape and survive.in short, give the material extraction pilots a fighting chance to flee and save their ship. all bets are off if the barge/exhumer pilot start the aggression... i look forward to your thoughts and those contributing to a better eve."
9/10/2013,"suicide ganking has been around for as long as eve has been in existence. ccp has never classed it as an exploit (by evidence of them never implementing mechanics to outright stop it... even though they do have the ability to do so).that said...- it is not ccp's (or concord's) responsibility to ensure your survival. the onus is on you. high-sec is safer, not safe, relative to low-sec and null-sec.- a few csm members don't see why suicide ganking should be nerfed again.- the automatic consequences of suicide ganking are a 100% of the ganker's ship (with no insurance given) and loss of security status. beyond that, it is up to other players to enact consequences against the offenders. the game can (and should) only do so much for you. again, the onus is on you.hint: use those killrights you have against the ones who maintain positive security status.- people who regularly suicide gank don't even both using tags4sec. last i checked, it takes 200+ million to go from -10 to 0.0... which isn't worth it if you're going to nose dive back down to -10 again.- you already have the ability to defend against suicide ganks. it's called tanking your ship and/or using teamwork. yes... you will mine less and/or hold less ore and/or make less isk per m3 of ore in a ship that has been tanked and is working together with others... this is the tradeoff for increased safety.if you are really paranoid though... and don't want to use teamwork... get a procurer... it was specifically designed to take punishment (65k+ effective hitpoints ftw!).- destruction is good for the eve economy. and any significant disruption of the market is considered a monumental achievement that is to be applauded given its enormous volume."
9/10/2013,"it's just a matter of consequences.the consequences do not match the offense.criminals have free reign of space even after destroying your ship.there is no law even in the highest of empire systems.concord is not a law enforcement even though the wiki says:concord ded divisionthe main responsibility of the ded is to track high-profile criminals. for this they often hire independent contractors (better known as bounty hunters). the ded handles the licenses and legal issues of all bounty hunters for the empires, although some of the empires have been known to bypass the ded in special circumstances. also, the most notorious criminals are marked as free-for-all targets by the ded. =====this doesn't even stop a known criminal from docking.concord won't stop them from blowing up you ship, but they will only blow up thiers.at that point, the can dock buy a new ship and go back at it or go buy tags4sec in low sec or use the ones they brought with them.said negative status should imply a penalty or tax to purchase a new ship or equipment.a fee to undock should also be applied.unless they have used their tags4sec to impove their security status.either way, it will cost them to improve their sec status or fees to buy and try it again.their should be a 30 day wait to biomass said character to prevent bypassing the penatly.that is one consequence idea."
9/10/2013,"but they'd just have an alt buy the ship, undock, eject and let them board it..."

9/10/2013,"sorry, but no"
9/10/2013,"well, then i suggest making all eve null sec, with no npc stations or agents that would be a real sandbox new players would get into a null alliance from the start null alliances would have to compete for getting new players, so they don't get outnumbered it's not like i would enter the tournament to be safe even allow bubbles inside, and no safety for pods if you wantmaybe add an option like selecting which players to be matched against with high priority so you can disturb who you want by constantly appearing as a tournament opponent this - if you can get there there would be escort fleets and fights going on outside, a lot of content from my point of view"
9/10/2013,dude why are you pushing up ideas and have no idea how solo/small scale pvp works some of your sentences even show you don't know how eve itself works maybe try some institution already in existence which support this kind of pvp before creating ridiculous ideas; yes you will get blobbedyes you will get falconized yes you will get bubbledyes you will die a lotyes that's what it's all aboutyes we all love it !your idea proves that you want to build a controlled environment inside a perfectly build sandbox game and try to patch it up with another ridiculous idea when people raise an issue about it the arena will never work because it destroys everything what eve (my precious) as sandbox game stands for

9/10/2013,"esteemed members of the factional warfare community, we all know fw needs help. currently there seem to be nothing but farmers in these fw sites (plexes, colloquially) flying warp stabbed cloaky ships that run at the first hint of trouble from any size gang. plexing is boring, and the name of the game is warfare... so i propose:loyalty point gain should be reworked to provide more points for engaging in combat than capping a plex. obtaining a meager 120 lp for a kill is lame considering capping a medium plex will net you 3500 +/-. this would encourage more players to fit and fly rather than stab and run. secondly, the farmers will plex to the point where the faction lp is not worth as much, and then change to the other side, taking only a 24hour timeframe penalty to join the opposing milita to do it all again. i think that there should be a period where you cant join the opposing side, just like how you cant just ride back into hisec after deciding not to be a pirate anymore. you should have to grind status or something.lastly, system tier bonuses are lame. they should have something to do with the combat or rewarding of lp rather than adjust broker fees and pod prices. thanks for reading."

9/11/2013,ok once again good evening all and to point there are some systems in eve e.g sov space that have only say 1 belt in it so hears a little way i think ccp needs to do to counter this. belt upgrade tire 1 gives to 5 belts for 50 mil a momthbelt upgrade tire 2 gives to +5 belts for 60 mil a momth belt upgrade tire 3 gives to +5 belts for 70 mil a momthi hope you feal the seam why as i do it may evean want more people out in sov knowing that they could alt not only rats and isk amount of the system but to change the belt lay out for extra isk per momth is a win win.
9/11/2013,"suicide ganking is legitimate, intended gameplay. hi-sec is in no way intended to be safe, and no profession should be immune from loss.mining in a hulk is explicitly choosing to increase your gank risk in order to increase your income. use a skiff if you don't want to be bothered. the income will be lower; that's the price you pay for lowering your risk."
9/11/2013,the fact that one or two characters can come come online for only a couple minutes a week and still maintain a war declaration is really quite annoying. i think that the aggressors should have a certain amount of time collectively that any of the members would have to be online for each war week or the war becomes invalidated and costs a lot more to declare war for a week if this happens. larger corps would have to have more time and smaller less. i don't believe this would affect the people who are actively playing this game only those who log in briefly to pay fees or change skills. wars should be able to be fought by both sides and when an aggressor wont come online there is absolutely nothing that the defender can do which would never happen in a war because if a soldier doesn't show they are awol and will be punished.
9/11/2013,"i think i've heard before that fps style control would severely increase bandwith used to the point that people would rage over it, especially during large fleet fights.also, as a sub-warp race veteran and someone that used to be part of a formation flight team in eve, i feel like i'm somewhat of an expert on the subject and i have this to add: i don't really think it would improve immersion. why? because i see my double-clicks as the commands niobe (me) shouts at morpheus (the crew), and the 2 second delay as morpheus (the crew) not keeping up with me."
9/11/2013,"in an ideal world where ccp had infinite dev resources, sure.in this one, no i'd rather see those very finite resources employed in adding new gameplay functionality rather than replicating 3rd party support resources that everyone who uses them is very satisfied with.eve has always had a very large constellation of community-sourced 3rd party resources, and it would be a monumental task for ccp to satisfactorily replicate the functionality of evemon, pyfa, eft, dotlan, the jump planners, eve survival, the isk guide etc, etc."
9/11/2013,making a kill worth more than the cost of the kill is an obvious farming loophole.

9/12/2013,please understand that i am not whining. i am pointing out that there are opportunities to improve the game mechanics like some have posted in this thread. this is about a healthy and constructive dialogue. clearly there are issues when i high sec gate camp near dodi can pop any ship they want (mostly industrials) simply because they want to...

9/12/2013,there are plenty of areas of space (we will call them rural hisec) that are quiet and gankers tend not to go because there are a lot of targets in caldari hisec (lets call that urban hisec) to gank. so why not move out to the country and away from the busy areas that the gankers run around in?
9/12/2013,"my thoughts are that you have plenty at your disposal to be able to mine. it seems that your looking for a way to tip the scales in your favor, and no, i dont think most people will agree with that. so, instead of asking for an entire reworking of industrial ship stats, why not consider other options? just a few:you said your using more than one character. replace one of their mining boost ships with an ecm cruiser. gankers dont have much time to pull off a successful hit before being concorded, so few will wish to attempt to engage a mining barge with a jamming ship on grid.why not mine in lowsec? pirates? work out a deal. i would be willing to let you mine in our system just because it will attract targets to you. (in turn, giving us more people to shoot at) no, it wont guarantee absolute protection, but you would have help from us just for being ""bait"". im sure other systems occupants would be willing to deal as well... isk for mining privlages. i wouldnt bring the orca, though... shyte, you may even be able to pull off finding a low-populated lowsec system and mine in peace, just look at the map and filter kills in last 24 hours. there are many systems out there that arent heavily populated. the intent was never to be able to conduct any profession in this game with no risk, and i think that your suggestions would make mining ships untouchable. but you know, the thing is.... even if ccp did what you asked for... the gankers would find a new way to deal with it. (such as fitting a few ships with many mid slots with nothing but scrams to counter your warp core bonus)."
9/12/2013,we are in the country... lol
9/12/2013,"thank you for your feedback. just to clarify, i suggested changes to barges and exhumers and not other industrials. i think reinstating the +2 warp strength to the skiff is not asking much at all. additionally, i never asked for high-sec or anything to be risk free, nor would i ever suggest it. yes, there is always a counter move to every offensive and defensive move -- such is life. imo, the ecm cruiser would be popped easily along with a barge and most exhumers, but the idea warrants further thought and consideration.it is possible we could work out a deal with material extraction in your system with provided ""protection"". contact me in-game if you would like to discuss this further."
9/12/2013,....because in real life....jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.
9/12/2013,and likewise what happens if the aggressed corp don't log in? do they forfeit all their stuff to the wardeccers?
9/12/2013,"also, did you really just create this character to post this idea?i can understand maybe wanting to avoid extra war decs, but if you really believe in your proposal, man-up!jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
9/12/2013,"i don<U+FFFD>t think that you are wrong to identify the aggressor as a problem but the problem is bigger than a single expected role, in my opinion. in fact renaming many of the terms used in the war system would at least manage expectations <U+FFFD> war could be relabelled <U+FFFD>disappointment<U+FFFD> and the participants <U+FFFD>unlikely to be suicidal corp 1<U+FFFD> and <U+FFFD>unlikely to be suicidal corp 2<U+FFFD> rather than aggressor and defender <U+FFFD> it would reflect what goes on far better than the roles that are stated but rarely fulfilled.a big problem i see with the war system is that it allows for ridiculous ratios, there is nothing a hundred people can do in a war against ten so you don<U+FFFD>t bother trying. war, as far as i have experienced, can not involve everyone that is involved especially if there is ever going to be any fighting. a good mechanic has to be able to involve everyone and the current war system is almost designed to exclude people from the game.why not modify your idea into an additional feet fighting system separate from war that allowed for arranging times and places for fleet fights using a limited number of ships, something along the lines of the alliance tournament. a specific system is assigned for fighting so everyone still has the normality of high sec <U+FFFD> heck, it can be an ultra sec system to save breaking the universe and have concord manage fair play. the fleets can be no larger than the membership of the smallest corporation involved and the victory condition the elimination of the enemy fleet. three fights over a week, winner gets an e-peen extension. the time of the fight, or best match can be derived from the corps members activity so it is known in advance if the two corps time zones match.moving scoring away from isk would also be nice, tactical fighting with the best you can afford rather than the isk based shopping list that is the norm for a high sec fight <U+FFFD> losing the battle but killing the most isk shouldn<U+FFFD>t really be an aim, entertainment should be above accounting.it doesn<U+FFFD>t have to be mutual, just by invitation and recorded somewhere in the corp bio as some form of honour type rating, turning up being as positive a thing as winning.i realise that it would be slightly civilised to simply get on with the fighting in this way but it would serve to open up conflict to all those corps that really don<U+FFFD>t want to waste a week on probably not shooting at anyone.that is not to say that war should be removed but it would need to be adjusted to reflect that you had ganking, duelling and fleet fighting as well as low and null which all in provides a smorgasbord of combat opportunities. currently there are corps that declare war in order to gank freely, they have no interest in fighting and are only in it for the barges. obviously with notice most people know to lock up the ships that these people want to shoot at making it a fairly pointless exercise for all, in many cases.i think the cost of war would have to be increased to a point where you would do it when you only do it when you wanted to take on/out a corporation, to take out its towers etc. our towers have been floating in space poorly defended through countless wars without anyone even bothering to threaten to take them out, let alone actually shooting at them. our <U+FFFD>aggressive<U+FFFD> enemies have always had plenty to shoot at, just not the will or numbers. both corps involved should have assets anchored in high sec space, there should always be something for the other side to shoot at and the victory condition should be destroying those assets or not. the aggressor and defender might even fulfil those roles if they have a reason to. im not suggesting that shooting at towers would be thrilling but it would be a lot more interesting than the 161 hours of nothingness that war seems to currently provide.in addition to that a red vs blue type war should be accessible if wanted but that should be mutual.i appreciate my pop poll is not scientific but the first corp in my current system has 3 kills and no losses after a total of 10 weeks of war <U+FFFD> 1 kill for every 23 days of war they have enjoyed. the next has 1 loss and no kills for 203 days of war, fantastic fun. i know that there are counter examples but in a system with 30 people in it a random one is not to hand, nothing seems to happen in most wars based on where i am. it would be nice to see some ccp statistics on high sec war, what i can read for the corp i<U+FFFD>m in suggests that we lose fewer ships when at war than not, which is scary. that is largely because if we do fight we outnumber the enemy which guarantees the aggressor won<U+FFFD>t come out to play, the rest of the time i guess our members are not as suicidal as the system seems to require them to be.i don<U+FFFD>t know what the perfect answer is but as it stands it seems that removing the war system would entertain more people than retaining it in its current form. i do think that there should be war but it shouldn<U+FFFD>t be a ball and chain that the game has to drag around and i certainly agree that people seem to be wrongly tied to the idea that an aggressor is aggressive."
9/12/2013,"another nerf hi sec thread, surprise surprise. makes me wonder about the op and his skills at ganking. in many of the belts i mine in, i frequently see many afk miners where it wouldnt matter if a ganker shows up red in local and on the overview, their ship is gonna keep on mining (or just sitting there in space because the last rock went pop). its pure laziness if a ganker cant find a nice easy target."
9/12/2013,"i disagree. local only gives you a toon name, and a sec status and corporation if someone takes the time to click on the box. if a ganker does some ratting and gets his sec status up then that becomes useless information. local only becomes a real too lif a, people actually use it. b. if they talk to other players to find out what corporations and toons tend to gank in certain areas. new players start all the time and some will want to gank, and older players can add another alt to the stable, so you always need to co-ordinate with other players to find out who to watch for. even then, someone will always end up being a gankers first victim, and local wont be a help at all."
9/12/2013,"you are missing the context, which was the pilot in question being in sov null sec.high sec has little to no value using local as intel, unless you are under a war dec.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
9/12/2013,point to you. i will out of context myself from this one then.
9/12/2013,"let players own pocos every where. the lower resource amounts in high sec, plus the additional cost and resources required to defend them will take care of things. let the market work, no more ccp price fixing.necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom. it is the argument of tyrants; it is the creed of slaves. - william pitt"
9/12/2013,1
9/12/2013,"i'm a no.1. the more people hanging in stations, lounging in stations, what have you.. in stations is less people in space. shifting kids in the sandbox from the money maker eve online to ""big brother"" eve, which has not been as widely or universally well received as i'm sure ccp would have wanted.2. anything that detracts from eve with the current level of development staff is diversity that appears, at a glance to be unable to be afforded, financially or in focus. a few good patches, and rebalance is nice, relative stability are nice, lets have them keep it that way.you want to walk? adopt a dog, have some kids, find a park."
9/12/2013,"it won't. if it will be implemented with integral delay/cool down timer (like 1-3 secs between key pressed and actual turning initiated) of sort, and will rotate ship on some fixed angle (15-45 degrees per keystroke) each time wasd key pressed, it won't be any different from mouse double clicking in terms of bandwith usage, but much more convinient. it won't be precise also, but in most situations you don't need it to be precise, you just need to turn your ship slightly."
9/12/2013,"to put it simply - it wont work, and eve will never implement it.the game isn't designed to allow this to happen.sorry, but either get used to flying ships as it is at the moment or find another game. (i'm not trying to be mean or troll you, that's just the way it is)jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
9/12/2013,"actually the controls shouldn't move the ship directly. when you use navigation controls it should visually show you a course correction that you then commit to. you use the mouse or keyboard to adjust a vector line, with a highlighted plane showing deviation from current vector. when it's set the way you want you click or press a button and off you go. same bandwidth usage as current double click but better usability.i think fps style controls would be a mistake. these are spaceships, you plot a course and engage."
9/12/2013,"yes, it is. as i've mentioned before, when implemented in right way, there won't be any difference in bandwith usage. i simply don't understand what others mean under ""this game isn't designed for such"" it is really needed and it is not so hard to implement (just another method of conveying the same information to server as with doubleclicking)i beg to differ. combat piloting could be (and should be) done in that way. you won't be always able to plot course in the middle of battle and orders like ""change course 30 degrees starboard"" (pressing wasd key) is perfeclty in place here."
9/12/2013,"rheyne, i think most people here are discussing the idea in the op: continuous control of ship by moving the mouse.if you wish to have feedback on your idea, you may be better of starting your own thread."
9/12/2013,"if we really are having a discussion here, why what i've wrote won't do for objections/additions to model, proposed by topic starter?"
9/12/2013,"well, finally there is an opinion i totally agree with. this used to be a place where social relations meant something. where one's success heavily depended on the integrity of and cooperation within some ingame community he associated himself with. the isboxer shurely makes circumventing social relations part of the game too easy. it makes some tasks, which otherwise would have required many hours of training and teambuilding (like suicide ganking or even doing incursions - yes, there are isboxer gangs succeffully doing even high end pve stuff) too easy to achieve for just one man, who was smart enough to install some software and follow its configuration guide (which means effectively anyone who was able to complete game's tutorial in the first place, even not so smart high schooler can do this). yes, similar funcionality could be achived with some hardware tools, or by running 2-3 alts in parallel sessions (still can be done by one man simply alt-tabing through different windows) but this doesn't mean nothing should be done. you know, security people tend to say ""skillfull burglar can pick almost any lock, but this doesn't mean we have to stop locking the door when going out"". you can't achieve total security, but you shurely can reduce the number of those who successfully bypass restrictions by making things much more challenging for them (and punish them more severe). and keeping this number as low as possible is what this all about."
9/12/2013,"is there any reason ccp cannot reference those programs from within eve? 99% of pc games do not rely on 3rd party programs, so for a new player that is just starting eve the idea of downloading another program to install, setup and run seems ludicrous. looking online for help, that's normal. downloading 3rd party software and setting up api access seems like a scam at first and would not even cross most minds.if my tutorial agent for ship fitting told me about a 'black market' tool to help test fittings i would consider downloading it.if the tutorial showing me the skill queue said "" there are many ways to plan your future, check our www.---.com for more information, i would look into it.eve starts in full screen mode by default, alt tabbing is a nightmare to most. 3rd party apps feels wrong until you comprehend it."

9/13/2013,"dear csm,as you may know the industrial side of eve has been left unattended for a while in every area.can you please use this post to really take note of what people are asking for since ages?even if thus us a small portion of eve, please understand that it is a core aspect of the game together with the market. and acknowledge that changes are needed, the game has evolved.topics that need to be revisited are various and i know that many pilots have come up with very good threads regarding poses, manufacturing management, trading analytics, mining ships evolution....i will not redo them, instead im asking those great pilots to refresh their thoughts here and motivate other carebears to post here.please listen, we are not just a minority...we are part of everoldsfly smart"
9/13/2013,"some beautiful ideas:- mining capital ship t3:hull class orcaname trex6 mining lasersorca cargo capcitydiff modules configuration- pos corp management improvementsadd production slots to each array (massively)add corpies slot rental ui and member hangars- fleet history enhancement for corp mining payoutsthere are several good examples these days that include a fee for each role and mining capabilities of each used ship- improved radar pos array. gives alerts to pilots when neut or red pilots in system, able to configure it with auto warp to pos.- asteroid mining array posonly to use in sov spaceable to mine roids at 30 km distancesilos abilityno defense capabilities"
9/13/2013,i would also add that the ice and ore site scanners be limited to mining ships.let the gankers scan it out or train an alt to fly a mining ship.ship scanners should be:combat sites for combat ships.mining sites for mining ships.
9/13/2013,"i think that all sites should require a scandown, for both parties, like it was before. gives some advantages to both sides. miners have to take time to find the sites (and are thus vulnerable to guys like me looking for you), and as long as your dscan is working, youll see my combat probes long before im able to pin you down."
9/13/2013,"edit: posted draft copy -_-thanks for not taking differing opinion as a personal attack as so many people here do. give the ecm a try.. .trust me... a ganker cant wait for the jam cycle to finish... he has only seconds, and if you hit two in a row, he will be concorded before he can fire two shots. if he is flashy, he may not even get one. ill mail you ingame tonight to discuss terms of you occupying our belts."
9/13/2013,"it's whiners like this that are ruining eve. i mined in the beginning. never got ganked. know why??? i learned how to tank, orbit and use dscan....and yes, i play in highsec. how about you htfu and actually play the game. you have all the tools needed to survive and prosper in this game.use them"
9/13/2013,you know one real issue here is that a people create small corps just to war dec larger alliances in order to take all members out of incursion running... they log in for 1 minute to renew the dec and log out. there is a real abuse of war dec mechanics that needs to be addressed with by ccp!
9/13/2013,seriously.... this is just a bunch of 'noob corp' only alt characters complaining about the war dec system.lets just lock it.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.
9/13/2013,"so i'm surprised this hasn't been brought up yet but hey, why not.i saw that the csm is looking into the recent debacle of tos 'changes' and the every changing attitude and direction of eve to a less risky and more 'safe' style of game. if possible, could the csm give us updates in this or another thread as they come in? specifically, i'd like (if possible) any updates regarding meetings/dialogue with ccp. most importantly, i'd like to know if there is a lack of dialogue or simply regurgitating legal language by ccp to csm requests. i think that would be a rather telling sign of things to come.also, this isn't a complaint or demand about the csm and saying they're not doing enough or something. just an idea/post/thing because clearly this issue isn't going to be dropping anytime soon. so, why not have a place for it outside gd with more focused purpose outside of trolling gd style.good idea? bad idea?...edit: if it's just me feeling this way, feel free to flame away. i'm just testing the waters to get opinions on this beyond the tos problem."
9/13/2013,"this has been going on for several years of csm, why would they start now? clearly csm have no power to turn eve away from its direction of wow in space, even when we managed to get mostly nullsec pilots elected who i'm sure oppose this direction."
9/13/2013,"i don't know. it just seemed to me like a bunch of crap happened one after the other so...i made this thread. like i said, if this is just a phase that happens that 10-year vets have seen before, let me know. i've been here only since '07 so i might not be seeing the trends others are vov."
9/13/2013,"people are beginning to really hear about it and see the effects of it.most of them aren't happy.+1 for what was promised with transparency after incarna.i've never run for csm, but if our current csm can't push for the values of what eve is within its strong mature (even cold) playerbase, i think it's worth a second look as to who is representing us.please push these issues.nine years of staying faithful (2004 player), please don't change the spirit of this game and your company now..."
9/13/2013,"i too support a call for dialogue. i feel this tos is first small stone, setting the groundwork toward a direction that could potentially and fundamentally change eve for the worse. further, i believe that the dialogue on this matter should extend beyond forum posts and should include voice/video casts and that the player base must receive direct answers, not those clouded with ambiguity and legal jargon."
9/13/2013,"also is the csm allowed to update us on this kind of thing live? just curious....hope not :salso also, if enough people post in this thread voicing concerns like mine, can we get a csm statement or plan to address this? a call for ccp to talk to them? something??edit: re: post above mine. same concern here. if a video response series happened, would the dev's be able to actually speak their own mind and such, or would a team of lawyers, ia, and the ea dude be off camera forcing them to spit out canned responses?"
9/13/2013,"+1 from another upset player. the tos changes don't in any way impact my own play style, but i am vehemently against anything that limits the sandbox.additionally, can the csm let us, the very concerned players, know if there is anything more proactive we"
9/13/2013,would love to have the number to internal affairs...
9/13/2013,"i think at this point, even just having the csm or ccp give us an update like ""we will have an official response for you by x date"" then at least we would know its actually being looked at seriously rather than a, if we don't look at it then it can't hurt us, type of mentality."
9/13/2013,"i would just like to clarify my post, i do hate the fact that this game is slowly being ruined by the need to cater to the casual crowd. resent developments have been another big step in that direction for sure, however it is not a new phenomenon.war dec nerfs (repeatedly)concord buffsmining barge buffsthe safety weapons locksuicide insurance nerfthe list goes on with very little movement in the opposite direction. if the csm had the power to stop any of those past changes i'm sure they would, which must lead us to the conclusion that they do not have the power."
9/13/2013,"i support a call for clarity.i support a call for transparency.i'll go even farther, supporting a call to make the tos as clear as water.i can understand some rules having a level of openness, but this must be more the exception than the rule. [quote]the more i know about humans, the more i love animals.[/quote] ain't that right"
9/13/2013,"simply put, stonewalling is damaging to the community.a clarification about the reasons why said changes needs to be made. even if the eve community does not agree with them, there is so much ambiguity in said terms that they could apply to virtually any group.nobody, well, at least not many people, are suggesting that impersonating a ccp employee, gm, or isd should be allowed. it has always been that way.keeping quiet doesnt fix the problem, it never has in eve.perhaps it does in other mmos, where the playerbase is not as vocal, and communication comes down as an absolute law, but given the sheer amount of publicity that ccp has gained from certain scams, which would now be bannable, an explanation, if not a complete rewording is needed.your move ccp, and keep in mind that no response would most likely mean a lot of alt accounts being unsubbed..."
9/13/2013,"my accounts are on a 3-month subscription cycle, and their renewal is pretty well in doubt at this point."
9/13/2013,+1in the same boat.
9/13/2013,my alt runs out in six days unless i plex it. why should i if i can get banned for saying i'm me but on that alt?
9/13/2013,"i was going to make 20 new suicide ganking accounts when my new pc is put together, but i probably won't do that now."
9/13/2013,"about 2 days ago brave newbies camped their inbound gate into their home system a majority of the fleet was orbiting the gate at 10km and dropping cans every so oftenabout a half hour later a gm cyno-ed onto the gate and cyno-ed out, moments later all the cans were deleted let us be clear,we were not dropping cans to cause lagwe were dropping cans to de-cloak covert-opsonly about 60 cans were droppedour dear ceo received a warning that his account would be banned if the conduct continued could this rule be clarified? it's very open ended is there a hard limit on the amount of cans we can drop on a gate to decloak cloakies?"
9/13/2013,"dropping cans and probes (before odyssey) to decloak cloakies is a game exploit which is against the rules 60 cans means pretty much all gate has been coveredof course if gm feels that a particular can droppings at a gate is to decloak, it will remove it and give you a warning / ban, depending on what's your karma status in game i hope that there is not a particular number of cans allowed as that would lead to again the same thing i think its a matter of your intentions with the dropped cans rather than a specific number, if there is 100 cans 100 drones on grid around one gate ranging from 0-200km then its probably not someone using the exploit but remains after a fight, of course you can use the remains to your own advantage i guess if you catch someone that way you are pretty much safe from gm firepsshame on you"
9/13/2013,"i just double checked the tos and i couldn't find a rule that makes this claim in addition, we were told that we broke rule 16"
9/13/2013,"how is burn jita fine and droping cans on a gate not? its not about lag, its about decloaking cloaky ships if a handful of cans messes up your servers, then the problem is your servers if you don't want can's on gate, make the gate guns shoot cans don't loose your minds and threten to ban someone who had nothing to do with the can droping what the hell, its a legitimate pvp stategy how many bubbles on a gate can i have before i get baned? how about drones? how many drones can a fleet have out before the corp ceo gets baned? avoid asshatteryps enjoy these paying coustomer tears"
9/13/2013,please listen to your own suggestion
9/13/2013,"im going to come right out and say i greatly support adding a delay to local, or at least something that actually gives hunters a chance to catch the prey. it's common knowledge that null-sec (in a lot of areas at least) is more safe than high sec simply because of the local channel, and this shouldn't be.having said that, a 2 minute delay is kinda insane. even 30 seconds is on the long end. that essentially means that for people who are good with dscan you can jump in, warp and have point before the nullbears even know you're there. a 15-30 second delay is most likely a better window. or tie it in with sov upgrades - it starts at 30 seconds and can get down to 15 seconds with a fully upgraded system.this would also mean that more ratters and miners would die in nullsec, which is how it should be. but because of that, there should be more incentive to be out there. we need to keep in mind the risk vs. reward aspect of the game as well. the easiest solution to this that i can see is giving bigger bounties on rats in null specifically and shifting more ore/ice, or have more of the rarer stuff out there. (this is hypothetical, i've never mined so that could be way off base).the other benefit of this change is the nerfing of afk cloaking via the buffing of roaming. nobody likes it when theres an afk cloaker in system, and frankly it's much more fun to not have to afk cloak until people get sick of waiting, which sometimes is never.in the end, a hunter being proficient with dscan should counteract in some small part all the intel channels and in-system support that the prey often has. the prey has all the tools and more that the hunter has, and this means that somebody who is very very good can catch pve'rs, and on the flip side pve'ers who are paying attention can still always get out safely."
9/13/2013,"making null crappier to carebear in won't bring about some gankers heaven, it'll just mean the stubborn holdouts that do 'bear in null will just move to highsec. the rewards are very nearly as good anyway and much more convenient. they added a whole new system of no local null called wormholes, go see how popular that is.anyway tons of miners and ratters die every day in null. go ask those gankers how they're doing it."
9/13/2013,that's absurd. in an npc corp highsec long as you aren't blinged out and know how to fit a tank is you can travel afk & 'bear whenever the fancy takes you with very little risk. see how far that gets you in null.
9/13/2013,"they find clueless players screwing up.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
9/13/2013,"right, same as gankers in highsec. being gankable any time even in you're doing every right will make 'bearing in null a whole crapload less attractive. without major buffs that will never happen it wouldn't be worth the risk at all."
9/13/2013,"what makes you think you can catch someone in null, who neither consents to the encounter, nor makes a serious error?can you stop them from hitting warp, if they were aligned to a pos or outpost?no. they either screw up and ignore you, or they wanted to meet you.as to suggesting you can make them undock in a slow to align ship, that is the same as saying you can make them screw up.i want your mind powers, in that case.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."

9/13/2013,"i agree with you here.that being said, it is more fun playing against other players, in a more direct sense.(at least i believe this to be true)i would much prefer having to earn my own intel, and having those who would hunt me needing to meet this same requirement.i could have many more options to counter them, rather than simply flee or fight.hiding, for example. misdirection for another.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
9/13/2013,scanning has gotten too easy.my thoughts:leave highsec aloneiincrease the loot amount for lowsec add a scan array module (upgradeable module i-hub) for null sec to increase the amount of sites.

9/14/2013,"you have posted three times in this thread without once being constructive. you don't want more ways to fight in high sec, more fighting or perhaps you are just a disinterested in the subject and randomly posting? you must have a mind, i promise no nasty men will break into your house if join in with the discussion in a reasonable way. if your opinion, what ever it might be, is valid then why is that, what is it etc., can you not persuade others that it is a good pov, if so why?"
9/14/2013,"are we talking to ccp about the tos?of course we are.can i tell you what we are saying and what is being said back to us?of course not. any discussions in our backroom channels are nda'd to death but if you look to the active threads you will see that people like mynnna and ali are strongly involved in the discussion trying to find a common ground, talking and listening to you. do you think that is only on the public side?give us time, between the time differential and the fact that we are going into a weekend, give us time. i am not saying drop the subject, if it is something you feel passionate about let us know what you think. just don't expect instantaneous response time.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
9/14/2013,"this pops up every so oftendropping cans to decloak people is allowed to a point the general consensus is that there is no problem until you might cause lag with the sheer amount of cans on grid see it as a ""common sense"" thing; 20 or so cans would be okay 60 would most likely be a ""problem""interestingly, the same policy also applies to anchor-able warp disruptor bubblesbtw the rules have never been clear or precise on purpose because what causes or does not cause lag varies from situation to situation depending on general server health and populationedit: as far as the comparison between burn jita and spamming causing lag goes one is players doing their thing the other is player generated trash"
9/14/2013,"well i plan on pushing the rule as far as we can go before i break tos there has to be a line in the sand somewhere saying x amount of cans (trash) is too muchwill we be banned if we drop 59 cans?well, in this case we were camping inside barleguet this system is easily one of the most active systems in the game it almost always shows up as a giant red blob when filtering the star map for ships destroyed in the past 24 hours, number of pilots docked and active, etc"

9/14/2013,i am spartacus!
9/14/2013,"like i said there is no hard or fast rule about it it's a judgement call at the gm's discretion because there will be times where 10 cans will create detectable amounts of lag and there will be other times where 100 won'tagain, the general consensus among many (in quite a few threads) is that you should use a bit of common sense you don't need to go ""overkill"" right away when you can pull off largely the same results with lessi'm trying to see if i can find the gm post (that i distinctly recall) that explains this but i seem to have trouble finding itfake edit:this actually happens more often than you think goonswarm leaders (and their pets) were sometimes eve-mailed over certain station names they had no knowledge of and/or actions of underlings when no one perp could be singled outsee it as a ""get your house in order"" type warning and not as a direct threat against the ceo"
9/14/2013,"oh, your objections are fine. but what your suggesting is not an addition to the model, it's a totally different model.i was merely pointing out that people commenting about the bandwith useage and that ""game is not designed for such control"" are writing about the idea in the op, and not about your idea about the hotkeys."

9/15/2013,"problem=======its very difficult for small corps and alliances to establish a foot hold in null security. null space is vast but very underused. null sec should be used for fighting for and keeping space not renting space you don't need to others.possible solution============== sov assets do not send a message to the alliance they are under attack or damaged. they show up on screen with hp listed - territorial control unit [100%] or pos shield [30%] (in red if damaged). edit: originally proposed changing timers to 48 hours but decided to leave them as they are. edited out: [they still reinforce but for 48 hours instead of 24]. they need to be repped back up.how does this solve the problem?===========================if assets did not send a message removing the need for players to actually notice that they are under attack then a small alliance could come into a region that has been tcu'd but not occupied by the alliance and kill them. if they wanted to remain anonymous, as in not showing up on the map as occupying the system then they could simply not deploy their own tcu. if a person has a pos then they should be logging in every day or every other day to check on it. relying on the server to police other players actions leads to invulnerability to the larger alliances and requires no work to be done. one can simply wait for an automated email from the server.with this change a small corp or alliance could go into the very underused parts of null sec, all of which are claimed and destroy that old moon holding pos that no one uses, set up their own, build their strength, make allies with other like minded corps alliances and perhaps become powerful enough to challenge the existing monolithic and stagnant null sec alliances that aren't using that space at all."
9/15/2013,but that's just it - it's not a crime.think of it as doing the dishes to pay for your meal. :)
9/15/2013,"all that happened with this scam is a guy did his homework and made everyone look like an idiot in the process. with precision and guile he undermined ccp's dependence on chribba, darkness, grendel and rene de'labou to preform a function they were just to lazy to code into the game. can't say i'm all to impressed with isd's performace of managing evelopdia either. its analogous to the fat lazy tsa security agent, asleep on the job, and lets a gun or drugs get onto a plane. so yes if you literally can't log onto a wiki and check the edit history and have enough common sense to know something isn't right then no one should trust you. it's not like evelopedia is kept up to date or accurate to begin with as evidenced by the fact many player organizations keep their own wiki's as a source of real knowledge on the game.i can understand feeling duped or even embarrassed at having one guy work over an entire paid company and its volunteers to run riot in a environment of increasing complacency and incompetence. what i refuse to understand, because it requires accepting a few fallacies, is retro actively punishing someone to cover up said complacency and incompetence. the person stupid enough to fall for a glorified shell game shouldn't be rewarded with gm intervention. let the fool pay for his foolishness, let the clever man profit."
9/15/2013,"ccp is trying hard to remove any discernible lines in the sand to avoid exactly that behaviorthis has been a common theme across very different fields of gm decisions over the past years - be it how the eula applies to 3rd party software (where exactly is the line between an allowed keyboard macro and a bot), the protection of new players (what does ccp mean when talking about ""rookies""?), cache reading (""it's against the eula but we won't enforce the eula in this case - unless you use the cache reader to automate gameplay, then we will enforce the reverse-engineering clause in the eula""), to the new impersonation policies, to use an example: a rookie generally is a player within his 30 days of eve - unless you get the idea that baiting 31 or 32 day old players is ok it's about following the spirit of the tos rather than about looking for loopholes in its letter looking for loopholes is a good way to get gms to punish youccp has been fighting the extension of the ""harsh & ruthless"" nature of the in-game universe into the metagame for some time now it really shouldn't come as a surprise"
9/15/2013,"i mostly agree with thisi'm huge fan of finding loopholes and playing with the ""grey area"" with regards to rules (because it wouldn't be eve without doing such things) and i must admit, i'm a little leery of the new tos rules regarding ""impersonation"" (i feel there needs to be some serious clarification on the matter)however, pushing things to the utter limit is actually how we get more and ""harder"" restrictions placed upon us and ""hard"" restrictions become dicey when you are dealing with dynamic issues such as server performancelet me put it another wayimagine yourself as a gm your job is to ensure a stable server and prevent player abuse without infringing [too much] on emergent gameplayyou get a petition from a player that a group is spamming cans all over a gate you know that enough debris over a concentrated area will cause lag for some people but you also know that can spam is a perfectly legitimate form of gameplay which would you be more inclined to ignore/write-off; - the group launching only 10 or 20 cans and isn't making more unless the old ones disappear?or- the group that has made 60 cans and seems to be making more as time goes on?"
9/15/2013,"no we don't all love it for the most part its bad for both sides of the equationfor the blobbed you have 1) no chance 2) your fitting, skills, real life skills and ship invalidated by raw dps 3) no fun at allfor the blobbed you have 1) no risk 2) your fitting, skills, real life skills and ship invalidated by raw dps 3) its boring and completely unchallengingsolo / small gang pvp needs to be improved drasticallyi posted this in another thread but ill repeat it here yesterday i fitted up a t2 fitted blaster mega my intention was to get it exploded in rancer as i had noticed a t3 legion, t2 oneiros and t1 drake on a gate flashy red it was a suicide mission but might still be fun i jump into rancer locked / scrammed the legion, the drake n logi docked, legion jumped into next system and docked 3 v 1 they refused to engage this morning i undocked in same mega jumped from rancer to creleire or whatever its called same guy that was in legion was camping in a harbinger with a logi i lock up the harb start shooting him, not long i have about 10 pandemic legion dropped on mei don't care about the ship but i do care about the game and its currently pure shite when 3 vs 1 run from the 1 because of risk aversion and even 2 vs one they need to be able to drop 10 other ships on you before they'll engage in a fightedit: actually i just noticed the pl guys helped kill the guy in the harb so i guess they were just roaming in a girlie blob and ran into us already engaged"
9/15/2013,"we recently got a new recruit in our corp who has returned to the game post-odyssey to see how exploration has 'improved'.he recently emailed me and stated that his main way of making money is no longer viable. we of course gave him all kinds of tips about running combat sites - but still, he even is considering unsubbing from the game because the way he liked to make isk is no longer viable.i will offer yet another possible solution.you make all sites harder to scan down but introduce 3 new scanning skill books for each type of site; something like combat signature triangulation, data signature triangulation, and relic signature triangulation.the more you have your specialty triangulation skill trained up, the easier it is to find that type of site. we have a real problem here with exploration in eve now. the odyssey buzz lasted for maybe 6 weeks at best and its now expired leaving exploration a diminishing eve profession."
9/15/2013,"it's true, i am contemplating just unsubbing. the problem is that i feel pigeonholed into doing combat sites; in a game that emphasizes player freedom and choice this is a death sentence. i was loving exploration before - i built up my scanning skills and worked towards an arbi that could scan down and clear radar/mag sites in mostly low-sec; i am just not willing to risk low-sec now because the payoff is questionable at best. the 'mini-game' is something i can get used to and i even like the idea of adding some challenge to the sites themselves, although the 'mini-game' feels highly dependant on pure luck - the loot pinata mechanic is just...a strange choice, i just don't understand what that is about; ""oh no they got past our firewalls! explode all loot!"". now it feels like that build i was using is just worthless and the scanning skills i built up are inconsequential. i am a new player, i don't have any brilliant ideas for making exploration better, like those helpful players above me, but i can offer up my feelings on the state of exploration in the hopes that it can be improved.-withey"
9/15/2013,if it had been implemented properly with real content that tied into the game in space and with a graphics engine that didn't potentially slow cook graphics cards it might have worked. as it is now the best thing that could happen is its removal asap because all it does is remind us of what could have been a really interesting addition to the game.
9/15/2013,"get a graphics card that isn't an embarrassment to pc gamers everywhere, and it works great. with a three year old budget card, you can run everything in incarna on top settings.it needs to be added to, not removed."

9/16/2013,"""only to use in sov space"" thank you for that, i thought this was going to be another give me a ship no one can gank in hisec so i can afk mine. i thought there were a few industrial caps in game that did some of this already?"
9/16/2013,"reading it you start off whining, than you went constructive, but as ganking has been nerfed hard most gankers will read even that as whining. ""clearly there are issues when i high sec gate camp near dodi can pop any ship they want (mostly industrials) simply because they want to"" nope that is called risk, hi-sec is not safe, if it is pushed down that road (of being a non-pvp zone) than i suggest all rocks/ice be moved to low or null, otherwise the market will become trash. if you are running around with a expensive load of materials (10m+ or 1b+) they will target you, i will target you, and you are doing it wrong."
9/16/2013,"ok, you want my opinion?when you break down the ops suggestion, it amounts to putting some rules in place that an aggressor has to follow or the war-dec that they are paying for becomes invalid. his justification is that in real life if a soldier does not fight he will be punished for being awol.however he fails to suggest how the defender in the war will be punished should they not fight.my thoughts are, that his main is in a corp that was decked. they stopped playing and hid in stations. but the person who decked them did not show up all week. despite nobody showing up to fight, he still hid in the station, and tried to come up with a change to the game to make things easier for him and his current situation.he also created an alt just to post this idea rather than putting the ""one or two characters"" that decked him, into contacts and monitoring them, while going about his business.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
9/16/2013,"you may lack experience of high sec wars as you seem unaware of a tactic that is familiar to me. it is a no brainer a lot of the time that the wt will have alts watching, i've been in a war where the aggressor had more alts than corp members - a side effect of a desire for a 'perfect' killboard i assume. half the point is to lull you into 'going about your business' under the watch of the alts, then as if a shock on log the wt's. essentially it isn't worth the risk of going about your normal business but there will be no wt's to shoot unless you undock something 'shiny' or at least easy to kill. that is not to say that you cant use that to make a trap but that is usually tedious, certainly a long way from being a rewarding use of time. you can not be watched 23/7 but without prior knowledge and tedious research you can not be certain who is watching you or have them all on your watch list, you don't know who the enemy is. there are more interesting things to do in this world than mess about not fighting a war in eve. fighting and winning is also a huge risk, especially if you don't want to be in a war. as the aggressor can not call in allies you get fresh war decs instead, turning seven days of something you don't want into ten plus days is not smart.the aggressor in a war has the purpose of shutting the corp down, that or surrender are the conditions that end wars early, perhaps there should be some penalty if the aggressor does not achieve that aim.as a defence docking up is the best, totally effective. it would seem odd to penalise the defender for using a defensive tactic that is 100% effective. i cant think what else the defender should achieve in war than a 100% effective defence and still be operating after seven days - surely fulfilling that role so effectively should earn a reward rather than a penalty, more so when the defender has assets in space that are totally ignored. a lot of problems do seem to relate to the use of these roles as they create expectations that are unrealistic.i do agree that there is currently absolutely no point in a defender fighting a war and that might lead to suggesting some form of carrot via penalty for the defender but all such ideas tend to be impractical because you can not force players to log in. that does logically lead to considering the aggressor, if the defender fighting could in some hurt or hinder the aggressor in a meaningful way then that could perhaps help persuade the defender to fight. however, as you demonstrated, there is a great deal of hostility towards such an approach.currently it is fairly pointless for either side to do anything unless they are certain it kills them more isk than they can lose - that tends to lead to stalemate at best. using an alt to post an opinion about anything on these forums is reasonable, especially where a war dec may effect more that just four corp members where at least three are one persons alts. i don't think it is fair to risk a week of all my corps mates playtime by joining in with the forum with my main so i use an alt. i pay a subscription like everyone else and feel i have a right to express an opinion as an account holder rather than a character, the idea that we must get caught up in role-play when discussing game mechanics is daft but can be the case."
9/16/2013,"so would you have been fine with it if ccp had simply said 'bravo you got us that time, congratulations to you, but anyone who does this in the future will cop a ban' and had worded the tos change accordingly?my personal opinion is that because it involved evelopedia, which after all is a ccp administered site through the isd, they want to make it crystal clear that mucking about with ccp stuff in the cause of scamming is definetely out of order. doesnt change the fact the communication has been pretty crappy but im willing to let the csm work that out because thats one of the things we elected them to do."
9/16/2013,"the correct and mature response would have been for ccp to allow the scam to stand, announce that the tos needed to be reworked if this is really that big a deal, and carried on. the new wording of the tos leaves something to be desired, and i am sure the csm and ccp are working on that in joint effort to reach a satisfactory conclusion. one of the things this highlights and i think is important is the implicit endorsement of certain players who engage in facilitating 3rd party transactions. in ccp's own reasoning the wiki and the articles therein give the appearance of an endorsement by ccp. so having pages for players like chribba is a de facto endorsement by ccp of one player over others who might be involved n 3rd party transactions. let's say someone wants to ""be the next chribba,"" how much harder will it be for them to break into the 3rd party market? some player will say:i wonder who i should use for a 3rd party, oh look, evelopedia says i should use chribba since it lists him as a trusted third party.if i am wrong why is it the only people that get requested to do third party transactions are the ones that just happened to be listed in evelopedia? i'm no industrialist by any means but i think its crap that a monopoly is held by certain people over certain transactions in the game."
9/16/2013,"this. so many times, this.also, if the receiving warehouse/landing pad is full, perhaps the production facility pauses production?"
9/16/2013,"o/can we please see when we will receive our next neural remap availability bonus remap point ?currently the system doesn't tell you, when you still got 1 or more left, when the next extra bonus remap point will be.so for example if you currently have one bonus remap and want to plan ahead for example capital ships, you can't plan that well because you have no idea when you will get the 2nd bonus remap after the 1st bonus remap point.it's hard to save 2 or more neural remap points this way,because if you use a remap point for example a month before you get the next one,the timer no doubt resets to another full year waiting, and there is no way knowing,with the current system if you should have waited that month or not."
9/16/2013,"bonus remaps come from special circumstances, such as when learning skills got removed or for christmas gifts from the devs. you don't need a timer to tell when you're going to get a new bonus because...well...you're probably not.edit: you got bonus remaps for new characters. same rules apply.weeeekeeee ->"
9/16/2013,"you can't ""naturally"" accumulate remaps. even if you don't spend a remap for a whole year, you can never have more than one unless ccp has a special event/gift that gives you the extra."

9/17/2013,i definitely would like to see something like this (even if not this exact idea) come to be. the expansion to the industry/hauler game would be game-changing.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
9/17/2013,to the top.hrolt ceo live free; die proud
9/17/2013,"+1 op sums it up and has the cpu/pg/rate i'd like to seewhat all the 'muh stations' people are forgetting is that a pos costs 110-440m/month to fuel, so stations are still better even with 100% refine on poses.now where the hell is this pos patch we've be"
9/17/2013,"while constant ship/module re-balances are great and all, and the revamp to exploration makes it a significantly more viable career, i would like to draw attention to a career/ui that has been overlooked for some time--corporation management. as frivolous as that may sound, the current user interface for managing permissions is not only unclean and disorganized, but also inflexible and incredibly limited. to clarify, here are some problems: my corporation has an infrastructure wherein we purchase goods from our members based off of a % of the tool tip value that has been researched/tested to be extremely close to average market price. we do this through the usage of contracts which can be viewed/accepted from anywhere in new eden and beyond which allows a fast transfer of goods internally. however, because anyone in the corp can accept a contract assigned to the corporation for themselves, and the ""contract manager"" permission just allows people to pay for contracts with corp money, rather than deciding who can accept things on behalf of the corp (as it should). we currently have to have people assign the contracts to individual officers based on their location in reference to that officer's home base, which means the time frame of it being accepted is based on that individual member's real life schedule, and since many of us have to log into real life from time to time this could mean a delay of up to a couple days which is far from satisfactory. the lack of a total tooltip for contracts is infuriating. while such a tool-tip would be visible on a container, it is not on the contracts themselves, which complicates the kinds of things we can move in this manner and how we have to move them. there is no way to make a character ""based at"" a pos, which means in order to give permissions at a pos i have to give permissions to the member under the ""at other"" basis, which means he gains those permissions at all facilities--other than hq. there is no way to let people simply view the balance of a wallet without letting them take from it. ""accountant"" just allows you to pay bills (most of which can be set up as auto pay) while ""jr accountant just allows you to view said bills"". ""accountant"" for some reason also allows people to buy and sell things for the corp, which is what the ""trader"" role does. when a character has wallet access he immediately gains the ability to withdraw to his personal account, which invalidates permissions such as ""rent factory,"" ""trader,"" and ""contract manager"" which allows them to use the corp wallet for certain things (they could instead just withdraw to their personal and do it anyways). there is no way to tax anything other than missions. this is bull because npc corps can tax you a portion of your minerals from refining and the like. running a corp is free if you own no offices, which leads to people making 1 man corps just to dodge npc tax rates. this needs to be addressed as it is practically an exploit and encourages the formation of way too many corporations. i mean, alliances are not free, why should a corp be? make a startup fee, and perhaps a maintenance fee based on size might do it. while this may not be a popular idea to most, it is something that should be done. there are too many bs corps that do nothing but dodge taxes. (please read post #16 for full explanation). point is, the permissions in general are unorganized, bulky, and overlap one another to a major degree. while some may argue that a change to this structure would only ever be seen directly by about 5% of players (those that assign permissions) it would affect 90% of players that are not in an npc corp, (with the others being in single leader corps/alliances, or 1 man fake corps). while everyone loves seeing the dominix get rebalanced, and then 3 months later have the rebalance reversed, there are other things that need to be focused on. honestly scanning was a very limited profession. in fact it used to be classified as a mini-profession. i am glad ccp revamped this, now it is a viable and obvious thing. corporation management isn't that far behind in terms of number of people that would benefit from it being overhauled. seriously. if we add a moderate fee to create a corporation, add a small numbers based fee to maintain a corporation (making them akin to current day alliances), and revamp the permissions so they actually work, it would lessen the number of corps in existence greatly as people would consolidate. more corporations like red frog/black frog/blue frog in terms of recognizably would come into existence, and we would reach a point where a corp is actually a corp, rather than a corp being a ""social clan."" eve is economy based, it needs this. the changes above are a must, and they need to be implemented soon. however, if ccp would like to go the route of a full fledged expansion... just one... for business, it would be appreciated. perhaps add more contract options like ""peace treaties,"" or allow corps to rent out their manufacturing facilities to the public. hell, something that would be an amazing work of art would be to allow corps to become ""publicly traded"" once they hit a certain number of players and allow the corp to sell shares on the market. i could see test and goonswarm becoming popular stocks in eve. a structure that would auto-deduct isk from a corp wallet to pay a dividend and having said dividend listed in that stock market would allow players to supplement their income by investing in various corporations. the point here is that white collar work is still work, and deserves just as much attention as exploration, which prior to odyssey, was barely used. hell, this could be when you would finally enable the promised harvesting array ii's ^.^ even if we don't elect for a full expansion, a simple patch to fix most of what is outlined would be great."
9/17/2013,"thanks for your post!i hate afk mining tbh, i really like to encourage ppl to fight for their own space.and we dont have an advantage vs high sec mining, fuel costs dont even let you bring minerals from null and sell in hs at a profitable price.industry needs a revamp"
9/17/2013,"yep in a nutshell that i the problem with wars in high sec.....alts(or alternate accounts) is a very good way to keep eyes out for the enemy.....i use them myself but in my case my pvp toons are my alts....i use them only for projecting a political statement/power whether that is a gank or dec. but there are other means as well....using your friends that the enemy does not know about...omg neutral reppers/pvp toons what a concept.get used to it and quit your bellyaching....now as i understand it....ppl can offer to assist others in their defense and join the war....but not an aggressor.hmm i think thats need to change...for one there is abuse to aggress someone and then have an alt corp offer assistance for a sum of isk.corps that wish to should be able to join either side if warranted applicable by either defender or aggressor.....and if someone joins the war on the side of which ever the increased pay should be immediately taken from the sides wallet.if the war is basically concluded in a clear cut victor (defender side/aggressor side) then assisting corps get that cash paid to their corp's wallet. makes an incentive for ppl to enter a wardec already in place, might cut down on wardec scams, and gives those trying to start or maintain a small merc corp the ability to make (or increase) a reputation for themselves.side note: shadow alliances....if ppl are in a fleet together but in an alliance but different corps....there should be ways to agress the entire fleet not wait till someone assists in a battle to be able to shoot them....new suspect system i think may help the majority of such issues...need more thought on this, just saying tho."
9/17/2013,"for those of you wondering why i wrote that we are an alliance of about 150 people we have been at war for just over a month and a half there is rarely nobody online in my alliance and we certainly don't stay docked up, the aggressing corp is a 2 man corp that has been seen online for maybe 10 minutes collectively for the entire war. it just seems like abuse of the war dec system to me but it is within the rules. and those of you trolls i will not post my alliance or corporation im not new to eve and i don't want more war declarations."
9/17/2013,"oh look, another 150 man alliance that is scared of 2 people that barely log in."
9/17/2013,"how do people who are logged out stop anyone doing anything?i mean afk cloaker whines are bad enough, but complaining about people who aren't even logged in? come on now."
9/17/2013,"so if it has no effect on you, where's the ""abuse""?"
9/17/2013,"to put it simply its keeping a few of us from incursions, i know a lot of people don't care for them but they are part of the game and its what we pay to do. i would be fine with a month and a half war with people who actually come online for more than a minute a week but that is not the case and there is no way to get back at them."
9/17/2013,"as already covered, the alt watches for the juicy target, the aggressor has no need to put themselves in any danger. there is no reason to ban alts but you would have to be utterly naive to not understand the role they play. the defender is only ever a target of opportunity under the current system, not really a combatant. there is no opportunity to take the fight to the aggressor and nothing the defender does will achieve anything worthwhile, such as ending the war early or destroying meaningful assets. using a game mechanic to put the equivalent of 37.5 subscriptions into a game mode that is essentially unplayable or at least restricted for the entertainment of half a subscription doesn't really fit into abuse, exceptionally high on the crap design front though. war is supposed to entail armed conflict, i think it is the definition of war - we do have plenty of arms but a distinct lack of anything to shoot at - unless you set sail in a mining barge but that is a bit of a moot point. if 152 people are involved by the system then the system should provide them something to do, war should be a positive event and not a reason to groan.the current system pretty much serves to prevent combat, if 150 people could wipe out a two man corp in a matter of seconds as logic says they should be able to do using rookie ships and by throwing rocks then there would be some sense to it at least but such an obvious, complete, rapid and inevitable victory is far beyond what the war system is capable of providing. it is impractical to go about your business as normal during war, that should be the case and shouldn't change but since your normal gameplay has been interrupted an alternative must be provided and it should be up to the aggressor to provide it 23/7 - anchored assets seem practical in achieving that."
9/17/2013,"it sounds like the action ccp should have taken would have been to delete the evelopedia. it would elimanate any appearance of ccp endorsing players, plus it would have the side benefit of getting players to find better sources of information than something pretending to be a wiki.to see what i mean by it only pretending to be a wiki, go to any ship page. click edit. note that the stat block for the ship is not editable. if evelopedia was truly a wiki, then everything would be editable. but since it's not, it can't be a wiki."
9/17/2013,"solo/small gang pvp needs to be improved by you in your mind it is what you make of itif people don't want to engage you then you can't do much to change that that's what the sandbox is all about, if they don't want to take a change to loose a ship then why engage? (i understand it's frustrating), if people have a fleet and you take the bait then, you will probably die if your megathron got caught on a belt by a pilgrim, falcon and a rapier and died slowly would you be angry then? if yes why? it was only 1v3, only that the game mechanics ensured that they will be safe no matter what ship you bring against themnobody enjoys when they die, every loss gives us a particular information about a corp/alliance/system/tactics and more information like this make you a better pvp playerif you think it needs to be improved because you don't kill anything and die all the time then you must be doing something wrong and change things there is countless hours of evidence in form of pvp videos on youtube or evefiles that solo it's still possible, alive and bubbling with life a lot of time these videos don't show you times when you get blobbed to hell (i don't put these fights in my videos either), which happens a lotsolo small gang was, is and (i hope) will remain extremely hard purely because of blobbing and people wanting an easy kill and not a good fight don't expect people to give you kills for free (it happens but not often) purely for this reason i want to solo, i would never want it to be easy, because i'd loose the amazing feeling of victory against the odds if you knew you can win or loose fights at the start of the fight, eve would loose one of the important things why i play the game and that's the adrenaline rush and not knowing what's comingstop putting goddamn templates to something which is already perfect just because you are unlucky or don't have enough experience to find a good fight i'm getting quite annoyed with thisedit: your avatar is sexy"
9/17/2013,"there might be other ways to go about finding engagements for solo pilots, but nothing wrong with your approach sandbox etc 07m8m8!"
9/17/2013,"if you agree please post a comment saying so. this is easy.an eve legal system / court of appeals?from this... so i propose a venue for people to talk about petitions and responses. a wiki of easy-to-follow albeit extensive rules and incidents of precedent so we stop having these same problems with people getting banned because they couldn't find the rule. perhaps even a csm appointed court of appeals? (edit: court of appeals a bad idea) it solves a lot of problems imho, and would be kind of cool."
9/17/2013,"yes to some codification of clear ""yes/no"" cases that have been brought to the gms.no to a court of appeals."
9/17/2013,maybe you're right. you probably are in fact... so no appeals court. i still think it would be a good idea to explicitly outline all the rules and allow capsuleers to edit the wiki to include a multitude of scenarios so as to remove any doubt about the rules.
9/17/2013,there are different levels of risk that go along with the different areas that pocos are in. high sec has the lowest risk possible and thus has the lowest possible returns. low sec has slightly more risk to it and you can make more isk out in low sec. and null sec and wh space offer the best planets and as such you get the best isk out of them. if you want to make more isk which is what is sounds like you are wanting then you should go to the low sec or null sec/ wh space and take the risk to make the isk. high sec is the place that isk is made in eve if you want it you have to go get it.drunk bastard

9/18/2013,so are we geting any more form this or any one know any thing?
9/18/2013,mad kudo's for infinite force. nice going keeping this up top. i might even start mining in my system if this ever happens.
9/18/2013,"read the first 5-6 replies.. got boring.. i agree with poster.. should be able to reset skill points..i also agree with everyone against it.. for old chars its way imba and would ruine the game.. thus, why not offer new players a chance to have a 1 time skill reset that expires after say.. 1 year?ive put points into gunnery, shield, etc.. when im an armor tank.. before i learned about different tank styles and weaponry, i kind of just put all of a mish mash into everything.. its usefull, if i used itbut never will.. now i know the game it would be nice to specialise more towards my hearts content now that i atleast know which direction to go."
9/18/2013,"okay, middle ground yearly opportunity to shift a to-be-determined number or skill points from 1 skill to another.this is remove from skills and add that to skills with a capacity on the number of movable points.i'm thinking 25000 to 50000 per year, no more. if johnny plays the same toon for 5 years he could move x per year that's 5 times xif that were 25000 per year in five years he could move the points from mining on a pvp toon to something else and then shift some other around to fit his model. want to move them back.. got to wait, sorry. no gm request for the adjustment, you reap what you sow until the next year.no it would not stack year on year. whatever the value it would be always have its yearly amount no more. use it or lose it.but no sorry, not allow him to totally revamp the whole toon every year. that would be a nightmare.everyone wins, new and old. allow the flexibility that experience and commitment to a toon should enable without super charging, no one gets super powers.i see no reason to deny people the right to remove a skill, if they choose to lose the skill points. if they just want a ""cleaner"" character/skill tree. some folks are that way."
9/18/2013,"i have a simple suggestion that i think would drastically reduce ""hot drops"", and restore the cyno to what i assume was it's original purpose.... a method of fast travel and strategic placement of forces, not as an active combat tactic.create a new aggression flag.... any ship lighting a cyno or jumping thru a cyno, or any form of bridge (titan and covert), can not target anything for 1 minute. (or simply add this to the normal 1 min aggression timer that prevents gate jumping.)if the cyno ship has something locked, it should break their target locks (much like entering siege mode on a dreadnaught) and they should get the timer as well.this should be a very simple thing to add, and not require much dev time, as the mechanisms for this is already in the game.this change does not nerf anything.... it simply would be too risky for people to ""drop"" directly on top of someone, as they would be sitting ducks for 1 minute. instead, they can still drop into a system, but it would have to be done at a safe spot, and then the entire fleet warp into the battle.yes i realize this would not completely eliminate hot drops.... it could still be done, but would require 2 ships instead of 1.... a cyno ship, and a tackle ship. and at least the victim(s) have a chance to kill or jam out the tackle ship and get away during the 1 minute timer.it sure would be nice to go back to the days of normal roaming fleets, instead of suddenly getting 50 guys dropped on your head out of no where, from many light years away, with absolutely no possible defense or escape.while your at it, it would not hurt to make the cyno jammer mod for the poss also block covert cyno's. as it is now, its an insane cost added to sov bills, and is almost worthless, as people can still drop in a 100 man sb fleet and kill a cyno jammer in 5 minutes or less.thanks."
9/18/2013,"uhm... i dont know about u, but i never thought of hotdrops being something that needs fixing.force projection on the other side...."
9/18/2013,"my newb 2 cents -was looking to buy isk and found this thread instead and am now going to buy plex to sell.why buy isk : i was going to buy isk because the whole benefit of eve online for me is i can level while busy at work and such, don't have the time to grind it out. i wanted to get enough to buy some implants so that i'm utilizing all that downtime appropriatly so i can catch up and just jump right in. i understand op's view, but isk buying will happen because people like myself have money not time. this makes me feel less like a criminal and more like i'm furthering the game as a whole, one by paying ccp and two by giving the real dedicated players free play for their hard work."

9/18/2013,"i couldn't agree more. however with the reaction from ccp being one of sheer knee jerk it almost in some elements breaks the very sandbox they claim to promote. scamming has always been a grey area merely because it's a core element of the ""risk"" new eden gives players.that risk and subsequent consequence is indeed the one quality that puts eve a cut above other mmo's and i'd implore ccp to remember this. risk vs reward. does my fleet engage the other? do i take that chance jumping into low sec? do i really risk my hard earned isk for a super simply because someones name is ""reputable?"" it all comes down to greed in the case of the scam. here:"
9/18/2013,"while i personaly have my problems with eve's culture of scamming, in this case i have to say that ccp is reacting very badly and inmature.the guy who caused the tos change should get a medal, if not a monument in every rookie system for beating the system.for me ccps reaction does let them look like they are simply butthurt, because someone showed the flaws of their system. also, i lost any trust into ccps ability to have a neutral point of view on any ingame activity. because anything i do now might not find ccps aproval and than i end up on the receving end. which basicly is what happened to this guy.the new tos and the explanation provided especially by gm karidor are no small change or clarification. they turn the world of new eden upside down.while i do not like all of eves curent mechanics ( i think the punishment for suicide ganks should be more severe for example), i do not wish eve turned into a hello kitty online theme park.if someone upsets me, i want to be able to kick him where it hurts. even if it costs me. and if someone is stupid, why should i not profit from it?what i would have liked to see coming out of this, is simply more ways to do honest buisness (i.e. a system where 3rd parties are no longer needed) and a evolution on certain flawed game mechanics.but as always when things should be carefully considered, ccp just nukes everything from orbit and calls the problem solved, while failing to realize why and how things went wrong."

9/19/2013,"seriously nikk, do you actually play eve to do player vs player, or just spend all your time championing an unpopular idea and doing forum pvp with anyone who happens to actually play the game and disagree with you.how many years have you been asking for local to be removed on the forums, and how many more years before you give up and realize that local is never going to be removed because:a. it's been in the game unchanged since day one.b. ccp have already made space without local intel, that being w-space.c. removing or nerfing local intel in any way would reduce the player base of eve, a commercially stupid ideastop trolling and actually play the game, you never know, you might actually make some friends that way."
9/19/2013,"a. do some research. local never reported your standings on day one, so you had to stop and right click on a name to learn if they were a threat. not a lot of effort, but better than it being done for you.b. if you are implying the significant difference between wormholes and regular space is only local, you haven't been in one.c. wow, you are either psychic, or pulling fake claims on us. please, explain why making intel effort based, and forcing the hostiles to make an effort suddenly makes my life harder. hint, i am a miner, it makes my life easier.stop the personal attacks, they dishonor you.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
9/19/2013,i question why local works the way it does. in highsec particularly i don't think it provides any significant benefit to have your name show up instantly. it makes things like wardecs hard to perform because the enemy knows when you're in system. removing the intel part of local would make some fairly sweeping changes to the game but i extremely doubt that any mechanic was derived from its function.

9/19/2013,"the tos offer us an opportunity to discuss how we optimally want ccp to handle such clever hacks of the system in the future... pool the ideas in this thread please!now for the tos situation and how it should have developed: clever scam involving messing with ccp info ressources triggers the following responses: ccp publishes the exploit in a big story with player/scammer interviews etc <- that's positive publicity! if the method is problematic, then the transfer has to be undone. all parties get a pat on the back in the form of a (limited) hauler full with quafe and dancers for finding the exploit/falling victim as a proof of concept the exploit is fixed in rl (wiki editing tools - proofed stable vs latest versions for example) ...and in-game through game mechanics as a last step tos etc are changed to reflect the new situation now in general terms this can be broken down to some steps that should be done to manage those situations in the future (i feel like public relations for game designers 101): it's not if but when: exploits and hacks can always be found, so accept it a 1000 eyes: publicity and proof-of-concept attacks help the game as a whole, so publish the stuff to have a part in shaping it. (no hard feelings allowed!) cleverness is good: reward people who make hacks public / are part (=victim) of a proof of concept together!!! both are part of the hack and should get some kind of in-game reward (*insert* hauler full with quafe and dancers) get input: now is the time to harness the power of the mad eve crowd to fix it separate approaches to rl / in-game hacks! everything that plays out in the sandbox is game content (yes, burn jita too) then call a lawyer and let him translate what you decided into legal secret speech party hard and listen to htfu by the great ccp band :p and please please never support people using out-of-game means to get back after they don't like specific game mechanics and how other players use them against them!!!!"
9/19/2013,"i agree that this latest episode was a pr disaster and demonstrated some blatant failures of internal processes within ccp. more that that, it seemed like a reversion to the pre-incarna attitudes that literally almost killed the game (and the company with it).that said, i'd rather wait until the tos issue is resolved on its own, then it should be time to hammer ccp about making some internal reviews so something like this is far less likely to occur again."

9/20/2013,"don't forget that you have to establish sbus before you can attack a tcu.most systems are ihubed, so you cannot immediately attack the tcu, but have to work your way through timers. also it is already not uncommon for alliances to sbu their own systems. these sbus have to be shot down, which generates a killmail and a notification to the owner of the sbu before you have even anchored your own sbus in their place.i'm not convinced your idea solves anything yet.you already can put up a pos and live in someone else's system if the owner isn't home."
9/20/2013,"those are all valid points. personally, i still can't fathom the stupidity behind letting neg10 players actually get into high-sec systems. shouldn't a criminal be stopped at shot at the gate? oh wait, concord and local police don't shoot pods, so i guess after i murder and mutilate several members of parliment, walking around naked will make me invisible to the local police force."

9/20/2013,"if you don't think its worth the time then don't do it it is what it is maybe try to use your map to see where activity is and don't roam empty systems and yes i guess megathron has a cyno breeze about it when seen solomaybe try jumping into 00 entry systems next time, they usually workand roam more, it seems like you went on a solo roam once or twice which weren't successful roams and you automatically make an assumption that it doesn't work out, just try harder it's not easy"

9/20/2013,"what about a better idea, as so many people wish to get people ratting in 00 for a fight, perhaps enabling a ship to have a limited re-fitting capability would allow the more aggresive ratter to take on the attacker, this will increase pvp significantly! blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
9/20/2013,"sadly, re-fitting mid-fight would be detrimental to most small pvp think rock paper scissors, except you get to use both hands instead of just onefrom what i can discern the primary reason people do not pvp is:a) no interest at all non zero nadab) lack of 'easy' targets ( see ganking )c) no solo targetsd) omg hotdrop!!

9/20/2013,"stupid idea is stupid and has been flogged to death on numerous threads, there are a lot of people who get kills regardless of local, what you purpose is to make it certain that you get a kill, a very easy kill.and talking about immediate intel, dotlan have a new function, its called npc kill delta, so you can narrow down someone ratting very quickly, while someone mining is invisible apart from having a report that there are toons in local.high sec level 4's and incursions will start to look like the only type of ratting to do unless you are one of the major blocks with an intel channel that actually works, not a smart move for ccp!!! blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"

9/21/2013,"its only a small change, not supposed to have a dramatic effect however:it will allow the removal of place holder pos that people put in to prevent use of moons.it will allow the removal of sbu's without generating an email and alerting alliances who are attempting to use sbu's the way you described.it will allow the removal of tcu's without alerting the alliances who don't police or otherwise reside in systems but place them there to prevent others using those systems.the onus needs to be on the alliances who ""claim"" systems to ensure that their assets are not under attack. if they fail to see a fleet blapping their assets and fail to see their assets have been damaged and gone into reinforced then its safe to assume they are not really in possession of those systems, rather the server is holding those systems for them. players and player actions should always be > server."
9/21/2013,"so, basically, what you have done is made alliance level logistics slightly more of a headache, while slowing down actual warfare by 100%. that means: more time to rep, instead of doing alarm clocking to rep shields. therefore making it much easier to outright avoid losses. twice as long for a reasonable attacker to take system. as well as functionally turning the entire game into dreadnaughts online, since you'd basically double the amounts of fights necessary to take the damn things. which would mean that power projection would become that much more valuable to alliances. as if sov grind actually needs to be more of a pain in the ass than it already is. and all because you're upset you couldn't sneak in a pos bash on the goonies."
9/21/2013,"you're in assembly hall, explain your reasoning?"
9/21/2013,"your failure to understand what i said is not a problem i have to deal with, fortunately. it's all there, and self apparent at that."
9/21/2013,"so you have nothing to say basically? not very helpful.in fact i have no slowed it down, i have sped it up very significantly if your enemy is lazy.consider period basis at the moment. use your map in game and look at pilots in space, pilots docked, npc's killed, etc etc... you will come up with virtually nothing at all. the entire region is claimed by goons but actually abandoned. anyone who is there is not a goon, mostly explorers and one or two plexers / ratters.now at the moment even though its abandoned if i took a fleet down there and tried to take sov, goons would get a message and form a big fleet up, wipe me out. with my change, i could put every single system in the region into reinforced, wait 48 hours and take the lot of them. why because they're undefended. that's how the game should be, players in system should be noticed and responded to by sov holders in system, server should serve not act as an alarm. if they're not there to use and defend the systems then they should lose those systems."
9/21/2013,"you received my input as it was, and responded with one sentence. what did you expect?and once everyone adapts in oh, say, a week before it goes live (since i'm pretty sure we all can read patch notes), and realizes that all they have to do is log in a few times a day to check it (little more difficulty involved than what exists now)?then, you have doubled the time it takes to take sov, in exchange for slightly more work on the part of the alliance/coalition logistics groups. at which point the game becomes far more of a grindy, horrific shoot-at-buildings nightmare than it already is.opening the window just gives the defender more opportunities to rep the station that the attacker would have to respond to within that timeframe. so now, instead of having to keep a standing fleet to stop determined repairs for 24 hours, you have to do it for 48 instead.you would literally have turned the meta into ""deny your opponent as much sleep as possible until they quit""."
9/21/2013,okay then i changed it to 24h.
9/21/2013,"at which point the crux of your entire idea becomes ""i hate sov holdings notifications"", and you aren't really proposing anything except to nerf something that you personally don't like."
9/21/2013,no not at all. i believe you're simply trolling this thread now. either say not supported or supported. pretty simple. the idea is a tweak to prevent alliances from locking up space and then abandoning it like goons have in period basis. it allows for the removal of towers put in place specifically to prevent others from utilizing the moon. it allows for small entities to attack sov structures that are not monitored without generating an email and getting wtfpwned 24 hours later.
9/21/2013,malcanis' law
9/21/2013,"no, it simply means that they log in once or twice a day instead, and you still get wtfpwned 24 hours later anyway. your problem, aside from getting butthurt about this failure of yours, is actually with power projection, not any pos mechanics.and yes, those poses are there for denial until they can get to them. specifically, so that they can avoid as much as possible the utterly unpleasant act of structure shooting, and force this unpleasantness upon people such as you. it's a smart meta play, nothing more. the goons do that a lot, by the way."

9/22/2013,"people rarely do this anymore, except perhaps when they're actively under attack and want to deny the attackers the ability to establish a staging tower, and in that case, believe me, they're going to know if a pos is attacked. outside of that situation, if there's a pos there it's being used somehow, even if it's just as a safespot. this isn't pre-dominion sovereignty anymore, it's really not worth the money.sbus are nominally an offensive structure, used to render the ihub and station vulnerable so you can attack them. so, in most cases, ""removing sbus without generating a mail"" is unnecessary. if an alliance is using them in the way that el 1974 describes, they're doing it because they're under attack and in that situation, believe me, their attacker knows they're there.except it really won't, because the process for system conquest is not ""show up, shoot tcu, claim system."" it's rather more involved, and if you want to make any suggestions about how sovereignty should work and hope to be taken seriously, i suggest you familiarize yourself with how it actually works. this article is a pretty good primer.and with that out of the way...why? says who? if i have, through conquest, taken space from a foe, who says i should not be able to rent access to that space out to interested parties? likewise, if there are parties interested in making use of nullsec space but who are unable or unwilling to take it by force, but willing to pay for it, why should they not be able to do so?"

9/22/2013,they still could. the only change would be the server not babysitting the system. the players who hold it would have to ensure it wasnt being attacked rather than relying on the server to tell them.imo player actions and player made content (such as sneak attacks in deserted systems) should have priority over automation as much as possible.
9/22/2013,"what people usually fail to understand is the peopleware logistic of big alliances.there is no realistic mechanics that can make easier for a dozen people to take and sustain what a hundred do. that is logic, math, philosophy and what knowledge branch of human thinking you can come up with.if you make it harder for a big alliance to keep territory, you also make it almost impossible to small one. if you make it easy to take, you make it as easy to take back, and if it was easy for a dozen people to take, it is ridiculously easy for a hundred to take back. and probably the dozen people will lose a much more significant part of their assets when the turn tables take place then the big alliance lost in the first battle.there is no logic you can come up with that makes sense so a small group of people can take easy what a lot is holding. there is simply no reason to make it so.if all the people complaining about sov united and gone for it, they would get it sooner than asking game to change so they can. but that is the nature of things, you are complaining sov is hard to take to small corps and you have a small corp exactly because of your inhability to gather a lot of people and coordinate them to achieve what you say it is a matter for a lot of people.that makes me think about a reductio ad absurdum of seeing the guatemala army marching over usa territory after conquering sov all over up to mexico. lolbut there is always thermopylae or pearl harbor to call to. and since the pilgrims and indians we know what happens soon after. lol"

9/22/2013,"impacts to the game:much is said about the bitter vets who control this game, my belief and this is where i welcome input (not trolls) is that many of them have so much isk that they no longer play the game much, and due to the ease of scamming by use of different accounts they get their kicks out of destroying corps and alliances.so what is the impact of the ease in which scams can by carried out using the different accounts to make it impossible to guard against:fleet combatit is my belief that blobbing is also created by this issue, spies are just impossible to stop, anyone can spy if they have multiple accounts, as an fc you assume that from the off you have spies, this means that you every movement is known, that your fleet composition is known, that your fc's are known, that your anchors are known and that when you call targets the enemy logistics know who to rep up. solution, blob to such a degree that it does not matter!and i have had my own personal experience of having the same number of spies in a fleet as loyal people, i found it highly amusing, but quite indicative of the issue facing eve, when 4 out of 8 people were spies and decloaked the fleet just before we launched bombs, that was 50% of the fleet, and i count myself in amoung the 8. if you don't find this a striking testement to the issue then nothing will move you.alliance sizemany people wonder why there are not more good medium sized alliances, well because of the risk of being cleaned out you have two optimum sizes, very small so that you know everyone and are pretty secure in that, or massive huge alliances with vast resources that can laugh of most heists. there is no middle ground in eve, als part of the issue here is supers and titan blobs etc., but taht is outside of the scope of this argument. i have seen a lot of dynamic new alliances get cleaned out and effectively destroyed before they had a chance to make an impact.good new people leave eve i have seen in my time in eve a number of dynamic leader types who were effectively developing their corps and alliances get caught out by this impossible to guard against event, the penny dropped that this could not be prevented in anyway, they realised that eve while showing much promise as a game was fundementally flawed, most give up, or decide to potter along at a lower level in those small entities, but evantually leaving the game. result is that the game stagnates. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
9/22/2013,"solution:all players mush have a single unified account, that they have a tick box that allows them to opt out of enabling people to see their other accounts. the api will deliver the full account details of all their charcters across all their accounts if this tick box is ticked, this enbles people to check the player. of course if peopel refuse to have this checked then it is the choice of the ceo whether to go ahead or not, i would not.ccp will need to police people tryuing to set up more than one unified account, they need to make sure that account transfers are logged and detailed so that they can be part of the assesment.the impact on spyingthis makes spying more of a challenge in which the player will effectively become a spy player against one target, this means they ahve to be carefully targetted, as only so many people would want to do this, this still enables spying, but makes it a full game choice with consequences.the impact on scammingscammng is still possible, it has no impact on contract scams, isk doubling, etc., it makes being a scam player difficult and challenging, because they cannot hide behind an account, they have to actually play within the game to get their target to trust them. if people scam under this system, you have my respect. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"

9/22/2013,"1) your original posts did not answer the question. now you have.2) mag's wasn't trolling.3) how does ccp go about implementing this? what are the consequences then of not opting-in to a unified account system? are you suggesting that ccp forces everyone to have all their accounts unified or receive the ban-hammer? why would i link my accounts, knowing your intentions for having them linked, when, for example, i run my alt accounts through a different email address and just plex them, not giving the alt account a definite connection to the main account that ccp wouldn't waste essential dev man-hours looking into and investigating for not following a unified account system?"
9/22/2013,"you can bypass a ""unified account"" check by...- setting up eve on a separate computer- running an ip scrambler or relay- using two different forms of paymentat best, it will look as if two different people are playing eve. at worst, it will look as if two different people are playing eve from the same house. you would not be able to automatically/mechanically distinguish whether the accounts are playing in tandem or are separate. instead, you would have to observe them... and given than there are ~1.2 to 1.5 accounts per player (someone fact check me on this, this is what i recall)... or ~100 to 250k alt accounts out of a total account population of 500k (20 to 50% of the total subscribers of eve)... i highly doubt that ccp would be able to manually enforce with a staff of 700 (because that is what they currently do with regards to botting and rmt... they manually check and observe over a long period of time to make sure the account is actually guilty of tos violations).and even if you take the extra half step and ask for ccp to ban multiple accounts (because that's where you are totally going with this) you'd run into the same problem."

9/22/2013,"again, as i usually feel like starting my posts, ""people like to complain about everything"".one of the peopleware game mechanics eve has to offer is the rest on trust as the sole means of linking one entity to another.there is absolutely no reason to start putting mechanics in place to make it so you can get hard asurance of people's honesty.lots of what goes on in eve that you cant see in other mmos rely on the feeling of social uncertanty you have. you may talk to me in one char about me in another char or see i talking to myself without knowing what is going on. lots of interesting stuff happens in those situations. not only that, but the situation in which the proof you can give of your entity relation to another entity is the same you can do about the relation of one of your entities to someone else's.this is one aspect that makes individuality really kick in in eve universe. you cant trust someone is someone else, want them or not.it is not only a matter of me telling subject a that i am this and that entity, but one subject a talking to a subject b without my knowledge or consentiment that one entity and another are in fact me.politics run wild on that uncertanty, and the inability of proving you or anyone else is someone else beyond dubt is something that wrecks so many aspects of the game i cant really count them all."
9/22/2013,"what i am suggesting is to make such activity harder and a much greater effort and require real gameplay, it is not to put in place a mechanic to get assurance of honesty, it is in my opinion something required for game balance and ultimately for the continuation of eve, one thing i have noticed since i joined in 2009 is that the game is pretty stagnent, new blood never really gets a look in does it and this issue is one of the major reasons why, based on the power that a large number of older players have in terms of isk and accounts. due to this certain groups have no uncertainty, they have excellent intel on other groups and can attack their very foundations with ease. the key thing for me is to remove part of their power and as such change the way alliances develop, or more accurately the reason why they do not develop...but another aspect that you have to consider is that it is just too easy and there is no defence against it, middle sized entities have to trust their members to try to take a slice of 0.0 and when they do they are really vulnerable as assets being moved or assets put into the field are so easy to take out, either by use of spies for a drop or by stealing them.you may call it a complaint, but i have been playing games since the early 80's, i have designed and run my own game, and in my opinion this game just misses that piece to make it truly great, because in a game you have to play the game, not game the game which is what this structural issue enables. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
9/22/2013,"i had to look back at this previous experience and you pretty much acted the same way then. ignoring questions and calling names.why shouldn't i ask you questions about your idea? you basically want to restrict certain forms of play, with . people will be able to get around of course. not only that, because as ccp encourage scamming, spying, theft etc, they most certainly wouldn't go down the route of banning players for not using a unified account system, because they may wish to partake in a form of play that ccp endorses.then we have to question whether the unified system, would even divulge the information you require. sure it may link accounts, but ccp may deem this information private. or give the option to make it so. you're taking very large leaps of faith that your idea and vision of , is that of ccp's.it's a game, that's all it is, a game. one that thrives on the very things you seem to hate, player driven content. ccp even makes videos about it, the causality trailer springs to mind.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."

9/22/2013,"sometimes i really try to see the logic in which people make some requests, because i want to see the links in their ideas and maybe enjoy them, but anything involving solo activities in mmorpgs is really hard to.ok to have some tutorial or pass time activities soloable, like missions or duels, and such. but changing an entire mechanic of the game to privilege a solo executing activity in a mmo game is really shameful.oh, sov is hard to gain because big alliances get it easier than small corps. the solution is simple: join a big alliance or try to make one. trying to make one is really the best effort for those using that argument, because hopefully they will realise how hard it is to rise even a chaotic big alliance, and how the work being successful has a just reward in the ease it brings to the game for those participating.oh, i want to sit in peace in a place and pvp only with someone i choose to. get a rts or fps and do it all the time you want. as much as ccp make eve a place where people can do ""theirs"" alone in peace, as much the universe will seem unrealistic and alienating.oh, people are not doing what i want them to. well, the mmo part is intended to make that happen, and if you are not happy with that, choose a non-mmo to play. sure there is lots of games you can find eve experience without ""all the people not doing what you want them to, or no one to do what you dont want done"".eve is about corps, alliances, fleets and community, and if you have mechanics backing up the solo activities, you are making the game less, not more."
9/22/2013,"i have made this point as well over in f&i. if the expected loss goes up, it could be balanced by an increase in the expected benefit. thus, the game becomes more exciting and nobody is made worse off."

9/23/2013,if you want to argue my fallacious motivations suggested by the guy trolling this thread you do so elsewhere. do you have any comment on the change i suggested?
9/23/2013,"you mean this?and even if you discount the fact that there's more butthurt in that thread than on the average tailor swift cd, it's still very relevant, because it explains why you are posting what you are. it's the only experience with sov that you have had, and it has effected your perceptions of the mechanic. which, by the way, doesn't disqualify you from talking about the topic, but it certainly does need to be taken into consideration by people who you want to take you seriously. oh, and your idea is just plain bad, and it shows that the person suggesting it has little to no idea what they are talking about, that's my comment. sov sucks. your idea (at least, it's second draft anyway) would make it suck slightly more, and does not address the underlying problems in any way. it's an obvious ""grr, goons""-motivated targeted nerf to something that you personally don't like."

9/23/2013,i already have.
9/23/2013,nah all you've done is make bitter personal attacks and troll.
9/23/2013,"pointing out that your opinion is obviously colored by a failed attempt to take sov is not a personal attack. telling you that your idea is godawful is not a personal attack. and what i am about to tell you, that you clearly have a problem with me and have thus only skimmed what i said and as a result think i'm trolling and haven't already explained perfectly well why your idea is godawful, is not a personal attack. and telling you to get over yourself isn't trolling. it's actually fairly helpful advice in eve. just because you can't take sov (all on your own, what's more) and tell yourself that somehow automated warnings are at fault does not make that a problem for anyone else. sov is broken. yep, has been for years, pretty much since they implemented it, and it has tons of problems. but receiving evemails when your assets are under attack is not among them."
9/23/2013,"you're totally refusing to tell me why its a bad idea... try harder.edit: oh yeah i have never had nor ever wanted to take sov, nor even attempted to take sov therefore i can not have made a failed attempt to take sov.i tried to blow up a customs office and shoot an onlining tcu. how the hell is that trying to take sov :)"
9/23/2013,"and, the only reason you think it's a problem is because you are looking to spread blame for a failed attempt at taking sov. that's it, the end. you are arguing about a non issue, and that's why it's a bad idea."
9/23/2013,"i have never tried to take sov lol. i tried to blow up a onlining goon tcu and a few months ago i shot a customs office. that's hardly trying to take sov. it was more trying to damage some abandoned stuff.when you read words, you need to try to understand them not just fill in the meaning with your own silliness. now tell me why its a bad idea? i'm suspecting you don't know yourself."
9/23/2013,"since you're determined to make this go in circles.non. issue. as in, it's only a problem for you. also, if the two are unrelated, which i highly doubt, their timing is suspect."
9/23/2013,"wow.let me give you a bit of help. if i have an opinion you don't agree with - ""the sky is red"" - then you don't simply say ""its a non issue"", you say ""no, the sky is blue because.... your opinion here"".you see, since we're dealing with opinions, its not sufficient to tell me my opinion is invalid because your opinion negates it. this is the basis of communication and discussion. when you say ""its a non issue"" but you fail to explain why, then you are simply trying to enforce your own opinion on others without any explanation. this shows you lack the ability to properly communicate.so please, if you would, explain why its a non-issue?"
9/23/2013,"heh, no. if you say, ""the sky is red"", i say ""what are you on?"" or ""lay off the sauce"".same thing applies here."
9/23/2013,ok then unless you have something of value to add to the discussion ill simply ignore your ranting on it. have a nice one :)
9/23/2013,"well i believe you should only get a message from the server if your in the same region that something of yours is getting attacked. communication should only travel so far. i can't see that market in a different region, why should i be able to see something getting attacked? but i do believe i should know if something is getting attacked if i'm near it, at least in the same region, that way i can go and defend it. i do believe someone should be able to take a area and control that area, but they must also defend it, even if they don't utilize it at the time. denial of an area is another fun part of the game, hence gate camps :)"
9/23/2013,"i think i see your logic as far as markets and distance...however i can see all contracts all over eve. so, how does that work. in the scheme of things. what i do not understand is why is the big push to punish folks that actually took the initiative and the willingness to take on full time job herding autistic squirrels."

9/23/2013,"classice troll behaviour is to pick a question close to the subject matter and flog it to death, that is my experience with you and i make no apologies for calling you out on it in those threads. but seeing as you asked reasonable questions i will give you the respect of a reply.of course people will try and will get around it, but that is why you need a perma ban threat, not for scamming to make sure you understand that. this is also where we differ, where is it play to use another account with no link at all to your real main and yet use that account to assist the policy and direction and even wallet of your main, that is not play, its using the structural mechanics to enable you to easily infiltrate and then execute.you like many assume that ccp fully endorses scamming, i actually doubt that, you noticed that certain key ccp personal have moved on and both were pro scamming, one in particular did that to make isk when he played and nothing else. also i think it was because it was just too difficult to control, that being said i have no issue with scamming, my issue is simply that the structure of accounts makes it impossible to protect yourself, and that recruitment is a complete lottery. on the other side this makes scamming ultra easy and hardly a challenge. keep thinking i am against scamming, but in my view if someone does it because they get fed up of the ceo, cool, if someone plays as a scammer, cool, but here is the rub, they have to play entirely as a scammer. you say that ccp would not go down the route of banning people for this, well i have become aware of ccp being rather quick to ban people recently without any real explanation.if you had read my suggestion, you would note that i had a tick box option for the player whether to allow this information to be gathered by the api, and that the tick box status would be reported as part of the api, this gives a player the option not to give this data, but i like many others would not accept that person.i make no leap of faith that the developed this way is what ccp wants to do, i hope it is something they will do.i don't hate scamming, it might surprise you to know that i read c&p a lot and i have laughed my head off at psychotic monk, note that he is doing it with that toon (of course he uses the account issue to do it too), but i like it when he uses his main, the fun part was that he actually joined a corp in pirate nation when we were in delve couple years back whose ceo was really bad at security, and when we saw him in this corp we just cracked up, damn if people are not able to check someone like that they deserve it.back to the troll part, it is obvious to me that you did not read what i put up, if you really want to discuss things like this then read the subject matter and digest before posting, otherwise i think you are trolling because trolls just focus on one thing, like you don't like scamming and flog it to death and come up with comments ignoring what was said in the original post, which is what you have done.""but ccp may deem this information private. or give the option to make it so.""my suggestion inlcuded that option, go back and read it! blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"

9/23/2013,"my point regarding that information, was about unified account management. i could have made this clearer, but with your current attitude i'm not sure it would have made a difference.i'm saying they may look upon this information to be private, as in not even include it in the api database. or give you an option if you wish it to be. this would mean even if you had that part of the api checked, it still might not show the info you are after.you're vision of how ccp view scamming and how they would alter to match that vision, isn't something i remotely recognise. you could of course point to posts/articles that back this view you think ccp has, in order to substantiate this stance. but i doubt you will tbh. i have a feeling that what ccp deem as improving the game, is a far cry from your ideals.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
9/23/2013,ccp aren't going to ban thousands of accounts because of a hurte-butte loon.
9/23/2013,"i understood what you were saying there and i repeat it, if the player wishes to keep his characters private then he can chose not to tick the box that enables this check, but the information will be flagged as not showing all accounts. that will work for me, some naive fools may still recruit him, but i won't. so this gives the ceo's of corps what so many want, the ability to assess people for multiple accounts. you may not think that this does not give me the information that i am after, but i would be very happy with that.of course you don't recognise it, but it really depends what you want to do in game, if your entire game is based on sitting next to a gate in rancer setting off smart bombs then you are hardly going to worry about corporate recruitment are you? again i am not knocking that as a style of play, hell i find low sec much more dangerous then 0.0 and i know people who actually know your corp well and respect them. but if you are not able to at least see this issue and think through the impacts of it, then there really is no point in engaging with me, because at the end of the day you are adding nothing to the debate apart from your feelings.i have seen a couple of things that make me believe that ccp is starting to realise this is an issue, one of which was a certain developer who was very pro scamming and only did that as a player move on, followed by the tos clarification, i have also heard of some people getting bans which was very interesting indeed. if you fail to recognise those signs as showing a particular stance by ccp then that is not my issue.of course when one puts forward ideas it is often to ones own benefit, i want to see more alliances getting stuck in to 0.0 and take space and i seriously believe that this is something that will help make that possible, i am not ignoring the other issues, but i feel this one is just as important as super blobs. anyway if ccp does not make this change then they still have a broken game, this is what a friend said to me when i discussed this issue, its says it all:thank you for giving the thread another bump! blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
9/23/2013,"thank you, from you that is a compliment!edit: i know you and i don't think much of each other, however what you said here is interesting, thousands of banned accounts, i guess that confirms the level of multiple account scamming in the game by bitter vets, the type of people who would be prepared to try to get around it. i know you have plenty of contacts in the bitter vet group, so sorta gives the scale of the issue. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
9/23/2013,your habit of spinning vast palaces of conspiracy from the most evanescent threads of gossamer thin fact are what qualify you as a loon. your insistence on making something that by your own account hasn't even affected you into some kind of moral issue make you a hurtte butter.no complements are implied in stating implicit facts.
9/23/2013,"you make a statement, then back off with it, what do you mean by that statement? either you think its thousands or you don't, what is it, and don't hide behind trying to get the thread locked by hurling insults, either you think it will result in thousands of accounts being banned or you have no view and threw in a quick throw away comment.edit: in terms of a compliment i took it as one because of my own opinion of you.edit: i just ralised you said had not affected me, sorry you are wrong, because it is so easy there is certain game play that i would never bother attempting because of this issue, like many i have not been caught because i keep it small and tightly controlled. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
9/23/2013,"no you don't understand it at all. i mean not a part of the api database at all. the same way that your account name, payment details, address etc isn't a part of that database.this would mean the following:if ccp allowed us the option of showing, we would have: person a has 4 accounts, but decides in the account management section he wishes this to remain personal information. when person a gives his full api, it will only show the one account and the up to 3 characters on it. person b has 4 accounts, but he decides in the account management section he wishes to divulge this information. when person b gives his full api, it will show all the linked accounts and each and every character on them.if ccp deemed it personal, we would have: all accounts would show 3 characters only. in other words, it would be of no use to you at all.i have been involved in recruitment in the past and i agree it's not easy. but then that's one of the reasons i love eve. many of it's aspects are not easy, but that doesn't entitle me to certain personal account information. as far as your evidence regarding ccps stance on scamming is concerned, was that it? it was circumstantial at best tbh.devs, well they come and go. tos wording, well yes it changes and gets clarified, always has always will. maybe you could point to the change and why it's changes ccps stance on scamming?as far as these bans you mention are concerned, context and evidence is required.so no still not seeing it, as you haven't provided much in the way of proof to alter that.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
9/23/2013,"but that is not what i am suggesting, what i was asking for was that the api would detail those other accounts and all their characters if ticked and if not ticked would detail the single account and would indicate that the player was not prepared to divulge additional account information. by doing that a ceo can take a decision without being in the dark, some might be persuaded by the awesomeness of the player and his account, others like me would go meh and decline his application.and for me its game information, not personal player information. glad to hear that you have been involved in recruitment so you understand that its not easy, what i don't like is impossible and the account side of things makes it impossible to verify the risk, and the fact that a player has multiple accounts is not personal information in my viewthere was a thread in c&p about the tos started by a member of the shadow cartel and in that someone started talking about some recent bans he was aware of, he intimated that they were as a result of scamming."
9/23/2013,"i know that's not what you are suggesting, but i'm suggesting that may be the case. i'm saying you may think you're entitled to know this info, but ccp may think otherwise. in your view, which may not be ccp's. which is my point.oh and that thread was about someone impersonating someone else. which as far as i'm aware, has always been taboo. in fact, it's not the first time someone has tried to impersonate the big c and come foul of ccp's wrath.not only that, but he also edited wiki pages to show incorrect information. so i can fully understand why ccp updated their tos, to clarify their stance on such matters and banned his ass.but that doesn't help you make your case.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
9/23/2013,"maybe, but it is not personal information as defined by various data protection acts, so i really cannot see them having an issue with it, the issue is whether they could setup a unified account and police it, which is the issue i think. yeah i know what the thread was about, read the blog too, excellent blog by the way. also i have read up fully about this incident and agree with you on ccp's actions.as regards to making a case, i am focussed on the issue which is most problematic to game play and which makes scamming so easy and lethal, i fully expect ccp to do nothing, this says it all doesn't it:"
9/23/2013,"i assumed the 'story line' explanation of why the planets don't move is because we are all flying in 'faster than light' spacecraft, i.e. 'warp drive'. the planets are moving so slowly they seem to be standing still from our perspective. i still wonder why the official explanation of how jump gates works says it uses the gravity of two suns to create an artificial wormhole, but i have only ever seen one sun in every system. it's another minor detail, but how hard could it be to add an extra sun? there's a lot of things about the eve universe that don't reflect the actual physics of space. for example, the way our spacecraft move is a lot more like a submarine than a spaceship. it's as though we are traveling through a fluid medium, and not the virtual vacuum of space. an actual spacecraft would travel more like a brick on ice. you would turn on your propulsion modules, and you would just go faster and faster, nothing would slow you down until you turned your rocket exhaust in the direction of your destination exactly half way through your trip. combat in space would be pretty difficult if not impossible. in the vastness of space, it would be pretty unlikely that two spacecraft would ever be able to pinpoint one another, much less intercept one another. once you located your enemy, they would be gone to who knows where? it would be a lot like shooting down a specific bullet using another bullet in the desert at night. even if you did manage to catch up with another ship, simply turning your ship around so that your rocket exhaust was facing the enemy would do a lot more damage than lasers or bullets or missiles. there's a lot of heat and radiation propelling your ship forwards. cloaking ships would be impossible, since the energy signatures of a ship could be seen clearly from half way across the solar system. even now from earth, we would be able to see the rocket trails from the space shuttle from as far away as jupiter."
9/23/2013,your point about only one sun around to work the jump gate..... you are forgetting about the sun at the other end of the artificial worm hole (at the exit jump gate).jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.
9/23/2013,"settling in a wormhole is kind of the same thing, isn't it?"
9/23/2013,i don't see this as adding anything to the game to be totally honest. it would just take up resources better used almost anywhere else without any real gameplay benefit .
9/23/2013,"i actually like that idea, because it does create a conflict driver and gives people a slice of space which they would want to defend.of course the 0.0 splergelords will hate it and block it, they want you in their mega fleets pressing f1 under 10% tidi and anything that devalues 0.0 by making hs more interesting is a big no no. edit: i think jint is correct, remove item 4. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"

9/23/2013,"i suggested this as a way to 'fix' low-sec. have gambling and pleasure hubs, but only in low-sec space. why only in low-sec? well for one thing high-security space isn't meant to be too comfortable. amarr is a theocratic feudal state, caldari is a fascist corptocracy, and so on. it's a nice, 'safe' nest to start out in, but there should be an incentive to venture further into more dangerous areas. i don't see any of the high sec governments being tolerant of the practice of gambling. low sec should have the feel of the 'frontier', a kind of step away from the safe and settled worlds of the east and into the fortunes of the wild, wild west. frontier 'saloons' with gambling, prostitution, drinking, etc. would reflect that element of danger and adventure, like moe eisley's bar in star wars. gambling is what brought people into the deserts of nevada, and it was the mafia that did it. gambling is just the sort of thing to bring more people into low-sec as well. after all, it's not as though pirates would only be interested in killing each other or shooting anything that moves, they would be living in low-sec for a reason. freedom, ideological differences, lifestyle choices, and of course economic opportunities. as someone has already pointed out, there are already lots of off site gambling sites which use isk and are eve themed. ccp is really missing out on some additional revenue and opportunity here, as well as a potential 'isk sink' to combat the inflation problem."

9/24/2013,it's bad because the sov mechanics are intended to trigger pvp. your idea is aimed at avoiding pvp.
9/24/2013,"i don't see how it would cause less pvp.imo the timers make it possible for the following to occur:(1) goonswarm, currently the biggest and most powerful alliance drops tcu's all over a region. nobody attacks them because they know that once they go into reinforced, in 24 hours they'll have to fight an un-winnable fight against goons who will have the time to gather and prepare. less fights.(2) a powerful allliance like goons has lots of space, more than they can actually use. they hardly go into that space at all. instead of using it they rent it out to other groups. as long as those groups are renting out the space they're not fighting for space. other groups that also rent out space from the same alliance don't fight their neighbor renters because they'll get kicked. less fights.(3) a small roaming gang wants to blap some assets, they know if they try to blap anyone but a small corps or alliances assets that they'll get owned. since most of the space in game is now owned by large alliances, they don't blap stuff. no roaming gangs. less fights."
9/24/2013,"so, if i understand it correctly, you're saying fight against goons are unwinnable, so sov mechanics should be changed so people can take goon sov and destroy their structures without a fight?"
9/24/2013,"that's what i took away from it, yeah. ""please change something i personally dislike, because grr goons!"" (because, god knows that you shouldn't be able to have a victory you earned so long as people dislike you)also, please note how those examples given above are not due to a mechanic, but due to a meta element. cowardice. ccp can't fix cowardice."
9/24/2013,"if you stop to pay close attention, almost everybody asks for changes only when something is of their disliking, and very few people can really ask for changes that improve the game as a whole.all the sov whine since the start is based on the idea that it is a part of the game entitled to anyone, as a ""forceful progression"".i guess it is news to most players that eve is not a game of streamlined progress. it is not because you was piloting a frigate and now you pilot a destroyer that you ""leveled up"".this egocentric idea makes the game what it is, not mechanics. the idea many players have that the game is made to ""armies of one person"" is what brings the problems most people complain about."
9/24/2013,"nah. i'm not at all interested in taking sov. i have played solo since 2003. been in one gang probably for 5 minutes. i don't have nor ever will be in or have an alliance. however i see a problem with the mechanics. so i'm pointing it out. conflict in eve benefits everyone, me, you, all. its what drives the economy. no one wants sims in space which is where goons are heading with their anti-pvp rental program."
9/24/2013,so what makes you an authority on how sov mechanics work or should work then? perhaps people who are dealing with them every day for year(s) know what they're talking about.
9/24/2013,"cool, rally up the troops, and go that way ---------> and create conflict and content. tia."
9/24/2013,"no conflict at all.look up what sovereignity means. no conflict there.look up that there is no reason at all to imply that a small corp deserve sovereignity more than big alliances. there is no reason to say that people have to use the space they conquer. no even in real life it is that way.the whole premisse is based on the assumption i already said, people take that eve is a streamline progression game, and you have the right to enjoy every aspect of the game. eve is a universe kind of game, and it is stated loud everywhere, the sandbox style. they have things that arent supposed to be soloable or such. there is really no argument you can make that imply the inherent right for sov to small corps more or equal to big corps.this flawed assumption that plagues eve community into not evolving. people just stagger in lots of small corps fighting for small things, wanting big things, and blaming the few that understands the principle of the game and seek to create the community in the sense the game always was meant to be.eve would be the cream of the crop if you had dozen huge alliances instead of the huge number of alliances compoosed by half dozen corps of three members. that is why all mechanics involving large scale seem flawed, it is because no one cares to build large scale."
9/24/2013,i don't have to engage in an activity to know a lot about it. been playing eve since 2003. i know how it works.
9/24/2013,"time in service has nothing to do with competence of the subject.i have had quite a few ""vets"" that never left high sec swinging there life time achievement epeen of playing the game for years and not have a clue about the inter workings and the mechanics of nul let alone lo-sec. so, i ask you, how does making a claim that you have actually played the game since 2003, qualify you to point out the things you think are wrong and have the solutions. the only reason i pose this question is that your approach is that of an expert. but the only shred of any proof is some claim that you actually played this game since 2003. your argument is not substantive, it is more based on emotional world view of how you see things, and you really do not like it very much when others disagree."
9/24/2013,"i would point out that the changes i suggested and the mechanics involved are sound and not incorrect.the replies i have been getting have all been emotionally based, they lean towards my motivations (irrelevent), knowledge of mechanics (irrelevent and based on assumptions as to my knowledge) and why its not ""fair"" for big alliances to not receive emails (emotive, irrelevant). almost no attention to whether or not receiving or not receiving emails from the server is a good or bad idea. which is rather unfortunate as that's what this forum is for. suggesting ideas."
9/24/2013,"ccp spitfire wrote: added this here, if you haven't read the sticky please read it. highlighted the parts that seem to be being ignored. please stop the trolling and derailing and focus on the idea."
9/24/2013,i have read it and understand it. also you need to understand what a troll is. and what is being relayed here in this thread is a disagreement to your view. that is not trolling. everyone wants to kneejeck and call someone a troll because they do not align with their way of thinking. which is about the same thing as you calling others stupid for voicing their dislike or opinions to your ideas.

9/24/2013,"sorry if you are so emotionally invested in this, and my tenner was not of an ""attack"" it was merely addressing the issue you had with everyone not liking your idea. just an observation, so chill out francis. now as far as your original post: it comes across as ""the big guys have the resources and are not using it and will not share unless i pay them"" i for some reason seeing this turning back unto the small guy in a big way and this will not help them one bit."
9/24/2013,so explain privateers.
9/24/2013,"i founded privateers as a corporation. invited anyone and everyone who wanted to join to join and go about their business of killing the alliances. i handed it over to surreptitious though as i had to stop playing eve so i could concentrate on studies. they then formed the privateer alliance.i'm not at all emotionally invested in anything. i proposed an idea and rather than discuss the idea, i get 3 pages of stupid comments from people that really can't explain why its a bad idea but insist it is or like yourself, decide to cross examine me on my personal motivations, prior corporation employment and sincerity.i have better things to do than lie about how i like to play eve."
9/24/2013,"this post may have been also overlook for some time.like you i am a person of management, and i find really annoying to manage business in a ""business like way"" using the tools intended for that task. that is why i employ alts for said tasks.one thing i coupled with that is the ability to have alts in each major trade hub doing trade stuff and managing stuff, and using external websites to give intel to other people.i assume that corporation management is something that will be at the bottom of the priority list because the players themselves dont use that, only a few of us. the majority are in different points of view, business, industrial, etc, but asking for the same things: ships, sov things, skill training, and so on.you have to keep on mind that the development of eve has shown a sinuous path until now, and each expansion bad reception leads to another skew towards another goal. first you have an expansion about ships, people complain that ships arent the only problem, then you have expansion about content, then people complain that content is not the issue, then you have an expantion about pvp, people complain that pvp is not the issue, then you have an expansion intended to create an amazing integration plan with dust, and people dismiss it as ""dress up play expansion"" so we are back to ships and content.eve devs are concerned too much to what players want, but most players have no clue about what is in the realm of game mechanics and what is the realm of l2p, so too much effort of devs is spend in fixing what is not broken, and laying down ground signs for stupid people to find what they claim not existent until it is flashing over the ui.they most likely do not have time to sit over aspects of the game few people use or are inclined to learn to."
9/24/2013,i am mostly asking for a cleanup of the corporation management section and a return to the usefulness of contracts. the former being something that is absolutely necessary because as it is it is too easy for a corp to fall victim to a permissions loophole due to bad programming. the latter being something that would help increase the flow of goods between people and therefore strengthen the economy of eve itself. the rest is just ideas of crap you could jam into it to make it a full expansion. i'd settle with a minor patch!
9/24/2013,"when i was in the csm, this was one of the issues i pushed for, and i believe it's part of the reason we have all the discussion of pos mechanics revamping (another thing which was in dire need of a change). when we had the questions about the one thing we'd change, i said the whole corporation mechanic (leadership, poses, wardecs, roles, etc).i supported it then, and i still do now. all aspects of corporations need work, as they're one of the hinge-points of this game (unlike fw and exploration, which are still valuable but not necessary or pertinent to the majority of the playerbase."
9/24/2013,"industrialists are not left behind by ccp, they are left behind ones by the others.the big difference between what evolves in warfare and what evolves in industry is the approach players have to each aspect. most industrial pilots sit back, do what is there to be done and complain about what is not there.warfare pilots on the other hand go active and develop ways to use what the game have to their ends.it is logical that the approach from warfare pilots renders them more attention, and more specific demands.industrialists are usually not fierce and cunning about what they do, and they want just that, easy, profitable or whatever ways laid down by mechanics.the is not really a huge abyss between mechanics for combat and for industry. the difference is that industry is only used as it is showed to, rather than innovative and inventive (yes, those two are different things) ways warfare is daily sought to be done.it is time for industrialists to start thinking like strategists and activelly bringing industry to the spotlight, and stop asking for the spotlight to be lit over them."

9/24/2013,"... because in real life ....i had the lols.yeah, because in real life one country goes to the un and formalize a war declaration. lolok. i admit that present wardec system is a joke, and one thing i agree to the ""in real life"" argument, that it is a little insane that lets say the caldari state would allow people to blow themselves up right beside the ""town hall"". it is simply not very realistic that you can make war on hisec, and that brings the idea that the only reason wardecs exist is to find ways for people to do pvp alone in peace with only people they want, which is at the same time a turn off on the verge to go to low and null sec, and a turn off for a lot of new players.in this case i think war dec should be put aside altogether and leave it to a simple set said corp to low standing and let people go to areas where they can blow themselves up. that solves a lot of problems and sure will make a lot of new players join the game and stay in the game.population of hisec will most likely always be majority, but wardecs, higest valued ore by qty/price ratio and the certanty of any action being bailed out by some npc rat bashing is a bit overkill if the idea is to keep the hisec population all happy.the moment you cannot blow people up in hisec, and mining isnt that profitable, people will seek places to do it. right now the best place to do it is in hisec, and ccp seems to enjoy it so you have everything being made easy to be done in hisec."
9/24/2013,"so to recap:the issue is that there are a number of players who play eve for a totally different game... its not about spaceships for them... but the meta game of stealing stuff and ruining corps and causing havoc for others. they are very destructive in terms of the game in my opinion, making the development of a corp or alliance very difficult because you can be sure to have one of these in your corp or alliance, they will spy, organise hot drops and clean you out, militarily you have no chance, because they have greater numbers and huge capital fleets, you on the other hand are not even safe shooting a poco in secret, there is no secret unless you keep it so small and then your firepower is not enough. this is the impact on the game at a strateguic level.so i suggested a way to reduce this impact, unfied accounts with a ban penalty for trying to get around this, of course the question is whether ccp would be able to do this.i have one member of the csm reply, malcanis and his reply is revealing, he talks about thousands of accounts being banned until he realises what a whooper he made and tries to bluster around it. think abou it, he is a 0.0 player who moves within the circle of players that control 0.0, he owes his position on the csm to those people voting him as an alternative, he is active on the eve forums and external eve forums. everything he says is to nerf hs and push people to 0.0. and here he details the scale of it unintentionally.my feeling was that there was a significant number of old players who were scamming behind multiple accounts, thousands of accounts in fact, and i am grateful to malcannis for confirming to me what i suspected, even though that was not what he intended.as for his comment about being butt hurt, of course i am, it is only just recently i worked out the scale of this issue and its impact and its right up there with super cap blobs and the sov system. anyway no point in flogging this to death, so back to playing watching and waiting, the fun part is that the initiaive are now in my operational area, so i can shoot some of malcanis's scrubs, yay!!! blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
9/24/2013,"still not an argument, just a ""i want it because i like it and whatever what other people think"" line of speech.bottom line is:mmorpgs are supposed to rely on individuality of entities, not on individuality of people. when you start making things mechanically different for entities because they have the same irl holder, things start to get messey. all the side-kick account thing for example is border-line gameplay interferent, but still not.kasenumi for new eden is one person, and lets say jane doe is another. when you start putting mechanics in place that change jane doe's new eden life in the function of she being kasenumi ""alt"", you are putting in place gameplay interference, which will lead to ""paid"" advantages beyond what is already untolerable to many as multiboxing.imagine if multiboxing was coupled with mechanics leading to ingame resources directed to facilitate anything to entities of the same holder. it is already enough that entities of the same holder bear that advantage, bearing the same holder."
9/24/2013,"so your concept is trust the player to play as the individual character, rather naive and trusting isn't it? but in truth that person can be handled by refusing to allow that data to be included in the api character search, so no issue and the ceo gets the ability to see that he does in fact run other accounts and has the choice to say, nah, too much of a security risk.as for: actually i made a full argument about it in this thread, and those that don't like it are either pirates or 0.0 people who of course won't like it for obvious reasons, and you cannot look at these forums as giving any real backing or not, because the forums are heavily slanted towards the two player types i just mentioned, those that would most probably agree with my suggestion don't tend to post on eve forums because they see no point in it, having had multiple ""where on the doll did that nasty man touch you"" type comments, proves nothing... blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
9/24/2013,"there is no mandatory reason to have accounts linked because there is no reason for such asurance either in a positive way for yourself, or in a mandatory way. you are not making any argument towards a real reason. your argument is based on what you would like for yourself, not in something that would actually make the game better as a whole. that is what it boils down to.it is not naive, nor trust, it is to accept the way things are.if we start making room for linked entities in the game, you start really to employ the pay to win strategy, once you have ways to link and identify accounts, it is the start. more inventive ways can be put in place to aggravate this into advantages.there will be no disadvantage. i can have in less than 2 hours in the average, and in less than 30 mins in the right times of the day, a eletronic credit card, mobile internet perfectly good to play once i used my broadband to download, and voila, if i dont want to have my accounts linked and face the downsides of it, i can, and if i want to have them linked to take the advantages of it, i can. so linking accounts can only be to enjoy the advantages it will bring, and no downside of mandatory link can be really enforced unless you are a softcore player who wont be bothered to avoid them.there is one player that showed this method employed to play with multiple trial accounts that should not be played ""in bulk"". when something cannot be enforced, it cannot be mandatory just for the sake of appearance.so i can only see this as an effort to mess up the game into something unrealistic.the thing is, for me, you do business with aakiwa as her, and with jane doe as her, you wont need for any reason to do business with either based on the asurance that they belong to one single account holder. i am not saying this is enough to trust, i am saying more than this make the game less."
9/24/2013,"the argument you made is basically with your self, you can sit there rocking back forth swearing you are tinkerbell. but it does not prove out the argument that it is valid."
9/24/2013,"i have laid out quite clearly why it would benefit the game, that you are incapable of seeing it is not my issue, the reason are quite clear, let me repeat it for you:and this is made so easy due to the inability to check back on multiple accounts, therefore corp scams and infiltration are rampent within the game and there is no way to protect yourself against this in game, this then distorts the game in a number of ways that are quite obvious if you look or have the wit to see it. the game is much less for this and the fact that spying is so damn easy, all laid out in page 1 of this thread.and of course i would like it, eve is currently meta gamers kitty online, it is so easy for them they don't have to even try much, did you see that word, try, the steps you explained to get around it take effort, many people would not bother, a large group will, but like anything they will make mistakes, yes the question is whether ccp have it in them to check back on this, and yes its highly unlikely, but if it removes at least a number of them its a start, if you think that i see it as a complete way to solve the issue it is not, its just like fighting bots, it takes effort.""its just the way things are"" defeatist rubbish... blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
9/24/2013,"ezslider, sticks and stones, the only argument i was having with my self was whether to continue to play eve and also how i would play based on this issue, my original plan was of course to go for sov, but now i have decided to have some fun with the assets i had built up, it is a great long term game and is hard, except for corp thieves and infiltrators (its too easy for them), i tend to like to play hard games, but if the game involves a structural weakness that makes it too hard and you have no way to deal with it in game then that is akin to head butting a wall or trying the same thing again and again expecting a different result. i play for a challenge, not to be a patsy for some inadequate who can only succeed by meta gaming, therefore the high level strategic game is toast for me and its now just blast in small ships for small gang combat. i have to say i wish i had worked this out earlier, but as i have a highly skilled character focussed on sub caps i did not waste effort training something big and shiny to have that meta gamed by certain people, i am not too impacted.thanks for all the fish, but this is my last post on this thread, i said what i needed to say, and if people have a vested interest in not seeing this or don't get it then more fool them. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"

9/24/2013,continuing the call for dialogue. when will there be a response?
9/24/2013,"as you all know goonswarm has spread like a virus across eve online. i don't claim to know the history of it, but what i do see is a new face upon eve online. when i returned to eve it was not the same universe that i had left behind. it's a new verse that is plagued by a powerful syndicate that has spread to the roots of every null sec corp. the goons started when a corporation called band of brothers started using an exploit to amass a fleet and lag out players so bad that they couldn't activate their weapons, undock or warp out when they needed to. they were bent on dominating the game from the get go, and built swarms of newbie ships to take out carriers. the news announcement came that a new organization started to join the fight against band of brothers. goonswarm federation had joined forces with iron to fight bob off using the same battletactics. they formed massive swarm battles that lag up the server so bad that ccp had to fix the server nodesgoons now control 100% of the north. their headquarters ju-owq and vfk are old sites that have outposts that predate player outposts. these systems have perma level 5 industry and can be used to make an alliance strong. with this region and 300 or better active players you could control the region well enough to defend it. with 1000 people you could turn the tide of the game. this region used to be populated by carebears who ruled it with an iron fist. are you going to let goons take over the game? they claim the game will go bankrupt and servers will close by december. maybe they will succeed and get enough people to quit to shut down eve for good. from what i heard the guy who runs it is a lawyer who wanted to sue the ccp. these players all started right around the time of the plex. the plex was new and that meant people could start alt accounts with isk they amassed from industry, t2 bpos. they bought plexes for prices like 250m. being able to amass trial accounts and plex them meant that they could devise a master scheme to rule the eve universe. it meant they could hack the eve servers and not have to worry about loosing their account, because it was just a plex. it meant they could be as rude and mean to people as they have many accounts and it doesn't matter. the free to play plex changed the game. it changed the people who play it as well. today goonswarm is spread all across the map in null sec. they rule the nullsec map carefully using infiltration and military tactics and psychological warfare. they take wings of their corp mates and start corps for holding soverign space. they then recruit and decieve a group of players into a corp under goon control. if you want into a null sec corp then you've got to hand them your api. the api is one of their best spy tools, and in the hands of a goon your api is their weapon.the game breaker --- goonswarm federation the goons are guarding the most profitable regions of the game. they now have taken leadership roles in many of the null sec organizations and alliances. they have installed so many alt accounts all over eve. be warned, the goons use real military style psychological warfare against the players of eve. the style and type they use varies with the individual target. the infiltrator - you may have them in your corperation or alliance playing for a leadership role already. know what to look for. a goon recruiter will troll away the good recruits while installing more swarm into your corp. the sov breaker-a diplomat, alliance or corp leader who is acting as a leader to keep a group of people busy. they'll try to keep an alliance or corp thinking they don't need industry, just pvp. they'll get players to stay in their base and buy ships and break their bank before they get powerful enough to do some damage. to defeat goons you need an alliance whose ready to supply between 200 and 500 ships including cruisers .when you get enough people ready to skrimish in cruisers and frigates you can get people who fly bigger ships. most of the older players get singled out , broken and shredded into nothing unless they can plex up different accounts to keep on the down low. it's rude to ask an old player for their api. it's also not as secure as they say it is. someone checked my api without even leaving a single log. a rich lawyer is someone who knows what real goons are like and they know how to get people who can hack computers and worse, they can be dangerous people too. the truth is i don't wanna see a corp like that ruling the game. it's got me flamed up something fierce. so pardon me while i burst into flames. i need 1000 ships to alter the course of the game. so if you're still interested in playing then come rise above the rest. go tickle syndicate in the west and you'll see some of the best. go to curse and you'll see some of the worst.the north offers up the berth of the eve economy and it should be harnessed by the best people. build up your connections, don't let yourself be harassed. let the goons burn for their actions."

9/25/2013,"when i first came to asia i saw people driving and i thought to myself how this people can drive in this way. it is chaotic to say the better.when i bought my car, i tried to drive like we do in america, that lead inexorably to fender benders to say the better. loli then started to immerse myself in other aspects of the culture of the country, without necessary links with driving itself, and that made me realise why and how people drive the way they do. and i understood how things work.the argument that you dont need to experience things to know about them always shows up, and always amazes me, because remind myself how many times i fell for its grasp.communities have always mechanics that are in place because of the colective ways, despite any effort of one entity to change them. this is one thing devs and players have to have in mind, the game is not property of ccp, the real life vehicles which support it are, and the game is not made by players, the dynamics in which it changes are.that is the main problem people cant see before they experience things: there are ""ghost mechanics"" in every game, the mechanics that take place not because devs put it there, but because players will make them so no matter what.any change in the sov mechanics is just change in the way things are done, not in the way things are, and regardless of how they must be done, they will soon get back to what they are.as soon as there is no automatic way to do something, there will be a market for people to take care of that. as soon as data is not gathered by automatae, there will be market for people to gather it. and soon things are just the way they were before.that is what experience makes you understand, and observation added to theory fails to show.almost all things ""wrong"" in eve are wrong because people make them wrong, not because the system is wrong."
9/25/2013,"i understand what you are saying but eve is supposed to be about sandbox and player made emergent content. thats not possible if the server prevents players from creative play.when there is only a single method of doing something, such as colonising space then the mechanics are to blame.currently destroying anything owned by an alliance requires that you shoot it, reinforce it, wait for the thing to come out of reinforce. meet up with the alerted alliance at the chosen time and fight them. then destroy it.this happens because the server, not the players, alert the owner. its 100% guaranteed and there is no player choice or way to play this part of the game differently. throughout history we find stories of imaginative strategic moves won wars and battles against superior foes and often they are usually the most celebrated; where tactics which were dynamic, unexpected, new and innovative were tried and succeeded. if every battle was forewarned and everyone smaller had to line up like musketeers and duke it out like they do in eve then our history would be pretty bland and very much like it is in sov warfare in eve."
9/25/2013,"so you're arguing for a change in mechanics you have never experienced in order to benefit a group of people you have never, and will never be a part of.and you think lack of knowledge of the mechanics you are trying to change shouldn't count against you."
9/25/2013,"point out where, in the proposal i made there is any indication that i lack knowledge regarding the mechanic i suggested to be changed.you don't have to be an expert on every facet of sov to suggest that players should be the reporter of an attack rather than the server. i spend a lot of time in null and conflict is beneficial to me as we'll as everyone else. player made content and sandbox > server enforced content."
9/25/2013,"again, no arguments there.an iliterate stating that 2 plus 2 equals 4 in decimal system is right, despite who this person is.a double nobel in math with doctorates and weekly papers published in math respected journals that states 2 plus 2 equals 5 in decimal system is wrong, no matter what.your experience, expectations, hopes or paradigms about the game are not arguments to sustain an idea you postulate in a discussion. that is the main issue.there is no reason whatsoever that imply the need for such thing, and despite the personal likes or dislikes, there is no reasoning in your idea. that is what it lacks.i can see what this can be, and i can see what it cant, but regardless, there is no need.the game needs is the colective of players, not the needs of all players, and that is the reason almost all suggestions are not implemented. you have to think about the idea as a whoie, not as what it can do for one side, dismissing what it demands for other sides and what it changes for other sides.and the way this argument has been conducted by you is another reason. for the sake of realism and immersion one entity must be one entity, because people are almost always unable to follow strict ideas without emotional involvement and personal judgement.if you know a honest industrialist is also a pirate, that would most likely change what you consider from the industrialist and/or the pirate. if most people cant even discuss ideas in a forum other people are represented by their avatars, and regardless having no idea who the person is, still able to state things as if they were true, what good it is to be able or obligated to have your personal identity as an ingame information.this only leads to one outcome: make things better for a few at the expense of making it worse for many."
9/25/2013,"well that is your opinion, and your simplistic and childish 2 + 2 = 4 example really does not cover the issue at all. the reasoning i have come out with after my first two posts is clear and precise, you however are refusing to see it, most likely due to the fact that you have multiple scamming accounts and what i have proposed impacts you. only ccp could really prove or disprove this, as only they have the data and even then that data would have to be picked through, processed and finally read. your reply to me is on the basis of what you feel, who is the many, is the many all those people who run scam accounts, then if so its really funny.as for benefitting the few and hurting the many,the current situation as is benefits a certain type of player, the issue is that it adds to the imbalance around force projection, i can quite understand why players who benefit from this would not want it ended, it enables them to have fun and put forward their superiority with little risk and means that they don't have to grind. at the moment it meets the classic definition of benefitting a few and worse for the many, except perhaps that there are so many people doing this, which is why my example of a fleet with 50% spies was so amusing.did i ever say give the real player name, no, i was after a designated main account, in truth people who have an industry side and a pirate side would have no issue if joining a pirate corp, its logical after all, turn it around and his industrial toon joining a industry corp with a pirate main, some corps may well accept him, but if they saw that the recruit was in pl with another character and that the pirate corp was hot dropping, they would of course think very hard about it. at that point it comes back to them sorting it out between them.you seem to think naively that people can be trusted to role play in this game when the role playing side of this game is so limited and looked down on by most players, thats so naive you should be blushing with embarrasment, but you most probably can't even see that. your entire argument is based around people being able to role play their toons, in a game that very few people role play, frankly your argument does not hold water.and should i mention that ncdot. titan loss? blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"

9/26/2013,"exactly. i mean, i like the current concept of building titles, but it always feels like half the things i add don't do anything unless i add even more, and next thing you know the guy is a director just to perform a simple task!while an expansion that focuses on business would strengthen eve for ages to come, i understand that people seem to feel that re-balancing the dominix, only to undo the rebalance not even 3 months later is a better use of time and resources. look, at the moment i'd settle for a simple patch to at the very least do the following:1) add tooltips to contracts2) make it so contracts assigned to corps can only be accepted by people with the ""contract manager"" permission3) make it so a pos can be set as a person's base (instead of forcing us to give permissions to""other"" facilities, which has the side effect of they gain those at every base that is not hq or where they are based at).prob gonna edit op to clean it up a bit. thoughts were a touch unorganized, but at least everyone seems to get the gist."
9/26/2013,"it would be nice to have more people into the corporation thing. but the push towards all the combat and content take the focus away.it would help if corporation management mechanics were to have a more present role in other aspects of eve, but that also will be frowned upon by many.however, it would be nice to have real business missions and not ""glorified courier"" missions.corporation management today is something only a couple people need among hundreds, maybe thousands even. if corporation management were to have a more central importance also in middle management, then it would have more focus.maybe, and this a big maybe, unite under management category corporation, sov and trade skills. it would help to have some functionality added to cq or ship hangar more focused on management. the aspects of market and corporation management that merge really added, like stock markets or corporation values other than how many ships they kill or have destroyed. stuff like that.even have into management conditions that change the other aspects, like missions that are only available to corps that ceo has a given skill to a level, or change the prices to wardec as much as the allies in the funcion of a corp management skill.i myself see this from the point of view that i can have alts with trade and corp skills enough to do all that is possible without really having to dedicate a main account char to that goal at all. that sounds to me like an underdeveloped aspect of the game for that reason alone."
9/26/2013,"and only one person needs to be the king/president/dictator. yet his actions affect millions. your not seeing the big picture. while we would be changing something only 5% or so of the players would ever see/use, it would affect the way permissions are distributed to 95% of players. furthermore look at red/black/blue frog. an improvement to contracts and permissions would improve their business and therefore improve the ease at which the rest of eve could use their logistics service. look at the big picture, if you are able to make money easier, then you have more money. if you have more money, you are more likely to buy more food from mcdonalds during lunch instead of packing some mac and cheese from the night before. if you--and by ""you"" i mean the average person--buy more from mcdonalds then mcdonalds has more money and a higher demand for their goods. they then proceed to hire more employees and buy more food ingredients from various farms. farmer joe can finally afford that new tractor with this increase in income. his purchase funds the company that makes the tractors which allows them to hire more employees. in addition his tractor will need fuel and service, etc etc.point is, the easier it is to spend and receive money, the faster it circulates, the faster it circulates the stronger the economy, the stronger the economy the better the financial state of the average person, the better the financial state of the average person the happier they are. also, kind of on that same note of real missions rather than ""glorified courier missions,"" sub-contracting missions to other players might not be a bad idea. if i could contract people to do my epic arcs, and ten pay them a large cut of it, we'd both be happy. ^.^ just an idea for a kind of contract."
9/26/2013,"usually people dont like big picture posts so i go very careful with those, but you seem like someone with no fear to read.i see the big picture, and i see what you mean, and i see the problem the problem.once you have this kind of resource available in eve, it stops being on the reach for everyone, and stops even the illusion of that. if people glorify the posts with one line and the quick joke over serious issues, what to say about a situation in which the person is not only the ship and the fit flown, the fleet the person is in, or a colective of ships and fits, but also the corporation they belong. it adds a layer of complexity people are not kind to accept.the most fearful situation to the status quo in eve is the situation where a person can have something as powerful as a weapon but it is not under the control of a math formula or a ""fit of the week"".i see nothing wrong with dictatorship or general facism, maybe because i am not north american, and i know that it can work under certain circunstances, and that is another fearful fact for people. what if to rise a corp that on top of being as military and politically powerful, has this power magnified by a regimen like, lets say, national socialist germany. people fear that sort of thing, and despite the existance of powers beyond the ships and equips, the lack of corporative power still gives the illusion it does not have power. what if this changes and corporation management skills become something to change tides in wars, then you add something people are not likely to understand, judge and follow.i see the beauty of such powers spreading and some armies destroyed even before undocking, but eve crowd is not likely to accept that so fast."
9/26/2013,"not adding anything new. cleaning up the ui. the ""contract manager"" permission does not allow management of contracts assigned to corp, because everyone has the ability to do that. this is stupid because there is no method for controlling who gets what kind of contract, or who can touch what. its crap liek that which leads to alliances with holding corps, which is a band-aid for the problem. it allows people to use the corp wallet to accept contracts, which, by having wallet access they could already do by simply withdrawing and then buying it with ""their"" (the corp's) money. the permissions in eve for corp management are redundant and ********. this is my second toon (been playing since 2009) and i don;t remember them ever being ""clean"" enough to make sense. the current setup allows exploitation due to bad programming. ccp is against exploiting bad programming, want proof? they posted a big threat about not sitting inside a force-field with your drones assigned to someone else, because ti took advantage of bad programming. there is a clear difference between corporate espionage and taking advantage of a system that was broken to begin with. also, as far as dictatorships and structure go. i don't care. i just want the ability to choose my structure like ccp originally intended with their now faded dream of corp management. i do not like being forced into one way or another. all structures have their pros and cons. there are advantages to dictatorships, and advantages to democracies, just as their are advantages to shield tanking, and advantages to armor tanking. their are advantages to everything in eve, because it is all about choice..... except when it comes to corp management."

9/26/2013,"yep, you are boned."
9/26/2013,"i always like how people who know nothing about wars want to coral the fight into predetermined fixtures.and the poster that posted this gem...""in this case i think war dec should be put aside altogether and leave it to a simple set said corp to low standing and let people go to areas where they can blow themselves up. that solves a lot of problems and sure will make a lot of new players join the game and stay in the game.""wow.. just wow. i found my next target."

9/26/2013,"@dracvladyou seriously put a bounty on this alt because...?111,111 isk hahahaha"
9/26/2013,"111k is not a significant value, i know, but this is about the kind of action, not about how much is the value. i would expect such actions, afterall, given the line of arguments you presented, this or wardec would be eventually around.what does that accomplish ? that just accomplish here the dismissal of your argument as it shows the kind of things are to come. in the game shows that my alt had someone bothering enough to put the bounty, regardless of the lack of reason or ultimate outcome besides that stamp. and for me, it shows a lot of how your mind works. besides that, nothing changes.that is exactly why this ""idea"" of yours cannot help the community as a whole. because of people with that kind of mind.what good to your argument you think you do by placing bounties on my alts ?more to the point, what you think that will happen ? people will try to kill me for the bounty ?as with your idea, there is a side you dont really understand. for people who have no idea how the game works, features like that are useless, and for people who knows how the game works, it is simply one more aspect to take advantage from those who dont.you may place a bounty on all my alts if you want, and i activate one of my clones in a place no one is at a given time, but before that i get my own alts there to collect the bounty. you see what i mean ? features linking accounts ingame are just ways to enhance the already advantageous position of a multiple entity holder. nothing else. it makes the disproportion of advantage from people with one account to people with multiple accounts greater and greater, and if it is already a turn down for a lot of people, imagine if you add one more powerful feature to benefit only the multiple account holders ?"

9/26/2013,"there is an old knowledge, as old as ancient greece, in oratory and argumentation techniques, the scarecrow fallacy. you employ misleading constructs to make in your words someone or something into what you need it to be to valid your argument, and then attack that idea and not the real one. that is what you have been doing in all your responses and actions.thanks btw, i was wanting to test out the new bounty system to avoid doing what you and your protegee from the other topic are, talking about something you dont know how it works or how it impacts the game as a whole. now i know how the new rules of bounty work and i can know if people talking about it are talking serious issues or just garbage like the sov claims you so fiercy ""defend"".here i am talking about you action of placing a bounty on my char because of a forum post, i am talking about your argumentative ways, and i am talking about the thoughts you might have had while formulating your arguments, i am not talking about your person. that is the difference. when you talk about people you are not making an argument, because talking about people is talking about feelings, not facts.what it all boils down to is the way you think you are argumenting when you are not. my corporation descriptions means that no one besides people of my familiy or considered as such takes part on that corporation, it has nothing to do with trust, it has to do with the fact that only my brother and a friend can put members in the corp. i can trust anyone any extent and have this useless account link you speak of, that wont allow other people to join this corporation. what you said has nothing to do with what is written in my corp description. you are misleading the meaning of the words to make your point.second, account links have nothing to do with trust. you can perfectly take steps to not link accounts you dont want linked whatever way it is used to make the link, voluntary or otherwise. if it becomes mandatory, the ammount of effort it is placed to enforce this measure is the ammount of skill demanded from people to bypass it, making it incresingly a discriminatory fact towards the less experienced, less powerful or less effort employing players.that is what you try to silently dismiss all the time. you talk about trust, and your actions placing bounty into a forum char, talking about descriptions speaking one thing you say another just show how the meaning what is the idea of trust and honesty you hold.you may respond or not, i really dont care, because i dont come to forums and i dont log into the game to talk to one person about people or about personal things. i am here exposing a idea, not myself. my idea is not about you, or anyone, is about the game as a whole, and anyone who pick it up to respond or enhance, i welcome it. anything else, i am prepared for, otherwise i would be here.that is the whole problem with the way things were exposed in this post and the thing you dare not to talk about, it is the game, the community, the general, the anyone. the mechanics and resources of the game are to any player, all players and the conservation of the game. when we start to put mechanics in place for one player, a group of players you are inherently damaging the game for everyone. that is what this and the sov idea i argument against have in common, they are ideas to put something in place that has no effect over the thing they are being directed to, but can be used to a miriad of other things that presently are doing fine or are not as damaged as they will be with that ideas in place. statement to which you never address."

9/26/2013,"yup, people like one line answers always. i have a couple then:- first, semantics: if you have something to tell you something without doubt it is not trust you get, it is insurance.- you can fake the absense of link between accounts you dont want to, so it is not a fail safe negative method.- for a number of reasons you can indeed fake relation between accounts not linked, so no fail safe positive method also.- still no need for anything else than a mail or im to verify if an account does belong to the same person.only for that there is no reason to say this is a feature that takes precedence to any of the other garbage people ask in this foruns, what to say about the genuine issues.i dont really need to write all that, as you dont need to place bounties on my chars. the thing i did is to show you how i there is not one drop of sense in placing that bounty, and i cant see how a person can find the bounty or the word wanted in portrait funny. i do had fun playing blowing alt frigates a couple times, and wandering around with that bounty with people not even bothering to talk about that. that i found particulary fun.i also had lots of fun showing that to people and throwing some picant jokes about the kind of people that does such a thing.beyond that, nothing more than the 4 lines above to dismiss your opening."
9/26/2013,"now that was a better answer, in the thread i did try to say that it was not the complete answer due to reasons you have detailed here, first of all people can get around it, however this is the rub, how many people will keep going to that effort, and you were right it meant that less dedicated people would not be able to spy giving an advantage to those that had the isk and accounts to do so, but remember that many lower level players cannot get into the higher echolons of the cfc or even get into pl, ncdot etal, they have to have a certain level to do so, for pl they have to spend a long time in the training alliance. but there is a risk to the high isk/multiple account players continued playing of the game if caught which had to be carefully weighed up by that old player, could he risk losing those very old accounts with titans and supers. it is not a complete insurance against this, but it reduces the pure scale of this issue, which makes the game harder, which is what i enjoy, also it requires effort on the part of ccp, which going on past events like offensive names and botting is highly unlikely. so while i had a blast at suggesting this as a way to deal with it, i am not some sort of starry eyed fanatsist that thinks its the full deal, far from it, most things in life take effort and ccp are unlikely to do that unless they have statistics that give the ease of corp infiltration as the main reason for many people to leave and they get worried about the lack of growth.about the bounty, that was only the second time i had ever applied a bounty, and the first was on a player that was an fc and was designed to enable me to calculate the way it worked, to be honest the notifications get a bit wearing after a while. and understand that the bounty was placed on you to expose your lack of knowledge of the mechanics, hence the comment about the big wanted sign taking up 15% of the picture. i have seen numerous people get really upset about that and it does not bother me one bit, but i said that as i wanted you to blow up a ship or two. this is not a dig at you, just an explanation of my actions. yes it is childish i agree, but this game allows us to be childish at times, even though my use was hard and cold, though it still made me laugh at one point. i noticed that you are posting a lot on the forums, well people don't war dec me because i am not tied to hs. but you are, the way you have set up to avoid them works and good luck to you and to your business too, just be careful though commenting as you do, as some people can get very vindictive in this game. i do get the impression you are a returning player, so you most probably understand that.as i said i have moved on from this, i have changed my game objectives because of it, before i wanted to carve out muy own sov in an alliance in which i was one of the leaders and had built up assets to do that, but as this will not change i have changed focus which is now to have fun with those assets at an individual level.i wish you luck in the game and have fun. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
9/26/2013,"some points i always see people complaining about are ""sumus supra"" around here.you have to keep in mind that it is not only the sub money that drives the financial force in eve, and you are wrong to think that because you have a couple alts you are a mega funding source for ccp. if ccp does its job, they know that every human player is important not only in the function of how many alts paid, but also how many plex bought and how many other people play because they play. from the corporative point of view it is better to have at one moment 100 one account players than 20 5 account players, reason being that the future player base expansion is a function of how many people are playing, not how many accounts are being paid. that invalidates the idea that the game have to in any way benefit people in the function of having alts they will ""terminate"". attracting a new crowd to the game intersted in other things is better than keeping people bearing multiple accounts just to mine afk or one man ganking army.then you have to think in the sense of engineering. it is way better to the financial status, to the game, and to the general use and support that most of the players be casual players. a player pays the same, and not as much money as hours playing, so it is financially more taxing to the system the player that pays x and play 10 hours a day than the player that pays the same x and play just 2 hours a day. in some sense, deppending on the player base, it would be impossible to have all sub players playing at the same time. there is no reason to assume that it is better for the game, for ccp or for anything to priviledge players that keep logged all day in detriment to the players that log, do some 2 hours of pew pew and log off.added to that is the infinite number of people that would love to play eve just as a sci fi second life. you cannot say that it would be detrimental to the game, because franky, the dress up folks would pay for a better game for everyone and not interfere with the warfare and industry while spending hours molding and making up their chars in the creator that actually doesnt load the network as much. even if there were station social interaction, this could be done in an entirely different network that would not interfere with the so called ""serious player"".but despite all that, people insist in think that because they are playing a long time, have a lot of alts and spend half the day logged in eve, the game must represent their interests.all the things mentioned as turn offs by people in the posts are either options people can avoid if they want, or no interference with their desired gameplay, or nothing but cosmetic changes. but still, people rise the straw man of the ""wowization of eve"" as if it were knocking our doors already.wow itself could still be the epic game it were before all the panda and celestial **** horse steed things, the change that made it crap wasnt the things you could buy or the things you could do, but the actual no change from what it was as far as gameplay goes to what it is now.gw2 is not becoming gring wars 2 because of gem store, cosmetic itens or floral interface, it is becoming grind wars because people want to be reconized by what they did more than what they do.eve is becoming a boring game not because it is going towards the casual players, it is becoming boring because players dont know what else to do with the freedom they are being given."

9/27/2013,"tldr: there is an opportunity to increase interaction between pve and cloaked ships. there is an opportunity to increase active play vrs. afk play. covert cloaks needs a balanced. this post has been edited to better reflect the subject matter and the discussion on the following thread.subject - interaction with cloaked pilots vrs pve.issue <U+FFFD> once a pilot is able to get into a system and cloak up there is no current in game mechanic to interact with that pilot as long as he remains cloaked. there is no in game or out of game mechanic to know if the pilot is afk or at keyboardthere is no in game mechanic to know if the cloaked pilot has a cyno or not.there is no in game mechanic to properly assess the threat of force projection from the cloaked pilot.the pilot if they so choose can stay cloaked from down time to down time. scope of this thread(1) - no change that would (nerf) cloak - i like them and use them. (2) - if someone is actively cloaked camping it is a non issue - the ability to hunt them would be more challenging. (3) - if someone is long term cloaking there is no mechanic to know if afk or not. this present and unreasonable threat of force projection (4) - cloaked vessels should have a mechanic that can be use the hunt them(5) <U+FFFD> current intel mechanics (local chat) does not give a proper representation of local intel. a new system is needed.this thread is not intended to cover those who log off in a system.there is only a small window of time to catch the cloaked pilot. this is unreasonable for most pilots, even the most diligent and prepared ones cannot interact with a cloaked pilot unless said pilot wants to. this needs balance.the current mechanics allows the cloaky camper to abuse it in a way where the cost to effect if out of balancewith current mechanics there is no way one or many pilots can find and interact with the cloaked pilot.this threat of force projection encourages non active play.we should have a mechanic that allows in active pilots or those with cynos attached to be interacted with. there are many arguments about pvp vrs cloaked. that is not the in the scope of this thread. pve vrs cloaked is.if there was a reduction in threat projection.if pve ships and cloaky ships were presented a reasonable chance of success in combat without hot dropping this would increase interaction. after much in game discussion and on this thread we have the following as best solutions.1. cloak and cyno fitted together give a limit to time ship can stay cloaked or make it scannable. keep in mind we already have and are getting new ships that will be cloaky and combat capable and will by pass this one.(con) if you make cloaked ships detectable, without first requiring effort to become aware of initial presence, you really do trivialize cloaks.it might as well be a regular pvp ship, or simply on a timer.knowing the cloaked ship is not being ejected or scannable, also makes it a known quantity for not having a cyno.2. scan probe that can scan down cloaked objects.this can have a large deviation factor whereas a pilot is active he can escape before getting landed on.(con)cloaked vessels would gain a new weakness, in exchange for no benefit.3. ships fitted with cloak will be unable to fit a cyno <U+FFFD> covert cynos would be ok(con)this makes system jammers redundant, since they create much of the same effect. really messes with legitimate capital transport too.4. allow cloaked vessels the ability to passively target and cargo/ship scan(con) this might affect things a small degree outside sov null, where they are not nbsi and don't run the moment a strange name appears. in sov null, the only ships to be scanned would be the pvp ships trying to kill the intruder.(from nikk narrell) and i agree[i would suggest something that increases chances for encounters.the only realistic approach, is to give incentive for the evasive players to stand and fight.unfortunately, the 4 ideas listed above don't do this. 1 and 2 make them easier to avoid, while 3 kills cyno jammers.4 is likely to make high sec more dangerous, possibly low and npc null, while sov null would not significantly be changed.]""new""5. if a contact is in your contacts list it should have a tag in local if that pilot is afk or not, this is regardless of pilots location and would have different indicators depending on location. in space would change once warp was initiated. in station - im open on this one. in summary :we should have the ability to hunt cloaked ships. even more so if they are not active.if you do not like any of the suggestions made. please give a viable suggestion for a mechanic that allows pilots to hunt and or interact with a cloaked vessel once established in a system."
9/27/2013,"first how are they denying you anything? now please just look at the question, how are they stopping you from doing anything. second, if they are not doing anything, like touching you, rubbing on you or anything else...what exactly are you defending against?"
9/27/2013,"fair questions. if in null or low sec, ratting or mining, they are denying you (if you are smart) play time as you should not be out and about due to the possibility of getting dropped on. by either caps or blops.second. invisible spies are bad enough but you should be able to defend against known spies or recon ( cloaky camper) who is gathering intel or as i put it. denying you space by his mere presence. i hope that helps elaborate a bit."
9/27/2013,"i would argue that any truly afk player has never killed anyone, which makes that not a problem.and if he's not afk, then he is legitimately hunting you, in which case it's no problem.the only problem comes from the reactions of people who don't want to have to be able to tell the difference, or adjust for the possibilities of both. it amounts to, in my view, sticking your fingers in your ears and yelling about how you shouldn't have to be listening in the first place."
9/27/2013,"this contradicts your claim as they are afk and out of the house. you can not hot drop from taco bell. you can but that is usually after...alone in your misery, gripping porcelain. the only space he is denying is the space between your ears. straight up, it is another form pvp. get creative, slip a covert cyno on your jewboat, go to the next system, rat as you would, have friends waiting, drop cyno and trousers, :fap: :fap: watching your buddies kill your little cloaky nemesis and friends. done...next?!"
9/27/2013,"you are largely not going to get sensible answers, and this issue has been flogged to death, there is actually a thread in the ideas forum where someone has attemped to keep that as the place to rage and yell at each other over this issue.i am not interested in nerfing cloaks, and while i could acept a log out after a certain time delay its not that important to me. the key thing is that you set up to deal with being cloaky camped, and i mean do not go and rent a -1.0 system, rent multiple systems with lower true sec systems, in other words have alternatives, make sure you have plenty of belts to rat in in cheap ships, then dealing with cloaky campers is fun, but if you have gone all in with a -1.0 system and you have no options then you have to look at yourself.edit: just notied your in the kadeshi, you have other systems, and are not renting, just go to another system and do something else, fun part is ifthey follow you you have a chance of killing them. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"

9/27/2013,"trolls aside, my point has been missed. i am not saying i cannot adapt, and if you read the post you will see that yes i can move to another system. i am asking for balance. yes you do not know, is he there or is he not, i am saying you should always treat them as if they are there. that is the premis. i guess i made things too complicated once again. simply. we have a cloaky in system. he will not leave. give me a mechanic to hunt him. nothing more. my apoligies for making my arguments too complex or lengthy to fully read or understand. i value the feed back of those who have chosen to respond."
9/27/2013,"it is not complicated really at all, here is the deal, the cloaky as it is cloaked can not pew pew. we all know that. we can not discern what the intentions are of the ""cloaky"". who know may have a man crush on someone in the system.we can not tell whether or not the person is in fact behind the key board.if you want the ability to kill a claoky, that can not attack in it's cloaked state, then you have to give the cloaky the ability to attack in it's cloaked state. then when you pop said cloaky due to being afk..whelp then they were afk. if they are not afk, then you will find out in a hurry.this satisfies you need to know if they are afk or not, ability to hunt them down, and the prospect of said afk cloaker pushing your **** in when they are in deed behind the keyboard."
9/27/2013,"while i apriciate your point, if only it were that simple. no i am not that stupid. cloaky already has means avaialble to ""combat"" while cloaked. yes they must un cloak to use but. say i cyno into a system with my nyx.

( i dont know you so this is just a stiuation)you plex and alt account you train a cloak and cynoyou let it die with a cyno on several times so that if anyone looks they know you can do a cyno.you go to system that i use - does not matter what for if could be a jump bridge route. you log in cloaked at down time and stay in a safe cloaked up until the next down time. you do this every day - 30 days go by you still do this every day. you do other things and check back now and again to see if somone is stupuid or decideds to risk it. senerio one happens - bad on us just because you happend to be home and at your computer looking at that screen for that one small instant in time.or we do not use the system or move there is no way to find you or keep you from doing this- revenge you have or lols or trolling abounds. whatever it is not content for anyone but you. that is not balance game play. is all i am pointing out. simple as this. somone wants to camp a system. i should have a way to hunt that person in a feasable amount of time. like i stated in my orgional post. sorry if i offend anyone, i have a job, i have a family., i pay for my accounts. i do not have all day every day just because you do. yes i can move to another system i can do a lot of things. the one thing i can not do., is hunt you."

9/27/2013,"ok, first stop using the thing about ""i am not stupid"". i work, i have a life etc etc. we all do, it does not make you special. once you log in and make post or log into game, all that crap is left at the door and every one is under the same rules and mechanics, yeah?i have lived in null for quite a while. been through many iterations of internet space mechanics through the years and have been on the receiving end of nuets/reds in system. and have been on the giving end of it also.now i know for a fact, and for years we all had intel channels. and you were responsible to ask if system is clear or what not. hard fast rules in null...if you get a report of nuet/red in system and you jump anyway..you are to blame and accountable. no one else. by using the tools with in the game, and reporting nuets/reds, not jumping into system you have denied a km for that dude that ""might"" be there. now the use of cloakies and such is a viable play style and very effective tactic. this play style is still for some reason widely unknown and understood for the vast majority of the population. you have tools and smarts, you should have mates that you work with...use them. introducing a mechanic to help the folk that can not be bothered to use the mechanics and tactics already in game is bad....mmmk?"
9/27/2013,what?
9/27/2013,"here is what i do, if baaldor gives me leave to reply, (sarc!)if enemy using sb's to engage setup covert ops set to kill sb's webs and scrams, have them cloak up ready to intervene, job is to hold in place so they can be killed.check the people in system, check when they moved corps what time and go back and check if weekend, find any links you can to that charcter and assess the kb for who is likely to be linked to them. assess fully the system location and likely jump in spots, have people check the eve map for cyno's in systems they may used as mid point. if you are dealing with solar and i assume you are then they have supers dotted around logged off and a network of cyno toons ready to log in to get them out. from my prespective dealing with that means you have to go with a cyno gen, as that is too much of a risk.for most black ops fleets, setup two carriers, have to have same defensive type, have them fit for triage and tank and have them rat together. now they have to bring in a really big blops gang to do that, we did thios with razor and ratted with a red in system and he did not have enough to kill us, up until they brought supers into the area then we stopped, but that is where your cyno gen comes in.i like cloaks as they are, and do not feel they should be changed or any of the other things people have suggested including modules that de-cloak system wide, cloaks make playing this game possible for a lot of people and while i feel your frustration it would be a bad move game ways to nerf cloaks. the cloaks are in fact a balance at a higher level imo.edit: suggest you post in this thread"
9/27/2013,"so after reading your wall of text, i shall refer you to the first line where it says:""working as intended"".yawn, i'm right as usual. the predictability kinda gets boring really."
9/27/2013,"my only issue with the is the way the payout occurs. unless you are in a ship of sufficient value, the full payout doesn't occur and the bounty stays with you. ex. player puts 25m bounty on you. maybe for no reason. you go out of the station get podded. no big deal, podded once, you lose clone and viola, go on with your life. not no mo.now the system is merely just another way to grief while afk because you don't even have to make an agressive move on someone to earn a bounty. maybe you need that character making isk in an npc corp in empire so you can support your pvp?the current system really is just a way to get around war dex and characters in noob corps. obviously this is something pvp'rs must have cried about to get changed. boo hoo, i can't act my anger issues out on x, because they are in noob corp.bottom line, you get podded once, bounty should be paid out. you shouldn't have to lose 25m isk or more worth of crap because someone cries you cornered their market in jita. and you shouldn't have to be podded 6-12 times before you lose that bounty. did billy the kid get killed 12 times before the bounty got paid out?just stupid. all this does is force people to use more alts, which isn't a big deal when you have 3 accounts. whatever. the pvp'rs cry more in this game than the high sec carebears, ffs. i fully expect to see this get whacked with a nerfbat at some point because it's asinine. happy flying. ;)"
9/27/2013,"ignoring the obvious butthurt in this post...such a system would be invariably used for rmt and/or exploits. which, in fact, is precisely why the current system exists as it does. suppose, for example, that you really hate me, and put a 1 billion isk bounty on my head with your system. do you know what i am going to do? i am going to pod myself with my own alt, give myself the money, then send you a mail with my own killmail, thanking you for the isk. that, and player freedom is more important than hurt feelings. don't like what i have to say on the forums? put a bounty on my head. i care not."
9/27/2013,"oh, yeah, and since i'm at work i will have to add a bounty to you later. i hesitated at first when i saw you were in an npc corp, because you might have been a posting alt, but it said your employment history for that corp was ""6 years...""so now i have no problem giving you a hefty bounty once i get back home from work. the major issue i have with it, is that i can't give you a bounty straight through the forum system. that's what we all need to be talking about, a bounty button needs to be added to the forums. i'd happily even pay a tax on the bounty amount to be able to do so."
9/27/2013,"oh so in other words, you are one of the butthurt pvprs and are cool with the system because you can exploit it in your favor.you point out a potential exploit, yet you refuse to see the exploit on the opposite side of the fence? yeah, that makes sense.no sweat. the way around this is to start putting bounties on every noob in the game. before too long they'll be meaningless or the noobies will cry because they can never get ahead on isk.sounds fun, doesn't it?"
9/27/2013,"hey, no problem jack. i can give you one as well. i haven't played for 6 years, but the isk is piling up and itching to get dumped on someone. might as well be an upstanding eve citizen like yourself.i hope you can compete with the bounties a t2 bpo lets you put on someone. have a nice day."
9/27/2013,"so, you even admit that your way would be open to massive exploits, but you would still prefer it... why? i mean, what is the exploit with the current system, aside from people getting upset over having the ""wanted"" sticker on their poster? really, tell me, how is the current system exploited? it was intended to let anyone put a bounty on anyone else, for any reason, so what's the exploit? please do so. i pride myself on my nefariousness. a higher bounty is just more fear i can engender in others. make it a billion, if you have the money, that'd get me some damn good stature with my buddies."
9/27/2013,just gave you 30m isk bounty to start. if you cry enough i won't put more on you. otherwise i hope you got a lot of alts.ill let you figure out if the current system feels like an exploit.
9/27/2013,"more, please. i have like ten alts, for starters, and that doesn't even equal my highest bounty. i mean, is 30 million all that a ""t2 bpo"" can muster? i assure you, however, that you could empty your wallet and i would not ""cry"". the current system to me, feels realistic in the context that we are all functionally demigods. i mean, yeah, in real life you get the full bounty if you bring back enough of the head (which, for some history, is where the concept of the ""double tap"" came from), but then again we aren't guaranteed to be reborn a few minutes later in real life either."
9/27/2013,since you cried so much i made the bounty ten times my first offer. does that work for you? we can do more if needed. why don't you list all your alts and let the public see how much sack you really have? i'd be happy to drop that much on each of them.
9/27/2013,"for reference, ladies and gentlemen, he did actually put a 300 mil bounty on my head. all of this for merely saying i was going to put a bounty on him when i got home from work(apparently this is grievously offensive and disrespectful, by the way), and for some slight goading over evemails. this guy is a gem, folks. considering reposting this in c&p just for the righteous outrage at the inevitable results. i went ahead and put 666,666 isk on his head though. wouldn't anyone to confuse him for a wuss who can't back up what he says, after all."

9/27/2013,"many good ideas, this is a topic that has been brought up and over looked for a long time. changes to corp permissions and roleschanges to wallet accessit is an interwoven mess. to add you should be able to pay out salary to members, maybe add a role that lets you set an amount for each role and when you pay it auto figure .. well ok that may be too complicated. something better than shares, if you give everyone one share so you can give out paychecks, they get every mail involving a vote, and directors + ceo are the only ones who really need it. having a vice ceo or a chairman role would be nice as well."

9/28/2013,"go back to sleep and stay on your porch, you have not even the fundamental understanding of the argument here."
9/28/2013,"to the first, the cloaking mechanic is the one being used. it is possible to log in right after down time. hit cloak and stay cloaked until the next down time whilst doing noting. to your second questoni have made several suggestions. 3 are perceived as nerfs to cloaking. the fourth is an added mechanic to allow non cloaked or cloaked pilots the ability to interact with cloaked pilots."

9/28/2013,i like the over all premise of the op. some of the concerns voiced are legit some i'm sure is coalition for cowards trolling.now to maybe improve on the op idea. make the timer for subcaps so bridges are more for tactical positioning of subcap fleets instead of a way to blob some one. caps would not have this timer and my logic for that is if you drop a cap fleet on a sub cap fleet it will take much longer for cap pilots to target the sub caps (at this point i'm theory crafting seeing as i have yet to use a cap in a fight).now i would say cut the targeting timer for sub caps to about 30 seconds.

9/29/2013,i think the big issue is ccp's active encouragement of players using multiple accounts. i run a multi screen rig so i could sit in a grav site 100 off and just watch for a target while running missions in hs. that toon is both afk and manned at the same time. i completely endorse a high sp skill set to scan down cloaked ships that way a player who is cloaked at least needs to watch d scan which is at least is a form of playing. i really think that scan probes whose whole job is to scan down cloaky ships would be a fair comprimise.
9/29/2013,"i expect to get trolled bad for this one, but how about this, the efficiency of a cloak with a cyno onboard is affected so that it will give a top skilled scanner the ability to scan it down within 20 km using special probes. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
9/29/2013,ok so once again looking at several responses this post has received i am beginning to doubt my ability to write clearly or (most likely) those who read these forums reading comprehension rate is to be abhorred.(1) - i do not want to change or (nerf) cloaky - i like them and use them. (2) - if someone is actively cloaky camping non issue - i just want the ability to hunt them. (3) - if someone is afk cloaking (a) - gives the impression of active cloaky camper (b) - is very hard to discern from an active cloaky camper (c) - should have a mechanic that i can use the hunt them (d) - should have a mechanic that decloaks after a long period of inactivitythis is not a proposed nerf to cloakingthis would be added mechanic to allow active game play and induce conflict.currently when someone cloaky camps a system yes people leave or stay docked.that does not encourage content. having a mechanic that would allow me to hunt cloaked ships would. i did not say make it easyi did not cry about i can do nothing as yes i can leave and go somewhere else.and as far as null bearing it what part of wanting to hunt cloaked ships gives the impression of bearness?we should have the ability to hunt cloaked ships. even more so if they are not active.
9/29/2013,"you already do,catch them at gates,set trapsjint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
9/29/2013,"but i asked which game mechanic they are using to interact. the whole point of a cloak, is to stop interaction on both sides. so no it's not the cloak.your answer to my second question actually busts your first, because of that.so which mechanic is it and why are you not asking to nerf that? oh and any change that reduces the cloaks ability, is a nerf.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
9/29/2013,"sorry, i can't fix stupid and as coy and cute as some responses attempt to be, they are well still stupid. so respectfully i incline to disagree. if i enter a system and someone is there cloaked and remains so for more than an hour i should have an option to interact with said person and not just leave system.sorry if that pisses in your cheerios by denying you the ability to sit with a an alt cloaked in a system to extort isk from the locals."
9/29/2013,"dude, if you do not like the answers you are getting and obviously all our answers are stupid, you seem to be too butt hurt and resort to calling ""everyone here "" stupid, it is obvious you are playing the wrong game and you might want to gtfo. thank you, and have a nice day."
9/29/2013,"i understand your frustration and also your irritation with people coming up with the responses that they do, mag's and i have had an exchange on this subject before and all he wants to do is remove local, which seems to make sense to him and others. i replied to them that this was stupid due to game balance issues based around cyno delivered force projection, they disagree, and in fact i see their point in that if someone is watching local and gets aligned they are impossible to catch, but there are gaps which is why you see many people getting ganked. with the changes to interceptors in terms of bubbles and the warp speed acceleration i forsee more people getting caught which hopefully will reduce the number of people who do afk cloaking, if what they say is true that afk cloaky camping is due to the inability to catch someone due to local, then logically there will be a reduction, i await that possibility with interest.another thing they mention from their side of the equation people go afk sitting in stations and at pos's and i can see their point on that. but they are doing it not to intereact with someone, more to do with not bothering to log off, but it again has an interaction in that the person coming in system to engage has no idea if they are active or not. i know that myself as i have recently started camping.one time i tried to explain the data supplied by the map and on dotlan made it very easy for people to vector on to active people, especially now with dotlan doing a npc kill delta, check it out i am using it, my point being that if they remove local then remove all of that, this was ignored by all and what was amusing was one chap, who i rather like who mines did not see any issue in keeping that data as it did not affect him, however his killing of npc ships in belts would get noticed and of course the industry index.on balance i have had less impact from cloaky campers because i can play when i want, i am retired and as a result i can pick and chose when i rat, which makes me an immensely irritating target, again another reason why i don't get war decced.i do wish that the other side of this argument would be a bit less smug at times, a prime example is baalldor above, but sometimes you have to get into their head to see what their reasons are, i hope you can see that even though they can be a bit crass they do have some issues. to be blunt like they have with you, they have at times got up my nose, because they also seek to shut you up by replying in such a way to make you lose your temper, i like many have fallen for that too, but they have at times been fun to spar with, especially when they can be seen to be hyprocrites on this subject, however that still does not help you.. at the end of the day however i look at that person who is afk cloaky camping withoujt any attempt to kill anything as being lame, i have killed some, my favourite was a goon tengu which i baited in a badger mk ii, but then again he was actually killing things, noctis and industrials. and this is the key to it, you have to act in such a way that they have to do something to prove that they are there and able to impact you. there are various strategies to do that as you are aware. that being said if they have camped your system for weeks and done nothing then they are truly lame as players. and if he is one of those please email me privately with his name. perhaps a good idea will be to create a database of these types of lame afk cloaky characters so other people can share the details of their activities so that we can work out whether they are linked to someone with capabilities or not. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"

9/30/2013,"first my sincere apologies for anyone who has brought valid arguments to this discussion and actually read what this post is about. i was not referring to your responses as stupid. assumption makes an ass out of everyone.if cloaky campers were active and moving about, yes it is possible to catch them at gates or bait them.however when they are only semi active and log in before you do and then never decloak, those are a little more difficult to trap bait or catch. difficult as in impossible. those are the ones i wish to hunt. the ones that never decloak. the cost and effort between the cost of disruption and the ability to perform disruption is out of balance. one person, on one usually plexed account, can disrupt a system from use for multiple people using multiple accounts. if that person so chooses to not decloak, there is no avenue to combat it or remove the person from system.this is not just limited to ratters and miners, it can depending on the system, disrupt trade, travel and a host of other activities. no one against the idea's that have been posted on this thread, has given an existing method to deal with a cloaky camper that has established him\herself in a system and refuses to decloak. in game discussion with other pilots and some on there have the following as best solutions.1. cloak and cyno fitted together give a limit to time ship can stay cloaked or make it scannable. keep in mind we already have and are getting new ships that will be cloaky and combat capable and will by pass this one.2. scan probe that can scan down cloaked objects.this can have a large deviation factor whereas a pilot is active he can escape before getting landed on.3. cloaks can be cap hungry to where no possible fit will allow a ship to remain cloaked for more than one hour.this would be an actual nerf and very hard to implement and as such is not one of my personal picks.4. anyone in space whose ship does not perform some active function for more than one hour logs off. this can give several warnings such as we get for the approach of down time. it will affect everyone and not just cloaked pilots.actions can be as simple as moving stuff from cans to cargo bay or as in rorqual or supers moving from one bay to another.in cloaked ships it could be as simple as changing speed or turning. every other mmo i have or currently do play has a limit to inactive time spent in game. i like this one as it forces pilots to be active in the game and not afk.personally i prefer 2 and 4.if you do not like these solution please post a response with a valid workable solution to cloaked campers who do not decloak.edit to #4 - the new crest api tools will eliminate the need to have a pilot logged in to get market data, also i did not include docked pilots, only pilots in space. and for clarification only the pilot that has been inactive for an hour."
9/30/2013,"the conflict we are seeing is due to the fact you have two camps. you have the ones that play the game and work with in the mechanics and game play, and the ones that do not like the game play and mechanics<U+FFFD> and try to change them through means of technical proposals. the crowd that plays within the system already, thrives and understands the mechanics, will explain in terms of practical game play and experience. less technical more experienced. they also believe that this what they pay to play, and this is how they like to play a game with the play style and mechanics already in place.the crowd that does not thrive under the current game play and mechanics want to change it with mechanics and forgoes the acquisition of experience. more technical but less experienced. they too also pay for this game, but they have a different view on how it should be played and due to the fact they pay money to play, it should be changed to suit their game play."
9/30/2013,"i cannot speak for others, but i personally do not want local removed. how you thought that is a little puzzling, as i have said i like the status quo many times.apology accepted.the answer to the first question i posed is 'local'. the reason i asked the question, was to try and have you look at your issue from another angle. one that took into account all the mechanics being used. at the moment you're fixing the effect, without looking at the cause.now to your ideas.1. this would be a nerf to active play, which i believe is not your issue.2. scan probes would also affect active play, as you would have insight on intel gathering. this include watching stations, as well as getting into position for a warp in. also with a large deviation, catching someone cloaked and moving would be a problem.3. cloaks are already balanced in regards to fitting. but yet again this would nerf active play, which i believe you are against.4. log off mechanics are bad in 2 ways. firstly they are easy to counter without breaking the eula.secondly you failed to ask yourself whether ccp actually want this. the reason i believe they would not is simple. we all play on a single shard and the more players on-line, the better for ccp. in fact i would go as far as saying those afk, are actually great for ccp. low load numbers are not to be sniffed at.now as i have said many times, i like how things are right now. but if you wish to remove afk cloaking, then local must be a part of that change. this means a decoupling of intel from it and replacing intel gathering with another system. this would be as part of a package and that package would also include ways to either hunt cloakers, or a nerf to their abilities in other ways.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
9/30/2013,"this is an insight that i have not considered. i would find this acceptable as long as the new way of getting intel was as efficient is as local. one way to do this is by concord transponders. all ships fitted with a pod have them as that is how concord tracks, allows gate access ect. what do you think if the current d scan mechanic that scans the system gives you pilot transponders in system. this would not give ship types or location just the pilot in system. to update this information you would have to re scan. with a system like that then you could have local chat where only those who spoke showed in local chat. we could then include a scan mechanic that tracked the transponders cloaked or not allowing to scan ships down. by this method it would still be difficult by sig radius and wot not to track a moving ship. cloaked or not as it is now with un cloaked ships. however a stationary target would be found. i am just shooting from the hip here but this could answer several proposals. the vigilant should not have issue as the only change would be to tap de scan every so often to get an up date. the down side is it would take more that scouts would have to be more active. i do not have a problem with this. although i know this may be troll fodder for thinking so."

9/30/2013,"ccp has already declared they are adding twitch, a 3rd party program, to eve in the upcoming rubicon expansion. so why not add eve-radio.com? by adding a player run radio station to the game you would only be furthering the plan to put more into the hands of the players and less in the hands of the npcs. think of the implications! advertising for various corps could be done by paying of djs with good time slots and a good fan base. news/information would be more readily available. things said on the media could cause political nightmares (just like in real life). they have been supporting eve for ages, and adding them to the in game code would greatly increase their audience, which might also increase their dj count and the quality of their djs. not to mention it would also make their bills more affordable ^.^disclaimer: i do not represent eve-radio in any way shape or form. i just think it would be cool if they integrated it while they are integrating other 3rd party software/websites."
9/30/2013,"there are, of course, hundreds of points i could make about how this will never happen. but, in short1) eve radio and twitch are very different things. twitch, for example, is for-profit, whereas eve radio, if i'm not mistaken, is non-profit.2) content licensing for streaming eve online on twitch is pretty much non-existent. streaming music content via eve radio through the client would be a legal nightmare.3) the jukebox was removed. deal with it.4) twitch utilizes datacenters in multiple regions for streaming. eve radio, from what i know, does not.5) streaming to twitch is not the same as streaming music from eve radio. integrating the streaming of directx rendered eve content to twitch's services is completely different from integrating an audio stream. alongside this, twitch is likely providing some degree of support to ccp for the client integration, something eve radio would likely not be able to do as eve radio does not code nor create the applications that perform the bulk of the backend work of their service.the list goes on.so no, this is a bad proposal."
