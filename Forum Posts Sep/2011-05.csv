5/1/2011,"just making it possible to drop not just multiple outposts per system, but even multiple outposts per planet (as long as they're at least 100km apart edge from edge) would be more than enough, no need to buff the number of industrial lines available per player outpost.the material adjustment would not really be needed, since you always have hauler drops, and if that's not enough, lowend prices will eventually just go up to compensate. in fact, this will create an imbalance in mineral pricing between 0.0 and highsec (highsec with expensive highends and cheap lowends, while the reverse would be true in 0.0).having ""personal arrays"" gives a much to small entry barrier, which means just about any outpost will do fine, and you want a certain degree of concerted effort to be made for a healthy market to emerge, not just about any outpost out there.an initial investment the magnitude of an extra outpost (or several extra outposts) will make the owning alliance want to promote the area as their own regional hub, and also, make it a more attractive capture objective by competitors.obviously, the ""system capture"" mechanics would need to be altered to not include outposts (or, only include any one outpost as opposed to all of them), because otherwise you could just outpost-spam (however expensive, for some alliances it could actually be practical)."
5/1/2011,"you do realize that, in the two years+ that i've been playing, i have found more people who do highsec industry that agree that it is barely profitable, even with the refining at stations. i've also experimented with it personally, and found that, (unless you have a lot of people doing something for nothing for a corp), aquiring the minerals and building anything is time consuming and very nearly a waste of time. actually, it is a waste of time, and it amazes me that people still do it.you can put a buy order out for anykind of mineral and spreadsheet everything to cost calculation vs. potential sale value of product, and work in a profit margin between the two. first problem, is that someone actually has to fill your order, which, given the competition, is not as easy as you might think. competing for those minerals only drives the profit down lower, and you end up with a barely profitable venture that takes two to threee times longer to complete than it should have. second problem is actually getting it to market and profiting from it, as it could take months to sell, and you have to compete with sell orders to get the product sold, and still make a profit.if you factor in the time to do all this, with micro-managing, transport and manufacturing times, you come to the conclusion that it is entirely pointless, and a complete waste of time. yes, i'm factoring in high me/pe bpo's here.nerf it anymore and you won't have anything to buy. not from me anyway, though i suppose i can't account for people who apparently have their whole lives to waste, and think it's fun even when they lose isk. that, and increasing demand may actually drive the prices up which may help a bit, until everyone runs out of isk.why don't we just focus on nullsec and boosting production capabilites for pos and by other means.that may even help highsec production, though it may also drive it into the ground when all you mad-happy-pvper's stop buying ship in jita and demand drops through the floor. then we'll just have a whole lot of worthless ships in jita that cost a whole bundle of time and effort to create. along with modules and whatnot of the tech ii variety.shocking isn't it.i do believe nullsec industry should see a big boost though, along with wormholes. the first step to that is production capability. refining in a pos is stupid. manufacturing and research in a pos are awkward to manage with pg/cpu and defense concerns. a large pos is the only way to go, if you've half a mind to do it, and it costs you rediculous sums of isk/time to maintain it. how can that work out to a profit, or even be worthwhile, unless you make more use of it than that?i remember once spending two weeks mining on a nearly daily basis, for hours at a time, just to build a maelstrom. that was with the help of some corp mates, using a couple hulks, a retriever or two and an orca with fleet bonuses. two weeks. maybe that's realistic in the grand scheme of things or maybe it's not, either way, i'll never do it again. in a game, no matter which, that is a complete waste of time; as i believe was agreed to by everyone in corp after. this is why people use macros, because it reduces personal effort, and makes the venture somewhat more easily rationalized, possibly much more easily rationalized.i'll never, for this reason, believe anyone who goes on about how they went on this 'awesome' mining op with their corp, and how they mined continuously for hours, and repeated this process everyday. it was so fun, and they talked about all sorts of things, from posts in the assembly hall, to what their dogs ate for lunch. it was great.yeah right. maybe once for a few hours, or even a few times here and there, but not when you look at the result, and not after days or months."

5/1/2011,supportedmost of all.. armor rep bonus must be changed
5/1/2011,"nice to see everybody and their alt supported this.fleet op's? i'm thinking no, maybe not. don't really like the idea.isn't draketrain a corp that flies all drakes in a massive blob formation? totally off topic, but i had to get that in there.csm was nice enough to put up a thread regarding ship fixes and improvements. mostly, they'd like to know what everybody thinks sucks about ships in eve, so they can tell the dev's and hopefully encourage a rebalance across the board. you should check it out.black op's have been kicked to death already, in a number of threads, and everybody has a different idea how to fix them. mostly, that results from some notion that they've come up with a cool tactic that would only work if you had a ship with all the features requested. great, wonderful idea.now let's move on. ccp is not going to be able to apply a 'fix' that suits everybody, and is even less capable of doing so following the advice given here.why?because nobody agree's on anything here. everyone wants there own thing, whether it be power hungry solo war machines or fleets required for even the simplest operation no matter what ship you're flying. neither is a good idea.solo is good, fleets are good, and leadership skills are slightly overpowered in any case, but only when up against the solo guy, who is most certainly dead anyway.whatever happened to being able to run away? you just can't do that anymore.live to fight another day? nope, not here, this is eve."
5/1/2011,why not make it so that the pilot flying the black ops doesn't show up on local until he speaks in the channel. have black ops deal a perfect wrecking hit the first time it decloaks and attacks on an unsuspecting enemy.
5/1/2011,"i am not sure when exactly this changed, but recently drone damage is now listed in the overview notifications just the same as everything else. this certainly can be useful, i am sure carrier and other drone-focused pilots must appreciate it, but it should certainly be separable from turret damage and other notifications. the turret notifications are very important, as they give the indication as to how well you are hitting the other guy. if the other guy is moving too quickly and i am barely hitting them, it would help if i knew that in a somewhat timely manner. now though, if you have drones out and they are also attacking, they drown out the more important turret notifications, and you are flying in the dark. i personally would rather know if my turrets are doing what they should, not what my 5 light drones are up to.this can very easily be fixed by making the drone notifications a separate option in the menu. gunners can then focus on what they want and drone boats can still have the option of keeping track of their little minions.any comments are welcome."
5/1/2011,"ok ladies and gents, here is my 2 isk worthi'll make this easy to understand as possiblei'll take a day out of my playing life,i don't bot, scam or have heaps of skill points i do have a pvp/pve character in 0.0before the anomily nerflog in, choose character, check mail, see if any ops are on that my limited skills comply with, attend/don't attend that op, if no op, go pvp, pve/rat, or mine.convo and talk to my like minded corp members and alliesgenerally have a good time, if i make enough isk over a week or so maybe able to buy a ship to pvp in or replace a lost pvp ship, have fun is my main aim and do as the game says risk = reward tis why i'm in 0.0 right?after the anomily nerflog in, choose character, check mail, she it 5 more corp members moved back to empire space because the nerf killed their income to the point where they could not stay???see if any ops are on that my limited skills comply with,oh thats right there is no one else to come along now that they have moved back to empire, so there are no ops, not that i could attend because i lost my pvp ships and can't afford to replace them, limited skills = not much income anyway, well lets do some pi, check local damn you mean the 4 afk/active campers are still here 5 days later, (the nerf allowed them to concentrate, where as before they were spread out)not that it mattered the corp has taken down all it's pos's so no fuel is needed, (another income down the spout eh)so i rat then, i jump 5 jumps through a wasteland that used to be full of other allied members to the next system worth ratting in again, bow bow it's camped by 5 afk/active cloakers, what do i do today, no one to talk to or convo bar the enemy and i don't speak their language (stumped there),what are my options 1.get a bot to fund my pvp (idk about you but i won't do it), 2.move back to high sec like the others is becoming an option to fund my pvp, so less pvp fights more missions, not really excited about that, bah so i log off and go play another game becauseeve is loosing it's fun factor for me, i love to pvp but if i can't fund the ships.my opinion is to un-nerf the anomilies thus allowing less skilled players like myself to stay in 0.0, now i'm not knocking the afk/active cloakers i'd do it to now if i had the ships, but in 0.0 you have to start somewhere and what the nerf has done is make it so much harder for the small corp/guys like myself to make the ends meet, how can they get their own piece of 0.0 if they can't fund their pvp losses, it's that simple."
5/1/2011,"oh i can think of a few considerably worse ... problem with setting the bar too low to cater to low-sp individuals such as yourself is that it benefits botting and heavy alt use while acting as molasses on conflict in general .. grass has to be greener somewhere for the sheep to dare venture the great unknown.""do not fly what you cannot afford to lose"". ring a bell?all the nerf did was force people to run the numbers again and either downgrade ships or skip an op or two while gathering.fly afs, interceptors and other 'cheap' stuff until your skills/income can support bigger. if your corp/alliance has a craptastic reimbursement system that doesn't help you help them, then why the hell stay in the first place?."

5/1/2011,"apparently, not very many people today remember that ccp created a game where griefers like themselves could play together in the sandbox. this proposal actually undermines some of the very principles that run through eve's blood.having weekend suicide/griefer alts is a time-honored tradition for many an industrialist as a way to blow off steam.you might also consider that there are five empires that compose concord, and i really don't see the jovians giving the other four any say over their internal financial affairs, even if the state were to permit the federation or the empire would give the republic any oversight of the private transactions of their citizens.in practical mechanics (as many have commented on), in lore and in theory this proposal fails the sniff test."
5/1/2011,make it so people stop self destructing for sole purpose of robbing us of our kill mails. a simple solution would be to make it so that self destruction results in not getting an insurance payout.
5/1/2011,"sure, i'm good with that. bloody cowards should fight to the death anyway.okay that was fun, thanks."
5/1/2011,"fine, but then also make sd almost instantanious. if you shoot someone usually the goal is to destroy his ship, his ship is destroyed, what exactly is the issue?"
5/1/2011,"ah, the natural and inalienable right to kms."
5/1/2011,they're also robbing you of any modules or cargo that happen to be on board their ship
5/1/2011,"this will allow you to ***** a few extra km's... but it'll have so many unintended side effects. the irony is, it won't even fix the problem."
5/1/2011,clearly the real solution is to remove killmails from the game
5/1/2011,"actually, not paying insurance to ships that selfdestruct sounds normal to me. there's not one insurance company that would pay /me/ if i'd wreck my car by intentionally hitting a tree."
5/1/2011,not paying insurance to ships that self destruct is fine as long as it is put in-game at the same time as not getting insurance for suicide ganks where concord pops you. the two go hand-in-hand.

5/1/2011,"can we please get t3 frigs. everyone wants new stuff, everyone asks for things like submarine warfare, or dreadnought killing battleships. instead of asking for one mega overpowered ship, can we just have a line of ships that we can customize?"
5/1/2011,"i think that was the idea of t3's, though unfortunately we all got aboard the failboat for that one.why? what happened?turns out only one configuration of each t3 is worth half a damn, and the rest are crap. go figure."
5/1/2011,"lol on that one, there are many different setups for each t3 ship. just for tengu i have 3 working just fine for their purpose, an they only cover buffer tanking for fleet fight, there are quite a few setups for active tanking. can't say much about other t3 as i dont fly them.as for the idea itself of t3 frigs, i think that t3 destroyers would be more interesting. they could have setups for pure dps, some for scouting (covert maybe, but we have that in both, frigs and t3), and maybe even some for interdicting (maybe bubbles that can hold even interdiction nullified t3.anyway - more t3 stuff would be interesting."
5/1/2011,"no. if they scaled in comparison like t3 cruisers, then they'll be grossly op as you'll have something that hits hard, hard to hit and probably come to the cost of a t2 fit tier 3 bs. so it will essentially become the only ship to ever pvp anymore. if anything, i think they should have t3 rigs or modules that work something like implant sets. that will give the ship overall boost in stats and boost them by percent with matching ones. that or t3 bs, an expensive bs that specializes in killing super carriers. obviously not one t3 bs could take out a sc, but have certain focused stats that would work great in large fleets. but then again, probably would be better off getting fleet of scs to counter the scs."
5/1/2011,"not necessarily, depends what the sub-systems do. if its a copy/paste of the cruisers then yes but there are other options that might actually augment the frigate class rather than obsoleting it:jumpers delight: cyno frigate with 2x recon bonus and ability to jump itself.fcs crutch: ewar immune long lock range frigate with small sig.fcs wheelchair: deploy pos like shield bubble on battlefield, depletion of which means death of frigate.etc.tank/spank is more than covered by afs and pirate frigs so a t3 should tap some of the unused potential."
5/1/2011,"at least two thirds of the existing frigate range is terrible worthless junk, they all need fixing before any more additions are made to the frigate range (let alone massively customisable additions using the t3 template that inevitably result in hilariously overpowered death machines)."
5/1/2011,"so mining, pirating(or pvp), salvaging and industry are good sources of steady income, if you just want to grind away at it. what is missing is for haulers to have the same kind of steady stream.yes, there are courier contracts now, and that has made it a lot better than before, but the problem is that anything worth contracting is valuable and with it comes collateral that are just too expensive for beginner players to afford. or the cargo space too large for beginner ships.what that results in is that there is no real 'pure' way for a beginner hauler to make money. they are forced to do either some trading or some mining on the side, in order to generate the goods to haul, splitting their skill points.proposed solution: interbus contracts -- ferrying of passengers.both npcs and pcs can be ferried from a->b. npc ferrymen who fly interbus ferries operate anywhere in empire space. (with fees charged to customers depending on #jumps). players can 'book' an ticket with interbus and catch a ride on the next ferry which operate once a day/downtime, anywhere in empire. npcs will fly interbus ships with no weapons.players can also be ferrymen, with the right module upgrades to their ships (to make it passenger ready) take npc or player contracts. their ships can be from a list of ships that can be retrofitted to be a ferry. (no freighters allowed)npc contracts will pay depending on #jumps and passenger load via formula, so long as passengers are delivered ontime. (can take the form of interbus agent missions in stations)players can create their contracts (private booking) and post in contracts page. passengers are anonymous, but the rewards are defined by how much the player wants to pay. these contracts can be from anywhere to anywhere.attacking ferries:attacking a ferry load in emp space will cause severe standing hit. concord will protect immediately, even in low-sec emp space. (there are non-capsuleer civilians on these afterall!). rememeber interbus operates only in empire. exception to this is if the ferry load was a private contract. (players ferrying contracts that are not interbus contracts are not registered with concord, so they don't have the same immediate protection). these haulers need to find their own escorts. normal concord protection rules apply in emp space, with the response time depending on system sec status.if ship destroyed, then passengers are killed via same percent as loot, some may remain alive in the can. if pilot is forced to eject (abandoning the passengers) then pirates can claim all passengers alive. big standing hit with interbus if pilot abandons ship without dying themselves.captured passengers can be ransomed. interbus will pay standard ransom amounts for npc passengers. perhaps have a ""level"" of passengers akin to the ranks of dogtags to make vip passengers demand more ransom. maybe use markets mechanism for allowing pirates to 'sell back' passengers at certain stations (just like npc station buy orders)captured capsuleers (this is the fun part), can be ransomed directly with the player. once a person places himself in a contract, a new game mechanic would prevent them from leaving the station that they registered themselves as a 'passenger' in. they can still do market, do anything that you can in the station, but just not leave the station (if they do, they cancel the courier contract that they placed themselves into).while in transit, the player will need to be restricted as well, as if in station (but not at any particular station, for purposes of market access) a new 'in transit' locale will need to be used, with incarnia, maybe some 'transit screen' player can check mail, and access neocom, but that's it.if captured, then pirates will negotiate release through neocom. pirates can choose to return passengers or kill them. killing them is the same as podding. returned players return to station of departure."
5/1/2011,"...continuedso why would you want to be a passenger? (either interbus or player contract depending on destination)well, anonymity. as a passenger, your name will not show up in the grid. you are just one of the trillions of citizens in new eden going to and fro.getting yourself to low/0.0 easily, when you are not a pvp character who can afford to fly a battleship to get to your destination. maybe you are just a rich industrialist.so that takes care of the demand for the service as a passenger.why would you want to be a ferryman?easy decent steady income stream for beginner haulers in interbus contracts.harder but lucrative income streams for advanced haulers in private contracts.and income stream for pirates too.additional miscellanialocator works in locating somebody who is 'in transit'. the name of the pilot ferrying and the system is reported (for pirates tracking down specific people to kidnap). passenger's standing matter for interbus contracts - no outlaws (-5) allowed to take contracts or be a passenger on interbus (npc) contracts. as a ferryman, the contracts that are available to you to take depend on both your interbus standings and your concord sec status. (we wouldn't want a shady character ferrying some planetary governor)i think that this new market will open up the hauler profession and have it stand as its own, instead of being just the necessary evil of a trader or a miner profession. it fills the hole left missing by the parcel courier contracts which were inaccessible to new haulers due to costs and it also opens up a new revenue stream for pirates, and kidnappers.oh, and it also makes the situation of john rourke in 'clear skies' a reality. win."
5/1/2011,i quite like the idea of ferrying players around. there's quite a lot here and i think it'd be better to focus on just one thing :) so supported in that instance. also you should support your own proposal lol
5/1/2011,"no and yes.no:no, concord should act as usual, and not in low sec spaceno, players itself should not be able to use this thing for transportyes:yes for only one thing i see as usage (other than npc missiomning which i dont care for) - that is transporting of players jump clone from point a to point b.and that should not be linked to special modules or special ships, or limited so that freighters can use it. it should work like normal courier contracts.so, no support for this proposal, but i can see something can be worked out from it."
5/1/2011,"thanks for the feedback!it's very much a proposal in-the-works, and actually looking forward to any arguements that may illustrate any potential flaws.thanks bumble and max!wondering though why you think that we shouldn't transport players themselves max? besides the only reason i can think of, which is more dev work for ccp. i do like your idea of jump clone transport, which will achieve essentially the same thing, although ferrying would have to check the standings of the toon at the destination so that people can't use it to work around the standings requirement for jump clone installation.negative of this is that it restricts people from going to places where they have not sufficient standing. if we only did the jump clone moving option that is.i really envisioned this as a way to get from a->b, for players who neither care to spend the time to jump themselves, nor the capability to do so safely (in the case of going into null sec), and are willing to pay instead, and take the risk of kidnapping. i can believe there are a lot of station traders or alt toons that could use this service, just to be moved without the tedium of doing it themselves. and in the case of npc ferries, which move once a day (and perhaps will not even manifest in real game mechanics as a ship, just insta-teleport you) they provide the service for anyone who ever logged off and thought, wouldn't it be nice if i could just wake up tomorrow at point b?for the jump-clone add-on (to which i give the credit to max for thinking of it) i think that freighters or any ship will be able to courier them. the ship upgrades/restrictions was more for live passengers (npc or otherwise) the reason i thought to add this is because that as npc contracts should be primarily a source of isk for new haulers, i didn't want freighter captains to come in and buy out all the passenger loads leaving none for the little guys. i suppose an alternative is to make the npc contracts payout low yield, so that freighter pilots won't be interested. also, the thought of booking passage in the gaping maw of a cold dank freighter cargo bay seems a little off. so let me refine it a bit more,a) npc ferries run by interbus 'move' you or your clone during server downtime, and cannot be intercepted. works only in empire. no outlaws allowed to book passage. (like major airlines). works as an insta-teleport, booked through station services in neocom.b) private/public commissioned loads are carried whenever the player wishes it. reward paid on delivery of you or your clone at or before the designated time. can be hijacked by pirates for direct ransom. (like chartering a flight, and taking a charter - aka han solo in tatooine). works like a courier contract.c) some passenger loads are issued by interbus. these have no players or clones in it, just passengers(mortals). these provide low end cash flow for new haulers. no outlaws allowed to take contracts. can be hijacked. passengers can be 'sold' back to interbus for pirate cashflow. (so this makes low end money for both new haulers and new pirates). works like a mission from interbus agent.d) concord acts as normal in all cases. (agree with max). my original thinking was because i wanted more risk for the pirates involved if the npc 'bus drivers' were present in the game. if we do not represent the npc ferrymen at all, and instead make it an insta-move during down time, then no need to change concord mechanics.how does that sound?"
5/1/2011,"interesting, but it needs tweaking.interbus operates under very strict rules regarding neutrality and secrecy. any new game mechanic to be introduced should, ideally, be consistent with the lore.sources:"
5/1/2011,"proposal is kind of interesting (though tbh, i've seen it before).but there is one flaw in your logic. anyone sane will need to insure his ""journey"" with the same high collateral, or he will be dropped in the most inconvenient location, make no mistake."
5/1/2011,"but surely - unless i'm issing something, of course! - if the passengers are transported by npcs (i.e. interbus) during dt, they will be plopped down at the station of their choosing?"
5/1/2011,"plexing isnt appealing anyways!its wrist slitting boredom.these changes turn plexing into a life or death commitment to a fight, in order to secure vp towards making a system vulnerable.anybody not wanting a fight will find nothing of value in plexing any more.goodbye wcs frigs.hello combat fit ships designed to sit on a button and hold it whilst taking fire from enemy players.aka: hello fun :)great!use an alt to activate a plex timer, alt is locked in plex waiting for enemy wing to show up.enemy faction arrives with 5 combat ships to defend said plex, using up their activation limit at the gate. alt in plex is only allowed 4 combat ship reinforcements into same plex before entry gate closes, meaning that the morons that used an alt are actually at a disadvantage as they only have:(4 players + alt) vs (5 players)how is this a good idea?what benefit is there to using an alt?answer: none."
5/1/2011,"yeah, um...no. not true."
5/1/2011,"well, okay, i've never tried it personally, but i know a 2003 player that seems to think it works. maybe it used to and doesn't anymore, i don't know."
5/1/2011,"i think,before any overview enhancements are made, the entire overview settings window and layout need a revamp, its really hard to get to grips with, when i first started playing i struggled to get it to not show friendlies, not show people with certian standings as red all the time and collumns/tabs, rows. it needs an 'esc' menu for itself, as in eve the overview is them main interaction item/window you play with.having choices for:- colour of certian projected effects (such as mentioned here; locking, agression, helping)(so you can then manually set different things to your chosen colour)- shape of certian projected effects icons(an array of different shapes and sizes, for each class ship and such)but the way it is now, the settings window is just a little too fiddly to add more into it.but supported non the less!!!(and red, agression colour of choice, should always override the friendly colour, as this could lead to many n00b ganking exploits...... just saying :p)"
5/1/2011,"account sharing is banned in the eula i believe - thats more than enough reason to ban an account.on a side note, hearing that ccp's looking into 23.5/7 usage accounts and banning them makes me a little happier about the bot war!"

5/1/2011,"using a macro violates the terms of use. sharing your account info so multiple people can use 1 account also violates the terms of use. so you committed a bannable offense either way. also, this be the wrong place. petition ccp, petitioning the csm and other players won't get you anywhere."
5/1/2011,"i find this thread to be pointless. you want to petition your **** back, but you then state you are deleting the clients. that seems a bit unhealthy to rotate playing time with accounts. go outside and spend time with your kids. take them to an amusement park or a museum or something. hell, you live in australia, do what all aussies do and go ride a kangaroo and throw boomerangs at wild dingos and cook snakes!"
5/1/2011,supporting this for great justice.also watch out for cyber-stingrays!
5/1/2011,"i, too, use my dying relatives to justify why its ok for me to cheat.edit:also lolling at the racism. 'guys you shouldn't ban me, i'm not one of those horrible yellow skinned isk farming commie *****s, i'm australian!'"
5/1/2011,"to be perfectly fair, did you ever check what kind of animals live in australia, it was supposed to be a prison for a reason, just about everything is there to kill you, i dont even trust the koalas anymore. i would rather have my kids playing eve 23.5/7 then go outside in australia."
5/1/2011,"i like this. it's way too short of a trip to invade other regions. i moved my carrier, pretty much half way across the galaxy in 3 or 4 jumps. as for the stagnating thing, that's not true. from experience, when lazy alliances like se and coven don't like to move far, they will reset other people nearby. think it was about 2 years or something, when goons left quarious/delve, stoven(se+coven) got bored and then fired on it. this then caused conflict with sys-k and stoven reset sys-k too and then was pretty much forced into period basis. so from this, we can see something like this will have a likely chance of causing smaller coalitions. does it guarantee it? no. but its more likely to happen then fighting over true sec systems... because people want to pvp, and not have to take all day to get there. not rat all day."
5/1/2011,"looks like it is more you dont get it, everything that promotes conflict results in larger coalitions.related to that, this is a sandbox, the issue isnt large coalitions existing, the issue is that you need large coalitions to have sov. in a non-sucky sov system if one alliance is twice as strong as the other one, they can hold on to twice as much space. but since in dominion defending your first system isnt noticable easier than defending your 100th system the alliance that is twice as strong will take all space."
5/1/2011,"so you admit this change wouldn't do much because there would be so much yellow that people would disregard it and that it's easy enough to spot legit orders?then what's the point? other than suggesting devs waste their time on something that adds no value to the game.new players will figure out scams like everyone else does: fall for it once, spot it or even maybe bothering to read the forums."
5/1/2011,the server also doesn't like thousands of people jumping into one system but we still do that regularly ;)
5/1/2011,i like this. it is annoying to bounce back and forth.

5/1/2011,you dont know what your talking about do you!?how can you kill something thats cloaked! duh! thats the issuepeople can just camp systems with afk cloakies and stop the whole system. thats the issue. fully supported that there is some way to find them whilst cloaked.
5/1/2011,"theres an easier way than having to scan people down, make new modules etc.just make the cloak use cap - that way, the cloaker would either have to gimp his setup to make it cap stable, meaning that the solo cloaker would actually have to pick his targets instead of just being able to pound anything that isn't a domi, or not be able to cloak-afk for 23/7 without the cloak eating its way through his cap, and turning off - then making him scannable through normal means. simples."
5/1/2011,i just received word that white tree is leaving test to join goons. quite rightly the test players feel they have had their votes stolen by their so called friends in goons so that they have full control over the direction of the csm and ultimately the game we all play.considering he is leaving the alliance that backed him he should step down and if he will not be removed so an alternate can take his place. how can we let a group of known scammers and griefers destroy the game?
5/1/2011,we control your game now:smug:
5/1/2011,"calm down, he isn't leaving test. even if he did leave, why would he step down?"

5/2/2011,this is mainly for gallente ships but some also cover gameplay as a whole. also i'll not include all my explanations for each of these but i'll link the original thread so you can read my justifications there.original thread:
5/2/2011,"okay, i've thought about it, and i'm ready to reply.first off, i'd like to say that eve needs a first person mode of starship control and command. this should be an optional perspective, and be available with incarna as a choice made when first entering the game, available from the new starting area in command quarters. this doesn't mean it has to be available when incarna is released, just that it can be a feature added later.here's how it works:the camera's which float around your ship, are the key. obviously, moving the perspective to a full first person mode is not a viable choice, as we are still pod pilots. the first person perspective of command will center all the camera's facing out from your ship, slightly above center and clear of the models structure. you still rely on them to show you the world around your ship. from this pov, the player will see his ship beneath him, and be able to rotate his view to look around and up. a hotkey to invert your view, may be used to have the same perspective, from the bottom of the vessel. this will bring players closer to their ship, and make it the center of their universe.zoom options will become available in this perspective, allowing players to look at more distant objects with the scrolling of a mouse wheel.reintroduce the radar. currently, the blob of ships and objects around your vessel serves as a radar of sorts, allowing you to see everything around you, from a zoomed out perspective. this will not function with a first person perspective, and players will become more reliant on their overview, and rediscover the need for an actual radar.the radar will be 2 dimensional, and relate all positions as out from the ship, whether they are above, below, or next to it, based on distance and relative position. dot's on the radar will indicate, (through shape), ship or object class, and position. those above will be one color, below another, and next to a neutral balance; between those, will be a shade between. for example, we could use blue, yellow, and grey respectively.introduce collision damage, and alter collision avoidance systems. damage from collisions, (with any object), will result in damage affecting shields, armor, and structure on a vessel, bleeding through from one to the other, with the majority of damage hitting the outermost, (generally shields), first. damage will be dependent on mass and relative velocity, and will be affected by the inertia of both. collisions will no longer result in rubber ball effects.to avoid collision damage on warp in's to gates, asteroid fields, stations and the like, we will introduce a 10 second delay for ships to rephase with the physical universe on completing warp. ships will continue to travel in a straight line, or will automatically redirect their trajectory, (with normal inertia effects potentially halved and without reducing velocity), towards the nearest edge of any model they happen to be within upon leaving warp.effectively, warp is extended, until they are no longer within a physical structure. being out of phase, ships in warp will now have a cloaking effect, from the point where they enter warp, until that point at which they leave it free of obstructions.i do not play eve to have the impression i am playing ping-pong. the effect is undesireable and unrealistic.i would also like to see a captains cabin arrive with incarna, or sometime after as an addition. like the captains quarters aboard station, it will feature the ability to move around and have a viewport to see outside your ship. other players may visit you there, when they are onboard their own ships, and within a reasonable proximity. this will be projection, and not in fact actual forms and physical interaction. the quarter's will be entirely virtual, and exist only in the pod pilots minds, and be accessible through their interface with their ships. i believe something similar was done in a chronicle once."
5/2/2011,"specifically regarding ships, i have the following to say.weapons aboard ships should see some change. i'm not talking about the new animation effects, graphics or similar things. weapon placements aboard ships need to see changes in other area's.take a battleship for instance. typically it carries 5-8 turrets, which are mirrored somewhere else on the ship, only one of which ever fires at any given time. basically, this is fine, but ship classes only really fit one kind of turret, or a smaller version in equal numbers. this should change.imagine a battleship in eve with only two large turrets, yet also sporting four additional mediums, and another six small ones. while it may put out a significant amount of dps with such a configuration, it can only do so within the range limitations of it's smallest turrets.more to the point, such a ship would more closely represent a space faring version of a real battleship. frigates would no longer be able to single handedly take on a battleship, nor would most cruisers. battleships would have a purpose, and be much more capable of defending themselves. a reason for the class would exist, and combat of all sorts in eve would evolve.evolve.this same can apply to battlecruisers and cruisers, dreadnoughts, carriers and supercarriers. currently only range is a factor in choosing to go for a bigger ship class, which is quite often silly when missiles are brought into the equation. and then, there are drones which can be had in greater number aboard some larger vessels. this is irrelevent, when you consider an ishtar in the equation, as it holds and fields more drones than pretty much any battleship.frigates need a little love to. they generally lack powergrid, while having ample cpu, and limited fitting hampers them, or just plain makes them all but useless. there are a few exceptions, which serve well in some situations, yet these are exceptions and not the norm. most frigates are fragile and easily destroyed, while being incapable of fielding any real offensive force.cruisers aren't much better. most of them are useless, and not just for pvp.ships need to scale properly. a big ship should be big, and no drone should be more than half the size of a frigate. large ships may even need an inertia dampening effect, which slows other ships down around them, though not much and relevent to mass. kind of like coming close to a planet.larger ships need higher maximum velocity. despite their mass, there is no reason why they should not be able to achieve higher speeds; it just might take longer for them to do so. smaller vessels like cruisers should have higher maximum velocities as well, as should nearly any other vessel.to counter the effect of increasin velocities and time required to reach maximum velocity to warp on larger vessels, velocity required to warp should be relevent to the size of the ship. all vessels should take approximately the same time to reach warp when traveling within a straight line, allowing for slightly increasing times to achieve warp, (in a straight line), for even larger vessels. this is space, there is no reason we should need to move so slow, beyond that required for tactical maneuvers in engagements.blobs will no longer exist.with collision damage and increased velocities, players will have to take greater control of their vessels, and more care will be required in fleet formations.this will also affect pve macro's like ratting bots, making them less reliable and potentially unusable."
5/2/2011,"eafs. in general they are simply too fragile. all of them should have their sig radius dropped, maybe even in half. they have poor survivability in small gang situations because their ehp is so incredibly low.in addition:sentinel: a few hundred armor points would go a long, long way here. fitting is also very tight, even with perfect skills. could use another low slot and some extra grid/cpu to stick something in there. i also wouldn't be adverse to an extra 5%/level range on the neuts/nos. if not this, then at least make the small faction neuts cheaper in the lp stores. the cost of those things is insidiously high.kitsune: i'm actually fairly comfortable with this ship (and yes, i do fly it). you're forced to choose between mid-range, high strength jamming or boosting its effective range. what i never understood is why it lost the base hull's drone bay. i want my guard dog back.keres: what's the point of a damp ship with such pitiful targeting range? give it 60km or so. an extra 2.5% damp strength would help a lot too.hyena: the web range bonus is useless if you can't get into range. that means you need a mwd. the mwd blows your sig radius up to the size of a small moon. the 3% bonus doesn't cut it. the paper thin ehp just got worse. if you're worried about it taking over the role of an interceptor too much, then perhaps reduce the base speed so that it goes about 2.5km/s with a mwd. needs more cpu, too. it isn't possible to get a decent fit using all t2.i'm generally happy with the build cost of these ships. i wouldn't want them to be much cheaper, but not more expensive either. unless they don't get buffed... then they need to be cheaper."
5/2/2011,"print this out and have it sent to every employee at ccp. sov. nullsec is literally choking to death on these ships. the experience of the sc pilots themselves is not fun. i've been flying a nyx for over a year now and i'm not enjoying myself. as for the rest of the troops who are out there in hellcats, hacs, carriers, and anything else that's not an sc... well, i can only imagine they are miserable. they exist entirely to bait other sc onto the battlefield so that the other sc pilots and i can kill them. that is the sum total of all goals in 0.0 right now: build more scs, kill more of the enemy scs.this needs to end and the sooner it does, the better. i'm more than willing to see my nyx nerfed or out-right removed from the game if that helps bring back meaningful sub-cap interaction in sov fleet warfare."
5/2/2011,"and, to parrot:the tier system is terrible. too many ships are simply useless. buff the terrible ships to be in line with the rest so that they're worth flying.the amarr t1 cruiser lineup is pretty sad. the arbitrator is nice, but the rest are sad. bonuses to laser cap usage aren't a good enough reason to fit lasers to a ship; people end up using acs instead. change those bonuses to a rof or damage bonus or range bonus or something worthwhile. heat bonus?ham prophecy would be super cool. please, please, please give me a reason to fly that ship. the ship model is awesome.angel ship line is overpowered, the dramiel in particular.succubus, phantasm, cruor need love.the sacrilege is a nice concept, but it is lacking as a hac. it needs to get very close to its target to really do anything, unlike other hacs which are agile, fast, and can do good damage at range. a cool buff to the sac would be a much larger cargo bay so that it can store more cap boosters for the dual-rep fit. speaking of that dual-rep fit... it would be nice if other fits were viable for this thing.i want active tanking to be viable in general, not just for a few niche ships.gypsio's take on a wide ship nerf isn't a bad one. i would rather buff than nerf, but if all ships end up well balanced then i really don't care.unprobeable, off-grid boosting is terrible and needs fixed."
5/2/2011,this!
5/2/2011,"i find it funny that on the official wiki (evelopedia) pages 2 out of 3 suggested fits for ishtar does not use hybrids even though this ship obviously has bonuses for hybrids. its nice you provide actual advice for new players, but come on! fix hybrids!!!!!!!"

5/2/2011,"this suggestion lacks focus. op starts at industrialization of nulsec and goes on to talk about pvp? focus more then i'll support.i have never seen a shortage of mfg slots anywhere in nulsec, unless it was npc space. those slots cannot be lost due to invasion of enemy forces (barring a permanent station camp), and thus are more desirable.confirming that refining at a pos is stupid bad. stations insta-refine and do it far more efficiently. unfortunately, only certain outposts get refineries, and only 1 is currently allow per system. i feel this is one of the biggest road-blocks to nul-sec industry.it is far more efficient and time/cost effective to export moon-goo and import low-ends in the form of cheap meta 0 items.the limit to stations in system is absurd, encourages alliance sprawl, and thus increasies said alliance's sovereignty upkeep costs.if ccp's current desire is to get alliances to concentrate more in those desirable systems (better true-sec), then allow alliances to plant more than 1 station/outpost per system.furthermore, allow planted stations to be removed/recovered/destroyed. the wayu things are now, nul-sec will eventually have a station in every system. boy, that'll look good on the map, eh? then what will there be to fight over?"

5/2/2011,"following on from this, it would be nice if research towers could use blueprints in your personal hangar. unless you trust everyone in your corp who has roles, researching high value bpos in a tower isn't really an option. this is because anyone can cancel it and take the bpo from the corp hangar."
5/2/2011,"why i have to move around stuff inside the pos?we have for example one pos in our wh with 8 equipment assembly arrays. in addition one component assembly array. when i log into eve the first time of the day i'm first have to locate in which of the equipment aa all the materials and bpcs are located, move them around, start jobs and move them around one more. if somethin is missing i have to take an industrial anf fly things from hangars or the component aa and store them in the equipment aa.thats a pain in the ass, its only costs time and produce server load. its a big space station, it should be able to handle such things by itself.so what i would do:arrays and labs have no more storage space, you just can install jobs. your minerals, bpcs, bpos, moonmaterial etc. is located in a corporate hangar array. from here you can select the bpc, bpo and install jobs into labs, arrays whatever you have anchored. after installing the mats the job are required disappear and after the job is done the endproduct appears in you hangar array. it would be nice if this would go hand nd hand with the change that you can open containers inside the corporate hangar array to sort your things."
5/2/2011,"the permissions/roles system in general is terribly broken and borderline unusable, but particularly so when it comes to pos management.as a ceo, i should be able to create an arbitrary number of roles. those roles should be able to provide very granular permissions on a per-pos basis. it is mind-boggling that anyone thought it was a good idea that any permission applies to all towers.pos structures are too communal. there's no personal storage.i'm okay with the fuel being the way it is. you know how much you need, you buy it or pi it, you transport it, you're done. changing to fuel pellets won't really change anything. it might even make things worse; instead of one player making fuels a and b, and another making c and d, now they need to get together an add yet another step in the process to make the pellets. suddenly fuel is even more expensive - as if the never-ending rise in robotics et al. isn't bad enough. no thank you.want fuel to be more convenient? set up the tower to automatically draw fuel from the corp hangar array as needed, then use the fuel inside of the tower itself when the hangar array is empty. you can dump 6 months of fuel in there one time then not worry about it.some pos defenses are laughable. blasters are near useless. a stealth bomber can tank torp batteries. there's no reason to use a tower other than minmatar unless you desperately need the cpu for labs or the extra silo space. speaking of... why are gallente towers so under-tanked compared to the others? i'm fine with manual anchoring and onlining systems. being able to queue anchoring and onlining means that someone can enter a system and drop a dozen essentially self-assembling towers with minimal effort. this makes space invasion too easy. the timers also ensure that he structure is vulnerable until someone puts in the time to make it defensible. you want a tower? then put in the time necessary to set it up.and, what's the deal with containers? being able to rent pos facilities to the public would be very cool. not just research slots, but production, storage, etc."
5/2/2011,that is what needs to be fixed. this proposal would fix it.
5/2/2011,"your proposal doesn't solve the problem. we have guys running around low sec all day long looking for mission runners and plexers. we know where they are. we, and they, know how to counter npcs.the plexers (and mission runners), the ones who want a fight, give us a fight. great fun!the other plexers (and mission runners), the ones interested in system occupancy (or making isk), run away and don't give a fight. boring!you are then either forced to orbit a button for 20 minutes (or hang out for 12 hours) to grief, err, keep them from acheiving their objectives. solution: ignore the occupancy weenies who don't want to actually fight and instead go have some fun finding plexers that do.i am beginning to believe that having a resolution to the conflict not based on absolute time is the key to more fun. offensive plexing: kill all the npcs and you're done. offensive mission running: complete mission you're done. defensive plexing: ??, defensive mission running: some poison pill like cutting the net that effectively fails their mission if they don't fight you. figure out a good mechanic for defensive plexing that doesn't involve orbiting a button for 20 minutes when the offensive plexer bails, and you figure out the occupancy solution. perhaps give the defender the right to close the plex but not gain any points towards occupancy after he pushes the offensive plexer out (???)."
5/2/2011,"i'm not sure who the ""we"" is in your quote. but your entire militia does not know where every plexer is. i cant emphasize enough how this will change fw plexing.i have sat in plexes for over an hour. (i dont even start the timer because i dont want the npc agro on me or the enemy) mostly im in ships ranging from t1 frigates to t1 cruisers. i find it very hard to believe that *no one* in the entire opposing militia wanted a pvp fight with those sorts of ships. and yes i have spent some time on the gallente front sitting in a merlin in minor and medium plexes waiting for fights. if you knew i was there, why didnt you come fight? seriously get a t1 hull and go sit in plexes. i think you will find you only get about 1 decent fight per hour! i had been doing that for months, but an hour is too long to wait for a single 60 second fight. so i am letting my accounts run out and will resub when ccp develops something where i can get about 4-8 decent small scale fights an hour. lets face it you didnt know i was there- even if you were logged on. even some of the people in local likely didnt know where in local i was. like you say currently you go chasing someone around. which we both agree is bad gameplay. but if we were alerted where the plexes were being taken then we would not need to chase people. the best way to do plexes would be to split up your gang throughout the relevant low sec regions. that way the person running would have nowhere to go since there would be someone else a few jumps over chasing him out of a plex. in the meantime you would be doing plexes yourself waiting for others to come to fight you or going over a jump or two to fight or chase the enemy. you would be on teamspeak/vent deciding if you wanted to gang up on a larger target or how to best use each and every pilot throughout the fw regions, instead of just telling the blob to hold on gate and call primaries. thats right, the best way to win the occupancy war would be to break up that blob. pretty much everyone in eve who wants allot of, easy to find, quality, small gang pvp would join fw in order to do plex fighting. that is allot of people! i and many others would actually start playing the game again. the inside of a plex would not be a good place to go to avoid pvp. these regions would fill up with lots of players stockpiling t1 insurable ships to go pvp in right close to the action.suddenly capturing 111 plexes would actually be an accomplishment! winning the occupancy war would actually be an accomplishment right up there will winning the alliance tournament. suddenly being good at fw plexing is seen as meritorious and doing the plexes would be fun 23/7."
5/2/2011,"people will (have) ignore(d) the broadcasts after the ""nth"" time they run out to maintenault only to get blueballed by a plexing alt. your ""reward"" for pushing them out is to sit on button for 20 minutes. problem not solved.note: if somebody wants fights in a plex, they open them in oms, heyd, tama, or some other system that had lots of wts and pirates in it. lots of good fights.edit: buy yeah maybe it would work as a good ""dating service"" if the names of the pilots involved were broadcast as well."
5/2/2011,yes a dating service might be a good analogy. more like speed dating but you do more than talk. and yes the pilot names should be broadcast as well. but i will tell you hide and seek plexing would no longer be viable. people will go into plexes with the expectation of getting fights and those expectations will be met. there are too many players in eve crying out for small gang pvp for this to be anything other than a huge hit. this would change eve from a game that only people with way too much time on their hands can play to a game that people would be logging in and getting good fights in a matter of 3-5 minutes! it would be a constant rush. i will admit i didnt spend much time at the gallente front but when i did i went to the places you mention. no fights just allot of sitting around inside plexes. i did the same in kourmonen and ammamake and auga and kamela and dal. lots of sitting around wasting time very little fighting. that is what the current eve is all about. but it could offer allot more.
5/2/2011,could we get this stickied?
5/2/2011,"+1six months is plenty of time, they just need to prioritize based on how much time they have. can't cram an elephant into a thumbnail. small iterations over time will lead to less bugs each iteration, show constant improvements, and allow for smaller gra"
5/2/2011,"so true. we also have major alliances flat out telling new players ""don't train gallente."""
5/2/2011,upvote.
5/2/2011,an emphatic yes!
5/2/2011,"i have the exact same issue.color blindness issues come up regularly. why not let us customize the interface's colors as we see fit? also, more blackness in space (as opposed to bright nebulae) would help a lot. a light yellow module activation timer is completely invisible to me in certain solar systems.i could not disagree more. players who pay attention to the combat situation, take the time to learn about various ships and their capabilities, or put in the time to build their own tools for profit calculations, should be provided with an edge over those who want everything done for them.modal dialog windows are terrible and should be removed. it would be sweet to select an overview setting for my scanner from a dropdown instead of the ""use overview settings"" checkbox. my scanner can use one setting, my overview another.this is a fantastic idea. even better to break it up into multiple contests that can be run concurrently. one for in-space flight, one for market/production/science windows. i try not to bash eve's ui -too- much, because we need a lot of important data all at once to be visible. it's hard to make something that communicates that much information and not have a cluttered screen. if that information is taken away (for example, velocity, angular velocity, radial velocity) then eve loses the depth that it is known for."
5/2/2011,"how about adding a ""reprocess"" button to the sell item screen so if you decide the prices aren't to your liking you can quickly reprocess said item? right now you have to exit out of the sell item window, then right click the item again and reprocess...that's just unnecessary extra clicking."
5/2/2011,yes
5/2/2011,"back to the top for a good idea, due it's place in the sun."
5/2/2011,"if you make the ships with the shortest range the fastest, how is that going to make kiting worse? that would practically eliminate it. also, increasing sd strength without increasing range will make it no more or less op than ecm is now (probably less tbh). and notice i said you can't separate the rig changes from the gallente speed buff because killing the rig penalties without buffing gallente speed means we just have a different flavor of kiting, and a new buff to amarr/minmatar."
5/2/2011,"i do like that you get the notifications of the damage drones do.but i would agree that they do ""spam"" the notifications and i would enjoy if there was an options to show ""drone notifications."""
5/2/2011,open the combat log and see all the data? but it wouldn't be a bad idea to be able to filter based on certain types of either incoming or outgoing damage. probably a very low item on the low-hanging fruit scale though.
5/2/2011,"really just need to stack drones and have a single damage event rather than one damage event for each drone. they did that for guns, it would make sense to do that for drones as well.edit: supporting a change."
5/2/2011,"let's see, the fact that there r only 3 slots per account and new chars can't magically summon free isk (wouldn't that be nice for newbies?) and even if they did, they would make great suicide gank fodder in their t1 industrial. oh and every account u open will cost u $20, essentially spending roughly 400-500 mil isk every time."
5/2/2011,"let's see. trial accounts to get around the 3 slots, the new character doesn't need any isk since their only purpose is to accept a contract and make another, t1 industrials never enter the picture, as the existing highsec hauler alt is still doing what they do (with one extra step added), and trial accounts to get around that last part."
5/2/2011,why not put a 5 minute counter on a self distruct of a ship or a pod.most battles are long over before that.if you really need to pop yourself cause you got yourself stuck in a wormhole - a 5 minute wait isnt that bad.on that note - if you are on your 5 minute counter - and you disconnect from the server ( intentionally or unintentionally ) - you should not warp off - but stay put in the same spot till u blow up. still leaving somone the option of doing you the favour.
5/2/2011,remove insurance from the game completely.
5/2/2011,"arguably, theres not one insurance company that would insure your demolition derby car either, even if you werent intentionally ramming other people with it... terrible real life comparison"
5/2/2011,"dev blogtry the eve fiction section of the forums, though- there are some decent fanfic stories there."
5/2/2011,"thanks seamus, i didn't know there was lore associated with interbus. in that case we should make a new set of npc corps for this purpose, caldari spacelanes and the spacing guild, for instance.bumblefck is right, for moving a->b with no hassle in empspace, npc delivery shouldn't be a problem.di mulle, good point, we would need collateral for private contracts that players would take, but the only reason you would use these is for travelling to low or null sec, and these contracts will be expensive anyway and only meant for experienced haulers/smugglers, so it doesn't hurt the low end empsec market.for a deterrent in empsec and low end contracts that beginning haulers may take, we should put a secstatus penalty for dropping the passengers off at a different location (its definitely criminal, as it amounts to accessory to kidnapping). so what would prevent pirates from starting an alt and pick up some contracts and flying them into harms way? (meaning into an ambush with pirates who kidnap the passengers in space, thereby avoiding the aforementioned penalty) this one i may need some advice on, but i thought maybe some sort of tally, of passenger loads lost to pirates. if you lose too many then you lose your 'license' to carry passengers. this license would be one of the things that you would need to buy in order to start carrying passengers, along with the aforementioned modules/rigs to your ship. this is to make a barrier to entry that would make creating new hauler alts for pirate mains for the purposes of 'feeding' their main toons, non-economical.additionally, if the problem is still that every budding pirate would create a hauler alt to feed him prey, and even though we have made it restrictive to 'build up' a new hauler alt too often, the problem is still how can we prevent it to feed pirates a steady stream of npc passenger heads to sell. (assuming the hauler only takes npc interbus** contracts)then, what we can do is the system will penalize pirates directly for attacking and ransoming npcs, by way of putting bounties on them. these amounts will depend on the vip value of the passenger load (which depends on the standing of the ferryman who took the contract, which also determines the reward for delivery). this makes sense, as kidnapping civilians is a serious crime and their are families of these npcs who will put out bounties on any perpetrators. this should limit these types of piracy to only the very notorious pirate.**'interbus' still used here just because it's convenient as a name."
5/2/2011,"i like this idea, adds new depths and ways to assassinate people."
5/2/2011,"so the updated proposal:a) npc ferries run by interbus 'move' you or your clone during server downtime, and cannot be intercepted. works only in empire space. no outlaws allowed to book passage. (like major airlines). works as an insta-teleport, booked through station services in neocom. if interbus used, then use the existing lore, (ie they move only 13 jumps from interbus headquarters) else come up with other npc corps for providing this service, like omnibus, or others.b) player created private/public commissioned loads are carried whenever the player taking the charge wishes it. reward paid on delivery of you or your clone at or before the designated time. can be hijacked by pirates for direct ransom. (like chartering a flight, and taking a charter - aka han solo in tatooine). works like a courier contract. standing loss and sec penalty for dropping off cargo at a destination other than the one specified. contracts can be collateralized. having your ship blown up by pirates and losing your passengers (npc or pc passengers) will incur no sec penalty, but will incur standing loss with carrier, restricting your choice of future npc contracts, and the number of times you have lost your load will be displayed on your record (as a percentage of total successful deliveries). players can restrict their contracts to pilots who have certain success ratios only.c) npc passenger loads are issued by interbus(or other npc corps). these have no players or clones in it, just passengers(mortals/civilians). these provide low end cash flow for new haulers. no outlaws allowed to take contracts. can be hijacked. passengers can be 'sold' back to interbus(or corp) for pirate cashflow. (so this makes low end money for both new haulers and new pirates). works like a mission from interbus agent, passengers use the in-game items that you can move into cargo holds.d) concord acts as normal in all cases. (agree with max). my original thinking was because i wanted more risk for the pirates involved if the npc 'bus drivers' were present in the game. if we do not represent the npc ferrymen at all, and instead make it an insta-move during down time, then no need to change concord mechanics.e) everytime a pirate shoots at a passenger carrying ship (one that is fitted/rigged for carrying passengers, and who's pilot is a licensed operator, not just any ship that happens to be holding the passenger items in hold) they will get a warning. if they ignore and fire, concord will respond as per normal rules. if the ship is destroyed, then a bounty will be added to the pirates name by the system. this is in addition to any sec penalty and bounty added for aggro'ing innocents. this represents the bounties put on the pirates head by the families of the (npc) killed/kidnapped. the bounties are more (x5? x10?) if any citizens were spaced (killed) when the ship popped. this makes the 'ideal' heist for a pirate is to force the hauler to abandon the ship intact (having the hauler take the reputation hit) in order to minimize bounty placed on them.f) locator agent will be able to find players who are ""en route"" if they are in a passenger manifest of a player ferry. they will not be able to find them if a player is a passenger on an interbus (dt) ferry."
5/2/2011,"a positive side effect of this new dynamic in the game is that more people may want to take up the hauler career. presently, as their are no ways of making money as a beginner hauler, you end up being a trader/hauler or a miner/hauler, but the hauling part is a secondary profession. i envision a universe where their are expert haulers who know how to evade pirates, and know the best alternate routes around space. also large convoys of haulers moving as a fleet together, the same way convoys in wwii did for protection in numbers.if there were more haulers, then it would help other related professions, like trading and mining. imagine if there were a lot more haulers, then it would be feasible to contract out to haulers to move your low cost goods around within emp space. presently, as there are no low level haulers, the only ones who take courier contracts would scoff at a 20k reward to move tritanium from jita to rens. but its exactly that kind of cheap hauls which would make the life of a miner and a trader much easier.basically, the economy needs more haulers. good for the economy, good for lazy players who can't be bothered to fly themselves around, good for pirates as extra income."
5/2/2011,so few players would encourage orchestrated situations with expendable alts locking the plex out.
5/2/2011,"yes, pirates and militias can camp entry gates, exactly the same way as they do already.if we fixed it so they were not able to do this, then we might as well be playing sto.can i just check to make sure your ship comes equipped with a d-scanner??if so, can i suggest that you always scan a plex before warping to the gate?in this case, if u find more than five ships on scan, u can assume that just maybe it could possibly be a tarp :pnext objection please."
5/2/2011,"""describe in single words, only the good things that come into your mind about your alt""seriously, maybe im a bit thick , does someone want to run a thought experiement here and actually explain to me how they are going to use their alts to *break* this mechanic?it feels to me that folks are failing to read, heads too full from reading other threads.you send a n alt into a plex and camp the gate? is that the sum total of your objections or am i missing something, because if thats the problem then it only applies to people without d-scanners.i.e. n00bs"
5/2/2011,"you are the one with impaired vision as you insist on believing that having 2/3rd of what makes/breaks a pvp engagement applied automatically and setting hard limits on engagement size, will be good for gameplay.you may have been in the war since the beginning, but it is evident that you have very limited experience with the whole plexing system .. guessing your exposure to it has been chasing frigs around which is a pity.let me reiterate my previous as you apparently didn't understand it: was your suggestions to be implemented, speed frigs would be in all plexes and run to next plex at first sign of trouble ad nauseum .. there would be no fights at all since no one likes having most of their options taken away (ecm/neut to break tackle, no active tanks, no movement away from timer etc.).to get the maximum oomph with number limits necessitates faction ships, automatically excluding the pvp newcomers who have the most to the gain from fw .. information of open plexes will be ignored in short order due to spam, travel :effort: and above mentioned running frigs .. it would truly become an alt war with whatever side has the most winning.i was being nice before, but no more: the idea stinks.ps: veshta yoshida is the name you want to look up if checking my credentials."
5/2/2011,"im not replacing the existing losec mechanics, im simply suggesting that there is an additional element when engaging in plexes.one still has to navigate through losec and all its goblinry to actually get to a plex.believe it or not, i stopped chasing frigs a few months after fw was released, now we use plexes simply as cover from blobs. however, most of our chosen engagements still happen at gates, not in plexes. how can they run when they are pointed by the button?they cant get off grid coz they are neuted and webbed if farther than 100km from the button.once in plex and running the timer, and only then, the plex location is broadcast, indicating that a pilot/gang is committed to the plex until the timer is complete.this is just speculation.i could just as easily suggest that there will be fewer blobs and more roaming small gangs.and in a situation where one has to hold a ship on the button whilst taking fire, i can see quite a few gang setups that use both local tank and rr. this implies that means that neuts and ecm will be invaluable.faction ships should not be considered to be t1.not a problem with plexing but with ship clasification. your alt wcs frig concern is addressed above. with all due respect (we know of your family well, we need not check your credentials), i dont think you get it.think it through in your head:alt arrives in system, alt scans plex,alt enters plex,alt is pointed by tower/button,alt moves to button to start timer,plex is broadcast as actively running,then one of two thingsa) a fight happens and the victors close the plex and take vp.b) no one gets to the plex in time to challenge the plexers, the plex closes, the button turns off, the plexers earn vp and warp off."
5/2/2011,"why? what do you think will change? you get a horde of ****-fit frigates all over the place, they are alts remember and you even want npcs removed to make it a slam-dunk.if you have a 100km neut/web barrier, then this is what happens:- alt frig enters plex and starts timer.- hostiles appear on short range, alt logs off.- alt disappears from space in 60s as normal, logs in whenever to land on plex gate ('operator' probably has multiple alts that can be cycled).- hostiles are now trapped inside the plex until timer expires and can do diddly except use same log-off mechanic to free themselves.that is what it will be like. you can change logoff mechanics to avoid it but then you are really trapping the pvp'ers, the alt could care less because he is a 40k ship with minimal skills/no implants (ie. disposable alt, aka. plexing alt).speculation, not so much. i dedicated my life to understanding human behaviour and i am rarely wrong when it comes to predicting it."
5/2/2011,"and if the alt is pointed by the button upon logoff? (does that count as aggressed??)will that not keep alt in place long enough for those short range ships to enter plex and destroy it?(having never tried logoffski, i have no idea how it works, forgive if im wrong here)edit: from evelopediaspecial caseslogging in npc combatif a player logs out from space while in npc combat, their ship will be removed from space after 2 minutes instead of the standard 1 minute. this is to make it harder to use ""logging out in combat"" as a means to escape from your enemy. note that if you are warpscrambled, you will not warp away from the fight"
5/2/2011,updated op.
5/2/2011,"the only thing i can really think of to stop macros.damage.animate asteroid fields, making each asteroid tumble and float on grid never staying stationary. change collision avoidance mechanics, and make it possible to receive damage as a result of collisions. damage will bleed through shields to armor and structure. roughly 50%, 30%, and 20% respectively.these same effects would apply to ice fields, and fragmented ice and possibly new ore types would increase the number of smaller, faster moving hazards. this will also transfer over to ship collisions, but will be the result of relevent mass, inertia, and velocity. i.e: a frigate hitting a cruiser will receive more damage than the cruiser. ramming tactics will become possible, and perhap's even give a reason to fit reinforced bulkheads and armor plates with afterburners. for the sake of this thread, the focus will remain on mining however.gas clouds will become hazardous, and cause damage to ships within a certain proximity, not affecting shields, but instead attacking first armor and bleeding through to structure, this time with 85% and 15% respectively. gas clouds will also drift and flow within a rough area, making them hazardous to be within mining proximity to.some effects of gas clouds may actually reduce ship velocity, or result in flashburns from ignition resulting from contact with ship ion trails, effectively damaging the ship, (in normal fashion), and reducing the quantity of harvestable gas available.these effects do not generate isk, and so cannot be exploited like increasing pirate activity can.with the resolution of mining macros, we can make mining more profitable, and increase the availability of various ores in all locations.additional thoughts would be the addition of ore combustibility in mining operations, such as with mercoxit, only affecting many more types of ore with a rarer occurence, even veldspar.i'm not a miner myself, but i know it to be an unprofitable venture. when compared to missioning, or any other venture in eve, mining is just not worth the time investment. increasing the profitability will only benefit macro users and make their activities more worthwhile. unless we prevent the occurence of that behaviour, mining will continue to be an unprofitable, barely entertainable enterprise.we have 6 localized trade hub's in eve, and a smattering of smaller ones that barely suceed in holding ground. between these, we see all the wealth of new eden displayed on the market orders, every ship and module crafted see's it's way to these markets, and countless other potential markets are left untouched. this is partly because there is not enough manufactured to reach all these markets, coupled with limited demand, and difficulty in actually producing all that is required to create a market in these locations. macros are running industry, and no one else can compete, with not the time, the willingness, or the ability to manufacture and produce products and still be competative in industry.if profitability is increased, macro users will increase profits and inflate prices.if macros are removed as effective means of harvesting resources, demand will increase and prices will soar, as markets deplete of all available products with their disappearance.if both are done, we'll see balance.addition of encrypting client server communications:bots rely on information sent to the client from the server, to do what they do best, so i have thought of this, (maybe not new), idea.all server to client communications should now be encypted, requiring a decryption key, (like a wep key), to unencrypt the data client side. this will be a primarily cpu load activity on the client pc, and will have little or no effect on actual gameplay. decryption keys will be random and transmitted after every downtime on client login, and possibly infrequently during actual gameplay."
5/2/2011,wait... wait... what? absolutely nothing you just said will do jack to stop mining macros.//edit:so let's see what you want done. you want every trade hub instantly closed because any griefer corp could rr a freighter on the undock and cause everyone undocking to blow up? then you want to insure that all of new eden's miner's are floating in space with both armor and structure damage.scary troll is scary!

5/2/2011,"there have been many and varied suggestions on how to make pve missions and mining for that matter, more interesting... ccp / csm should be spoiled for choice.ex. the mission requires you use your pod to enter the first gate. once in the pocket (which is perma scramd) you can select a ship from a special support ship... depending on which ship you select, the next gate will send you to an appropriate rendezvous to complete your mission. a dc in the mission ship in the mission area (like pos force fields) means you stay there and lose the faction fitted frig, or whatever you've chosen.just a single example of many many ideas given by the players of eve which, given a little time with a coder, could be added to the game.the main problem i see with missioning, is that almost every mission is written up in the survival guides, making missioning as easy as abc. i try to do missions in pvp omni tank fits now, just because it adds a little jeopardy to the mix. if ccp had a more dynamic way of building and naming missions, making the survival guides redundant, that would go half way to making missions less simple.as for mining... well thats always been a dull game... maybe npc mining rats should be around to leach those rocks out from under your lasers, so taking out an npc mining rat can reap you more ore than if you'd mined it yourself...ccp could go a long way to making the game more interesting... it seems to me though, that the ceo's of ccp are of the mindset that eve is their game and if they want something done, they will dictate that it happens (learning skills), and stuff anyone else, 'noone else rides on my roller coaster' sort of attitude... i can imagine the ceo getting on one day and doing his usual thing and getting shot down... nerf that ship that shot me down, that'll sort those @%!@#$$!'s out.sigh... maybe we will see something more dynamic and interesting when dust 514 comes out..."
5/2/2011,"learning skills were removed.please give us +7 implants.and i want more slots for drugs, and more slot 3 drugs.anyone else agree?"
5/2/2011,"erm, why?"
5/2/2011,"because they took away our learning skills... and the slots, because theres no decent slot 3 booster."
5/2/2011,they took away the learning skills and gave you the same stats you'd have if you had them all at five. what does that have to do with +7 implants?
5/2/2011,"+1, this has to be possible, they make it possible in stations (can combine ship and mod holds into a single hold if you like (avoid if you repackage things a lot))"
5/3/2011,"lets look a the original roll for the dreadnought... there were introduced back in 2005 under the cold war expansion as soon as the first outpost was advertised, the major military equipment manufacturers weren't long to respond with the ultimate tool for them. more correctly, the ultimate tool against them. ""say hello to my little friend"" now has a whole new meaning. dreads were never meant to be anti capital ships they are supposed to be anti stationary objects... which they fit rather well... sc are supposed to be anti capital with the fb... the reason i would like to see a tech ii dread is that there currently is no counter to the sc for price and ability... titans are too expensive and dreads already have a roll so having tech ii dreads being a ewar(capital nuet) upgraded dread gives a good balance to sc's... the trick is not to make juggernauts op so so each ship will have lowered sensor strength to that of their races bs's..."
5/3/2011,"this. this. and.. yeah, this.the last thing this game needs is a new cap ship class."
5/3/2011,oh... yeah... i've almost forgot...nerf supercarriers!thanks for your attention.
5/3/2011,"either give dreads a five min siege mode with extra high slots for this ""capital"" nuet or give us tech ii dreads. i kinda like the idea of a yellowish moros"
5/3/2011,how would you nerf them?reduce thier ehp?remove fb? reduce fr damage? again?make them go in a siege like mode that allows them to launch fb but makes it so they cant be rr?what is the balance you are looking for dread to sc?how does do you nerf sc without making them pve onlyships?
5/3/2011,"here's a threadtl;dr, you don't alter (much) the balance between supercarriers and dreads since supercarriers are supposed to be anti-capital, but you make supercarrier pilots have to decide on their role at the fitting screen rather than a single omni-fit for every occasion, and increase the supercarrier's vulnerability to subcapitals (particularly dictors/hictors) so that they need a proper support fleet to bail them out if they get into trouble."
5/3/2011,"yes. for example, that idea is good.however, any change that would limit their usability will be good. currently scs are used for:- killing capitals- killing sub-capitals- shooting poses- attacking systems- attacking stations- hotdrops- pve (well, before they removed sanctums anyway)in one word, they've become the ultimate ""i win"" button in the game. no matter what situation you use them in, they are simply the best tool for the job. plus, they don't have anything that can fight them except more scs, and that is only if you don't pack enough of them in the system to lag it out, so the opposing force can not even get in the system. that's wrong."
5/3/2011,"i think you missed the point of the thread. the csm is asking for player feedback, not giving you an idea to examine."
5/3/2011,more eve specials on steam. specials = exposure
5/3/2011,"people have been dragging their tongues over swtor peeks since they started developing it. it's been awhile, and they did the same with aoc nd a handful of other mmo's pre-release. personally, all i see resulting from that is fanaticism that quickly turns into bitter disappointment and eventually those players despise the developers, even before release. the funny thing is, they knew they would have to wait as long as 5 years, from the first press release that development had begun. moral: anyone who wastes that much of their life teasing themselves with sneakpeaks of future content, is bound to be disappointed. it's a given.so that is generally to be avoided on the development side, unless it is strongly considered that player expectations will be exceeded in both the short and long run. strangely, swtor has had it's share of fanbase drop after complaining bitterly about the wait, yet the remaining community is strong and remains commited despite all this. even stranger and almost unknown in pre- and post-release mmo's, swtor has a fanbase comprised of mostly rational and content individuals. i was pleasantly surprised by that.aoc at this stage had a pantheon of ex- and current beta players frothing at the mouthes and calling the dev's all manner of things. they also did a fair job of belittling and derided every positive thinking or optimistic individual who still liked the game. by the time they had finished with their efforts to roll aoc off the edge of a cliff, (one with a long drop to a wet, rocky grave), aoc had all of 1000 active members and fans remaining. i'm not sure how it's doing now.something else to be avoided. a content playerbase goes a long way. keeping current players happy and maintaining flawless, (or near flawless), content, with little or no bugs and glitches will ensure that they won't drive off potential new players. i don't see why people feel the need to do this, and i generally consider it counterproductive, as an increasing playerbase only ensures that the money will be available to deliver on those promises made by the dev's. throwing a wrench into that, only results in lost profits, and fiscal responsibilities that mean less actual quality releases on time.i should think that was obvious.that being said, players can and will wait for the delivery of that content. provided it arrives in a fashion that is neither early nor late, and it is reeased relatively free of bugs, (certainly without game-shattering ones), they will generally be happy. any bugs should of course be irtoned out within months of release, as this shows the dev's wish to expedite the process of quickly cleaning up those deficiencies.i think players harass the dev's and try to destroy games, because they think it will force the dev's to do something about it. that's kind of like beating your kids, because you think they'll be better for it. rediculous.stupid.let's move on.clicky eve advertisements on the web are not really working. they do not follow you either, it's just that ccp has paid to have them out there in a big way. i don't have tracking cookies on my pc; i kill them with fire. i still get these ad's. it's google.whatever.eve is an awesome idea, and it's a great game, yet how many players are looking for a wasd alternative to click-click when they start to play?people like first person, they can relate to it. eve controls more resemble an rts with a single ship you can control, surrounded by a few, scores, or hundreds, even thousands of other ones. people start asking how many ships they can control at the same time. you tell them one, unless they get two accounts, and then they have to dual box. this is whatr i here in rookie chat, and generally how i respond. i've made a lot of accounts and closed more than a few. to date, i think i have accumulated 9-10 accounts, of which only two now are subscribed, and two others are still active for a bit. hmmm.."
5/3/2011,"eve online banner ads remind me of half a dozen other cheap browser game ads, and that's sort of what you expect when you look at them. i've played eve for over two years and i still expect this. that has to change.make sure they know that it is an mmo, not just a browser game, but a fully featured game with content that is fully installable on your pc.sure, lots of people like browser games, even i do, but they drift between them and generally stick with one or two. eventually they may get bored, and look for something else, but most will play them for years. this is not good. it means the vast majority of players have their game, and they're not about to move on.o game for instance, looks a lot like eve in the ads, yet it is a 2d game with no real content. sorta pen and paper-ish. never played it, but i've met a few fanatics.eve has to look different.it has to stand out.it has to be recognized.there are a lot of space games out there, particularly browser based ones.eve needs a movie, or more than a book or graphic novel. i never heard of it, until just before i started playing, and i can't recall exactly how i figured out it was a real game. browser games lack account security. they also have somewhat different dev's that do odd things, and have questionable marketing and unknown motives. they are not legitimate businesses, and you have no idea who is running them.a lot of people shy away from that. they fear for their personal security, and rightly so. the administrators, and others, on the other side of that equation know where you live, within a certain radius, and gather your personal information. personally, i don't trust them myself, though i have taken my chances in some limited fashion. it's especially a concern, when yuou are aware that they know how to code and manipulate code, and are capable of doing any number of things which will compromise your personal security.a legitimate company gets credibility, and it is best to be recognized as such.trust.retail releases and advertising. companies like ea games and others are well recognized and no longer need a retail presence, or much in the way of advertising, and what they do need they have on the internet, or through console releases. a lot of games stores no longer carry retail versions of pc games, yet, when you walk in, you may see a release on console, and ask if it's available on pc. word of mouth.bittervet's.. *cough* i'm a bit of one myself. there are many things in eve that have disappointed me, most of them however, are related to the community and not the game.the other bittervet's are what they are for different reasons in many cases, though i'm sure some were driven off by slander, trolling, flaming and all the rest this wonderful community does to itself.greatest mmo community is not an opinion i share, though i will say it is perhaps the largest as it exists within a single shard universe.we are together, always. this means we have much in the way of competition, and there is only so much of any one thing to go around.at what point does the community outgrow the game?it already has.fortunately we have wormholes, which allow some players to experience their own success, where there was no room for it before. this is rapidly becoming like any other part of eve however.how many systems in nullsec, are not claimed by an alliance?a handful or more at most, and they are not particularly interesting or even available, unless you happen to be interested in joining a coalition. without being able to hold space in nullsec, one of the most profitable ventures in eve depending where you reside, (the other is wormholes), how can any alliance fund or gather a fleet to contest nullsec dominance by other alliances?unless they have friends willing to give them space and support their growth, they cannot.what is the most profitable venture in highsec?missions."
5/3/2011,"passive income.players who play browser games and enjoy rts, generally like these games because progression isn't limited to time played. income is continuously generated with limited effort, such as with planetary interaction. eve involves markets and player driven economies, ships are destroyed and lost, and pirating and griefing are the most common of activities for many players. these losses cost isk, and players are forced to continuously grind missions, mine, and pve to generate the income to replace these losses. the alternative is plex, which cost money and increases gameplay related costs, which sometimes does not fit in the budget.parents. not everyone who plays eve is 30 something like myself. how many parents like to spend money on a game, or watch their kids spend money on a game, monthly, and potentially for years to come. possibly for multiple accounts. not many i think. plenty of people are living beyond there means already, and many just don't have the ability to cover these game associated expenses for the sake of entertainment.eve allows players to cover this cost, with isk earned in game, through buying plex in a player driven economy. earning this isk takes time, a passive income is counterproductive when considered alongside development costs and a monthly fee based game. how to resolve this?given that it's a player driven economy, the introduction of more passive income will up the cost of plex's and many other things, so that may iron itself out. regardless, someone has to pay for them initially, so passive income will also result in less plex being bought from ccp and introduced into the player driven economy.plex cost more than the monthly fee, though only by a few dollars, and that decreases somewhat with the number purchased. plex is cool. it offers something most mmo's do not: the ability to turn real money into in game currency and wealth. it's also used for charitable donations by players to aid in relief efforts for disaster victims from time-to-time, as organized by ccp.this is cool. i'm disappointed to say i've never participated in any of these efforts, as they always seem to happen when i'm short on real life money and in-game currency. not sure how that happens, that the occurences coincide with my being broke, but that's just the way it has worked out so far.despite all that, passive income and plex, and profit and development, may not work out to be a practical thing at this time. that is for the dev's to decide.i think eve, and ccp, for the most part is doing well. every indication is that that is true, but representation and appearances can be deceiving and i do not know if that is the case.passive income will encourage new and old players alike.highsec is the starting point for all players. it is also the least profitable place to remain in the game, unless you happen to be some guru of financing, or run you own personal isk generating website, or both. regardless of that, there can only be so many guru's, and those following won't be so successful.eve is economy.as an economy based game, eve relies on player driven markets and competition in those markets is fierce. supply and demand is the key, and often the market is oversupplied in many areas, yet these areas are localized and centered around three primary regions. all these markets rely on local activities, which draw players to locations of interest, as well as accessibility from surrounding regions and nullsec. jita is the primary of these locations, with its market extending to the far reaches of the forge. dodixie is a trade hub reliant on mission activities, and rens thrives on pirates and missions alike, as well as access to the great wildlands and beyond. amarr exists on it's own, with close proximity to jita detracting from its potential worth as a trade hub.nowhere else in new eden serves as well in these capacities and many systems and regions are empty."
5/3/2011,"this is getting rather lengthy isn't it. i'll try to make the last part brief.highsec needs to see an increase in passive income, to encourage players to join, or stay beyond their 14 day trials, who might otherwise never play or leave within the first few days.griefers and others like them tend to ruin the game for many, save themselves, and discourage new players from joining or staying. eve is accepting of griefers and even encourages them, yet hom many parents, wives, or just generally people, enjoy their spouses or children being subject to name calling, profanity, and similar activities, or even taking part in these activities.it prolificates.i was in an e-uni fleet once for a short time on a roam, and was subject to a cursing, swearing fc which anyone walking past my door could here if they half listened. imagine someones mom listening to that, and tell me how long they would be playing the game after.that's not the worst of it. i see racial slurs, sexual connotative derogatory references, and multiple other things in chat in most any system in eve. people read this. it is not complimentary or flattering, sometimes it's quite plainly disgusting or flatly offensive.eve does not have moderators for local, and it's not possible to do so. this will discourage many from playing, or allowing others to play the game.while i do not personally get too offended, or even get offended at all depndent on content and direction, it does happen. sometimes i fear that my landlords may be disturbed upon listening. amazingly, that has not happened, or at least they have said nothing about it.all my voice chat comes through speakers, and i do not wear headphones. they make my ears itch, or sweat, and are generally uncomfortable. any more than 20 minutes of listening to anything on headphones damages your ears anyway, no matter than volume or quality of the sound.think of two teenagers sitting at a pc, while one of them plays eve. the second is subject to all the first experiences in many ways, and may not share the same casual disregard for the content.reputation.i'm trying to break down all the possible barriers to effective marketing here, and finding there are a lot of them. we've established that flaming and trolling turns people off. i think that's a big one. this is not pvp. it's person vs. person, and it usually results in one side being disuaded from continuing to play. that's what happens when you actively work to disrupt someones enjoyment of an activity. it's even against the eula, despite that it's not monitored, watched, or otherwise dealt with in any real fashion.when a playerbase is comprised 80% of people who enjoy bullying and pushing around other people, it is rather hard to remind them that it is not an acceptable activity.the same applies to botters. generally, the two groups are comprised of the same or like individuals. hackers and the like are no different.what do they, (hackers in fps or other games), enjoy most?deriding other players for their incompetence or lack of effectiveness.see the common trend?anyway, that's not really what we're here about, and is mostly a seperate issue, though it does affect the outcome of any marketing scheme.integrity.every developer needs integrity, to see the fruition of their ideas accepted by the common whole. marketing is typically targeted, and the choice in how it is targeted results in the type of customer it draws. what is the largest customer base?eve's playerbase is not growing, or accelerating in growth. it is stagnating, as players make their way to other things, and every step forward, sees an increasing number of losses, yet their are more active players at any given time, than i remember there being two years ago. what's the reason for this? are they bot's, or real players, or just multiple account's, or both? the latter i think, is true.why do people quit?"
5/3/2011,"sorry to say, mars, but your post is very wrong on so many levels that i don't even know how to respond to each point you've mentioned without breaking the eula. so, i'll just kindly ask you to stop posting because you are only embarrassing yourself.thanks.---about the subject:- increasing the available monthly buddy invites was a great idea. viral marketing - best marketing.- getting back to making trailers that are coming from inside the game world was a great move. trailers should continue to be like that. it won't hurt to have the little ""all scenes in this trailer were captured using in-game rendering engine"" title before the video. it helps presenting how eve really looks like (without having to download a massive client first to see it).- about bringing back old players that left the game... you can't do it by doing something like anomaly nerf. players that have left the game usually don't bother with ads about eve on other sites. those who have left know where to find the information about what's going on inside the game - the devblogs. and, honestly speaking, from grayscale's devblog to new forum fiasco, you must work hard to bring at least something that community really wants in order to attract old inactive players. old players haven't left because of the lack of the new content after all."
5/3/2011,"that's your opinion, and you are welcome to it. consider this though:players lose interest in eve, and move on to other games, whether they be new players on trials, or subscribers that have been with the game for some time.to answer my earlier question: why do players quit?lack of success.griefing.lack of budget available to pay for the game.nothing to do.bitterness over areas of the game that have been changed, and unwillingness to overlook or adapt to a new development.frustration, as a result of any or all of the above.if you can't get players to stay in the game, then what is the point of marketing? it costs money, time and resources to market a product.look here, and see the results of recent marketing. pay particular attention to the period following mid 2009, to late 2010 and 2011. check subscriptions 150k - 1m, under mmodata charts v3.2 on the left."
5/3/2011,"sorry if this is naive, but can't we just pay militia for military conquests (and fine the losers)? won't that incentivize them to attack and defend their complexes? how much you lose depends on how many npcs on your side that were killed. (presumably they aren't capsuleers, so the navies are hiring these militia to bolster their forces) same for rewards, get paid depending on the number of hostile npcs that are killed. that may take a little of the heat off pvp once npc civi navies show up in a fight, as there is money to be won/lost."
5/3/2011,"in the downtime frenzy when it still existed, both sides would have near perfect intel for an entire constellation at a time and 'good fights' were not happening more than once/twice per day.eve players are risk averse by nature so if they can outnumber the target they will. lets say you give out plex location and pilot name, rabbits are soon identified and ignored while fighters are swarmed which in turn makes them rabbits .. all the while the rabbits are closing plexes at will.if the aim is to close plexes (which it is for all standing grinding alts) then the life of a rabbit is the only sensible route .. in short: you cannot polish the current system to any kind of shine. it has to be deconstructed and rebuilt if it is to have any sort of meaning or value.you would need to make it pretty damn high pay to make it worthwhile, especially if timers are to stay .. isk/hr is all that matters to the people you would attract.note: you already get pretty good isk for offensive plexing by way of tags and loot just not a widely known fact."
5/3/2011,"that is not because eve players are genetically cowards. its because the game mechanics never reward anyone to engage in anything except blob warfare. the game mechanics proposed in this thread would make it so the strategy is no longer to blob up but to stay spread out and fight. again its really easy to make the fighting spread out. make a mechanic where people have to be at several places at the same time. just because ccp has never added that to the game doesnt mean it cant be done  or even that it would be difficult to do. rabbits wont be ignored but they will constantly be frustrated if they try to do what they do now. if you want to gain occupancy it will no longer be a good idea to form up a big blob. so you will no longer have blobs *chasing* a rabbit. the side that has pilots spread out throughout the entire fw regions will win the occupancy war. the best way to win would be to coordinate pilots throughout the entire war area! having separate squads that can cover say 7 systems each call this a sector or zone. these squads might be between 1-20 people. you dont need to go chasing anyone if they move into a different squads territory. the squad that is there already capping plexes in the area, can just hop over a jump or two and kick him out. you can stay put capping plexes in your sector or zone while the rabbit wastes time running around. the side that spends more time running instead of running timers will not win. if they run you let them run and continue to cap plexes. lets say the rabbit runs 10 jumps from you and goes into another 20 minute plex. you ignore him. when the intel pops up you can talk on vent and let your militia know that this person is a rabbit. that way your own militia will not need to send too many resources (good pilots) to kick him out. the *local* militia covering that sector can let him waste 15 minutes then make a jump or 2, kick him out and cap his plex. if he wants to go running several jumps and start another timer that would be fine let him. he is just wasting his own time not the time of people who want to fight. when he gets to new plex the intel will pop up again and someone in your militia can hop over a jump or 2 and kick him out again before he can cap a plex. they can run but they cant hide. no one needs to do any chasing and rabbits accomplish nothing."
5/3/2011,"if people can not fight for themselves in plexes they will not be as useful to the militia. this is because they will constantly need to pull pilots, that could otherwise be running plexes, to their defense. if one militia is bad at pvp and needs 3 people to kick out 2 of the opposing militia (same ship classes) then they will need a larger active militia. if your side is outnumbered this can of course be a problem. i dont think eve should change that. but there are things you can do. you can set up coordinated attacks in different regions. lets say the other side has a blob of 50 people but you only have 20 up in taff. well you can try to focus your 20 in frigates and capture minors. or you can use jump clones or shuttles and get your 20 in bses to cap majors in a distant system like tzvi. yes of course the smaller force will always be at a disadvantage but because there are these different sized plexes with ship restrictions the smaller side  if it is well organized and equipped can still bring a fight to different regions. allot of how this will play out is how fast can one militia be in the *right sized already fit* ships in a different region capping plexes! the better organized militias although smaller militia will have plexes capped across the universe before the bigger blobbier militia can organize resistance. also there can be other things that help smaller militias. lets say caldari have all of their systems occupied and already occupy half of the gallente systems. the mechanics could then start letting gallente have cruisers in minors. that way even if one side is outnumbered there can still be good fights. the storyline idea is that these last systems are true bastions of gallente loyalists so the gate engineers give secret intel to the gallente side to help them.i just ask that you think about what i am describing and ask yourself if it wouldnt be great. if you agree it would be great but think the op proposals wont bring that about then ask why and what would need to be changed."
5/3/2011,"in all honesty you underestimate the fortitude of the alt rabbits and the will of people looking for fights to chase them down.ankhesentapemkah used the +5 standings loophole to run all those plexes and she was never interested in fights. and damar griefed her constantly, but he was one of the only guys who has ever had the will to grief the rabbits on a consistent basis. nobody else wanted to waste their valuable game time chasing somebody around who didn't want to fight."
5/3/2011,"x gallentiuswould you agree that rabbits would rather not have their whereabouts broadcast to the opposing militia? if you agree then this change will not encourage being a rabbit, it will discourage that behavior. we may disagree about *how much* this will discourage the behavior. the only way to really know is to try it. but by creating mechanics that continually discourage that behavior we can get rid of it. the current system so strongly *favors* carebear/rabbit plexing that, of course, that is how its currently done. but this can change and it is really not that hard. please though, we have to stop blaming the players for achieving their objectives in a rational way. eve players will continue to rationally pursue their goals. we need *mechanics* such that when the game is played rationally it brings about allot of small gang pvp. currently hide and seek alt rabbit plexing is the rational way to win occupancy. if the *mechanics* change so that is no longer the case, people will stop doing it. but let us back up. before we talk about mechanics changes i really think we need to have a vision of what we want to happen when we log on in fw. otherwise we are just making proposals that will just lead us in circles. if we cant be clear about what we want a gaming session to be like, we shouldnt just be shouting out proposals that sound good. my vision is to log on and be immediately told where people are trying to hold plexes so i can go and fight for them. lose a ship? get in another and get back in the fight. keep going at it with whatever you can afford to throw at them. hopefully there will be some amount of reward to holding plexes to help defray the cost but for the rest i may need to use the credit card or do some carebearing. whatever. that is the pain that makes losses hurt, i understand that. the thing is, once i have endured that pain and i have ships placed strategically through out the war zone i want mechanics that bring about the fun! i want quality fights!i dont want to spend so much time grinding missions, so that i can stock up on ships, only to warp around for hours and eventually just lose them to blobs. i want to log in and if we are severely outnumbered i want to be able to have chances that a certain coordinated attacks can be pulled off by having the right ships at the right places so i can do something for the war effort, other than sit in a stations.if the other side has 50 in a blob and we have 20. lets say we get into frigates and go 15 jumps to a new system. they follow in frigates thinking we will do minor plexes there. surprise we have fully fit cruisers in that system so we can start running medium plexes!! they would then need to have cruisers nearby and hopefully we would be able to knock out some medium plexes before they can reorganize. if they do we can jump in bses. etc. if they come then we all jump clone back up to some other system and start running plexes there. again having coordination and logistical supplies would be a huge part of it. it is better to be on hand [at the decisive point] with ten men than to be absent with ten thousand. tamerlanesee i want the war to be more dynamic in this way. i want it to involve logistics and strategies and tactics. not only yeah we are waiting for our fc to finish a cigarette so we can get back in blob formation and see what we can fight. we will accomplish nothing other than hopefully find a good fight. again we can still have large fleets and i dont mean to put them down. but i think fw can offer something different *as well*. it can offer *fast paced* small gang pvp like eve has never seen! this is the vision i want to strive for. what do you say? is it worth trying to get a game where that sort of game play happens? if so, then lets figure out why our current mechanics dont lead to it and how we can change them to bring that about. i dont want the only option to be: get in a large fleet. i like large fleets too. but small gang pvp is what ccp has never given any love too. its time, and fw plexxing is how to do it."
5/3/2011,"while i can see a lot of flaws with this option i really wish some form of it was introduced. i started playing this game at a young age and made the terrible mistake of adding iceblade to the end of my name because i thought it was ""cool"" it's certainly not cool 7 years on. still it has convinced me never to get a tattoo"

5/3/2011,this should be a no-brainer.
5/3/2011,"i pretty much agree with everything said here.that is one of the big problems with pvp and ship combat in pve. too much clutter, not enough view, and way to far zoomed out, just to fight effectively. generally you have little or no idea what your ship orientation is, and less idea of what you are facing. you can't see the opponents ships, and you can't see yours. everything is just little crosses, bigger crosses, distant lightshows, colored tags, and your overview readout. the overview is useful in pvp as it is virtually your only usable tool for selecting targets, but of less importance in pve. large scale battles make it less useful, and more cluttered. clutter is definitely a problem. i refuse to drive a crappy, rusty car and would rather walk.we can't always choose where we live."
5/3/2011,"there are already keybinds in the game for basic drone commands... thank god. as a further improvement, how about you assign drones in your bay to a group, then drag that group out of the drone window onto a blank module button and anchor it there? presto, one click drone group launch/recall.can we have a keybind for open container? pretty please?how about a command for ""take all"" and a keybind to go with it? or even better yet, some way to combine these two.somebody mentioned moving the ""selected item"" functionality into a bar on the bottom of the screen. good idea, or better yet make it a toolbar that can be placed where you want it. this toolbar could be player controlled as to how many buttons it has and how big the buttons are, and also what commands are assigned to what button. drag and drop would be the preferred method, and you already have icon artwork for most of it from the current ""selected items"" window. any function that can be assigned to the toolbar should also have an equivalent keyboard shortcut, or can be assigned to one, for the game controller jockeys out there. the key point here is more customizable one-click or keyboard functionality, and less right click and scroll context sensitive carpel tunnel hell.better yet, kill two birds with one stone by building into the client a means of detecting and/or preventing client-side exploits like multi-function macros and bots. then make the ui open-source and let all of these folks out here build and share their own ui setups based on the underlying functionality. everybody wins, and ccp doesn't have to do the heavy lifting."
5/3/2011,"let team bff go through the big thread of things to fix, pull out 100 (or 200, or 50) individual items that they can fix and are willing to fix, then let the us prioritize them via voting. items are fixed in the order of most popular to least, with the understanding that there is no guarantee that items far down on the list will be fixed in the next few releases if ever."
5/3/2011,"more visual mission details. point to point objectives on a map instead of a wall of tiny text. incorporate the show info and links into the map, with po-up on mouseover text, to identify specific objectives.this might help with new player learning curves."
5/3/2011,"that last bit is actually against the eula. anyone who has a subscription, is not allowed to also have a trial, at any time thereafter."
5/3/2011,"methinks its also against the eula to have multiple accounts at all however there's no enforcement, discouragement, or even lack of encouragement and it's even accommodated for in some ways. and if really needed trial accounts can be upgraded essentially for free via referals, probally also against the eula... also no enforcement(and not really reliably detectable, even when taking no countermeasures against detection).a lot of eula terms tend to fall under the category of 'if/when we want/need to' and aren't even nominally enforced in most circumstances, let alone even making the attempt or having the ability to do so on any reasonable scale. i kinda wonder why they even bother, considering there's always a 'we can ban you anytime for no reason' line in there, but i suppose they gotta say what they may or may not ban you for somewhere."
5/3/2011,"all true i guess, but it would make it more of a pain and a chore to do, there by making people do it less. it's exactly like money laundering in real life. the laws make it diffucult for you to transfer money directly to al-qaeda. but some people or companies like haliburton get around it by buying and giving them goods etc or have offshore accounts with neutral parties like cayman islands, these i expect to be in game as well, you can find a neutral sec third party to move your money through. (thereby incurring a slight risk that they run away with your dirty cash). the idea is just because it won't dissuade everyone, it will make it time consuming enough that most people won't bother. except for the hard criminals, and for them they will get what needs to be done. this may also open up the market for trusted money lenders/escrow holders. the gnome's of zurich!"
5/3/2011,"actually, i don't think i ever meant it to unilaterally stop people from getting around the system. just make it enough of a pain for them so that they don't do it as easily, just like real laws in rl.yes you can item exchange ""crime gear"" but then one of your players is going to have to fly from high sec to low sec, for example. its a pain, and it takes time (which has a real isk value thanks to plex)."
5/3/2011,"okay, something contructive to add :)what about these amendments:0 status counts as '+' as far as sec status penalties are concerned. so you can't use new alt middlemen, without committing some crime first. but the sec status used for money transfer checking is that of the previous downtime, so you need to wait a day to use a new alt who just committed a crime so that he will be able to receive $ from -10 main.as he is now a - toon, moving money to + toon will cause sec penalty, dropping his sec status further, soon it will be unusable to move money to + toon due to costs, as described below.besides the sec penalty for transferring isk from a + player to a - status player, add a tax, that will tax a percent of the transferred funds depending on your status differential.for instance, -10 transfers to a -0.1 character, 9.9% ""criminal money moving tax""so for every point differential, you get taxed. maximum of 15% for -10 sending money to a +5 status person. (along with sec penalty in this case)these taxes only apply to transfers between - status characters. + characters sending to + chars pay no such tax. (but + to - do). this represents how much more costly it is to move money around in the criminal word (those swiss bank accounts don't come cheap) and includes the 'elbow greasing' fees to pay off the right people to cover the tracks of the money transfer.aforementioned money-laundering skill help reduce the sec penalty (for crossing money from - to + or vice versa)new criminal banking skill helps reduce the tax on moving money in the underground, -1% per level."
5/3/2011,"how about this:take your stupid idea, put it ina little box and bury it in the hart of a sun. i suggest tama."
5/3/2011,"why are people so scathing in these forums? pms?anyway, at the very least it identify whether or not this really is a problem, in the next qen, i would like to see some statistics on money transfers from good toons to bad toons (or vice versa) on the same account. i'm sure our chief economist should be able to come up with those numbers.for instance, if it is extrodinarily high that good + characters send money to - alts on the same account, that means that piracy isn't a self sustainable profession. and contrary to what some of you may think, i'm not anti-piracy. i am pro-capitalist. if the piracy profession is not supportable without funding from good low abiding alts, then that just means that the profession needs to be fixed, economically. its not fair to pirates to have to play a 'good' character just to fund his fun life in the criminal world. basically it amounts to the same principle as, contraband. why bother making laws that prevent the sale of boosters and drugs, (with associated penalties) or other laws that prevent the 'funding of crimes with clean money' (and by extension, clean economic activities) when we allow the biggest loophole of all in the prevention of the funding of crimes with clean money."
5/3/2011,"i respect that point imigo, it is clearly made and obviously reflects the true nature of people to which i agree. but using the same example, just because some people will always find ways around the rules, it doesn't mean we should abandon all attempts at making rules. if that were so, we should just get rid of the irs and collect taxes on the 'honor system' are there loopholes? yep, likely, which is why this assembly hall is a place where we can all bounce ideas around like adults. but dispite the loopholes that may be exploitable by the few doesn't mean it shouldn't apply for the majority. (in your example, just because the pirates engineered an ingenious method of ganking your friend, is that grounds for throwing away the sec status rules because they didn't work?)"
5/3/2011,"it's actually pretty clear, and the we can ban you anytime, is for those situations when they know and can't prove it. multiple accounts is not against the eula; it states as much in there. i know, because i read the damn thing 3-4 times, just to make damn sure.some of the eula isn't enforced, or not enforced fully. i know players start trials after subscription, and do it quite often. some even roll trial after trial out, while having an active subscription or two. it allows them to watch rookie chat, and use it for recruiting or various other purposes. it's pretty obvious, when someone continuously mails out corp invitations to multiple players who have just started playing on a new account or trial. even more so, when you know they don't mail out to new players, that are alt's on sub'd accounts. i've started a couple accounts in the last few months, and received the same mailouts on both of them, though only once per character.still, it's purely speculation on my part isn't it, given they could actually just be opening new accounts like i am. starting a trial with a sub is against the eula. second and following accounts must be legitimately purchased as retail boxes with game time, or bought off the eve online site, with the account purchase registration fee, for ~$19.95. contracts are horrible to read, and involve all sorts of ambiguous statements, but that much is clear, as are other things when carefully read."
5/3/2011,what kind of answer is is this. are you really a csm delegate? if you are i can see why the csm is worthless.
5/3/2011,a simple answer to an awful proposal that would require breaking every single aspect of eve?
5/3/2011,"whenever somebody makes such an over-arching general statement like this a kitten somewhere dies. seriously, it goes against the whole point of 'town hall' forums. every idea should be heard, and of you don't support it, then don't click on the support button. if you have *constructive* criticism, then please voice it, as it is welcomed. nothing is personal, so please try to keep the discussions professional."
5/3/2011,"and once again, accepting that contract will incur the sec hit. reading comprehension ftl. mars pretty much covered the trial part.apparently, the only thing they can do is flail in desperation by blowing things out of proportion because of their self-serving notion that they're somehow the center of the universe, that they're somehow above the laws and rules and that they should, for some reason, be automatically entitled to all reward and no risk/consequences. they know it will work and they can't let that happen so while they, in their ignorance and stupidity, troll the thread, they only bump it up for the rest of u to see their risk-aversion and inability to deal with even the slightest of consequences. and most likely, they'll still do so even after this."
5/3/2011,why do you think this is the biggest problem?
5/3/2011,"i think the point that's trying to be made is that in this game, you have wide freedom of choice to do different things, but actions have consequences. having alts that do unsavory things which are supported by isk made from legitimate business is fundamentally no different, from an rp standpoint, of character a hiring character b to do things which character a is unwilling or unable to do himself.even this can have consequences. there are corporations and alliances who don't like to have members who are connected to behaviors they don't approve of, and which do thorough background checks including checking player trade transactions in the wallet.in addition, as has been pointed out, the proposed mechanic is unenforceable without making tremendous changes to just about every way that players interact with each other in the entire game.i understand the sentiment behind this proposal. i recently returned to empire space during a transition period from one nullsec home to another, and i have to say highsec is distinctly more hostile than i remember it being a couple of years ago. the number of people leveraging the game mechanics to make paydays off of the average law-abiding empire citizen appears to have increased tenfold, based on the harassment i have personally experienced.we know that ccp wants to move players from empire to nullsec. they have stated that many times. so whether it's right or wrong, i seriously doubt we are going to see any changes to any of the game mechanics currently being used by griefers and gankers to pad their wallets and killboards at the expense of ""carebears"". this is doubly true now that ccp had to nerf their latest nullsec ""carrot"" of fully upgradeable pve space. the long term effects of such condoned hostility on the retention rates of new players could probably bear some consideration, however.imho, the biggest news here is that the op didn't receive a reasoned reply of this nature from our honorable csm membership, instead of a rudely curt response on the one hand, and the epeen fueled flame on the other. shame on them."
5/3/2011,"so like i said... not enforced... can't be enforced... on the internets that virtually means the rule doesn't exist. and even a grain of thought and a halfhearted attempt at detection countermeasures (like a basic proxy, plenty of those running around and since you don't actually care about the security of the throwaway account...) would render detection virtually impossible short of bringing in real-life law enforcement.////////////////////seperate thought///////////////////////overall it's more then a little counter productive to create essentially pointless game mechanics that would only encourage people to run amuck with your eula policies you can't feasibly enforce. when things degrade to the point of virtually punishing those willing to obey 'the law', and rewarding those who aren't, the 'rules' only serve as encouragement for themselves to be broken... the rapid spiral of the base hypocrisy of the situation can only lead to tears.all for an arbitrary proposal to make 'criminal' more like real life in a game. not to mention the founding theme of the game is a basic lawlessness (completly lawless in null), and any attempt to create abitrary strict enforcement game-wide is simply counter intuitive to the entire rest of the game. there's currently only 1 real strict enforcement in the game, and that's concord... and it's not even game wide, its set on a delay so you can kill people anyways, theft incurs no wrath beyond what somone can actually do about it, and scams are encouraged... i think you're playing the wrong game if you want strict enforcement of anything.i did rather like some of mars' concept of introducing some sort of rewards system to create a meaningful difference between high and low sec standing seeing as how creating meaningful differences actually adds depth to the game. on the other hand an arbitrary and unrealistic determination that criminals should be banned from interacting with non-criminals in virtually every way via magical rules that fell from the sky and exist somehow while not fitting with any other game element or theme to date... does not. ""they can still interact"" would be a pretty failtastic argument seeing as how that interaction by the nature of the proposals themselves, makes any interaction with a criminal involved, an interaction only between criminals.not to mention creating rules you admittedly know can be bypassed with only the hope of annoying people as they do so, is immensely crappy game design. at that point you've regressed to the point of creating rules simply for the purpose of annoying your players, that's generally known as a terrible and pointless idea.tl;dr no, that's stupid."
5/3/2011,"i think that this goes against the ""you have rights to what you kill"" principle. i think it would make the life of a salvager too easy, everyone would just end up being salvagers (when you consider how much training you need to fly a noctis vs a fully loaded pve battleship.)what salvagers should try to do instead is to engage the pveers that you scan down. ask for the right to his salvage, (for a price of course). i think that you will find that if you offer a fair price for the salvage, most pvers may just be inclined to give it to you instead of wasting their time to have to come back and scrub the site. (which is the intent of the salvaging profession i believe). to this end i think that loot and wrecks should be made blue after say 1 hours plus a random +-<30min (i thought this was already the case no?) but before this time they should be yellow. note, i said wrecks as well. i do believe that if a thief is tractoring your wreck with you present then you should be able to shoot them without concord. i know this is against current ccp policy, but hey this is a proposal afterall, and i think that with the addition of the 'all things go blue' after 2 hours rule, then i think its reasonable to shoot before the timer runs out. scanner should be able to find cans and wrecks after the 1 hour mark. this seems to me like closer to the expected behaviour, which is:a) if you are a salvager present during the pve battle, you should need to ask for permission to salvage from him (and give him money presumably for that right)b) if you are a salvager and you scan down a site which has been a marked 'abandoned' (pass the 1hour mark) then you should be able to salvage at will. 'live' battle sites can still be found, but you will be notified of such (perhaps use 'weak' and 'strong' fusion signatures as a story device)c) if you try to tractor/salv any wrecks while they are still yellow (before the 1h mark, or without the pve'er making it blue for you before the 1h), then you should be shot without consequence."
5/3/2011,"this. andthis. give mission runners more chance to aggress, not less! therefore not supported."
5/3/2011,"no. if i put in the effort in destroying the ship, then the wreck of said ship is mine and mine alone unless i feel generous enough to abandon it willingly."
5/3/2011,next objection please.
5/3/2011,"i think you have some good ideas. let me share my thoughts according to the numbers you use in this post:2) this is not *my* idea. it was posted in 2008 when ank posted she capped 111 plexes in less than a week without a single pvp kill. someone in that thread reached the obvious conclusion that this shouldnt happen and that the militias should be notified. like you i just added that persons idea to my post so it wouldnt get lost. the intel on plexes would not be broadcast to the militia channel it would be broadcast to a separate channel that no players can type in. it would just say something like cearain, entered, auga, minor, merlin, 9 mins pilots could refresh this list if they wanted to see whats going on otherwise the intel would just appear as plexes are entered or left.i addressed what would happen to rabbits in my assembly hall thread. it was a long winded post. but suffice it to say rabbits will not benefit from letting the other militia know where they are at. and anyone who thinks rabbits want the enemy to know where they are is horribly confused. if you want to avoid blobs you spread out the war zone as much as possible. having set front lines that blobs can camp is just a bad idea. spread out the objectives and you spread out the blob and get small gang warfare. this is really pretty easy.3) rats almost always discourage pvp. i cant tell you the number of times i had rats rip through half my shield tanked rupture before i even got in pointing range of the enemy and therefore had to warp out. rats are stupid and balancing them is a waste of time. also you cant fly the best pvp fits. you need some sort of active tank mod which is just stupid. if players dont want to fight for occupancy then they should lose. speed tanked frigates work against rats much better than they do against pvp ships. so again i think the opposite is true here. if there are no rats you dont need to fly a stupid speed tank or active tank ship. you can fly a ship that you would like to fly in pvp."
5/3/2011,"4) i really dont think we need to limit how many ships are in the plex. i would prefer not to do this. maybe 10 frigates would want to fight 2 cruisers in a medium. i think if we make use of the entire map and all the different size plexes then blobbing will not e an issue. there is simply too much ground to cover. i posted some ideas regarding your first idea in the features and ideas thread. im sort of neutral about it. will the button disrupt everyone on the entire grid or just within the button range? yes i am supporting this thread because it has good ideas that we should think about. notifying the militia of plexes being taken is an obvious one. until this is done fw will always be a joke. the other basic divide is between people who want occupancy to be a pve activity and those who want it to be a pvp activity. those who want it pve want better rats and more requirements to kill them. you seem to agree that rats should simply be done away with for occupancy. if you want to shoot red xs we have missions in faction war, belts, regular missions, sleepers in whs, incursions, anomalies, pirate missions etc. please just keep them out of fw plexes  let the players win or lose that war in pvp."
5/3/2011,i'm interested to know this too.
5/3/2011,i'm curious to know what's going on too.
5/3/2011,i asked some ccp dev about this at fanfest and all i got as reply was a shrug and a referral to petitions...
5/3/2011,"i don't know what you lot are on about, i have received several tower bpcs as loot dropped in recent months...not supported. rng rules!"
5/3/2011,"then your the only one, also i demand pics or proof of some kind as i do not believe you.keep bumping ppl"
5/3/2011,"don't really give a **** as to whether you believe me or not! you can demand, but all i give to you is /fingerconsider this a free bump for your whine thread."
5/3/2011,don't feed the troll.
5/3/2011,"yes, please. moreover, please do it asap. i would say: include it in the first small patch, please. p.s.shame on me, but i should to confess: i once kill friendly logistics just because there was no way to identify its intentions."
5/3/2011,csm proposal raised for your comments.
5/3/2011,"delete this post, wrong forum. thank you."
5/3/2011,"hi, my name is axemaster. after fighting solo in lowsec for over a year, i decided to wardec people in highsec. but i have a teeny tiny problem.my name always shows up blazing red at the top of the local list!as you might imagine, this makes it very hard to sneak up on people in high sec and kill them. fortunately, there is a simple two part solution!1) add an option to make your name appear at a random position within the local list. that way people whose names start with ""a"" don't get screwed over permanently based on the spelling of their name.2) add the ability to search local, just like we can already search our cargo hold. additionally, make it so that you can right click in the local search bar and have a nice little menu appear showing any online contacts currently in system (but you have to click to bring it up - it doesn't just refresh on it's own).please, let's correct this unfair mechanic. it unbalances the game and the fix is simple.tl;dr - people whose names start with the letter ""a"" are at a huge disadvantage in highsec wars since they are spotted instantly by their targets. this is unfair since names can never be changed. we need the option to scramble the position of our names in local to fix this problem."
5/3/2011,"would be nice to get rid of local all together. i know its been a dream for 8 years, but still."
5/3/2011,"yeah. in the meantime, please support this thread!this is kind of a fundamental game imbalance. it probably wouldn't take a dev longer than a few days to fix it, and a lot of people would benefit."
5/3/2011,"that's not an ""imbalance"". i know exactly how you feel, but i can't support this.local is just fine as it is."
5/3/2011,title says enough i think.t2 strip miners detect the target they are activated at and automaticly switch mining cristals to the needed type. simple and effective. how many times does it hapen that you forget to switch crystals and mine a roid with the wrong crystal verry anoying realy.i think this solution can be implemented without to much reprogrammingbecause a target type detection is allready in eve.
5/3/2011,less work for bot coders?
5/3/2011,"[sarcasm]and people thought mining couldn't get any more boring. [/sarcasm]if veldspar crystals did not work for another ore than i might support this. since it's only a matter of losing the specialized bonus i don't.my missiles launchers don't auto-load the best missile for my target, why should my strip miners?"
5/3/2011,"i think you just topped him (not that there was anything particularly wrong with his statement in the first place). it would need to be a bit more than ""no social life"" to enable you to play 23.5/7 (and that's assuming you don't stop at all for bodily needs), as for the insomniac, i believe that after a certain period of absolutely zero sleep you wouldn't be able to even play eve (probably end up crazy). what ccp's hitting is the accounts that are online and active (read: not afk) from dt to dt continuously for days / weeks on end, something which could not be accomplished without breaking at least one of the rules set out in the eula.perhaps i'm stupid for even responding to this troll :/"
5/3/2011,"account sharing is against the eula for a reason, and it is not sharing it with your kids. same client, same ip, same family, not some stranger who is potentially going to steal your account or do something that results in you being banned.people who share their accounts with their kids are fine in my book, and i don't see a problem with it. picking on that is completely inane. whatever the op's honesty, this thread doesn't have to be trolled, simply because it looks like 'fair game'.i'm sure ccp would have no more problem with the idea of sharing your account with your kids than me, and if you read the eula, i'm pretty it tells you why account sharings is a bannable offense. it's a security risk, and potentially a way for rmt's to farm isk with one account and multiple computers in different locations. for the sake of argument, this is a parent with kids. would you say no, if your child asked you if he or she could play? if you do, you're either a shmuck, or a concerned parent. if you're a concerned parent, turn the computer off, and go spend some time with your kid(s). wtf"
5/3/2011,"ccp doesn't have a problem with that, but it will hold the owner responsible for everything that happens on that account, so if you want to be safe, don't share your account with anyone. it's pretty clear the op is full of **** though, so i'm not sure why that would matter in this case.for the sake of argument i think you should let the kid have a trial account and if he likes the game, pay for his own account. there is no need to share accounts, especially since you can only train a single character at a time, so account sharing doesn't work that well in any case. if you can't afford another payed account, let him play a f2p game. it's not like there isn't any lack of free mmos in the world. if a character is actively online doing things 23.5/7, it's a macro or a sweatshop, and i'm pretty sure there are ways to determine pretty conclusively which one it is and it was likely done already. we are just seeing a macro user/troll trying desperately to come up with an excuse for his behavior and no one is taking his explanations seriously.either way this is something that belongs in a petition. by trying to get a mob going against ccp the op made himself a free target for ridicule."
5/3/2011,it is blatantly obvious that the op is full of ****. ccp doesn't ban a person for being logged on and playing 23.7. if they did that drf wouldn't still be here. he obviously did something he shouldn't have and is just trying to incite hate against ccp.
5/3/2011,the only way to fix the bounty system is to tie it into a players skill points. nothing else will work in eve.
5/3/2011,why? why is it a good idea to be able to grief someone down to 0 sp?
5/3/2011,what part of fairness dont you understand? of course their would be checks and balances. maybe one would be a player who has bounty and is killed can not have another bounty until so much time has passed. were not talking thousands of points lost per bounty. maybe 1000 or less per billion dollar bounty. this would determined by ccp for fairness.
5/3/2011,"sorry, what exactly is the problem you are trying to solve here? can you provide a link to any previous discussion you may be referring to?"
5/3/2011,"what? a bounty on people's skillpoints?!?!?! i first read this as a system tied to skillpoints (ie more skillpoints = more isk bounty) which could be acceptable if you actually proposed the way of doing it.but a bounty to take out people's skillpoints is just terrible. the bounty system should encourage pew pew, not discourage it.a bounty system tied to the value of a player's ship would be far more workable. a system where the bounty hunter gets a portion of (say half) the value of the destroyed ship and mods, paid from the bounty on a player's head would work much better. that way people are encouraged to go out and fight pirates and more pew pew gets to happen."
5/3/2011,"greetings members of the csm and my fellow eve players. for a long time i have looked at the capital ships of eve (not including super caps) and wondered, ""why only two types?"" well, i have an answer for that. what i propose is a sub-dreadnought capital ship geared towards killing off battleship and battle-cruiser sized vessels. a ship which would still run capital repair modules, but not be able to preform siege or triage functions. instead of utilizing capital weaponry it would be limited to large weaponry (large turrets or cruise/torpedo bays) with a damage bonus to assert it's position as a capital class ship. for instance, a caldari ship would have 8 highs (8 launcher slots) 7 mediums, and 4 lows. it's skill bonus would provide it with a 15% damage bonus to kinetic missile damage per level. also as a capital they would be limited to using an internal jump drive and would not be able to activate a standard star gate. i understand my idea would need polishing before it was ever placed in game, but i believe this would add some more depth to the rather bland capital side of the skill tree and ship market."
5/3/2011,agree with this would be great to have something ( reminds me of the orca ) but for combat still a cap but able to perform that role in between bc bs sounds cool to me.
5/3/2011,"machariel comes to mind, or rattelsnake"
5/3/2011,macharials and rattlesnakes are battleships that are not designed to hold up to the sustained damage that this ship class would be built to take.
5/3/2011,yea! this sounds awsome... would add a bit more variety to fleets...
5/3/2011,stupid idea. carriers and supercarriers are already tremendously proficient at killing off subcaps and you want to introduce another class to further cement the idea that anyone who uses stargates is a second class citizen worthy only of providing easy killmails to the ubermenschen in their capital ships.cap fleets and supercap fleets should be vulnerable to subcaps unless they are properly supported. this suggestion runs counter to that basic balance concept.how would removing the need for any subcaps except cyno alts from a fleet 'add a bit more variety'?
5/3/2011,no he wants a carrier's defense without triage in an expensive hull without the capital remote reps etc.
5/3/2011,not supported. this would effectively remove sub-capitals from the battlefield.

5/3/2011,ccp should consider attaching reinforced support processes to fleets themselves -- either at pre-registration or after the fleet grows to a certain size.systems are often unpredictable for manuevering fleet fights outside tournaments...unless the attacker achieves significant surprise. by attaching the support directly to the fleet resources can be scaled to fleet size and be in the correct location for a fight. the main complexity being the combining of resources when two or more fleets begin to meet and exchanging generic object location with local star system processes. to keep data exchange with local star systems simple members of such fleets could be prohibited from non-fleet combat activity while in large fleets. no mining. no docking at stations. no market information. etc. only major system features for navigation and ships. it would be easy enough for fleets to drop out a few players to shop or whatever else is not supported in fleet - then allow rejoin. the additional process(es) when two or more fleets meet could be held in reserve for other task like cases where the battlefield begins to drift apart or have multiple separate locations possibly in two systems. like where local pilots are station camped in an attempt to prevent their rearming and rejoining the main battle elsewhere. or like where defenders hit an attacking fleet passing through a gate from both sides - two systems battle.anyway the key load on local star systems would then be exchanging generic information on targets present for indpendents not in either fleet before they attempt to join in battle or ninja salvage.
5/3/2011,"it's a huge pain for a corp, especially one based out of 0.0, to unrent offices all over new eden. i suggest we add the ability to unrent the offices remotely. as a fail-safe, i suggest the offices become ""unrented"" at the end of the office billing cycle. in addition, a notification should be generated stating that someone has initiated the office removal similar to how the billing notifications are generated today. this hopefully help people avoid getting assets in impounded."
5/3/2011,"buffing up a cruiser to be able to effectively fight a ship ten times its size and dozens of times its cost is just absurd. the main role of a hic was always sub-capital fleet warfare. being able to tackle supercaps was just a neat secondary function they could do back when supers were motherships and did no damage, and when titan doomsdays were laughably weak.times have changed though, and that's why i think we need a different solution.both of these would affect its capabiltiies in the sub-capital battles that make up the hictors' primary role. the neut immunity just doesn't make sense. supers and titans are immune to ewar and you can still nuet them, and sieged dreads can also be neuted. a cruiser being randomly immune to a specific type of ewar that even ewar-immune ships are vulnerable to just seems odd.i think you'd need a specialty ship for this role. either a new class of capitals, or tech-2 dreadnoughts."
5/3/2011,"why not increase the sp/h rate?... it would keep a lot more players... 1 month to x rather than 2 months to x...there are enougth skills to keep people busy, even at double the sp/h rate... people dont just play eve for that next skill book...why not increae the sp/h rates rates across the board by either reducing the multiplier on skills or add things like +7 implants...in either case, the change is trivial... unless those who have ran out of skills that interest them get annoyed with some noob getting faster sp/h than they did 5 years ago...i want to see more players stick around, and i want to see eve stay with its unique skill system, but the base or adjusted rate of sp/h is not some holy grail that needs to be protected at all costs...more skills completed in shorter amount of time equals more players... exactly the same train of throught which led to the removal of the learning skills...only been playing 18 months so my view isnt that important..."

5/4/2011,"i don't know if it's possible to clear the acrimony here.the concept of suicide ganking being essential to the eve economy... is lulz.trying to call removing insurance on concorded ships anything but a nerf on suicide ganking, is equally lulz.the point is this: a suicide gank gang kills my t2 fitted hulk with 3 t1 fitted destroyers. they use a covops pilot in an npc corp to provide a warpin point. by the time i realize anything is up, my ship is dead.the 4th dessie takes out my pod, full set of +4's and mining yield implant toast. covops pilot scoops the wrecks and runs.their loss: around 1.5 million isk, 2 million tops. one strip miner ii costs more than that. to add insult to injury, their hulls are insured. insurance on a t2 mining barge? lolmining in high sec on medium ores with a hulk and an orca i'm using two accounts to generate 15m isk an hour, if i'm lucky. it takes me 20 hours of play time to replace the loss.the gankers, on the other hand, only need one t2 module to drop to turn a profit. and if they care about their sec status, it takes them maybe 5 hours in a stealth bomber to fix it. most of them don't care, they just use an npc alt to drop a fitted ship in system for the -10 guy to pick up.and of course, the gankers are adamant that there is absolutely nothing wrong with this risk/reward ratio. and why wouldn't they? everything is in their favor. in their view of the universe, anybody not playing the game the way they think it should be played is a loot pinata.we won't even get into the arena of the us vs. them ""carebear"" name calling schoolyard bully attitude that seems to have pervaded the game over the past couple of years. what everybody knows, and what nobody will say, is that most suicide ganking is not rp piracy but mildly tolerated random ""carebear"" griefing. and just because it doesn't meet ccps eula definition of ""griefing"" doesn't mean that's not what it is. alpha popping the dumbass carrying a cap parts bpo in a shuttle in niarja is one thing. using the same mechanic to inflict grevious loss on some unsuspecting pilot minding their own business ""because you can"" is something else again.we know the situation will never get ""fixed"". fixed would be:1) transferrable kill rights. gank my industrial player, my ""bounty hunter"" of choice is coming after you. hopefully, when you are flying something expensive. things would be a little different if pilots could have some reasonable fear of having the shoe on the other foot, hmmm? since most gankers are purpose built alts this has less utility than it might seem, but player justice is the best kind and the current system is lopsided against pilots not specialized in combat.2) make security status something meaningful. less than -7? you can't even pass through a highsec gate anymore. lower yourself to less than -7 inside a highsec system? better hope your medical clone is in lowsec so you can destruct your pod back home, or get ready to do a lot of belt ratting. this will solve the issue of -10's flying around in pods until it's time to do the dirty deed, and jump into a ship handed off from a ""safe"" npc corp alt or kicked out of an orca. oh and ccp supposedly doesn't condone killing pods in empire, so killing a pod is an automatic -10. no matter where you started.3) make security status harder to earn back. system hopping in a stealth bomber killing one battleship rat in each nullsec system for a few hours is not even a fair trade for the dirty deeds being done. introduce a metric that reduces the positive status gained for every npc kill, for each negative ""incident"" the pilot has in the past 90 days. what? unfair? you want to be a pirate, then go live in lowsec.4) fix the bounty system. how does it serve anyone to have a game mechanic that's a joke? since we know none of these things are going to happen, all we want is to remove the insult from the injury. no insurance payouts for gankers."

5/4/2011,"farms and fields: there is already a mechanic in use in the game to attack farms and fields, and it just got a lot more powerful again since most alliances now have their most valuable space concentrated into a very few low truesec systems easily pinpointed on dotlan. it's called cloaky afk camping, where a player leaves a cloaked ship (and the threat of a cyno hotdrop) basically afk in a system for days, even weeks. this is a widely discussed and widely used tactic to attack the morale and economy of your opponent. the problem i have with it is this: it should not be possible for any player to accomplish anything of any value unless he is actively at his keyboard playing his character. afk cloaky camping is the same thing as botting in this sense and needs to be nerfed. hard. either put a module timer on cloaks so you can't afk your ship in space until next downtime, or introduce some probes into the game that can detect cloaked ships, albeit with long scan times or some other similar difficulty. neither one hinders an active pilot much but puts an end to the afk camping posthaste.i'm all for having a legit way of doing this instead, that even small gangs can accomplish. having ""raiders"" being able to accomplish something returns much of value to the game, including penalizing large power blocs for concentrating all of their forces in one system. right now there is little risk to such tactics, since system sov can't be decided decisively in a short period of time (and it shouldn't be). but somewhere in this game the usefulness of small, mobile raiding fleets has been relegated to the level of ""i'm bored, let's go roam and see if we can kill something"", and i think that's a shame.some of the better and easier ideas involve making existing structures vulnerable to disruption by smaller units than sov warfare fleets. ihubs and certain station services like refining and production are excellent targets for disruption. disrupt pirate entrapment? no anoms spawn until it's fixed. disrupt an ore prospecting array? the system suffers a certain percentage of backslide in industry activity. these are just examples that would need balancing, and also possibly a limit placed on how many times these structures can be vulnerable in a downtime period. having these structures vulnerable to disruption through a different method than hp prevents ""blob"" vulnerability, gives defense fleets time to form and react, and could give the archeology and hacking skills and modules a new lease on life. once caveat: no more than one module per ship, if having more modules active has an effect on the amount of time. we don't need to give rise to specialized ""disruption"" fits and ships. make the attacking gang trade off a midslot per ship for how much faster they want it to move, and put a limit on it, say 10 modules or so. i'm just freeform brainstorming here but you get the idea.two more ideas more industrial based: minerals and ores are going to have to be fixed soon anyway. in case nobody has noticed, the price of mega and zydrine are tanking fast, and there's nowhere to look but all of the new miners mining abc in gravi sites in rental nullsec systems. there's way more of these high end minerals hitting the market now than demand needs, so either blueprints need to be updated, abc rocks need to be nerfed, or make high end ores more valuable because of the mix of minerals they refine into, not that they provide an overabundance of a particular rare thing that can overflow the market. this introduces more low end minerals into nullsec, which is what builders need to build there for the local market instead of importing. at the same time, it's past time that reprocessing got nerfed. it's ridiculous to me that anything can be recycled into its components and then rebuilt with no loss. you should never, with perfect skills and location, be able to retrieve more than 90-95% of what went into something when you recycle it."
5/4/2011,"some pretty simple things here, like someone already noted them before:balance 0.0 > low sec > high sec in percentages. high sec only drops 25% of nullsec ores, low sec 50%. add more trash minerals to high-end ores. forcing a player to mine veldspar in 0.0 sites is just dumb.comet mining. they don't need to fly around in space or whatever, but damn, let players mine moon minerals.moon mineral spam. double the number of tech moons, just mirror the north to the south. or something like that. i do like the high amount of valuable moons, but spread even more of them, so individual corps can run their own full reaction chains im 0.0."

5/4/2011,"i would think this would be a no-brainer.i disagree with the poster who thinks ccp has something against drones due to lag. lag is only really an issue with heavy concentrations of player ships, like fleet battles. i think the issue is more along the lines of ccp not wishing to create parity with a weapon system that can run more or less automatic, for fear the level 4 mission hubs would be crowded with multi-boxed afk-domis. simple solution: give drones some love, and remove the ""focus fire"" command. let drones run on automatic, but if you want them to kill anything in an organized and efficient fashion, you need to be directing them from one target to another.honestly, i don't see what some implants would hurt, either way.supported."
5/4/2011,"apparently the mining foreman mindlink is only available as a reward for doing the level 4 storyline mission ""shipyard theft"", and then it's random which mindlink you get.the incursion 1.0.0 expansion dumped ""over 20 new level 4 storyline adventures"" into the mix. debate about nerfing level 4 missioning aside, one of the results of diluting the pool of storyline missions is that the supply of mindlinks has shrunk considerably. the price of a mining mindlink is spiking rapidly, recently passing 300 million isk. all of the market hubs show a marked drop in units sold to match the price spike, seeming to confirm the price spike is caused by a serious drop in availability.some of us are wondering if this is a case of unintended consequences, and if so could we please see a fix? maybe add it to industrial oriented npc lp stores, like the prospector implants."
5/4/2011,"all the mindlinks have spiked over the past few months. i remember back in the day when i'd reprocess them because they just weren't worth dragging to a trade hub and later on swapping them out of my ganglink alt rather than clone jumping. those days are long gone however and while i'm not opposed to them costing a bit more, it is getting a bit crazy. i've also noticed a massive decrease in the price of pretty much all other implants and lp too. not sure what's going on but something got thrown out of whack a few months ago."
5/4/2011,"yes i believe that level 4 storyline mission is also the primary supply, if not only supply, of all of the mindlink implants, meaning all of them have gotten a lot more rare. i think there is not nearly the demand for the other mindlinks as there is for the mining foreman one, so it is the one that is most notably spiking on the market.even at 40-50m isk, the extra 5% yield takes a good while to make a return on investment, unless you are boosting huge mining fleets, in which case you are just helping your corpmates most likely, not seeing a personal benefit. at the prices this item is rapidly approaching, it's becoming more of vanity item than something that makes economic sense.example: 2 hulks with an orca booster is a reasonable scenario for mining multi-boxers. max skills all around with t2 crystals mining arkonor, the implant makes a difference of around 16 pieces of ore per cycle per hulk, or around 13,500 m3 per hour. at this rate, which is close to an ideal scenario for a single player, it would take 100 hours of mining to pay for the implant at current prices. if you boosted more hulks the number drops, but then those hulks are not very likely to be yours, and it's almost impossible that larger groups will be mining arkonor all the time. they will be clearing gravi sites in null or wh space most likely, in which case the value of 5% drops considerably.i'm seriously hoping this is not what the devs had in mind. unintended consequences, hopefully."

5/4/2011,"support generally rebalancing gallente ships and hybrid weapons. the two will have to be done together to insure it's meaningful without creating another flavor of the year op setup.make damping where it can't reduce locking range below 10km? what? the race that uses the shortest ranged weapons fields an ewar system that isn't effective inside their optimal, this makes much sense. if the universe was an orderly place, gallente would field jammers and caldari would damp, instead of the other way around.one of the underlying problems i see that nobody has touched on is that gallente have no choice at all in the type of damage they deal, like amarr, but unlike amarr em/therm, kinetic damage is one of the highest base resists for shield and armor across the board in the entire game. when you get into t2 hulls this becomes even more so. there are certainly issues with fitting, bonus', speed, and penalties that need to be addressed on various hulls, as well as tracking and what not, but lets not forget that everything in the game is more resistant to gallente base damage type than anything else.one way or another, gallente need some love."
5/4/2011,"have to say that i agree with most of what julius has said thus far. it is very clear that he has quite a bit of experience when it comes to flying and fitting gallente ships of a wide variety of classes.it is very clear that as a whole, blaster platforms are not competitive on the same level as matari or ammarian ships when it comes to pvp. there are of course exceptions to the rule such as the taranis, vindicator, and to a lesser degree the vigilant(primary). the problem i believe stems from a number of issues stated a zillion times in every thread. blaster ships are easily kite-able, hard to fit, and lack the real world dps to be chosen over ac or pulse boats in the majority of pvp encounters. what we need to do is address the primary issues and i believe that julius foederatus' first post illustrates these very well. we need better relative fitting, slightly better speed, and imo increased drone bay size (not badnwith) to allow some flexibility in the extremely inflexible environment blaster ships work in.further more i'd like to focus on the both the astarte and brutix. both of these ships need improvements as do all the tier 1 bcs and field commands. due to my lack of extensive experience with anything but gallente bcs and the astarte i'll keep my points directed towards them although i think universally all field command should be given full t2 resists just like hacs, afs, and fleet commands. the astarte and brutix each need another low slot, pure and simple. if a ship is going to be stuck with an armor rep bonus then it better have enough lows to take advantage of this bonus. the astarte like all field commands should be given a raw hp buff to give them more hp than their relative tier 1 or even tier 2 counterparts, i do not understand why almost all other t2 ships have more hp than their t1 variants where t2 bcs have less. these two ships should also be given another 25m3 dronebay to allow 1 wing of meds and 1 wing of lights to be carried."

5/4/2011,"thank delsie, yes, that was my point exactly. i know of more than 1 beginner that i brought on who quit before their trial ran out because he just kept on getting ganked. it is too bad though that i think you are right in the sentiment in ccp is to not change these game mechanics because they don't believe it's an exploit. my point was to put to discussion that they actually 'are' exploits by way of inconsistently enforced laws, and to propose an idea on how it may be fixed. it needs a lot of refinement, as a lot of you have pointed out, but i think through collective discussion, it has become something better than my initial one. thanks for everyone who contributed. even though it looks like it will never get any attention by ccp or csm. rented, not sure what you mean by 'interact'. if you mean communication, then this is absolutely *not* part of the proposal. only money transfers. if by technically hard to implement... i don't see why you think this? i thought it would be a simple dt task to go over the 'player donation' transactions in the wallet, apply penalties. yes you can still contract goods, but as i mentioned before, this extra part of 'getting the goods moved around' is a pain that these people who are 'getting around the sec status penalties' need to pay. it doesn't cause any pain for regular players, only those which are funding crime.one thing i'm not sure about is really how often do you find yourself transferring $ to - toons or vice versa? now how many of those times were either a) moving cash from a ganking job to your high sec industrialist alt to buy shiny things (making use of dirty money) or b) sending cash to your - status ganker alt to pop a fellow indy. (funding crime with clean cash)if most of the cross-status money transfers are not of this kind, then i will agree that these new rules aren't necessary. otherwise, i think we have a problem*, which this solution is just one of many that we can think of to solve it. (but feel free to suggest others, i think mars did, and i do see merit in that approach as well, i would support that)*the actual problem being that isk transfers is an exploit to get around sec status penalties for crimes."
5/4/2011,"i was mostly referring to anna's insane, extreme, and bad additions to your proposal. your original proposal is rather mild and even if i don't particularly care for it, at least isn't plain awful like anna's rabidly anti-red ideas for 'rules' prohibiting all interaction with reds in contract/trade/market/in-space/etc/yougettheidea which would apparently even extend into nullsec despite there technically being no one there to enforce it... well it just doesn't make sense in general.and i suspect the vast majority of cross-security transfers are from highsec alts to people who live in lowsec where you can scarcely do anything aside from lose sec status. seeing as how lowsec is already nearly worthless, i personally see no need to nerf it further... unless of course i simply hate reds, but that's not a terribly good reason."

5/4/2011,"not supported. afk travel is already ridiculously slow in a freighter. how about increase the base velocity, lose the speed bonus, and give it a warp speed bonus. that will benefit both afk and atk pilots. the time spent aligning is roughly 40 seconds, with the best skills and implants you can get it down to around 20. so you're only saving something in the realm of 10 to 12 seconds per jump with your proposed bonus. the bulk of time is spent in warp or, if you're afk, moving towards the exit gate."

5/5/2011,"some interesting posts in here so far. here's what i'd like to see.1) destroy the tier system for frigates through battlecruisers, per the proposal linked early in the thread. having tiers just doesn't make sense anymore now that isk is much easier to acquire than it was back in 2003. remove tiers, boost the capabilities of the lower tiers to the top tier, and increase build costs to the top tier.2) examine the ship lineup to ensure that all ships serve a distinct role for their race.3) revamp gallente. most people point to hybrid weapons, especially blasters, as a major reason why gallente currently suck. one of the devs said that blasters were meant to fill the short-range/high-damage weapon role and they still work fine in that role. i mostly agree that the problem is not blasters, but the ships they are fitted to. however, there are some tweaks that should be made to blasters, mainly a slight boost in tracking. it's absurd that autocannons out-track nearly all of their blaster counterparts considering the enormous differences in range. i also love the idea, presented earlier in this thread, of making blasters a low rof/high alpha weapon. this would certainly add some flavor to short range weaponry as that role doesn't currently exist. finally, since blasters are so sensitive to range changes, reduce their reload time to 5s so they have a bit more flexibility to adjust to different ranges.for blasters to be effective, they need to be on ships that can get to their target quickly and hold them while they apply their dps. several game mechanics changes have made this task far more difficult than it was in the past, especially for larger ships, namely the speed/agility nerf, the web nerf, and the warp scram buff. compounding the problem is the fact that buffer tanking has become increasingly necessary to counteract the larger groups of enemies that one faces now compared to the past. since armor buffer tanks reduce speed and agility, the problem just gets worse. here's how i propose to fix blaster-focused ships:blaster ships require speed and agility. armor tanks reduce speed and agility. therefore, blaster ships should not armor tank. minmatar are a mixed-tank race, so we know it can work. gallente should be a mixed-tank race, too. change the following ships to be shield tankers: thorax, deimos, brutix, astarte, megathron, and possibly the hyperion. (changing the hyperion would mean that there would be no active-tanking armor battleships and, with the exception of the rigs, at least it can active tank without losing much speed and agility.) for those ships, swap low and mid slot count, swap armor and shield amounts, change ship bonuses where needed (like astarte's armor rep bonus), and adjust powergrid and cpu to account for the change. that simple change will make the ships far more agile and also leave more low slots available for damage mods to help the ships fill that high damage role.focus on making gallente the most agile race. acceleration and short sprints are more important than top speed. if a blaster boat has to travel long distances, it's probably going to die anyway either from a lack of capacitor, or simply that it cannot make up the damage difference once it finally gets into range. minmatar should still be the fastest race, but gallente should be most agile to help fit their role. in addition to boosting base agility or reducing mass, other ship bonuses could be introduced to boost agility, like a reduction in the mass addition from mwds and afterburners.fitting ability on many gallente ships seems to assume that blasters are still king of the hill, so they can be hard to fit. the hyperion is the best example of this: single rep + 8 neutron blasters, + mwd + cap injector = 15% over power grid capacity. that's just ridiculous compared to the other tier 3 bs, especially the abaddon. gallente fitting requirements should be reviewed."
5/5/2011,"1. the tier system is there for a reason and its not just for isk cost... you really want a bb to have the same hp as a moa/caracal? so the tier system should stay... but i will agree on simular ships that are combat should have the tier system removed... like moa/caracal or drake/ferox... 2. cant argue with that, suported3. i like that you liked my idea about atry blasters... but dont forget rails too they also blow... the other day i was in a drake fleet in a rail thorax and i was doing something 300 alpha on the other drakes... either increase alpha on rails or make them high dps long range autocannonsi also like the idea of a 5 second reload time...4. both us think gallente need to be faster/agile but i still think gallente should be armor...for me the way to achieve faster gallente should be in bonuses to the mwd... 1st reduce the mass of all gallente ships2nd change the cap reduction bonus and 10% to fall off to a mwd mass addition reduction... make it 10% per lev... now you have fast agile gallente ships3. remove the tanking bonus from gallente ships and replace with w 10% to armor amount per lev... now you wont have to put on so many trimarks/1600's to havge good ehp...4. if you are going to fix the speed isues and boost blasters/rails there is no need to fix fitting issues as it would more then likely make gallente op..."

5/5/2011,"i would like capitals and super-capitals to be redesigned with a combined fleet composition in mind. there are several ideas/proposals floating around. i liked the one that discussed the creation of separate fighter/fighter bomber and sub-cap drone bays. the idea was to decrease the amount of large to small drones that a super-carrier could vomit forth. i did not like the idea of decreasing the amount of fighters and fighter bombers they could carry. i see this as their role. some other ideas i have been tossing around include:a) remove all of the logistics bonuses from super-carriers. carriers should be your capital logistics backbone.b) give super-carriers another role. this could be in the form of ship bonuses that act as command bonuses for capital ships only (dread, carrier, super-carrier, and titan only).c) allow dreads to move under normal power in siege mode. they are still disallowed from warping and jumping. (although i would be amenable to allowing them to warp around on grid as long as the energy to warp increased substantially with distance. this would allow them to warp around tactically on grid, but they would not be able to warp any further without dropping out of siege mode.)d) allow dreads to receive remote repair from capital repair modules only. place a diminishing returns on this repair amount.e) triage mode will still paralyze carriers. i know you think this is unfair, but it would add a layer of tactical depth. triage and root yourself in place but receive more repair? or forgo triage and stay mobile. it would also make carriers that do not make good triage platforms viable.i would like to see combined fleets of carriers, dreadnoughts, super-carriers, and titans slugging it out. you can do what ever you have to in order to make this possible. please."

5/5/2011,i like the ideas to disrupt ihub upgrades but most of the ideas make the upgrade back active after repairing itthat will just mean that the owner waits until the gang is gone and then get a few carriers/logi's on it and its back upi think that to be of any effect you should leave the upgrades offline for like 24 hours that way the locals will try to defend it instead of repairing it when the enemy is gonethat would result in more small gang fights as it's hard to get a huge fleet together in the short time you have to safe the upgrades from going offline
5/5/2011,"i may have been unclear, but i stated that ""this will persist for a minimum duration."" the reasons listed above are exactly why i did this. if i can just repair the target up, i will pos up until the enemies have gone. 24 hours might push the worth of some of these upgrades too low though. if they can be taken out by a small (5-20) person gang, there is the very real possibility that they would be down a significant amount of the time due merely to time zone warfare. increasing their ehp would defeat the goal to create meaningful small scale warfare in null sec space. i lean towards a duration somewhere between 3, 6, 9, or 12 hours. i favor one as long as 3 hours but shorter than 6, but someone else may want to do the math on this problem."

5/5/2011,"in all likelyhood, ccp probally regards missions as having partially ruined the game... not that they're bad, just that many others things they actually want you to do are poorly designed. but at this point missions are so central to the game they can't really be removed or significantly altered, so instead of developing missions further when they already dislike the dynamic they've somewhat caused in the game, they have and will seek to do other things to draw away from missions (like wormholes and incursions)."

5/6/2011,"1) eliminating the tier system does not mean that all ships have to have the same stats. ships can have different stats based on role.3) i left off rails because i have no idea what to do with them. frankly, i think the problem with them might be more about the nature of combat in the current game than rails themselves. they are the long range, low alpha weapon in the age of medium range, high-alpha engagements. they need some love, but i can't really be arsed to think about the balance of a weapon system i'll never use.4) there's more than one way to skin this cat, but your proposed changes are an enormous buff just to overcome the incompatibility between armor buffer tanking and the need for agility. also, no t1 ships can have both an armor bonus and an agility bonus without compromising dps, so changing multiple bonuses to fix the problem is only going to work for t2 ships, if at all.5) regarding fitting upgrades, there are actually only a few ships where this is even a problem, the hyperion being the worst. the megathron has good fitting capability for it's role, for example. i'm not suggesting a fitting buff to the whole lineup."

5/6/2011,"on the topic of destroyersdestroyers are nearly as big as cruisers- as such, why don't they tank nearly as good as cruisers? the argument for signature radius has been discussed for quite some time, but it seems kind of silly that a ship as big as a rupture should have a signature the size of a shield tanked rifter.it might be better to increase the destroyer's slots, fitting, and str/arm/sh hp to that of a cruiser class vessel, while continuing to give it bonuses to small class weapons.this would do a number of things (aside from making level 1/2 missions extremely easy) a)it gives the destroyer survivability in fleets b)makes it not only the bane of frigates, but makes it significantly harder for that dramiel to solo killand c)this would increase the usefulness of the destroyer without interfering with larger ship's ability to kill/hit them- thus avoiding low sig thrasher gangs becoming the new anti everything."

5/6/2011,"you know, i'm **** at solo pvp, and i haven't had much success at pvp in eve in general. part of that is for the reasons you listed, but it's also because i don't spend a lot of time pvping.your attitude sucks. pvp in eve has great potential and can be a lot of fun if you do it right. it's not about dropping a massive gate camping and waiting for newbs to fly through, though a lot of people do it that way, and it's not about warping off and logging off, every time you see a force larger than yours.the best fun i've had in pvp has all been in gangs, roaming and skirmishing with next to no kills, and most often no losses. that's fun, and that's pvp how it should be. not great fleet battles where no one knows what they're doing, and everyone fits for max dps and no tank because they know if they're primaried they're done anyway. 0.0 blobbing works this way. crowd-tanking lagfest, and that's about it. i've never done it, but i know the basic theory behind it, and it doesn't impress me.even without lag, it wouldn't be much fun. wait.. i have done it, but only in a mass test on sisi, and it wasn't the least bit fun. i didn't even get shot at, though i did get jammed out a few times by my target. not pvp.lowsec is rediculous, and it's hard to believe bullies in a schoolyard could fly big ships like that. that's all it is really, with the rough equivalent to calling the teachers when they run into trouble, being either petitioning a gm cause someone is spoiling their fun, or using aggression mechanics to dodge the fight. sure it's technical, but not really interesting. also not pvp."
5/6/2011,"x gallentiusyou seem to assume that no one in eve wants small gang pvp. i agree the fact that ccp has never really tried to develop a mechanism to bring it about, surely lead to many people who did want it leaving the game. but i do think there are still many in game who like it, and likely many who would resub/stay subbed if ccp did it right. moreover, eve would keep many of those players who like eve and pvp but arent interested in being bossed around by some mope in null sec, nor do they want to quit their day job to become a null sec alliance leader. really just think about that middle road player and how neglected we are by ccp. ccp gives these options: 1) take orders from people who drop out of real life to play video games, 2) drop out of real life to be an alliance leader yourself, 3) stay in high sec and shoot red xes or 4) this game is not for you.for the guy who likes the game and wants to blow stuff up without having to commit key parts of their life to socializing with internet buds instead of family, real life friends, and associates  well they simply say this game is not for you. so again if eve did something for the middle road player you might see more of them  a lot more of them. more of them means that more fights would constantly happen across the regions and there wouldnt be anywhere for the rabbits to run. now on to the specific points. would rabbits prefer the entire enemy militia be informed when they open a plex or not? you say rabbit alts, but it really doesnt matter whether they are alts or not. there is still a real person flying the ships and trying to accomplish a goal spending real life time. now they can cap plexes without anyone even realizing what they are doing. thats a big reason why rabbits are successful.you keep equating plexing and running missions. and because of the stupid plex npcs you may have good grounds for doing that. under current mechanics need to fight npcs and so plex ships are often set up for pve. that means they are of course going to run from a pvp ship. no one wants to get in a pvp fight in a pve ship. but if you remove the npcs from plexes there is no longer a reason to be pve fit. so why not pvp fit your ship? so you see the rats and the lack of notice *both* create conditions where plexing is best done by rabbits. i go in plexes but i never try to capture a medium plex. the reason i dont is because in general i like buffer tank pvp set ups. if i draw agro from the rats they will eat through 20-40% of my buffer tank. and no i dont want to start pvping with other players with a fraction of my hit points. so the solution is easy. eliminate the rats so people *can* fly pvp ships and cap plexes. you continue to talk about how people do things with the current mechanics and you simply assume that everyone will stop paying attention to the plex notifications because no one will want pvp. i really doubt that is the case. lots of people want pvp its just that it takes too long to find it in the current eve mechanics, so people uninstall. as far as a channel to arrange fights  that has nothing to do with this proposal. you can set up a channel now if you want. rvb does that, if you want that. the original proposal requires no staged/arranged battles between the militias. the original proposal is simply a set of mechanic changes that both militias need to deal with, yet will naturally lead to good small scale pvp fights. requiring artificial agreed duels completely loses the feel of being in a real war. what you propose is more faction war sparring instead of faction war fights. yes sparring is better than warping around for hours with no action at all, but it shouldnt be the vision we are striving for."
5/6/2011,"please refrain from using the term rabbit in an attempt to further your own agenda..it means 'those who run, always'. has nothing to do with plexes not being announced, npcs being there or anything else you might think to use.rabbits are a tool used by isk *****s and 'win at all costs' people just as a scrambler is a tool for the fighter .. they provide massive and easy amounts of standings and/or vp for the useless system occupancy.chase them out of one and they'll open another ad nauseum, no combat has ever or will ever come from them.people will ignore any announcement channel in short order because the last ten or twenty times they were foolish enough to respond to it they drew a rabbit .. has nothing to do with people not wanting pvp, they can quite simply find better 'quality' by doing the same old gate/station/post-dt dance as we all do now.ps: i have not plexed in a pve fit .. ever! if you are unable to do it then the fault is with your fit/paradigm, not the rats ..i have gone into plexes and assassinated whomever was there and got out (and had it done to me) enough times to know that npcs influence combat but are in no way defining it (just be wary of full spawns)."
5/6/2011,what if i'm right? (yoshida gets it)just adjust your proposal so that i don't have to orbit a button 20 minutes to win if 1) nobody shows up and 2) the rabbit bails.
5/6/2011,"the fault is with my fit/paradigm not the rats? is this code for: i need to start fitting fit an active repper to my pvp ships like you do?in other words i cant fly what i think are the best pvp set ups. i have to gimp them a bit to account for the rats. but then when im fighting the rats in an offensive plex with this gimped ship i realize the enemy who comes in wont get attacked. so he does not need to gimp his ship fit *at all.* sorry i and most others are not interested in those fights. that is one reason why almost no one does plexes. you might make up for your subpar fits with numbers. and indeed a repper on certain amarr ships sometimes isnt so bad. but others fly other races. this is a big reason why very few are in fw, and of those very few in fw, almost no one does occupancy plexing. the fact that you do so much occupancy plexing does not prove that your suggestions are more valid than every other player. it may actually show your perspective is somewhat out of touch. very few players are interested in what you find enjoyable. i may be out of touch too. it very well may be that many players do not want allot small gang pvp like im suggesting. i may be the only one. ccp never set up any mechanics that would encourage small gang pvp so we just dont know how popular they would be. but i tend to think there are allot of players would like allot of quality small scale pvp. rabbits do not achieve their goals of standings, isk or wins if they do not finish the plex. so giving the other side a tool that can help them easily prevent enemy rabbits from finishing a plex will deter that conduct. right now the only way to prevent rabbits from achieving their goals is to waste time chasing them around through several jumps. a notification system completely eliminates the need to chase anyone. again you are arguing against common sense. just because common sense is not always common, doesnt mean its not sensible. i already addressed your claim about how rats force people to fly pve fits or at best suboptimal pvp fits. moreover players just dont like starting pvp when they are already under fire from rats. you and ccp can disagree all you want but youre just refusing to open your eyes. this really isnt controversial. im not sure what you love so much about shooting red crosses that you always take such offense at eliminating them from plexxes. but after several months of shooting red xs most players grow bored of it. deny it all you want its still true."
5/6/2011,if you are right we will have the status quo - virtually no one caring about fw plexes. i'm fine with adjusting the proposal if i know what you mean and it makes sense. but i'm not sure what you are suggesting. lets discuss what should happen a pvper (hereinafter referred to as pvper) chases a rabbit ( hereinafter referred to as rabbit) out of a 20 minute plex. the options would seem to be:1) the pvper would have to run the entire 20 minute timer to win the plex2) the pvper would have to run the timer for whatever amount of time the rabbit ran it to win the plex3) the pvper would have to run the timer for some other set amount of time. it would seem that option 2 would be the best for defeating rabbits. lets say a rabbit enters a 20 minute plex and then gets chased out after 2 minutes. well then he really helped the other side by allowing them to win a 20 minute plex in 2 minutes. but there may be problems with that (read alt in opposing militia exploit.) so it would seem option 1 or option 3 would be better. im really am not sure what would be optimal. i am entirely open to suggestions. but this is really something that is beside the point of original proposals in this thread. im happy to add other suggestions to the op if we think them through though. i would encourage people to post any ideas that would deter hide and seek plexing/ rabbits and would lead to more small scale quality pvp.
5/6/2011,"i stopped plexing in earnest ages ago when i went full pew. even with exploration probing and forum whoring while orbiting it gets tedious eventually you still need to run there and chase them out. do you think that they will run on their own just because someone knows where they are? you get to see them run a few minutes earlier than now, but the outcome will not change and neither will their behaviour/viability .. the only way to achieve what you seem to want is to make plexes so rare as to be redundant in the first placesub-optimal for 'normal' pvp for sure, just as a sniper fit is a pretty bad idea for jumping into an enemy. the ""one fit to rule them all"" does not exist, contrary to what fotm junkies may tell you. different circumstances requires different fits and tactics, you should know that."
5/6/2011,"consider how it will work. lets say i have 6 minutes left on a plex i am running. then i see in a system one jump away an enemy plexer starts a 15 minute plex. i wait out my plex and then jump over one system. if he is a rabbit he will run and i will win his plex. he just wasted 6 minutes. all of my time so far has been toward doing plexes. lets say i see that about 15 minutes later he opens another plex. if he opens it 2 or three jumps away i may finish the plex im running and kick him out again. now if he opened it 15 jumps away i will not go chasing after him. if no one in my militia near him is willing to go fight for the plex, we will lose the plex. but i think the chances are pretty good that there may be someone from my militia who can finish up what they are doing (maybe a plex) and within say 1-3 jumps chase the rabbit out of *that* plex too. see the rabbit will then have wasted allot of time whereas we will be spending our time optimally to win plexes. really with only about 8 active plexers you can have the entire fw front covered. rabbits would not be able to plex without having an opposing militia being able to get to them in 3 or fewer jumps. this is why rabbits would not work in this system. as far as pve versus pvp fits yes i agree that you need to fit your ship for what you are doing. popular fits include: 1)sniper fits 2) kiter fits 3) pure in close gank and tank fits etc. each fit has its own strategy.one unpopular fit is: the fit that is intended to have a pvp fight while you are getting pounded by unknown amounts of rat dps and ewar. it just isnt catching on no matter how often ccp tries to tell us pvp and pve would be a fun mix. its not a fun mix. in fact i would even go so far as to say, it sucks. it may be fun some day but for right now very very very few players have any interest in that fit or strategy. so for right now i think they should accept that reality and make game mechanics based on the reality of what players like. later after they make the game fun for how the current players like to play the game they can then start trying to make pve and pvp mix together in some alternative mechanic. but the misguided view, that pve and pvp mix well, has plagued fw plexing for long enough. it has resulted in the majority of people fitting for pve and running from pvp."
5/6/2011,"except that a supercarrier's primary weapon system doesn't require cap, and in the case of the nyx and aeon their ehp buffer doesn't necessarily require it either.all you do with this proposal is bump the neuting caps way up the target priority list from 'free easy killmail' to 'mild irritant' while doing little to rebalance fleet combat and further cementing 'capitals online' by obsoleting one of the few semi-useful roles smaller hulls have remaining against caps."
5/6/2011,"theres a simple way to figure out that super carriers need to be nerfed.erebus potential ehp: 36 mill, max dps: 12k (excluding dd)nyx potential ehp: 36 mill , max dps: 12.5khmmmmmmm"
5/6/2011,"1) lp interface is horribly wrong. you need a lot of scrolling to find anything. just arrange it like market is arranged.2) in eft there is an option, right click on item->choose ""open market group"". very useful. can we have it eve too?3) if you don't look at ship it's impossible to tell where it goes, very annoying. introduce direction vectors (mentioned and tread linked above).4) slider for directional scanner distance setting. very easy to implement, why do we need to manually input range in km? 5) overheating interface is horrible. very hard to aim for little green bar, ctrl+click, alt+click, shift+click, middle mouse button, anything would be better than this.and ****ing font!"
5/6/2011,"how about letting us just customise our own damn ui? conan did it and while the rest of the game sucked, that was a really nice feature to use!"

5/6/2011,"assault frigates... i.e. assault... they should get hit points bonus, so that they can withstand some punishment... they need stronger firepower and much more hitpoints than normal frigates. double assault frigates hit points.assault frigates need to withstand heavy gun fire (which they do with ab) and have room to resist small firearms. assault frigates are meant to be close combat focused, extra toughness and extra armor makes sure that despite smaller guns, they are interesting choice for combat.assault frigates cost much more than a cruiser, they need to be used against larger class enemies, so give them decent armor and shields. also 50% more firepower than tech 1 counterparts and focus on close range combat."
5/6/2011,up! let more people see this!
5/6/2011,"my alliance for a pony.not at all. develop a standardized ruleset for stats and then make each deviation a subset of rules.for example. the battlecruiser class has 9900 hp total. the standard would be 3300/3300/3300 hull/armor/shield. racial flavor would put minmatar at -20% hull and +10% armor/shield. caldari -10% hull/armor and +20% shield. amarr at -10% hull/shield and +20% armor. gallente -20% shield and +10% hull/armor. the cyclone is a shield oriented ship so would get a further +10% to shield and -10% to armor. the hurricane would fit the standard minmatar deviation.each race will have at least one ship at the racial deviation of the standard. then you simply tweak individual ships around that. race neutral ships would be the 'purest'.ccp could pay me $1000 to do it for them. i have half a mind to do it for free anyway.it's only hard if you try to do it without a solid foundation.actually, they force progression. but since progression in eve is entirely based on sp, knowledge, associations, and isk... there is no need for a mundane planned obsolescence of entire lines of ships."

5/6/2011,battleships suffer from tiering too.
5/6/2011,"1. i think perhap's you're going to have to explain this one.2. never seen a jump drive, but i think the idea is that they are supposed to result in ships popping up unexpectedly. j/k :)3. i think a better idea, would be to make the rest of the ships smaller, as they are already scaled to proportions that make them big next to planets, stations, and pos.4. so, only pod's should be self-destructible? something has to be, or people could potentially require gm's interceding on their behalf to get out of wormholes. really, so kill it faster than the self destruct sequence, or lose the kill, i don't particularly care as it's not a real issue.5. yeah, that's kind of stupid, but pirates are monkeys.6. a little extreme, basing rr consequences on security status. there are other ways to do it.7. i use drones, and yet i have no idea what you are talking about. 8. i believe this belongs in the ship balance thread requested by csm, and perhap's could use a little more detail. aside from that, everything else need's to be picked up, where drakes are about where they should be and could even use a little fixing in some areas.9. what? nothing is sticky that i am aware of, though everything has cycles. click it, and it will cycle out and die. anything else is a bug, that you and a select few others may alone be experiencing.10. that's just picky. it's not an fps game, we can't really expect our accuracy to be based on graphics or vice versa. we don't actually do any aiming.11. curious notion; no idea what you are talking about. you seem to have a lot of problems.12. i beleive you need a better computer. i never have a problem with this, and everything saves just fine. problem is likely ram related, and may be the result of memory errors or something. either that, or your character node is stored on a bad server.13. lol.. maybe you can get a friend to bring fuel, and pop it in the bay before the countdown completes :)14. graphics stuff; not sure what the problem is.15. again with the computer stuff.16. vague. are you talking about the blobby white graphical glitch? if so, it doesn't require being far away.17. really picky. i've never taken the time to put a stopwatch on acceleration/deceleration.18. yeah, textures need a refresh. gallente is blobby and grotesque, caldari is grey and splotchy, and amarr is kinda chunky. larger the model, the more the texture is stretched. smaller models mean better looking textures."

5/6/2011,"i suggest a complete redesign of the fof missile guidance system. let's go back to what we really want the thing to do -- target the sources of disruptive ecm and similar effects [warp jamming, webbing, ecm, target painting, weapon jamming, etc.] except those tagged as emitted from your own fleet.in this way, they'd be an especial hazard to ships and drones using those effects on us -- which is what we want. [me? no -- i ""never"" use those effects on anyone, do i fellas?]it's ok with me if they have to be renamed in the process.{i've only been here almost eight years now -- see you in deep space when you least expect company. }"
5/6/2011,"well, i agree with you that a complete overhaul of these sad unloved missiles is probably in order - but given ccp's record on changing things piecemeal as opposed to outright altering things on a vast scale, i think it's probably better to ask for small things first. to be honest i had been looking at the problem from a pve perspective and hadn't considered the pvp aspects, but they are totally valid and add an interestiing dimension, especially when you consider the effects from 'friendly' pilots anyway, don't forget to support even if you don't agree with all of the specific proposals here, but would like to see an overhaul of fof missiles in general."
5/6/2011,"hopeless...fof missiles may have lower precision... much higher costs, shorter range... but they must work.fof missiles could be cool if they stayed on one target, or even fired 3 times more missiles at the expense of longer reload time... 3 missiles volleys, long reload cycle (like arty, 5 volley time)... alpha potentially kills target, all warheads lock the same target at the time of triple launch."
5/6/2011,"so you were only addressing things from the ""the internets told me that xyz is epic fail! lets make them epic win guis!!"" perspective?"
5/6/2011,"no, of course not. it's just that, for me personally, the use of fof missiles in a pvp situation has never occurred.now, do you actually have a point to make or is it back under your bridge for you?"
5/6/2011,you know you want to!this stuff is pretty awesome and while having not yet used up my sixer i allready hunger for more.for added hilarity consider requiring a frozen corpse in the exchange.

5/6/2011,"a time back, i had posted an idea for incorporating ""counter-missions"" and a fusion of pve & pvp. it went as follows:this is an opportunity for ccp to handle some known problems and stale gameplay of missions. there needs to be more ""risk"" involved to get the adrenaline pumping for mission runners. introduce an added player element, like in a sense, ""counter-missions."" let's say a player contacts an agent for a courier mission... boring right? he accepts the mission though cause it's good money. well, what if another player goes to a competing npc corp (or perhaps player corp) agent. this competing agent has gained knowledge on this courier run and implores this player to intercept that courier and to destroy the ship and said contents. hes given a name and a drop off system. voila! instant cat and mouse.the same kind of counter mission could be done for protecting a facility from another players attack even be it in the third room of the attacking players mission. of course time frames for the mission completion would need to be greatly reduced and there would be a need for ship size limitations perhaps. but, you get the idea, bestow a possible chance for ones mission to get counter-missioned!this would increase the need for corp involvement. perhaps there would be a need for a max amount of counter hired missioners... say squad size only... or as rewards get higher, wing and maybe fleet size would be allowed. i would think this could be a fairly easy way to knock out some of the stagnant feel to missions."
5/6/2011,"analogy: wormholer's are kinda like coal miners; they go deep into the pit, and no one ever sees them again.you're right of course, though i'm not surprised you haven't received any replies. the issue is that you are preaching to deaf ears. nobody here gives a damn about you or your wormholes; all they care about is nullsec and pvp. i used to wormhole, and i know exactly how boring it is, and how profitable. unlike most wormholer's, i actually visit these forums, more than just when i want to ask for something. your ideas are relatively sound and i have no issue with most of what you have to say, except that i would skip the need love bit. wormholing is second in profitability only to nullsec moon mining, and it's generally more secure.it's also incredibly painful logistically, (not impossible, just worse than anywhere else), and limited in player interaction. oddly, that last is also a benefit, given some of the player interactions in eve are less than desireable, but then, i've fought nullsec pirates in wormholes before too, so it's not completely inaccessible.1. ice mining sites. good idea, 50/50 with regular grav sites. the only issue, is that of determining what kind of ice to drop in there, and whether ice in wormholes is fair, given there is none in nullsec. i'm not 100% on that last, but i know it's not found in any searches using 3rd party sites dedicated to that sort of thing.2. lesser moon-mining is a bit of a dream for wormholers, and one i'm not certain i share. i did, don't get me wrong, but i also recognize that wormhole profitability is enough, despite that it's so seperated from everything else.3. everybody should have this benefit. bookmarks are annoying, and generally a clunky method of handling what should be a simple data transfer in fleet.4. given that wormholes only have pi and anomolies, something else would be good, though there is currently the constant threat of hostilities from nullsec, lowsec, and neighbour's. bluntly though, despite all that, wormholes are boring places, where nothing happens for hours, days, or even weeks. sometimes anomolies and sites dry up, and the only thing you have to do, is sit in a pos bubble and flip statics.if you can imagine, (non-wormholer's, i'm talking to you), sitting in a pos for 8 days looking at a star shield ripples and effects, and watching the sun burn endlessly, while local sits dry and empty and corp chat sits in endless silence, then you have an idea of what it's like in the depths of unknown space.there are no asteroid belts, ice belts, gates, or anything else. something to alter that might be good, though i find i like it much the way it is, and only wish i could better control entrance and egress from within.but still, it can get tedious, and i understand not everybody likes it as much as i do, and i get tired of sitting there endlessly myself sometimes too. especially if i log in regularly for any length of time, when there really is nothing to do."

5/6/2011,"good point on the rorq, i didn't know that actually. let's keep the proposal strictly to hauling live toons then, not jump clones.i intend also to make these supplemental to courier missions that you can get from the npc corps. for the npc corp hauling, i intended it as a corp that would give 100% hauling missions and have it only haul passengers. these pay more than the standard hauling job because there are potential hazards with failing the haul, as described before.good points on the edge cases. perhaps we can tread logging off as if the hauler is in suspension, in a station. the haul is not failed, but if it is not completed in time, then the haul is failed. if a contract expires or the contract is failed in space, the hauler has the option of completing the haul to the designated destination for the non-bonus standard award, or just jettisoning his passengers or dropping them off at the nearest station for sec status hit.for readers if you support this enough to keep the discussion going, please vote so, thanks!"
5/6/2011,it is also called courier missions.it is insanely good isk compared to risk and you only need to invest like 1 million to get a tech 1 hauler and a shuttle.incidentally you also do carry passengers on those missions.for some odd reason all loot is worthless crap so no pirating there unless you just want to grief **** out of some macros.
5/6/2011,"actually for those last few questions in my previous post, i was thinking of the passengers themselves. if they aren't clones, then they're real players who are essentially in 'stasis' for the duration of the contract. it seems like a really good opportunity for ransoming/griefing/etc. there are a couple of other opportunities for gaming this system as well. though those will depend on collateral. will there be collateral, as in other courier jobs? how do you propose this system handle the player passenger's implants? what happens to the passenger if a contract is failed? what about if the ship is self destructed, as opposed to destroyed by pirates? if the passenger can be ""captured"" by a pirate, what if the pirate opts not to ransom at all but hold onto the person indefinitely? i like the general idea, that is, being able to move players around as passengers, but there are a lot of real difficulties. i imagine from ccp's perspective, the contract system isn't really designed to account for something that isn't an item, esp one that is 'concious' and using the market/mail during transit. coming from the other direction, the rorq has a very similar function through the use of clone vats, perhaps the clones can be more easily classified as objects for the purpose of contract creation. anyway. just a few things to consider. creativity is a good thing."
5/6/2011,"stronly support transportation/trade thing. hauling must become a job, a profession offered by npcs"
5/6/2011,"yep, we definitely need more npc-grinding in our mmo where we could have player interaction instead.not supporting any kind of npc ferrying, being ferried by npcs or any related stuff.but i'd support hauling other player characters or their jumpclones, could be an interesting expansion of the courier-contracts."
5/6/2011,"forgive me if this is already presented (but i searched using this forum search and it didn't come up)but i would like a select all function when choosing items to add to an item exchange contract. it becomes unwieldy to select them one at a time when there are a lot of them to go through. add to that a ""search"" or a ""filter"" items and the dialog will be a lot more useful."

5/6/2011,"low-security space is frequently considered to be a joke. it lacks the safety of high-security space, the profitability of 0.0 space, and is generally regarded as a wasteland dotted by factional warfare gangs, an occasional high-security gate camp, the few brave mission runners, and thousands of cyno alts for 0.0 logistics. low-sec's fallow state amounts to a not-inconsiderable swathe of the new eden map simply going to waste regardless of the infrequent addition of a new feature to the region and despite the potential of low-sec. my interest in invigorating low-sec is rooted in an internet forum argument. the specific details of this argument (like all internet forum arguments) are irrelevant but resulted in my opinion that low-sec and npc 0.0 are the natural home of small gang pvp. npc 0.0 is renowned for the amount and the quality of its small gang combat, while low-sec is not renowned for much of anything. this discrepancy led me to consider ways to make low-sec more attractive for small gangs and groups interested in gaining experience and resources before venturing into 0.0 without inviting the attention and subsequent domination of large 0.0 entities.what is to be done? i believe that low-sec would gain from a system that encourages active residency and semi-permanent settlement by individual corps and new alliances by offering benefits (both financial and quality of life) targeted at individual pilots and their corporations. however these benefits must not be attractive or practical for 0.0 entities to exploit. the system i envision revolves around the now-ubiquitous anchored space widget in the form of the economic blockade unit.the system in action a corporation sets up in a low-sec station system, drops an economic blockade unit, a 250m3 module that costs 50 million isk, anchors and onlines in one minute, and can be killed by 10 guys in cruiser-battlecruiser hulls in 5-10 minutes. this module has no reinforcement timer.the economic blockade unit cannot be targeted by capital/supercapital-class vessels and cannot be hit by fighters. it will rely on high resists to provide its buffer over hit points to facilitate repairs during combat.by deploying the economic blockade unit, the corporation reaps several territory-related benefits, ranging from system-wide to constellation and region-wide. by making benefits related to pvp region-wide it is my hope that corporations would find it easier to launch attacks on their neighbors. by making pve and corporate income benefits constellation and system-based, i would offer a reason to launch attacks on a neighboring corporation in possession of more lucrative territory.the specific benefits of the ebu are as follows:* corporation members do not lose security status killing people in the low-sec portions of that region, and npc sentry guns won't shoot them.* global criminal countdown no longer affects members of that corporation in that constellation. * corporation members receive a 10% bonus to loyalty point rewards from agents in that constellation. * should the corporation hold the system for two hours will cause the system to be identified as the turf of this corporation/alliance.* should the corporation hold the system for four hours any billboards will be defaced with the corporation logo.* the corporation itself receives a financial incentive each hour the economic blockade unit is online. the value of this financial incentive is directly linked to the number of stations within the system, with a system of diminishing returns amounting to a 100%-75%-50%-10% base value depreciation per station.* holding additional station systems within that constellation runs into a further diminishing returns equal to 66% of the base station value.* any ebus anchored outside of the constellation results in returns of 30% of the base station value."
5/6/2011,"i believe this change would facilitate fast-paced, small gang combat with frequent territorial gains and losses, leading to a fluid and dynamic low-sec. corps and alliances capable of more or less maintaining their grip on a given territory become regional or constellation powers. my goal is to create the eve online equivalent of somali warlords, armed with ak-47s and rpgs and packed into pickup trucks, which 0.0 powers nevertheless have to deal with because these gang chieftains are sitting on their logistics lifelines to empire. whether 0.0 powers attempt to turn these residents into allies, enemies, or privateers turned loose on their rivals, they have an opportunity to partake in 0.0's great game of war, diplomacy, and bribery on their own terms.the vulnerability of the economic blockade unit essentially demands residency in order to protect the module and the benefits it provides. however, the fragility of holding this low-sec turf is matched by the low impact of its loss: losing control of your station system costs your corporation roughly 50 million isk. this is a deliberate break with the high stakes of the existing 0.0 sovereignty widget system. in 0.0, some alliances recover from the loss of their space. most do not. the savage consequences of territorial loss in 0.0 leads to a very conservative approach to the game designed to minimize the chance that trillions of isk worth of assets are destroyed or permanently locked away beyond reach. a low-sec corporation that loses its system in the night could come and take it right back tomorrow. the ephemeral nature of the ebu implies that the hourly financial incentive provided the anchoring corporation should be a significant percentage of the value of the module. i had spent a great deal of time wrestling with the amount and nature of the financial incentive before i came to the conclusion that it was a detail that could only be addressed by ccp, since ccp obviously has a much better idea of what they want the economy to look like than i do. that said, there are certain practicalities that must be kept in mind when creating low-sec financial incentives.while i understand that ccp is likely to make the financial incentive a new gimmick material or item, this would link the success of low-sec to the success of the gimmick. for example, i am a shareholder in the only publicly offered revenant supercarrier bpc, an item only available as a rare drop from low-sec incursions. as of this writing we have not been able to turn a profit from this rare, low-sec-only gimmick-commodity because the gimmick-ship is junk. as such, i would prefer the reward not to be a new and unproven gimmick.the purpose of the financial incentive is to offer new corporations and alliances a source of corporation or alliance-level income independent of taxes (as ebu benefits revolve around encouraging mission running among the membership and the real value of missions is in untaxable loyalty points) with which to fund corporation or alliance programs.in 0.0 space this is frequently the province of rental fees or r64/technetium moon mining, but valuable moons in low-sec are almost always owned by 0.0 alliances and for all practical purposes untouchable.there is a fine line to be walked between providing a financial incentive for a corporation to get involved in low-sec territorial skirmishes and making it so lucrative that a corporation has no impetus to move on to bigger things like 0.0 space. while it is possible that a corporation could decide that it is happy with a permanent low-sec existence, the trade-off should be a fixed income and less opportunity for growth."
5/6/2011,"one of the recurring themes in the 2011 fanfest discussions was the attempt to break the tyranny of n +1. that is to say, the natural trend in which more numbers becomes the ultimate method of winning fights, breaking deadlocks, and brute-forcing through any opposition. to an extent it is a struggle against basic human nature. my attempt to outflank n+1 is to pit other aspects of basic human nature (greed and sloth) against this tendency to huddle together in ever-larger social units.questions & answersby removing global criminal countdowns and gate guns from the equation you are removing the very essence of low-sec!that is one interpretation, but i would counter that these specific low-sec mechanics are unpopular and do nothing to make the space any safer than 0.0 anyway.as it stands right now, npc sentry guns will not save you from low-sec pirates, because low-sec pirates have the option to fly ships that can tank sentry guns. global criminal countdown does nothing to prevent the destruction of, or to avenge, your ship. it simply amounts to fifteen minutes that the pirates have to spend waiting before they can enter high-sec.during my low-sec incursion expeditions, we would occasionally find ourselves in positions to engage in pvp. at no point did gate guns or gccs prevent us from blowing up other ships, though i would almost have preferred not to because of the whining and subsequent boredom as we waited out our timers. if the essence of low-sec is ineffectual mechanics that only serve to make pvp tedious, well, i would posit that this is an essence we can do without.isn't there a massive control and territorial exchange system in place with faction warfare?yes, but this is not factional warfare. this is space-gangs fighting over who runs this space-block regardless of the technical sovereignty of the system. factional warfare corporations would not be able to drop ebus or to reap the benefits so long as they are a member of the militia.i hate magical space modules! come up with a better system!i can't. however, as a man who has shot many an enormous immobile space structure, i believe that the magical space widget system can be finessed. instead of shooting ihubs with 200 of your closest friends for a few hours a couple times a week, this widget is designed to be both easily assailable (by a small sub-battleship gang in under ten minutes) and easily defensible (by utilizing high resists over sheer hitpoints.)also you only shoot it once.what keeps 0.0 powers from monopolizing this like they do other low-sec resources like valuable moons and low-sec incursions?0.0 powers monopolize low-sec moons because low-sec moons do not require them to actively defend the moon around the clock. reinforcement mechanics allow for 0.0 powers to call defense ops well in advance and to titanbridge enough guys into the system that the only other powers capable of matching them in numbers are other 0.0 powers.the 0.0 power monopoly on low-sec incursions comes about through two factors: the temporary nature of incursions, and the same qualities of communication, organization, and scale that allow a 0.0 power to to rally its membership to fight 0.0 wars can be utilized to organize fifty guys to do what amounts to a personally lucrative three day deployment/safari to low-sec. the fact that it is a temporary, short-term deployment means that it is not an inconvenience for a member of a 0.0 alliance to clonejump down for a few days and the availability of cheap and quick freighter services in empire means that it is fully possible to simply leave your incursion-running ships in empire and have them couriered to wherever a new low-sec incursion spawns within hours.without reinforcement timers, a 0.0 power would have to have a significant number of its members active in a specific low-sec constellation instead of in its own home regions, indefinitely. this is improbable."
5/6/2011,"your plan specifically states a lp % increase but there are lots of low-sec stations without l4 agents!sounds like low-sec could use more l4 agents then. that said, ccp is interested in making space worth fighting over through scarcity. i expect low-sec systems to be valued on a mix of location (popular entrances to high-sec, for example), number of stations, and the availability or quality of the agents. some constellations will be less valuable than others, some will be furiously fought over. a new corporation could use an otherwise poor system as their very first base from which they would attack more valuable systems.this is nothing but a space-pirate fantasy!the mechanics can be utilized by any number of different corporation types. the same mechanics used by a space-pirate corporation to make their constellation a dangerous hive of scum and villainy could be used by an nrds anti-pirate entity to turn their constellation into an extension of empire. the mechanics are neutral, the only question is how the player corporations choose to use them.why does your system revolve around stations?because stations are where the people are. non-station systems are places you rat, or mine, or pass through. nobody cares about them. stations are where people live, where you keep your stuff. stations matter."
5/6/2011,i strongly endorse this proposal. this is what i meant when i said that the game lacks goals for smaller groups and this would introduce a reason to go to lowsec aside from the desire to get to the other side.
5/6/2011,"incredibly long post is incredibly long......but very interesting and well thought out.you did hit a good point of ensuring the lowsec is not as profitable as nullsec. this maintains a system of 'escalation' for players in which risk to reward ever increases.the idea is sound, but needs some more fleshing out...something ccp would need to do of course. i'd like to see more csm comments, regardless of support, on whether this is in the right direction for pumping up lowsec. system-based, this makes it easier for pirate to locate players running missions...or just pvp in general to happen.the change in gcc could be rocky, but i think that is an excellent method for getting pvp only gangs involved. even they get an incentive for taking a system/constellation and hunting there.one point of clarification...would the ebu be easily found? does it show on the overview much like a cyno? if it has to be scanned down, how does a player know the system he has entered has an active ebu? remember, your mechanics don't show sov of any sort immediately."
5/6/2011,"i've given this some thought and my initial reaction was to have it anchored like 50-70km off a station. i'm not necessarily sure this is a good idea due to the potential for docking games. generally speaking stations are the most logical place to hang an ebu but if the complication of station games makes that problematic there should be no problem putting it at a planet or even the sun. i wasn't planning on putting it on overview because it would be linked to a specific type of celestial anyway, unlike tcus which can technically be anchored anywhere. ihubs aren't on overview but they aren't that difficult to find because you just warp to planets until you see it."
5/6/2011,"it's an interesting idea but i see some problems with it. let's say i throw up one of these things in my home system and am able to defend it, my neighbors (whom i hate) 1 jump away also throw one up and defend it. do both groups get the full benefits? what if two different groups put them in the same system? is that even allowed? if so then there isn't much sense in attacking the other guy's thingy unless i just feel like messing with them. the other problem is this does nothing to address the n+1 issue. you've stated 10 guys in bc's should be able to kill it in 10 minutes but nothing is stopping anyone from bringing 100.my own view is that low sec is working as intended. the low sec systems with decent quality agents are populated and the agents heavily used. the people who use them drive out neutrals for obvious reasons but when local is blue, they are missioning typically. so mechanic wise, i don't see any need for a change in how low sec works. reworking the way mission rewards are handled so 0.1 sec payout and 0.4 sec payout are the same would be good. expanding the number of good quality agents in low sec would also be great since most systems (the ones with no one in them) contain no agents or other resources of value."
5/6/2011,in short:eve version of capture/hold the flag...and the concept is even 1:1 reusable for fw+1
5/6/2011,good thing you are not alone. read it and weep!no static ehp crap to shoot. no direct null influence. player based security.no more soup brewed on old bones.

5/6/2011,"short response:i dislike this proposal for two reasons. first, it's very much an attempt to do game design rather than highlighting an issue; isn't that supposed to be a big no-no with csm proposals? second, i don't agree with your assessment of the current state of lowsec (in terms of population and activity) or with the implicit goals and attitudes behind your proposal.long-ass response with numbers and stuff:according to the q3 2010 qen, 29% of all kills occur in lowsec, compared to 16% in high, 51% in null (sov and npc), and 4% in w-space. however, in terms of total system count, lowsec is by far the smallest of those four sectors of space, accounting for 8.6% of all systems to highsec's 15.3%, nullsec's 44.6%, and w-space's 31.5%. that is to say, on a per-system basis, lowsec sees more pvp than any other sector of space in the game. the assertion that lowsec is somehow underpopulated or a ""wasteland"" is also hard to reconcile with the data ccp have put out: per the q2 2010 qen, 8% of all active and logged-in characters are in lowsec; this compares to 53% in highsec, 32% in sov/npc 0.0, and 7% in w-space. once you normalise for the number of systems in each sector, it turns out that lowsec is significantly more densely-populated than nullsec and (unsurprisingly) massively more so than w-space. so while it may be your experience that lowsec is a ""wasteland"" that is ""not renowned for much of anything"", it's rather hard to square that experience with the data. it's also completely contradictory to my own experience of living here.second, your comments about having the organizational capacity to bring 50 dudes to run incursions and giving people ""an opportunity to partake in 0.0's great game of war, diplomacy, and bribery"" overlook the fact that lowsec already has a fairly large and healthy community of people who have voted with their feet and said ""no thanks"" to all of those things. lowsec isn't nullsec with training wheels and i don't think it would particularly benefit from mechanics that are, judging by the tone of your post, designed in part to make it that.finally, re: ""the tyranny of n+1"", i'd actually say that the current mechanics of lowsec are about as good a way of countering that as is possible without introducing arbitrary restrictions on the number of people who can participate. the only reason to be in a lowsec-based corp atm is to get fights. however, there are few ways of forcing people to fight in lowsec - no bubbles, no valuable moons or stations or w/e to defend - so if you want to roam and get fights, you have to fly in gangs that people think they can kill and will engage voluntarily. if you roam around with gigantic gangs that none of the locals feel able to engage, you're going to get pretty bored pretty fast because people will see you coming and go elsewhere or just dock up. result: you get bored and have a strong incentive to reduce your gang size or move out to a different sector of space. it's not perfect, and it's certainly not the case that there's no blobbing and ganking in lowsec, but it's about as good as i think it can realistically be."
5/6/2011,only if it also applies to npc stations.
5/6/2011,"around 11% of characters are in the null sec end game.unfortunately because it is impossible to support a null sec existence from null sec resources, so every null sec needs between 2 and about 8 empire alts to support their main.so considerably more than 11% of players operate in the null sec end game."
5/6/2011,"heres what you do. find a region of space everyone wants. capture it. have a huuuuge amount of isk, and put a gallente administrative outpost in every system possible. yay beuracracy."
5/6/2011,no more stations.station spam ruin game.
5/6/2011,"a station in every system, a supercarrier in every belt."
5/6/2011,"we are getting there!-i would support a way to destroy player stations and thus make them crap out all the loot the guys you just evicted couldn't evac. any players who are docked in the station/offline/unsubscribed would ""emergency warp out"" in their active ship.offline and unsubscribed players would of course not show up in the system till they log in, making them appear in their active ship."
5/6/2011,"alliance spam ruins the game, stations are but a symptom of that. really, you guys only do it to yourself, but yeah, i think they should be fully destructible, and ejecting logged pilots into the reaches of space on destruction is a good idea. i don't care for you to get the loot though, and generally think the station should incinerate everything aboard, in the process of its own destruction."
5/6/2011,"this is an urgent matter, 20-30 stations are built every month. it is unbelievable!!! some regions are already completely ruined, but others are ok still.stop station spam now before it is too late!!!destructible stations is ok as well."
5/6/2011,your proposal only cements the gap betwen the haves and the have nots.
5/6/2011,except most of the haves would never build a station.
5/6/2011,"and with an okay region you mean a region that is pretty much a wasteland only inhabited by bots that dont need a station?remove station restrictions, a supercarrier in every belt, a pos on every moon, a station on every planet.edit: also please several station on a planet with less stringent position requirements, so we can make station conga line."
5/6/2011,get teh farmers out of my prairie
5/6/2011,"very simple proposal, and because of its simplicity, its just purely work on ccp with the upside only being much improved looking battles. (yep just eye candy, but who doesn't like eye candy?)make turret misses actually look like misses. currently turret hits on your ship look like hits even when they miss and do no damage. this results in fleet battles where shots look like vertices of a graph, instead of the chaotic lancing that lasers and hybrids should make as they both miss and find their targets. it would also possibly give some sort of innate feel for the turret tracking ability of your guns, when you are watching a target as it is under fire from your guns."
5/6/2011,"that's actually ""in progress"""
5/6/2011,"erm...you vote for csm with your best selfish needs. in fact, you should vote for anything with your own selfish needs. in case you have not realized yet, people are selfish. you should find someone whose ideas you agree with and vote for him, because he is the one most likely to make things change in the direction that you would like them to change."

5/7/2011,"there is little that can be done to make cruisers competitive against battlecruisers. the tier 2's are miles ahead of everything else, they fit more weaponry and have the modules to fit a decent tank.cruisers can't fit as many weapons as battlecruisers to begin with, and they can't boost the weapons they can fit and carry a decent tank. since battlecruisers don't take much more in the way of skills, it really just comes down to people being willing to pay five-ten times more for a hull that's more effective. the only t1 cruisers that actually serve a purpose in fleet fights are blackbirds."
5/7/2011,"quoted for infinite truth.especially when the fixes for a lot of them are so pathetically simple* i have to wonder exactly how ccp's dev team structure works (or doesn't) when it comes to ship balance.it took them what, two years to buff rockets? i forgot exactly how many pages that thread reached but it went on far longer than it should've.*seriously, see my earlier post. for a lot of tech 1 ships it's just a matter of adding some more fitting and a slot or two."
5/7/2011,"tier 2 bcs need to be nerfed to tier 1 levels. cut their ehp, fittings and slots. tier 2 bcs simultaneously step on the toes of cruisers, bs and close-range hacs too much - they're too flexible, too good at too many things, and obsolete too many other ships, not least of all the tier 1 bcs."
5/7/2011,"dude what ever you are smoking, can i have some?also bc > cruisers so of course they are going to step on their toes.next, a good hac pilot who knows what they are doing will have no problem taking down a bcthird, a good bs pilot can take down bc's easily too assuming the pilot is compitent.there is nothing wrong with bc. in the 4 years the tier 2 have been around nothing has needed tweaking, they are very balanced."
5/7/2011,"you fly the prophecy and ferox a lot do you? how about the not quite so useless brutix or crystal loving cyclone?gypsio may be shooting sparrows with cannons, but he sort of has a point.would personally take a bit off the tier2 and add a little to tier1 to close the chasm between them and give a little more breathing room for tier1 bs."
5/7/2011,mechanics changes have been removed.this is now pure visuals.
5/7/2011,"how about something along the lines of charging the warp core into a punch replacing the speed up and slow smooth shift to warp, you would still have to align and it would take the same amount of time, except instead of your ship speeding up slightly maybe its thrusters could go brighter and brighter until it hits the punching point and you warp. this would both make it clearer when people are trying to warp, make it look awesome and still keep the same mechanics of the game. if anything, punch makes it better because the warping ship will be target-able until the punch (it's really annoying trying to lock someone when they're trying to warp, sometimes they don't appear to be warping and you can't lock them). it could also open up space for new modules like warp charge accelerators or warp core power boosters with a charge system."
5/7/2011,"yes, i support this awesome suggestion."
5/7/2011,there's an excellent post on another eve forum (its the one that begins with k and ends with ugutsumen) that i'm just going to quote here:
5/7/2011,"in a word: icons.if there is any (and i mean any) situation where a word can be replaced by a tiny little image, do it. graphical readouts beat text readouts almost unconditionally, if only because they're more compact. icons for ship class, speed, direction, whatever. words bad. pictures good."
5/7/2011,"changing ui's is very tricky for a number of factors involved - user acceptance, ""intuitiveness"" and so on. what one person sees as great, others find completely frustrating to work with and counter-intuitive.as such, i'll suggest far less in the way of ""exacting"" changes and far more in an overall vision of how to approach the design. options - not ""here you go"" should be the core theme of the changes.look at a modular approach to the ui via ""launch pads"" and ""dockable toolbars"".for an idea of what i mean - look at some of wow's old modules - the flexibility of layout and look based upon the user's personal preferences but 100% optional on what you choose to turn on and not turn on.someone wants to set 3 ""shaded"" bars floating in the middle of their screen - top, left and right - fine. whatever but it should be optional and modular enough to allow the user to lay out as they want.to put it another way ""well it's liable to be very complex"" - eve is complex. people don't play the game for it's simplicity. if it's tricky to layout how someone wants everything - that is better than if they can't adjust it and they'll learn how to do it if it gets them the look and feel they want.just allow for export and import of layouts and someone, somewhere, will build a sit of ""presets"" that folks can download from. trust the community to come up with this *if* it is made possible."

5/7/2011,"1. okay, i've never seen that one. would assume it has to do with lag, or is related to it in some way, resulting from server-client communication2. nice. i can see why you miss it. assume it was dropped as part of the lag battle.3. actually, resizing ships is simply a matter of scaling the model, as all the textures are formatted to the model surface, so it doesn't mess it up. i suppose that may be dependent on the 3d program as some are primitive, but i'm fairly certain ccp's isn't. either way, the texture wrap only takes about an hour per ship, and the scaling is maybe 5 minutes, using a model temporarily imported for scaling purposes.4.that actually makes the most sense. 10 minutes for a supercap or titan would be good, and 15-20 minutes for a station. just thought i'd get that int there. 5. heh :)6. well, i'm saying that a person who has -5 or lower security status always has it, so that's not really reasonable to base gcc on. not that it really matters, at least not to me.7. well, thankfully i haven't used drones in awhile :)8. yep9. again, i'm going to assume this is server-client communication error resulting from lag.10. i assume you mean attention to detail is good. it's true, and it wouldn't hurt.11. yes12. ah, i see.13. yep14. see response in 2.15. i never used drones that much.16. i will.17. i like that it decelerates and speeds up, but it could use less time on both. this would make max. warp velocity mean a lot more.18."

(94,6 au/3,75au = 25,2 seconds yet it takes 2,3 times as much time) it makes no sence my proposal is to reduce warp time so people can move faster from point a to point b."
5/7/2011,so you want to make eve even smaller?not supported.
5/7/2011,"yes for making the acceleration and deacceleration scale with max warp speed, to actually introduce a real difference due to ship warp speeds. then decrease bs warp speed a bit, and some ships are faster, some slower, but at least warp speed is relevant (possibly warp speed of for example cov ops needs to be decreased to keep travel speeds a bit realistic, but it should matter, and not it pretty much doesnt unless you warp 100 au)."
5/7/2011,"i actually believe the complete oposite.warping time should be at least 4x longer in my oppinion.it would make eve more tactical and fun in nullsec. maybe autopiloting distance could be halfed to correspond to this.that way frieighters and carebears cant complain.you look at the solar system today and it's huge and is still small compared to others we've observed.dispite eve being in the future, there will never be a technology that can bring an object to 6 au/s in 11 seconds.0.5 au should be the standard."

5/7/2011,"the assumption being i know a guy from a top scoring hulkageddon corp, and they happen to indeed be a highsec griefer corp? he's not even a red aside from hulkageddon time.you realize this is in direct opposition to your first statement, right? but that's okay because you don't really make any sense.i never said it wasn't, so what are you even talking about? this is another one of those occurences of you not making sense. perhaps you don't know what a highsec griefer corp is despite me spelling it out for you, you're very confused, or filled with senseless emorage.after contridicting yourself, flying into random tangents, and apparently still not understanding things as simple as highsec griefer corps which really do contribute the most to hulkageddon despite having this already explained to you, this is pretty amusing."
5/7/2011,"so these griefer corps in high sec, who are blue most of the time and red during hulk, do they use the same toons before and during hulk? and just build back up their standings after hulk ends? i really don't know any examples, so i'm asking."
5/7/2011,"translation: no actual proof, just claiming to ""know"" 1 guy...try and keep up plz 'cause we weren't debating it until u decided to make that baseless assumption with no actual proof.news flash: u haven't ""spelled out"" anything that i haven't already addressed, especially the ""highsec griefing"" part. so u're now saying that high sec and low sec pvp is both griefing? senseless, check. emorage, check.claiming to ""know"" 1 person does not qualify as proof. speaking of tangents, u're the one who, once again, made that baseless assumption with that sorry excuse of what u call ""proof"". plz try again."

5/7/2011,mission variety could be greatly increased just by varying the types of rats spawned within them so that a mission runner didn't know exactly what he would be facing before he warped in.
5/7/2011,"add to that making the triggers in waved missions random, removing the tip to tell you what faction you're fighting before accepting the mission, and adding sleeper ai to the rats."
5/7/2011,"support this +1made similar post a few weeks back. 1. a random drop of ice here and there would be nice.. could be mixed types or one at a time. have no issue working to sustain self in wh space. 2. yes please. mechanics to mine moons is already in the game we pay to play like everyone else in eve. let us mine the moons.. even if the goo is not for t2 production. 3. would be very nice, for now whoever scans makes bm copies and drops em in a designated slot in a corp hanger for all to have access. 4. don't think we need sansha's in there but, some other things would be nice. i see lots of posts about wh's being easy isk, and isk for no work, or isk at no risk. don't mind these ppl. anyone that has lived wh space knows how risky, and what a logistic nightmare wh life is. get it straight flamers, and those that are upset about true sec changes... wh life is not easy money. no intel chans, shifting wh exits, new wh's that spawn 15 min after you complete a scan. no auto local,(some one must type in local to show up) so yes give us wh dwellers some love."
5/7/2011,"i agree. we need bookmark upgrades, we could use some new usage for moons (solo mining of some sort of new materials needed for new wh content), we could use ice gravi sites."
5/7/2011,"by this logic, because you pay to play, you should also be allowed to have a supercapital in there too?face it, there are limitations to every area of space. one of wh space limitations is no moon mining. and the fact that you don't even want it for t2 shows you just want it for the sake of having it. you don't see the fail logic in that?"
5/7/2011,"because you are to short sighted to see the logic is of no concern to me. i make the suggestion to moon mine, that is all. i leave it to ccp to decide what the goo would be used for. we already have cap ships in our wh. and if the corp decides to lay out the isk, and time to mine the mins to build a super cap in a wh.. that should be their choice and investment into holding the wh they live in. wh space has no concord or any other type of ""law"", so in my opinion we should be able to do what we wish in wh space."

5/7/2011,"difficulties aside, i like the ideatho, tbh, it'd prolly be best to restrict the ferrying of pcs to just jumpclones... as said previously, they can be classified as 'items' for the duration of the contract. additionally, they become (of course) unavailable to the contracting-pc until delivered, and there's no worries about dealing with 'concious' pcs who're 'in transit.'+1"
5/7/2011,"ah, i see.well my current thinking that i touched on briefly somewhere earlier in the thread, was that the 'traveling' player will only have access to something like a modified station interface. with access to neocom, and markets and mail and such. this is assuming the haul is going as planned. if the haul is hijacked and the player is kidnapped, he is stuck here until the pirate releases them, or kills them they have to be able to pay the ransom aferall (access to wallet). they have the option of killing themselves if they like (avoids any problems with pirates who can hold players indefinitely in limbo.) they obviously lose all implants if they die. with upcoming incarna designs, something like this 'in transit' interface may be fleshed out even more, with characters being trapped on a pirate cell, unable to leave, etc etc. but i'll leave the future possibilities that incarna brings alone for now.yes, there will certainly be collateral demanded. and along with that protection, you can also specify a quality of the hauler that is allowed to take your contract. (so its not just money alone that determines who can take you) for instance, you may just want to go through empspace, and you don't want to attract attention to yourself by posting a high collateral, so you post small collateral, but only haulers with 98% or higher successful delivery rate. (remember all haulers' hauling records are to be kept and are public, if they are to retain their license to ferry). this incentivizes haulers to strive to keep high success rates and spotless records.on the topic of where the passengers go if a haul is aborted, if not picked up by the pirates that destroyed the hauler, then when their 'can' is collected by the system dt (or maybe after x hours?), then they can be dropped off at the closest station. (in storyline, say by interbus emergency rescue services). if the hauler logs off with haul, nothing should happen until the haul timer is expired. once that happens they appear in the closest station, and the hauler is charged with a failed haul. same goes for self destruction of the hauler. except the haul timer ends immediately.during the trip while the passenger is in the 'in transit' gui they still have access to all neocom, they just have no mobility. they can kill themselves if they wish (say to self abort the trip), but doing so forfeits the reward to the hauler. after the login screen they go straight to the 'in transit' gui."
5/7/2011,"hello tsubutai, if it is all the same to you i'd like to address your points individually.don't care! i'm aware of ccp's views towards amateurish game design (they don't like the competition! haha just a lil joke there ccp) but i was asked to present my idea and i did so. let's move on to number two.my experience in low sec consists of the aforementioned incursions and running reaction and production towers in amarr low sec. the area i was was populated by five or six russian mission runners and it was so quiet that i was jumping unscouted t1 industrials through low sec several times a week for about a year without ever taking a loss or even seeing a gatecamp so my experience doesn't match yours. that's how individual experience works. perhaps the difference between my experience and yours is that i wasn't living in the big flashpoints like tama or rancer?well, one might say that low sec isn't much of anything hence my idea to add a ~sandbox toolset~ to allow corps to make whatever they want out of it. the beautiful thing here is that you have the option to continue your existence without participating if you do not want to. my goal is to offer up additional choices and playstyles to people who are daunted by the investment in 0.0 but want to make an impact. your argument here seems to be that lowsec is the perfect thunderdome because it is worthless so the only people who go there are looking for fights and as such that it is okay for there to be worthless space. ccp has made the argument that they want some space to be more desirable than others (hence the anomaly nerf in 0.0) but they explicitly put in resources to make low sec more attractive (l5 missions, incursions, fw, etc) this says to me that they want low sec to have value and be worth investing in. as of yet they have not been able to strike a balance to encourage lowsec investment by the general playerbase without getting smothered by 0.0 powers, hence my suggestion. it is a simple system but i am a simple smirks.yours in christ,h. ratli smirks."
5/7/2011,"oh man, section-by-section answers and ""yours in christ""? i am being trolled. i get that individual experience will vary, which is why i provided all them numbers regarding the overall population and activity of lowsec to back up my point. you're right that much of amarr lowsec is super-quiet, but that's not the case for lowsec as a whole. i actually don't know *why* places like aridia and khanid lowsec are as quiet as they are (if i had to guess, it'd be something to do with the poor access to trade hubs and the attendant massive pita of doing logistics), but there's a pretty wild difference between those places and, say, molden heath or essence. that said, i don't see the heterogeneity of lowsec as being intrinsically bad. if nothing else, a trip to the backwaters of amarr lowsec allows you to farm 6/10s in peace and quiet. :valso, i don't think that it makes any kind of sense to describe space that is used and enjoyed by a fairly large number of people on a daily basis as ""worthless,"" which i guess is the root of our disagreement."
5/7/2011,"i must have done that in the wrong amarr place then, i have done low sec exploration in amarr space for months, resulting in a total of one 6/10, which was bugged. anyway regarding the proposal, i think it just ends up as a module you ninja-anchor in a quiet low sec system and hope no one notices for a long period, especially when it isnt on overview and can be anchored at the sun. you dont want it to have too much hp, but i also dont believe it will promote small gang combat in any way when you make a mechanic that is less tedious when instead of your 10 cruisers you just get 20 rr bs and take it down in a minute, before any kind of response can be formed. wouldnt it make much more to do something reinforcement timer related, but then not one of hours/days but one measuring in the minutes? then also make it so that lets say the last 2 hours worth of income is in the module itself (so also 2 hours delay on payout), and if you take it down you get it. then you actually got a reason to take them down besides lulz (which means taking a rr bs gang with you, since lulz end pretty fast after shooting structures), and you got a reason to stick with a small gang (more isk/person).that said, even then i have strong doubts about it, and if the goal is to populate low sec with people who actually live there i would do exactly the opposite, not removing sentries (with a module), but massively buffing them (although still making sure you can travel with gcc, and stop resetting it by sentry fire). so effectively removing gatecamping from low sec. that makes low sec unique, and while usually the opposite of what pirate demand (easier to kill targets since it is so hard for them), i truly believe that will result in alot more kills for them, simply because there will be way more people in low sec. meanwhile one of the prime usages of this module will simply be to make sure pirates camping a high sec gate can employ interceptors to catch even more ships in their camps, which will do nothing but decrease the number of people in low sec."
5/7/2011,"lowsec is a 'wasteland' because while a lot of kills may happen there, relatively few people actually live out there on a day-to-day basis. lowsec has become a place that people enter, roam around or camp a gate for a while, get a few killmails or lossmails, and leave again, and even those -10.0 lowsec pirate groups often rely on a network of highsec alts to actually sustain their day to day activities.the benefit of a proposal along these lines (without getting too specific on the individual mechanics discussed) is that it encourages the development of lowsec as an actual place where people might want to go and spend a majority of their time, rather than some kind of 'pvp arena' that outsiders enter on safari trips."
5/7/2011,"again, this doesn't ring true with my experience, although this time i can't cite a bunch of numbers to assess the state of things in lowsec as a whole. however, just looking at the membership numbers of corps who live in my own neck of the woods, you've got us in hevrice (80-ish dudes, although some of us are running around molden heath atm), invicta's 200 guys 4 jumps away in murethand with their supers and l5s and whatnot, spiritus draconis and the former rough necks two jumps in the other direction in aeschee (maybe another 150-200 characters all told?) plus various smaller groups (lucifer's hammer, ministry of destruction and a few others) in the aeschee-lisbaetanne-adirain area, then the gallente fw guys (qcats and percussive diplomacy, 150-ish characters combined) who live 5 jumps away in heydieles. so just looking at the larger corps around here, you've got upwards of 600 characters living within a 9 jump range, and that's not counting the various smaller groups that live here plus the roamers and daytrippers. i'm not sure how that compares to the density of permanent residents in deklein, but at first glance (2700-ish in goonwaffe, 68 systems), it certainly seems to be at least broadly comparable.edit: you're right that most lowsec residents need at least one hauling alt, especially if they're outlaws, but how is that different from the situation in nullsec, where you're heavily reliant on imports from jita? inasmuch as there is a problem with overreliance on highsec for materiel and suchlike, it's a problem that affects the game as a whole rather than being a lowsec-specific issue. basically, there is at present no reason whatsoever for me to set up production facilities in low/nullsec if i can do the same thing with less tiresome hauling and greatly reduced risk in highsec."
5/7/2011,remove low sec entirely. it would make more sense from an rp perspective
5/7/2011,"like the mining drones i would think a salvage drone would be useful when you rather fit a weapon more than a salvager while you are missioning or mine in a barge in an asteroid belt.i think for new players that could be real helpful when they are missioning and don`t have an extra ""looting-ship"" to get the most out of the wrecks.and to use said drone you could create a new skill. ""disassemble drone"" for example.i<U+FFFD>m interested to read what the community thinks to that idea.greets"

5/7/2011,"i think it's time that empire is divided into city-states run by real players. these players, elected for a four-month period, would be in charge of setting a regional tax rate. locals who claim to live in a region (by checking a box or making a selection once per year) could become ""citizens"" within a region and be tax-exempt.mayors would get a percentage of taxes remitted for their efforts at maintaining a region, while having the ability to buy different kinds of upgrades. what specifics? i can't say - i'll leave those up to the emergent community of eve. but one idea might be to install more short range stargates at the expense of few longer range gates.i love this idea because it enables otherwise unaligned players an opportunity to learn some of the diplomatic ins-and-outs of eve and perhaps develop new leaders in the game. it might also have a soft impact on faction warfare or incursions/plexes. any thoughts?"
5/7/2011,do you have any reasons for that? or are we just supposed to accept this assumption?
5/7/2011,"sure i've got reasons. first, as stated in the op, it would create a new dynamic that would introduce players to diplomatic channels and to interest them in taking a part in world shaping.but beyond that, eve online is an emergent game, where players increasing take a role in shaping the universe. it's up to ccp to make certain kinds of tools available to the player community to deepen and widen the scope that the players can participate. but of all the areas of the game that have room for expansion, i think the metagame is one of the most compelling.by giving players the chance to more directly manipulate the game - a sub-csm, if you will - ccp creates an unprecedented chance for players to involve themselves in the meta game in a relatively harmless way. if players screw it up, it can be slowly undone, and at the same time it creates a lasting consequence that compels players to be involved in the process.it could be as far reaching as lowsec and faction warfare, or as minimal as docking rates for ships of a certain class (but not below; we don't want to charge ships below battleship class in the off chance that a new player is aboard it).naturally, this would need to have compromises made, but while i'm a brilliant ideas-man, i'm not in a position to speak on behalf of the player base. that's why i posted this idea: i'd love to hear input on this idea to have it summarily dismissed as a bad idea, but how it can become a good idea.remember, the key is to create a mayoral system that affects regions (or heck, even systems) that can be expanded upon with ambulation/incarna. should mayors have the ability to ban certain activities? how much world-shaping can they be a part of?lets make it happen!"
5/7/2011,"ccp have revamped carriers, supercarriers (motherships), and titans. while dreads have been left in the dust.issues:reliance on siege module-- the dreadnought class ships rely solely on the siege module to perform any role. dreads need a role to play (effectively) while out of siege.lack of bonuses-- other capital ships have a plethora of ship and role bonuses, while dreads are left with a substandard 2 bonuses."

5/8/2011,"the problem with the tier system is not that it exists, it is that some of the roles within that system need revising or adjusting.case in point: the assault cruisers, omen and maller, thorax and vexor, rupture and stabber, caracal and moa. i think everyone can agree here that the only serious problems here are the 2 amarr assault cruisers and the moa. the moa's problem is probably a lot more related to railguns then anything else but the biggest problem of all is the fact that the omen and maller suck.the removal of the tier system will not fix this imbalance. in my mind's eye, the omen is the ganker, and the maller is the tanker. so the omen needs to be adjusted so that it does more damage, and in this case the fix is simple, give it enough grid and cpu to fill its high slots without gimping the rest of the ship or adjust the medium sized lasers fitting so the same result can be achieved. the maller is slightly harder, it needs to be able to tank but at the same time it needs to do less damage then the omen. the bonuses are fine here, so all that is needed in my view, is either the replacement of 2 of its turret hardpoints with missile launcher hardpoints or move a high slot to a low slot and remove a turret hardpoint. the latter would be my preferred fix, simply because it would give an extra slot to enable the pilot to fit more of a buffer and would allow more of the ships capacitor to be used for tanking.whether or not those changes are worth doing or not, is not important, but it shows that the ships balance issues can be fixed without removing the tier system.the second biggest issue with ""tiers"" in my eye is the battlecruisers.when ccp introduced the tier 2 battlecruisers, they were billed as gank boats, what did we get? gank boats that completely obsoleted the tier 1 battlecruisers in pretty much every way.how to fix this?the big one, the drake: remove that shield resistance bonus and replace it with a missile velocity bonus or launcher rate of fire bonus and make it a true mini raven. the myrmidon: in this case gallente already have a pretty decent gank bc, the brutix.(sure it suffers from the usual blaster boat issues) so what i would do is make it the tank bc, (since thats the general design of gallente drone boats anyway) so don't hate me but i would remove the rep bonus from the brutix and replace it with either a tracking bonus or some kind of speed/agility bonus to help it get into range. the myrm could then be left pretty much untouched as it follows pretty much every other rule in the drone boat philosophy.(possible change could be a high slot to a low slot but it already has one less turret then the brutix and no hybrid damage bonus, so not sure this is needed)so there you go, you don't have to scrap the teir system to fix t1 ship balance, you just have to tweak a few of the ships, most of the problems with the t1 ships themselves stem from bigger issues, like hybrids sucking, or damps making the celestis suck. take a look at the bigger issues before you try to throw a slegehammer at something a claw hammer would fix."
5/8/2011,"tier 2 bcs.first of all, the claim that ""bc > cruisers"" is kinda missing the point. bigger isn't supposed to be better in eve, it's supposed to be ""different"". the problem with bcs in general is that they're effectively better than cruisers at being cruisers, as they use the same size weapons, but have many more slots and weapons. the problem of slots is particularly apparent when it comes to what should be the definitive advantage of cruisers, mobility. the additional slots, and much greater ease of fitting, of a hurricane allows you to fit it so that it's faster, more agile and has more ehp and dps then a rupture. that should not be possible. the result is obvious - there's little reason to fly cruisers and most people just go straight to bcs instead. hence the spam of bcs everywhere.hacs versus bcs. i'm talking here about the close-range hacs, the ones that nobody ever sees, because it's much more sensible to fly a tier 2 bc instead. suckrilege and diemost are the classic offenders. even in armour-hac gangs, built to take advantage of the t2 resists, these are rarely seen, with people clearly choosing scorch instead. it's the same problem - the hurricane and drake and better than deimoses and sacrileges at being deimoses and sacrileges.people complain about destroyers being weak, and they've got a point. but quite frankly, destroyers as a class, relative to other classes, are better balanced than tier 2 bcs are. destroyers have a specific role while tier 2 bcs are just swiss army knives - too good at too many things. and this is reflected in their popularity, both for pve and pvp. within their class, the tier 2 bcs are pretty well balanced, but the class itself is overpowered."
5/8/2011,"yes, it will. ... you do realise ""no-dps brick that screams 'bait'"" is not a role, right?and did i read that correctly? you want to give it a split weapon system? are you really that stupid? do you actually think its dps isn't low enough already? rate of fire i could certainly live with, velocity is worthless. liking it.umm, sorry but that still wouldn't be fixing things. too many ships are terrible at too many things for no better reason than their tier, and buffing them as was done with the brutix basically is removing tier discrepancies.you didn't even mention what to do with the omen, which has the blindingly obvious problem of not even having enough grid to fit guns/plate/mwd. a large number of the lower tier ships need a buff in various ways (see my post on page 3(?)) to make them workable. for many of them, these buffs are very straightforward.also re:gypsio's entire post - umm, basically yeah. the hurricane imbalance is what sticks out most to me. one time me and a friend added it up. at the current prices of the region, with a modest budget fit, a cyclone would've cost 4mil more than a rupture factoring insurance - and that's when i gave up on cruisers altogether."
5/8/2011,"well, i almost agree everything you just said except that battlecruisers not only outperform by far cruisers but some of them can also easily outperform a battleship.flying gallente with 1 of my chars and all i can say, despite all roxxors demi gods better than every one, is that people must keep in mind that you fly a battlecruiser with less than 5m sp and at this point the reason wy people fly them it's just because with same skills, just about 6hours they can fly something that spit 3 times the cruiser dps and tanks tons more dps (at that lvl).now why people fly mostly bc's to pvp? -there are a few ones:-hurricanes outperforming most of any tiers bs thanks to those stupid guns being used by the most fastest race in the game can dictate distance, dps almost like his lasers counterpart at the same distance(thx drones), have a better dmg projection and weapon tracking at point blanck than blasters...there is no reason for me when i fly with my gallente char that i fly my trimarked/plated mega and his poor performances (all t2/faction fit) when i can fly an hurricane meta4 and t2 fitted that does much better in 90% of all situation i deal with where my char lives (0.3/0.2)you say bigger doesn't means better, well i'm sorry i can't agree. my hurricane full fit/rigged costs me cheaper than my 3t1 trimarks and my 2 rolled tungsten plates and now you're going to tell me story's about ""role"", i'm ok, lets do it, what's the role of a battleship in this game? -mission or fly only in fleets with over 10 men without fear the first hurricane or hac (not the deiworst oc)?if you really think it should be like this, bigger = +fragile then what's the purpose of supercaps? dev's alts and stone age players ""i win"" button? -wow, need to play that class too"

5/8/2011,"jesus guys, stop this. why dont you slap each other and stop this fight.the idea of moon mining in wh have been risen many times. the usage of those materials have been propposed to be many things: - t2 stuff like 0.0 (this i dont agree with - should be something else) - ice (instead of putting them on gravi sites) for pos fuell - new types of materials: = something required to manufacture new types of t3 ships = something required to run new types of wh specific constructions (many things have been proposed - wh stabilisers, wh spawning structures and different types of wh specific upgrades) = insert your proposal here.....more over the basic idea of moon mining have been proposed to be implemented differently than in k-sapce - for example people proposed solo mining, people would plant small structures at moon orbit that would be totally destructible by attacking forces) allowing individual players to gather the goods, and requiring constant actions (at least moving goods from structure to hangar and running new program, but may be more - maybe a little similar to pi). with a limit to ammount of structures at each moon.so, mr emperor salazar, is that good enough and elaborate enough proposal for you?"
5/8/2011,"much better, though i don't agree with most of it.t2 stuff would be a bad idea. people would farm it and then export, which would have an adverse effect on the current t2 market.ice for pos fuel is also a bad idea. that needs to be in hidden belts. ccp's current policy is that they wanted wh dwellers to have to return to k-space for something. however, i disagree with this. if people want to put in the effort to be self sustaining, they should be allowed to.more t3 ships...maybe.wh specific upgrades like the ones you are mentioning are bad ideas and would really mess up current mechanics of wh space. wh stabilizers just means making wh space easier - bad idea. and wh spawning structures just means making farming easier - also a bad idea.so really the only halfway decent option is some sort of resource for some sort of new stuff. however, you have to remember that quite frankly, wh space is one of the more ""successful"" areas of eve, thus the idea that ccp would buff it any time soon with new content is wishful thinking at best (not saying they shouldn't just saying don't get your hopes up).i do like the idea of making moon mining less of a passive action and something that can be interrupted by other players. whatever resource is there needs to be rare and hard to attain. and it needs to deplete."
5/8/2011,"yes. bookmarks... we all know what need to be done. ice, yes, limited the spawns tho so it will be put into towers, not the market hub. h3ll even a minute addition to wh content would be appreciated."
5/8/2011,"sure, not everyone have to agree. thats what discussion is all about - discuss things and not just saying ""your idea is bad, m'kay"".what i proposed here are not my proposal. its a collection of ideas regarding wh that i saw in many treads around here and f&i forums.and yes, wh will not likelly get any new content from ccp any time soon. but still, its good to have some opinion about what people are expecting and put them here - in ah for (un)likelly csm attention, and one day maybe it will be seen as agenda point at the csm summit.now regarding ice - yes it should be scarse (and dont have to be from moons) - it should be easy to get fuel for one pos, but not for 10 (and there are allies with 40+ posses in system - most of them with forcefields) wh upgrades would be nice things, but as you mentioned it is something potentially gamebreaking and would have to be well thought-out. there are some interesting ideas out there though - many connected to wh moon-mining goo.what i'm saying is, we (as wh dwellers) should and maybe even need to be here in those forums and let our voice be heard. or no matter what good and well thought ideas will be presented, they will never be even discussed by csm not to mention ccp."

5/8/2011,great ideas
5/8/2011,while i think buffing lowsec should not be done by buffing lowsec i will support any improvement of lowsec. i also happen to like this one...
5/8/2011,"because compared to the other types of space, no-one lives there?"
5/8/2011,"lowsec is much more densely-populated than both nullsec and w-space, hth."
5/8/2011,"i agree, people who don't live in low sec should stop making proposals to ""improve"" it. and the counter to those saying none live there is simple, i live there. i can also name a dozen or more 50+ man corps who live there too and that's just in my roaming area. the stats as given above also prove it. there wouldn't be any kills there if none were there to kill. yes people roam in, but for every gang roaming in looking for a fight there is another that simply lives there and is defending its turf.the reason low sec seems dead when you go on your little incursions is no one there wants to fight your 100 man incursion gang with 20 logi's. we roam around in 1 to 20 man gangs with 5 or so being the typical size. no one wants anything to do with you in low sec and we all have scout alts scattered around. we see you coming from 5 systems away and make ourselves scarce before you show up. now yes, many systems are very sparsely populated and aridia as a region is that way too. but the areas with significant resources (mostly good agents) that aren't too far from a major trade hub (that's the problem with aridia) are heavily used and many players live there."
5/8/2011,"please don't let the facts stand in the way of a good argument.anyways here's how i read it. space pirate fantasy. for 50 mil, i can set up a perma gate camp and start farming everybody without having to worry about gate guns. wanna gank others during an incursion? slap this puppy up and have at it. farm sansha and others travelling through while not having to worry about gate guns. you can even keep your sec status.there are tons of unused l4 agents in low sec right now. there are also many very high quality(q20) l4 agents as well that are not even used. there will be plenty of them out there with poor quality that will be profitable when the agent quality patch hits."
5/8/2011,"actually rather surprised this thread got some responses.to address your issues, which should be relatively obvious, though i didn't bother to go back and edit them in after all that, when i realized i had missed station undocking.stations would extend their usefulness and versatility, with the addition of new undocking areas designed for different classes of ships. currently and busy station generally has a bunch of undocking vessels meshing quite poorly, (or well if you like), as they exit the station.new undocking areas would be for frigates and destroyers, cruisers and battlecruisers, industrials and mining vessels, battleships, freighters, and capital industrial ships and capitals. simple enough.now we add an undock timer, still allowing for 20-30 second immunity on undock, make it so know ship can realign within 10 seconds of undock, and expel all ships at the same velocity from their respective undocking locations. the undock timer will be a traffic control device, which prevents ships from undocking all at once, and introduces an order of undock sequence which allows no ship to collide with another.done.anyway.. this does actually stop bots, and i'll tell you why. bots can only account for so many variables, and colliding with unknown objects is not one of them. any bot that beats this, is going to be a most complex device and cleverly crafted. most others will be outdated and incapable of the complexity required for the task.the idea is that the player has to pay attention and stear away from objects which would collide with his/her ship. maneuverability and speed of most mining craft should be enough to do this. this actually makes mining a more dynamic and interesting way to pass the time, with more danger looming than the occaisional can flipper. afk m ining would generally be out of the question as, even from relative safety some distance from the field, asteroids would move out of range and your mining activities would cease. some people might not like this, but that's a price you may have to pay.anyway.. also thought of another possible solution, so i'll move onto that now."
5/8/2011,"this is a possible solution that doesn't require banning multiple accounts, and instead allows them to choose to continue playing without their macros or quit and move on to something else."
5/8/2011,"warp to belt, turn on mining lasers, go make a cup of tea, come back to pod.no."
5/8/2011,"yes, i, too, want to punish every single player in the game because of macro miners."
5/8/2011,"this is something i've been thinking about for a while now and wanted to throw the idea out there. the primary positive consequences i see are bolded.let's say it were increased to something like 50% of the cost of creating an order. what would be the effects? these are the immediate ones i can see:1. repeated adjustments of orders would not be practical and changes to orders would be a considerable faction of the overall value.2. because of #1, micromanaging traders would be encouraged to use smaller but more numerous orders instead of moving large single orders around. so a players that is constantly managing their trading will still be able to greatly increase their market share during their active playtime. however, this type of micromanagement wouldn't lead to whale orders messing up the market values when they're offline.3. because of #1, prices would better converge to balanced market values where supply meets demand as opposed to going wherever one person wants to drive the undercutting war. (current situation)4. because of #1, #2, and #3, it would be an environment where many small orders are constantly being added, filled, and disappearing while a few larger orders farther from the currently fine tuned market value act as backstops against rapid market swings. this is a more interesting situation than a few highly micromanaged orders squishing any others, and is thus better gameplay.5. because of #4, those that do not wish to heavily micromanage their orders can more effectively use them to buy and sell goods.6. because of #2, #4, and #5, there is more room for varied types of traders: those that focus on covering locations for customer convenience, manufacturers and consumers that just want to buy/sell at a good price, those that want to micromanage a single thing, and those that want to do long timeframe investments/speculation/manipulation.7. because of #5, players that aren't really traders would be encouraged to use their order slots for passive income like they would their r&d slots.8. because of #7, more players would get into the trading thing meaning more order slots would be used and thus the overall coverage in the galaxy would improve, better serving the players with availability of items on markets."

5/9/2011,"thousands of drake users would disagree :) having now compared the 2 ships on eft, i now see that the maller's dps is indeed lower then the omen's anyway, so my changes are no longer needed, (posting at 5am for the lose). however, isn't that kind of the point, the omen is the ganker, its supposed to deal more dps then the maller, or else why fly the omen in the first place? if you can get the maller to out - dps the omen, then the omen is obsolete.reading the complaints on this very board, most people complain that the omen hasn't got enough grid and cpu to fit a full rack of lasers, and well almost anything else.i checked on eft and this is indeed true. now as to wether there should be enough grid to fit an mwd to it, well that then goes down the line of ""do we want every ship to be able to fit an mwd?"" the correct answer is it depends on where you want to fly it. or ""do we want every ship to be flown in the same way?"" ccp has already said no to this, which is why they do not want to buff the nighthawks grid to fit an mwd.set up using all level 5 character on eft[omen, new setup 1]heat sink iiheat sink iiheat sink ii800mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates iinternal force field array i10mn afterburner iifaint warp disruptor i[empty med slot]focused medium pulse laser ii, multifrequency mfocused medium pulse laser ii, multifrequency mfocused medium pulse laser ii, multifrequency mfocused medium pulse laser ii, multifrequency mfocused medium pulse laser ii, multifrequency mruns out of grid and cpu if you try to swap the afterburner to an mwd, but with standard it can hit out to 15km anyway and you can change crystals in about a second once you are closer. the biggest weakness is the fact that you have now got 4.75 cpu and 58.5 grid to fill that last medium slot.admittedly using less t2 stuff can make things easier, but if your an experienced pilot thats what you would be using most of the time.if you ask me, the biggest problem with the omen is that they gave it the 5th turret and they did not adjust its grid and cpu accordingly, or if they did, did not give it anywhere near enough to make use of that hardpoint. that is why i suggested giving it the extra grid and cpu in my last post.all the missile velocity bonus would do is make it into a long range missile boat, but then maybe we have enough of those already?the rate of fire bonus would certainly up its dps."
5/9/2011,"from my experience in eve, i feel following ships needs to be rethinked.1. eosas it stands now, this ship is really ..., hmm... i dare say that eos needs to be deleted in its current status. i understand it is a fleet commandship and it is not meant for omfgod dps. but with its ganklink bonus nearly useless, it has nothing.and it is a creodron ship. creodron, i'd like to repeat.first of all, i would like to see it to have 125 drone bandwidth. in doing so, it must have its turrent hardpoint decreased to 3. it shall not have drone damage bonus. modify its current 15+ drone bay bonus to 50+.in addition, its current 7 / 4 / 6 could be 6 / 5 / 6 (or even 6 / 5 / 5) which puts it in line of other droneboats where they have fairly balanced slot layouts.with this change, eos will be a gimped drone boat, but at least it will have enough drone bay for waves of drones for support in a small gang. 2. dominixnothing really wrong with it in its current status, but may i suggest for eve designers to rethink its current shape? it really needs a whole new design and appearance.just my 2isk. you can tell that i am a drone user and a gallentne pilot."
5/9/2011,"you mean the fools who take pve drakes into pvp? because the view the drake is nothing but bait originates from somewhere around 2006 and is hopelessly out of date.i'll repeat this for you:low-dps brick is not a pvp role. you don't win fights by sitting there with double the ehp and no dps and having only idiots engage you because you may as well have a sign over your head saying ""bait"".personally i'm in favour of the missile boat idea that's been floating around: namely give the maller hams and a drone bay. there, nicely differentiated from the omen. yes. mwd is mandatory for 90%* of pvp ships. something being completely unable to fit one alongside the lowest tier of tank and gank is utterly unacceptable. my abaddon can outrun an average afterburning cruiser.by the way your fit is an utter joke. nice overpriced damage control you've got there. i should've mentioned it needs a cpu boost as well as a significant grid boost. if anything we have too many of them, considering long range missileboat is a seriously debatable role, at best. there's a reason hml cerbs and cruise ravens are not popular in gangs. this is why in the current state of the game, a velocity bonus is a massive nerf.rof would be an acceptable tradeoff but there still exists the possibility of it being overpowered.*the 10% applying to some frigates and the odd tech 3.there are other workable ab fits but they're incredibly nich<U+FFFD> and frequently require gang links to work."
5/9/2011,"big problems here. giving it a missile velocity bonus just makes it a big fat caracal. we really don't need two almost-identical ships like that.the missile rof bonus would be, heh, interesting. if you'd find an 870 dps, 1006 dps overloaded, ham drake to be ""interesting""."
5/9/2011,"the cane is a big fat rupture and i don't see anyone complaining about that.while i could go for a tier 2 bc nerf, nerfing them down to tier 1 levels would be silly - half of the tier 1s are terrible, and the other two are only so-so. buff tier 1 bcs and nerf tier 2s so they're both sort of tier 1.5 but with different roles and you'd be there."
5/9/2011,fully support post no. 77. these are great suggestions for boosting gallente hulls.
5/9/2011,"you should have seen them back in 2006/2007 when they had those stats, a fleet of rr eos with orgre ii's were just amazing."
5/9/2011,"but that's where they belong to. one shouldn't expect much from a tech1 ship even if it's a battleship, much less a mere battlecruiser. penny-pinchers are really spoilt nowadays."
5/9/2011,every ship should have a purpose and be worth flying; reducing all bcs to the level of the prophecy would be stupid.
5/9/2011,"i'm kinda neutral on the nerf suggestion, but it does have to be said that the tier 1s are only ""terrible"" compared to the tier 2s. put a tier 1 bc against a tech 1 cruiser and the cruiser is gonna die in a fire. price difference isn't even that much factoring insurance."
5/9/2011,"yeap, that's why we need to bring tier2 down to tier1. otherwise - should ccp follow your advice - the amount of battlecruisers will be even more overwhelming than it is now.it's pretty evident, really."
5/9/2011,"also gotta admit, looking at this objectively, the stats some bcs can reach really aren't far off bs level, but with the added mobility and wallet-friendly prices.gypsio may indeed have a point on nerfing tier 2s in general. =/"
5/9/2011,"i started in the csm discussion on this topic. it seems to me the easiest fix that makes sense is setting fines up for gankers.suicide ganker pays 50% base value of target. paid to concord.each aggressor on the km has to pay the same amount. insurance is paid at 50% of insurance level-(platinum insurance x 50%)standings hit stays the same.negative isk(owed fines) activate concord bounty-hunters!!-forcing you to eject from current ship if fines aren't paid within a set amount of time.don't lie, you love the idea."
5/9/2011,"i like the i-hub hacking module idea from earlier because it's the only idea that would actually work with a small gang.ok so your small gang of 10-20 ships flies into enemy territory. they see you and try to get a home defense fleet up. during this time your group heads to the i-hub and whoever in your gang has the hacking module starts to work on one of the upgrades. only one hacking module at a time can be used on an upgrade to prevent blobbing.also hacking an i-hub upgrade might take 10 or so minutes of hacking to give the natives time to get a home defense fleet up.because hacking only takes 10 minutes the home defense fleet only has 10 minutes to form up and chase off the attackers, again this would mean that the involved fleet sizes would be on the small side.if a module gets hacked it shuts down for 6 hours. this is annoying but not crippling. that means it's worth it for a small roam to do to someone but not really worth calling a cta for.this encourages small fleet sizes for both attack and defense."
5/9/2011,"stopped reading here. there isn't a single entity in the game who can form an effective counter gang, engage and destroy 10-20 ships in 10 minutes. nor will there ever be. if we assume absolute best case scenario, there are enough people in system to counter the gang, they notice their ihub is being hacked (1 minute) and dock up (1 minute), switch to the exact counter ship they happen to have in station and undock (1 minute), warp to the ihub (1 minute) they now have 6 minutes to wipe out a 10-20 man gang. if people need to come from 2-3 jumps out they aren't even going to get in system in time.what this comes down to (every time) is you want people to be forced to engage roaming gangs with an inferior gang that will do nothing but pad your killboard. 10 minutes of effort for 1 person to shut down ratting for 6 hours is pants on head ******ed."
5/9/2011,"well i stopped reading after i read that!ok half an hour hack time, or an hour whatever. just whatever time it takes one alliance to get a home defense fleet going, but not enough time to cyno in every super-cap in whatever massive power block you are in. and maybe it only shuts down the i-hub upgrade for 2-3 hours"
5/9/2011,agree.
5/9/2011,"mechanical change would be required to make this work.you would need to increase the speed your ship increases to max warp velocity. 1s/6.0au would be a punching warp effect like in the examples provided.before you troll me to death,warping time would have to be stretched slightly.now: 5s align, 9s normal to warp, 30s warp, 9s warp to normal, doneproposal: 5s align, 1s normal to warp, 46s warp, 1s warp to normal, donethis would make time the same and would accomidate this awesome effect.dont change warp speed, it would just be a graphical change to accomidate this."
5/9/2011,supported.
5/9/2011,"i believe that any product that is truly excellent must go beyond normal constraints.i am a fan of diablo, 1 through lod i am a fan. today i wait for diablo 3 with anticipation and excitement. yet i believe that i must be patient. but in eve we already have our diablo 3. the game sits before us waiting for us to take hold and enjoy. so today i ask for something i think only a truly dedicated fan can ask for, please ccp take your time, i will continue to pay my duesand peer at your art through a tiny computer screen. you have worked long and hard,the foundation is formed, now it is time to plant the garden and paint the walls.it is time for a classic to be formed."
5/9/2011,"i agree with the op, also here is one of my ideas from another thread regarding super capitals.currently, super capital ships can be used for 'risk free' ganks.it is not uncommon for a supercarrier to log off with aggro and dissappear before anything but the largest of fleets can dispatch it.my proposal is this:super capital ships should never disappear from space. a ship that large should require the infrastructure of an empire to support it.add a new pos module for 'docking' supercapitals at a pos. this will keep them safe from bumping.this will force players to have said infrastructure to actually support these behemoths. it might also slow super capital proliferation, as people will actually have to support them logistically with fuel for the pos.this is a rough idea, but i think it has merit."
5/9/2011,"please visit your user settings to re-enable images.just a quick design i came up with, and maybe something like what i'd like to see.edit:might want to add expandable features to drones on top left, like the overview, only projecting down. also, cover neocom slider with current system and autopilot route when not in use, and add flip switch to move between the two.add double-click to chat slider to enter chat in channel; 3 second mouseover to open channel window for reading.add all fleet commands to fleet channel as text, including those from fleet command, and wing command, to squad fleet channel."
5/9/2011,"which is exactly why i mentioned it - there's some great ideas in here but even if ccp read them all and said ""great idea!"" they would never all make it to the final code. where as if we had our own customisable ui(hell the more the better), it could even be a new service ingame. another money sink that ccp's dying for."
5/9/2011,"when opening the fleet window, i am presented with ""form fleet"" and ""join fleet"". if i select ""join fleet"" i should be shown the ""find fleets"" tab, not the ""my advert"" tab, in addition the ui should populate the list with all fleets available to me.if i form a fleet and then choose to advertise my fleet, i should be shown the ""my advert"" tab, not the ""find fleets"" tab."

(notice the capitalization, -dead giveaway for corpspeak)"
5/9/2011,"this guy nailed it about as good as anybody has, imo."
5/9/2011,"well the original idea from this proposal is that sending funds from positive standing characters, to negative standing characters and vice versa should have some sec status or corp status consequence. otherwise it seems like a loophole in the system.positive standing players sending to negative standing characters should take some sort of standing penalty. while negative standing characters, like pirates, should be able to raise their standing by sending money to high sec status players but lose status with their corp if the corp is a pirate corp. this is to prevent this sending money to positive characters used as a shortcut to increase their sec status. i think that the rate of sec status gain should be less than sec status loss. (its harder to buy your reputation up to good again, than it is to let a good reputation slip into bad)now how can we tell what a pirate corp is? is there a good way to do this? perhaps the status of the ceo? i'm open to ideas here."
5/9/2011,"@the baddie1. if your reading comprehension is too low to have found the complete lists, i can not help you. considering it makes no difference anyways, i don't know what you're smoking.2. if you can't manage to recognize half a dozen pirates who took par"
5/9/2011,"you seem to use the terms standing and security status interchangeably. these are two very different concepts. to avoid confusion, are you in fact referring to security status the whole time?i still see this as an idea that addresses a problem that doesn't really matter. remember that this is a persistent world that is meant to be played for entertainment purposes. the most fun that this particular persistent world offers is (player) ship to (player) ship combat.not only that, but the entire economy revolves around the construction and destruction of ships. if players are strongly discouraged from engaging in ship to ship combat, ships don't get destroyed. if ships don't get destroyed, they don't need to be built again. if ships don't need to be built, industrialists are out of work. if industrialists are out of work and combat pilots can't pew pew, then what the hell is left to do?implementing this proposal in any form would be game breaking. still not supported."
5/9/2011,"i don't follow how making sec status rules consistent automatically make people pvp less. that it may just change the way the economy of piracy a bit, but in my opinion, if pirates are only viable if funded by carebear alts, then the profession needs some fixing on its own.good point, i mean sec status (for good->bad transfers) and sec status and standings (with your pirate corp) changes for bad->good transfers. (you get a sec status boost if you donate to a good toon and you are a pirate, but you may lose standing with your corp. (admittedly this is only a thought at this point and probably not the best way to handle this)at the end of it all, i am for free markets and economy, within a consistent set of rules with minimal loop holes, which in the end will foster professions of all sorts (pvp and pirates included) to flourish under their own right. not be artificially propped up by a loophole.for example, if this was implemented, then players will perhaps spend more time playing as the pirate to earn cash, instead of just playing as a carebear, gathering enough cash, hop into a pirate alt to shoot some things with the carebears funds, then log off again to rat as the carebear. to me, that make piracy a shadow profession, and its use in the universe is more like a meta-game, and not people who 'live' in the game the same way as the other professions.okay, so i'm getting a little rpg on you now, i apologize :)"
5/9/2011,"what does this mean? do you mean i lose standings with pirate corps i might mission with, or do you mean i lose standings with the player run corp i'm a member of?also, how and why does this affect people like me who live in nullsec? i'm twenty jumps from concord, why should they care who i send money to?"
5/9/2011,"i don't follow how current security status rules are inconsistent. if they are, what's inconsistent about them? in fact, i'd say that having a pirate (as defined by security status) paying a law abiding character to gain sec status would also be ""inconsistent"". why would the pirate be less of a pirate simply by being involved with a law abiding citizen? shouldn't the law abiding citizen just take a sec status hit for receiving ""dirty money""?to clarify my point, the proposal wouldn't directly make people pvp less, but it would be a further discouragement to losing security status, thereby providing a disincentive to go around blowing up ships.i have plenty of alts with which i transfer cash back and forward between. most are trade alts, but some are pvp alts. this proposal would discourage me from engaging in piracy with any of my alts (currently i almost exclusively fight in nullsec anyway, so security status isn't an issue) because it would just cause a chain reaction that would hamper my regular business. it just makes a big pita (like pi) for no good reason (unlike pi).which then begs the question - how would this proposal improve eve's gameplay exactly? i propose that it would make for more convoluted empire rules that only serve to confuse (and add a platform to grief) new players."
5/9/2011,"that is a good point. i thought at first that it would only apply to npc corp standings through some formula akin to how your faction standings are modified when you do enough missions for a corp in the faction or against it. except that we take for a pirate faction all corps which are npc rats. (guristas, bloods, angels, sanshas)the point of null sec is a valid point. at first i thought that maybe all transactions would be 'monitored' but it goes against the nature of free-4-all in null sec, as somebody pointed out. so i think that if the characters have a home system that is not in empspace, then this penalty should not apply."
5/9/2011,"hmm, yes perhaps just the one sided hit for the law abiding citizen would be enough. my thought was that pirates can earn back status by 'donating' to good causes and corps, but i think this would be a bad idea.not sure i agree with you here, why would it discourage anyone to losing status? a pirate is going to be a pirate regardless of these rules, and transferring money between pirates (neg status to other neg status players) have no penalty. what this rule would reflect is the real fact that if you are funding pirates, then you are becoming a pirate in the process... (albeit slowly).so are you saying that without your trader alt, your pirate would not be able to sustain a regular source of income doing pirate things (like gank, hold for random, steal, and run missions for pirate corps?) if this is the case, then this is my point exactly. if this is true, then the pirate profession is gimped and needs fixing, (a proposal of how would be out of scope for this discussion)because i think that piracy or 'bad' professions should not be a meta game feature (make $$$ with a good alt, then transfer $$$ to a low sec alt to play bad boy for a day) but be a real part of the economy. incidentally, i think the new black market booster trade coming in incarna may make smugglers and pirates more of a real profession. a working bounty system would too. so why is this loophole hurting the eve universe? well imho, and you are free to disagree,1) it's hiding a problem with piracy profession, which is gimped, and ccp is avoiding fixing it. a pirate toon should be able to play pirate 100% without meta-help from a 'good' alt.2) meta-games are an artificial factor in the economy, which sees money flowing not because of true supply and demand, but because players are just moving cash between 'good' and 'bad' alts, essentially allowing 'good' toons to commit crimes (like assassination) without any sec rating consequences. (that's the inconsistent part)3) it gimps the bounty system. if there were sec penalties for moving money to an alt to kill someone, then you would have to resort to posting bounties on people if you want them dead, which creates a true market demand, competition, and jobs for 'bad' players! which is good!"
5/9/2011,"the one topic that i am still struggling with is whether or not nullsec players should be subject to the same rules. on one hand, concord does not police null sec, and doing anything will not affect your security status. so a -10 pirate killing someone in nullsec, vs a 5.0 player in nullsec, killing somebody are treated no differently, and neither of them are considered to have committed any crimes. so we would want to preserve that 'spirit of the law' in nullsec.the problem with locality is when is a player considered a 'null sec' player, and when are they considered an 'emp space' player? clearly we would ideally want this rule to apply only to empsec players. but how can we classify the player?one choice is we can use the 'home system' of the player, which is where their med clone is located. this is clear cut, but allows for exploit by way of moving med clones around.another choice is to use the corp of the player. so what would make a corp 'good' or 'bad'? one idea is maybe make 'restrict isk transfers' be a choice that the ceo of the corp can set on/off. if set on, then isk xfers to criminals would incur sec status penalties, if off then nothing would happen. so then why would any corp want to set this setting to 'on' to restrict their members? we could incentivize the corp somehow, perhaps by way of lower taxes, or a tax rebate from concord on all bounties collected (because they are 'compliant' to the concord clean money xfer laws).this way, carebear corps that enforce this level of financial reporting will have all members subject to the penalties, but the members in corp in general will make more isk; or a corp can choose not to report finance xfers of its members to concord (pirate corps, or null sec corps), and there will be no penalties to isk xfers. i think that this half solution should keep most people in the universe happy, and achieve the goal of keeping the clean money earned by carebear or mining corps clean, while enforcing a more clear in-game (as opposed to meta-game) segregation between the 'good' and 'bad' professions in the game, and the respective parts they play in the economy. it also sets a good foundation to when ccp fleshes out the 'bad' professions more, with the black market changes and incarna."
5/9/2011,earn bountiesget rebateceo changes corp settingstransfer moneyceo changes corp settings backi think that this whole proposal would increase the learning curve at a time when ccp is trying to lessen it (cq npe rework).
5/9/2011,"""less"" griefing compared to high sec? explain how high sec is more griefing when there's stronger security around, security that punishes, not protect. if u cannot adapt to that, then that's your fault for taking high sec for granted as a wow-style sanctuary to hide behind on an alt. the only possible way this would be ""griefing"" to u is your alt flying an expensive carebearing ship, thinking high sec is 100% safe but here's the thing: since u choose to undock even in high sec, u chose to go somewhere u can be shot at so that's not griefing either.so yes, u r talking out of your ass.it is for u when u still don't show your work because the burden of proof still falls on u. if u're mentally incapable of doing even that, then go back to whining some more."
5/9/2011,"no, that's not what i'm saying - i'm only commenting on my own personal choice, and what would be a pita, not about whether an entire profession is economically viable or not.my pvp alts are there for fun, not for profit. this is where i fundamentally disagree with the proposal - because it would make the pvp part of the game less fun. simple as that.btw, while i am very much against your proposal i'd like to thank you for listening to feedback and providing reasonable counterpoints without misinterpreting anything that disagrees with you and throwing a tanty and getting insulting (ie anna's posts). it's really quite refreshing.try not to misinterpret what i've said. i thought i quite clearly explained how shooting somebody in lower security space is less griefing, but for your benefit, i'll indulge.sure, the ""place they can be shot at"" includes highsec, but there are as i said (usually) ""very short sharp consequences for it (concord)"". there are ""less"" consequences (game mechanic enforced anyway) for shooting people in lower security space, therefore, shooting in lower security space is less griefing. i would argue that in nullsec, shooting somebody isn't griefing at all, it's just the pvp area of the game that you chose to be in and expect to be shot at (even by blues) and lose ships. so to explicitly clarify (*sigh*), when i said ""place they can be shot at"", i was also implicitly inferring the previously stated ""with less consequences"" part too.please note i never said anything about highsec being a ""wow-like sanctuary"" or ""100% safe"" (ie, you're presenting a strawman here)."
5/9/2011,"meh, anna is incapable of doing anything except misinterpret, you get used to it.@baddie""show your work"" lol, i've no need to spell out the obvious, honestly i'd thought i had dumbed it down enough for you, do i need to explain how addition works or were you confused by the percentages? why continue crying and demanding proof you apparently can't understand? i'm fairly sure there's not even a point to your qq as amusing as it is, and if you're too mentally stagnant and/or inept at eve to wrap your mind around a chart of 10 alliance/corps it's simply not my concern."
5/9/2011,"the war dec system needs to change, at the moment, anyone can war a single corp without anything bad happening. maybe some people don't want to constantly be attacked for no apparent reason?"
5/9/2011,that would be the point.come up with a better system or stfu.
5/9/2011,"if you can pay concord to look the other while you war dec a corp/alliance then why can't you pay concord to cease a war ?examplecorp a war decs corp b (2 mil per week)corp b pays concord to remove the war dec (4 mil)corp a really wants the war dec so war dec again( 8 mil)corp b is an industrial corp and pays concord again (16 mil)this goes on until corp a or b no longer pays concord. each time concord is involved the fee doubles.quite quickly this can lead to a massive isk sink.i know what people will say, "" hire some mercs "" but why can't i hire concord ?"
5/9/2011,eve online was about taking big risks to gain great rewards. what's the point if you're always at risk of non consensual pvp in high sec? what exactly is the gain on either party in high sec? a one man corp war decing a bunch of hulks just to pad his stats on battleclinic?this was the intended result?
5/9/2011,"wait wait wait. let me see if i understand your post.you start by saying 'eve online was about taking big risks to gain great rewards.', then you immediately contradict yourself by asking for the removal of risk? what?"

5/9/2011,"new type of scan probe that can be launched as normal and moved to any position in space. once there, it can be deployed for corporation or player as a beacon visible to corporation and alliance, or current fleet and the deploying individual respectively. the beacon will last up to two hours, and provide a warp-in point similar to an, (scanned down to 100%), anomoly. use prior to deployment will be same as for a combat scan probe, with limited scanning abilities of 0.25 au and low scanning strength."
5/9/2011,why?what are you trying to solve?
5/9/2011,"solve? nothing directly. the idea is to have the ability to warp to an unknown location in space, and to have various other uses besides. you can use it to create safespots, fleet rally points, drop points, and whatever else you happen to like it for. it's a tool.currently, we can only warp to celestial objects, or scanned down ships, anomalies, and the like. safespots are only available by bookmarking during warp between two points, or logging off in space and bookmarking on login. that's actually quite limited, and doesn't really provide a realistic means of navigation."
5/9/2011,what is realistic about warp navigation and more importantly how is your proposal more realistic?
5/9/2011,what would happen if i was a passenger on a hauler and the hauler was blown up ?do i wake up in a new clone ?when i log in do i appear in local where the hauler was destroyed ?
5/9/2011,"you either wake up in a new clone if you were part of the destroyed cargo, or into 'kidnapped' gui if you survived. depends if you are floating in space and not picked up by a pirate or not. if you were picked ip you will be kidnapped as described before. if you are floating in space then after a certain amount of time ( the standard non anchored can persistence time ) you will be rescued by interbus and show up at the closest station."
5/9/2011,"if the passenger player could 'self destruct' and abort the trip (defaulting the contract payment to the hauler), that would be good. otherwise the hauler could delay things to the absolutely last minute. in effect, the hauler has the ability to keep the passenger player out of the game (not entirely, but anything involving a ship, which is just about everything) after accepting the contract. in the case of pirates, if the passenger player can't pay the ransom, the pirates would be able to keep them out of the game indefinitely. if the passenger player can self destruct to escape the contract and the ransom, then the capturing/ransoming mechanic is pointless, since no one will pay the ransom. pirates could also ask for an unreasonably large ransom, guaranteeing the player couldn't pay it. griefing will be extended to include actually keeping people from playing. and that's not good. the core idea of player passenger travel is good, but the interesting, creative tidbits you've added on to it have some real issues. also from a usage angle, for what purpose would a player travel without a ship? the only really good answers i can come up with are avoiding travel through dangerous areas like losec/nosec (which only protects your ship) and avoiding having to make a bunch of jumps in hisec. autopilot handles the latter and what good is it to be in losec/nosec without a ship of any kind? so why pay someone to move you?"
5/9/2011,i can see this working but would need a tweak here and there thats already been listed. but i'll give you a thumbs up in support
5/9/2011,weren't you that guy who got those people to blow up my hulk?
5/9/2011,people who play the game the way i play it (the correct way) should have their votes count more than people who play the game the way you play it (the wrong way). sure there are fewer of me but thats just because not everyone can be as smart as me and you have to be pretty smart to play the game the way i play it (the correct way) otherwise i would be playing some other way.
5/9/2011,"yeah the mittani directly ordered three pilots to infiltrate crystal industries and disrupt a mining operation, hehget real"
5/9/2011,"the mittani can sodomize kittens in his free time for all i care, just so long as he gets results."
5/9/2011,"currently on sisi the loyalt point modifier skills have been given the axe. so skills like military connections will no longer be there when you log in for the next patch that goes live. now i have run some missions, and comparing to what i and others have earned lp wise for a missions it seems to be a bit less than what is currently live on tranq. first off i want to call upon ccp to explain what exactly they are doing as far as loyalty points go, because so far this is looking like it is a loyalty point nerf. keep in mind this doesn't just affect all lvl 4 high sec mission carebears. this affects all lvls of missions, in all securities of space. if this is indeed another nerf to missions i vote no! pending any word from ccp i propose not to lose these lp modifier skills."
5/9/2011,i have no problem with the possible removal of loyalty point modifier skills as long as we get the sp's back like we did with learning skills. it has always seemed more than a little odd to me that any additions to lp earned come from a group of skills rather than from the level of your standing with the faction or corp you are running missions for.
5/9/2011,iirc your loyalty point reward does go up as your standings with the agent go up.hmmm i have to say i am pro nerfing missions. brings more balance to the null sec/high sec risk/reward. personally i would have preferred to see them do it through dropping mission rewards and bounties though as by dropping lp payouts your dropping the isk sink a little.
5/9/2011,"sarina, your right. it's been so long since i've done a mission i forgot that."
5/9/2011,"it's potentially a catastrophic nerf to lvl5's. i'm updating sisi right now to take a look but if we are really talking about a 33% reduction in lp pay for lvl5's, then high sec lvl4's might actually pay more per mission and per hour. the reason is lvl5's frequently pay less actual isk than lvl4's but they pay far more in lp. with such a drastic reduction in lp, it looks pretty dodgy to me. but as said, i still need to look for myself."
5/9/2011,"this is precisely the problem tbh, although it does effect all missions. lvl 5 missions will be hit the hardest. for example tranquility live ""wrath of angels"" mission pays 80k lp per mission. on sisi the payout is 65k lp per mission with the new changes. that is just an insane drop in lp payment, and huge mega nerf for lvl 5 missions."
5/9/2011,it would also be a nerf to low sec lvl 4 missions.edit: but i am sure ccps causality models predict something else
5/9/2011,this may be a precursor to the removal of agent quality as well. this coupled with that leading to a little less lp seems a.o.k. with me.
5/9/2011,"a ""little"" less lp seems a.o.k how? how is 30-40% less lp considered a little? also are you freaking high? no wait you must be a proud owner of rat bots, or mining bots so this will only increase your rmt business sales. better yet this will increase ccp's plex sales. now i know why this is being done......."
5/9/2011,"i finally finished updating sisi, results are as follows:10.0 personal standing for the lvl5 republic fleet agent in auga (0.4 sec), rogue spy (1 of 3): 73k lp on tq, 60k lp on sisi.10.0 personal standing for the lvl5 imperial navy agent in sahtogas (0.3 sec), rogue spy (1 of 3): 78k lp on tq, 65k lp on sisi.i rejected multiple missions to see if standings had any impact on payout, my test showed no such thing. it is possible that standings may only be counted up to a certain point however. and since lvl5's require 8.6 standing on tq (7.0 on sisi) to accept, you can't drop it too much. both results show a 17-18% lp payout reduction. not nearly as serious as the 33% reduction predicted from the loss of the 50% bonus from skills but it's still pretty heavy handed. i find this particularly true since i don't know of anyone who thinks lvl5's should be nerfed. i did not check lvl4's and tbh i haven't run one of those in years."
5/9/2011,meh. missions could use a nerf.
5/9/2011,they're making agent quality dynamic rather than static.this means less-heavily used agents = better lp.
5/9/2011,enough said.
5/9/2011,"will agent quality be removed, or does it stay the same as it is now?answer"
5/9/2011,"i, for one, support this new change.-1 to the proposal. this rocks. ^^"
5/9/2011,it appears to be removed on sisi as does the effective quality description. that said security status still clearly impacts the agent's actual payouts.
5/9/2011,"the 11% tax on npc corps was a poorly thought idea and cheap way for ccp to nerf mission runner income. that's allit really was, an irritating tax to force pilots to leave over chump change. it didn't make me or many others leavebecause we have our own reasons for staying in a npc/rookie corp. i'll give ccp props for the pathetic attemptat describing the tax as a some added immersion one would have if in a ""real"" player corp. any rules forcing pilots out of a npc corp have to be very specific, not time based and put in for a reason. thistax wasn't it. this is a sandbox after all and if pilots want to stay in a npc/rookie corp they should be able to.if ccp really wanted pilots to leave they would design tangible benefits for joining a player corp that would beabsent in the npc/rookie corps. even so that wouldn't guarantee pilots leaving. doesn't matter though, ccp got somepilots to leave so mission accomplished!"
5/9/2011,isk sink. solo guy corps can be wardeced.
5/9/2011,"as my tusker pirate colleague pointed out lowsec itself is very different populated just like 0.0. the are several hotspot regions like black rise, metropolis, molden heath, aridia, placid and genesis. sure there are systems in that regions which are quiet and empty but there are also several hotspots systems in each of the regions i named, some are famous like oms, tama and amamake some are not.anyway the major problem with lowsec from my point of view is from a very different angle. it<U+FFFD>s the security penalty, this is not a problem for a fulltime pirate as the pirate has alts to secure logistic and whatelse is needed. the full time pirate is used to it and deal with it. the security penalty is a big problem for part time pirates / highsec dwellers who just wants to roam, check out, shoot, looking for pvp etc pp. there is no way i can see to get a fulltime highsec carebear into lowsec but without any security penalty in lowsec the more risk adverse highsec player may have a closer look. as it is now most highsec player fear the security penalty as they may can<U+FFFD>t get back into safe haven after the lowsec roam. that has to be changed just make lowsec so you won<U+FFFD>t get any security penalty for shooting anybody."
5/9/2011,so every time i log in for the day i'll have to online a new ebu because some 14 year olds blew it up while i was at work. no thanks.
5/9/2011,"i am given to understand by older players that bookmarks, in the past, could cause severe system lag if someone started copying massive numbers of bookmarks all at once, and thus bookmark copying was limited to 5 at a time. however, manually copying only five at a time is tedious if one wants to copy a large number of bookmarks, especially multiple sets thereof to share with alts, friends, corpmates, and/or alliancemates.i propose that players once again be allowed to mass-copy bookmarks, but in such a way that the operation can be spread out over time to prevent lagging out systems. when a player attempts to copy a large number of bookmarks, the game should put up a confirmation dialog saying ""copying this many bookmarks at once will require approximately [insert time estimate here], during which you will not be able to dock, jump, or change ships. you might also experience significant lag. this is best done docked in a station. are you sure you wish to proceed?"" the player can then dock up in a station, proceed with a mass-copy operation, and then walk away from the computer to go get a sandwich or something while waiting on the copy operation."
5/9/2011,"so if i sit in a system for 2+ hours in a cloaked ship waiting for someone to pass by and no one does then i get logged offcause there was nothing for me to do? idea not supported, too vague. what constitutes inactivity? the very nature of having thecloaking module on in a cloaked ship implies activity. if i make my cloaked ship orbit a random object in space and afk theni've beaten the timer cause my ship is doing ""something"". the problem isn't the timer but what constitutes inactivity. ccpwould have to define what it means to do nothing which makes this idea unworkable."
5/9/2011,good idea!supported as well as need to define what would considered as inactivity.edit: forgot thumb up lol
5/9/2011,only if the pilot in question is docked at a station. any other scenario would be too detrimental to a great many local intelligence agencies.
5/9/2011,not supported. good scouts often spend long periods of time cloaked and watching systems. it's nobodies business if a pilot is afk but their own.
5/9/2011,"super capitals are large in size, much larger than a standard capital ship. as such they should require a more substantial lock onto a cyno field in order to jump to it.my proposal is to limit the strength of a cyno field, similar to wormhole strength. therefore a single cyno may be able to support 30 capitals in one go, or 5 super capitals at once.now, if you want to cyno 120 super carriers and 30 titans onto a field of battle you will need at minimum 16 active cyno's in order to get your fleet in. once the cyno's strength has been depleted the cyno field deactivates but the ship that activated the field is still stationairy for the 5 - 10 minutes it normally would take.this can be active for titan bridges too.sub caps - 100 per cynocapital - 30 per cynosuper caps - 5 per cyno"
5/9/2011,"the main problem with this is a cyno is not a wh creator. by eve lore for capitals a cyno is effectively a large energy source beacon which capital navigation computers can lock onto and use their jump drive. therefore by lore this cannot be done, however there has been talk of making different types of cynos similar to covert / regular to limit ships that travel through."
5/9/2011,"add the following to the lore and it would work: ""each jump to a cyno causes feedback, the intensity of which is based on the mass of the jumping ship. eventually, the beacon has to shut down or risk the destruction of the next ship that jumps."""
5/9/2011,"so you find the only bad thing about this proposal to be that it does not fit with the ""lore""why not make it so that jumps in proximity to a cyno disrupt it? there are many other ways one could explain why it would be possible to only jump a limited number of ships to a cyno."
5/9/2011,"wouldn't really change anything except making capital blobbing slightly more annoying (by requiring a little more coordination).plate bs pops initial cyno, first wave of capitals through all pop cynos .. poof fully established blob on scene.now one could disallow cyno gens to be mounted on capitals to prevent that, but then you are giving a massive boost to defensive/turtling tactics while making titans mandatory for any serious battle (bridge in cyno ships).in short: not a very good idea."
5/9/2011,"there are still more than enough carriers arround to make cynos then. first cyno gets in 30 carriers, they all pop a cyno and you can get in 150 supers. and carriers barely sacrifise anything by fitting a cyno, not being able to move as carrier is also pretty irrelevant in supercap fight."
5/9/2011,this. i'm with you on the intent behind it but such a restriction could be easily gamed.
5/9/2011,"most battle-fit carriers have cynos anyway. this really wouldn't change too much, other than allowing the carriers to get out of their cyno stasis sooner. in short, this would actually be a boost to large fleet warfare."
5/9/2011,"nonsense, battle-fit carriers have four dcu's and a salvager, silly!"
5/9/2011,"let's have it. optional first-person like mode with wasd, (up, left, down, right), controls, and velocity controlled by scrolling the mouse wheel or button 4 and 5 or something remappable.i can't say the difficulty in implementing this, but it seems most of the elements are already present."
5/9/2011,"this is the 500th thread on this subject, congratulations, you win first person mode.unfortunately, first person mode is a black screen, since you are seeing the inside of an unlit, goo filled pod."
5/9/2011,"nope, most of the elements are certainly not present such as the predictive ai that each client would need to run to reposition where each ship *might* be. this sort of thing would be needed because of network latency (the time it takes for the command from your keyboard to reach the server, and then be redistributed around to other clients who need that info, ie those on grid with you), and without it things (ships mainly) would jump all over the place as your machine catches up with the latest version of the network data.ccp have dodged having to use a whole pile of network traffic by having basic commands that you send to the server (approach this, orbit that, activate this module on that object etc) which capture the movement that you want to do in a very efficient way. this works well for a system that is hosted in one place and services the entire world simultaneously, in fact it enables such a system to run at all.your alternative might be good for an fps hosted on a geographically close server and played by at most 2 digits of players, where each player is constantly sending movement commands (move forward, slightly left, forward, forward, right, right, forward, forward, forward, etc) and where ping is such an important factor in how you can perform. eve is not that game."
5/9/2011,"you've got the black screen part, but because of the lag wasd would produce in fleets."
5/9/2011,"so, i would guess you're saying the bubble system doesn't cut it. i get that wasd add's a lot more in the way of directional modifiers, but a lot of players double-click to change direction continuously in pvp. that's probably minus about a hundred commands a second or so i guess, with the amount of control applied by incremental movements.anyway, bad idea i guess; just thought i'd throw it out there to see what response it got. informative reply, thank you.i posted a pseudo first person mode in the summit thread on ships i think it was. just inverted cam's over the ship, and using the standard double-click for directional modification. would at least give the impression of first person mode, without any real alterations to game mechanics, aside from the way the cameras acted."
5/9/2011,"i am unsure about this idea, because i tried ""black prophecy"" and ""battlestar galactica"" games. it is extremely unbalanced, because navigation speeds are so far from realistic. close combat combined with leak of target locking and tracking options is cause of intense screen glimmer and migraine.in another hand having target locking and tracking options makes unnecessary such type of control. pilot needs just lock and shoot.however, pilot can navigate by clicking twice in the space and that is good enough."
5/9/2011,how about a ton of coding and rewriting of the game as we know it?sounds pretty easy right?
5/9/2011,"i can; it'd be a right pain in the ass to implement and would probably require ten times the server resources. the eve server runs at 1 fps internally. shifting control to client side would also introduce performance and security problems, and if you didn't do it, controls would be clunky as all hell to the point of being practically unplayable.this isn't even speaking of the fact that eve just isn't designed around that kind of gameplay.sorry. as much as i love being a fighter pilot, this is a game about being a spaceship captain."
5/9/2011,i think you may be exaggerating the danger a bit.
5/9/2011,"ok this might sound totally crazy but you might be able to fix macro mining the way you fixed rmt with plex. just make marco mining part of the game.first introduce a macro mining module. since most hulks are shield tanked have it take up a mid slot and use a s***load of cpu. basically while mining you target whatever can you are using then use the macro miner module on it. the module automatically dumps whatever ore is in your hold into the can. and if a roid gets mined out, the macro miner module starts cycling on any other roids you have targeted.second give all mining barges a huge amount of maximum targets. this would make training the multitasking skill worthwhile.third if you are worried about runaway inflation on minerals due to everyone mining 23/7 just make the roids give out fewer units per cycle. so if you assume people will mine 5 times as much on average make the mining output 1/5 as much.you could even think of this from an rp standpoint. imagine you are a capsuleer who just bought a new mining barge, what's the first thing you'd want to do. i'd program the ship to mine on it's own like a big drone or something while i go get a sandwich. because no sentient creature would willingly inflict the boredom of asteroid mining on themselves."
5/9/2011,everyone claims the forge citizenship.
5/9/2011,supercarrier nerf = dread revamp
5/9/2011,fixed it for ya. fixing sc does not make dreads work out of siege mode
5/9/2011,fixing supercarriers might mean that entering siege mode without supercap supremacy is no longer an act of suicide though.

5/9/2011,"what is the problem you're trying to solve? the current system is working just fine, allows the markets to adjust rapidly to changes in supply/demand dynamic and allows the manipulation of the market making it a more interesting system for traders to play with. yes this means tricking .01 isk micromanagers too, so you can profit from people blindly outbidding you.the current system can also be used for easy passive income already, so the current ability to micro manage orders doesn't prevent that. it just means you have to think for a second at what price point are you going to put your order up and how large you're going to make it.you also can't be serious about the cost of altering an order. it would freeze many orders on the market and stagnate the whole system or you'd have to increase the number of orders used by manyfold to compensate. the number of orders is already too small on one character for a serious trader and you want to make a system that is designed in a way that people have to split their orders to multiple small ones or stop playing the current market games entirely.basicly i see some serious downsides to this and can't see what significant benefit your proposal would provide for the system or the players that would warrant such a change."
5/9/2011,"alright, here are a few of these things in terms of problems:problem:trading is rather robotic in the sense of maintaining market orders. this makes it ripe for botting and such. while that is not in and of itself a reason to change it, it is symptomatic of poor gameplay. i think many people would agree that maintaining market orders feels like a chore. how this helps:it makes price something you have to actually think about. this means trading becomes an activity about thought, decision, and consequence as opposed to who performs the same repetitive action over and over the most.problem:the market buy and sale values for a given item tends to move like a train of lemmings and that does not represent a balanced market value. therefore it leads to all the orders getting filled and none being left, or backed up amounts of stock in certain items and yet the prices still don't move toward a value at which they will sell. it's a broadly shared feeling that changing your price doesn't generally do much to improve your sales, it more or less just decreases margins for all the traders. how this helps:with players thinking more about setting things at the correct price, the market maintains a more balanced market value where orders live healthy lifecycles and buy and sell orders are less likely to get backed up or stripped. furthermore, larger orders are more likely to be used with larger margins meaning they will act as a buffer against wild market changes as opposed to acting as a wall right on the current market value that prevents smaller orders from going through."

5/9/2011,"such as, if you change corps - having the ownership of the pos follow you without having to unanchor and reanchor it? such as, being able to store items into some storage that others can not access? i believe you can anchor a can with a password prior to the shields going up - but once the shields are up, an individual has no storage within a pos.such as, having corp members who become more willing to anchor poses because they know that they don't need to have roles to access the pos - so even if things go sour, they can get their stuff out.heck, individuals fly their own ships in this game - if it were a ""true mmo"", we'd all be crew members on a single ship. right? if the game were initially designed as crew members on a ship, and someone posted the idea that people should be allowed to fly their own ships, would you be one of those saying ""but then it won't be an mmo!!!"" ? of course you would."
5/10/2011,gj thx
5/10/2011,"good idea, would deffinaly solve some issue's. most t2 ships have 2 or more variants, exept the black op's."
5/10/2011,"iirc the qen works by taking a snapshot at a given moment of how many of a certain ship is being piloted. bops are an extremely niche ship and will only be flown when being used as apposed to titans that have to have a pilot in them at all times.my point ?a) the qens snapshot can be borderline useless as it doesnt take into account length of time the ship is flown or the number of a particular ship owned. i am pretty sure if you counted up the number of bops owned it would exceed titans by a extreme margin.b) quoting qen as a reason to buff bops is a flawed argument.however i am in favour of buffing bops, but not their base stats. i would only buff their jump range and either decrease the amount of fuel it takes to bridge people or the increase the amount of fuel they can hold in their fuel bay.the fact they cant bridge a proper recon fleet to their max jump range due to fuel limitations i think is what cripples them the most. they are and should be imo a mini titan (overpriced and only really useful for bridging gangs on-top of people) and should relatively weak for any type of solo work.tldr: only buff jump range and either increase their fuel bay or decrease the amount of fuel they require to jump"
5/10/2011,don't nerf.buff!..next thing you know we'll all be flying glass hulls with pee shooters.. cripes!
5/10/2011,battlecruisers aren't used anything like 'overwhelmingly' and haven't been for around 6-9 months now since people switched to abaddons and maelstroms and began comfortably demolishing drake fleets over and over again. nerfing them at this stage would be pointless and stupid.
5/10/2011,"eve-kill is down atm, but last time i looked, drakes and hurricanes were more common than maels and abaddons, and when you look at the overall top 20, ships that are primarily used in small-scale fights are noticeably more common than those used in fleet warfare. even with a massive allwar on, large-scale fleet pvp (probably) accounts for a minority of all kills in the game, and tier 2 battlecruisers really are ubiquitous in smaller fights."
5/10/2011,nice slogan. shame it lacks any actual argument.you do realise there is a time and a place for both?
5/10/2011,"this argument deals only with the balance of tier 2 bcs vs. bs in the fleet environment. it does not address tier 2 bc balance in other pvp enviroments (as pointed out, they're ubiquitous in small-gang stuff), and it does not deal with the balance of tier 2 bcs vs. cruisers and close-range hacs (sac and deimos, although you can add auto-muninn at a pinch).as also noted by others, the tier 1 bcs only look terrible when compared to the tier 2s - they're still quite capable of kicking in the faces of a cruiser or two. but their fewer slots and generally trickier fittings means that it's a lot harder to make a tier 1 bc better than a cruiser at being a cruiser.leaving aside the nerf issue for a second, it's indisputable that the balance between tier 1 and 2 bcs is awful, with the result that there's little reason to fly the tier 1s. so it's self-evident that either tier 1s need boosting, or that tier 2s need nerfing. the normal response has been to propose boosting the tier 1s - but i believe that there are fundamental problems with the balance of tier 2s, relative to cruisers, close-range hacs and even field cs, and that these problems strongly argue that the tier 1s are a better model for bcs than the tier 2s.i don't expect proposing a nerf to probably the most used group of ships in the game to be a popular suggestion, and frankly i don't expect ccp to enforce it, cos it'll just **** off too many people. hell, the first time i saw the argument for nerfing the tier 2s, i reacted angrily too. but over the next day or two my reaction was something like this but angrier at the start and in extreme slow motion."
5/10/2011,"i'm gonna admit i hadn't actually considered a nerf to tier 2s as the solution but looking at it now, it does make sense. the cyclone is a very usable bc, as is the brutix and the ferox but the prophecy i believe needs a fundamental rethink. ccp don't appear to understand the concept that being a no-dps brick is an extremely nich<U+FFFD> role, if it can be called a role at all.it probably wouldn't be too hard to tone the tier 2s down a bit while keeping their roles distinct. caldari - guns vs missiles. simple enough really.gallente - gank vs tank. myrm would still have enough dps to be worth flying but more staying power than a brutix. amarr - just go back to the drawing board with the prophecy, to be honest. i'm in favour of the ham suggestion personally. does the harbinger really need much of a nerf?minmatar - i'm not sure what to suggest here, but frankly the hurricane is the poster-ship for the cruiser-bc imbalance. it has the speed and agility of a cruiser and the firepower and tank of a bc. not sure what to suggest nerf-wise here to be honest."
5/10/2011,"one should always keep in mind that in computer games combat strength is relative. so the point of boosting all the other things - instead of nerfing just one - on grounds of 'progress' being made and other rp crap is nothing else but a pathetic demagogy. game development is not a rl history. and it's always easier and better to bring down one overpowered ship instead of making all the others equally overpowered, which at the end of the day inevitably results in everything becomming equally mediocre. it's nice to deal 1000 dps when your rivals deal just 500, but what's the point in having 2000 when everyone else has 2000 as well and tanks proportionally better? it's just a useless inflation of game values.let's think for a second that ccp indeed becomes insane (i mean even more insane than they're now ) and boosts tier1 bc up to tier2 level. but they can not make them 100% equal with tier2, so these new shiny tier1 bc will occupy another role - a role which atm belongs to some completely unrelated hulls. nowadays close-range hacs are kinda obsolete. but with those buffed battlecruisers so will become long-ranged hacs, too. or something else.then ccp will finally admit the balance is completely broken and obsolete classes need buffing. so they buff those and your beloved battlecruisers end up getting the very same (relative) position where they could have belonged to long before that.is it really what you want? 5 minutes of fame for few ships at the cost of justice, dev time etc?"
5/10/2011,"^ i believe the term is ""power creep"", and yeah it does need to be avoided, especially with a ship size as delicate balance-wise as bcs. the thing that made me realise there might be an issue was when i was shopping around for some new throwaway pvp ships, and honestly couldn't justify a cruiser to myself. cost of fitting the things is almost as much as a bc, but their performance is so much lower. not sure if i mentioned this in another post (sorry if i did) - but me and a friend added up costs in the region we were in.a shield buffered cyclone was approx. 4mil more than a fully fitted rupture, factoring insurance."
5/10/2011,"which is why most are talking about a buff+nerf, to let the bcs meet half-way .. individual bonuses is more than enough to differentiate them (easy when there are only two).benefit of such a balanced approach is that the power-creep in minimized and it should give a little more breathing room for 'lesser' ships .. especially if combined with a bc price increase to better represent their 'power'."

5/10/2011,how is the abaddon not attracting nerf threads anyway? i have no particular view on the subject but stat-wise it seems to be in a league of its own compared to other battleships.
5/10/2011,"because it is pretty well balanced when you think about it, just scales horribly well as does all things and works exceedingly well with proper support (read: guardians) .. it is the same for most amarr hulls actually, mediocre solo/small-gang but pure awesome in numbers."
5/10/2011,caldari missile ships need to have then kinetic missile bonus replaced
5/10/2011,"""fix"" for what? remember that suicide ganking is intended gameplay. ccp have explicitly confirmed this on several occasions."
5/10/2011,"i like the idea of using hacking modules, anything that implies a breaking of secured computers should be more then just a pve container key.so here's my idea, building on the ideas of others earlier.add an sbu like object to the game that disrupts services in the target system, but it has no hp. it needs to be hacked to disable it, and it's vulnerable to being hacked for a period of time between being anchored and going online. the period of time is determined by how much of a disruption the attackers want it to have, meaning it's configurable. and as soon as it's anchored it has the intended effect, so even if it gets hacked 10 minutes later, it still disrupted things.if you want the, i'm going to call it an siu for service interruption unit, to disable all rats/anoms/sigs for 1 hour, it's vulnerable for, say, 15 minutes. because who really cares if ratting isn't available for an hour? but if you want it to disable ratting for a week, well now it's vulnerable for a couple hours.other things it could do are (off the top of my head): - prevent docking at the station (high cost to siu vulnerability duration) - jam all mining lasers in the system - jam all moon miners in the system - turn off local - disable jump bridges in system - turn on a market tax in the outpost in system (if there is one) that filters money into the invader's corp wallet - use your imagination.there'd probably need to be some amount of limiting so that every single effect couldn't be turned on all at once and/or for the maximum duration. also, please keep whoever designed the ui for poss far away from this. it would need to be used quickly, and possibly in a combat environment.finally, the siu should be 6000m3, so it can be hauled in a blockade runner, but no more then 1 at a time (per cloaky hauler)."
5/10/2011,"wouldn't that be considered the cost of bloat empires? consider how long it takes <insert federal acronym here> to respond to <insert tragedy here> off the main roads out in the sticks .. hell it is often a problem if a tragedy happens next door to response unit hq due to all the youtube *****s with videophones needing to be smacked around first there is absolutely nothing in the way of guerilla options at present and since any such option will have a massive impact on the 'set in their ways' (read: cannot/will not adapt) null who make up the majority, ccp will have to endure a lot of crap to make it happen .. in short: your 'blob > all' lifestyle is safe for a long time, don't worry."
5/10/2011,"so you want to be able to do damage deserving of a serious response without actually risking any of your own assets, sounds fair to me.its irrelevant what size of entity you're attacking. in fact a larger alliance will probably have a higher chance of responding with a 10 minute warning than a smaller one. the overall chance of winning is still basically zero.i'm all for having something like an anchorable which shuts down services in a constellation, or even region if you want (although not docking, thats not going to encourage fights at all) as long as you can defend it. i'd also be quite happy for a 10 minute hack to disable services so long as they could be restored with a similar amount of effort.damage should be proportional to the effort the attacker puts in, regardless of how much more the attacker feels their sense of self-superiority entitles them too."
5/10/2011,"i'm not convinced hacking the main two ihub upgrades is really the path to take. the presence of your gang in system is already affecting the 'farming' of the mining sites and rat sites. what does that leave?as i suggested earlier in the thread have new structures to attack and link the sov pos fuel discount to them. old bonus, new mechanic. new vulnerability.there could even a small strategic aspect to this if pos stront usage is able to be messed with along with the other fuels...if they were ever made to work properly and be desirable (or have they already?) the wormhole and ded site upgrades could be made vulnerable to some kind of interference. the way they work means the simple presence of a roaming gang doesn't make them useless - chance based of spawn over time vs constant anom respawn."
5/10/2011,i agree but if you need an hour to hack a the ihub you will get dropped by a blobi would say that the hacking is halted the moment 1 uncloaked ship (no noobship/shuttle) is on grid (something like within 300k of the structure)that means that you can send in some huge buffered ship to get more time for the rest of the fleet
5/10/2011,"tie actual production in the system to the industrial index.if i produce rifters in any facility, the index goes up a teensy bit. if i build a supercapital, the index goes up a huge amount.link the ability to anchor certain structures directly to the index. scrap sovereignty ""levels"". the tcu goes online and sticks your name in the top right corner when the military index exceeds 1."
5/10/2011,"to give you some credit, this is the most transparant ""alliances should feed me easy killmails whenever i'm in their space"" i've ever seen."
5/10/2011,"depends which metric you use: geographical size, # on 'show info' or actual active players (not characters).the ebb and flow of eve sees numbers change dramatically while size can remain relatively static due to the ehp based blob friendly sovereignty system that favours defenders through jamming, bridges, reships et al.efforts involved should be proportional, that much we agree on. question is how to get the idea of disruption by guerilla warfare through the threadnaughts that are bound to crop up if it is even considered by ccp .. they have a nasty tendency to cave in when the emo's start rampaging.one could make all ihub upgrades vulnerable with a built in 4hr auto-repair cycle (add manual repair to cut it way down).could make it a costly affair to just pos/dock up when a roam comes around without impacting tz xenophobes too harshly.at this point i'll settle for anything that doesn't involve 'lol hot-drop' as the solution to everything from defence to killing ratters"
5/10/2011,"not really, at the 10 minute mark none of it matters. unless the system owners are pre-warned you'll be in and out before any meaningful response happens.see this i could actually get behind, even without the auto-repair (but not without the manual option). i'd even go as far as to say ihub upgrades aren't really enough damage.the trouble is it still doesn't incentivise people to actually come fight. people are pushing for longer lasting, unrepairable damage as the solution to that but effects that persist hours after the gang has left remove far too much risk from the equation for the attacker. instead i'd argue for more severe and widespread disruption for gangs that are willing to commit. if the sanshas can apply constellation wide reductions to player resists, damage and income, why not have a range of siege-like modules that do similar things (you could even stick the mods in the incursion lp store for added roleplaying). give it a 1-2 minute cycle , make it aggress and immobilize the ship, even throw up a beacon if needed, then you'll get your fights."
5/10/2011,"even if the upgrade hit was a strategic one? imagine if csaa's were offlined for the duration (ie. a 3rd state), or bridges only allowed travel in or out of affected system, or jammers allowed titan bridging but not capital jumps (ie. with cyno/capital revamp), or ... you get the idea (i hope ).damage from ihub disruption in 'random system x' is negligible but in important systems it could/should be devastating .. just as an attack on a metropolitan area has greater impact than a fire on some farm in the country."
5/10/2011,"i was more implying that knocking out ihub upgrades as they stand right now isn't really very much inconvenience (again, assuming they can be repped).if you're discussing offlining csaas then you've strayed back into the realms of attacks that should merit a full alliance response without allowing one to take place. and knocking out jump bridges can be done as is anyway (plus if you're looking for a good fight, you shouldn't be preventing people from bringing one).the problem with something like destroying an ihub upgrade having lasting effects is that the definition of a reasonable response time changes depending on both the attacker and the defender. you can't balance a high-skillpoint, high isk value fleet incapping an ihub upgrade without making it impossible for everyone else. and likewise you can't balance it for a more reasonable gang without making it impossible to defend against the ~elitepvp~ gang."
5/10/2011,"disclaimer: i don't live in nullsec, i have no idea what i'm talking about, disregard, etc.... so like.what if tritanium was exclusively found in nullsec?"
5/10/2011,"ok we can work out timer length later on. but from what i have been reading people want something that encourages the attacker to field a moderate sized gang, something large enough to defeat one alliance's home defense fleet, but the event doesn't inherently encourage blobbing (other than what's needed to defeat the home defense fleet). so for example hacking a structure always goes at the same rate no matter how big your blob is, while shooting at something with a lot of hp (like a pos) depends entirely on how much dps your blob can put out.part of encouraging the attacker to only field a medium sized gang is to make the reward for completing the event to only be worth it for a moderate sized gang. so the penalty to the defenders needs to only last a little while. something that is worth it for a small gang to try but not worth calling a cta for.then for the defenders the response time needs to be long enough that one alliance can mount a home defense fleet. but not long enough for them to get a huge blob from whatever power block they are part of.also the penalty for the defenders needs to be short enough to only penalize the people who were around when it happened and not people who logged on later on (since there are no reinforcement timers tied to the event). this also fixes the time zone problem. if one dude in a rifter hacks the i-hub at 3 am when nobody is on, the penalty should only last long enough to effect the handfull of people on at the time who couldn't be bothered to blow up one rifter."
5/10/2011,"okay, i've been sitting here mulling over my random brainfart above.it is my extremely limited understanding as a highsec carebear that the basic sense of balance is this:in highsec, you're safe and protected, and the primary industries are in mass produced base stuff.in nullsec, you're unprotected, and the primary industries are esoteric rare stuff.what if it were the other way around?when i think of ""farms and fields"", i think of the typical way that such things worked in history. you have the cities where everybody meets and trades and a lot of the more advanced industries operate. then on the outskirts you have the farms and the mines and what have you; the dirty industries. the places where they gather basic resources and produce the stuff you need to survive. the farms fuel the cities.in eve, it's pretty much the reverse of this. there are esoteric things you can only get through ""dangerous places"", but what's the main ingredient that goes into everything? tritanium, right? it's everywhere. it's also used massively in absolutely everything. but let's suppose, just for a second, that we threw the entire economy on its ass.what if mineral availability was effectively reversed? this is as much a thought experiment as a serious proposal; in highsec you have your small mineral fields of megacyte and morphite and what have you. on the edges of highsec you start running into noxcium. around lowsec, you're hitting stuff like mexallon and isogen. then as you keep going further you start hitting sparse pyerite deposits. then you get to nullsec. and what do you find there?tritanium. lots and lots of tritanium. and loads of the other minerals too, but mainly, loads and loads of tritanium. extend this inverse rarity principle to other resources and try to picture what would happen.theoretically what would happen is that you'd start seeing mass low end production, not in the safety of highsec, but in nullsec. living in high security space would be safe and expensive. living in nullsec would be cheap and easy... besides the lawlessness.of course there's tons of **** that gets screwed up with all this, like npc rats and what have you.. but ultimately, as a fulltime highsec carebear, i can tell you that the biggest draw of highsec is simply that it's safe. it's safe, it's easy, it's relaxing, and it's fairly profitable. this probably shouldn't be. living in highsec should be expensive. ships should cost more. modules should cost more. everything should cost more, because that's the price of safety.all this is really just a thought experiment. i wouldn't put it forward as a serious proposal, simply because i know nothing about the practicalities of nullsec. also, i haven't read the thread at all, so for all i know this is already all being discussed. or maybe it's just stupid, i don't know.anyway, yeah. looking forward to the summit notes."
5/10/2011,"yes, but you can balance this for precisely one combination of attacker and defender on precisely one occasion. ask most of the people in this thread and their fleet size will be roughly what they regularly field, and the response time will be just under what it takes their targets to form a fleet that can beat them. wider ranging and more severe active disruption is far better than local, persistant damage unless all you want to do is hurt an entity and leave before it can respond."
5/10/2011,"between freighters and jump bridges, it just isn't cost effective to mine low end minerals locally for most 0.0 entities.being surrounded by friendlies only further adds to the effect. if a more rigid sovereignty system was adopted, forcing sovereignty to be linked directly to adjacent space, hostile wars would be easier to manage and 0.0 alliances would be less inclined to be friends just because they are neighbors.i will now direct you to sovereignty 2.0... in my own words: linkagedoes that need to be modified and updated? certainly. eve was very different back in 2005. but the solution is the big picture, not just the individual brush strokes."
5/10/2011,"before freighters and jump bridges almost all ships were built in empire and we flew them out to 0.0 one by one. it has never been cost effective to mine low ends in 0.0 because you can mine high ends instead and convert them into isk which you can then use to buy ships. most of the low ends that aren't flown in come from reprocessed rat loot. being surrounded by friendlies has nothing to do with it.it isn't too easy to source stuff from empire, its way too hard to produce it locally."
5/10/2011,excellent proposal
5/10/2011,"this is actually quite true. the noob ships as they are leave a lot to be desired, and generally don't go much beyond the first days experience, while being something we are forced to have well after that. every time we pod into a station where we have no ships in the hangar, or one way or another, achieve the same end result through being podded or otherwise.amongst the new player experiences, should be an attractive, sleak vessel which will prove of use and appeal throughout the game, even years later.i would suggest:sleak and designed similar to a space superiority fighter with transport capability, barely larger than a shuttle and much more capable. possibly even a bit like a dropship, and appearing capable of atmospheric flight. add some cool vectored thrust and afterburners such as would be seen on a vtol craft, that are unused in space, for effect. take that last or leave it, as it's not really neccessary and/or may give the wrong impression. still, might be cool.spec:high: 2 mid: 2 low: 2 powergrid: 12 mw cpu: 70 tf callibration: 100 upgrade hardpoints: 1 launcher hardpoints: 1 turret hardpoints: 2max. velocity: 400 m/s inertia modifier: 3.94 mass: 1,820,000 kg volume: 14500 m3 cargo capacity: 164 m3 structure: 253armor: 116 em: 50% thermal: 35% kinetic: 35% explosive: 10%shield: 182 em: 0% thermal: 20% kinetic: 40% explosive: 50%capacitor capacity: 310 gj recharge time: 215400 smax. targeting range: 17.6 km max. locked targets: 4 sensor strength: 4 points signature radius: 27 m scan resolution: 367 mmrequired skills: spaceship command iremove the auto-replacement feature, and replace it with ship claimable through esc menu."
5/10/2011,"the issue:over the years, the corp role system has become increasingly antiquated.at it's inception, it was designed around fairly resource-poor corporations with 10-50 members and 1-3 offices. even at that time, the roles were a bit too sweeping, but we've always made it work.in modern day eve, when corporations and alliances can have a dozen offices and hundreds of billions in assets, it is far, far too wide a scope.currently, there are certain roles which are carte blanche.contracts: allowing someone to make one contract on behalf of the corporation means they can delete any outstanding corporate contractsdelivery hangars: unlike corp hangars, there is no per-station control. access to one means access to all.science/industry jobs: like delivery hangar, there is no location restriction. if someone wants to build some ammo for the corp, you have to trust them not to cancel the titan build 57 jumps away that they didn't even know about.wallet journal: currently, to allow someone access to view the wallet journal, you also have to allow access to delivery hangars. equally, granting any type of view role means showing the current contents of all wallet divisions.corp hangars: the current system is based on 3 choices. ""headquarters"" ""based at"" and ""everything else in the entire universe"" - need to give someone pos hangar access? you also have to give them access to every hangar everywhere that isn't the hq or their based at location.pos access in general: giving any type of access to one pos means the same type of access to every pos.the fixes:granularity.contracts - ""can create"" and ""can modify"" roles. ""modify"" can even be broken down to ""created from wallet div x"" - but even without that change, just a ""can modify"" flag would eliminate 90% of the problem.delivery hangars - at the least, enable the same flags as currently in place for offices. ideally, the flags as suggested below for office role reform.science and industry - the same as contracts. can install, can cancel. cancel can be broken down to ""installed from location x"" for further granularity.wallet journal: the same as hangar roles. ""view"" and ""take"" roles, per division.corp hangars: there is no issue with assigning a contract or market order to a specific station. why not expand hangar roles in the same way? allow roles to be set on a per-station basis. ideally, the above science and industry roles would fall into this as well.pos access: if not possible to assign roles through the corp interface for a specific pos, then at least make it possible from the pos equipment itself. an ""allowed"" list, rather than an access role.overall, these seem to be fairly low-hanging fruit from an outsiders perspective. yet any one of them alone would represent a massive change in the ability for larger scaled operations to function in a more decentralized way.roles, as they stand now, remove the ability for any significant asset usage delegation, as the trust must be nearly-all or none. it provides no opportunity for newer players to work their way upward in their corporate responsibilities in regards to corporate assets. with these changes, the importance of trust in eve is no less important - but the ability to place a more finely tuned value on that trust becomes far more possible."
5/10/2011,"+1.being able to have station-based roles for things like security officer and whatnot would be really cool but slightly unncessary, but i agree that for things like hangar access it'd be nice to not have to rely on basing someone somewhere and limiting t"

5/10/2011,"since canflippers act in gangs -mostly- there should be equal rights for all. there are few approaches to this:1) every pilot with an agressive mod on their ship from the flipping players corp will get aggro towards your corp and your gang. (this could also be reduced to a range of 32au (oh exploitable) to 3 jumps out)2) you can fight back with less risk. (his corp mates cannot interfere, nor do you get a timer for their whole corp)3) expand the aggro timer for the canflipper, that guy stole your stuff. maybe even get killrights.4) protection rights for dedicated mercenary corps. this would give a corp or member the option to take care of the ones they love, without the need of a wardec.either way, players should feel more responsibility when making a quick steal or try to be a pain in the ass. i'm just sayin'.also would this add more need for a slightly better balance of players within corps, people would ""work"" more together, and for those who want to see the world burn, they get all the heat they need.other changes to the game mechanics should be done aswell, if someone in a fleet agresses a player, all gang members should get a limited aggro timer just for the heck of less concordokken exploitation.edit: did i mention my idea of having an extra window to see who you can kill? oh well, there we go =)and while we're at it, another extra window to see where the players are you have killrights on, that would be nice."

5/10/2011,"1. economic viability and pain in the ass r pretty much one and the same here. and if it's a pain in the ass and not viable on its own, then it should die out. look at low sec: farmed to extinction (pain in the ass to do anything non-pvp-wise so not economically viable) and yet the remaining -10s can't sustain themselves either without high sec alts.2. where's this ""fun""? since u'd rather waste all that time camping a gate all day or avoiding targets u might risk losing to instead of spending the time ratting the sec back up and generating a little income to help sustain what u do, u pretty much brought that on yourself; and as a result of that, not only is low sec deserted but the -10s have to desert as well sooner or later because they don't want to make the effort to generate more income via ratting, something they'll have to end up doing anyway. pretty self-defeating.3. if it's so ""insulting"" to u, then try to think outside your perspective for once and maybe u won't be ""insulted"". my proposal just encourages u to rat back up above -5 to give the prey more breathing room to actually do something in low sec, no more, no less. if u're too lazy to do even that, go to 0.0 or learn to sustain yourself without hiding behind an alt in high sec.this is the basis for what u feel to be ""insults"": because once again, it's only from your flawed, myopic and selfish point of view, not anyone else's. try to look at this from someone else's eyes or the big picture for once. if low sec is less griefing than high sec then why is it so deserted, even by -10s who have to go back to their high sec alts sooner or later? because the lack of concord and ppl's reaction to that only reinforces that low sec would grief more and *gasp* that's why the -10s hide behind their high sec alts in the first place. derp. so how is high sec any more griefing when u choose to hide behind high sec alts under concord just to sustain yourself? it all depends on whether u're killmail-whoring or hiding behind your high sec alt at the time. do u get it now because a strawman is nothing compared to your own flawed, myopic and selfish point of view. oh and if u feel u got ""insulted"" again, wise up or deal with it."
5/10/2011,"translation: ""these r my numbers and u can't question me 'cause i said so."" it's u who doesn't understand that anyone can pull numbers out of their ass, not just u, so thx for that sorry excuse that u call ""trying"". but hey, while u're at it, why don't u go back to whining some more about how the proposal ""griefs"" the hell out of u 'cause u can't handle consequences? after all, that is what this thread is about or did u go off on your own tangent 'cause u made yourself look even worse whining about it? so plz continue."
5/10/2011,"i think what he was referring to was that empire still has the big risks (arbitrary wardecs by anybody) but doesn't have the great rewards (mining veldspar isn't exactly great isk/hr)lol. players with 50m skillpoint toons wardeccing a startup empire mining corp with 10m skillpoints between them to feel big (and for lols) is hardly a ""player social conflict"". aside from the likes of privatears and 0phanage who predominantly wardec nullsec alliances, there are so many wardecs by long term players on new players for no better reason than wanting some easy cannon fodder to shoot.i'm all for players being able to resolve conflicts without contrived game mechanics getting in the way, but as mentioned before wardecs are contrived game mechanics themselves.if you want pvp, go to low/nullsec or join fw or rvb. if you have some beef with some empire based corp then perhaps a wardec is an appropriate outlet but currently no reason is required to declare war, all you need is to get your corp shareholders to agree to it.having said that, i don't think isk amounts will change anything, so not supporting this topic. requiring the addition of terms of surrender might (isk, items, leaving a system etc)"
5/10/2011,"can i just throw int he idea that players can not leave a corp for the first week of a war so that the people we actually want to kill dont just leave before the 24 hour notification time is up. so if a war ends after a week, then so be it, they are still there but i think more corp ceo's get ****ed of the fact that as soon as that dec mail comes throuhg 75% of there corp leaves just couse there could be a bit of pew pew,if you join a corp, be expected to help out when times are rough."
5/10/2011,"/agreewhat about the merc grieffers corp using isk given by the contractual corp? 20m first week then increase by 100% 2nd week, 200% 3rd week and next ones 500%. small grieffers couldn't stand the rithm while real big alliances wars yes.by the way what's the point of wardecc a 2 men corp for ever? -unless grieffers are just stupid, and unfortunately there are too many in this game... destroying ships is the purpose of the game every one and his mother are aware of that, but sustain vicious acts with simple game mechanics is bad for every one. has neutral repp."
5/10/2011,"can you please, explain to me the definition of a ""greifer"" within the context of this game."
5/10/2011,"quoted for truth. all types of player interaction is ccp's goal, thus war dec's won't change, albeit a surrender terms option like what jerika posted would be a good idea. btw, it's also cheap because it's too damn easy to just leave a corp... and decced corps disband laughing w/o any ill affects on them, saying ""u just wasted (whatever wannabe price hike wardec). the low cost allows for less war evassion to a new corp. to be fair, any corp in a war should be locked... nobody in or out. the 24hrs after notification is for your preperation only. you want out? time to negotiate a surrender... again loke jerika posted (page 1). i would add though, to apease you balance claimers... the initiator pays a war dec cost, per how much isk damage they would be satisfied to inflict. i.e. a 2 mil wardec allows you to inflict 500 mil isk damage per avg market value. a 10 mil wardec allows 2.5 bil etc etc. not saying that's a solution, just a thought, yet better contrived than the drivel ""balance"" that the 40yr old virgin carebears singing ""i want an oscar meyer weiner"" have come up with thus far, in a sad attempt to escape pvp altogether. true story: corp a has an internal dispute. some members split to form corp b. corp b viciously decs corp a, but corp a knows a good merc corp. merc corp decs corp b and deals them heavy casualties. corp b retracts war on corp a. corp b having ruined their ties with corp a and continue to get hit by merc corp, disband. corp a, very happy with mercs and establish commerce with them. mercs happy to get good deals, get paid and had some fun.in carebear dreamland, this kind of exciting social interaction wouldn't happen."
5/10/2011,"warp navigation doesn't have to be realistic, as this happens to be a science-fiction oriented game in space.realistic idea? what isn't realistic about using scanning technology to direct a probe to a point in space, and deploy it as a warpable beacon. you warp to beacons in missions? in anomalies? well, this isn't really that different, and may be considered a covert beacon in that it broadcasts a signature only usable by a limited number of people. it isn't really that hard to grasp."
5/10/2011,"i think this is a good idea.even if you were to make it so that interbus actually did something, such as offer haulers missions hauling passengers. that would be an improvement. currently you can buy passengers such as tourists, strippers, freed slaves, etc. and sell them in another station at a greater cost. this is hardly a passenger service, more like a slave market. another option might be to make it so that a hauler can take on passengers in addition to their freight, so they don't have to ever fly with an empty or partly filled cargo hold. in this case npc interbus passengers would pay you, just like a hauling mission. you might not get paid until you drop them off at their final destination, or half up front, etc. transporting players as passengers? hmm. i suppose this could be done as transporting clones. there is an option in the game for transporting clones, which happens at the press of a button. i just assumed that this meant there was a clone bank of blank clones, and moving your clone meant switching the location where your mind was uploaded into the blank. this would mean that it's possible to upload your mind into the blank of any clone, just as you can check your e-mail from any computer with an online connection. it might be possible to move a player's jump clone with a courier contract."
5/10/2011,"yep, exactly. why not? i'm sure there are cases where you don't want to lose your implants and hardwires.well you may need to move an expensive med clone across to null sec, or you really can't be bothered to autopilot yourself across the universe before a rl vacation, and you would like to pay someone to just move you so that the next time you log in you will be there. also, if there are options of this kind of transport, then more players can be 'pure' traders or pi or business professions, without having to learn to pilot a ship that can survive the journey to get them to low or null sec. it opens up access to different professions in the economy, while at the same time gives haulers a new income stream (or a income stream)"
5/10/2011,"yep, that's exactly what i was thinking (in terms of the npc passenger market side of it) and if the ferry records of all haulers were public, there will be competition among haulers to have the best passenger transport record, in order to get more lucrative vip passenger contracts. it basically makes hauling a complete profession, right up there with mining, ratting, and pvp pirating."
5/10/2011,"i was thinking professions like traders, who only need to be in station or move around to maintain orders, or logistics managers -- making out courier contracts for a 0.0 corp and paying out to the delivers. in fact any ""business only"" professions (corp management or planet interaction)."
5/10/2011,lol true. thanks for the feedback.
5/10/2011,"so, can the passenger self destruct his pod to escape the 'capture' by the pirates or not? if not, here's the scenario:1. you get captured.2. you can't clone jump away.3. you can't self destruct. 4. pirate sets ransom to 100 billion.5. you don't have 100 billion.6. stuck forever."
5/10/2011,"excellent proposal.needs adjustments has we can see in the counter arguments but the initial idea is just awesome, adds new stuff/opportunities and most important, different game play opportunity = better game"
5/10/2011,"as much as i despise the big power blocs dominating the csm, particularly goons, i'm not surprised it happened. welcome to politics: you win because you are more popular. you have more votes. how good of a delegate you will be, how seriously you take the csm and how good your ideas are don't matter. it's the same in the real world.democracy is the worst form of government, except all the others that have been tried. there really is no fair way to improve csm delegate selection, so we get what we get. i voted for candidates that had no chance of winning, i wouldn't change my vote if i could. these candidates that have no chance of winning though, they could try to rally the same type of large bloc support as the goons do... you will need that to win."
5/10/2011,"while i agree with you on popularity being the primary contributing factor to election results in a democratic form of government, i have to say everything indicates the mittani and current csm is doing what it should. even if the did scam their way innot saying it's right for them to do that, but, (this once), it is funny."
5/10/2011,"makes me less likely to mission run in the future. i just bought and trained them all to level 4 about a month ago, to give some purpose to mission running. just another nerf."
5/10/2011,"having fully read the thread, it seems missions may improve despite the loss of the skills and lp bonuses, yet i will reserve judgement untill i see it in effect. so long as we get the sp back, i don't really mind as i'll just drop it somewhere else. long run, makes everything equal, and less skill training, or skill cross-training required for all. that's a plus."
5/10/2011,tbh i don't understand how this change would actually lower mission runners income. surly a drop in lp per mission by 33% would just lead to an increase of lp value by 50% as there is 33% less lp to go around :p alas though your mission running income is still the same.........the only real affect i can see coming from this is an increase in price on lp faction gear ...... oooo market speculation buy now while its cheap !!!!
5/10/2011,"you are correct that it will increase lp value (theoretically) but there are a few scaling problems. first of all, lvl4's will not have any noticable change in payout, lvl5's will however. the reason is because lvl4's pay almost exclusively in isk with a tiny amount of lp given out, lvl5's are the opposite. it would be like a 18% bounty/loot/reward nerf for all the lvl4 runners while leaving lp alone.edit: forgot to mention, it also removes 4 items from the lp store. yes, those military connection skillbooks and such come from the lp stores. so even with the reduced lp, it may not actually increase lp value. implants come primarily from lvl4 story lines and with those skillbooks soon to be gone, that leaves us with spec books, ammo and maybe 1-2 worthwhile modules for each faction. ships are produced mostly from fw lp as they get a huge discount and thus can undercut everyone else without flinching. i know from personal experience, i was fw for 1.5 years ."
5/10/2011,"just a quick note to the mathematically challenged:if lp numbers per mission are nerfed, the average value of lp will rise. depending on the elasticity of demand, this counter effect will wholly or partially mitigate the income reduction.eg: ccp change agent quality and social skills, resulting in an overall 17% reduction in lp. consequently, the effective value of those lp rise by (for example) 11%. the reduction in the mr's lp income will actually be 1-(0.83*1.11)= 7.787%, not 17%obviousl those are made up example numbers, but i suspect that they wouldn't be all that far out. i am sceptical that a 7-8% reduction in the lp component of the mission runners rewards would be enough to completely obviate lo-sec/0.0 mission running, given the very high rewards currently obtainable. it's certainly a much lesser nerf than the one recently endured by anomaly ratters."
5/10/2011,this will certainly be interesting. it'll kill the compensation of lp you get from missioning in a higher sec compared to a lower sec.hopefully this and the agent division changes will spread people out more.
5/10/2011,"that is the other side of it, with agent quality and divisions largely removed, all agents are now equal assuming same system sec. it is of no impact to lvl5 runners as all lvl5's are currently q12 but it does make all those lvl4 q-20 agents scattered around suddenly perfectly good options. so in all honesty this could be a buff to lvl4 runners as it will open up agents in better locations that were unused due to their low quality. but no matter how you slice it, it's still an unnecessary nerf to lvl5's. this is assuming the lp skills are truly removed. from the looks of it they may actually still function. i think it's too early to judge exactly what ccp is up to, it may be that they are compacting agents into just 2 classes, combat and non-combat and the lp skills simply haven't been updated yet."
5/10/2011,"if the main target is that only a few ones can fly super capsif the main target is that regular players spending just a few hours ig can't make 100m in a single evening (3 to 4 hours)if the main target is that every one fly frigates and cruisers because they can' afford bigger than thatyour goal is being achieved.but i can't see how this changes something for all those big corps/alliances sitting on trillions.i'm making my break of eve, just connecting to set skills que and some times move some pi. tired of broken stuff ships/weapons, of game mechanics, nerfs affecting more my wallet since i can't harvest moons and pushing me to do more boring stuff than i was already doing. thx for all this, i'm re discovering that even free to play fps's are more dynamic and rewarding"
5/10/2011,can someone from the csm plz comment on the csm's position on this horrible change....0.0 seems to be getting worse by the patch.... less anoms... now less jump bridges... whats next...
5/10/2011,source of this change?
5/10/2011,ccp is making changes to gather tears from those who think null sec should not require :effort:. op success!
5/10/2011,"vincentthere was a time when 0.0 had no anomolies and no jump bridges.imo those were better days, people actually worked for their space.bitter vet here supporting the jump bridge nerf!"
5/10/2011,"ok so lets think of what would actually change if jump bridges went away.1. it'd be harder to ship in everything from jita which would force people to actually mine and manufacture in their space. honestly i don't like how the majority of the materials that are used in null are harvested under the protective blanket of concord.2. i'd be harder to defend an empire. ok so imagine you are shooting at an empire that is 30 jumps from end to end. your fleet has to go 20 jumps to go shoot at whatever target you are going after, (maybe you are sieging a pos or something) the defenders on the other hand just have to ride their jump bridge network 5 jumps or so to cut you off.3. there would be no safe jumps. imagine you are in a hauler in one 0.0 system and you want to get to another 0.0 system, fortunately for you there is a jump bridge chain in place. you undock from you station and head to a pos with a jump bridge on it. you then jump through to another pos full of turrets then warp directly to another defended pos and another jump bridge. if the chain is set up right you can warp to and from death star poses and never have to risk running into a gate camp or roaming gang. (by the way this is how i got in and out of fountain for 3 months)4. renters and pets would be less viable. right now if you are a renter or pet of a bigger power block if anybody heads into your space and disrupts your carebearing all you have to do is scream into an intel channel till your overlords send a ""rent a home defense"" fleet through the jump bridge network.so yeah i love nullsec but hate jump bridges."
5/10/2011,"many people conflate ""easier"" with better"". the jb changes - and they're a small change - make living in highly developed sov space a tiny bit more challenging.the hysterical complaints that being forced to use a gate or two to cross a region will destroy sov 0.0 leave the inhabitants of lo-sec, npc 0.0, w-space and even empire (wardecs, dontchaknow?) bemused and baffled.we can manage it - why can't you?"
5/10/2011,"if wormhole inhabitants can manage to regularly fuel their stations, i think you guys can manage a couple extra jumpgates.supporting the change. +1"
5/10/2011,"there were also, what, one quarter as many people in 0.0 as now?"
5/10/2011,"coraline... you wouldn't mind if i fleshed out your idea into a new item for purchase via shady industrialists. it woulduse existing game mechanics, designed for a variety of ships and provide a similar situation to your following post aboutexploding surprises. give me a day and mr.x will design you a tft construct detonator! remember that the evilengineer creating this must remain anonymous and a fee of several billion isk for the first bpo must be in my account beforedelivery. only in the safety of a random wh can this transaction take place. concord can never suspect this device exists!end of transmission..."
5/10/2011,forgive me if this has been brought up. i couldn't find much reference on eve-search other then this thread from '09
5/10/2011,quoting this to thank ccp regarding the recent dev blob. for anyone that has not seen it.linkage
5/10/2011,"i don't fly a wolf and i also do not like jump bridges. they make it too easy to blob people, too easy to set up pet alliances, and too easy to avoid gates by warping from one pos to another."

5/10/2011,"after 3 month of eve playtime, any player in a npc corp automatically joins the fw militia.problem solved."
5/10/2011,"yes, the best way to loose more fresh people playing the game.can you figure out since the very first day all rookies have the right to is to be suicide ganked, can flip games from older players, ganked by concord because of game mechanics exploit from older players, scammed and a lot more of juicy stuff.yes force them to be the baits of all those deviants over present in the game, it's the best way to add new targets in long term..."
5/10/2011,as long as those people are making 1-2man corps that can then be properly war-deced and griefed like the holy ccp intended...working as intended
5/10/2011,"swynet, my main beef is with old players that hidde in npc corporations to prevent wardecs.3 month old players are not ""fresh people"". its more then enough time to learn the basic game mechanics and start/get into a player corporation.also you only listed the fun stuff, new players stop playing eve becouse they get bored of the solo ""carebear"" playstyle, leaving eve without having played ""eve"", its sad...so the sonner new players start playing this game, the better."
5/10/2011,"vaju,the thing is that we play in a sandbox, you can choose to pvp or pve and no one should be obliged to do this or that.i do agree now, after all my ig experiences that a 3 months player can perfectly get in the game's mood but at one condition:that the player corp where he's getting in assume his implants and ships losses for a yearyou know has well has i do how hard is for a newb to get some isk, how hard is for him to evolve in missions and get the good standing to do better missions since the skill gain is not proportional to his investment in the game but to something linear unchangeable no matter what he does, meaning that maybe he's able to do better missions but he can't because he's not skilled enough.now, he can pvp, i'm ok with that but what does pvp means to him? -losses: implants he hardly can get+sp loss+ships he can hardly buy/fit and when he looses them what we expect him to do? -spam local begging isk? in my humble opinion the whole way the rookie gets introduced in to the game is screwed by older players more than the game it self even if improvements are needed, and most of players corps recruiting newbs ask more than they offer to them.this is my point, this is what i would like to see changed and for that, the whole players corps system has is today must be revamped.also some proposals here are excellent."
5/10/2011,all that needed done was to treat pilots in npc corps as employees of those corps in that they do not get to choose missions but are instead are given missions/jobs/tasks to do or face losing standings rapidly. they are essentially employees and should be treated as such.
5/10/2011,"supported, replace the velocity bonus for an agility bonus."
5/10/2011,"supported. reward those flying their freighter, instead of the autopilot masses.though, as jf already have 5% agility per skill level for one of their bonuses, it would likely have to be something smaller, like 3%."
5/10/2011,"not convinced as yet. although i'm a hauler and welcome any change which makes my life easier, i value the play balance of the game and the economy of eve as a whole more, so can you support why you think that freighter pilots need this benefit? are there other ship type bonuses which seem ill conceived? (for instance, i always thought that having a 5% bonus for every level of racial industrial skill seems funny for a transport ship, as you need indy 5 to fly it anyway.)"
5/10/2011,thanks! silly me.
5/10/2011,i like this proposal.i also really like the corruption expansion proposal from a few years ago by someone you might recognize
5/10/2011,:di like
5/10/2011,"i do not support botting.one of the miners suggested that ccp should not ban the botters, but if they suspect you to be a bot, you have 10 min to respond to a bot request and then you go red and anyone can safely kill you.i like this idea as botting is cheating period. however, i do not support the idea of 10 min - perhaps 20 or 30 maybe even an hour. i've been afk for that long and sometimes longer so i don't agree with the 10 min.just a thought."
5/10/2011,"but it makes isk easier to produce for everyone else, thus the market share of rmt'ers is vastly reduced when there is no need to buy isk when you can print it yourself. not that i agree with this proposal, but yeah, giving the green light to botting would effectively destroy the rmt market."
5/10/2011,so make copying bookmarks like copying blueprints?
5/10/2011,"yes, in some ways. you can get it started, then go afk; you don't have to develop carpal tunnel syndrome to copy large numbers of bookmarks. the rate would be throttled so that it doesn't lag out the solar system.however, you shouldn't need skills or a science & industry slot to copy bookmarks (like you do need for copying blueprints)."
5/10/2011,re: jita - you don't know thatre: gates - what about camps where people are just chillin?re: safety - don't pretend this is some sort of altruistic proposalre: afk cloakers - nice tryall in all...no.
5/10/2011,"um, no.macro mining and bots ruin the game, period.this will never happen, and if it does, you'll see a large player base just walk away from the game."
5/10/2011,"as long as i believe that it is possible to get rid of macros - i'll oppose the ""well everyone's gonna do it anyways"" approach.and yes, it's very possible. use more randomly spawning rats that are fairly nasty."
5/10/2011,"ok i guess in theory ccp could make mining less mind numbingly boring, but come on seriously, which of these two options do you think is more likely to happen?"
5/10/2011,"this. ignoring the rest of the idea, don't let players choose their citizenship. base it off of their medical clone or something."
5/10/2011,"true, though even then dreads will still rely solely on the siege module to be effective at anything"
5/10/2011,"dreadnought were used to kill capitals, and were effective. then mother-ships got their boost and dreads are obsolete now.if there is any ship that needs to be examined to fit the role of ""capital killer"" then i would look at the dread first."
5/10/2011,"for the dread to be the cap killer of choice then for it's dps vs capitol ships it has to have a better isk wise bang for your buck than motherships. so if you are going to take down another capitol ship it should be more efficient to buy a pile of dreads than use one mothership, (assuming your dread pile costs the same as the mothership)."
5/11/2011,"excellent point sarina. you know what they say, 90% of people blindly use statistics without actually knowing what they mean"
5/11/2011,"noes !the effective 17%+ dmg you get out of it replaces very well lower dmg missile in another average resistance and nothing, absolutely nothing tells you your dmg is crap if you choose to use thermal/explo/em dmg.dammit, if my ****ing hybrids worked that well than your racial kinetic bonus i wouldn't be spamming all gallente/hybrids threads with my issues encountered using that stuff.get out please"
5/11/2011,they are the only ships in game with a damage bonus to an ammo not a weapon system. it would be like you only get the hybrid bonii if your shooting iron.
5/11/2011,errrm:helios 10% to drone thermal damageeris 5% to thermal missile damageall the bombers are racial damage type bonusedthe kinetic bonus is fine. it's the caldari's damage type. live with iti still think that reducing the range of guided missiles and introducing modules that will increase that range again is the first major step to balance of battlecruisers
5/11/2011,"fixed. it isn't about guided missiles at all, you just want a drake nerf. light missiles are fine and cruises are broken so i'd be rather surprised if you were dimwitted enough to want those nerfed as well.here's a more elegant solution: reduce drake lock range (max skilled) by 20km or so. there, it now has to use a slot of some sort to reach max range. mission accomplished without your moronic idea.oh in fact, while i'm talking about missiles in this thread:reduce flight time and significantly increase velocity, for cruises and to a lesser extent heavies.no weapon (i'm looking at you, cruise missiles) should be relegated to pve for being so utterly useless in pvp."
5/11/2011,"and the last two are the breacher and inquisitor.then you have no problem with changing gallente so the are only bonused on the thermal part of hybrids and thermal drones, caldari the kinetic part of hybrids, armarr the em part of lasers and em drones, and minmatar the explosive part of projetals and explosive missiles.now everyone has racial damage."
5/11/2011,the proletariat did anyway.
5/11/2011,"so 0.0 should be painful to live in for anyone but the super rich elite. which you happen to be one of, because you're elite (obviously)."
5/11/2011,which is what this thread is all about .. some pretty nifty (and some outlandish) ideas already.thread as a whole is worth a read if you haven't done so already.

5/11/2011,"assumptionin modern societies specializing is common and to force an entity not to specialize is retarted because everyone can't focussed on that he is able to do best. the proposition is a failurethe analysis og ccp doesn't start with the goal to get into 0.0 more prodders and miners. it's a idea without a concept. how we get more carebears into 0.0?a. analysisi. according to the game theory no one chooses the maximum profit if the lower profit is more secure. the reason why the carebears aren't producing in 0.0 is, that production in highsec is much cheaper and much more secure. you don't need masses of guards (pvp pilots) and your investment can't be deleted by a random invasion. and every 0.0 allianz is based on, that the assets (bpo) are protected in high sec.ii. the marked in eve is not developed and is based on one big hub. everyone want to have a picture of todays prices and everyone wishes to have a fast access to all types of wares. this is mostly garanteed by the hub jita. as long as the current game mechanism don't provide a better marked access (it's like in the good old socialistic countries) we will get a tendency for a big hub. and 0.0 entitys are based on jita too, because they want to sell minerals and moongoo there and buy modules and ships to a good price. it's a center to exchange wares, like tech against dyspro. and there is demand by all 0.0 corps that are running reactions. iii. ccp wishes more pvp but didn't provide something for smaller alliances, because it's impossible as long as ""bigger"" raising the chances to win a fight. big coalitions will be rewarded by this system and alliances in big coalitions don't make war against each other. this is contradictionary to ccp's wishes and fundamental. iv. to produce something in 0.0 includes transport of huge amounts of minerals accross some sytems. it's cheaper to produce in high sec, because the cost in 0.0 are the transporting ship plus the guards. in high sec there is only the working time for one pilot. b. propositioni. develop the marked. todays concept is resulting from a time, when ccp had no dedicated server for the marked. develop a game mechanic that makes it possible to exchange products across sov borders so everyone that has capital can be a part of a global marked. with this proposition allianzes will be able to produce all ships and modules in 0.0. and carebears will be able to produce in 0.0 for every other entity in 0.0. todays trading system is the death to a globalized marked and forces carebears into high sec, because they can meet each other there. until now, without jita an entity in the south hasn't access to tech and vice versa. ii make production in 0.0 much cheaper than in high. researchtime for bpo's should be shortened in 0.0. reduce production times and demand for materials in 0.0. so investent in guards for transport will be rewarded by the lesser effort to produce something.iii. make it easier to mine and transport minerals, at least one or to years to start a movement to 0.0. iv. change the mechanic that bigger is better. raise cost at least quadratically for alliances and sov about a certain size. prefer better strategy over force in fleet battles. remarkspecialisation in game is not a problem. it's a problem of the game mechanics that specialisation is located to certain areas like highsec. but to force specialisation into other areas will take away the fun out of game of many players."
5/11/2011,"sadly you're right in the point but all you get for saying truth it's trolls and stone age comments.i have a sun, aged now of 18 and tried to bring him to eve.in just a few days he just said to me that eve's for fools or masochists. no feeling he was doing something good or wrong, grieffers, can flippers, scamers... someone took him to pvp, obviously he lost his ship faster than he got in to the fight or understood what he had to do.he just left. he just told me to try some fps (free), me that hates that stuff where every one shoots you from every where and always head shots you !!he was right, when you can't or don't want to spend more than 1 or 2 hours playing internet games any fps is more fun, dynamic than any activity in eve.unfortunately this is not ready to change because of those stone age players and centenarian minds incapable to evolve. they are happy with what they have why change it?edit: it's pretty nice to talk about eve's marketing but what tools do we dispose?does ccp fixed any goal to achieve that we know? -nodoes ccp fixed any kind of player interesting them more than another? -no, opposed to some nerds comments nothing says witch is the kind of eve's player or not and their player type target, and it's certainly not some nerd dev's signature the official version. so at the end, what are we talking about right here?"
5/11/2011,"firstly pos modsremove that horrible drag system give us a grid based on the towers that shows valid locations and let us click anchor.silos, miners, reaction arrays etc etc need to be combined together into set objects which have bays for each areas, there is no need for 6 mods when there is no flexibility.fuel needs a work over in general make different mods require different bits rather than having only 2 that change, i'm pretty sure lo and heavy water do not make my guns fire, where as mechanical parts and enriched uranium probably do.pos mails need to just say what is the problem i.e. ""i need liquid ozone"", ""i need oxygen isotopes"".pos statuses should be viewable from the corporate tab including hp and fuel amounts, if we can get mails why can't we get a nice ui about it too.shield resists need to be more even with a 0%, a 12.5% a 25% and a 37.5% depending on race.pos weapons should not require ammo but should instead use up fuel reserves and preferably should reflect the drones that each race uses and not use the standard normal ammo.pos ewar, they should have bit in racial electronic warfare to reflect the recon ships of each race, i mean why would you build a object with a shield and no weapons to defend itself."
5/11/2011,"i think the velator is a wonderful noob ship. it just needs a teensy bit more powergrid, such that a pilot with engineering 5 and advanced weapon upgrades 5 could fit two neutron blasters :)the reaper is the quintessential minmatar ship - bunch of parts flung together to produce a fast, light craft.the ibis and impairor are rather dull looking."
5/11/2011,"i like this idea. give them more of a guided experience of their choosing; i.e. pvp, industry, exploration. i don't know about a 3 month term, but a ccp protected academy for the first month to show them the options of eve and basics to the main styles of play. as mentioned, military academy could set times (ut) for fleet combat to opposing factions, yet w/o risk of losing sp or their own isk. we're talking t1 frigs maybe cruisers. then after the ""protected"" month or trial period, they graduate and now it's off to rl eve. upon graduating they could recieve lp, a new ship and standings. would probably make for much better immersion into the game, plus you establish more friendships with ppl that you went to the academy with. of course they could just drop out, get nothing... and take the hard road. this would also avoid, forcing alts to go do the academy thing again."
5/11/2011,"excellent idea, both. starting players in 'factional warfare' as a bootcamp recruit helps add some life into fw, and introduces future pvpers to the mechanics of killing. have other player corps like red frog offer positions for new haulers (give rf some sort of tax benefit for taking on noobs, and pay noobs to do simple courier contracts for a salary... etc.)i think that either having both npc institutions like militia (pvp) and interbus (courier) or concord (policing) and player corps like red frog or eve university play a part in the training of new characters (with incentive for the player corps, of course) that would make the npe much better. also, if we stop the necessity of every player having to play 2 alts in order to survive in this game, that would open up the player base as well. (but discussion is better left to the other thread :)"
5/11/2011,"hells yes, i'd go with option 3."
5/11/2011,supported.
5/11/2011,"great idea, but just one question, what is supposed to happens with those battles that take about 3 hours to end?? are those gonna take 30 hours? (in our time relatively speaking of course)"
5/11/2011,"ladies will agree, bigger it is better it is.supported"
5/11/2011,mmmmm
5/11/2011,"while the concept of fixing ""small day to day things that annoy players"" is awesome, i'm very concerned at the quote above (which got buried in the massive pile of tinfoil and fetal alcohol syndrome that is the eip thread). game balance changes with such wide implications should not be sat on a list next to ""now theres a picture of your face in the trade window""."
5/11/2011,"not supported blackops are fine as they are (except the sin, that does need some work). but all the others i feel are balanced.the only change that bops need is a bigger fuel bay and bigger jump range so they can actual achieve their intended purpose of being able to surprise jump people and bridge recon fleets. they were not meant to be solo gank machines and should require use of support and proper planning. i run fleets with bops with corp mates quite a bit and the only thing that we feel greatly limits us is lack of jump range and stupidly small fuel bays. (tbh its more the fuel bay than the jump range but you get the idea)"
5/11/2011,supported
5/11/2011,supported. would make people actually use them offensively instead of just covert portaling in the bombers...
5/11/2011,people already do use them offensively. in fact in my corps recent b'op fleet we've been asking for b'op bs only and not offering any portals as it too much hassle controlling fuel consumption.
5/11/2011,have you ever fit a black ops?
5/11/2011,"not supported. black ops don't need covert ops cloaks.i don't really understand the argument that having a covert ops cloak would make more people use them, which would somehow make them better. i'd love to get an explanation from someone who supports this endeavor. rarely, if ever, are you using gates with your black ops. even when you do use gates, being able to align at more than 75% speed while cloaked makes it simple. utilize your jump drive and drop onto the people you want to kill. why warp around cloaked when you can covertly drop your black ops anywhere in a system without the need to warp.i just don't see the logic. actually make an argument so we can discuss your thoughts. blacks ops needs/wants:1) modest jump range increase. i'd even be happy with 5.5 max. jc5 is, and should continue to be, absolutely essential for intended black ops use. (if you want to be able to ""insert forces into hostile territory, make it so i don't need to be next door with jc5)2) fuel bay increase. to be honest, i'm on the fence about this. while i'd love to see my bo carrier 13k topes without playing with my fit, i don't believe it's entirely necessary. if i'm just bridging, i fit my sin for gas can and can carrying upwards of 30,000 oxy topes. if i'm bridging and fighting, i need to bring a transport ship for the ride. if i'm just dropping solo, the standard fuel bay is typically fine."
5/11/2011,there is already a thread on these which can be found hereplease remember to check the thread hot topics of the assmebly hall before posting duplicate threads.
5/11/2011,"i'm not sure if you are being serious or just trying to troll (forgive me if the former, but you may want to choose a better name) but if you want people to consider your proposal (and even then sometimes they won't :) you may have to spend a bit more time laying out exactly the problem you are trying to solve for here, and how the proposal will proportedly solve it, and point out any unexpected potential side effects it may have. (although the veterans in the forum will no doubt do that for you if you miss any).the first point alone seems a little too far fetched with way too many negative reprocussions (what is an aggressive module?) to accept without more clarification.i usually take the side of the carebears in these matters (hey someone has to, as our csm are all nullsec alliance pvp'ers.) but even then i find it hard to support this."
5/11/2011,cool story bro.
5/11/2011,i too feel that nullsec alliances should have all of their logistics guys commit suicide.
5/11/2011,"oh, you find numbers confusing? this explains alot."
5/11/2011,"i actually agree with anna in principle, though i cannot corroborate her facts on low-sec (as i have never personally lived there). but in the occasions that i have been in lowsec, they were deserted, except for the factional war zone in low sec.so if the situation she is referring to exists, then i agree, it needs to be fixed. bottom line, every ecosystem (and economy) needs a balance of all participants. if one side out weighs another, the system eventually dies. predators like lions survive because they only kill what they can eat, and only when they are good enough hunters to do so. prey like antelope survive as a species because they have the numbers to do so. if you allow pvpers unchecked open season on haulers and indies, then you risk killing them all off, starving yourselves of a steady income and living. now this eventually forces everyone in this game to have both a pvp alt, and a carebear alt in order to 'survive' as a team (metagaming!) which some on this thread argue is the point of eve. but i don't think it needs to be. i think that ccp can get a lot more players into this game if you allow people the freedom to (economically, viably) choose to play completely in the space of ""farming"" or ""rogues"", without mixing the two in order to survive. why do you think there are so few girls in this game? because this forced economic necessity to be a fighter in an alt is a turn off for us. free the people from the burden of having to defend themselves if they just want to play a business mogul, or a hauler, or a ratter. yes, this opens up the game to ""farmville"" players, and i'm sure our 'manly man' csms won't have any of that. but i think if they really *thought* about it, adding more people in eve only helps the game, lines ccps pockets and makes one of the best virtual micro-economies even better by ensuring future sustained growth. and there will still be plenty of places in the universe to 'be a guy'."
5/11/2011,you were spoon fed the figures and thier source. it's not his fault you have a room temperature iq and cannot comprehend them.
5/11/2011,"there are not several definitions of griefer, just scum that fit it or not."
5/11/2011,"yes a group of bombers can create havoc (small group), even a solo bomber ( solo bomber) but the fact remains that jump bridges have done nothing but help create nothing but carebears and blob warfare. when a fleet can just run to there jb and safely retreat several systems away at the slight hint of a loss or call in that insta blob of 100 pilots for a solo ship is just rediculous. 0.0 has become nothing but a carebear land of blobs that cannot fight solo and rely on there 10v1 odds to win a fight. i myself cannot wait for the nerf."
5/11/2011,i think you dropped some straw when you made that man.
5/11/2011,"i fully understand that margin trading is a helpful tool in making you richer.however the issues with it is that it's not helpful in the game as it stands.if it effected game play i'd totally agree with you but as far as i can tell it does.however i did think of a solution, some may not like this but i think it's a nice easy and good solution.market orders made by margin trading ability are subject to a negative isk penalty of the base order (i.e. if you had to put down 24million out of 100million it would be removed from your character).unless the order comes to a natural end by the time limit or there is enough isk for the sale to go through.legitimate buyers are more than likely to not enjoy this penalty however scammers would be at risk of loosing isk adverse to gaining isk if someone caused the buy order to fail.i also like this idea very much, it'd be even better if it highlighted them in red .*edit*or even just removed them from visibility on the market."
5/11/2011,"this is no problem, because all of you have to be aware of scams and it's easy to avoid them."
5/11/2011,"isn't there some fine that is charged to the toon if they cannot cover a buy order? can we not have negative balances? i don't see the problem really, can't you avoid this problem altogether by testing out any fishy too good to be true buy orders by lifting a couple from the bid before you commit to obtaining the large quantities?"
5/11/2011,it'd be easier if there was no minimum quantity as most scammers put it at a number just below the amount they have.
5/11/2011,"and then when you're trying to buy components for somethign in bulk, you have to warp between 50 stations picking up 1 trit in each, as opposed to all in one."
5/11/2011,"yes, absolutely. in fact my original statement was:"
5/11/2011,"thanks! can i ask that you support it by clicking the ""support this topic"" checkbox so that csm may read it and consider it?"
5/11/2011,"why would anyone generate a contract to have themselves hauled somewhere else?i can imagine a wardec target trying to ship themselves out of a station - would the wardec extend to passenger transport? what about when the transport is killed, do you have pilots sitting in capsules or some form of special pilot carriage?what happens if i log in but my ferry was blown up and i'm still sitting in a pilot carriage?"
5/11/2011,"i think most of your questions have already been answered in the chain.great point about the wardec though, that would be an additional reason you may want to travel like a civilian. as for whether the wardec extends to the carrier, my preliminary thought is no. you should not be able to endanger the carriage by your wardec. thanks for the insight!"
5/11/2011,do gate campers get to inspect the cargo of a passenger ferry? can you identify the passengers?what benefit does a passenger ferry service provide that a shuttle on autopilot can't?
5/11/2011,"i think we should let cargo scanners see the passengers (how else would pirates be able to judge which are the high worth targets?) we want to help the kidnapping/piracy industry as much as build up the hauling profession after all.but this by no means allows a pirate to attack a ferry (without consequence) even if he has a passenger which is legally wardec'd. civilian transports should be protected by concord (up to the sec status of the system allows).as for your second question:1) security. shuttles have none. but if you make a lucrative carriage contract, and insisting on a high quality of ferryman. (clean record, high success ratio) then it can be presumed that they are good at their job. perhaps they take you on a battleship (ala clear skies) or a freighter, both are safer than a shuttle.2) convenience. i have to actually be online, and preferably not afk to use a shuttle. what if i don't want to be? what if i am a fb farmville industrialist who is hired by an alliance to take care of their pi for a sector, and i log in only once a week to play? i really wouldn't care for flying 50 jumps across null space to get to my next 'job' location, and since i need to only login every couple of days to earn my pay, urgency is not a problem.3) and of course, this adds the dimension to the economy that both feeds (and grows) more haulers (of every level, not just big time bulk freighter captains, but small time mom and pop ferry operations) and it makes a new isk source for pirates. (making them less dependent on carebear alts to survive)"
5/11/2011,i am entering text into a troll discussion.
5/11/2011,"you know there are other systems of democracy out there that work better, namely constituent based representation. (parliamentary system) if 100% of players see themselves as 0.0ers, then 100% of csm should be 0.0ers. if its a 30/20/50 split, then so should the number of seats be allocated in the csm to reflect this ratio. right now the problem with this system is that its more like a high school prom queen contest, or a dictatorship puppet democracy.can anyone think of a good reason why the number of seats in csm7 should not be determined by a census of players? (or something like a qen snapshot?)i'm totally fine with goons dominance of the portion of csm seats alloted to nullsec delegates, (assuming they get the popular null sec votes). i am against the whole of csm being dominated by nullsec players (unless 100% of the players in eve are nullsec players) just because of a flaw in the voting system. leaving a large portion of the players unrepresented with little csm expertise in some areas of gameplay. by the way, the flaw in the pseudo-democracy system here is that its a popular vote system. every player gets 1 vote, each is worth the same, and there are no limits to the seats on csm up for election.what this is analogous to is this: have anyone who is an an american be allowed to run for congress. there are 20 congress seats up for grabs. with no restrictions on where the candidates are living to determine validity of candidacy. does this sound fair? if it does, your congress would be full of californians and new yorkers as they have they highest populations and everyone will likely vote for 'their own'.taken to the next level, if we let ccp run the elections for the united nations, all your representatives would be chinese. sure, lot's of these chinese ministers do have it in their hearts to do a good job representing you westerners, but when it comes down to it, if it came to a point where they have to make a decision that would harm china in lieu of benefiting americans, do you think that they would? would you trust them to be impartial?"
5/11/2011,"given that the last csm is working on things for 0.0, from the devblog about the jb nerf there is plenty more in the works, does it not make sense to have a lot of 0.0 input on things? a bunch of empire carebears are not the people who should be deciding how sov warfare changes. even with a nullsec dominated csm, we're getting hit with the nerf bat over and over again, with an all empire csm it would only get worse.who would you rather put in charge of a ship? the guy who'd been commanding ships for years, or the guy who once went on a ferry and got seasick in the harbour?"
5/11/2011,why is this stupid thread still opened?
5/11/2011,":) so you think that the world should be ruled by chinese?seriously though, i agree with your point. put the experts to do what they do best. but that isn't the problem. the problem is not how csm executes their job. the problem is misrepresentation of the population in eve, which is contradictory to csm's reason for being.i don't know what csm5 was up to, and if you say it was 100% 0.0 stuff, then my arguement is that it shouldn't have been, if 70% of paying eve players are 'carebears'. csm's job is to help decide the *priority* of changes to be made, and it makes no sense if csm doesn't represent the population distribution of their constituents in doing so.yes. and i wouldn't be putting a nascar driver at the helm of the boat either, and being a 0.0 expert (nascar star) doesn't automatically make you a good ship captain. csm needs to have all representation from all citizens of eve, because some people are in ships while some are playing nascar in the game. if 50% of players operate in 0.0, then you only need mittani and 5 others on csm. the other 6 seats should go to people from other backgrounds in different parts of the game. i seriously don't see why anyone should think that this isn't the right thing to do (especially when you choose to identify yourself as a member of whichever constituent you wish in the 'census') but anyway, it's all too late now for csm6. i'm not advocating we impeach the existing representation. they were voted in, using the (flawed) rules of the current system after all, and i am no anarchist. i am just suggesting an overhaul to the csm election rules for csm7 which should make csm more true to their espirit d'etat, and for that and only that, i wish to support this thread."
5/11/2011,"so where do you draw the constituency lines? people in eve don't have permenant addresses. on top of that it sounds like what you really want is one constituency per playstyle in which case who gets to decide which groups of people are worthy of their own representative and which aren't? even then thats basically the equivalent of saying every political party gets one member of parliament and they can vote interally as to who it is. constituencies (at least here in the uk) aim to be roughly equal size, how do you propose to work with that? the closest you could get is probably dividing people by character age but my gut feeling says you'd end up with the same result as we got in the last election with way more overhead."
5/11/2011,"i, too, think this is an urgent situation that demands ccp's immediate attention. the csm have barely finished moving in to their offices at the start of their term and it's already evident that they're doubleplus ungood and will destroy eve, then the real world, followed by day 3.apparently the op and i are the only ones here who can see the future. (either that, or op is a mittani alt looking for more attention, in which case i'm a bad llama for feeding the troll)."
5/11/2011,"actually, somehow this issue isn't that stupid at all. yes the csm delegates have been elected by players, every account had a chance to vote for a candidate they liked..but.i'm in one of the big alliances, and it's absolutely usual to ""ask"" the members to vote for our own candidate; more because the alliance wants more ""political power"" or better oportunities to alter game mechanics the way they like then the candidate to be a representative for all eve players. however you have to understand that thats the way politics work in the real world too - just consider alliances as political parties: they normaly vote for own candidates; its the same in eve.just my 2 cents"
5/11/2011,"who cares who calls the tunes, who cares who pulls the punches, the damage is done."
5/11/2011,"if ccp wants to keep changing skills around, then they must reimburse the isk and sp for the things they are taking away. that's my only concern. these books are aprox 15mil each with lp costs...way more than the learning skills."
5/11/2011,holy oldpost batman! no dynamic quality! devs cleared that up on the next page or so of that thread.also brand new devpost is best post!
5/11/2011,"thanks for the update. i guess this means that l5 agent lp will go up since they were all l12 before. run, run to the l5 agents my friends!"
5/11/2011,except my tests showed their pay decreased due to lp getting axed. small boost from the being q20 is far outweighed by the loss of that 50% lp bonus.
5/11/2011,"the lp is worth more. that aside, it's horrible for the economy. lp shop is a big isk sink. what they should have done is boost lp payout, nerf bounty and isk payout, drastically increase isk cost of shop exchanges, and remove tag requirement."
5/11/2011,which would send the prices of implants and faction mods into freefall.
5/11/2011,"well, originally i thought that we needed to remove the rats and add the warp disruption. create a place where fights were inevitable, and where both parties could have a reasonable chance of victory.a place where people could choose to commit to combat, and not be able to retreat until the combat was resolved.however, this would never work on its own, because any pilot or small gang would inevitably be overwhelmed by a bigger gangs.the button/tower locking anyone on grid means cloak traps will not work in plex, so roaming counter plexers will be able to see exactly what ships wait for them on d-scan before committing to combat.the plexers would die.then i thought the easy way around that is to limit the number of ships in the plex at once!warp gates have all sorts of locks and conditions, why not set it so that it only admits fw parties, and then only allows a certain number from each side?originally, i wanted it to work like a wormhole, with a mass limit and a max hull weight cap, coz this would indeed alllow people to try and take on ten frigates in their solo bs or suchlike, but for now im happy to talk about a simple 5 activation limit per team per plex.the only problem i can see is this:what if a plexing party each dual boxed an alt in the opposing militia, and locked genuine counter plexers out of running plexes by bringing their alts in with them to each plex? yeah, its a lot of effort, but this is eve.what if?in this case, the system is broken.so im going back to thinking about it for a bit more...feel free to chuck a few ideas in :)"
5/11/2011,"or do we accept that any system we devise will be exploited in some way, so by this standard the above exploit is difficult enough to pull off that it can be overlooked?alt spies in the same plex as the mains?would people risk exposing their spies like that?"
5/11/2011,"i don't see what people are complaining about, the game worked fine before jump bridges were implemented."
5/11/2011,i like the first change that will go live :)there goes the cap advantage for the defenders in a cynojammed sys
5/11/2011,"a step in the right direction, i use gates 90% of the time and ignore jb's. i feel that we in 0.0 are to dependent on them."
5/11/2011,"the game worked fine before supercaps and t3 ships were implemented, we should probably remove those too."
5/11/2011,"considering that the raison d'etre of bridges is no longer part of eve (pos based soverignty and associated logistics) the 'nerf' is actually very reasonable.going to require a period of adjustment for the people who have never lived without them, but somehow i think they'll muddle through. in the mean time, lets hope (and lobby for) ccp making the industrial side of null the first thing to be addressed out of the 'long term' items, so the jita withdrawal symptoms are cut as short as possible."
5/11/2011,"its common knowledge that nullsec is safer then highsec, this is huge problem. nullsec, null security, no existent security, void security, zero security, nada security, rien security whatever you call it, the only security that should exist in these areas should be provided by players, not by game mechanics, and last time i checked, jump gates are not players.also another big problem with jump gates, they make the universe a small place, being in the far outer regions should have a meaning, instant travelling shouldnt be possible. it should always be a difficult task to travel in/out o nullsec, with the distance involved and the dangerous around it, players should have to plan convoys for logistics; fleet travelling would be fun and challenging again."
5/11/2011,"did you just put convoys and fun in the same sentence? lol. this will not result in more small gang pvp, short term it will result in more ganks, long term just in more high sec lvl 4 mission runners (you can claim what you want, it is alot safer in high sec than in 0.0).this will not result in smaller naps, it will result in larger naps (by making it much harder to get caps in cynojammed systems it is harder to defend against an opponent that outnumbers you, simple solution: make sure you outnumber the opponent, nap more). this will not make it easier for smaller entities to get going in 0.0, for the large entities jb expenses are only a small part of the bill, much smaller than the ammount spend on supercap production. small entities will spend alot more relative on jbs, and now they need many more jb systems for roughly the same network, so a much steeper increase in total cost than large entities.this is an indirect boost to supercaps.and what it is all about for ccp most likely, in the end it even more forces you to have several accounts, either to run missions in high sec or cyno alts to just transport more with jump capable ships and less with jbs (and **** new players who dont have caps).apparently this is all offset by some new ideas of ccp that are supposed to be not total crap, which is doubtfull if ccp has the idea, but they will come some time in the 'future'. i expect it right after iterations on fw, storefronts, and a pi that resembles anything close to what ccp promised. in other words, that can take many years before it comes.edit: not that ccp has any clue about 0.0 with their causality model made by a 3-year-old, but luckily we got wis coming"
5/11/2011,what i really want to know from the csm... is if ccp made them aware of these changes. or if this was another time when they have not even consulted.... if this is the case... what is the csm even for? if ccp doesnt seem to use it...hopefully someone in the csm will comment soon.
5/11/2011,"the full daily production capacity of all conquerable 0.0 is enough to let a full 250 maelstrom fleet shoot t2 ammo for a bit over an hour (most other ships use more ammo), the other 99.75% of the 0.0 population won't have ammo that day. so no, nerfing jbs isn't going to make the littlest difference in how much ammo is imported from jita. if ccp wants nullsec to be more independent they need to boost its production capabilities."
5/11/2011,"this has been tried in that place known as the real world to some benefit. the idea is simple, concord decides there are to many super capitols in capsuleer hands. due to this hard caps would be set on a per chassis basis for example 24 titans of each racial and 30 sc's of each racial. this would once again add value to them since they are now everywhere! it's becoming super capitol eve online. this is not a troll, but with all the threats going around on how to kill them and op just leave as is and make them more rare. once one is lost then a new one can be placed into the cooker and then all others are locked out. just a thought, i'll try and refine it more later, but any thoughs or comments?"

5/11/2011,after reading the asinine jb proposal i don't trust ccp to chance anything anymore.
5/11/2011,"i would like to see a ccp dev statement that ganking is 'working as designed' because honestly i've heard so many people say this so matter-of-factly as if by the nature of everyone repeating it it must be true. i really don't know myself, but i refuse to believe something blindly without justification. somewhere else in the threads somebody mentioned that long time ago, in eve, it wasn't as easy as it is now to gank. whether it cost more to the ganker (in terms of lower insurance payouts, or their were less alpha/insta-pop ship fit outs that can kill most indies without any fighting chance.) i think since then ganking has gotten too easy, and there are pretty much no real negative to ganking save a sec penalty hit. what has happened is that the system is now imbalanced to the point that the small time hauler is almost an endangered species, and hauling as a profession is almost dead, unless you can pilot a freighter. ganking is part of the game, yes. it has a place. but it shouldn't be as easy as it is now. such imbalanced ganking was likely an unexpected side effect of some other unrelated play balance changes to some modules or insurance policies, and i don't think was intended by ccp."
5/11/2011,"just make the insurance company think of its bottom-line like it should, removes the 'lol-suicide' while leaving suicides a viable 'profession'.in short: void insurance on concordokken."
5/11/2011,"i move my valuable items in an agility-rigged blockade runner with a covops cloak fitted. in over 4 years of play i have never ever been suicide ganked. it would be incredibly difficult for anyone to gank me in empire.ganking is only ever ""easy"" when the victims choose to make it easy. people who afk autopilot, people who dont tank their ships, people who use an 800k industrial to move hundreds of millions of isk worth of modules - these are the people that get ganked because they make it easy and profitable for the gankers to do so. dont complain that ccp isn't doing enough to make ganking dificult, blame the lazy, ignorant, arrogant players who do everything they can to make ganking easy and profitable.and before anyone tries to dismiss this as ""blame the victim"", yes i am blaming the victims, because it's they who are at fault. with a minimal amount of effort and attention, they could completely obviate the problem, but instead they choose to whine and cry for mommy ccp to protect them instead.it is so ridiculously easy to avoid being ganked that anyone who gets ganked deserves our derision, not our sympathy. and certainly not even more protection from concord.incidentally, suicide ganking has been made more difficult by 2 concord buffs and the insurance nerf last year. however it has been boosted by the artillery and torpedo changes. i'd say it's about even compared with how it's ever been. i'm certainly not seeing anything that leads me to believe that it's more prevelent than it used to be."
5/11/2011,"this discussion has veered from an idea to provide a deterrent to getting ganked to the pros and cons of ganking.i myself am in favor of ganking even though i have never been a recipient of one. what the op wants is a situationwhere she is flying and gets scanned. the bad guy (tm) sees the bomb in the cargo hold and has to decide quicklywhether to go ahead and pop a ship knowing he likely won't get loot or start looking for another target. that'swhat this proposal is about. is it a good idea? some will say yes, others will say no. i like the idea for tworeasons. first it's an active option a pilot can take. (i want to decide what to do with my stuff) i may not getthe goods from point a to point b but the ganker won't get my goods either! (which is what i understood from theop) two, it's a great isk sink against the hauler. if pilots start putting bombs in their own cargo hold i bet allgankers will really make sure no one has the goods! also the bomb itself will be an expense for the pilot whowants that peace of mind. my response to the op was tongue in cheek but my offer was serious. a bomb for the cargo hold is something that canbe implemented. but even if ccp likes it i think some time will pass before this is even considered. anyway iwill be posting the tft construct detonator in this thread so everyone can see what would be involved in trashingcargo. (besides putting a menu option for the cargo hold where pilots can trash items in space)"
5/11/2011,"hello eve community i think that player should be able to customize their ship with decals or skin. it would be really interesting to see different skins for ships, after all player buy their ship so why not costumizing them since its their property and not the empire one? just like wwii pilot liked to paint their planes and bombs it would just add a touch of creativity to the game and would make peoples more enjoying their ships.option 1: ingame costumiser just like the caracter creator you can modify your ship paint and add decals to it and then a optional feature would be taht you could save this skin and sell it on market for some isk? i think it would be a good idea and artist would have a place in the gameoption 2: out of game editor that artist would use to craete skins and sell them for some isk to player wanting to feel specialnote: of course custom skins would be togable on/off *deffault off*this little addition could increase the game population i think and isnt really hard to realise i guess.if you ever played trackmania you understand how the editor would work a bit or well this is how i would make it so its easy usage so everyone can have fun with their ships.just my two cents *sorry for my bad english im a french speaker*any idea are welcomednote: if you are new in the forum to support the idea you need to check teh case when your posting that say you agree with general idea thx in advance ^^"

5/11/2011,"supported, kill bridges."
5/11/2011,"lolwut? more macro miners = cheaper minerals = deflation != inflation.in any case, i think this is a good idea; the core of the game is pvp (whether it be in pew pew or trading or whatever) and mining is just insanely boring content (so is missions imo and really pretty much everything you have to do to get ahead in this game and get to the fun stuff which could be manufacturing/research/high level industry or pvp). why do people think it is so important for someone to have to go through the boringness of mining in order to make a few isk? if manufacturing required you moved stuff around the factory all day there would probably be botters doing that too and people would be whining about it and would insist that those poor carebears keep spending their time on it goddamn it. but luckily manufacturing requires no real life time investment next to the isk investment. i don't see why mining should because it's definitely not more fun than the hypothetical moving parts around in a 2d factory screen so an isk and skill investment for the modules to engage in mining should suffice and require no further investment of time because if you think mining is more fun than say any other past-time then and yes, obviously you will have to invest some real time before you get to the part where you can automate the whole isk-making process but it won't be an endless grind and it will take away the botter's advantage and probably run them straight out of business.full support, good idea, ccp should do this yesterday. the only reason ccp will not is because of the intense oversupply this could create on the mineral market and distorting the economic balance heavily.i've not once heard a convincing argument on how macro miners are actually bad for the game? for pvp'ers with isk in their wallets it's good because more supply = lower prices = more stuff you can buy with your isk. and since the amount of isk you get from missions isn't price-adjusted (afaik) the only people who suffer from botters are actual miners who put in their time because without macro's everything would be (a lot?) more expensive."
5/11/2011,"not supportedremove the plexes, so it will remove the bots.i prefer play with 25k players than 25k players + 25k bots"
5/11/2011,"this is an interesting idea. it would completely change the markets to one where you placed new orders instead of updating old ones. updating becomes impssible in most markets as each update severely cuts into you profitability, basically doubling your fees. one place i can see a huge problem with this, however, is in large ticket items.right now if i want to trade in towers or faction ships i pu in my 1-300 mil for a 1 unit order and update the order to grab the item, generally looking at a 5-10% profit. with this system it would turn into some kind of horrible ""price is right"" game where the nex dude puts up a .01 bid and i now am stuck with 2 choices: update and eat into profits, or do nothing and hope that his order clears. if it doesn't the only way my order will clear is if there is a market swing, which could see me loosing money if it does clear.often times i will update orders down if i see the market shifting. you're removing that option.another problem is that you are giving a massive advantage to people who have superlow fees (due to standings). those players will have massively lower update costs, so they have a better margin to beging with and are able to update more often.interesting idea but i don't think it would work."
5/12/2011,"i'm on the fence on this one, as i have never piloted one, but just playing devil's advocate, i would like to ask if anyone has considered the unexpected side effects of these buffs?i mean, i think buffs to other ships in the past, though meaning well and did fix the problems with the ships that they were meant to fix, caused shifts in the play balance in the game, which were unintentional (for example, i think somebody in the forums once mentioned that suicide ganking is now much easier and cost effective for the ganker than before).i would then hypothesize that allowing a bo ship to use covert ops cloak would make it the griefing ship of choice."
5/12/2011,"im just going to leave this here for the people who think black ops cant fight toe to toe, you just need to have the right setup.as for what boosts i would like to see for them i dont think a covert cloak is going to be helpful, its supposed to be a support ship not some solo gank mobile. however i certainly wouldnt argue against boosts in their tank, dps and jump range or against a substantial increase in their fuel bay size because that increases their ability to do what they were supposed to do in the first place, to support and enhance covert gangs."

5/12/2011,bellicouse - needs compleatly gutting and reworked from the ground upomen - small boost to grid and cpu destroyers in general need some tweeking to make a bit more newbie friendlywell thats just my 2 isk for the time being in terms of balance.
5/12/2011,"needs significantly more than a small boost.umm, what? being newbie friendly is just about all destroyers are good for right now, they need a total rethink to be honest. ""anti-frigate"" would be a very nice role if there weren't a large selection of cruisers that can do the same job better while also not being made of paper with a bloated sig radius."
5/12/2011,"there's more than enough arguments here, thank you.i shouldn't really need one, but since you insist: nerfing makes ships die faster, and makes them less likely to be used. the more ships get nerfed, the less time each player who flies them will last on the battlefield, and battles will become shorter. players with less 'good' ships to choose from, will end up all flying the same thing, which is pretty much what is happening now.people want to stay in the battle, not float in a pod or wake up 10 jumps away with a session timer or three. buffing ships means more likelihood they'll be used in combat, (and generally), and that they're more likely to stay in the battle longer. currently ships are stupid, and very poorly balanced, and i am beginning to think that is the way it will stay.unblancing things a little is good. a bugati veyron should be better than a camaro, but lets face it, they are also much very expensive. things don't work that way in eve. fact: cruisers category is completely unbalanced, and most should be faster and stronger. so should their tech ii counterparts. battleships should generally be better too, and destroyers should have their place.destroyers are not, (roughly quoted), ""..too easily bypassed by beginning players in skill traing."" sorry, but that opinion is blind and utter bull****, and ccp needs to rethink their , (also roughly quoted), ""..intended to have"" strategy on ship function.a tier system is fine, as long as you actually use it as intended. putting 4 different ships into a single tier, within a class of ships, then reworking each of them to suit their faction philosophy while ignoring how that affects their use and effectiveness is dumb, and possibly just plain stupid. fictional quote: ""it's not gallente, it shouldn't have a reasonable drone bay!"" -qfs, it should have one and no bonuses, as only gallente should get those.the latest bit from the dev's in the question response thread was very disheartening in this regard, with answers to related questions revealing an attitude that 'intended' is always right. that's stupid and naive, not to mention lazy. to balance ships within a tier, all you need do is give them all approx. the same stats, then apply their faction bonuses. if they don't balance, then it's because the factions don't balance, and this will hold true through all tiers and classes. randomly selecting crap doesn't work, so stop doing it. creativity has no place in the design process. involving creativity with real statisitics and effectiveness in gameplay is completely stupid, and should be avoided at all costs.balance ships by weight. measure somethings effect on combat in real terms, and use that to balance removing it from one ship within a tier, and adding it to another, while removing something of equal combat value from the first, and applying something of equal value again to the first. 1 tier at a time, and one class at a time, but see if the factions need to be rebalanced a little first. this should also be approached assuming all other things are equal that are equal, and making those that aren't equal equal or using that to determine how you bend each ship in this fashion. either make all turrets equal, (like missiles), or make all ships fit only specific turrets by faction, or cause turrets to adjust the ship with modifiers that bring it closer to the turrets faction, and prevent if from being an exploit, while allowing it to be a way of changing ship characteristics. better to just eliminate role bonuses applying to a specific faction of turret, and make them apply to any turret, rather than making a ship unusable because of them."
5/12/2011,"thanks for your passionate and quite frankly offensive replies. i do enjoy it when people assume what my agenda is. although i admire your passion, please be a little more civilised on the forums.anyway. i agree with your proposal about increasing missile velocity however as far as i understand it, guided missile velocity is already at (or very close to) the maximum it can be. this is of course taking into account skills, implants and ship bonuses. the game physics engine just can't handle it. from the blog i read many years ago i think ccp said that ""missiles behave very strange at very high velocity"". i understand that you want to use missiles to snipe with however the pain of waiting for that initial volley to land can be un(care)bearable. this is why i suggest a flight time reduction and not a velocity reduction.so, to defending my argument about reducing guided missile velocity.i agree a little that light missiles are okay however a slight reduction in flight time, and i mean slight, and a reduction to fitting requirements.heavy missiles, they simply project their damage too far when compared to other weapon systems. this is why the drake out performs most, if not all, other ships of its class in the pve environment. i fly the drake all the time and reducing heavy missile flight time will hurt me but i accept that it's probably required. when looking at the pvp aspect, any heavy missile using ship far outperforms all other ships of their respective classes due to the fact that they do not require to have to sacrifice tank and gank slots to achieve the same range. turrets also must use t2 guns and t2 ammo to achieve similar capabilities where as t1 hml's still perform very well.cruise missiles, these are very much the same as hml's however their use in pvp is limited due to the fact that current in game strategies when fighting at extreme range require shock tactics (read: alpha striking) and players being able to see these missiles flying towards them for 30 seconds before they hit gives them more than enough chance to escape or call for reps.the issue isn't the weapon system but current player tactics due to current game mechanics allowing unlimited people to focus fire on a single target even if their los is blocked."
5/12/2011,target painter bonus on rapier and other mini hulls.the target painter needs to be more effective in what it does. especially for these ships as mid slots are at a premium.the 7.5% bonus is not huge and target painters are better off on other ships where the mid slots are not at such a primum(though mostly a pilot would fit ecm instead).painters are further hampered by diminishing returns and thus again not worth stacking.a painter increase the sig radius of a ship by 30% un bonused. or 41.25% bonused.so your 30m2 frigate goes to....42m2...wow your still not bigger than a destroyer.so even 2 and a frigate only goes to 57m2.a 10% or even 15% bonus would make them actually worth equiping.currently the bonus does not increase a gangs dmg on target enough to be worth it.
5/12/2011,fail matar whine fails
5/12/2011,"oh please. your agenda is blindingly obvious:how many battlecruisers use guided missiles? one. the drake. and as i stated, light missiles are fine while cruises are broken, so what else would you be talking about?combine this with the fact the drake is one of the most whined about ships currently in-game and your agenda couldn't be more obvious if you had a ""nerf caldari"" bumper sticker on your forehead.i am aware of the issues ccp ran into trying this. however i also know there is currently a theoretical maximum of 11km/s on missiles with current fitting/ship requirements*. thus; missile velocity can likely be increased to at least this.why? how exactly are light missiles overpowered range-wise?agreed. 8 power grid (9 on t2?) is absurd for a shipline that's already power grid limited.pve balance is purely coincidental and should be kept apart from pvp balance. drake mission performance is irrelevant to this issue.apples and oranges. missiles have a completely different damage reduction formula to turrets, i can alpha quite a few frigates at 70km with my artycane, this wouldn't be possible with a drake.there's also the slight issue that turrets lack flight time.when your lasers take 20 seconds to reach their target, then you can talk about nerfing long range missile fire.(re:cruises) it is completely the weapon. this is a launcher intended to be used at long ranges, which is competing with 3 other weapon systems that do comperable dps with instant damage.having flight time is an acceptable limitation to cruise missiles - taking 30 seconds to reach their target is not. *said example is a velocity rigged cerberus with light missiles"
5/12/2011,as a lowly corp members in nullsec storage is the problem.we need storage space in corp hangers; most corps allow members access to 1 shared tab.all this allows us to do is put cans in there that we name to know who owns what. we have to remove them to open them.this limits us to cans that hold 3'900 m3 of space. at least change it so we can open cans in corp hangers again at poss.this would atleast allow access to station containers.a private member tab on corp hangers would be great but just been able to open containers in pos corp hangers would solve issues short term.
5/12/2011,"a) let alliance members with starbase defence use pos guns.b) let alliance members actually access and use assembly arrays and hangars.c) let alliance members do something other than me and pe research at a lab (copying, invention, reverse engineering etc.)d) base corp standing for anchoring in hi/lo sec on ceo/director average rather than the whole corp.to be honest the first three have the permission mechanics in place at the moment, you just need to actually allow use of a pos hangar when specified in the dropdown menu."

5/12/2011,"some ingame tutorial vids that apear on the large main screen in your cpatains quarters would be a great start, and a huge reduction in the amount of reading that needs to be done, one of the main turn offs for me when i started was the sheer amount of reading that had to be done when i started in that tiny print. of course text is also good as something to refer back to so a compromise woudl be cool."
5/12/2011,"that free implant that is provided to the first character on new accounts created with the eve retail version should be extended to the first character on every new account activation. years ago, you'd start out in a decent frigate with 1-2 million sp, and now you start in a terrible, ugly ship with less than 100k sp."
5/12/2011,"bring back character background and base skills. developing your character background and skill base doesn't have to be exactly what it once was, but it should be more than it is. it helps to develop a connection to the character, while preventing the need for a great deal of skill training, just to get into the game. current sp limitations, (about 54k sp at start), leave a new player unprepared for pretty much anything, resulting in even the 'crash course' and base tutorials needed skills to be trained, just to complete the missions. when i've done the tutorials, under the new system, i've found myself potentially held up for hours, waiting for skills to train, just to complete my next tutorial mission. this leaves new players with nothing to do except chat, which most likely causes a loss of interest in playing and a greater interest in chatting.i know, as it has happened to me with several of my characters. i wait for skills to train, and plan out my skill training and remaps, and end up not playing because my training queue is limited to core skills, or charisma skills, or just ships, and no support skills. i don't really consider a character to be 'ready for eve', until they have a chieved more than 10 million sp.ready is dependent on an assorted variety of skills and with 54k sp to start, and remapping required to train efficiently, that 54k might as well be nothing. what's the use of flying a ship, with only 2500 sp in gunnery and missiles combined, even if you have 7 million split between electronics, engineering, and mechanics, that is insiufficient.i remember, as a new player, my sp went everywhere, with little concern for attribute bonuses. i wanted to play the game, and i trained to do it as fast as possible. it was totally inefficient, but got me what i wanted in the short run. at the time, i even had the benefit of having the starting sp from gallente engineer, which assisted my game start even more, so i was playing right away. i refined the training later of course, and guess what, i soon was at the stage where my training took precedence over my playing, because i was not training fast enough to achieve the results i needed even then. i was ahead of the game, wanting to do more, but suffering from a lack of skills to do it with. obviously i'm not talking about meta-gaming, but rather skill-based gaming. new ships, modules, tech ii guns and missiles, etc.. between 20 and 28 million sp, i lost interest in playing, due to skill training. when i start an alt with 54k sp, i stop playing right from the start, and try to get into it when they have achieved 10-14 million sp. so far, i've not succeeded, as i have no real connection to any of those characters, and little use for their skills or little interest in using them.eve has become a hobby for me, but not one i take a great deal of enjoyment in. it's just something to do, between working every day, and sleeping at night. when did that happen i wonder? no idea, but it was sometime after i got my old corp situated in wormhole space with the help of my friends at the time. all people i'd met playing eve, and not people i've known in real life. that first experience of eve was awesome, though i remember being a bit bored until that corp started rolling, gaining members, and actually doing something against uncertain odd's.that doesn't happen anymore. they're still there, but their success has nothing to do with me now, and even if it did, i wouldn't have the interest to log in. at some point, i became redundant, and that's when i lost interest. i had no unique skills, and even my t3 production science alt, was outdone by 2 or 3 other members. i had little or no place in pvp, as i was mostly indy trained, and i was but a ship among ships in wormhole sites. even as the ceo, i felt they had surpassed me, or any real need of me, and i'm sure they felt it to.then i looked again at eve, and realized i was just sp grinding."
5/12/2011,would caution strongly against boosting new characters above 10m sp on go. that would just allow for more goon recruit 100 noob swarm tactics. sp should be earned. make it more user friendly for noobs but not handed to them on a silver plate. they have to earn their place. if they don't make it then they should play some other game. the last thing the game needs is more guns in childrens hands.
5/12/2011,"the concept is good, but i am not sure about the execution.yes ok from a fleet fight point of view 'knowing' what you have done will 'eventually' actually happen is is good, but from a gameplay point of view its still unplayable.you will still experience the same lag, same slow down, the fights will take just as long if not longer. do you really want to see some jittery screen? or will it actually be really sloooowwww, and if so do you even what that either?it will kill the game, from a gameplay point of view imo, do i really want to go into a fleet fight, wheres its supposed to be fast action, fast pased, everything and everyone going mental, to something thats dreary, slow and cumbersome..no..sorry i dontyes for now, in support that its a 'temporary' measure. but i feel ccp will just implement this and it will stay like this.i think personally these are the problems1) badly coded and non performant modules that need looking at2) database queries and transactions need some serious love3) is python the best language to use? rather than c++ (i know some changes are happening)4) but the biggie for me is are we kidding ourselves thinking that eve one shard universe can actually work? isnt this why many other mmos have more than one world you can play one? are ccp trying to keep this 'look we have a single universe game' but infact as eve hasnt constantly grown this is just not feasible anymore?"
5/12/2011,thank you for your support!
5/12/2011,"i'd like to see negative icons effects working just like the targeting brackets. you can set the icons vertically and where you want on your screen. they would be a bit smaller than target ships, and they would display web, scramble, weapon disrupt etc.."
5/12/2011,sure - just remove the no targeting delay bonus and replace with a covert cloak. the only one with both is the sb - a paper thin frigate with weapons that suck against other frigates so leave it that way.
5/12/2011,you are a ******. black ops ships have always needed a covert ops cloak. i support this thread.
5/12/2011,"say that was true, do you think the game would be better if bcs were able to warp cloaked? it was a bad idea when it was first proposed all those moons ago and since nothing significant has changed ..give them better ability to 'support the troops' through specialized ganglinks, refitting and ammo hauling .."
5/12/2011,ccp is scared to death of making a decent t2 battleship. their whole 'we want tech advancement to matter' philosophy has all but disappeared.give us a t2 bs that is worth a damn. not all of us are wanting to be capital lag generators.
5/12/2011,"no, we dont need a cloaking solo pwnmobile."
5/12/2011,"we allready have, its called t3's, they can even warp trough bubbles aswell! something a slow bs cant do. ps its realy easy to decloak a battleship in a bubble"
5/12/2011,"ok let me break this down for you on the pre-nerf black ops recieved when it was released:1. shield, armor and hull were reduced by 25% from their tier 1 counterpart.2. the lock range was reduced by 25% from their tier 1 counterpart.3. the power grid was reduced on some of the black ops compared to their tier 1 counterparts, which makes for fitting issues.4. the base resistances were never given a proper t2 resists like the rest of t2 ships compared to their t1 counterparts.5. their base jump range was 1.5 light years if i remember correctly.i am sure there is a couple other things i have missed but the only thing ccp has addressed to help black ops out was add a fuel bay and increase the base light year range to 2.0. thats it.yes i understand it is a role boat for covert bridging and i am fine with that, but the other pre-nerf stuff compared to their tier 1 counterparts needs to be lifted. also have a look at the ship bonuses to help balance them out and make them a bit more useful on the battlefield if the pilot chooses to put it on the front line instead of bridging. the sin is an absolute disgrace! then, they will have a higher survivability and offensive capability like what people want.adding a covert ops cloak as some golden bullet to fix black ops and calling it a day is just plain naive.and yes, i do fly black ops, i just mainly use my alt with a covert cyno on a recon and use this character to do the bridging."

5/12/2011,"right, you do not know what is considering greifing with in the context of this game."
5/12/2011,"thanks cheeky and danika.seems like a tough problem to solve then, (as many in the thread before have mentioned)but what exactly does the scammer gain? besides causing wasted time in manufacturing for the mark? (i'm going to assume that the traders will be smart enough not to hit in the asks just to fill the suspiciously too-good-to-be-true order.)"
5/12/2011,"fairly simple.some guy with margin trading iv/v and piles of isk buys up all the ""garbage"" on jita sells, creates a buy order for 500k each, sets a minimum quantity orders of magnitude beyond what anyone would actually have, creates an item exchange contract for a ridiculous amount beyond the market value of the item, and empties the remainder of his wallet to an alt. they then spam the item in jita local for hours until somebody gullible enough to fall for it buys it up after seeing the ridiculous buy order.you walk out with 1 billion isk minus whatever the useless items cost you on sell orders, the other poor fool walks out with, well, garbage.i'm sorry, but if you're dumb enough to believe that someone is buying up useless items for a price that is way beyond what is shown on the market history, i hope the scammer puts your isk to better use.the skill is used for legitimate purposes moreso than not. while it's a bit sketchy to use what is a ""trusted"" game mechanic like the market to scam, it's allowed. forcing characters into a negative balance would be akin to creating isk out of thin air. even if you couldn't biomass after going into a negative wallet balance, accounts can easily be disposed of. plex is amazingly cheap."
5/12/2011,"there are a couple alternative suggestions here that i think could use being put forth as ""fixes"" instead of pursuing a removal.being as ccp has been easing things for newer players, this removal might happen if an alternative isn't found. as such, perhaps the market folks might put up a working fix vs such a suggestion as this and see if it can be pushed through instead.seriously - ""no! no! no!"".. that didn't save a few things we've seen and this is exploiting a game mechanic. it might just get ""fixed"" in the easy way - removal - and some of you point out it is important to how you do business."
5/12/2011,"thank you andski!okay i'm off then fence now. and very against this proposal. if people are dumb enough to fall for ""too-good-to-be-true orders then they deserve to lose their isk. i'm a trader and very against removing this legitimate skill"
5/12/2011,i'm honestly only against it as i like graphs and i dislike when people mess with my graphs. i do think the best solution would be a mark to show that an order cannot be fulfilled.this way at least the scammer has some element of risk.also less jita local spamm is also a win.
5/12/2011,"in principle, i agree with you. (the principle of making it harder to use as a scam), and i even like the idea of marking the order as non-fillable, but in practice i think that would be very technically difficult to implement. it would add a lot more lookups to check for fillability at each refresh of the market data, which would burden the system. not to mention it would flucutuate with the wallet of a user.somewhere else somebody suggested having multiple wallets for users. that would be a start. then we can have the margin account which must be filled with a buffer of isk. if that buffer goes below a certain level, you would need to fill it up else your (top) order will get auto-cancelled successively to replenish it up to min levels.this should make it close it how it works in real life. but you still have the issue of not enough isk on fill of the order. if we are not going to allow - isk, amounts (because of other reasons that people stated) then along with the existing fine, why not make a standings penalty hit with the station corp? make sense as you are losing 'credit' with the station market. you recall that the broker rates depend on the standing with the corp. do it enough and it will penalize the scammer.doesn't help your graphs though, sorry :)"
5/12/2011,up!
5/12/2011,my proposal was earlier on in this thread. :) can you read that and let me know if you see any potential problems with it? (about 20 posts up) same page (4)
5/12/2011,"""kind of"". only those who are towards the top end of sp invested in the skills will take a hit in their income. those coming up will find they have far more options than before, those options are available sooner and they pay out better.if you can access l4 agents for a corporation, all their l4 mission agents are available for use. same with l5 agents and you'll make as much lp as anyone else doing those missions for those agents.as such, it should help more players make more lp than before but some will take a hit. this ""more getting"" should far exceed the number ""losing"" and that should prevent an escalation in the value of the lp.-- all told it's a mixed bag (as usual). some get smacked, some get helped and in the future few will remember that it was any different. just like learning skills and those who lost at the ""all 5's"". that was a hit too but you don't see it discussed much."
5/12/2011,"apparently all the agents will be set to +20 quality.negotiation is still in game but it is not sure if it do anything (it don't work for r&d agents and it is fairly hard to check if it do something for other agents as there are too many possible changes in mission payout between tranquility and sisi).so lp payout will be reduce for the people that had trained the special connection skills to a high level and it will be increased for the players that hadn't trained them.a nerf to top income, a increase to minimum income."
5/12/2011,"i don't see where you draw that conclusion from, if you're running with a q20 agent (like 99% of players), your lp rewards are getting nerfed. end of story. even if you only trained 1 relevant connection skill to lvl1, you're still making less lp. as said, this is less of an issue for lower level missions as their pay is principally in bounties/loot. it's really only significant for lvl5, fw lvl4 and pirate lvl4 runners. and that's what i see as the real problem. it substantially reduces overall pay for these higher risk activities while barely scratching the low risk high sec missioners."
5/12/2011,"true rothgar, the only guy that will get more lp than before is the one that hasn't trained the connection skill and hadn't get a enough standing with the agent to get an increase in his true quality. on the other hand that is the situation of almost all the guys new to level 4. just to confirm it, negotiation don't affect the r&d payouts."
5/12/2011,"around low and 0.0 and pretty much all systems where dead...and this was as peak time..why, because being in a system is boring as hell especially in the middle of nowhere, why live there?so what are the csm or ccp proposing to bring life into these systems? like colonising or something. i think there needs to be real interactivity in eve, it just doesnt feel 'alive'and yes im sure people will say..well in space its dead. well firstly this isnt real life, its a game and new eden is supposed to be a colonised universe, its supposed to be full of life.surely we can bring more random races, npc, nebulas, npc ships flying/travelling through space rather than around a belt or gate etc etcplease bring life to eve.."
5/12/2011,"ever sat at a gate camp for several hours only to kill a shuttle? if you can't find anyone, it is because you didn't go to where the people are. the people are in the space worth holding. the rest of it is just junk filler space that no one wants.would it be nice to see stuff flying around? yes. is that the problem? no. the problem is that most of low sec and much of null sec is worthless space. why isn't anyone in those systems? because there is no reason to be in those systems."

5/12/2011,"retooling the jb system isnt that bad. i mean ships w/ jump drives is long over due and now you have to use a gate to get to the next bridge, it makes roaming more fun since people wont be traveling from pnqy to 6vdt w/ only 1 standard gate jump. i mean it's a 10 jump route so you can see the issue. plus test wore out the bridges so i can see your ire."
5/12/2011,...this pretty much sums up any other reply i could think up.
5/12/2011,"honestly, with the anom change, there's less isk in most of null. with the bridge change, it will be harder to move minerals in for these large construction projects. the proliferation should naturally decrease simply from those changes. a couple alliances in the west are going to be rolling in supers more than they already are, because those changes didn't effect them much. but, for the most part, there will be fewer supers. wonder if there is a freighter hauler/escort bot? if there isn't already, i expect there will be one soon."
5/12/2011,"sc numbers have grown 150-200 per month the past year, it may slow down a little dues to logistics concerns but it will be a drop in the bucket.hell, last i heard some people didn't even bother with minerals at all but bought carriers and reprocced on site for easy materials .. that little trick won't change so all that will happen a slight price increase to where they were prior to dominion (15-17b)"

5/12/2011,"naval and land warfare has used mine fields to deny access to certain territory and help in the defence of an area. if i recall correctly, a mine does actually exist in the game in one of the missions (don't ask me what mission, it was a good while back). so how about the introduction of a player usable mine? give it a detection radius of 2500m - 3000m with the damage of a bomb and can be anchored in place like a secure container. usable only in null sec (just like bombs, unless they can be used lowsec as well). as for proposed detection mechanics, could use a leaf out on how pos guns work with enemy detection.ideas or suggestions on this?"
5/12/2011,there used to be mines in eve (before i started playing)but they where deactivated by ccp (you can still find some mines/bpo's on contracts some times but they are not usable)the main reason why they where removed was lag too much mines on gates cause massive lagg and what happens if your mine kills someone while you are in high sec ?i heard that you got concorded when that happenedi don't think we will get mines again
5/12/2011,"ah, fair enough i was unaware of them having been a player item before. also as i mentioned, would keep it as a low and nullsec device like bombs are"
5/12/2011,"they used to exist apparently, but there's two issues.apparently aoe damage is vile for server health, and any decent mine field would lag the hell out of the grid on load... making it even worse. part of why it's an exploit to drop 50 gsc's around a warp bubble to stop cloaking."
5/12/2011,"currently there is a way to invent ""augmented"" drones using elite drone ai. i propose to put in a new item, something that can be attained, like an elite drone ai that allows an inventor to invent a pirate ship. for instance, gila is a combination of caldari and gallente technology adapted by guristas. for invention, use a caldari cruiser blueprint such as moa, and a gallente cruiser blueprint such as vexor, plus the ""elite rabbit ai"".another example would be rattlesnake: combine scorpion bp with dominix bp, plus more of the ""elite rabbit ai""the only question is where do you obtain the ""elite rabbit ai"" and how rare is it (should it be?)perhaps these drop in certain anomalies, or appear as loot in some pirate faction missions."
5/12/2011,should we have invention for every faction mod too? not supported.
5/12/2011,"show us on the doll where the evil missioner carebear-type person grinding pirate faction missions touched you inappropriately.//edit: yah, i'm doing the meme wrong, but why screw with the profit of other people when the stuff already drops / is obtainable through lp?"

5/12/2011,"i saw the advert for the quafe thing at the login screen for the game, and it got me thinking. if the character in the advert can wear a quafe shirt, why can't there be ones for the other ones, like fed navy or spacelane patrol? my idea is that t-shirts or jackets that can be worn by your character can be purchased in the lp store for a certain amount of lp points. that way, you won't have to do a micro-transaction with real money for the shirt, just your time and toil with missioning and getting lp points.as for what purpose this will serve? maybe you just got 10.0 with roden and want to show the universe that you have carebear pride? maybe you're roleplaying a caldari character that is one of those megacorporation types and wants to show where your loyalty is? or maybe you just think one of corp logos look cool. the shirts would be a purely vanity and aesthetic item and have no impact into giving the wearer an extra step above. if this gets implemented, perhaps a way to put player corp and alliance logos on t-shirts for your character could happen, but putting this in for the npc corps seems easier.being a vanity option, if ccp have other priorities as far as rebalancing the game go i'd prefer those ideas be kept at top priority, but this sounds like a cool idea to put in once all the big stuff has been taken care of."
5/12/2011,i petitioned your name because it is offensive to have a gallente named fdr in eve.
5/12/2011,i couldn't get a caldari to look like fdr. :p(that's what you mean right? )
5/12/2011,something like that...
5/12/2011,"yes but can you move ships in your blockade runner? (no, there isn't enough room) then what is missing is a ship setup that can move at least 2 packaged ships with reasonable chance of gank proof in emp space. make that available and i don't see the current situation as a problem.but i do still support the destruct cargo hold.i don't think that an orca should be the only one to have ""not stealable"" cargo."
5/12/2011,"i like this idea. this could prevent hot pink space craft, which is my biggest fear when ship painting is discussed. i can't forget everquest's armor temper... hot pink warriors fighting dragons definately took the game back a few paces.this skin idea could be the ticket. the editor could check to make sure the main colors of the craft could be screened. that way i could have pink or yellow on my ship, but the main color would have to be something more metalic.the skin/paint editor could have preset colors for the main ship, then more colors for decals/decorations. anyway, i like the idea of changing the look a bit."
5/12/2011,because i forgot to agree with my own idea doh!
5/12/2011,**** the haters. i want a neon pink rifter.

5/12/2011,"i don't surport this, it will add my lag to the game."
5/12/2011,"like the idea of decals, could add corp emblems, or like suggested nose art... but the dreaded pink, or the color palette threw up on the characters armor from eq did suck."
5/12/2011,"confirming bots did not exist before plex...:serious:you need to understand two things. first that plex was an idea to make it possible for the hardcore to feed resource to the casual so that the causal would not go outside the game to purchase resource(isk). second every game i have been in has had some level of rmt activity, even dead games like aoc. policing efforts only go so far, so i agree with the previous poster ccp need to change game mechanics so that the bot become drasticly vulnerable or unable to adapt to changing enviroment. allowing botting will absolutely murder the game in every shape."
5/12/2011,"while i don't approve of botting (rather i am in favour of making automated mining part of the gameplay) i still haven't heard any real substantial arguments on why they really are bad for the game, apart from the obvious one that it's sad for the people putting their time into mining.but then again, why would a sensible human being put their time into mining? it's not fun."
5/12/2011,"interesting idea: make it based on the least expensive regional average.and yeah, i thought that people would want the forge, but remember: it's prime real-estate, and the regional mayor is free to set tax rates as they see fit. they might decide to increase taxes in the region for many kinds of reasons. one reason might be because the cost of making changes would demand a premium.or that the average amount of commerce could invite more incursions, but that's going outside the scope i'm aiming for."
5/12/2011,"sounds awesome, especially the fact that it would allow us to set rediculous tax rates to get all those carebears out of highsec :p"

5/12/2011,"what do you suppose would be the result of changing concord intervention to being chance based depending on the sec status of the system.for instance in a 1.0 system there would be a 100% chance that concord would intervene as it normally does for any criminal act but as you go down there would be a lower chance 90% in a 0.9, 80% in a 0.8 an so forth strait down to a 10% chance they would show up in a 0.1 sec system.any individual action that currently causes a concord response would have its own chance unless there was a concord ship currently on the same grid as the violator in which case there would be a 100% chance of response.there could be a way for a fc to ""hide"" the actions of his fleetmembers so that larger gangs would not always attract a response.i would say that the ships/guns at stations and gates would stay as they are so that there would still be limited mobility for those with low personal security status.in addition to that you could train skills to increase/decrease the chance of getting a concord response and/or use deployable items like ""distress beacons"" that could be targeted by a pirate but if they activate they have a chance of calling for help. alternatively a pirate could deploy a ""dampening fields"" that would help hide criminal actions.just pontificating and figured i would see what others had to add to the idea. believe me i know how much this would change things for those who rely on the current high/low sec divide."

5/13/2011,"the drake uses guided missiles because assault missiles are netirely useless, and see no benefit from skills like guided missile precision or like implants. the reason it's the only one, is becauste the rest of them only have two launchers at most, and a more effective use of high slots is to drop in neut's, rather than fit an unbonused launcher that's applying dps that is less effective than a nos."
5/13/2011,i completely disagree. pve and pvp balance should always be considered for all ships and weapon systems. i agree that no ship or weapon should be relegated to only be useful for pve or maybe even just pvp.if missile velocity is capable of reaching 11kms why is it still sub 6kms? i agree that cruise missiles need this buff but light and heavy are probably fast enough already. however i am going to stick by my guns on the flight time reduction of all guided missiles. some more than others (heavy and cruise over light).the sml needs a rethink fitting requirement wise and the whole t1 frigate line up needs a complete rethink and rebalance. the tier system is terribad and hits frigates the most.

5/13/2011,from devs answer your every question [answers] yes drone assembly arrays need to be bigger - have you ever tried to put in a 30 day run of a t2 original medium drone - not enough room.also component assembly arrays - you have to micro manage them if you are building cap ship components
5/13/2011,you have a good point on the component assembly array but your reason for th drone asembly array is a bad one if you have a t2 bpo get used to shorter runs like all those who have to run inventions to build t2 drones
5/13/2011,can't you build your drones in a station?
5/13/2011,fairly certain not every single player in the game has access to standard station services.
5/13/2011,"invalid argument - nearly every bulk producer likely to hit to the 30-day limit is based in empire space, and has access to hundreds of slots within a 5-jump radius.that said, i don't think this alone is a good enough reason to buff arrays. component arrays are an interesting case - they're already nearly as efficient as chas for storage. i think a better solution would be a component array with 20x the capacity, 5x the slots (or a bonus to build time for capital components) and 10x the fitting requirements, or something along those lines."

5/13/2011,wat
5/13/2011,as multi role corporation wie have difrent projects and difrent finaces for them now its big mess and need use eve alts to hold that meny seperated.
5/13/2011,ahhhh the ancient language of hibberjiberish lucky for you guy's i'm an expert at translating it.translation: not for characters but for a corporation 7 wallets and hanger sections are not enough. it would be a good thing if you can add more divisions to your corp wallet and hangers.translation: as a multi role corporation we have different projects and different finances for them. currently it's a big mess and we have to use alts to keep the money separated.ow and i support this.
5/13/2011,"totally a good idea. and perhaps a way to designate a certain % of income to be distributed to each division.for example: each time i complete a mission i receive x isk. i want 25% to go to my casual expenses division, 25% to my savings division, and 50% to my strontium funds."
5/13/2011,"thanks for the translations warzon3!as a character, i too have different projects with different funding. i have a pi thing in which i want 100% of the proceeds to go for plex at the end of the month. i have wh ops in which i which the funds seperate of general income. i want my own wallet divisions, and it isn't too hard to do.hell, i'd love to have multiple hangers also. currently you can kinda do this with station containers, but it's not the same and very clunky to work with.multiple wallet divisions for corporations have help a lot, now it's time to think about characters."
5/13/2011,why stop there? add the ability for multiple characters to share the same wallet. add that and i'll give this idea a thumbs up.
5/13/2011,suported it should be same with hangar too i mena we should have division in hangar instead of being forced to use container to put order in our stuff
5/13/2011,"no, the idea of eve is that you need to know exactly where you are warping (need 100% singal on it) to warp there. you have to actually been there before (bm) habe someone bee there (warp to fleet memebr) or it has to be other object that game put there (anomaly) if you allow people to just warp anywhere they want, whats to stop them from warping 100000au from sun?"
5/13/2011,have the pilot loose a level in his highest sp skill when the supercap is destroyed.that is all.
5/13/2011,...how would that make a difference? please don't post if you aren't going to put a minute in actually defending your proposal.i fail to see this would actually nerf scs though. they would need to die for this to be effective. which they don't... not often at least. you would still have people like pl that will still continue to stomp people. so yeah... this idea. makes no sense. =/
5/13/2011,"clearly the more appropriate course of action would be to award sp to a super capital pilot when his/her ship blows up.seriously though, yeah, making a group of already incredibly resilient ships have an sp-loss-on-death drawback is only going to discourage brazen use of them and force players to use even more conservative strategies and fittings (read: just bring more and spider tank harder)."

5/13/2011,"as far as i have noticed there are new social skills buyable from lp store... like... ""security connectons"" which gives you 10% more lp payout per level. i am surprised that you have missed it.of course i am still talking about sisi"
5/13/2011,"i saw those too, they are new additions that didn't exist when the previous posts were made. so our previous speculation that they were nerfing lp payout turned out to be premature. the new lp skills give a 10% bonus per lvl and only one is relevant per agent class. the new skills are rank 2 (old were rank 1) and are for sale in the appropriate lp stores. the price is slightly higher than the old lp skills, though not doubled as you would expect.so with this new information, it looks like an across the board buff to missioners. all those crap quality agents are now just as good as the others and it certainly opens up new areas as potential mission hubs. this will likely turn into a lvl5 lp buff as well since on tq all agents are q12 and on sisi they are allegedly q20 now. it also reduced standing requirements for all agents. they are now set at q-20 standings requirements i believe."
5/13/2011,"personally i just think there are enough players in eve who would like more small gang pvp such that if ccp just 1) let us know where plexes are being taken, and 2)removed the rats, enough of that crowd would join fw and we would have constant combat. i do realize that the number of people who claim they want good fights is much higher than the number of people who actually do want good fights. however, even if we figure that of the 35,000 that are on average online at any given time, there are 2000 indeed looking for good quality small gang pvp. i think at least 10% or 200 would see that fw gives you notifications of others looking for good pvp fights within a few jumps. so fw would end up with roughly 50 people per faction who are looking for pvp in these plexes. now you only need 8 people to basically cover each front. that means that even with these very low estimates there would be allot of good pvp fw that you cant find anywhere else in eve. once people started having some fun with this the numbers would grow. they would not only grow in the current community but more importantly eve would keep many of the people who got tired of waiting for blobs to form and/or spending their whole time warping around looking for fights. since ccp never really set up a mechanic that promoted small gang pvp i do not think there is any telling how popular this would end up being. its really an untapped population since eve as it exists now involves so much down time no one in their right mind would stick with the game if they play it for pvp and only have short amounts of time each day to commit to computer games. i really think if ccp did those 2 changes they would have 600,000 subscribers in 3 years. they would have to add the pirate factions and maybe even other factions because fw would be so popular."
5/13/2011,"as i said somewhere in that terrible, terrible blog comment thread, we were told about the changes before the blog went up. some folks on the csm were in favor, some were opposed. we did get some changes made, mostly in the timing of when it would go live and the expanded fuel bay.contrary to some popular belief, we don't get veto power over what ccp wants to do. we do give them our opinions, and sometimes they listen and sometimes they disagree.personally, i think this change was a good thing, people whining about not being able to move around 0.0 in perfect safety makes me"
5/13/2011,"define ""dead"", please. the systems were totally empty beside your gang?there was no one in the easy to reach spots (belts/gates)?there was no one that you could probe?seeing that ""lol.. seriously it was only a few of us..like 4 canes, no ewar no logi"" i bet it is the last one as you had no prober. so ""dead"" mean ""there was no one so distracted to be a easy target and no one was interested in coming out and hunting for us""."
5/13/2011,because nobody just roams around low or null sec aimlessly unless they want to die or hunt. everyone is in stations and high worth assets are in guarded locations deep in alliance territories. if you want activity emp trade hubs are about the only place you'll find it. i don't see a problem with this.

5/13/2011,"just because something is good for a particular player, doesn't mean its good for the game - if a dev spawned a trillion isk into your wallet or a sabre bpo into your personal hangar (or mine) would you say that was good for the game as a whole too?that isn't a good thing, because one of the pillars that eve is based on is meaningful combat where losses have value and consequences attached (unlike other mmos where the material cost of getting killed is essentially zero and so pvp only matters for bragging right purposes). if i get my battleship/hac/titan/whatever blown up and my response is 'lol whatever' because macro-miners have crushed the mineral market to the position where ship loss has become meaningless, where has that aspect of the game gone?that was one reason for the insurance nerf a little while ago - t1 ships had become more or less free because mineral prices had crashed so far that the hull costs were at the same level as the insurance payouts.as above, any pvp entity engaged in combat suffers from bot miners because the crashed mineral market dilutes the value and meaning of a kill. if i kill some wardec target who has lost battleship after battleship without a care in the world because bot mining has flattened the market and cushioned the blow, why even bother? you're right to say that one reason why people bot mine is that mining is mind-numbingly terrible and no human being in their right mind should want to do it, but the solution to that is to make mining interesting, not sanction those who cheat."
5/13/2011,is this the only information we are gonna get about the meeting? i can not find another post about it.
5/13/2011,"in the discussion surrounding the recent announcement of changes to jump bridges, it was mentioned that there were significant differences of opinion within the csm on the desirability of these changes and in terms of the way they approached the issue, with some being strongly in favour, others taking a hard line against, and still others being opposed but taking a softer stance and trying to negotiate a compromise solution. since the csm discussed these changes with ccp on private forums rather than in documented meetings, the general playerbase can't see which approach and position was adopted by individual csms, although this information would probably be of interest to at least some of their voters. to remedy this, i request/suggest that the individual csm members who participated in those discussions briefly express their position on the change, in this thread or on some more high-profile platform."
5/13/2011,"i won't devote hours to looking through that terrible thread, but i am pretty sure most of the csm posted with our personal opinions in there.my view on things like this is that it is up to each csm member to decide to make their positions known. if someone doesn't speak up, you should take that into consideration when voting next time."

5/14/2011,"big stuff tends to be able to crap on small stuff a bit too easily in serious fights. this issue extends from supers to frigates. a small sig and speed just isn't that much in the way of protection for the following reasons:- larger ships have larger range so tracking doesn't matter much when they spread out. how about changing the angular velocity portion of the turret equation to perpendicular velocity.- a good tracking situation can compensate for a bad sig radius ratio or vice versa. - neuts- drone bay flexibility (little to no cost/consequence for bringing a wing of lights on many ships)the limitations on concurrent bomb usage greatly limits the effectiveness of bombers against t2/t3/capital targets. those ships already have much higher health for their sig radius and that's enough of an advantage for them against bombs.with the jumpbridge changes, capitals are going to become considerably more mobile compared to sub caps and iirc, in the dialog from late last year where grayscale was talking to the old csm about bridges and such, it was noted that capital mobility was also an issue. shouldn't these things be addressed at the same time?good luck with your push to get constant balance iteration; ccp is way behind the times and their competition on this matter... it's high time this happened, we're rooting for you!"
5/14/2011,"all ships should be balanced for pvp, and pve should recieve the benefits of advanced ai, and be brought up to spec for pvp. that makes pve content better, and insures that all ships are equally effective in both arena's.while i agree that missiles should travel faster, reducing time-to-impact, i think your perspective is a little skewed. it takes a little more work, than simply adjusting the velocity and flight time, as changing velocity will change missiles usefulness in pvp. specifically, at 11 km/s they will catch even interceptors with mwd's travelling at 5000 m/s or better, while that vessel is seeing a 500% sig radius penalty and quite likely being target painted. after that, the only thing to reduce dps is explosion velocity. i would assume changing this also means that the physics engine would have to be adjusted to account for the additional velocity somehow, the same as onboard targeting systems, or guided missile control systems would have to be adjusted to account for higher velocity missiles and reduced flight times and fuel. obviously their is some leeway here, given the dynamic nature of skill, implant, and other effects on missile velocity and flight times, but the faster it travels, the faster the physics engine has to calculate adjustments to speed and direction.let's talk torpedo's. explosion radius on a torpedo is 450 m min., with rage torpedo's being around 650 m. a megathron has a sig radius of 485 m, while a typhoon has a sig radius of 320 m. highest and lowest of the armor tankers respectively. armor tankers don't have their sig radius increased by any means outside of fitting an mwd, which means that outside of skill use or implants intended to reduce a missiles explosion radius, battleship class assault missiles are suffering from the inability to apply fully dps against ~half the available battleships in that fashion. coincidentally, the signature radius effect reducing skill and implants only affect guided missiles, and have no effect in this case. meaning that torpedo dps is significantly reduced against most battleships unless they're shield tanked with extenders or using mwd's. now let's look at explosion velocity. 61 m/s for rage, and 71 m/s for all others. the slowest battleships are the rokh, (500 m; 89m/s), and the abaddon, (470m; 89m/s). this means that torpedo's are ineffective against even their own class of vessel, and of more practical use against something larger. ironically, they are generally most effective against caldari ships, which tend to see increased sig radius as a result of shield extenders; though plate might slow down an armor tanked vessel enough to remove the effect of the lower explosion velocity on others.*cough* bs *cough*"

5/14/2011,so long as it's like stations where the original name is still there?
5/14/2011,"supported conditionally.1) the static catalog number should always remain, with the renamed version appended to the end after a semicolon, such as ""74-ytj; rattingville"".2a) the renamed version must not match the static name of any other solar system (or, at least, not match the static name of any solar system held by npcs).2b) the renamed version must have one capital letter at the start of each word, all other letters must be lowercase, only one space in-between words, letters and numerals only, and no leading or trailing spaces. this is to avoid similarity loopholes with 2a, above."
5/14/2011,"this gets brought up a lot.the problem is you the have to have some gm sit and babysit people naming systems, or you're going to end up hearing the following on comms:""ok, we'll fly through crusty vagina, hot drop into my left tit, and then kick their asses out of poopsack""leaving the system naming to ccp. outpost names are bad enough as it is."
5/14/2011,problem would be the same as allowing full choice in ship colour schemes:time to p*n*s would be zero.
5/14/2011,not supported
5/14/2011,"no. absolutely not. never going to support this.just looking at naming conventions for alliance built stations and pos, should be enough to prove that this is a dumb idea."
5/14/2011,sounds awesome i am supporting it. jump into poopsock system

5/14/2011,what do we all want?personal hanger divisions for sorting our items !!!
5/14/2011,"give me the option of ignoring worms when exploring. they share signature size with most low-sec exploration sites and one can spend hours rooting them out before any actual fun/isk can be had.streamlining the process:create a specific and sticky thread with a very strict rule and its own dedicated moderator.- whenever a proposal is raised and supported by 4-5 people, posts mentioning it is deleted and added to first post.- raising issues already in main post or in old 1kthings threads is considered spamming (this is the strict rule).- when 100 issues have been identified they are sent up the chain, thread is locked and a new one opened. sticky maintained for reference as 'old thread' (see above).don't think there is any way to do it that doesn't involve a lot of leg work or having to deal with sheer chaos."
5/14/2011,"standings requirements for agents disappear if it's high enough.so you have no idea if the corp/agent standing is enough in case your faction standings take a derived hit (yes, i know you can work it out or look it up)."
5/14/2011,"faction standings gain/loss needs to be balanced. currently, this system results in a general loss of standings with npc factions across the board, and no gain of npc standings except with one or two factions, by completing cosmo's, storyline, and data center missions, which also result in harsh penalties to other npc factions. i'd call it ~90% loss to 10% gain for npc faction standings. personally, i think this is rediculous, and see no reason why a player should suffer enemy of state standings with 1 or 2 factions, (not including pirate or npc variant factions), to have relatively good standings with another, losing the ability to enter various security levels of enemy faction space as their standings decrease, diplomacy skill or not.this should be changed in favor of increasing faction standings gain, without also losing npc faction standing elsewhere, in some missions, increasing the opportunities for npc standings gain by awarding it in all missions, and decreasing the loss of npc standings in general. the current system is a deterrent to mission running."
5/14/2011,"read the whole thread, but all that has to be said was already said on page 1:as for the topics that keep coming up, it seems that everyone agrees that the dramiel is op and then tries to come up with reasons why it shouldn't be brought in line with everything else:-balancing by cost:would be ok with me, if the price goes up significantly-you can kill poorly fitted/piloted dramiels:i find it silly to balance ships based on the lowest common denominator. the problem is that you can't kill the good pilots with other frigates, which would simply avoid your scram/web/ab af's if they want to and murder everything else. a single ship shouldn't be the best af and the best inty in the game.-don't nerf it, boost other frigates:nerfs are not a bad thing. they are a good thing. things will never be perfectly balanced and when something gets too strong or too weak it needs to be adjusted. ideally, one would have an equal amount of boosts and nerfs. trying to boost every other ship in the game to compensate for one of them being op'ed is, in my opinion, very silly. you then end up with power creep and creating more imbalances in the process, since you can't do it perfectly. do the other faction need a boost? maybe. but first it is important to bring the dramiel and line and see if the other frigates become more viable."
5/14/2011,1
5/14/2011,support
5/14/2011,"i might actually be worried about that aside from the overwhelming not-support you've recieved, the general crappiness of your proposal, and that i wouldn't care if it did. as i said previously, pink megathrons garner more support, i'm not concerned.that and i finally gave in to temptation and looked up your killboard deaths and gained the very unprofound understanding of why you hate pirates so much, near as i can tell you attempted (repeatedly) ratting in very bad places with very bad fits. among my favorites were a stealth bomber fitted with warp stabs and a megathron with a large repper but no resistances, there were others... and everyone gets a couple newbie deaths, but seriously... you really can't go blaming the pirates for your mistakes, it's part of the game. that or you can build up an irrational hate of pirates, fly into a state of permanent rage, and take up the hobby of suiciding mining ships with battleships(lol?) as you seem to have done."
5/14/2011,"lots of little problems with it and, without massive reworking of many game mechanics, very easy to bypass.i put 1 trit on the market for 1 billion isk. my alt buys it. i use contracts. so on and so forth.if you try and prevent this, then you block ""general"" buying and selling being as the buyers, sellers and contract types would then have to specify who can and cannot accept their orders - by sec status. talk about overly complicating the market and contracts systems.if you did do all this reworking - now i make a bunch of trial accounts, use ""disposable"" alts or what not then trade with the ""new char"" and get my -10 his sec status back without spending large chunks of time ratting.let's not make things easier for those who do get their sec status trashed via some transfer mechanism so they can buy their way out of trashed sec status."
5/14/2011,"since you are thrilled to have so many replies, i'll add mine.it's a bad idea, addressing a problem that doesn't exist and the solutions to address it are onerus to the programmers and easy to circumvent.in short, no matter how many essays you write debating the finer points, your best case scenario is to end up with a turd wrapped in shiny paper. if presenting this idea could teach you one lesson, it should be that when its been proven to you beyond reasonable doubt that it is a poor idea, you should drop it and move on."
5/14/2011,"1. and how long ago did these deaths happen? because unlike me, u've never set foot outside high sec for a long time; looks like u're the one who let them scare u out.2. the difference is i'm not scared to take risk, unlike u. i have more than 10 times the kills u have, even though i inevitably have more losses; of course, that's part of the game as well. u obviously wouldn't know it since u're too scared to take a loss, judging from your own killboard. might wanna finally find the courage to get out of high sec; maybe then u'll have a reason to talk about your own killboard instead of crying about someone else's.3. u wanna compare lol losses? let's see, u lost a ratting cruiser, battlecruiser, oh and my favorite? u lost an assault frigate to a mining ship in high sec; and that one was pretty recent. 4. fyi, suicide ganking is pvp, just like low sec pirating, especially when it's the same person's alt being ganked. not surprising that u can't comprehend the simple concept of gathering intel; u don't even understand the purpose behind a warp core stabilizer fitted stealth bomber and your experience with pvp only involves camping high sec trade hubs with a fleet because u're mentally incapable of anything else and so u can't handle any less safety than that.anything else u wanna whine about? in either case, plz continue crying about killboards because yours is even worse and u know it, despite a fleet babysitting u in high sec. revision: lowest sec status applies to every alt in the account and trading them between accounts makes both accounts take the same sec hit.even though they still have to continuously spend real money to sustain this (which is good for ccp anyway), thx for bringing that up.last time i checked, suicide ganking isn't a problem either but apparently, the -10s can't handle even the slightest risk to themselves."
5/14/2011,"anna, i think you need to go take your meds."
5/14/2011,"1. i've gone outside highsec, not really done much though, mostly wormholes really and none of this is surprising considering i'm into industry.2. it is amusing how according to you i'm both scared to pvp and a murderous -10 in disguise, make up your mind lol.3. cruiser; shopping in lowsec, happens(i find it disturbing however that you see a not-fit cruiser as a ratting cruiser). battlecruiser; this is my favorite death ever, took the guy 5 alts and 3 hours to take my completely disabled but not-webbed low skilled myrm down, i was lol'ing the whole time, would do again. assault frigate; yeah, the 'mining cruiser' was anti-frigate fitted, gave it a try, it was close, would do again. there, i talked about my own killboard, but yours is moar funny.4. fyi, you don't have to use a battleship to gank mining ships in 0.5... you do so because you're awful. warp core stabs lololololol.fyi, you realize you've now- claimed i'm obviously a self-interested murderous -10 in disguise opposing your ideas to protect myself- claimed i'm afraid to pvp- claimed i camp trade hubs with a fleet- failed to realize the above are mutually exclusiveisn't it strange how i'm barely active in pvp and i'm often in a trade hub... if only there were a profession to explain this behaviour... oh wait.... there is, durrrrrrrrrrr. oh well, it will forever remain a mystery to those who suffer from being braindead, these may even be the same people who think warp stabs for combat are good somehow, or who use battleships in suicide ganks on mining ships in 0.5. perhaps i too should should lemming crappy fits into low and null over, and over, and over, and over again to become a pvp pro like you. now after running all the crappiest fits i could think of to their deaths (repeatedly), i'd better waste billions of isk using battleships for suicide ganks that cruisers can easily pull off, like a baddie who doesn't know what they're doing. perhaps after i've done these things i'll be a pvp pro (and awful) like you.i also like long walks on the beach, puppies, and butterflies."
5/14/2011,"extreme examples, like yours, make it look obvious. i'll put out another example:i buy up all the dread guristas diamond tags on the market in sinq liason, everyshore, etc... i then place a buy order, at 1.5 million each in amarr while putting the contract up in jita. the amarr order isn't for ""100"" per, only 40 per order, 720 units on the order - a number that means they might be using them for lp bpc's type stuff or datacenter turn-ins, etc. but also a number few are going to have ""on hand"".so our ""stupid sap"" trader, sees 626 for sale on a contract in jita at 1 mill each and a buy order at 1.5 mill. a nice 300 mill profit for a ""normal"" hub-to-hub run.all told, the scammer paid about 70 mill and walked away with 626 mill for a couple hours or so ""gotcha!"" work that would be extremely difficult for most traders to detect - you could pretty much buy out every last one of those tags, on all markets, like this to score a nice hit.the ""garbage"" for billions scam is kind of obvious. but specialty items that suddenly come into demand, like a batch of criminal tags... not so easy to spot and very easy to scam even a seasoned player who knows what to look for.my little example can make a scammer some solid daily income -'casual' scam style, not ""a billion an hour!!"" but a fairly solid, steady income with a little research on the markets. it's a game mechanics abuse issue. not some ""if you're smart enough, you can avoid it"" issue."
5/14/2011,yet another great idea.i'm not for or against scamming i just really dislike it when they make it harder to sort through the legitimate stuff.like all paying player most of us just want to get along with our business at let you play with your toys but the point where you make me spend an extra 20 minutes a day overlooking something to make sure it's not a scam not a new market opportunity is when i start getting annoyed.
5/14/2011,"it's a good idea, but it doesn't get around the problem, the scammer can easily just leave little or no money in the account, that way he can't even afford any units of the item.what about this -- along with the existing fine when you are hit with insufficient funds, you get a mark on your record. each 'mark' on your margin record reduces your effective margin trading skill by a penalty, say 5%. marks on the record can be erased by time, (for instance 1 day without any further margin incidents will erase one 5% penalty.)this should make successive violations of margin trading non-economical, and still be fair to the legitimate users of the skill."
5/14/2011,"supporting becuase it is not how margin trading works in rl , and it sucks."
5/14/2011,1
5/14/2011,"why shouldn't they be able to?i actually think having the ability to quickly set a warp point through an interface like that used for probe launchers would be nice. how do you think they explored the galaxy in the first place? has it occured to you, that using a telescop to look at a far away system, is also a means of setting that destination as a location to travel to? you can determine distance, travel time at velocity, and any number of other factors, to make that opoint your destination.i'm suggesting a balance between that and nothing at all, which is what we have currently. drop a probe, or even three, send them to a position in space, cycle them once, and they send you back a 100% signal on their location so you can warp to it using current mechanics. i think that's pretty reasonable."
5/14/2011,"concept, increase skill points gain when online and useing said skill being trained, example: mineing- if i am online and mineing, and training a mineing skill, increase skill points gained by x amount. if i am training missle skills and running missions were i am shooting missles, increase skill points gain by x amount."
5/14/2011,i too would like to encourage and reward the use of macros.
5/14/2011,"if they want to use macros, then they deserve to get shot by pirates"
5/14/2011,sounds like a great idea maybe we should add mount as well.i cant wait to ride a giant space turkey while i do my instanced 10/10 complexes in my throax with level 70 gear. seriously go back to wow
5/14/2011,omg please tell me you are an alt for the op. because the look is creepy similar.
5/14/2011,"no, im not, but i do know him"
5/14/2011,"so i've been thinking, yes that is a dangerous thing.the problem with super carriers is one of two things.1) their jump range it could do with a nerf of which i'm not going to talk about why.2) fighter bombers are too cheap which i will be as this is the biggest problem.as everyone should of noticed their are many people foaming at the mouth about super carriers as you can see by the number of threads about them.however i cannot fault their current design they work and the problem is that they work which makes it hard to find fault with them.so i took a deeper thought and went hang on how much do the bombers cost?to my surprise the value is about 20 mill each now consider the introduction of the carrier/mothership, remember that they were given fighters which had about the same ehp and dps as a cruiser.then there was the whole overhaul of capital ships and the mothership lost it's name and super carriers gained fighter bombers.these nasty brutes have 4 times the damage and 2 times the ehp of a standard fighter yet effectively making them into a battleship yet they cost 20million.so this simple derp in maths has caused the issue with fighter bombers being so overpowered not because they do extreme damage but because they are not worth killing.you loose 25 fighter bombers in a super carrier that is nothing really, 500 mill they can farm that back in a day.so i propose they change the fighter bomber costs to be inline with a tier 2 battleship so about 100 million+ per unit.also if this was implemented to stop people exploiting it to make a quick buck all fighter bombers not in a super carrier's hanger would be returned in it's current mineral value. (lets not have another pi disaster)"
5/14/2011,:wtc:you looked at the supercarrier hull and decided that the two things that made it overpowered were jump range and the low cost of fighter bombers?both those things are way down the list of 'why supercarriers are broken'.
5/14/2011,"i dont think i know any super pilots that ""buy"" their own fighters or fighter bombers... if you're annoyed/worried that they 'cost' too little then instead of ramping up the price ramp up the material cost, which tbh would ramp up prices too.maybe making fighter bombers become t2 fighters, requiring t2 materials to make could change the attitude to keeping fighter bombers alive. even so you'd probably see large alliances create reimbursement programs to replace for their super pilots."
5/14/2011,"well they need to make it worth killing the bombers.if bombers cost next to nothing and yet do loads of damage and have loads of hp.currently you would be wasting money to kill bombers and that makes them not worth killing in the first place.if killing them made the super carrier pilot think twice then they wouldn't be as over powered as they are now.and yes i don't think the ehp is the problem , the problem is that the weapons they possess are cheap and far too effective."
5/14/2011,"if i could make one change, i would make the loss in security status a more significant hit. example: tonight, friend o mine was heading into motsu, he gets blown away, yea, concord blows them away, they loose a 70k ship, they get a million in loot, ok, no problem......... the problem is they do it right in front of the so called police, should that not result in a huge loss or is concord the most corrupt police department in the galaxy?the results of this, would be a reduction in piracy right in the middle of the major trade hubs, and the constant offenders would soon find themselves expelled out of the empire."
5/14/2011,i suspect that this game might not be for you
5/14/2011,"wtf is this?!?!? why would you want to reduce piracy?!?!?!?!? roflif any change is needed, is to reduce de security penaltys, so i don't have to do rat all the time."
5/14/2011,"you already take a huge security hit for high-sec piracy.problem is that the suicide ganker will go to the limit and then spend a day in perfectly safe null nap-land resetting his security and be back in motsu immediately afterwards.easy solution is the one proposed by a veto member (you know, real pirates ).limit security gain to low-sec rats.suicides will still happen but repairing security will no longer be something you can do semi-afk, and since recycling characters to 'skip' the security hassle is a bannable offence ...ps: the dev q&a thread alludes to unprobable ships going byebye so the tengu swarm will never happen (most common objection to the idea)."
5/14/2011,"add it to your watch list.gank him with your main, put your smartbomb alt on top of it. f1 smartbomb before he's ship pops.profit, revenge.have a nice day."
5/14/2011,yes
5/14/2011,"it's lose, not loose.crap idea / poor troll. pick any two."
5/14/2011,"not sufficient fix by itself, but in combination with other changes sure."
5/14/2011,+1 would read again.no problems with mittens and i am not a goon. it is just amazing to read all this.
5/14/2011,"i don't think making mining fully-automatic is a good idea, as this would lead to a total market crash. this, however does't mean i don't think mining should be changed.imo a compromise would be to give mining barges and exhumers the ability to only automaically move goods from their cargohold to another window, for example a jetcan or the hannger off an orca. that way they either had to jetcan-mine or have a hauler with them. this wouldn't be a huge challenge for well-organized groups of players while still leaving them somewhat vuernable (""see that afk-orca? let's wardec them^^"").or force the player to choose between max yield and afk-mining -> make it a high slot item with heavy cap use only fittable on mining barges/exhumers.all this won't really fix the macroing though, as it would still be more profitable than legit afk-mining.run a script through the server logs one dt per week to look for ships doing the same actions in the same intervalls for hours."
5/14/2011,modern bots are much more sophisticated than this (ccp is catching some of them and working on the rest anyway).
5/14/2011,"given the nature of the meeting (almost all of it was nda voice discussions about the summit), there is nothing else to report."
5/14/2011,"it's generally a good idea to have some knowledge on a topic you wish to speak about before you start speaking on it. in this case, i would highly recommend you read up on concord response mechanics, specifically related to the relationship between 'high' and 'low' security space."
5/15/2011,"not quite sure this problem is only in this topic. i believe the new forums were supposed to fix a lot of problems, but it seems they were not tested properly.seems to me a basic problem the forums has is the advanced search functionality. there is no advanced search functionality. you can type commands into the search box to make the search more complex, but you have to know what you are looking for to find it in the first place.if all you do is type a keyword into the search box, returns will contain that keyword. but identifying if the forum post can help you quickly and simply would require more text area for each return of text for a keyword match.obtaining no results for a keyword search should not also clear the search text box, requiring continued searches to retype the entire keyword combination. this would allow faster editing of the keyword(s) and command(s). also, listing the commands available for use in the search window would also be very, very helpful. below is the list of commands i use:+ (plus sign) = keyword or phrase must be included in results- (minus sign) = keyword or phrase must not be included in results"""" (open/close quotes) = exact phrase/keyword to search forexamples: +""planetary interaction"" +""install a command center"" +moon +probe (did not match any documents)+""planetary interaction"" +""install a command center"" +moon +scan (10 results)might i suggest taking a look at the forums architecture? it seems slightly unorganized to me. with over 390,000 topics you would think a simple and straightforward organization method would be the number one priority aside from data security/integrity. might i suggest looking into some sort of top-down architecture, like a file-tree? each main root of the forum needs to have a full description of contents on the front page of the forum, including sub-section headings contained within it. think windows file manager in ""folder view"" with all the + plus signs on areas with sub-headings listed below; clicking all the + plus signs would show all. selecting a topic to read should be simple. is it possible to put the tree structure of the forums as a ""hideable"" part of the eve online main page? i.e. clicking on eve online, then eve forums, then forum index ("
5/15/2011,"i hate that after 5 years the game is still ""minmatar for pvp, caldari for pve"". i really don't care how it is fixed, but i'm getting bored of seeing the same 5-6 hulls all damn day."
5/15/2011,"train navigation and the speed of a ship increases, (level 5 abaddon achieves 111 m/s); train target navigation prediction and explosion velocity increases, (explosion velocity becomes 106 m/s). either way explosion radius remains 450 m for standard and advanced long range torpedoes, and 650 for advanced anti-ship torpedoes, so what is your point exactly?i am fully aware that with the assistance of target painters on your own or an allies ship you can make assault missiles functional, but it also applies bonuses to guided missiles and turrets. when was the last time you saw a battleship with short range guns miss another battleship?why don't you try formulating an argument that has some content, and actually uses a more convincing argument?"
5/15/2011,"the point is that the numbers that you so smugly quoted in your post were nonsense. it's also a form of nonsense to state that an abaddon travels at 111 m/s. it's eft warrior nonsense, posted by someone who see numbers in eft but is unable to apply them to the real game. torps hitting an abaddon traveling at 111 m/s requires that it a) is not trimarked, b) is not webbed and c) has been struggling up to top speed for a about a minute. this combination of events is so rare that basing an argument on it is nonsense. but even when they do occur, a torp with explosion velocity of 107 m/s does 100% damage on an abaddon cruising at max speed of 111 m/s, because the abaddon's sig is sufficiently larger than the explosion radius of the torp. so what was your point again?at this point you'll start blustering about other bs. here are the facts. all tier 3 bs, and all caldari bs, have sufficient sigs to receive no damage mitigation from signature from torps. ignore speed, that's what webs are for, unless you have too much space honour to tackle your targets, and don't you dare mention abs on bs. the other bs sigs range from 320 m to 420 m, leading to damage mitigation from sig of 29%, 24%, 18%, 11% and 7%. you seem to believe this is a crippling issue. but torps do so much raw damage - more than a neutron blaster cannon - and, with the luxury of selectable damage type, the resultant applied damage, even without painter support or standard crash, is completely satisfactory. and yes, i have seen a bs miss another bs very many times. everyone has. i can't believe that you said that lol.moving on to hams, well, they do full damage to all bcs, and to pretty much all webbed cruisers, so i've no idea what you're talking about. although the fact that you call hams their correct name of ""assault missiles"" makes me think that you've never used them, because nobody who has used them calls them their strictly-correct name because it's so confusing."
5/15/2011,"well, at least you answered with some degree of consideration this time.i deliberatly limited the factors with regards to the torpedoes, because not everybody fits reduced speed tanks and it simply wasn't neccessary. it's a control group, using only the factors that are present in every scenario. sure, under certain circumstances i suppose a bs could miss a battleship with turrets, and certainly they can apply reduced dps as a result of the various factors at play. i use the term assault missiles not to identify ham's, but the group of short range unguided missiles as a whole. that's what they are.the fact is, that sig radius plays an important role in many aspects of combat, whether it be pvp or pve, decreasing locking times, allowing for damage to be maximized, etc.. why do you think caldari vessels are generally so poor in pvp? it's an obvious problem, which many seem to fail to grasp. there are so many factors at play in eve and ,not-withstanding they are all calculable variables, it leaves a lot of room for balance problems. assault missiles have limited range, and you can't directly improve their explosion radius by lowering it.shield extenders increase the sig radius of vessels they are on, making them easier to scan down, faster to lock, and increasing the ability to apply dps to them with missiles or turrets.guided missiles outrange nearly every other weapon, yet they take long enough to reach their target at range, that it's usually destroyed before the first one hits in pvp.microwarp drives can make a ships sig large enough that a dread could hit it with near full dps.faction, complex, and officer modules are the only effective way of making a ship truly effective in pvp or pve; yet they cost so much it's not worth the bother. they are very nearly required for any operations in c5 and c6 wormhole space against sleepers, such that without them two cap ships, and 10-12 rr strategic cruisers and/or battleships are required to run a site in a c6, reducing individual rewards to less than 70 million isk per site, assuming the corp gets nothing.energy destabilizers make local repping nearly impossible in pvp, and even completely render afterburners, stasis web's, ewar, and other modules useless in short order.recon's can be used to such effect at long range, that solo pvp is near to impossible, applying ewar, painter's, web's and the rest, while safely out of range of neut's, and most common pvp weapons. you need a handful of everything, to combat anything, which means you have to have at least 5-10 guys to even realisticly approach lowsec these days, and even then you're likely to be outnumbered in some places, yet you can safely fly through fifteen systems in nullsec without seeing a single person.there's plenty of problems.i like how you can only throw 1-3 small drones in a cruiser, battlescruiser, or hac depending on which you choose to fly. multi-fit high's for turrets and launchers rendering both obsolete and useless? yep, we got that too!assault missiles bite."
5/15/2011,"going back to my analogy of bugatti veyron's and camaro's.it's actually not a bad idea. in lieu of a full rebalance, just change the bp specifications to increase manufacturing time and material costs on the ships that are considered really good, and reduce the costs of some of the others which are considered really bad, in the same way. drakes will end up being 60-70 million isk, putting them on par with low-end bs, and ferox will run in at around 20 million isk. rifters will probably be near a million isk, and bursts will stay down around where they are currently.better ship = higher cost.it's an alternative, though i'd probably prefer the rebalance."
5/15/2011,"i have to be hounest i did not read all the reactions.but if it's not already said,if ccp would only make it possible to offline/online/unachor/achor modules at the same time, or online 50 modules in 1 go (like copieing 50 pictures in windows?) it would make pos'es allot beter, i think that's the only option i would like to change on pos'es right now tbh.we fly in spaceships and shoot stations orbiting around planets up the air but our towers computer can't handle more then 1 task at a time? give us a brake, sitting 8 hours streight in a wh just to online a tower for your corp is a bit... well... redicilous."
5/15/2011,"no no no no no no!!! please, no!am i playin battlefield heroes right now? do i need to purchase blonde hair with blue eyes and a tatoo to look as awesome as my ceo?do i need to purchase uber guns or uber modules to have a chance to compete in a blob where i die anyway?the reason i play eve online is bacause it's not like any other game out there.eve online is a complex game for grown up mature people (well not always matuer :p)please don't give this game mechanics you would only use in games designed for 6 year old girlseve online dosn't need micro transactions to make it interesting, and if it's about the money for ccp. find a way to minimize the plex usages or whatever. (i don't know it's possible but it's just an idea)it will seriously affect game play and i think allot of players will end up leaving or playing less. we are not 14 year old spoiled english brads. we are eve players. we play eve for a reason, and it's defo not micro transactions.ps. i might have been reacting a bit over-date. but i was so against the idea i had to put my voice in heregreetings visione"
5/15/2011,definitely supported.
5/15/2011,"supported. and if ccp is looking at rebalancing ship sizes they shouldn't only look at supercarriers.yes the supercarriers are the best example, but there are allot of ships with a weird sizes, my golem is like as big as my harbinger... greetings visione"
5/15/2011,supported if the nidhoggur gets on the list as well.
5/15/2011,"unfortunately seems a lot of people neglect the importance of your proposal.i'm not trader not even industrial making dozens of contracts per week but has eve player who likes this game to become better every time i log, this idea would be awesome.don't loose hope, link your proposal in the industry/market topics, people will come support you."
5/15/2011,"thank you for your support, and your vote of confidence i realise that this proposal perhaps isn't at the forefront of people's minds when they think of things that could be fixed - hybrids come to mind - but, as you say, this issue is indicative of the underlying problems affecting the economic aspects of eve.as you pointed out, an industrialist setting dozens of contracts over the period of a week would find this lack of data sorely frustrating. as a professional contracts trader - such as myself - setting dozens of contracts a day, i am near to tears when i think of all of the contracts data that is efectively going to waste, all because ccp won't tie them into the api in the same fashion as market transactions. it would be so immensely useful plotting the course of one's business using this information, but alas, we have to make do with such crude methods as dragging and dropping finished contracts into notepad to create a record, and then tabulating by hand.as for your idea to link it into s&i (or even md), i would dearly love to do that, but i think it might get slapped down rather quickly by the mods for cross-posting thanks again for your encouragement!"
5/15/2011,"currently when it comes to frigates, it is:dramiel or gtfo!it should not be this way. nerf it already."
5/15/2011,"lordelfa is 100% correct.i do not support this ""nerf dramiel"" proposal.p.s.where's the 'thumbs down' option?"
5/15/2011,"fof fail so hard right now.supporting...fof's absolutely need a ccp review.as it's already been typed up, fof's are ewar countermeasures.if it's hitting targets like lco's and friendlies, it's completely useless.fof's should hit random targets, yes, but nothing inanimate or friendly.i agree with the aggressor only idea. it'll hit what needs to be hit.no reason to nerf the missiles damage or volley. you paid for the missiles and had them ready in the cargo. you deserve to have them function after you spend time reloading and activating. you're not overpowering fof's by making them actually hit something in an targeting emergency in pvp. you planned ahead by training, stocking, and loading them. why should they hit anything that isn't hitting you?"
5/15/2011,how about eliminating the 10 second reload time if you're switching to f.o.f. missiles? that way you can load them as soon as you get jammed.
5/15/2011,"it's an interesting idea but i think it breaks too widely from an rp perspective to be feasible. from what i can gather from the other posters, as well as agreeing with it myself to a degree, a change in targetting ability or damage would be more helpful.thoughts?"
5/15/2011,that only works if the drones are in the same place at the same time and if 1 gets webbed then it might not be.also some people split their drones as well.
5/15/2011,"i think having the floating damage scroll through several lines before fading out (similar to other games) would help fix it. with that, having drone damage a different color then turret damage would also help."
5/15/2011,"okay, steering the discussion back to the original topic and proposal, i'd like to post to consideration a potential fix to the ""contract 1 trit for cash"" loophole.what if the the price for contracting to private toons were not fixed at 10,000 if the parties involved were of different sides of the law? instead they will be scaled up in proportion to how far away each of them are on the sec scale from each other? (exactly what the proposition is for the transferring of money itself.) simple and elegant fix to that problem. not to mention its consistent, for if we are to start 'taxing' cross secstatus isk transfers, then why not private contracts as well?so the next thing someone will point out is what about public contracts? no, we will not put fees on that. what will stop this being a loophole then? nothing really, but putting a public contract for 1trit for 1bil isk is putting the criminal at risk of losing lots of isk. it's sufficient deterrent that most won't bother, and hopefully we keep the flow of clean money in the clean economy separate from the money gotten through greifing means.economists will love this, because they will more accurately be able to track the money flows on either side, thus have better visibilty in which part of the economy needs more dev love.keep in mind, despite many people misunderstanding the point of my (original) proposal, this is not a greifer/ganker nerf request. this is a request for regulation of the money flows so that sec status penalty system is consistent and visible (to the devs), and an attempt at making piracy a self sustaining part of the economy and not a shadow meta-gaming market."
5/15/2011,"and you would do this by nerfing 'griefers' (i don't think that word means what you think it means) by banning them from using the market, using contracts etc etc.this is not needed by any stretch of the imagination. it is a terrible, terrible idea, and it would take an hour at most for it's intended target to figure out exactly how to get around it. you'd only end up ****ing off the casual crowd, not the hardcore -10 all lowsec all the time pirates.not being able to enter highsec is enough of a punishment. we don't need layer upon layer of overcomplicated, completely unnecessary stuff like this thrown in on top of it."
5/15/2011,"who said anything about banning?it's not nerfing anymore than tweaking insurance payouts was a 'nerf'. it's a tax. if you are moving mony between a -1 to a +1, its just a 2% tax. now if you think that's too severe a measure, please do explain.maybe i shouldn't use the term 'griefer'. it seems to carry with it too much meaning associated with people who deliberately want to make others lives difficult. i want to stop the good<->bad toon metagaming exploitation of the sec status system.you say making it hard for them to come into high sec is 'bad enough' but that only applies to <-5 status toons. why do -5<x<0 toons get off scotch free? in your view do you think they should? with these changes, a good toon moving 100mil over to his gank toon will pay ~5% tax on the transfer. i think that is a completely reasonable deterrent. (we can tune the exact %s) but the point is that they should be taxed. it's the cost of laundering your isk. if you don't want to pay it, then get your rich pirate friends to fund your ganking. not your own indy alt."
5/15/2011,"1. i can see why u've stuck with industry, or to be more accurate, u've shown why; u are scared to pvp.2. i've dispersed 0.0 gate camps as soon as they see 1 bomber nearby just because they can't handle a possible loss. and i've had low sec pirates docked and safespotted just because they knew i wasn't a carebear from their exhumer loss. so yes, they r -10s and at the same time, scared to pvp, just like u. what have u done? besides a few easy ganks, nothing really.3. ""shopping in low sec""...and in a cruiser too and u're calling someone else a baddie. as for your battlecruiser loss, there were only 3 involved so l2count--it helps with adding so u wouldn't have to pull numbers out of your ass like before. as for anti-frig fit kills, take a closer look at my killboard. it may take u a while to scroll through kills u'll never get, but it's there on more than one occasion; perfect for pirate wannabes like u who think u've got a guaranteed easy gank. and what difference does it make if your battlecruiser loss took 23 hours or 23 seconds? either way, u still lost it, only it's even worse in your case because instead of self-destructing, u chose to wait out those 3 hours like an idiot and still managed to pad someone else's killboard. so looking at your killboard, when will u do it again? at this rate, oh that's right--never.4. and u don't have to hide behind a fleet to get killmails--oh wait, u do have to because that's why u're into industry; u're awful. as for mutually exclusive, feel free to refer to #2. as for the trade hub camping, it can be done with high sec chars as well. glad to discover the existence of alts for u.it's a profession that u've been scared into because u're scared to pvp, especially without a fleet to hide behind; grats. and that's from your crappy low sec ships and fits; in fact, that 3 hour loss of yours would've been prevented with the same warp core stabilizers u lol about, since u're too stupid and incapable of taking a loss to self-destruct. epic fail. so here u r back in high sec so go ahead; suicide gank an exhumer with a cruiser and see how that works out for u. and if u can't afford throwaway cruisers, let alone billions as a self-proclaimed industrialist, then that makes u a baddie industrialist too."
5/15/2011,"anna, can you do me a favour?since you rewrite the proposal when we find a way around it, can you go through this thread and give us a summary of the changes you would like to see made to ensure this proposal works they way you want it to?"
5/15/2011,"so another completely ignored thread for ccp - grats. i wonder if there is some form of award for services to industry for ignoring customer feedback? back up your half-baked ideas with consultation, support it with data, and provide intelligent responses to points raised. until then, stop playing with stuff that you have demonstrated little understanding of."
5/15/2011,supporting the un nerfing of jbs.
5/15/2011,there is a well known workaround to this. *snip* spitfire some isk buy a high sp toon and supercap.
5/15/2011,"so let me get this right..you are *****ing about ""having"" to have 2 accounts to use a ship that:1. has an insane tank2. does a ridiculous amount of damagei would say its a fair trade. as far as ccp giving you back your ""wasted sp"", if you didn't know they couldn't dock, then you clearly don't know **** about super capitals and should not be in one."
5/15/2011,"op has obviously never heard of the term ""play balance"".not supported in the slightest."
5/15/2011,"if you have sc by your own, i hate you, i want you to die!!!we should remove 99% of sc's, make them impossibly hard to maintain and make them take 10 times the resources and time to build."
5/15/2011,"haven't read all the replies here, but figured i'd mention this. you do know players train alts and sell them on the forums for such purposes right? if you can afford one of those, you can sure as heck afford to drop a few billion on a holding alt, and put it in one of your free character slots. problem solved."
5/15/2011,"just as the title says, the nerf to how null sec survives and exists needs to be reverted back before its to late and it turns into a ghost town. we the players like the way null was before ccp interfered with null politics and how we operate. we the players worked long and hard through years to develop it into the place it is now. not only is it unfair, but for ccp to give in to the tear filled raging losers we destroyed using the game mechanics is just uncalled for.whatever happened to the sandbox philosophy that the game was built on? one thing for sure is; if we, the nc, fall it is only because ccp beat us. not to pl. not to drf. not to ncdot. not to anyone but ccp ruining the game.so let your voice be heard and tell ccp null is working as intended. thank you."
5/15/2011,bring back sanctums <3
5/15/2011,ccp sees large alliances as a hindrance to their goals and against the market. so i'm gonna support this.
5/15/2011,"this isn't going to happen and would just be a waste of csm time. ccp is formulating a vision for 0.0 and these steps are all taken to reach that goal, whatever it is. the time for objections was some time ago and ccp said they didn't see arguments they thought warranted a change to their current plans.your crying about fairnes and destruction of the sandbox are laughably bad and you can't really think ccp is going to take them seriously when every non-hysterical player can see you're just spouting bs hyperbole about two minor nerfs. i can understand you're butthurt about them, but it really is adapt or die time for you and no amount of whining is going to change that."
5/15/2011,"the anom nerf was hardly minor, there are whole regions without any worthwhile anoms anymore, but i do agree that it's better to see where ccp are going before whining.maybe if they'd bothered to roll out the nerf as part of the wider 0.0 changes, things would make more sense. then again, this is ccp we're taking about."
5/15/2011,i'll half support this. the jb changes are nice but the anom changes are not.
5/15/2011,"not supported, both changes were definitely for the greater good of the game"
5/15/2011,"the changes were needed, not supported."
5/15/2011,"maybe for your game, but not the game. i am referring to the game as a whole. that involves everyones experience combined. you on the other hand are being selfish and only thinking about what you want and like. do try and take a step back from malcanis land and take in the rest of the picture dear lad."
5/15/2011,"ha ha ha ha ha ha stupid carebear crying, i love this."
5/15/2011,i know it hurts poor lil nub but you do not understand. before sanctums before jumpbridges before warp to zero we all just did fine. the only benefit the above things have added is making it easy for scrubs to be scrubs. i believe eve online is the hardcore game for the hardcore gamer. there are a million games out there where you can have it all easy with no effort. let me point you to wow.tytia manny
5/15/2011,"the one problem i got is that large sections of 0.0 are worth less than highsec. jb are not realy needed that much anyways thanks to titan bridges and caps, but that nerf will make the pubbies happy.this nerf may hurt the drf more than the nc for they are spread out over more regions, but both have large numbers of titans that can be used for fleet movement.ps:(tinfoilhattime)ccp doesnt listen to csm. they want the csm to basically be public relations yes men to make everyone happy and spend more money on the game, and to take the blaim if something goes wrong."
5/15/2011,"you're right, titans need to be nerfed too. also, sanctum nerf is needed in order to shut off the broken hydrant of liquid isk that's ruining the economy."
5/15/2011,do you mean level 4 missions?
5/15/2011,pl troll best troll.so on a more serious note you made a troll post to make sure ccp reverse it for when you get sov. (lol)cool story bro.
5/15/2011,"no, i think they're doing it right. once your logistics reconfiguration is complete, you'll probably agree. maybe not, but if you don't, i don't care. obviously your attitude is completely skewed in favor of a me only perspective anyway.alliance tears; best tears."
5/15/2011,i see what you did there.
5/15/2011,safespots that are effectively unprobeable are bad.replace afk cloaking with 100000au safespotting.
5/15/2011,"i think that the op is using too many 'in story' reasons to justify this proposal. what makes you think that all original explorations where not done by warping to celestials? at any rate, any discussion in strictly story terms is going to inevitably turn into a enterprise vs star destroyer argument. game wise, what about this can't be achieved by simply being able to share bookmarks?the only thing you won't be able to do is to dynamically create warp in points without going there yourself, which i think is a good thing, as i sense that this can be exploited. you've essentially made all warp bubbling traps useless. good if you are the kind of player always getting caught in them, bad for those who use them. net-net bad for the economy and play balance. if your enemies spent the time to bubble up all routes in a system that you have not been in before, you *should* be caught, and not be able to just arbitrarily warp around to safe spots continuously.not supported."
5/15/2011,"as far as i know, it's not possibly to go 100000au from the sun anymore, if it ever was. i know players used to continuously log off to create distant bookmarks in space, and have heard of some ship being so far out, it would not be feasible for them to warp back. a bit silly that.the earth solar system is roughly 100 au across, with orbital ice and debris well beyond that, which is known as the oort cloud. the oort cloud is something which would be common to nearly any solar system, and may extend as much as 50au beyond the outermost planets. concievably, this could be used to prevent 100% scanning of 'safespots' beyond a certain distance from the sun. signal loss on probes due to interference from the oort cloud, could prevent scanning farther out for similar reasons.there are some very larger solar systems in eve of course. some of them being more than twice the size of our solar system. teonusude is a good example of this, and i'm sure there are quite a few others, so distance has to be determined in a dynamic fashion, being based mostly off a certain allowable distance from the outermost planetary object. i would say more than 20au, but less than 50au. it's probably already determined.any obstacles, interference, or ships in the area a scan is attempted would simply return a red result, with less than 70%, and quite possibly a random number under 100%as for getting around bubbles and gatecamps, i've done it many times, and no matter how much you bubble up a system, (barring it has all celestials beyond scan range from a gate, with no other means of detecting what is at the gate except eliminating numbers with regards to count in local and known player locations), it is possible to slip by.bubbles are limited in their ability to catch ships, and generally only fuction well from one angle, which means that you have to account for every possible warp in, and get them right on target. even then, you might miss that covert op's. this isn't an exploit by any means, and if it costs people a few tears, well i'm not disappointed. you might also want to note that a player has to drop these covert beacons as probes, and operate them as such, then place them where he/she wants them and run a cycle. until the probes are deployed as covert beacons on 100%, you can see them on your d-scan, and you will know what they are and why they're there. i'd say that's pretty fair."
5/15/2011,"i am a paying customer and have been for over 3 years. in this time i have lost many ships to unknown circumstances, everytime i petition i get the same answer, sorry but we dont know what happend and we are not reinbursing your ship... it usually takes 2-3 days for to be told that ;( recently lost my last mission ship and 3 days later still waiting to hear back ;( i cant afford to go buy new ship for missions while i wait on ccp telling me, they cant find a problem and they not going to reinburse my ship ;( if you want any form of cutomer support, dont hope for any from eve online,so from me alot and alot of thumbs down, and dont think will be telling friends or family to start playing eve onlinep.s anyone wanna buy a 3 year old 50 mill sp char will sell for <U+FFFD>2"
5/15/2011,cry me a river.
5/15/2011,the logs show nothing.and selling accounts is bad.
5/15/2011,"i've lost ships under suspicious circumstances. a couple i've gotten back, most i have not. i have always gotten a prompt, courteous answer. most of the time the reimbursement was declined, i was told what actually happened even though it looked suspicious on my end.once, way back on my original toon at about year 2, i was blasted down to a newbie frigate and a handful of cruiser mods i couldn't fit to it. end of game? pffft. i started missioning and ratting with that newbie frigate until i could afford a better one. that got me to a cruiser, then a bc, then back (eventually) into a battleship and my l4 missions. you always have the means to get back to where you left off... though it may not be convenient. i've been a paying customer for all 8 frickin' years of eve. here's to 8 more **raises a glass of quafe**"
5/15/2011,"this was spun out of ideas brought forth in this thread:petition of distrust against csm6but now as it is a proposal for a fix in the way csms are elected, it deserves a thread of its own. i suggest readers to familiarize yourself with the topic in the above thread, which brings to light the problems that we currently have, and the proposed solution below:-------why didn't more non-0.0 players vote and why didn't more non-0.0ers run for csm6?maybe they didn't bother, because they knew that (for example) given that only 2% of accounts are active in fw, then what is the point on campaigning on a fw platform? even if they did get all players in fw to vote for them, they won't dent the 0.0 votes.now if ccp dictates groups of constituents (based on a census or a survey of all players, and how each player choose to identify themselves as) then that would incentivize more minority players to run for csm (because frankly, who wants to bother if they have no statistical chance of winning?)for example, before the next csm, have a survey that all players are encouraged to fill out, which asks each player (1 per account)which best classifies what you spend most time doing in eve in the past year:1) pvp2) pve3) mining4) industry5) exploration6) trading7) corporate management/pie8) faction wars9) piratingwhere do you spend most of your time:1)empire2)lowsec3)null4)empire null5)whthat should bucket the population into groups which can then be assign a number of seats (depending on proportion).each player can then vote for a candidate for that seat(s). ie, players who are identified as null sec pvp, can only cast a vote for the candidates running for the null sec pvp seat(s).as an aside, i believe that any argument that a goon (or better 1+ goons) on the csm (sorry, i don't mean to pick on goons, just a handy example) is not biased is going to be flawed. even if they had the best intentions in mind, i doubt that a player that spends 100% of his time and experience playing in null sec is going to give the same mindshare to a suggestion that affects empire space or fw than one that is more familiar to them on a daily basis. they just may not have the experience in the other aspects of the game to be able to contribute as well as somebody who do spend all of their time there.this system is not without its flaws, but i think it would at least give a chance at letting the lesser (in terms of population) aspects of the game get some coverage and spotlight, and chance at improvement. it's arguable that those sometimes forgotten aspects are the ones that should get some more attention after all."
5/15/2011,"i support this in principle.my iteration of this idea was to make it geographical, but that would require some changes to the game."
5/15/2011,"ccp many times has said they wish to see battlecruisers flown less, they are more often then not the prefered choice of ship to fly for solo fighting for there damage and tank. it relative easy to get into a battlecruiser even starting off new.so instead of rather trying to nerf the battlecruiser variants of ships(ie the infamous nerf the drake threads so many months ago) rather the cruiser class could be boosted.the caracal is one example of this often used for anti-frig work with assault missiles it often excels in this type of combat but if trying to engage another cruiser it often dies in a horrible fire since it tank is relativily light. it can't fit ham's to engage cruisers as it will have no tank fitting hml's to it is a pain. i only use the caracal as an example as it is the only cruiser i've flown alot.my idea for a solution would be to change the racial battlecruiser requirments those i'd leave up for discussion and hopefully the decision by the csm and ccp.signedsilva"
5/15/2011,"agreed, look at the moa and osprey nobody really uses those a boost is much needed!!"
5/15/2011,"i agree with this one, the t1 cruisers are way too underpowered and only a selected few like the blackbird/rupture/stabber/thorax are good for combat vs other entities.../signed"
5/15/2011,"agreed, there are 4 types of cruisers in this game.there is the rupture, the arbitrator, the blackbird and the not a rupture, arby or blackbird.they should really put some focus on that last one."
5/15/2011,cruisers in dire need of reworking1. bellicouse2. omen3. moa
5/15/2011,"this is the complicated and difficult way round. and for cruisers, the problem isn't the drake, it's the hurricane - which is basically better than almost all cruisers at being a cruiser. the solution is to nerf all tier 2 bcs."
5/15/2011,commit tiericide and the rest will fall into line rather nicely.
5/15/2011,and exactly what play imbalance is this attempting to fix? or are you just asking for a handout?
5/15/2011,"massively abusable, dumb, adds nothing to eve, encourages macros and other afk activity.no."
5/15/2011,"sounds like a handout.and no, just because someone can go afk 23.5/7, doesn't mean they should get more sp. as far as more sp for certain activities. that's practically impossible. if you were to ap around the universe, wouldn't that mean you would get ship sp and navigation sp boosts? and yes, this would also be buffing all the drf bots, so no thanks."
5/15/2011,"no!!but rewarding the accomplishment of an epic arcs, rewarding a 10.00 standing corp, rewarding a 10.00 standing faction, rewarding a 10.00 all corps in the same faction, rewarding a 100% lvl5 skills set (ex full mechanic or whatever), yes."
5/15/2011,"yes, more rewards for bearing is what this game needs."
5/15/2011,"give each fighter bomber killmails, and they will be worth killing."
5/15/2011,"you do realize that people who can afford to drop 20b+ on a sc can easily afford to spend even 100m on fighter bombers, right?.... your nerf would be pointless.and nerfing the range? thats got to be the most stupid suggested nerf i have ever read. they already have a short jump range.. how about we leave supers alone and work on fixing dreads?..."
5/15/2011,dreads were fine until the supercap boost.why not make fighter bombers only able to attack structures and other supercaps?
5/15/2011,i think fb should be more expensiveand yes a sc cosr 20bil but if 1 fb costs 100mil and a sc pilot loses a whole set (25) he has to pay 2.5bil to get a new set he will think twice before launching them
5/15/2011,"well ccp have always stated that supers are designed to be anti-capital ships.there's always a struggle to make supers vulnerable to sub caps and i think the 1 way to do so is to make supers not able to field regular fighters but only regular drones and fighter bombers.although it seems very illogical that they'd have that restriction.so id say the nerf should be to restrict supers to carrying fighter bombers and regular drones only, and increase the material cost of fighter bombers to either 5x what they are now... or require the t2 components that a typical t2 cruiser requires.btw dreds are always designed as anti structure ships.. and thats why ccp are redesigning them into the the nuke-from-orbit button for planetary assaults. titans are just a massive step up from dreads, and i wouldnt be surprised if they end up having anti-planetary weapons too!"
5/15/2011,"no regular drones. fighters and bombers only.a wing of ogre iis will rip apart subcaps as fast as fighters, if not faster."
5/15/2011,the cost still need to reflect the ability of the drones.i admit that drones need a revise in regards to pricing but bombers really need to have a cost nerf.
5/15/2011,bump.is this going to catch the attention of any csm6? or should i just shelve the idea until the next csm convenes?
5/15/2011,luck?nope.
5/16/2011,i can't believe its been 6 years now and this still hasn't been done.
5/16/2011,"fleet command ships needs a +1 high slot, or -1 weapon high slot.why?because when you fit 3 gang modules, there is not enough high slots left to use all of turret/launcher slots, 1 remains unused. it's not because of dps, it's low anyway, but this is not right, when you need to remove 1 of the link to fit all maximum turrets/launchers.it's for vulture and damnation, at least."
5/16/2011,"and with that sentence, you just proved both myself and gypsio absolutely right that you are utterly clueless about anything to do with missiles.here're a couple of basic facts for you, as you don't seem to know the first thing about cruise missiles or missile damage reduction in general:1. a cruise missile max skilled trvels over 8km/s from a raven, and flys for a good 30 seconds. good luck outrunning that without overheating.2. now here's the bit that makes you look like an utter tool: that same raven firing cruise missiles at the inty is doing all of 12 dps. yeah, that's so game breaking.stop posting about missiles, you know nothing."
5/16/2011,feel free to check interceptors' bonuses.
5/16/2011,"they need to be able to be stolen. there is a lot of ""trash"" in wspace...anchored, offline towers, and modules that cannot be reclaimed by explorers or other less than savory individuals. maybe expand the codebreaker module and let these modules and towers be able to be flipped ownership so they can be recovered.the other pos issues are well documented. i like that link to the dead horse."
5/16/2011,"well, to play devil's advocate here, the orca will likely be using a mwd to increase it's mass while transiting the wormhole.of course the option is to be more crafty with the wormhole closing operation."
5/16/2011,"i approve this message.if you really want to move about your caps in relative safety you still have options:a) use station systemsb) set up a pos chain (infrastructure)c) move in groups and use cap transfers, logi, augorersto me a capital ship is more of less a flag ship / fleet ship. imho movement is part of the combat, like rl naval maneuvering. magically appearing on grid, unleashing your dps and then throwing a smoke bomb and disappearing again is a terrible mechanic. you want awesome power and a massive sword, you have to carry that sucker to the field."
5/16/2011,"great idea, would like to see ccp consider this."
5/16/2011,"sure, seems fair."
5/16/2011,"please offer this at some point. i know it is highly talked about and shot down, but combine it with very harsh terms and i doubt everyone will use it. #1 name change is final forever! one name change per account, not per character. #2 the character that had the name change can never be transfered to any other account. you are stuck with it forever. number three is optional and might not be needed, but maybe?#3 name change service only available after a legit character transfer to an alleged new owner number four is optional and might not be needed, but again maybe?#4 name change service must be paid with cc, paypal or whatever means ccp accepts that does not include plexname change service possible price could be $20 i would be fine with a much harsher price tag of $50"
5/16/2011,players: let us change our namesccp: we don't want players to be able to escape their reputationsplayers: so let players have a name change historyccp:
5/16/2011,"^^ this.name change would be nice, i would love to change my own name as well. it's been a long time so what i thought would be a cool name then has changed from now.and i agree, have name history and keep corp history. that's what people look at anyways. it's not like someone in the nc block going to recognize the name of some random drf member if they try to join their corp. maybe put in a dot or something around the portrait or name so players can see that they had a name change and if they care enough, they can easily check info on that player. hell, put in different view options to select what you can see if the person has a name change. such as the dot or some other symbol as just said, or even have it in parenthesis next to or below their new name.plus that means more $$$ for ccp."
5/16/2011,"#5 display original name option, ticked on by default, other players' original name is displayed to you at a glance instead of new name."
5/16/2011,"once a mission runner in their dominix hits gallente battleship 5 and sentry drone interfacing 5, there is nothing left to do except add rail guns and start training hybrid weapons. eventually that upgrade path will take them to a megathron or hyperion. no more dominix.alternately, start training caldari battleship and missile skills, fly a rattlesnake, end up in a golem.there are so very few faction/deadspace/officer drones or modules. where is estamels modified omnidirectional tracking link? or shadow serpentis gardei (with more damage)? or the dread guristas warden, with higher rate of fire?i want to see 35b isk drone boats, where the isk is embodied in the ""drones"" part, not the ""tank and rail guns"" part :)"
5/16/2011,"i vote yes for time dilation, and i am glad that the csm is making it their priority."
5/16/2011,"i'm so sick of people in pods or ships logging off right when i'm about to finish them off. i gate camp a lot in a hound. wt pods will warp in, i open fire, but they log off. i'm surprised this is even possible to begin with. eve online is all about real consequences for your actions, but this is such a weak carebear move, it's like something you would see in wow. if you log off, your ship should stay put for 15 minutes before dissapearing, no warp outs. there shouldn't be such an easy way for people to escape danger."
5/16/2011,"good idea, that way the next time you experience a power hiccup and your pc reboots, your enemies will have a few minutes to pee on your ship before they cram it up your ass./not supported. i understand your frustration man, but the current system is in place to protect you as well. it's an issue that is indeed exploited but removing it would be unfair to those who get disconnected for something not their fault."
5/16/2011,^^ this. go to null if you want to fight people that want to fight instead of griefing everyone because you are too lazy. :)
5/16/2011,they said the same thing about the bomber and cov op cloak for years and it was never truley fixed till they added it with a couple other perks. i would rather them get it right the first time. i also said add gank or tank not both. this would stop them from being in the front line imo. thanks for the reply. i like you range and fuel bay ideas.
5/16/2011,i don't see how you can compare bombers to b'ops they are completly different :smain point being bombers don't have a jump drive...
5/16/2011,"a covert cloak would be too much for a bo. i say this as a sin, panther, widow pilot. not supported.they are in dire need of some hp/resist adjustment, and if they get that then a covops cloak would be even more imbalanced."
5/16/2011,they are both designed in a stealth type role but did not have cov op cloaks. bos are made to work hand in hand with cov op cloak type ships.
5/16/2011,they are still one of the most expensive ships before capitals and least used. if we got the cloak and a buff to either tank or gank not both it would still not be over powered. they could still be countered and destroyed.there are so few options for smaller fleets to accomplish anything in this game. i think this would be a move in the right direction for what they say they want to do with 0.0.
5/16/2011,"put a covert ops cloak and a black ops, and it will become the standard ship to fly by all pirates in low sec. hell, even small scale pvp in null sec and high sec wars."
5/16/2011,"they would still be foolish to go toe go toe a vs a well organized roam even less vs a hellcat, drake, or bs fleet imo. we are still talking about a lot of isk here. this could be a nice new niche if ccp truey wants to open up small scale warefare and objectives for such fleets in 0.0 i am thinking long term if they add new objectives in 0.0. low sec id still take a fleet bs over a bo w/ cloak and a buff to either tank or gank. costs much less and more effective imo."
5/16/2011,i'm supporting this only because i love cloaky ships.
5/16/2011,"lol! like they would go toe-to-toe with a hellcat fleet. they would just stay cloaked and warp the **** off.put a covert cloak on it and everyone would train for one and fly nothing else. you say the cost is high now, but when the demand goes through the roof, all inventors will be making these and due to the price competition, they will drop in price. sounds good but when it is nothing but marco-polo between black ops everywhere...i hope you get the picture. if not, then there is not much else i can say to get you to stop seeing in tunnel vision."
5/16/2011,not everyone trains recons now so you saying all would train that is a weak counter imo. dps of bos is camparable if not less than a well trained bomber in most cases. bombers cost a lot less and will be traveling with them. i still see bos being more expensive than tier two bs by a long shot. bos playing marco polo is far fetched when bs that cost much less can kill them. people already play marco polo btw so this won change anything. just because someone does not agree with you does not mean they have tunnel vission. if it did i could say the same of you. i made the points i wanted to already.
5/16/2011,even if they [component assembly arrays that is] have mineral bays so only minerals can go in them it would be fine [if the where bigger].
5/16/2011,i suspect this would be tricky to implement. cf 'why can't i compress ore directly from the ore bay (of my rorqual)?'.
5/16/2011,that would still be unpleasant in a super or carrier.
5/16/2011,"it removes the annoying lag i get when i try to look at someone's standings to see if they're actually neutral or if it's an overview bug. that's a good thing.you can still check your own standings, but after it hits, i can't check yours. why i would have been able to in the past, i have no idea."
5/16/2011,"no. it's on a separate tab from your relation to the character. default tab is whatever you have open last time. it produces no lag unless you click on it. whatever overview bug you're referring to, if it exist, need to be fixed. you do not break something else for a workaround. in this case, the workaround works fine even if you don't break character info tab.i need to check standings of clients who may be afk. even if they're around, i can't ask them every other mission or take their word for it. also, you own standings info is bugged, you don't see standings updates unless you relog, so asking won't help."
5/16/2011,"default tab is always npc standings for me. it's not something i've ever looked at, so i have no idea why that is, but iut always opens on that. and please, don't doubt that the overview bug exists. i don't know why it does, but blues show as neuts on entering systems sometimes. i've lost ships to it before, and i've almost shot friendly caps more times than i care to think of."
5/16/2011,"that has to do with overall tab count. it's a separate issue. if you open the character info of someone with an additional tab, such as medals and achievements, it opens up that tab, even though you had relationships subtab in the standings tab open last time on someone without the medals tab, because it's the xth tab counting from the front. then, when you click on the standings tab, it defaults back to npc standings subtab. an easy fix would be to put medals tab at the back, or even relationships subtab in front of the npc standings subtab."
5/16/2011,"you won't be able to easily tell if someone is a frequent mission runner or pvper.currently, you can take an educated guess which of the stations in high-sec someone is likely to be docked in based on standings, and also work out where you can run to for faction police help if they start chasing you.""on a pilot's standings towards npc corporations""- does that mean someone's faction standings will still be visible? how about a corp's standings? (for pos setup)i'm going to reserve judgement on this until we know the reason for this flat removal, but it seems like removal of useful info for no real benefit.[tinfoil]maybe doing a background check on someone is something that is being moved to incarna?[/tinfoil]"
5/16/2011,"most of good pvpers are vets who's been around long enough to have standing records anyway. if you see someone without standings, it means he's a noob rather than pvper. mission runners will have numerous standings with numerous agents, you won't be able to tell anyway. viewable npc standings has been around for a long time, the fact that people don't trail carebears with it already is because it works in theory, but not in practice."
5/16/2011,fully
5/16/2011,"1. yes, because industry is obviously something that isn't a core part of the game, after all who needs ships, mods, and equipment? the true pro pvpers like you can do without, if only you could fit warp stabs on your pod.2. yes, people run in fear because you do really fail ganks on exhumers with battleships.... yeah... its on the internet it must be true!3. i still shop in lowsec. obviously there's no possible way more accounts could be involved in a kill then showed on the killmail, nowai!!! you speak almost as if i care o_o.4. shame on me for being into industry shame! its not as if its a perfectly valid thing to do or anything. how dare i play eve how the crap i feel like?! how dare i!? durr.i don't think words mean what you think they mean. them fearsome exhumer suicides obviously display your mighty pvp prowess to the enemy, run and hide! yes, people run in fear because you suicided exhumers... uh... that's not deluded at all, rite?and warp core stabs.... lololololololol.brutix tops. you even use battleships for mackinaws ... *facepalm*... and yes they can be done by cruiser no problem. perhaps you need to l2overload? unless you happen to be continually running across the most heavily tanked ultra-paranoid miners of all time... which you aren't, and even if you were, l2scout scrub.if griefers ever got embarrassed, they'd be embarrassed of you."
5/16/2011,"i still think your trolling/ are a far to serious role player/ got blown up in low sec/high sec by pirates.i think this idea is terrible and really dont get why you keep pushing it, i'd understand if it was a real issue that was currently making the game unplayable but it isn't.also last time i checked drug dealers and other illegal people pay the same if not less taxes as me so your point is invalid.p.s.even if this was a problem which it isn't it's a very very very low priority issue and not worth the though let alone attention you are giving it."
5/16/2011,"are you talking about my proposal or anna's add ons?well, you are entitled to your opinion, that's your right, and i do agree that it's not terribly high priority. but i have a vested interest in this game and it's unique economy from an academic stand point and i have other ideas to expand the depth of realism in the game but they all would involve the building of 'trust' in players. ( ask yourself why bonds can't work in eve right now -- because of a lack of trusted institutions and a credit market. ) so many things would be possible if the currency of trust were guarded. ( loans, bonds, stock market, futures market ) the broken money transfer system is pivotal to all these things. so no, it's not a problem ""now"" but it will become an issue later if we want to add these things. and if we don't. oh well. then some other game will do it. as for game terms in the here and now, am i the only one who thinks it's wrong that i was play a trustworthy model citizen, you may rub me the wrong way, so i go create an alt, give him 100mil isk. hunt you down and gank you, and have my good character pick up the loot, and then delete the alt?seems like that should have cost me more than the insurance shortage of a ship and some modules to do. but that's debatable. i'm mostly pushing this from a future value to the economy standpoint. it's low pri though, so i'm happy to leave this idea ferment a bit."
5/16/2011,"personally i say make the war dec's cost more. i'll agree with some of you that war dec's do get out of handwith people randomly declaring war on one another, war is alos important as to some extents it keeps the economy rolling and as some of you hvae said, nowhere is safe in eve, don't fly anything you're not willing to lose right?i only say make it cost more, because in reality, these wars would be insanely expensive, declaration of war shouldn't run you 100mil, maybe 10mil is a good starting place. if you up the price, you also make the wars just a bit more meaingful.while its true no matter how expensive they are, people are still going to declare war, if it costs them a bit more or they have to work a bit more to declare war, well that just shows that the corp or alliance came together and said, ""yeah... these sob's need to go.""only other thing i can thin of, is if after 2 weeks of war and no shots have been fired between the agressor and the dec'ed corp, why not null the dec or atleast make them pay a much larger fee to continue. i mean if you're gonna war dec, you might as well get out there and fight and die.those are just my ideas and opinions, anyone elses thoughts?"
5/16/2011,"a corp war dec should cost no less than 250 million isk. an alliance war dec should cost no less than 500 million isk. fighting wars are expensive and thanks to eve, anyone with an ******* and a couple of isk can file a war dec on a corp, then not fire a shot. there should be very stiff penalties for the aggressing corp that does not want to fight, but war decs everyone. example; let us sleep corp. i fyou are the aggressing corp and you haven't fire a shot at enemy corp during the first week, war dec fees double. if no shots are fired after the second week, war decs fees are again doubled, plus war dec is voided. if your not going to fight, then you should not be allowed to continually file war decs. that is the biggest problem in this game."
5/16/2011,"ok so what is concords deal then? for 2mil they turn a blind eye to a wardec. i call bull****. the concord i know and have been killed by, wouldn't give a damn if you paid them or not they would still smoke you and laugh. i had a wardec last over 50days in high sec. it was the most pointless 50days ever. . . ever. the wardec'ing corp would kill noobs during the day, and hide for 6-8 hours in station from the older players logging in. that having been said eve needs its wardecs and its dark, gloomy, god forsaken theme.now stay with me on this, concord for a small fee will allow aggression in and around a system, and for extra you can include other other systems, constilations, and regions. higher sec systems cost more to wardec in, lower sec systems would then cost less. this allows concord to 'monitor' and 'contain' conflict. but at the same time for aggressing corps that really have a reason to fight can pay the premium and have no containment issues. this gives the option for corps and alliances to fight over systems in highsec for any social conflict you can think of. it gives carebears the option of spreading out to make a wardec cost more, but at the risk of going solo. now you can still fight outside of the designated fighting zone, but you risk sec status taking regualar sec hits like you would in lowsec, still without concord intervention for either party involved with the wardec. that can be used for the protection of the defending corp, as well as for ambushes for the agressing corp.building the mechanic for ending the wardec via contract of some kind is a great idea.by charging more for a larger area to fight in without penalty would help keep pointless wardecs minimized."
5/16/2011,this proposal its agenst afk clouckers hoo its siting in systems like days end weeks duing noting just disturbind ppl live there they need to be nerfed to. my proposal its make like 50 unitsper cycle a heavy watter to run a cov -ops clouck.
5/16/2011,"this is a good idea in my opinion, cause afk cloakers are very nasty and there is no way to detect them. this would make the game more active if they have to check their fuel consumption"
5/16/2011,afk cloakers are harmless. it is when they are just normal cloakers is when you need to start paying attention.
5/16/2011,no afk clouckers are not harmes until they where cov ops cynos :)fuel means sortern time to get target or go away. so no siting stil in one system for days.
5/16/2011,good idea. this needs to be changed definitely since all other things have been changed in nul sec.
5/16/2011,the troll. it is meant to be on a diet.
5/16/2011,no that means more tinking how to use fuel not just hop in system and sit there for weeks.
5/16/2011,jesus christ shut the clouck up.
5/16/2011,may i direct you all to this answer by greyscale (halfway down the post).
5/16/2011,"quote from grayscale:afk cloaking?>> i don't know if we have internal consensus on this (haven't asked recently), and i know there's not consensus among the players (there was some lively discussion of this at fanfest), but i'm very much of the opinion that it's a problem that players need to be given tools to solve."
5/16/2011,cloakers are not the problem. the local tab that gives you a free warning a hostile is in system is the problem. remove local.
5/16/2011,"afk cloakers generate false intel , so they get benefits in game while being afk.i too would like to see 0.0 turning into barren wasteland."
5/16/2011,and how long would you propose a cycle lasts? would there be fuel bays on bombers/recons/t3s? what is the point of this?
5/16/2011,bump 16 may 2011
5/16/2011,"i am basically in support of this. i had just finished creating a similar proposal when i encountered this, see below.************the fair way of doing this would be to charge a plex or account fee for one month for each active training que. you are paying this already for the first que, the difference is that the ability to pay for a second que is fair to ccp, allows you to train an alt simultaneously, but you can only log into one alt at a time.it is effectively fair, and limits the total server load at the same time. heck, pay triple normal and train all three alts.point: for ccp, this is a clear win over a second account, since it gives two advantages.1 only one character is online on the account, server load is not increased.2 players avoid spending on a second account due to hassle, costing ccp potential revenue. if they are able to pay for a second training que on demand, that will be a convenient way to increase ccp income, and allow characters to explore secondary aspects of the game more readily.just my thoughts."
5/16/2011,"so you either have drone protection near you during mining or out at your container, or a little of both based on your skills. what about secure containers, another layer of theft protection for you, but if your irritating new pirate buddy has a hacking module and some skills (think an actual hacking panel pops up and you have to solve some kind of hacking puzzle that gets easier as your skills increase) say goodbye to those rocks. what about another tier of mining for those that dont want to go and get the ore right now? well, travel deep into the field and install a mining operation with real hired npcs that work it. they mine the ore and accumulate it and when they are full to the gills with ore a message is sent to you to come get the goods. now you have to fly your special asteroid field hauler down deep to get it. these mining ops would be a pretty darn good target for pod pirates also but again they would probably be pretty deep in the field and tracking sensors would not be so great penetrating all those rocks in the way. but still a very fun and challenging activity for ore theft pirates or those who just want to take out the whole operation. i sense countermeasure for the miners here and that would be another skill at putting up defense at your proud new mining op. i am also thinking some kind of manual flight fast maneuvering scan drones designed for asteroid fields would be a really cool addition for both miners scanning for ore deep down and for pirates trying to find you or your new mining op. one final thought, arent planetary rings supposed to be made out of rocks, ice, and various other types of debris? yea that is on the wish list also.i think that fairly sums it up at this point in time. i looked down some of the proposals at the eve csm and saw that there are a lot of fairly good ideas out there and fixes that could be made. you know repairs for simple ui stuff, however no one seems all that concerned about the basic fabric of the game. like the fact that ccp put air in space and that there is an up and down out in the void. so hear me, i am hoping that all players see and support my vision for a real space environment. if these issues are bothering me so much, deep down arent they bothering you to? we need to band together and let our voices be heard to get these changes made. my final question is: are we happy flying around in an unrealistic environment that our senses of reason never really fully buy? are we happy just jumping around to a limited set of fixed warp points? doesnt it all kind of feel hollow, i know planets feel real hollow when i warp or fly through them. eve is a great game, but i think with some base foundation overhauls it could be an incredibly immersive and exciting experience."
5/16/2011,stop spamming up the forums and put all of your wall of text in a single thread.
5/16/2011,"also condence your idea in to a single paragraph at the start, so people can see the basic gist of your idea and aren't forced to either ingore your thread or read a tiresome essey before they even understand what you're trying to get at."
5/16/2011,the hell if i gonna read even one your threads entirely.
5/16/2011,paragraphs are the new rage i hear.
5/16/2011,lolwut can someone put all this together w/ punctuation so i can read it?
5/16/2011,"i am sure that this idea has been brought up on several occasions, but i find it necessary to continue expressing this idea so that the possibility of this idea can come to life.i would like you to consider the idea of creating a system that allows to either scan down cloaked vessels, with considerable efforts of course or using special weapons/mods. it should be difficult to scan down a cloaked ship, or create a new weapon system which would, for example, explode in a given radius where you might think an enemy might be cloaked. for instance, a mobias missile would fly straight 25km and explode with a radius of 10km and anything cloaked wouldn't take damage but would be briefly exposed to other ships. this idea is spawned from the constant issue with rival corps/alliance members coming into a system, cloaking and going afk just to instill fear in others preventing them from ratting/mining/etc. there should be a method for tracking these ships down.if it works in other sci-fi worlds it should be considered in this one. <--- not necessarily true, however, i really do find it particularly interesting that there hasn't been anything done with anti-cloaking on a more high-tech level.the difficulty in scanning down cloaked vessels would be a mix of requiring particular skills in order to facilitate this action and the time spent scanning down the particular ship. in other words, rather than shooting out some probes and being able to get a general scan of the system, it would, for instance, require a pilot to scan down a general area where a cloaked pilot might be located, then to concentrate the probes in that certain location to get a more specific location of the cloaked target and so on, meaning that it would take considerable effort and time to scan down a cloaked target. the idea is not to nerf cloaking in sense, but like everything in game, there needs to be a way to counter it. the idea that a ship can sit in one spot in a system over several hours cloaked should be reviewed since it can be argued that even modern day physics could be used to conceive ways of detecting cloaked ships in space. while i won't go as far as doing that, i do think this should be reviewed considerably."
5/16/2011,"what, exactly, does it mean to be ""difficult"" to scan something down? do you mean ""high skill requirements"", or do you mean ""difficult from a gameplay standpoint""? because i can tell you, scanning somebody down with probes isn't exactly difficult, it's just a question of how much they're moving around and how small their sig radius is.the key question (and no, i don't have an answer) is, and has always been, what are cloaks designed for? if you can answer this, you'll be able to figure out if cloaking needs a nerf, and if it does, what that nerf might be."
5/16/2011,"so another super op ship that almost nothing can stop but can be moved through highsec. huh, thought thats what we were trying to avoid.a t3 frig or destroyer wouldnt be op just so highly specialized with its subsystems that it would be a niche ship. pros: a highly specialized ship that could be refit on the fly to counter everchanging battlespace. one ship with multiple subsystems, instead of 12 ships each with its own not cheap fitting. cons: such high specialization means inherent weakness in other areas, (oh wait, that's not a con, thats an op fix)"
5/16/2011,my god. a minmatar t3 frigate would be the only ship i ever fly... until they realize how grossly overpowered it is and nerf it into oblivion.
5/16/2011,from here
5/16/2011,"well, i think the new system ( that will go live on thursday ), is not bad, but a bit oversimplified.i suggest the following :5 quality tiers : qua -20 / qua -10 / qua 0 / qua 10 / qua 20this way you feel like having progressed when you go from -20 to -10 for example, plus you have to find a new agent and relocate, which is a good thing imho, more dynamic.still having only 5 quality tiers will result in more qua 20 agents and thus more spread out populations.i would remove true sec levels ( in regards to missions ) and only use 10 levels : 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0because otherwise, players will still find the 0.45 systems and overcrowd there, then nothing has really changed in that regard.end result should be to keep some flavor to the game, while still simplifying the system and spreading out the population."

5/16/2011,"no, because then everything would be essentially the same way before. tbh, it would probably just be better to just find a new agent that's most likely not too far to mix it up."
5/16/2011,"there has been something that has been bugging me; its like a little gnat that wont go away. i try to just forget about it and pretend that there is not a problem; just use your imagination i keep saying. but my senses and reasoning just keep at me and now i guess i just have to try and do something about it. i think that all of you will agree with me that this little issue has been bugging you also. i am sure to some they have just gotten so used to the status quo, that they have fooled themselves into believing this is normal and shouldnt be fixed. well what is it you ask, the big bomb that can and will change the fundamentals of eve for the better, and if you really think about it for the better. open your minds and really envision what eve could be with some very fundamental changes. it is this: emersion and a taste of reality. it is what we have all always really wanted, to feel like you are actually there in the vastness of space spinning out of control hanging on to your wildly maneuvering ship by the seat of your pants. just imagine racing through a vast asteroid field thousands of km deep fighting another pod pilot or npc with the consequences of hitting a floating rock at high speed ending in a wrecked ship. also imagine if you will, you are at full burn accelerating rapidly then you cut your engines and guess what you just float at a constant velocity, because the last time i checked there is no atmospheric friction in space to slow you down. it just makes sense to fix these little problems now that eve is over 8 years old, but wait dont fret, the point and click system will still be there for large complex ships that have a lot going on at one time making ship maneuvering difficult.so here is what i am thinking. remember, keep your minds open and let me entertain you. first off is to have a fixed camera pan-able mode that is somewhat representative of where the ships bridge or cockpit would be. this mode would also give the pod pilot a real sense of ship scale. so when you bank, yaw, and pitch around like a crazy person on fire, you are really immersed in the action. of course the normal camera modes that we all have grown to love so much would still be available, and frankly would still have to be available.so how do we navigate this ship that is not really and airplane flying around in the troposphere? ok, hold on, i am thinking 4 simple maneuvering modes (i almost said flight modes oops flying is what we do in airplanes not ships in the vacuum of space). these modes would include 2 combat modes and 2 free maneuvering modes. i know what you are thinking, combat will be so hard if you are falling all over the place with no friction to slow you down or help control the ship. well, we have the most advanced machines ever known to humans and they have control computers to help us out. lets talk about the 2 combat modes first because i am sure all of the point and shoot pilots are shaking their heads about now.combat mode 1: point and click almost like you have it now. great for large complex ships that take a multitasking mutant like all of you battlecruiser and larger ship pilots out there. you point and click where you want the ship to go and your ships control computer does all the work for you. there is one hitch though and that is speed control. thrusters wont work like you see them now, they will only burn when you are accelerating or decelerating. here is how this goes, before you enter combat, or during if you are crazy, you will tell your mighty computer what maximum speed you want under combat situations. you see ship mass and maneuvering thrust now becomes a factor as your speed increases, so a large ship just cant swing its large fat, well you know what i am about to say, around as quickly as a small frigate. it comes down to what is acceptable to you, as the gods of space, in turning radius and maneuverability for the ship you are piloting.

5/16/2011,why the hell you needed to spread this trash out over five threads we will never know
5/16/2011,"according to this, come may 19th the agent change will be implemented, fragmenting all the current agent divisions into their respective divisions. before i knew the specifics of the change, i was all for them, but now i'm probably going to augment my mission running strategy differently.i run missions for impetus (ikr lol) because i've looked through which gallente corp i'd want to mission for, and as i'd like to eventually go into exploration as well, impetus had a lot of agents in border space that had fairly good quality. however, most, if not all of these are either in the personnel or public relations division. the administration agents are in low security space for the most part.i could, but i do have quite a bit of lp accumulated from all the mission running, and it would be grudging work trying to get that back up for something as small as this. also, a post below states that more courier agents would serve the purpose of catching bots who earn effortless isk. botting is an independent in this issue i would say, because if there is a courier agent anywhere that generally gives good awards, the botter will most likely go to them anyways. there are bots that run encounter missions as well, with irjunen being a big example of that. there are a minority of people who do run courier missions on the side (i.e miners, industrialists) but they would already be running for say distribution, marketing or financial agents. this change gives people who run missions on the side for the most part more agents than they most likely need, while a smaller pool is available for those who run encounters. while my personnel agents do hand out some couriers, for the most part i'll be getting well-paying encounter missions. changing these two divisions at least to encounter agents will spread more people out instead of having every one run missions for caldari navy or federal intel office.(side note/snarky comment: iirc fed navy at least has personnel agents. why would the main navy corp of an empire give out missions like rancorous researcher or lost that bet? )tl;dr: come may 19th, 10 former divisions will become distribution, and 7 of them will become encounter. for the most part, people do encounter missions for isk. both of the divisions listed above have over 50% encounter possibility as it is. making them encounter division will diversify the new mission system even further."
5/16/2011,"support. the current scheme means many corps that used to have combat agents will now have none, plus majority of agents in eve will be courier, despite the fact that they're mostly ran by just bots."
5/16/2011,"might make identifying bots easier, if ccp hadn't also cleared out the ability to see npc standings on other players in the same patch."
5/16/2011,"there won't be much to see anyway. corps with combat agents will usually also have courier agents, bots can run those too. there will be so many more courier agents everywhere."
5/16/2011,"hello!you all might know that it is pretty healthy to delete the eve cache from time to time.problem is, whenever you do that all your saved passwords, api keys in the ingame browser get deleted, too (for example blink, jb planner etc).i think it would be very nice if the ingame browser isn't affected by the game browser cache.cheers!fiftyouts"
5/16/2011,"and do you really need to activate a jump gate or even more silly a wormhole. wouldnt it be more fun if you actually had to fly into the natural or jump gate generated wormhole. i see lots of new and wonderful tactics here. i am thinking the jump gate would actually generate wormholes at each end of its structure so that no matter what direction you come from you are going to end up almost right at the wormhole. then all you have to do is a quick burn and the ship is off. the nice thing about this is you dont have to worry about hitting the actual structure of the jump gate and be deflected off into nowhere. what if someone puts objects around this new wormhole entry, well that would be a new tactic for gate campers would it not. lets talk about warping through planets and stuff like that. all i can say is arent warp computers supposed to check if there are any large mass objects in the way before actually warping? what about having curved warp paths around any large mass objects like planets, stars, and moons? what if you come out of a station and your jump destination is directly on the other side. well, your jump computer wont allow you to jump until the point is clear of the station. all of this is how things work in the real world and would add so much to the fun and emersion factor of eve, i can hardly believe this stuff hasnt been fixed yet. you wouldnt have to pretend anymore that you didnt just fly completely into a station on warp exit or travel through the center of a gas giant. oh yea and planets and stars and moons would be solid also. until we get the famous planetary flight option, which would be very cool, i think that if one approaches one of these objects too closely in an orbit (yes i said orbit) you will get a warning from your lovely computer voice advising that you are about to burn and die. or in the case of a moon with no atmosphere get sucked down into its gravity well never to return, or at least until we get moon landings from ccp.what about mining? yea, i get bored sometimes. how would it really be if you were out there hunting around for the good ore? first of all arent asteroid fields usually pretty huge, like small moons or planets that either didnt form or got blowed up. so what about procedurally generating fields that stretch for thousands of kilometers, and the deeper you go into them the more abundant the valuable rocks become. and remember that collision system we already discussed; now you have the challenge of piloting your mining barge deep into these fields to find the better rocks, without hitting something solid. and you cant just warp out because objects are in the way so you have to be clear of the field to be able to warp to safety. of course everyone else has to travel into the field with the same risks to come and get you, sorry, capital ships may not fit. oh and npc pirates may have to come in and get you also if they dare, and they are probably just stupid enough to do it. so now i am down deep mining my heart out on some kernite, wait how the hell do i get my ore back to the station without having to haul my hinny back through this field. welcome your new drone buddy the hauling drone. this sweet baby can haul all yer precious rock back to a secure or non-secure container that you dropped off at the edge of the field before entering it. you just fill it up and then either a buddy hauls it to the station or when it is full you now make the trip back out and go get your hauler. so what about that container: if i was a pirate looking to steal something, your container would be a sweet target for me. and shouldnt npc pirates be interested in sealing what they can carry also? so how do we lone miners protect ourselves from this? well, we now have 2 new abilities that allow us to anchor combat turrets near these containers and to program our little scout drones to stay and play watch dog. (cont. on next post)"
5/16/2011,"i think that instead of having to arse end the ship around every time you want to slow down, we have the technology to make temporal thrust reversers that actually create a temporal bubble behind the ship that takes the thrust from your powerful engines and reverses it (this would be a really cool graphic effect also). so you want to get from where you are now, to your buddy who is 200km away. ok, select your bff, and a little menu pops up, well pretty much what happens when you select something in space now except you can enter a velocity that you want to be at when you reach your bud. so i want to be stopped when i get to 2500m from him or her, you dont want to run into them cuz that would not be cool. set 0 in an entry window and the computer will calculate a switch point where you need to go from blow to suck lol that was funny, at least i thought so. set 100m/s and you will blow a little longer than you suck, ok sorry my apologies. just try not to run into your bud as i will explain later. now i have to admit this reference system isnt perfect in this mode because for it to really work well, you can accelerate however you want to a certain velocity but when the computer tells you to pull back on the reigns, you had better do it now and you had better do it at full reverse. if you dont you will not be at the speed you entered into the window at the beginning of all this. one last thing, coming to a full stop can sometimes be hard especially now that the ccp gurus have removed all atmospheric friction from space. again no problem, hitting the all stop button will give control to the computer so it can stop you completely from any speed or maneuver.acceleration mode 4 is the famous autopilot mode from airplane where the blowup guy pops up to help you out. pretty much all you do is select an object, 0m/s will automatically be entered into the window because the autopilot thinks you want to be stopped when you get to 2500m from said object, and hit the engage button. the autopilot does all the rest and gets you to where you need to go, so now you can sit back a drink totties. i dont know if it would be necessary to be able to set a thrust setting for the autopilot for those that dont want to accelerate at full in something like a dramiel. so what do you guys think of the flight modes? i am thinking pretty cool.lets talk about collisions, because i just hate it when i fly through someone. i am thinking 2 types of collisions: one would be between 2 objects that both have shields and one would be between you and an object that doesnt have shields like big rocks and debris. shield vs. shield collisions would basically deflect based on the mass of each object. so the smaller object would be deflected a lot more than the large object to the point if a frigate ran into a titan, the titan wouldnt even feel it but the frigate would be deflected fully. i sense some new tactics here. shield vs. solid object collisions would suck a lot more for the ship with shields, because the rock dont care if it gets hit and it is usually a lot more solid. i am thinking there would be damage to the shields on your ship based on how fast you hit the rock and at what angle i.e. did you head on or did you just graze it. so, for example, i think a reasonable speed to head on a rock is 500m/s. when you do this all your shields are gone. but you still have armor and hull, which arent as good with collisions, so now when you hit an object you are dead unless you are going at say less than 100m/s. ok you head on the rock at 600m/s, sorry you are dead. do you see some really exciting possibilities here whipping through those huge asteroid fields in a pvp fight where one wrong turn could be the end, or the end of your shields? now dont you hate it when you warp through a planet or after coming out of warp you just smack right into a jump gate. (cont. on next post, sorry post is so long)"
5/16/2011,"can you see how this opens up so many options for you to fine tune how you want to pilot a particular battle. just give us options and control right! if you use your keyboard or a joystick to control your thrust, going full throttle is just telling your computer that, hey i want full speed as entered previously, say 200m/s for a battleship or 700m/s for a frigate. pulling the thrust lever all the way back tells the computer that you want to stop. what if you are using a joy stick that is spring loaded to center, well no problem, just put the stick where you want the speed to be and you program one of the joystick buttons to lock that speed into the computer, and voil<U+FFFD> the computer adjusts the speed to match what the stick was at when you pressed the button. combat mode 2 is for the small ships and the control freaks like me who want to really be in charge of where the ship goes. this mode would also go hand in hand with the locked bridge camera mode. speed control for this mode operates exactly the same as in combat mode 1 where you preset the max speed. you now actually pilot the ship on all axis points. that joystick you were using also controls roll with a left or right movement. oh and you can also do things with that mac daddy joystick like program other buttons to fire groups of weapons or activate armor repairers, again the choice is yours. the mouse would have 2 modes that you toggle back and forth from, the first being the normal curser mode and the second pulls up a little direction targeter that the ship will follow in pitch and yaw. what if i want to maneuver the ship in pitch and yaw with my mac daddy joystick, again no problem, you go to settings and tell the game you want to pilot with the joystick instead of the mouse. now your mouse only acts in pointer mode like we are all used to and you would use 4 keys on your keyboard to control thrust/speed and roll. acceleration mode 3 is the first of the, you guessed it, acceleration modes. this mode is how a ship should really act in the vacuum of space. the control computer still helps you though so that you dont go tumbling around like you are in a dryer. however, if you really want to, you can turn off the maneuvering control computer and just pitch, roll, or yaw the ship on any axis while still moving in a straight line through space. so yes you can, well, fly backwards or sideways. with the control computer active, maneuvering acts the same way as it does in combat mode 2, just watch the velocity because your maneuvering radiuses will get real large as you zip around at high speed. thrust control in this mode is a lot different than the combat modes. there is no max speed to set into the computer, and yes you got it, there is no max velocity on the ship because there is no atmospheric friction in space. instead what you have is max acceleration and conversely deceleration, based again on the mass of your ship and the available thrust it can put out, along with how much thrust you set via your trusty joystick or keyboard. so lets say a battle ship can accelerate at 20m/s/s, it would take 10 seconds at full thrust to reach 200m/s. and if you want to go 1000m/s you would burn for 50 seconds. and if you want to go 10,000m/s you would burn for 500 seconds. now here is the catch, i am thinking that there would really be a max velocity, more on you than the ship, at say .5c or one half the speed of light where the laws of relativity would destroy your soul without the protection of a warp bubble. can you imagine the possibilities in eve to really go where no human has gone before, or at least be able to get to the star lit side of a planet that you never get to see because there is no bookmark at that location? one more thing, what about deceleration, there are no thrusters on the front of the ship.

5/16/2011,do try and think about what you say before you look like a total fool.after all using your own words... one would think your definition of this game is just as biased as you blaming malcanis for the same thing.and ditch the red text... totally fail when it comes to seriousness.tldr version - says the pot calling the kettle black.personally i don't have too many issues with the changes if it breaks the status quo in 0.0.

5/16/2011,"this dude really hates the color blind.also, not supported. i like my worthless 0.0, all the greedy types left. i think that they should make ships randomly explode, reactor failures happenpersonally i'd like to see eve rolled back to the apocrypha client, but that's because it was less laggy."
5/16/2011,"the tyrannis deepsafe nerf.when the tyrannis expansion went live, the poseidon method of making deefsafespots was disabled. sometime during the expansion, all objects, including bookmarks, were moved inwards to the deepsafe limit; this limit is a sphere centered on the local star with a radius of ""the celestial object most distant from the local star plus 20 astronomical units"". so, for example, if the celestial object furthest away from the local star is a regional stargate 67 au from the star, then the deepsafe limit is a sphere 87 au in radius.if this proposal were to be implemented, it would be a simple matter to limit the probe-beacon to the deepsafe limit. additionally, it would put everyone on equal footing with players who were collecting old deepsafespots from pre-tyrannis, and who still have those deepsafespots today. granted, those deepsafespots would have been moved to the edge of the limit, but old players could very well have collections of bookmarks surrounding a solar system sitting on that sphere (because their bookmarks were moved in to that sphere during tyrannis). for large solar systems, that's still a lot of volume to hide in; not impossible to be found by probes, just a little bit difficult. combat probes are really only going to have problems in solar systems that have celestial objects 300 or 400 au from each other.supported."
5/16/2011,"when you need a fleet warpin, this would replace the need to have a friendly ship at the destination, with the need to have had a friendly ship at that location some time in the last 2 hours...i can see lots of uses for this to get around the current crushing unworkability of bookmark propagation. then again, might be better to just fix bookmarks."
5/16/2011,"make them findable and destructible by enemies and i'll support. ( but not warpable by enemies )a ship that is used as a warp target has all these characteristics. that should be preserved. i'm concerned though about the case where if a bubble is dropped on the routes from a gate to every other celestial in the system. currently that will snag anyone that doesn't have a saved safe spot bookmark. which is good, say the system is my alliances home. (sure normally the gate would be bubbled too)with arbitrary probes then i can make safes without actually going there. which is bad. that eliminates any ""home turf"" advantage to people who do know the system, and chasing people around in the system can be extrodinarily difficult, making hiding in any system too easy. one tweak would be to make probes get stopped by bubbles. but that would have consequences to scanners. but perhaps that isn't a bad thing. ?"
5/16/2011,"welcome to online gaming, customer care starts off great with loads of ""we'll never be those people"".then after dealing with 100,000 petitions a week people start to grow a hunch back and rsi from copy and pasting.i do not evny the gms, i would prefer a simple ""sorry i cant help you here let me forwards it to someone who can"" rather than copy pasta.but in some areas they can do everything perfectly and you will need to be patient.if you get a reply which equates to ""logs show nothing"" and you know it's ccp's fault then ask to be forwarded to a senior gm.however if you lagged out because of your internet had a poop or didn't have enough tank etc etc, you will likely get nothing back.i can also recommend that you post a thread in missions & complexes with ""has x ever happened to you""i'd suggest you do this every time you loose a ship in a mission to weird space voodoo magic see if anyone else has been effected and see how the gms responded to them.frankly posting in assembly will get you no where."

5/17/2011,"feedback from a < 1-year player:the ""agent"" system was confusing. between tutorial agents, career agents, mission agents, storyline agents, etc. (all representing they are in a ""corp"") it was very confusing to get started with this game. faction agents telling you that ""sorry, i don't work with people i don't know"" after you just ran ""an important storyline"" mission for them made no sense.the ""corp"" system was also confusing. i spent time trying to figure out how to join the military school because i wanted to train my military skills. but you can't, because the military school was just another npc corp. i tried finding an agent for my npc corp to run ""real"" missions for. of course, that's not necessary, and ultimately pointless. players are expected to instinctively know the difference between their starting npc corp, a ""player"" corp, and an npc corp that you run missions for. very confusing at first. typical help channel discussion:new player(np): hey, i finished the profession tutorial missions, what should i do now?help: join a corp.np: i'm in a corp.help: which corp are you in? oh, that's an npc corp.np: okay, but i'm not sure i want to join another corp.help: then go run missions for a corp.np: which corp? my npc corp?help: no, a ""real"" corp.np: like a player corp?help: no! like republic fleet.np: how do i join republic fleet?help: you don't need to join it, just run missions for it.np: i tried, they said i wasn't experienced enough. thought that meant i needed to join it...help: you need a lower quality agent. like this one (link)np: that's 42 jumps away!help: look up one closer. (link)np: there are like 200000 corps... how do i pick the right one?etc.you need to implement a better transition from running the tutorial missions into running ""real"" missions. give new players suggestions as to where to go next after the profession tutorials are done. i went from doing all of the profession missions to the soe arc, where (after 40 or so ""doable"" missions) i got blown up repeatedly attempting to finish the storyline. if someone had pointed me toward a low quality caldari navy agent in a nearby system, i could have saved many hours of frustration. why not implement a simple ""focus"" option at the end of the profession mission lines, asking them if they'd like to do more profession missions, or, move on to a ""real"" agent, and give them a quick rundown of nearby agents in their profession of choice?at a very early point, i was eve-mailed by a ccp rep asking if i had any questions or needed any help. i said no, thanks. why did i do that when i was struggling? because i didn't even know the right questions to ask. maybe if that mail had been a bit more...engaging. for example, ask what i was working on, if i was having trouble accomplishing a goal, etc? not sure.i wish i had written this post months ago, because now the frustrations i experienced in month one are fading. being pointed to the eve survival guide helped a lot, but i was weeks in before another player sent me there. a collection of outlines might help, with typical career choices made by successful players in the past in their first few weeks.once i got back onto track, running missions for an l1 combat agent for a randomly picked corp. (roden shipyards) i started to get frustrated by some of the missions. mining for dolls? really? look, i have a sense of humor, but, a new player trying to grok this game doesn't need something ******ed like that thrown in. and how many ""doll mining"" missions did my combat agent give me? same mission at least 4-5 times in the first week. oh, and it's a 4-part mission... lovely. why not decline 'em? because it gave me a very ominous warning about not doing so that i didn't entirely understand. so, hours chipping at rock for yet another doll. woot."

5/17/2011,"the issue is indeed that ccp keeps claiming that changing name removes consequences (this contrary to the use of disposable alts (see: jita local), buying/selling chars and the impossiblity to see who is whos alt, yes i know that last one wouldnt be trivial, also i want api access to who is online). name change should just be implemented for those with horrible names (like me), with a few constraints:limitted uses, no list of 800 aliases (although cost would also deter that).always being able to see what is the new name when you got the old name.always being able to see what was the old name when you got the new name. then it is much less a removal of consequences than all the other mechanics already present."

5/17/2011,flying the flag for great justice
5/17/2011,"i am not supporting this, however once a ship is tackled (in a bubble) it should not be able to get away. there have been too many times i have seen the ""logoffski"" trick used to save supercarriers and titans that it is just ridiculous. if a ship is engaged and tackled it should be there until the end of the fight."
5/17/2011,"i think a longer timer is warranted in the case of tackled supercapitals. other than that, things are fine."
5/17/2011,the 60 second log off and 15 minute aggression timers both need a rework.they need to be relative to: a) size and class of ship b) nature of aggression
5/17/2011,"i've only ""lost"" one kill in 3.5 years of playing due to a logoffski, it was a freighter jumping blindly through low sec and when he saw my little 2 man camp, he logged. since he wasn't aggro'd when he logged he would have vanished after 1 minute, but what's worse is we couldn't even lock him while his ship slowly emergency warped away. that said i think the basic mechanics are fine. the only ship class i think that might need a change to that are titans and sc's, principally because they take more than 15 minutes for a subcap fleet to actually kill. i would support having super caps never disappear from space no matter how long the pilot is logged."
5/17/2011,"or to play devil's advocate, we could change the game so that ships stay in space regardless of whether the pilot is logged in or not.the catch there is deciding whether a ship in space is abandoned and needs to be cleaned up by the janitor after 30 days or so."
5/17/2011,"i agree, they shouldn't disappear if they are tackled, but other than that everything is fine."
5/17/2011,"i give you the benefit of the doubt and suppose you haven't thought what you are asking, so i will explain the game effect.1) lowsec/0.0: end of my playing time, i log off at a safespot unagressed by anyone2) after 1 minute something wander in and use d-scan to locate my general position. 3) after another 2-3 minute he has pinpointed my ship with probes4) he warp to my unoccupied ship and still has 10 minutes to kill my ship, without the harderners workingi hope this is not what you want. i think this is what the op want and this i can support."
5/17/2011,"1st your dumb because those mechanics are there to protect every one, including your dumb ass.2nd if your fun is about kill pods then you're just too lazy/not prepared, masochist -kill some pod in war ok, just for fun...3rd tasty tears, moar pliz"
5/17/2011,"stealth bombers, covert ops, force recons, black ops should all be able to warp while cloaked, after all they all are paper thin =)"
5/17/2011,b'ops arn't paper thin.....you clearly have no idea what your talking about. please stop posting.......bar the sin b'ops are fine as they are. they simply need bigger jump range + fuel bay (and not by much either or they would become op)personally i would say 20% extra jump range and 300% more fuel bay.
5/17/2011,"nothis is not sto...your not going to see q...it takes time to travel, that is the fact...face it you can have everything...go figure,,,"
5/17/2011,"travel times are a bit long. and traveling is boring, and discouraging. they could be reduced a bit. supported."
5/17/2011,"i'd be in favour of a set of changes that make warp speed more meaningful, with greater variation between ship classes. bigger ships should be slower than at present, and smaller ones noticeably faster."
5/17/2011,"damn i like this ideal at lest it keeps it going, now let me guess which npc corp will have it in its lp store...now if we can get ccp to let us consume the other quafe drinks..."
5/17/2011,"i support the idea of creating some way to purchase quafe zero, not necessarily the original suggestion."
5/17/2011,"no.quafe zero was a gift. if ccp puts that item in the lp store, then that will defeat the whole purpose of making quafe zero a limited-edition item. and if you want to make this product available in the lp store, why not add the limited-edition snowball turrets as well? what about the primae or the echelon? what about the zyphers that can't be attacked by sleepers?also, let's not forget that people are collecting these rare items as a novelty item. sort of like a collector's edition. if you add these items to the lp store or make them sold by npc agents, then the items lose their novelty value."
5/17/2011,that would be kool
5/17/2011,"good idea. docking / undocking could stand to be a bit more glamorous, as long as it doesn't add to docking / undocking times.now, we do have these timers which prevent ship changes / redocking, maybe ccp could work out the mechanics to fit within these time frames."
5/17/2011,"what about the idea of a blank skill. that can be trained while you are away on vacation or in my case..moving across the country and will be without the internet for some time. once you are able to come back online, you would be able to allocate those points where you want them."
5/17/2011,sounds like a wonderful way to train up a skill you aren't remapped to.

5/17/2011,"1. it's one thing to take up industry, it's another to troll about other professions u have no experience or knowledge about, especially when u have such a ****ty killboard, despite a fleet to hide behind.2. oh don't take my word for it; check the killboard u're crying so much about.3. right 'cause ppl would disengage from a guaranteed lol killmail on a smacktard like u. great thinking there. and u have a funny way of showing indifference with all those caps.4. refer to #1.1. it means that they can be one and the same. u're just unable to comprehend that.2. when u cry so much even about the costs of suicide ganking, of course -10s r gonna cry about losing their own exhumers.3. lol and that's why u fail at pvp and industry.news flash: seeing as how u're too stupid to figure it out by now, money is no object to me but apparently, even pennies r too much to u because u still fail at industry. it's your own fault u're poor, not mine. and -10s, as risk-averse and ultra-paranoid as they r, aren't gonna leave their exhumers untanked unless they're as stupid as u. and even then, it's their loss either way.based on the length of your trolling, u're possibly one of my suicide gank victims because once again, u're probably too poor to afford a replacement exhumer since that would apparently be too much money for u. and the best part? u cry about embarassment when u're in no position to judge anyone at all. because a loser like u is so scared of failing that he doesn't even try, even with a fleet to hide behind, as shown by your sorry excuse of a killboard. and a hater like u would naturally talk smack about someone else when u've got nothing to show for yourself so unless u have something to show, plz bump the thread and hate some more--i'd really love to hear it. last time i checked, money laundering, aiding and abetting criminals and other illegal dealings r still illegal so your point is invalid and irrelevant."
5/17/2011,"not according to concord, which is why i'm an unhappy panda."
5/17/2011,"skimmed through and missed it but since u asked nice and u asked twice, sure.*ahem* low sec is a deserted wasteland; it is common knowledge and so many ppl have stated it as well, in addition to proposals to revitalize low sec. it has pretty much all of the disadvantages of 0.0 and none of its advantages. the prey have left low sec for high sec or 0.0 because having to dock/safespot means u're not making isk and even if they do hire an escort, the profit split will not be worth the trouble compared to high sec or 0.0. the only ppl remaining r the pirates and they eventually desert low sec to make isk under a high sec alt because they know what happens when they become the prey. furthermore, the pirates also complain they end up fighting each other out of boredom, as if they do not want to face the risk of doing so. and when killmail-whoring and risk-aversion goes unchecked and it gets too one-sided, this is what happens; self-defeating habits of farming low sec to extinction and hours, sometimes days, of waiting for nothing for both sides.there's been tons of proposals relating to boosting low sec rewards and nerfing high sec but the truth is no amount of added low sec rewards or nerfing high sec will entice a carebear to come because even if that happens, it will just attract more pirates to chase them out again. the only ppl who propose this r the pirates themselves because they only want more targets. therefore, the only true low sec fix is to cut down on how easily the pirates can sustain themselves, especially with a high sec alt.to plug in the loopholes besides player donations:1. all sec status drops in this way will come with a warning so newbies won't be tricked into it.2. all of these sec status drops will penalize both parties by reducing sec status all the way down to the exact amount of whoever's lower, including direct trades.3. ejecting/jettisoning will also have the same sec status drop as a trade since that is aiding and abetting as well. this does not apply in high sec. if a -5 or lower attempts to steal from a jetcan, npc customs will confiscate everything stolen. pirate still keeps his ship. however, in high sec if it was ejected from someone who's not -5 or below, then the ship gets destroyed with no loot.4. accepting a contract from an outlaw will have the same penalty.5. if an outlaw attempts to accept a contract, a mail will be notified to whoever made the contract, asking if he is willing to accept the consequences of aiding an outlaw. if so, same sec status penalty applies to the contract maker.6. all market orders can be arranged with the option of sec status factored in. and all outlaw orders will be highlighted in red. buying or selling to an outlaw will incur the penalty.7. if even 1 corp share is owned by an outlaw, the corp's ceo will be penalized the same way the instant he starts paying dividends.8. once again, all of these sec status drops come with a warning.9. all of the above is void if both parties r above -5.is this gonna outright ban pirating? hardly. pirates will still be able to gank to their fullest extent. they just now have to face the consequences of low sec status, keep up above -5, pvp in 0.0, or continuously open new accounts to launder money (more revenue for ccp) because biomassing low sec status alts is a bannable exploit. risk vs reward. the consequences of ""downtime"" will give piracy actual meaning, give sec status actual meaning, give the prey breathing room to help repopulate low sec and make pirates think twice before averting risk by farming newbies all day and avoiding each other; pirates vs pirates have no penalties after all. rather than a deserted low sec farmed to extinction where the predators r too scared to prey on each other and would rather sustain themselves in the safer space that their prey stays in, low sec would now truly be a steppingstone between the safety of high sec and the free-for-all of 0.0."

5/17/2011,"**** that, just remove cloaks altogether and replace them with something else.cloaks were stupid from the beginning, this isn't star trek."
5/17/2011,no.
5/17/2011,"poit its give cloucker a time to get target or get out i tink inaf for 2-3 hours or so. i not tinking that afk siting is soem interaction, that just anouing evryone.cloucks are okey until they to have limitations."
5/17/2011,"agreed, require fuel or require cloaks use cap, when cloaks are in use allows no cap regen. this will make it require cloaky afkers to decide whether to engage or not in a few hours. the longer they wait the more chances of them not being able to have cap to kill the enemy ship."
5/17/2011,lol at the tears in this thread. quit whining and grow a pair.
5/17/2011,"i'd go further, - cloaks use fuel skewed by mass and role (cloaked titans? are you insane? they are the size of manhattan)- the fuel is contraband in empire due to faction police disapproval of rampant criminal abuse (i.e. no hiding haulers from empire wars - and only traded in low sec)- cloaks give aggro (you want to safespot in your ratting raven, you need a pos)- cloaks set cap recharge and shield regen to zero (cloak up to regen your logistics rorqal? no chance!)"
5/17/2011,1
5/17/2011,problem is this wouldn't stop scammers as many that i've seen use the 14 day free trial for this scam as api checks may link you to the account also you only need the skill at level 1 to work.i still think the best way to work is that if the order cannot be fulfilled then it should be hidden from the market.or to remove all the extra hassle just remove the skill not advised or wanted but the best solution is normally the simplest.
5/17/2011,"considering it is impossible to know if the buy orders are real or a scam, i am for this skill to be looked into, not the complete removal, but how it works in relation to the person putting up the buy order and their wallet balance."
5/17/2011,"we need a bank or bank system,what i would like to see is a bank that you can put your isk in and you get something out of it. or you can get a cd (or something like it) and you can draw isk from it (like in real life). now on the other side you can fin. (forgot how to spell it) a ship the longer you play the better you would have chance of getting isk. like large corp or alliance can bank and have good chance of making isk... remember butterfly effect or you may call sandbox..."
5/17/2011,no we don't.
5/17/2011,this is a simple proposal to make faction guns worth using over their t2 counterparts. the way i propose to accomplish this is just to make the specialization skill apply to any weapon meta5 and over instead of just the t2 version. additionally they should be able to use t2 ammo.
5/17/2011,"supported, i meant to bring that up in the dev question thingy but flat out forgot as i typed the post . along with that, i'd like to see 5x run bpc's for all navy turrets/launchers added to their respective navy lp stores. in any case, as it stands, faction turrets cost 50x what t2 costs and are inferior in both damage and effective range. it's a shame really."
5/17/2011,"yes i agree, we pay top price they should have something special about them. plus i think if you match the item to the ship it should give you something..."
5/17/2011,support
5/17/2011,"i support my own proposal. having faction guns would allow players to pimp their pimp pvp/pve ships a bit more and additionally will great more options to spend lp/tags/isk on. additionally it would make sense to make pirate faction guns a bit better than navy faction guns. pirate>navy>t2. having the spec skill will make faction guns a bit better, and t2 guns will still have the advantage of t2 ammo and price. as it is now, the t2 ammo/price/spec skill make them worthless."
5/17/2011,i have always felt the same way.
5/17/2011,would this allow t2 ammo to be used in faction guns?
5/17/2011,no. the op only says that the spec skill would now apply to meta5+ guns.
5/17/2011,then i won't support this. compare barrage m with faction nuclear and tell me why you would ever use the faction over the t2.
5/17/2011,i might agree to that boost for officer guns but thats it.faction guns are only worth it for certain fittings or newbs lacking the skills for t2 and thats how it should be tbh.price tag of faction guns is of no relevance to their performance only to what ppl are willing to pay for.
5/17/2011,always wanted this.
5/17/2011,ok ouch!!! here is the paragraph. take the air out of space. let us control the movement of our ships. make objects in space solid. and finally add more to mining and asteroid fields. done!
5/17/2011,no!
5/17/2011,"and you needed 5 threads for that? why?also, if you want to discuss your idea, this is the wrong place.. go to feature&ideas discussion forums. and post all in one thread..some titles, tl;dr and punctuation.. and not such a big wall of text would help you.. no scratch that.. would help us a lot in understanding you."
5/17/2011,"agreed, please, develop the code for this physics engine, when it's done, say by mid 2014, submit it to ccp.the core concept is very good, you need make this happen. hint start from open source student project.you may collaborate with these guys eve fan"
5/17/2011,"here is the deal, this site is about fixes and proposals not about sarcasm and writing lessons. i have obviously offended with my proposals. it always amazes me what people will write hiding behind their keyboards in these online games and forums. i am only trying to be constructive. by the way source code for space games should only be written with real physics engines, and the fact that you all buy off on the utter lack of it time and again never ceases to amaze me. flavien brebion is writing the source code for a real physics engine game so i don't need to smarty. of coarse you are probably right it won't be done til 2014. was hoping i could inspire a change here in the mean time, but i guess you can't teach old dogs new tricks."
5/17/2011,"using real physics would involve the removal of ftl, which would break the game."
5/17/2011,"require cloaks to use cap which drains over a few hours, with no regeneration while cloak.the issue i see is this, it requires 0 power to stay cloaked. it is a active module that requires no cap to keep itself running. nearly everything in game requires cap to keep itself up that is active. why not have a ship that slowly drains the cap over a few hours with no cap regeneration while cloaked. this will force cloaked ships to decide whether a. fit a cap booster on their ship, and reduce cargo space for ammo for batteries. or b. stop cloaking for days at a time and only spend the limited time they have efficiently. either way it is bs that i can sit in a rival system for days checking only a few times a day to see if i can get a easy kill in my pilgrim/stealth bomber. many times people have solely reduced a military 5 system down due to the fact they can just sit there afk."
5/17/2011,"fixed.just ignore the afk cloaker. at most, just rat in something you don't care about losing."
5/17/2011,why...it's not broking so don't fix it
5/17/2011,"i'd much rather see the existing frigate classes made relevant before they at more **** to the pile.eaf are useless and need lots of love.interceptors are obsolete thanks to the dramiel.assault frigates still need a buff.i guess bombers are the only ones that seem to be okay.also the promised iteration on t3 cruiser subs and balancing the existing t3 content should come first. sure the tengu is okay, but what about the proteus, loki and the poor legion? the non missile tengu variants are worse than an eagle, or at best on par and it only cost 8x as much.they have maybe 1 fit each that isn't crap, and i'm not sure if the legion even has one."
5/17/2011,bump
5/17/2011,"as the name implies, it would be nice if you could store your ship, and your pod in the capital, jump with the capital and die with the capital, please post constructive replies only!"
5/17/2011,"this has been suggested hundreds of times, and doesn't work. eve's code can't handle more than one player per ship, if i remember rightly."
5/17/2011,"i know this is ccps stock answer to this proposal, but surly there is a way to do it. why couldn't they just write it in a different way ie instead of docking in the carrier you ""attach"" your ship to it and when the carrier jumps you get dragged through with it. you can also put restrictions on it like carrier may only be attached to as many ships as it would normally be able to fit in the ship maintenance bay.this would also solve the standard issue of ""what happens if your docked in the carrier and the pilot logs of?"" as it would just mean you de-attached from the carrier.i've always wanted something like proper docking with carriers but am well aware off ccps coding problems >.<"
5/17/2011,"i think they do has well since they're the first concerned but sometimes, even in the best cases where code is ultra ubber super nice fun etc, a little action means hundreds or thousands of code line. is that a real issue important for the game developing or players experience? -looks more like epeen stuff."
5/17/2011,"not really. i think that has more to do with older players helping out newer players (and not in the ""i've got candy in my van"" way). i think there are some downsides to putting this in game though. 1. the most obvious being force projection. granted, this would provide more force projection to newer corps/players/alliances, but can you imagine the implications in null sec?2. players are undoubtedly to grief newer players with this. adding a constant stream of petitions is generally not a good idea.3. my god, i can only imagine the possibilities to cause trouble and manipulate the game in high lag situations with this."
5/17/2011,"here's a simpler way for them to do this, you must put your ship in the ship maintenance bay and then attach your pod in the carrier, it would not be like docking, more like viewing another ship, also when you log in without the carrier pilot being logged on, you would auto detach and auto appear from where the carrier safes up(notice that the carrier is nowhere to be seen). you would have no influence on the carrier other then to detach your pod from the carrier when it is logged on."
5/17/2011,"yes i agree, their sould be some way..."
5/17/2011,"i have a proposal for the csm that will solve quite a lot of problems facing some folks in empire, whilst at the same time, forcing players to join together. its quite simple.1) new players spend two to four weeks in the traditional npc corp like they always have, but now;2) they get booted from the corp after their 'graduation period' and;3) become neutral in empire, with no affiliation allowing us to - 4) blow the absolute bejeusus out of them.now.. why?a) botting bastards are most often than not, found in npc corps. after a month, fair game.b) point 2 would force legitimate players to find a proper corporation, thus, improving the social aspect of the game, and making it fun for everyone.c) because its a fun thing to do, to teach the 'hard lessons of eve', yeah folks, remember those days? but mostly fun destroying a bunch of botters. or... allow us to wardec npc corps.thank you."
5/17/2011,"yes i see your point... even make it where pc corps gets better missions i left a corp to get in 'the scope' well it suck! the corp channel suck i thought the scope was news but the member didn't ... just put it, it was just another npc corp.just let you know i like to solo but it is fun (and the sandbox thing) when you log on you see if you are at war. if so what are you going to do... that is eve"
5/17/2011,"so you want to have easy kills on players who cant defend themselves under the very poor disguise of shooting botters? whats next, removal of all npc bounties and asteroids to combat botters? (and rogue drone loot of course). if you would want to hurt botters, the first thing you need to ask always is if it hurts botters actually more than legit players, now:does a botter or a newb know better how to corphop? indeed, the botter, so he doesnt have much of an issue.is a botter or a newb faster with logging off/cloaking up when a wt enters local? exactly, the botter, so he doesnt have much of an issue. in other words, try low sec or 0.0 instead of asking ccp for easy targets who dont shoot back."
5/17/2011,"i'm not asking for easy targets, i can get them any day in lowsec / 0.0. what i'm proposing is a fix to a really stupid game mechanic. ccp claims that one of their goals is to bring people together, to work, fight, play together. then why promote solo play by letting people stay in noob corps? they don't like it? tough, thats eve.. at least, it used to be.killing botters is just a nice side effect. doesn't take much to form/join a corp for those who stick in the npc ones."
5/17/2011,"so you want to let people socialise by kicking them out of corporations with thousands of players in them and forcing them into one-men corporations? eve is a sandbox, stop forcing people how they should play in the sandbox."
5/17/2011,"there are better ways to stop botters.there is no need to force players to be social, although i agree it would be better for them, it is up to them to decide how they want to play eve."
5/17/2011,yes i like them and it's like we are making the history and future. what did you do hire someone from wow?
5/17/2011,"you mean find another agent nearby to get different kind of missions, hmm i guess that will be the way to go after next patch if you want some variation. i will remove the division part of the proposal as ccp will never consider changing that back since they would have to mess with skillbooks again.i am trying to remember how the mission terminals worked in swg pre-cu-nge, but it has been so long ... i believe you could choose between several missions and several types. perhaps that could be interesting."
5/17/2011,"i agree, they all seem to be the same... you hear this csm, this is you job to do something.."
5/17/2011,i think we should have it where you don't know what is on the other side...maybe i missed somethink but we should have where we can share or sell the location of the wh to others...
5/17/2011,"instead of a pool of funds i'd like the chance to have a personal wallet, so i can assign funds towards different things, ie planetry stuff, building stuff, research. i think it would be easier to track how much money i spend on any thing."
5/17/2011,"spreadsheets.bestowing the gift of knowing how much iskies are required beforehand, at many convenient internets near you.for serious though, if you'd go to the bother of keeping track of multiple personal wallet divisions to figure your expenses/profits afterwards, just faceroll a spreadsheet to figure your expenses/profits beforehand."
5/17/2011,"or, if you prefer a more progressive response with a little less snark, try supporting this proposal instead:multiple wallets"
5/17/2011,"i first raised this in 2008- and we had csm support at the time. ccp said no from what i recall. the three years since, i'm doubting they have changed their mind."
5/17/2011,in my opinion it would be very handy to access the customs office via a bookmark i made of it. so i have just bookmarks of customs offices i actually use and could right klick in space to access them. currently i just have the navigation options present in the bookmark's menu.
5/17/2011,sure it would be unrealisticat least i wanna see a vector where my ships direction is pointing too
5/17/2011,very good ideaps.: the pos system have to rework anyway ;)
5/17/2011,are you playing the same game that the rest of us here are?you wouldn't happen to be a babylon 5 fan would you? or applying for nasa?
5/17/2011,this is mostly related to logistics ships and rr in general.so what is the problem with it?killmails.null/low sec - repairing on stations or logging off.so the first issue is that you want to get on killmails but you cant well this idea is that everything you rep that gets on a killmail transfers you on to it as well maybe under a subheading of support.second issue when someone repairs on a station or logs of the aggression of the person they have been assisting does not transfer.this means that you can repair someone on a gate/station you can dock/jump with no penalty against you.this also means that you can log off (so long as no one has caused aggression against you) and vanish in 60 seconds.both of these are considered unfair as well it should be risk versus reward.
5/17/2011,"it's not about mining per se.. its about bots that run pi, that run courier missions, that run kill missions, bot's that trade etc pp...what you get is singularity.nothing you do as a player has any meaning over there. just dock and get a new ship for nothing. killed someone? he reships. killed an alliance? they just get a new bunch of scs and come again.earned your first freighter? so? let that macro there run for a week and you can make/buy three of them.earned your first sc? so? let those macros there run for a week and make/get 5 of them."
5/17/2011,under no circumstances shall a game mechanic be introduced through which cva could claim to be the legitimate government of amarr.
5/17/2011,im training to use t2 guns on a abaddon at the moment and you need large energy turret l5 then large pulse spec 1 to use the large pulse t2 and the moment i get large energy turret l5 to unlock the capital energy turrets i then only need capital energy turrets l1 to unlock them.i think for battleship t2 guns or missiles launchers whatever weapons use on battleship to me it seems a bit excessive to have to get large energy turret l5 i think to get it l4 would be more reasonable.t2 heavy and sentry drones may need to be looked at aswell if were to lower the skill requirements for battleship t2 guns and missile launchers.all the battleships i think are like this and i only have amarr left to do on my main so isnt going to matter for me but would help others i think.
5/17/2011,"all of the t2 guns need <size> <weapon> v, why should large be any different?"
5/17/2011,i think the training time for a t2 gun for bs shouldnt be virtually the same as a gun for a dread seems bonkers.
5/17/2011,"move along people, nothing to see here."
5/17/2011,thank you trebor. i look forward to more interesting meeting reports when you discuss stuff that we all can hear.
5/18/2011,"hams are pretty good, but they could use a slight buff to flight time. it would be nice if they could hit out at point range in practice instead of just in theory. missile speed-up + moving around gives you an effective range of 20km or so.overall though, i don't see a problem with the drake. it's popular with large fleets, but so are battleship gangs and hac gangs. in small gang pvp it is an okay choice. for solo pvp it's not so good because of its speed and sluggish agility, even nano-fit. it is easy-mode for missions up to l3, but once you skill up other ships will complete the missions more quickly. yeah, it can do l4s, but only very slowly... you can do some l4s with assault frigates too, should all those be nerfed? drake is good, no doubt about it, but far from being super uber no matter how you look at it."
5/18/2011,"i'm annoyed with the prevalence of neuts as well. if you have any spare high slots you fill it with a neut, no questions asked, with the occasional exception of a tackling frigate which might use a nos.i would like to see energy neuts destroy less energy than is used to activate them. then, buff the neut bonus of the curse, pilgrim, and sentinel to compensate. this makes neuts a little less viable overall. usable, but not in a ""one module to rule them all"" kind of way.a buff to nos would also be nice; perhaps they could always pull in capacitor, but when your target has less capacitor than you do, the amount transferred is proportional to the amount left in the target (they have 10% cap, the nos only transfers 10% of its normal amount). something like that anyway. right now the nos is too defensive of a module and a bit of offensive capability would be great.as far as the af 4th bonus... i really would enjoy an ewar resistance bonus, maybe 5% per level. 25% resistance to webs, ecm, damps, whatever is affecting them. this would greatly reinforce the role of a heavy tackler and give them something truly unique."
5/18/2011,"it would be nice i suppose, but i've always thought of hams as being a scram/barely out of it range weapon which happens to have a bit of extra range as a nice bonus. ships with a velocity bonus like the cerberus can reach out to about 40km with them."
5/18/2011,"heavy missiles need to be looked into.the drake and tengu are simply to versatile with out the trade off's of other weapons systems.they have by default an insane range for a cruiser sized weapons. they hit farther than the other ranged option and do full damage at there full range. getting artillary to hit out 100km is difficult and requires additional mods.they are also just as viable close up and do not suffer from a ranged weapons handicap of not being able to hit close targets.for a weapon that always hits they simply do to much dmg and are far to versatile without penalty.changes to keep the flavor coiuld involve them traveling slower and making that aspect, or an improvment to defender missiles."
5/18/2011,can we get a comment on defender missiles?also believe they should reduce damage incoming to your fleet and not just yourself. i know this is not simple but a comment on the defender system would be nice
5/18/2011,mimnitar tracking links are vastly vastly under used. when was the last time you saw one? do you even know what they are? these really really need to be more effective.
5/18/2011,i like the large friendly letters on the cover.+1
5/18/2011,"meh, why not."
5/18/2011,qft
5/18/2011,posting in a size enhancement thread to confirm that size does matter.
5/18/2011,"can anyone confirm that ccp are updating the ship graphics soon? i suspect i may have seen pictures of the new textures in a thread alongside the proposed ship paintjobs and corp logos. if that were the case, they could scale the ships in the same patch as the new graphics (presumably designed to fit the new size) and not have to worry about blurred texture scaling."
5/18/2011,"not only should they be larger, but their collision boxes should be increased as well.looks impressive when 40+ (or however large a sc roam is these days ) drop out at a single cyno but dammit, they should be bouncing all over the damn place when that many drop in around one point in space (would act a nice balancing feature as well)."
5/18/2011,"afk cloaking goes against the ""terms of service"" 16.you may not do anything that interferes with the ability of other eve online subscribers to enjoy the game or web site in accordance with its rules...afk cloaking has only one purpose, to keep others from enjoying eve"
5/18/2011,"fixed your post. please, cry more. you're only making me want to cloak up somewhere."
5/18/2011,please do. eventually you will **** off enough people with your cowardly tactic of not fighting that ccp/csm will actually address the fact that it should not be allowed as part of the game since you dont actually have to be playing the game to do it
5/18/2011,there was an afk cloaker in my alliance's home system for weeks on end a while back. do you know how i countered him?i ignored him. i did my ratting somewhere else and did everything else i always do in said home system exactly the same way i would if he wasn't there.
5/18/2011,nc sanctum farmer alt spotted!
5/18/2011,"hi, please tell me how somebody being cloaked is interfering with your ability to play eve onlineedit: also i think you might be in danger of losing the ability to post here since you are spaming the same topic over and over again."
5/18/2011,"actually, the thing stopping you isn't the cloaker, it's the knowledge that he's there. the problem is local. local is against the tos."
5/18/2011,"fear:the brain structure which appears to be at the very center of most of the brain events associated with fear is the ""amygdala"" (greek for ""almond"", its shape). the amygdala seems to respond to severe traumas with an un-erasable fear response (""post-traumatic stress disorder"", or ptsd; click for a superb site by the madison institute of medicine on ptsd). it seems to be genetically different and ""wired"" for a higher level of fear in some individuals, such as those with panic disorder. and it recently has been shown to be larger in some people with bipolar disorder, though what that means is still a mystery."
5/18/2011,"wrong, it's to subvert the use of local.being afk and cloaked does not stop the use of:stargates.stations.ships.modules.playing the game."
5/18/2011,"it actually does stop you from playing the game. the only thing you can do while someone is claoked in your system and you know they have a cyno and the ability to kill industrial ships is either leave the system or sit there. cloaking in system is an amazing way to stop everyone who lives in the system from making isk in said system. thats why it is an extremely unbalance mechanic. its extremely effective but takes no risk or effort once you get into the system. if you want to disrupt peoples ability to play the game and make isk, you should have to actually be at your computer."
5/18/2011,"if you truly believe that, petition everyone that you see afk cloaking and see how long it takes for a ban/warning.caution though- the hammer may not fall where you want it to."
5/18/2011,"no, actually, an afk cloaker in 'your' system does not force you to do, or to not do, anything at all. if there are lots of you, how about a standing fleet?also, how about you post with your main?"
5/18/2011,"no, that is you stopping yourself. at least be factual in your replies."
5/18/2011,"@glykeni do@danikahow would a standing fleet make a difference for the person cloaking. if we had a thousand people in the system it wouldn't make it any more likely for the person who is afk to have any risk of losing their ship, and all they would have "
5/18/2011,"i've often enjoyed the travel times in eve. it lends a sense of scale often unseen in alternative mmos. not supported, if you want to warp faster there are rigs that can do that for you."
5/18/2011,"not supported, without better justification of why, besides ""i get bored"".you must demonstrate how to mitigate the adverse affects on aggro timers, bubble tactics (dropping cans to stop cloaked ships may become infeasible given jettison timers), and possible adverse affects of the increased load on the servers. grid mechanics are implicitly throttled by warp travel times. basically, though meaning well, you have thrown up a suggestion that may have many negative or unexpected affects on the game (besides making your travel faster). you are going to need more justification for it."
5/18/2011,"this started as a way to get more low level haulers into the economy but it has become a benefit to the economy and game depth in it's own right. please read and familiarize yourself with the thread below for the background and evolution of this proposal. income stream for haulers the background supporting it,guristas and kidnappingclear skiesi decided to rename the proposal to reflect more closely the ""spirit"" of the change, and also to avoid turning off those on the forum who don't care for industrials. ( but i didn't want to rename the original thread which would mess up search lookups. )"
5/18/2011,we need the commodity: cake
5/18/2011,"ah, but the cake is a lie."
5/18/2011,only if the logs show nothing.
5/18/2011,mmm.... cake!
5/18/2011,do we have towels yet? we need towels and cake.
5/18/2011,"meh, i can pop my alt over and over again, easier than catching pods.but supported on general idea."
5/18/2011,"why make it available in an lp store, when you could make bpcs for qz available instead?it could require quafe ultra, perhaps a touch of booster gas, whatever. i think the qz limited edition should remain a gift, but perhaps the qz bpcs could produce one with 3% bonuses instead of 5%.combat boosters in general could use some looking-into and this would be a nice touch."
5/18/2011,"only if it's optional, as i ,personally, would have it flagged as spam otherwise. of course, i don't get much mail anymore, so it might not be so bad."
5/18/2011,"first of all i want to stress that this proposal intended to limit afk and not cloaky gameplay.the idea is to introduce a pos module that will generate a system wide wave of particles that will stop all cloaking devices momentarily. now any player will be able to recloak after reactivation timer of their cloaking device.afk players will be vulnurable to a combat probe scan.the pos module will require some kind of fuel,it should have reactivation delay of some length 15-60 minutes,it also may require sov level or even i-hub upgrade.something is needed to stop 23hour afk cloakers especially after latest updates in 0.0. as of now there is nothing one can do except always be ready for a hotdrop from a titan or blackops."
5/18/2011,there are a dozen threads about this active right now. did you really have to add another one?
5/18/2011,"yes. i have a guy in arazu with 2 cyno generators (covert and regular), titian and covert hotdrops were made. he sits 23 hours online and we have guys like him almost in every system with ss lower -0.6, sometimes more then one.the problem is they only risk their ships for a few seconds, when they ready to make their move and we are vulnurable 23 hours when we undock."
5/18/2011,"remove local, then you don't see them any more.while ever local remains in it's current form, afk cloaking is a viable counter to subvert it's use."
5/18/2011,"good to know you're trying to keep things as arbitrary as possible, theft is allowed, unless you're a criminal of coursethis actually makes alot of sense, especially for nullsec where customs doesn't exist(and don't exist in lowsec either for that matter).murdering anyone you see in nullsec- no penalty.exchanging iskies with -10s in nullsec- massive sec hit.how bad this idea is- priceless.for everything else there's mastercard.ah, now its okay to steal from criminals but nobody else? oh that's right! criminals aren't allowed to steal, that makes sense... errr... wait... no.in a game based on free-market and sandbox gameplay, let us endevour to make it less so. good plan. let us bring law to lawless space and spread highsec to all the land!im glad you typed that out again, i was worried it'd be gone by the time i read it again.im glad you typed that out again, i was worried it'd be gone by the time i read it again.you're aware that's free, right?except for the part where it doesn't happen. you might as well throw out your propsal and ask people nicely to treat them as guidelines and to pretty please follow them, it'd have to same level of enforcement behind it and would save alot of bother.this would be a whole lot easier if you just added concord... oh wait... we already have that. let us make lowsec better by trying to make it more like highsec with the most roundabout and easily bypassable means ever!coming from a suicide griefer, lol.free-for-all of 0.0 ... do you not remember all the restrictions you just barely proposed(which would have to be extended into null to be even slightly effective even without being easily bypassed)? not a free-for-all when you're done with it.i know it's a shocking idea to even consider addressing a problem directly, but just imagine how lowsec could be made more worthwhilse... -by making it more worthwhile!-, crazy i know, i'd suggest we should attempt to do it in the most indirect and ineffective way possible, but you got that covered.i've not bothered to do even more mini-quotes so i feel i should tell you bold goes to bold, italics to italics, and underlined to underlined... personally i feel this is obvious, but you've shown yourself to be master of missing such."
5/18/2011,"i respect your replies most of the time rented, but i have to step in here. i don't usually engage in personal arguments, and several people on the thread have already made more than a threads fair share of petty personal (and non relevant) jibes, but i feel i need to step in here. anna may have been guilty of the same petty bickering in the past, but she finally put the time in to explain her point logically. rented, your response is uncalled for and seems solely based on personal bias against her. just because we may not like each other personally does not mean that we should not treat rational proposals and posts rationally. i have not read your complete post but at a glance you seem to discount anna's suggestions without suggesting a suitable solution as a replacement. what exactly do you mean by ""make it more lucrative?"" do you mean make more high value ore in low sec? i'm sure we would consider your alternatives if you have any. i'm not sure you know what term term ""free market"" means. it means that the market is free to set it's own prices. it has nothing to do with the sandbox nature of the game. even then the sandbox does have rules, unless you are arguing for anarchy. at least you seem to acknowledge the problem of low sec being gimped. so how can we fix it? i'm not saying that my or anna's suggestion is the only way, but if you want you contribute constructively to the thread, why don't you suggest an alternative?"
5/18/2011,this isn't a very good situation for those who would like to pay ransom to a pirate.
5/18/2011,"touche! well like everything there is a simple solution that adds complexity to the game (just don't sec-status tax those transfers, remember the tax only is applied to 'player donation' transfers, and presumably ransom will be its own category, easily detectable by the system as you would be in the kidnapped state). but there would be situations that it wouldn't cover (friends paying your ransom) so seeing as how i see the other proposal as adding more interesting depth to the game, i backed off this current one a while back, happy to shelve it for further thought. and as others mentioned, this is more low-pri."
5/18/2011,"i agree with eperor, turn it into a strategic action on both sides."
5/18/2011,is that afk guy stopping your bots?
5/18/2011,"hey look at that, same hand full of people saying they dont want it changed because they like it the way it is. let me guess, the reason you spend so much time on the forums is because you have all 6 of your accounts afk cloaking in random systems.glad so many people are standing up and saying they are sick of a few getting a huge advantage over others while they aren't even actively playingedit: spelling"
5/18/2011,"hey look at that, same hand full of people saying they don't want a change, because they can't bot any more and want to keep their all seeing eye. let me guess, you have 6 botting accounts in certain systems.glad so many are against and standing up saying they are sick of the botters getting a hugh isk advantage while they aren't actively playing.edit: i can post daft things too t'raq."
5/18/2011,this alt supports the idea of paying for some extra training time.
5/18/2011,"why not just make the skill not trainable by trial accounts, problem solved? surely that is the easiest solution :)i'm not entirely against your 'hide the order idea' in theory, but in practice i suspect it would put too much load on the server. think about the race conditions that may occur, and database deadlock problem of checking each order on everyone's market screen to see if the other side has enough isk. much simpler to just put a demerit marker on people who ""commit overdraft"" and penalize their margin skill for successive overdrafts, as this is data stored on the character skill db itself and the check is done at the time of posting an order, just once."
5/18/2011,"keep the map layout the same in terms of connected solar systems (connected nodes for jump avenues) but equip every ship with a jump drive. the distance you could travel would depend on the size of the ship. frigates can jump up to 3 systems (small, fast, maneuverable as they are), cruisers/battle cruisers up to 2, bs and larger can jump 1. jumping requires a certain amount of capacitor, efficiency can be increased through skills. jumping also places you at a random point in space in the destination system.additionally, give warp disruption bubbles the ability to pull people out of warp anywhere in their warp line. possibly add skills for dictors/hics that increase the radius of capture.the idea of this proposal is to make travel more dynamic, and also allow for true ambush/interdiction style of game play. this is also intended to make large fleet maneuvers a bit more dynamic and give an opportunity for both attackers and defenders of systems the opportunity to suffer the fog of war."
5/18/2011,"i like the spirit of the idea because stargates are annoying, but no. this would totally break eve.there are bigger ships that can do similar to what you are asking."
5/18/2011,"i know there are bigger ships that can perform this role. what i'm proposing is to make fleet movements and travel in general more dynamic, and allow for more interesting types of fleet/gang engagements rather than point engagements at entry/exit points. also, allow for true ambush tactics and interdiction maneuvers.it also allows for smaller forces to take on larger fleets through use of guerilla tactics.i appreciate the reply, but if you could be more specific than a blanket ""this will break eve"", i could adjust the proposal. i'm fine with the gates as they are now, although they are a little boring, just looking for a way to make space and systems actually feel large and space-y."
5/18/2011,why? part of eve is corps and the other part is isk' and both needs banks
5/18/2011,this already exists in eve.
5/18/2011,"the point of a bank irl is to hold your money safely rather than have you walk around in the streets with a suitcase full of banknotes or stuffed into a pillowcase under your bed. in eve, my wallet is completely secure. nobody can access it without my consent, i can't get mugged in a dark alley and have it all stolen, burglars cannot break into my hangar and take it while i'm out in a fleet. it seems that what you're really asking for is an official ccp bank to make you risk-free interest? no, in a sandbox economy you put your money on the line and make investments in the hope of profit, you don't ask big daddy ccp for easy handouts."
5/18/2011,"not realy true that evem oney its safe. its meny times when accou8nts get hacked and you lost your items and money, afocrs money ccp giving back but not times you losing them complitly."
5/18/2011,"pirate: ""100 mil or your pod is dust"".victim: ""ok. but you'll have to wait until i can get to the next high-sec cash dispenser. you can accompany me if you want to make sure i go there."":p"
5/18/2011,"i'm not supporting this yet as it doesn't seem fully formed as a proposal, but you broght up an interesting point. the problem though is if you have a bank, you will need bankers. unless by 'bank' you just mean 'i want interest on my isk that i'm not using'. if your proposal is the latter, recall that (unless you want uncontrolled inflation in the game -- bad idea) to get interest, someone must pay interest. banks are savings and loans businesses. you can't have savings (with interest) without the loans (charging interest) on the other side. which means you will need people willing to borrow money, but then you will need people to collect when you don't repay loans, and a functioning credit system in order to rate people's credit worthiness for loans, etc etc.as you can see, it's not a simple change. banks are an essential part of an economy, and right now eve runs without one as it is only a virtual economy which is not entirely complete (there are npc corps which have 'infinite cash').so that's the long answer of why your proposal won't likely work, without a lot more thought or a big big change on ccp side."
5/18/2011,"well there i disagree with you maz3r, i assumed in your original post that they would be allowed to use t2 ammo as well. without the ability to use t2 ammo, they would remain inferior in general to t2 weapons even if they did 10% more raw damage with faction ammo. they wouldn't be as inferior, but inferior none the less. my view on the matter is faction should always, without exception, be superior to t2 in all respects. cost effective is another matter, but they should be outright superior in terms of performance.as for those about to say cost isn't a balancing factor, yes and no. it's a balancing factor when it offers a small boost. it's when you get a huge boost that renders you effectively invincible that it falls apart. yes, i'm looking at you mr. dramiel/cynabal/machariel. a case of cost properly balancing out with performance is the bhaalgorn, it's better than any t1 bs but they are rarely used since they aren't 800m isk better."
5/18/2011,"i think it is a good solution to boosting faction weapons (which, imo, would be a good thing).this suggestion still lets you benefit from training specialization skills, but doesn't obsolete t2 guns, which you need to use t2 ammo.so, can the suggestion be boiled down to: ""make all guns meta5 and above require specialization skills""?the damage boost would then follow from the skill's description.i like."
5/18/2011,"i didn't say they shouldn't get t2 ammo. i was just saying all my proposal is is just make the spec skill apply. if there is enough support, i'll add in the t2 ammo to the proposal."
5/18/2011,"without t2 ammo, they're still worse than t2 guns, whatever you do."
5/18/2011,"sorry, i misread then. i guess then i support this conditionally, because i want to keep the t2 ammo to t2 guns.no, it wouldn't make the faction weapons useless, as they would have more dps and smaller fitting requirements (i assume). it forces you to make a trade-off. if you want to use barrage, then use t2 guns. if you can live without it, you can fit faction."
5/18/2011,i don't see any reason why high meta lvl guns shouldn't be able to use higher meta ammo. updated op.
5/18/2011,"actually, once specialization is factored in, faction guns will do more dps with faction ammo (but not with t1 normal ammo) than t2 guns with t2 short range ammo. t2 ammo has drawbacks that faction ammo don't, but is cheaper."
5/18/2011,"but will they have the range to match t2 long range ammo? somehow, i doubt it."
5/18/2011,those have drawback in dps.
5/18/2011,support
5/18/2011,"simple solution. make all faction and officer weapons t2. skills required for t2 weapons will also be required for faction/officer. then they're all worth buying fitting and using.to be honest thought. the whole storyline/faction/deadspace/officer modules need a rebalance. especially the faction stuff. why should one module completely outperform all other modules in all aspects (eg warp disruptors). some warp faction warp disruptors are simply just easier to fit where the top of the line is not only the very easiest to fit but also has the max range. these attributes need to be rejuggled so that one module offers one thing while another offers something else but not everything in the same module. however, i digress."
5/18/2011,"so wow, congrats! you just gave an idea without reason or justification .... would you please explain further."
5/18/2011,maybe to make them worth using?
5/18/2011,"i have always seen faction/deadspace/etc mods as modules that are as good as t2 or better, but without the skill requirements, in many cases easier fitting, and not the additional benefits of using t2 skills.i would not like the t2 damage bonuses to be applied to them; i would rather that they be buffed in such a way that, with max skills, they do more damage than a t2 weapon of the same type while keeping their reduced fittings.this lets you make a choice - you can use the faction weapons for easier fitting, less skill requirements, and more damage overall, or use t2 which requires more skills, more fitting, does a bit less damage, but has the flexibility of t2 ammo.i support the topic in general, except for faction guns using t2 ammo."
5/18/2011,any more support for this idea?seems everyone soo far is up for the idealittle changes
5/18/2011,i am sick of gratuity gifts of tritanium.
5/18/2011,"i support this as long as ccp thinks it's a good idea. i personally don't mind getting newbie ships when i dock, it's not a big deal, but it is one more thing for the server to do:1. check to see if a pod has docked2. check to see if the pilot has ships in station3. if not, create a new ship with modules and a unit of tritanium4. send the pilot mail.we could do away with this automatic process with a station button. not sure how much of an impact this would make on the servers and database, but every little bit counts right?"
5/18/2011,how about a long cycle time for cloaking devices but have it shut off after every cycle. that would allow anyone at the computer to stay cloaked almost constantly but stop afk cloakers because they would have to reactivate the cloaking device in order to stay cloaked.
5/18/2011,no.please explain what detriment afk cloaking imposes on this game.
5/18/2011,"ok,it allows players to directly affect the game play of others without actually having to be playing the game. they can walk away from the computer with no fear of losing their ship, while they disrupt the game play of others. if they want to disrupt others by cloaking in a system fine, but they should have to be at the computer while they do so."
5/18/2011,"technically speaking, market orders and contracts allow you to affect the gameplay of others without being at the computer. so does autopiloting across highsec. would you like to see those removed?"
5/18/2011,it does not directly effect anyone or anything. in order to directly effect someones game you have to be actively doing so.it indirectly effects you because you allow it to mess with your head. so the issue is with you and the boogie man.
5/18/2011,"the difference is that these can be combated by other players, buy/sell orders can be outbid and you can still be shot while autopiloting (though i do think its crap that you get paid full insurance when you shoot someone in highsec) further autopilot does not actually directly affect other players. afk cloaking on the other hand allows a player to directly affect others while being completely safe him/herself. going afk while docked at a station is the only other time you can walk away from your computer and be sure of your safety while in 0.0 space and that ability comes at a substantial cost, while afk cloaking cost only about 1m isk."
5/18/2011,"afking in a freighter while hauling stuff for courier contracts, market ****ery etc etc affects people. afk cloaking doesn't need combating. if someone is afk, by definition they are no threat to you. would you also like to see sanctions placed against people who log off in hostile space? who knows when they'll log back in and cyno in 500000 caps?"
5/18/2011,"if their existence in your system alone disrupts you, perhaps you should seek another game. seriously. i can understand if they are attacking you how that might disrupt you, but they are afk. they are doing nothing."
5/18/2011,"even in a freighter you can be shot, as far as what you are hauling, again that is not directly affecting anyone. perhaps i need to explain what that is for you. to directly affect someone, the effect of the action must directly affect other. effecting the market is not directly connected to hauling something, it is from selling or buying something. what your hauling directly affects the decision of the gankers since they decide whether it is worth shooting you based on what your hauling, but the fact that your afk makes little difference since if you weren't they could still kill you, they would just have to work a little harder at it.if you aren't playing the game, you should not be in the game. and if you are in the game you should always be able to die, especially in 0.0. like i said, i have no problem with someone cloaking in my system all day long and waiting for the perfect time to attack someone. i have a problem with them being able to walk away from the computer without having to worry about losing their ship. there is no other time in eve, even in high sec, that you can be in space and have no fear of losing you ship.thats why i think giving cloaking devices a one cycle limit before they have to be reactivated is a logical solution. if you are at the computer and actively participating in the game it will not change this tactic at all, but it will stop people from walking away from the computer and being completely safe without the use of a macroedit: spelling"
5/18/2011,you knowthe 80s band prefab sprout had a song called the king of wishful thinkingbut i'm going to go ahead and crown you the king of awful poasting
5/18/2011,please explain how your game play is affected if someone is simply cloaked and away from keyboard.its confusing the rest of us.i see you've never heard of a pos then?

5/18/2011,"i believe that changing a ship requirement to fly would make more sense if the requirement is the certificate instead of the skill to fly the ship.i mean you can drive a car but if you're driving without a license you are risking a fine or a criminal offence.so sure you can drive in a car without a license in the real world, but usually is the country side or some other less developed part of the country. i suppose you can make it so you can fly a ship without a certificate in low sec or null if you want.point is i keep reading that players do not follow a certificate cause it is useless and just a guide. developers, i am sure are irritated hearing this, and i am sure they have other more pressing problem to take care. and i am sure there will be more players complaining that it will be more time spent training for a particular ship.however please note that t1 ships are easy to fly already and their certificate are only at basic level, while t2 ships already have lvl v skill or skills as a requirement depending upon the ship class.so what's the benefit to player? well quickly considering i would have to say very little, but it would make a feature of the game from useless to useful, and would give incentive to newer player to move out to low sec, to at least fly the ship with minimal requirement. so if there's any value it would be to developers and to pirates who would see an increase in new player in low sec. finally it is a shame if the purpose of a certificate is only as a bragging rights among the older and more experienced player.this is my first post, and on impulse i post this topic, interested to see what flames, trolls or like-minded supporters i would get from my post, please make it amusing cause it would really make my day."
5/18/2011,"we have our pod pilot licenses already. those who's license has run out can't log on in to the game. every active player you see is flying with a license already. also bringing up a gamedesign change because of rl is the dumbest thing a person can do. this is a game and the design will always be based on the gameplay and rl considerations are entirely secondary.you would be wrong about the devs opinion.as the devblog shows the system was specifically designed just to be a guide to new players who don't know better and it's working exactly as intended. you are correct in thinking players would be angry, since it would be more training for a ship that is totally unncessary for actually flying the ship and you haven't provided any good reasons why the current systems should be changed. a vague rl analogue and not knowing the design intention behind certificates doesn't really cut it.the rest of you post is pretty much rubbish. it is all based on the mistaken concept, that certificates where meant to be something more than just rough guides to new players to ease them into and teach them the skill system.not supported."

5/18/2011,"lol. well said.brok, sorry, but you must have misunderstood this game if you think that it needs real world physics. i'm not trying to be sarcastic here, but where did you get the impression that eve was a space simulator? it's a space opera sandbox game. think starwars, star trek, wing commander. not star control, or babylon 5.even if all that physics can be added to the client without completely bogging down the servers (just think about what lag would do to a simulator engine like that), it would really take away from the game. why, even creating a simple orbit around a target would be a chore.when it boils down to it, we are humans who live in a thick atmosphere, and the physics of aerodynamics is much more intuitive to us. if you really have such a bone to pick with the existing physics engine, then i'm surprised you didn't point out the numerous other glaring holes, like weapon occlusion, sound in a vacuum, or the fact that half of the ship designs are not symmetrical. (how can these maneuver evenly with a center of mass not in the center of the plane of travel?).eve is space opera. not a space sim."
5/18/2011,"cloaks are fine. the reason people sit in systems cloaked up, is more often to prevent botters than anything else. one person is not a big threat in pvp anyway, given how many counters there are that make solo pvp pointless, if not impossible. the fact that you live in 0.0, and find one cloaked ship a threat is laughable and insane at the same time.forget it. i can't possibly support this, and can hardly believe that you blobbing superfarmers are that serious a group of sissies. maybe you're not 0.0 alliance at all, but whatever, i still wouldn't support it. cloaks are fine.@bot one: nice name. do you really not know that a cloaked vessel can't run any modules? or do anything, except, (assuming covert op's), warp and fly around, or move and cycle previously launched probes? if it's not a covert op's, then it can't even warp, and doesn't have the ability to even fly around at anything approaching normal speed. if it's black op's, it fits the just mentioned category, except that if it's sitting on top of you, it can decloak and lock you slightly faster than your average bs.in short, if it's cloaked it's not much of a threat until it decloaks, and if it's alone, it's probably still not much of a threat. in fact, you're probably qualing at a bantam. of course, those can light cyno's, but i still don't think you have much to worry about."
5/18/2011,"if you make it a module/weapon available anywhere then you instantly obsolete cloaks for defensive and offensive work both as well as their use in high-/low-sec regardless of how hard you make it --> bad idea.cloaking is mostly a problem for defensive operations as they not only provide intel platforms but also the ability to bridge/jump in attacks that are completely unscoutable.i have previously suggested a sov module that could send out a ping every so often, thus offering a small window in which even cloaked ships can be probed .. idea is to have it be a group effort that requires organization (think sub hunts during wwii).aah, the young'uns. such naivety. we had cloakers sitting in systems the day cloaks were introduced long before bots were even considered (ie. back when eve was a gnat of a mmo).invulnerable intel gathering in the heart of enemy territory .. is it any wonder it is abused to hell and back?"
5/18/2011,suport this
5/18/2011,"i approve of this. it's an elegant solution that fits nicely within the game mechanics and sounds like a believable mechanical issue (from a background fluff perspective. although i would suggest that ships that can fit cov ops should have bonuses that would enable them to sustain the stealth for a much longer duration, if not indefinately (enable cap recharge?). it would allow them to maintain their ship role and other players to identify an afk cloaker as a non threat."
5/18/2011,"i have a lot of experience using hybrid weapons.was playing around in eft the other day to see if i can get decent performance out of a pvp railgun ferox. other than making me vary angry after a few hours, i decided that these guns will be worth using if medium rails got a 20% dps boost and -10% to powergrid usage.otherwise, ac's and arties work just as well for most cases.found this suggestion, which seems incredible close."
5/18/2011,"not supported.the only thing that the op will do is turn ninja looting into a carebear activity, removing all risk from it (and lots of the reward, as well).this game is about player competition and conflict, which should end in ships exploding. the suggestion will just generate a bunch of smack in local, which is lame, tbh.there are far better suggestions a few posts below:-making wrecks tractable (but with flagging)-making wrecks blue after an hourbut these are not in the op.so, not supported."
5/18/2011,"as mentioned before in this thread, the game already has a ridiculous number of ships. i understand the desire for more shiny stuff, but the game would be better balancing the existing ships than making new ones.to properly pvp you need to have at least a cursory knowledge of a ship that you encounter. new players coming to the game are already overwhelmed by the number of ships they need to learn, only to learn later that many of them are useless."

5/19/2011,tracking disruptors could use a buff. i have never seen them take precedence over other forms of e-war. this is due to the limited ship types they effect(and is fine) and the reduction in incoming dps is nto comparable to damps or jamming.often even bonused ships do not fit many of these modules.i would like to see tracking disruption improved and be a viable contender to other forms of e-war mid slots such that they are actually used in fleet fights.even fast hac gangs would would pontentially benifit from these mods do not fit them over jams.edit: it's a ship balance thread...want me to whine about the lack of matar sunglass options?...or are you saying tracking links are used and are great and i'm misinformed and you fit them all the time(with a link to kill mail where these are fit)..i'll wait.or is yout beef that i fly a lot of matar ships? or that i don't point out rails are under used as already been pointed out? or would that be a boo hoo caldari whine?

5/19/2011,"well, you have the incentives in place already with the free trial and the free download of the client. some more incentive to play the game would be good, as gamers tend to know that an mmo is a commitment.trying to obtain gamers who do not want to play an mmo is not going to give you roi, what you need to do is obtain gamers who do want to play an mmo. from a trailer perspective, i think 'the butterfly effect' was a very positive step in the right direction and as you are using youtube and google analytics (or you frickin' should be!) i guess you can see what the conversions are like and what your traffic breakdown is like to the all-important 'download client' button.so, find what mmo gamers want and apply your marketing along those lines. a few knee-jerk thoughts would be:1) give the would-be mmo gamer confidence the game will not die out. so, stable independent company, measurable growth in game content, lively and committed player-base, etc. this will mean their investment of time will not turn into a barren wilderness, full of poorly managed content.2) adversity, challenges, rewards, variety [this is not covered enough in trailers - too much 'kaboom', eve has extensive pve] - make them feel if they download the trial and try it out there will be enough for them to do, with people to make friends and enemies with.3) no grind! i have yet to see this advertised anywhere. why? it is one of the key differentiators of eve to every other mmo.4) you've got the woah-factor down pat with the presentation, but are you focusing too much on the end-game/0.0 aspects when marketing? as much as it makes for exciting trailers i would be surprised if it would not alienate would-be mmo players who [at this moment in time] you just want to play the game, not create an alliance and take over the universe - you must be scaring some people off with that type of marketing. it's hard to know how to answer that without knowing what the statistics are:1) average subscription length2) average time to high end content [biggest ship]3) reason for leavingin general i'd say you could:1: look at their friends list and see if the people they associated with are still playing the game, so use the social aspect/angle. ""i will play again if i knew that my friends are still playing/active"" this could hypothetically have a double bonus to it, as the person who is still active could be thinking ""it ain't the same since xyz left...maybe i'll quit the game"" and 'boom' you just gave them their friend back.2: you've got the cost thing down just fine, so use another aspect...something tangible only for veterans, like 5 years plus sub time that is in game...waiting for them. i don't know what it could be, maybe a shuttle - hell even a 'veteran' tag in their info window or pink writing for chat channels! or even a veterans-only club when you do wis...just some sort of tangible game content which only veterans can have.make them feel special, singular...that you value their custom in some way other than just a free hall pass for a few days. they might have been demi-gods in control of a 1,000 starships at one point. make them feel that way again, make them question their decision to leave other than using cheap psychology.3: see what is in their hanger(s) give them an appraisal/market value in jita pricing - make them remember what they left behind, get them thinking. a pretty picture may paint a thousand words, but nothing you can think of will be anywhere near as awesome as the mind of a veteran with 1,000 hours of gametime under their belt. they know what they left behind, you just have to remind them about it - in a positive way.regards,ak"
5/19/2011,"tell stories.the butterfly effect was a good example. it was about how one person can make a difference. but, a lot of games do that: one player makes all the difference in the world... but then have no real examples of this happening. it's pretty common, and players expect that those kinds of stories are more fantasy than anything else. yeah yeah, i'm the one dude that can make the difference, ha ha, whatever...but eve is different - one player really can make their mark. i think it would be interesting to drive that point home using real examples from the game's history.eve is full of cases where a single person, or a small group of dedicated people, has accomplished something big. a series of advertising campaigns centered around real events may help generate interest.it is what interests people when i talk to my friends about eve. they know that ""it's that space ship game where you shoot people"" but not a whole lot more. talking about how nice the ships look, or how the market is player driven, or how sand-boxy the game is garners some interest, but nothing entrances them more than mentioning examples of how real players affect the game.the eve bank scandal is one that really seems to get people interested and say, ""wow... you can do that? that's awesome..."" perhaps not the most positive example, but a very interesting one that showcases how eve isn't like other games.pick some people that have done something notable, or run a well known organization. help them tell their stories in as engaging a way as possible. the faces of eve. a market mogul (akita t), a mercenary (pitboss, alekseyev, whoever runs pandemic legion), a pirate overlord (helicity boson, larkonis, mynxee, etc.), leaders from the nc and sc (and why they hate each other so much), the csm guys, whatever. and you can't forget chribba, the man with veldspar inked onto his arm for all eternity.okay, that last bit might be a bit creepy to most people, but you get the idea. it doesn't really matter who is chosen as long as it's interesting.one might also want to consider using the alliance tournament as a marketing tool more aggressively. it's free to watch, entertaining, and showcases some of the depth of eve's pvp system."
5/19/2011,"i dont know if this is a ui issue and i am sure it has been brought before, but the bookmarks trade is a pain, especially in a wh corp with bookmarks updated every day. for those who don know: a bookmark has to be moved first in your cargo, drag into your locations tab, ****+drag back in your cargo (pay attention not to delete it from your locations tab) and move back in the corp cargo for other people to use. we can save corp fits now, update complicate contracts across the galaxy but have to relay in manual copy of every bookmark."
5/19/2011,"there are two high-level things that **** me off to no end ever since i started playing eve.one, reuse the same components for similar functions. the text editing window in a channel motd acts a teeny bit different than the window to send a mail, and that acts a bit different than writing notes. my personal asset window looks a bit different than corp assets, and that does different things than the list of items in a contract.same applies to context menus: roughly half of the places where an item is mentioned only allow show info on right-click. some also allow view market details or find in contracts. i don't see why these options shouldn't be available everywhere.the second major issue is some windows not behaving. modal windows - get rid of them. why can't i edit a channel motd and copy-n-paste stuff from it from my notes? or just drag links to items or characters into it? why do i get interrupted by a popup window for something which leaves me unable to do anything, even chat, until i click it? and also iirc at least one of the industry windows has the same problem.a very related issue is some things not being in a ui window at all. i happen to like to have my local and other chat channels stacked on the left edge of the screen. this unfortunately means that the current system information is hidden behind them, and i need to move everything away when i want to run pi. these ""windows"" should be made into a proper window which then could be dragged.and related to that, make the target list a window too. yes i know you can move it around and even arrange it vertically, but there is no way to stop it from getting behind your other windows when you have too many things locked. it should be in a separate window which you could move and resize however you want, and the target icons would only fill that window (with scrollbars if necessary - just not appear behind other stuff!)"
5/19/2011,i would like to see the target boxes show the actual ship orientation relative to your current ship.thus one could see are they traveling away or towards or orbiting at a glance.
5/19/2011,first i do not want a customizable ui.no add on's no mods. take inspiration from these on other games and add them into the base ui but no no no no. it completely changes how you play the game and can automate far to many features.the method of entering star base passwords sucks. being able to enter 4 or so pass words and never touching it again until the gates change would be nice.a green highlight to the targeting for friendly effects(like the red when getting shot or yellow when targeted)a test fitting window to allow you to create fittings you do not have items for or can not fitbut can saveright now you have to be able to fit the ship to save it.more options for ship spinning.
5/19/2011,seems good
5/19/2011,"well my 2cents coint seems have twoo sides. i have seen you only mentioned one.here it comes:1st side of the coin:your gang failed to nail some supercap('s) on grid ( or meaby enemy was too clever take out all your hic's/dic's to get it out) and it did warped to ss and clock. it gained cap it needs to jump out and gtfo. so this scenario seems also frustrating to me so if i was you meaby i could also post on forum. thats why here you will get +1 from me.but if i turn the coint on the other side is see:you left nc/your corp, and trying to find some other place to be, or just simply want to restock your ships/gear from loses in hostile space. if you have to do with your logistic guys it will just take too long, you want action... and you want now. so you grab your thanatos open jumpplaner tool and find out that you have to make 2 jumps to get to the place where your gear is parked. but you also find out that the midpoint when you have to jump first wil be simply suiside without staing cloked for 2 minets because of the high trafic in it. yes you could afford to lose an cyno alt in there but defenetly not your carrier ""swiss army knife"". but then it hits you.... damn..... if i clock i will be never recharge my cap fast enough to get out before they find me.so you liad back...... look outside the window of your captain quarter at your shiny thanatos wich did serve you very well past years to bring your stuff around and feel you self powerless. you contact your logitic guys and just desite to wait couple of days till they get your crap to you.... sitting there in station.... doing nothing. only for that i give you here -1so to the summary: 1-1=0 thats basicly so much support you get from me.and yes i know my english is terreble, but it wont change the fact you did not think that there is always 2 sides of the coin.cyb."
5/19/2011,"i thought the whole point of covert ops cloaks is that they can warp while cloaked. that makes them special. i don't see how regular cloaks should have the same ability, without diluting the play balance advantage of cover ops cloaks.not supported.

5/19/2011,"the logic being that if they jump on someone in the standing fleet, everyone else in the fleet warps to them. besides, if they don't do anythign when the system is busy, just put all your bots in the one system and watch the afk cloaker never bother you again :)"
5/19/2011,"are you seriously asking us to consider taking out a legitimate part of the game mechanic just because it makes you psychologically unable to play? afk cloaking sounds like a perfectly sound tactic to me. one that you should counter by ignoring them ( take risk ) or hunting them down ( deal with the risk ). i'm sorry it just sounds like you are complaining that german u-boats are making your merchant shipping business difficult, and that god should make it illegal for germans to use u-boats."
5/19/2011,"i would love to be able to hunt them down. that is exactly what i am suggesting, having the ability to hunt them down. even if it is an excruciatingly long and hard job that is easily countered by the player that is cloaked making it all but impossible to catch a cloaked ship if the player is active, all i want is the ability to hunt them down."
5/19/2011,"maybe i'm being nitpicky, but then why did you not write that as your proposal, instead of the ""afk cloaking shouldn't be allowed as it violates the terms of service of the game"" sentiment that everyone else is reading."
5/19/2011,"hold on a minute....let me get this straight.you have a problem with afk cloakers, but you are now saying that it's all but impossible to catch them if they are *not* afk? (ie not in the scope of this discussion)??"
5/19/2011,"so i'm confused.the meaning of afk is ""away from keyboard"".if another player is away from his keyboard how is he bothering you?"
5/19/2011,"he's arguing that the psychological stress caused by a afk cloaker is enough to keep him from mining or ratting or going about his business. the argument goes that an afk cloaker doesn't have to do anything active (and be away from the keyboard) in order to achieve this effect. the statement was then made that he should just hunt down the afk cloaker and kill it. then the reponse is that they are actually hard to kill, if the person is at the keyboard and evading probing/detection. qed."
5/19/2011,"it sounds more like he's arguing that he can't comfortably set up his bot to do his ratting and/or mining for him so he can comfortably go afk while they do his work for him.and, to the op's ""against the tos"" bs argument: thousands of players in eve won't enter nullsec or lowsec because they know for damn sure that some groupo of griefers is going to destroy their ship, or ships, just for the f'n hell of it. it happens all the time, and not only prevents people from enjoying the game, but ****es them off. if that's not a problem, then i'm sure that this isn't.enjoy your day, and try not to get to upset about that little afk cloaker. as a nullsec player, i'm sure you are aware that an active player can just cycle dscan and look for the cyno on his overview should it actually pop up.everyone is always perfectly happy when the rules don't get in their way, as long as they can use them against someone else.kindly shove it, and stop posting this trash here."
5/19/2011,"nope, not supporting.there is no way to prove if someone is behind keyboard or not while cloaked.2ndly, a cloaked ship will in no way keep you from enjoying eve.. unless it well, decloaks and shoots the **** out of you. but that's just how eve should be."
5/19/2011,"you must not understand how this part of the game currently works. if you have a ship fitted with a cloaking device and can get into a system and off the gate, you can cloak up in that system and never be found. there is currently no possible way to find or decloak a ship unless you already know where they are. the idea of the many proposals i have brought to this part of the forum is having the ability to locate or decloak a ship in a way that would allow any active player to avoid detection but would prevent a player from cloaking their ship in a system and then walking away. afk cloaking is used to lull players in that system into a false sense of security by remaining online and cloaked for days or weeks on end with no activity(because they are afk) and then all of the sudden hot dropping a capital fleet. if you want to achieve this advantage you should have to be actively at the computer playing the game.also, ah yes the ""your a botter"" argument. keep bumping me back to the top"
5/19/2011,"no, cloaking should remain as it is now."
5/19/2011,"it's not factual, it emotional. you are suffering from fear, a response that you alone allow to occur.if they do attack your carrier, then they are not in fact afk.your problem is, you can see them in local. this plays on your weak kind, creating fear. if your all seeing eye wasn't as powerful, you would have this issue."
5/19/2011,"the cloaking is fine.what are you afraid of? that the cloaker uncloaks and attacks your mining/ratting ship? or that he cynoes something nasty to your system?for uncloaking and attacking the system is working as intended. you get to choose the place and time you attack. in exchange the cloak module gimps the scan resolution on non-bonused ships, giving you time to warp off. you do keep aligned while ratting in a system with hostiles, do you? vs stealth bombers and recons keep a corpmate in system (rat different belts and move to next system after the belts deplete) and you should be able to react in time to counter it.for cynoes the problem is not the cloaks but the cyno ability to drop multiple supercaps on a moment's notice. again, the cloak just gives you the opportunity to choose the best time to attack, nothing more. which is working as intended. this means you should be complaning about cynos and not cloaks. maybe you could add a cyno opening delay after you de-cloak but that's a subject for a different topic, and not necessarily a feasible one."
5/19/2011,"well, actually by a roleplay point of view afk cloaking is totally legitimate.imagine being a pirate, placing your ship and cloaking it waiting for the right prey.you know you have to wait hours... well... you are in a 300mt long ship... you get up from the bridge and you go to eat, **** , do whatever you want...every now and then you go back to the bridge and check the scanner... any prey? no... still waiting...by your point of view it seems to me that even being killed interferes with the ability for everyone to enjoy the game.i like being afraid of cloaked pirates, i dont want to know if they will attack me or not (afk), being able to know if there is an actual danger by looking at the local channel is a spoil."
5/19/2011,so do the gms agree with you or not?
5/19/2011,"i think i, and others, pointed out why your complaints point more to a concern about being able to bot in peace, than whether someone is going to cyno a supercap fleet on you. most self proclaimed afk miners btw, are also botters, despite their abusing it less and making an effort to seem otherwise. this is what happens to a generation that grows up on cheat codes supplied by developers i would guess. immortality, god-mode, unlimited bullets, etc.. they just can't play without such benefits.hacking, botting, and all the rest is extremely prolific, to the point of even admins on gaming servers using them, and having the benefit of not being subject to scans themselves. most people that get away with it, are the ones who claim otherwise and moderate their use to something resulting in, more or less, normal stat's. just a little better than average.so if we think you're really just a whining botter, don't be too surprised. botters tend to be insecure individuals that need their ego's stroked, which is part of the reason they bot in the first place. so they can be more successful, which makes them seem cooler to their peers, which leads to competition between botters, which leaves honest people looking like fools, which leads to botters stroking their own ego's calling honest people losers.this is where the terms 1337 and fail come from, or at least, from whence they originated. think about that, the next time you use them.right.. you're 'really' concerned about hot-dropping fleets. well, no worries, they have to decloak to light a cyno, and when they do they are completely vulnerable. you can get them then."
5/19/2011,"how much seconds its to get them after he declouks it that not even second, so no they not vurneble, yo ustil need target him and if cyno its up you have no chous as only die easy kill. so cloucers ned to have limited time to get targets not only sit in clouck for days loking for targets mostly off time afk siting afcors. if you look for thargets sit by pc and look on your char if no leave system."
5/19/2011,"your carebear mind didnt got the idea, the covert operations class has a reason - like having eyes on sth? every alliance has dozens of covops sitting around for hours to have eyes on hostiles, systems and stuff. pretty much they are afk most of time because they are all dual boxers and most of the time nothing happens. seriously just to protect your whiny solo ratting such a mechanic will just hit those who make something useful in this game. just to add a reason why you cant stop it. even if it would be possible, i wont support it because its just tears."
5/19/2011,"i think being able to sit in waiting is great, and i dont think there should be a change in peoples ability to sit and wait for an unsuspecting victim. i just dont think they should ba able to walk away from the game knowing that they can come back later. and if your role playing, you cant just walk away from your ship or go to sleep and not worry that you might be discovered."
5/19/2011,i suppose submarines should be nerfed irl?
5/19/2011,"yes because a submarine are very similar to cloaking devices what with the being completely invulnerable and undetectable and alloh wait, they can be detected by sonar and destroyed by depth charges and torpedoes. on second thought submarines are nothing like cloaked ships seeing as they actually have a weakness."
5/19/2011,care to stop whining yet?
5/19/2011,"no, actually i think they're pretty similar. you try finding a submarine sitting at the bottom of the pacific, when all you know is that it's in the pacific ocean.now, you try finding a spaceship that is running cloaked when all you know is that it's in a solar system. both are like finding an invisible needle in a haystack, before said needle ****s you up."
5/19/2011,"just give them a big fat boost on ewar drones per skill point. no one uses ewar drones (edit: apart from ecm) cause they suck, but if webwarrior do some real nasty webbing, a blaster boat could get in range easily edith 3: see how bad ewar drones are, just noticed there are only webbing berzerkers. fix that to to fix gallente"
5/19/2011,i support
5/19/2011,hi.in the last patch remove information on a pilot's standings towards npc corporations. i want that standings were visible if at pilots have mutual excelent standings.
5/19/2011,join the request
5/19/2011,why?
5/19/2011,"danika princip if i, for example, take the player in corporation, i should know his standingsit is the most simple example"
5/19/2011,why would you want to?
5/19/2011,o/
5/19/2011,bring back the intel tool!
5/19/2011,"would this help many of the issues with 0.0?dont plant many 'isk' moons, spread the wealth a little instead with a decent spread of usable moons that dont make super massive bankrolls. this may discourage the massive allainces and coalitions from moving in.it may encourage smaller entities to move in if they can hide out in a far flung reach of space. there are other ways fo making 0.0 more interesting, but many have been thrown out, but just making the galaxy bigger in general may help surely?this has no doubt been suggested before but i dont feel like trawlign through swathes of forum..."
5/19/2011,"honestly, they should plant more high end moons to drag the prices down. otherwise, this seems like a logical way to change the current null sec dynamic."
5/19/2011,"that does make sense yeah, i hadnt thought about just making tech etc more abundant, i was thinking along the lines of making lots of new space that isnt attractive to fat wallet coalitions, but will be attractive to smaller entities.possibly even making some areas of 0.0 that arn't connected to the rest of 0.0, and arnt in easy (or possibly at all) capital jumping reach? or cut off areas that are only reachable via a few well placed static wormholes? just thoughts to add new areas for people..."
5/19/2011,"or you could just make the ships travel slower, so the galaxy 'effectively' becomes bigger again?!blame ccp ps:"
5/19/2011,"i'd like to see more stars added to the edge of the eve map with increasing value the further you got out.1. it would give more space for smaller alliances to move into and not be bothered by massive empires already suffering from over crowding.2. combined with the truesec anom changes that just came out it would turn nullsec into an ""islands in space"" model with people clustering around the stars that had great truesec, which would make fighting over territory more important.3. it would make blobs slightly less likely because people would be less inclined to get batphoned in to curb stom a tiny alliance that is very far away.6. people would have to fully live out in nullsec making their own assets out there because making jita runs would be a little tougher. right now people just grind isk and fight over their isk grinding space out there."
5/19/2011,"actually i like travel speed as it is now, the first time i played i was quite surprised that it took less than 8 minutes to travel 1 au.i was expecting to see ships moving at sub-light speed inside solar systems.maybe i would change the autopilot, to get nearer the star gates... it should warp to 0mt, as the ship is actually able to do it.. (another weird thing)"
5/19/2011,the 15km limit is there to ensure that if you go afk you can be ganked. its fair.
5/19/2011,hell yes. why would the quafe corp give us free samples if we can't buy them?...wait a sec...are we guinnea pigs?
5/19/2011,supported because of hannah viktor's awesome post.
5/19/2011,+1more drugs in eve please
5/19/2011,"unlike the other non-actionable ""fix afk cloaks because i don't like it"" threads, this proposal actually has some merit and gives a possible way to address the problem.i would suggest though that a complete uncloaking (until they recloak) of the adversary is a little too powerful. the purpose of a black ops cloaker is to hot drop a fleet after all.perhaps make it such that each 'pulse' allows the cloaked ship to be combat probed for a small window in time, say 1-5min (subject to tweaking). you want the chance to be low enough such that unless you have a lot of people probing for him, you will need more than one pulse to pinpoint the cloaker. once found you can warp to him, but he is still cloaked, so you still have to find the ship in a 15km radius sphere.basically, the mechanic should fulfill the following points: (up for discussion)1) it should cost the pos fuel to do the pulse. (plus the module upgrade)2) it should make someone who is afk for more than 6 hours findable, but with difficulty.2) it should make someone who is afk for more than 12 hours findable with reasonable effort.3) it should make someone who is afk for more than 23 hours findable with relative ease.4) it should maintain that someone who is cloaked but not afk, almost impossible to find.5) not decloak the cloaker. (too powerful, would gimp bo ships, not to mention tough to implement technically)difficulty can be overcome by adding more people probing and scanning."
5/19/2011,"let me try to sum up all of the arguments against the concept of your idea, which is to nerf afk cloaking.-its not an actual problem, if they are afk just ignore them-afk cloaking is how we ""counter local""-only if you nerf docking-you must be a botterand all these arguments will come from the same 6 or so players, over and over and over again without making any actual points.lets see how close i am"
5/19/2011,"it is a counter to local, you just don't want to lose local.tell me this, putting aside the differences, just how many afk cloak threads to you see from wh dwellers? sure it's not the same space and entrance is not the same, but i'd love for you to point me to one."
5/19/2011,"that is a problem in eve you cant jsut ingnor them they atack to not only sit cloucked but between atacks can go serveral days or weeks, so everyone duing that time is strest i nthat systme point to get rid off them its that not interaction sit in system afk. they need to have soem time to gettatrget but not all the eve time."
5/19/2011,"if you ignore them/fly in groups they prepare a titan hotdrop for example:4tengu,2hugin,2 sabre,3scimitars, 4 ceptors + an option for more so ignoring them is not a real option.local should not be countered. there is a lot of other tactics, besides, if you want to do a hotdrop look at the screen and nothing will harm you, just recloak and continue watching the system. ""nerf docking"" i can't see the point here... you can fly to a pos/safespots.i'm not a bot, i'm against boting, but with 1 bastard afking in my systemminers went to empire and carebears running missions. and i personally think that afk cloakers are botters, i just want an option to kill the guy when he is afk.the actual point is afk cloakers disrupt a gameplay of many real people without taking almost any risk, the only option to counter them right now is to have a hotdrop ready titan on standby with large enough gang which is unrealistic for renters. the actual point is that afk cloakers given, imho, unfair advantage not in the cloaking part, but in afk part:they disrupt a gameplay for 24 hours/day without investing 24 hours a dayusually there is no retribution possible since overwhelming force hotdroppedi only want an option to fight them and not the whole alliance standing behind them."
5/19/2011,"the advantages of this method are: 1) it doesn't limit the current bo/covert tactics, you can hotdrop just look at the screen.2) no new game mechanics like ""scanable invisibility""3) with ballanced costs and timeouts it won't be worth/possible for using as a tactical tool, for example 30-90 min warm-up timeout(before pulse) + 5-10kk cost of fuel per pulse will probably make it not so powerfull.and again i want to stress the fact that, now we have no real option to defend ourselves, all the cards are given to attacking side.choosing the time, the place and the victim of an attack is good enough advantage, harrasing a players 24h/day is just an unfair bonus."
5/19/2011,another advantage came to mind: its an isk sink ;)
5/19/2011,"okay, you've convinced me jack oat.i'll give you the thumbs. your proposal is acceptable, with perhaps some tweaking to not affect campers of less than 23h (i think its reasonable for afk cloakers to stay in your system for a whole day, maybe they just dropped offline or something)so if this pulse can be done only once a day, then i think that would be acceptable."
5/19/2011,"wh is a bit different, you can't open cyno there.you can't jump whole bunch of people to a point of your choosing instantly, and send a capital reinforcement if needed.btw removing local goes both ways and choosing a weak target in almost empty systems becomes more of a challenge."
5/19/2011,"i must not have mentioned they were different. oh wait.cyno is a whole other matter and i have in fact suggested a change before in regards to this. but if they are using a cyno, they are not afk.i guess you couldn't find an afk cloaky wh thread. oh well."
5/19/2011,"bind mwd to f2, bind cloak to f1.as you reach a safe spot start moving in random direction.put rock on f1 and f2 keys.?profit"
5/19/2011,"local is removed in wh, but the attackers can't bring capitals.ballance is the problem, with afk cloakers ballance went to hell.i'm looking on the problem from a standpoint of a small space renting corp.all the cards are given to the attackers:they know the enemy, (cloaky recons when they aren't afk all over the place)they know themselves, they choose the time and the place of the battle, (usually when they overpower the enemy by numbers or quality or both)the only thing they don't have is ""i win now"" button. when being afk is not safe, at least local population could mobilize or hide."
5/19/2011,isn't putting a rock on keys called botting? ;)
5/19/2011,its not botting...... so far i know rock is an pure nature.ohh and not supported
5/19/2011,it's good really great
5/19/2011,"mags:if ccp gets rid of local i will be fine with it, but it wouldn't change the fact that having a ship in your system with no one behind the wheel that you have absolutely no means of hunting down and killing is a flaw."
5/19/2011,"but without local, you and your bots won't be able to tell there's a ship in 'your' system, not that you've ever been outside of highsec. without local, the cloaky uboat crowd can pop you before you know they are there."
5/19/2011,"really good idea, should do the deal of that bot cloacker(s) just sitting in afk paralizing all action in the system."
5/19/2011,it's really good idea!
5/19/2011,i don't see a problem here...1. online a cynojammer. 2. make common fleet for hunters to quickly react if someone is tackled.3. keep your pvp ships ready.that solves problems with afk cloakers.
5/19/2011,good idia
5/19/2011,"without local, afk cloaking would be pointless. so your argument is flawed, not cloaking."
5/19/2011,"well, sounds good. these measures will make carebare life in null-null sec a bit better and all this situation with afk cloakers more .... i don't know... honest towards real players :)"
5/19/2011,"fly to system in red space with highest number of npc kills (according to dotlan)log outlog in at peak activity (dotlan again)light cynobang, hotdrops without the warning that having a cloaky in system provides."
5/19/2011,"now attackers have a superiority over carebears and other ones. it's pointless to farm in 0.0, because u lose more than you earn there. it's impossible to wait them always and makes pvp boring for defenders. there is a little difference. in this situation there's enough time to dock)))"
5/19/2011,"i mentioned the fact there are differences, but lack of local still means no afk cloaking.it matters not what position you look at it from, local is the reason for afk cloaking. it is the counter to local to try and subvert it's 100% risk free instant intel.you initially hold all the cards. you know they are there, you have the all seeing eye called local. you can see when they enter local and when they leave. but your reliance upon local to give you instant intel, is being somewhat subverted through the use of afk cloaking. that's why they have to resort to afking, to try and put you off guard.if that ever happens, you'll have way too much power on to of your already powerful intel tool called local.i can see you hate the idea, of losing your all seeing eye."
5/19/2011,"so, it's really just the hot-drop capability of enemies right on your front-door that is the problem here.. not the lone afk-cloaker in your system.so, in essence.. spool up/down timers for cynos/jumpbridges so that you have a slight chance to get away.make a new proposal and aim it at the root of the problem: cyno-mechanics."
5/19/2011,"have you ever lit a cyno?you sit there for quite a while, you can't warp, move, or dock. if it's a regular cyno anyone in system can warp to you. if it's a black ops cyno you have to light it in a moderately expensive ship that you have to let sit there for a while.ways to counter a hot drop1. go mining / ratting in groups, never alone.2. get in a standing fleet.3. get on voice comms with your alliance.4. when someone hot drops you yell ""help help! warp to me!"" into comms. if your alliance is paying attention you'll be able to fight back.5. bait them. do steps 1 2 and 3 but have your own fleet standing by. go ratting in something juicy but with a good tank (carrier, marauder). when the hot dorp starts, get your tank up, warp in your fleet, drop some bubbles, and start killing.6. don't be a botter"
5/19/2011,"ok man,i get it, you don't like local.i don't like ppl looking for easy prey so what?if local will be removed we'll adapt or just move on... the important question: is what you prefer to do(looking for easy prey) is the only thing people should do in this game? if not, they should have a chance to do it."
5/19/2011,"yes i have.you have to sit there 5 min in a recon. while logistics patch you up, an they are there in a matter of seconds.1) done that, titan dropped a gang with logistics an t3, two faction and two regular bs were down in matter of seconds. (cyno jammer could solve the problem for 20kk/day)2) our local fleet is smaller and less organized than what falls on us, the attackers are really brave guys ;) also they have a supercap reinforcements probably.3) are you renting space? have you heard of cta? in short not really possible. 4) same as 1) 2) and 3) if they hang around then probably they baiting you into bringing some reinforcements to kill them with what they have or with another hotdrop.5) same as all of the above. the guy who was afk cloaker in our system left it and cought a mothership next day, he had 8 supercaps on standby + support. so something with ""good tank"" would be dead in less than a minute.6) not a botter. but with afk cloakers it doesn't matter.in other words, what you are saying is obvious, has been done or impossible in given situation.the basic problem is that attacker chooses to attack, it means from his point of view he has 100% chances to achieve his goals, and have a backup plan just in case."
5/19/2011,"yes loads of cloaking threads already. hopefully this will be a compromise for the afk cloaker haters and cloaky pilots. this post has some ideas taken from other threads to kudos to where it is due.non-covert ops cloaks- for anything other than a black ops battleship impose more penalties to the ship equipped with them. decrease scan resolution, increase sig radius and reduce targeting range by a factor of 4 when not activated and prevent capacitor regeneration while cloaked. remove scan res penalty on the module and no capacitor penalty to black ops bs (semi-ninja blops buff!!). no cycle timer.covert-ops cloaks- introduce a cycle timer on the cloak and introduce no capacitor regeneration penalty while cloaked. cycle timer may be 5-20 minutes and cloak drains 10% of cap per cycle. if cap runs dry ship decloaks.for covert-ops cloaks the changes are there to ensure that the pilot is not inactive. at the same time penalties are not severe as to gimp the use of covert-ops ships in pvp. leaving your ship in space for a short break is fine but leaving it too long will get you blown up. the reasoning for this is that the advantage of having the element of surprise 23.5/7 is much too overpowered is someone is not at the computer. however, even if you are semi-afk doing something else you'll still be there to hear the ""capacitor is empty"" warning in time to reactivate the cloak. the entire point of this is that cloaks are used more tactically and the presence of a cloaky ship will mean impending pvp activity rather than a perma-neut cloaked up in local. if you want to have the advantage you'll have to be at the computer. perhaps this will make cloakers even more feared because now you know there is someone at the keyboard. watching. you.tl;drchanges will not impact people who are:- running cloaky tackle- gathering intel in a cloaky- stealth bomber pilots- flying black ops battleships (they dont need nerfs)changes will impact people who are:- at work while cloaky alt sits in localchange aims to:- encourage actual pvp (hotdrops, scan-point-boom) rather than cloaking up and doing nothing.- more use of the black ops hulls since these are the only ones that are able to do the afk cloaker thing."
5/19/2011,"only truly affects the active cloaker and promotes the use of macros.nothing new suggested and not supported while ever local is the all seeing, 100%, risk free, instant intel tool it is now."
5/19/2011,"so your solution is to remove local? unless you know how to program a macro to check dscan, warp around evading angry locals while the capacitor charges up i don't foresee macros being an issue."
5/19/2011,"odd - you mention compromise in your op, then propose to make covops cloaks unusable. which positions, exactly, are you compromising between?"
5/19/2011,"there is no compromise required between the two camps.cloaking works just fine the way it is. it's local that causes the issue, so remove that."
5/19/2011,"hekira:the six people who troll the threads in this forum are not interested in compromise. they want nothing to change, except what they think needs changed. even when you say you agree that what they want to change should be done along side your idea they will still disagree. they want things to go their way and only their way."
5/19/2011,"don't listen to this guy, he's either a botter or an idiot who has never left highsec. personally, i suspect the latter.anyway, yeah. cloaking is working as intended."
5/19/2011,challenging **** poor ideas is considered tolling. c/d?
5/19/2011,if this is a compromise... i highly recommend a future in politics in the united states. i believe either the democrat or republic party has need of your viewpoints on compromise.
5/19/2011,"we've all been there -- sitting around probing down a system thinking that you're all cloaked up and safe, when all of a sudden you look down: ""wtf!!! i've been a sitting duck all this time?!"" somehow, you've been decloaked.the current indication that you no longer have a cloak active is that the faint pulsing green circle just stops pulsating... that's it. extremely easy to miss.i propose some sort of instant notification that alerts you upon accidental decloaking. what's accidental? anytime you decloak without explicitly deactivating the mod yourself. this notification should be a sound accompanied by a text popup (like what happens for combat) -- kinda like what happens with the audio shield/armor/structure alerts.or, make some sort of effect on your ship. right now, when you decloak, your ship slowly fades back to opacity. maybe if there was some sort of flash or something emitted from your ship (chaulk it up to cloak malfunction due to close-by objects).it would be nice to know as you're sneaking up to a kill when you've strayed a little to close to space debris, that way you can make a quick decision on what to do rather than continue thinking that you're cloaked.thoughts?"
5/19/2011,"i'd be in support of some kind of sound or even an interface flicker.but you won't get much support for this, because apparently cloaking makes you evil."
5/19/2011,"yay support!about the ebil cloakers, this has nothing to do with the current ""afk cloaker"" whining. i agree something needs to be done about those, but this is obviously for people who are actively doing something (thus, more in danger of being decloaked).let me just state this here: this enhances the current cloaking mechanics to better do what they are meant to do - being sneaky. it has nothing to do with afk cloaking. =)"
5/19/2011,"oh not another ""im noob pls fix the game so it does everything and autofix my mistakes "" thx but not"
5/19/2011,"been playing this game for a while now, and i love my cloaky ships. i'm fairly skilled with them (as in experience and not sp). but i still make mistakes which cost me to uncloak without my knowing it, when i'm hunting someone in an anomaly and trying to dodge the space junk or simply sitting there scanning. unless i want to look down every second to see if my cloak is still active, there's no way to really know if you've been decloaked (obviously, your ship being opaque would give it away, but it takes a few crucial seconds for it to apply)i don't think what i'm proposing is ""dumbing eve down"". it's a simple enhancement. it will not automatically recloak you or anythign, just let you know when you've been uncloaked. simple as that.i guess under your argument you shouldn't know the health of your ship. knowing the health of your ship will allow you to make better judgement calls. well, knowing when you've been decloaked will allow you to do the same thing.just sayin'"
5/19/2011,there's a fairly distinctive sound that plays when you (de)cloak.
5/19/2011,"i'm aware, but that require the camera to be riding up the ass of your ship. kinda like how you can only hear combat if you're zoomed in. when you're zoomed out, can't hear anything..."

5/19/2011,"you want to stop botters, go for it. go to their system, and cloak up your ship. it will have the exact same effect. i just dont think that while you are doing that you should be able to walk away from your computer and leave your ship cloaked in system. if you want to stop their cash flow then sit in there, and when you need to go find someone else to replace you.sad that the only real argument you can come up with so far for nerfing afk cloaking is to through accusations of botting. which by the way is not an argument at all."
5/19/2011,"you're throwing accusations around, i'm just mocking your reply. hence why i stated it was daft. you really should stick to one thread chap, your having great difficulty keeping up and comprehending."
5/19/2011,"so for now i see myultiple ideas in forum how to stop afk clouckers:1. fuel requements for cloucks.2. capregenration, but that tings not eat much cap eny ways they will recap about in 30 sec to atack soem one, so i dont tink so that wil stop eny afk cloucker.3. pos module with pulse do decklouck ships for soem time if he is afk than hee wil net reclouck if not hee wil clouck.i wil say one more tin afk cloucker its the same as botter, hee generates kill mails esay way by not p;aying a game actualy. i tink personaly need to be cionsidered as bots to."
5/19/2011,"this idea is a win / win for everyone.more revenue for ccp and the possibility of adding another sink for plex. this would in turn drive demand and plex price up adding incentive to ""buy"" isk the legal way and reduce rmt appeal.also, people wouldn't need 3+ accounts for temporary goals to then transfer the characters off."
5/19/2011,would be awesome!
5/19/2011,why would it put more load on the server?if anything it would reduce it as a) there would be less market orders b) most people would not have enough.also we're talking about easy calculations here not like the ones done in pvp.is player wallet > buy order minimum amount sound easy to me.in effect it's just an expanded search function.
5/19/2011,"well, i don't have the time to go deep into concurrent software design here in this forum, but in short, sure, the caluculation is 'simple' but think about how many times it needs to be done. basically, everytime anyone's wallet total changes, the system needs to check (pretty fast, can be done on the client) all your open orders, and update (the slow part) all the ones that need to have their colour changed.there is already a throttle for too many order changes in a short period of time (traders will know that you can only change an order once every ~4 minutes) this delay is to give ample time for the views on everyone else's market display to reflect the change (everyone online, thats 33,000+ clients) otherwise you will have race conditions. (that still happens sometimes), and somebody may try to fill orders that are no longer there.so imagine if everyones wallet updates caused a slew of order updates. (with maxxed out trade and retail skills, you can have over 66 orders open). that would mean that we would have to throttle wallet transaction updates to less than 1 per 4 min as well, otherwise the resultant order changes would not be able to keep up."
5/19/2011,"i think your over analysing this, the load would be minimal at best.you can argue your point all you want but i don't think your right."
5/19/2011,"ccp wants pvp and their ideas of how to bring it is beyond silly. the easiest way to increase pvp is to break down the power blocks.how?max number of members per alliance: 1,000max number of better then +0.0 standing an alliances can have toward other alliances: 3corps can not join if the membership of that corp puts it over the cap.members can not join a corp if it brings the alliance above it's cap.ccp removes all -10.0 to 0.0 alliance to alliance standings and all corps follow alliance standings toward other alliances. this way alliances are either blue or they are not.ccp removes all standing based docking and jump bridge network usage to only allow blue use only.this limits the max size of a power block to 4 alliances for a max of 4,000 pilots. with 4 alliances with their own leadership goals and interests then you can start to have real competition and real pvp in 0.0. sure a single 4,000 pilot alliance can break in to 4 and still be a single alliance under 4 banners but they would now become a power block unto their own and not be capable of setting others blue.power blocks could work together but without true blue standing then they are not gonna be able to live in close proximity and work with each other sharing bridge and station access. this makes for at best.. temporary alliances between power blocks. anything long term would not be possible.sure maybe the details or numbers can be tweaked and the idea can be finessed but the idea itself is the only reasonable way to break up the power blocks and bring pvp back to 0.0."
5/19/2011,"red is now blue. change defeated.you can't stop people from having friends, and adding in artificial limits like this is just begging for people to metagame around them.what would you do about the corps that are bigger than you would allow alliances to become? how would you stop current alliances just merging everyone into one corp? why is this needed when there is plenty of warfare going on already? (drf/pl/friends vs nc/dc/friends, drf vs aaa, whatever the hell is going on in the southeast etc etc)"
5/19/2011,how about just disallow alliance standings across the board?
5/19/2011,"as long as many players want to be in a bloc no ""limit hammer"" will work. its the way those players like to play the game. make medium scale stuff more attractive and some players may leave the blob."
5/19/2011,"i think a better way to encourage pvp is to fix the bounty system. it's less disruptive to the existing structure of the game, and adds depth and new career paths to the game."
5/19/2011,ccp does not seem to think so. the last 2 patches have been geared to generate more of it.ccp can limit bridge and docking to better then 0.0 standing to prevent alliances from outside power blocks from sharing resources. only one 0.0 outpost in eve allows docking to all atm as far as i know.ccp removes all alliance to alliance standing short of blue so your alliance is either blue or neut. thats how 95% of 0.0 operates anyway.how is it handled now? if the executor corp ceo has more in his alliance then he has skills for what happens?
5/19/2011,no. red/orange lists are used to count pilots of different alliances in local. something you need in medium scale stuff quite a lot.
5/19/2011,a very minor loss of easy/quick intel to bring the overall amount of pvp up i'd say.
5/19/2011,if alliance don't want to be in a block they don't blue other alliances..
5/19/2011,"exactly, so make it more attractive to stay independent. just limit the bluelists wont work as long as players want to blob."
5/19/2011,"its only more attractive to stay independent if you do not want to hold space. otherwise your a 1,000 man alliance max that needs to thwart the attacks of a 4,000 member power block or a temporary coalition of power blocks interested in cutting up your space.outside of sov warfare... as a power block your pool of available pvp pilots is smaller, less space is owned so less space between you and hostile alliances, and the number of blues is greatly reduced to support you. this all brings the pvp you can expect to go way up.in sov warfare... how exactly do you blob if the fleet size is limited to 255 and other fleets on the field that are comprised of temporary allied but non-block alliances will show neut to you on the battlefield? what would be the motivation of block alliances assisting others in taking space if they can't fly through it, use bridges, or dock in it's outposts without appearing neutral and being shot at after the space is taken?"
5/19/2011,"you still have tickers on overview, yes it will suck but not nc nor drf or whatever will start to become the next generation of uber medscale pilots. its not the way those pilots want to play eve. no idea whats the motivation to be just a number out of thousands and wasting tons of time for someone that hardly knows you at all. but many players seem to like it this way"
5/19/2011,"if standing changes were in forced then power blocks of 24+ alliances over 5+ regions could not exist. one alliances owning all outposts in 4+ regions could not exist. the logistics and bs to maintain full time coalition of power blocks under a changed system would be too much for people to deal with realistically.for instance... picking a random region out of dotlan. branch is sov'ed by 6 alliances for a total of 13,800 characters. under the change it would need to be a minimum of 14 alliances and 4 power blocks. sure razor does not live in branch so they would need to pass some ownership of their stations to other alliances or try and maintain them with 3 other power blocks of as many as 10 alliances in region not having docking rights. 3 other power blocks would need independent bridge networks. their would need to be a cross block intel channel but no one could be sure if names linked were truly neut or not unless they showed info. everyone in the region would have to show info on every new neut in local to see if it is truly hostile or one of the 10 alliances that are in the other 3 blue power blocks. sov pvp would be insane because you would have 14 different alliances in a group of fleets all trying to filter the overview by alliance. you could not filter by distance, by ship, or by any other overview option.why would you go through the trouble of maintaining something like that? what would be the benefit? the power blocks would break up and stay broken up except for temporary coalition to take space to break it up amongst the coalition. their would be no way to maintain them full time. only 4 alliances in the game would be effected by the cap and would have too many to form a block of their own. all of witch have a single 2000+ member corp or could drop the sub 50 member corps and easily make it under the wire."
5/19/2011,"yeah, because we don't already use more out of game tools than in game tools to organize blocs. removing the few things we use in game is going to do next to nothing. there may be more pressure to merge up a few of the smaller alliances, but overall, nothing will change."
5/19/2011,"how could you maintain coalitions as they are today of your limited to having 4000 member blocks, you can not set blue to other blocks, and no other blocks or alliances can can share resources like bridges and outposts?"
5/19/2011,"well, now that you have killed any alliance wanting to live in the deeper areas of null, ruined the fun for a large number of people and destroyed the several thousand pilot battles eve is famous for, what are you going to do?"
5/19/2011,sov 0.0 is for mighty player empires. complaining about alliances controlling 0.0 is like complaining about lo-sec being full of pirates.
5/19/2011,they squash pvp 98% of the time. when they do clash it is 5000 people hitting a node until it dies.
5/19/2011,deeper alliances will have to be more self sufficient and less reliant on the 20 jump bridge jumps it takes to get to high sec to buy a drake from jita. but thats a challenge and hardly a drawback as most of the best null sec space is deeper into null sec.
5/19/2011,either post with your main or admit you have never set foot in 0.0
5/19/2011,"nullsec as it is is incapable of being self sufficient. there are not enough manufacturing slots, research slots etc. breaking up the coalitions will leave alliances with even less manufacturing ability than they currently posses, making them even more reliant on jita. of course, if you had ever been to nullsec, you'd know that."
5/19/2011,i have been in null since june 07. i am currently in one of those alliances where i have to take 12 bridges to get to empire. if you need to know my in game name so you can try and tear down my reasoning then your flawed. my last large engagement we attempted to abort a super in production. the lag was so bad that even tho we had more then enough people to kill the tower the mod lag was so bad the pos managed to shield tank the fleet. i think i managed 12 volleys in an hour.
5/19/2011,people will find ways around these artificial restrictions.a better way to go is dynamic truesec. do away with system upgrades and respawning anoms. overfarmed systems degrade in quality while untouched systems become cookie jars. make it so that you can make a hundred times more what you can make otherwise in a bad system. sure it'll make life harder for 0.0 carebears and screw up renting arrangements but thats what ccp wants right?
5/19/2011,"was that the attack on a csaa somewhere deep in delve while it still existed? doomsdays cycling faster than artillery? i remember that one.i also remember a huge number of smaller and much, much more entertaining fights i've been involved with as a member of the dc. none of those involved squashing pvp, or cramming 5000 into a system. your suggestion would kill the game for me, and i doubt i'm the only one. why do you hate fun?"
5/19/2011,"while i firmly believe we need more incentive to get into 0.0, and more diversity in 0.0 too, i think that once you start to dictate how people play, you lose the elements that make eve what it is.if people want to blob, then you must let them blob, the trick is to allow more play styles in more areas, so the blobers can go ahead and lag each other out an dth erest of eve have plenty of options to go about how they want to play/pvp/pve.im against forcing things like how many friends or members you can have. the nc and so on are like they are because that is how they want to play eve. the smaller coalitions and alliances are like they are becasue that is how they want to play, neither should be forced to play any other way."
5/19/2011,"i think ccp's idea of what 0.0 should be is alliances in a perpetual shift across the map. a universe where pvp is more common. where its a struggle to maintain space and have a lasting presence in 0.0. today we have almost no shift and we have power blocks that cover hole quarters of the eve map with alliances that have been in the same place for 2-4+ years. for the time being, we have fights when we want them.. if the holidays or the summer is coming up some power block will invade some pet to make things interesting for a few weeks. outside of that... they play games pitting their pets against each other in hopes of drawing the other out to fight.outside of sov warfare... being a part of a power block now a days means hostiles are 2+ regions away. the only time you see them is when you camp a null sec entrance, make an epic multi-hour roam out of blue regions, or when the hostiles come to you. when they do come to you they are not looking for fights but to gank or grief so they never engage if it looks remotely like an even fight.i like this idea. ccp wants more pvp but is going about it by playing with sec, sov, bridges, and actually effecting the profitability of 0.0 to create conflict and reducing the risk vers reward."
5/19/2011,you have no idea what you're talking about.
5/19/2011,"blob is such a relative term. how many people do you really need to take down a pos, sbu, or tcu? if the block sizes are capped and somewhat balanced then the need to bring in friends and blob up local over 1k people will be lower. your still talking about blocks as big as 4,000 members each battling it out. even if you only get 10% of your membership on a cta you're still talking about 400 vrs 400 people in local easy. lots of fun and its not gonna crash nodes or cause heavy mod lag at all."
5/19/2011,stop trolling. p v p is in 0.0. fix empire p v p. allow bombs and caps.
5/19/2011,"i think a simple change that would be greatly appreciated, by me at the very least. for ceo/directors to have the ability to check corp standing history, currently it displays the date at which a corp standing was changed and by how much, but doesnt show by who, surely it would be a simple thing to add a column showing which director changed the set standing, as corps grow bigger more members get more rolls and become trusted, but a recent spout of blue alliances and corps being set red to my corp has made me want this ability,"
5/19/2011,completely agree. moar empty space to everyone.
5/19/2011,op is demonstrating afk cloaking.
5/19/2011,"s is a good letter, but going to have to lock up the thread for no content."
5/19/2011,i will always support any idea that removes stargates. i like the idea of universal jump drives using stars in lieu of cynos.
5/19/2011,"while i admit i am intrigued, a very significant amount of eve's pvp occurs on stargates. where do you ancipate the focal points for combat would occur, after such a change? stations? belts? anomalies? anchored sovereignty units?what mechanism would you implement to allow defenders to restrict access to their sovereign space, if any?i'm not opposed to the idea, i just feel like it needs more fleshing out. gatecamps are boring. =\edit: perhaps defenders could anchor an ""interdiction gravity well"" which would intercept hostile jump signatures from a given solar system. such structures would become the new focal points for pvp? just a thought."
5/19/2011,"looks very star trek and star wars like warp/hyperspace.i support it. you can do that for safety reasons you can jump to the outer margin of the solar system... it would make defense harder but it is space, there should be not bottlenecks."
5/19/2011,"interesting, but very disruptive to the way the game is played currently.you mentioned that bubbles will drop people out of warp anywhere in the line of travel. but how will people get to that location in the first place to drop the bubble? will you allow arbitrary travel between stars? when will we get a supercomputer cluster powerful enough to represent a grid the size of the eve galaxy? the computational power necessary would be (forgive the pun) astronomical. we would need a god simulator."
5/19/2011,"i like these kinds of ideas in spite and partly because they'd turn the entire game on its ass.sadly, changes this drastic won't actually happen. ever."
5/19/2011,"very interesting idea (and would love it in another game), but i like eve more as it is now."
5/19/2011,"supported in principle, but the idea needs to be refined."
5/19/2011,"i'll support this in principle because i do like the idea, but to echo others, this will never happen in this game. not the least of many reasons being that the warp speeds in the game would have to change unless you want to spend 8 days game time traveling 100 light years between stars in a 9au/s ship."
5/19/2011,"the same places as before, but with the addition of the sun (and removal of the gate) in each system. it just won't be like camping a gate, they will actually have to take risks as the camper and not just rr cluster as done now.i personally like the idea of being able to anchor a pos at the sun of a given system (if you have sov in it) and that pos can cover the entire 'jump in' zone of the star.amen my alt friend.that is one thought. changing probing to be more about pursuit is another. allow a probe to basically be a destructible 'drone' that homes in on a target you specify. you simply have to warp to the drone at the right time to catch the prey.another thought is that when a jump drive spools up, it sends out a cyno style signal to everyone in the system. each ship class could have their own spool up time with titans taking up to 180 seconds. frigates maybe 20 seconds. this would allow interceptors to intercept most ships and the larger ones would take long enough for a dictor or hic to reach them anyway.another thing is that i only usually support the removal of interregional and interconstellational gates. inside a given constellation the gate system is still intact. which allows certain systems to be off limits for jump travel, such as jita, while not disallowing access entirely."
5/19/2011,"if you let me do an extreme comparison, imagine eve ships as soldiers, sc are tanks. tanks do need 3-5 soldiers inside, but are very powerful, as sc...sc should need 3 capsuleers to be used.one pilot, one weapons and one systems."
5/19/2011,that would be so boring

5/19/2011,"good idea, i tried send a bit to corp wallet, but it's a pain to mangage. would be way easier having it sill on char wallet, but on different tabs."
5/19/2011,"the number of corp wallets needs to be looked at as well. ideally, the number of both personal and corp wallets should be customizable (with a sensible cap, say, 16?). in order to reduce database load (which is why i'm guessing we don't have personal wallets), just make it default to one wallet. the vast majority of players and one-man corps will never use more than one, which leaves more db space for the industrial-minded entities."

5/19/2011,"i think there is something in your proposal, but it should be much better developed.this is all very vague and indefinite. maybe if we get the chance to borrow isk npc corp where we have a good standing for some kind of an interest rate of 2 to 3% that we would pay out weekly or monthly.interest would of course varied depending on the npc corp standing, the amount of isk, and the length of time in which we will borrow isk, and of course the monthly or weekly payments.of course, borrowing would only isk that you do not need or do not use and you could always pull it back, if you take it before the expected interest payment,you would not have got the interest for that period of time."
5/19/2011,at least you came out and openly said you wanted big daddy ccp to give you zero-risk profits.
5/19/2011,"i see here the problem that noobs wil much loan isk and niot give it back, so to say that risky for npc corps to give out anormus amounts off isk witout eny garantys. there need to be garranty system that you give that money back to."
5/19/2011,"how will you combat inflation? hyper inflation takes down economies in rl. (zimbabwe comes to mind). if you want to do this then (as this is a virtual world) you can increase the amount of ore in the universe to keep in step with the increase in isk in the system. but your going to hit a point where there are not enough miners to pull the ore out of the rocks to keep up. those who have enough extra cash to put into the bank are going to get a lot richer than those who do not have enough isk to bank.you cannot put new isk into the economy without an associated isk sink. ie these banks are going to have to give out loans. which as i said in my earlier post, is not that easy, as it is prone to scams.i do agree there should be some sort of trusted credit system, which was one of my points in my other thread about new money laundering laws, but its all too complex to implement without a proper crime and punishment system.risk free interest rate, not supported."

5/19/2011,"personally i think they should put accel.gates for sov warfare to control which shiptypes or how many ships can enter battlefield, as in the tournaments. would control lag and make more fun pvp. great sov holders would be the most skilled pilots or those who throw most isk in the fights."
5/19/2011,"what makes you think we won't drive you off the moons in .4 as well?edit:really. i mean, seriously what makes you think granting access to more moons will cause a change in the balance of who holds them? what differentiates us from you is not wealth, it's numbers, will, and coordination. nullsec alliances don't have one tower or two towers we have hundreds. we don't mine a couple moons in system x, we mine every moon with resource y in region z. when we move into a region we send people out to scan everything, literally, everything, to assess what is worth taking, and then we lay out a plan to take it all. reinforce five towers a night, build our own, etc etc etc.we've taken what you want to do as a single or small tower count operation and multiplied it dozens of times over. if ccp increases the number of moons available for mining, it will not translate into tiny generic corp x getting a moon and finally striking it rich. it will result in big alliance y sending all of its scouts to all the new systems and then later that same week they'll have built towers there and you're back to where you're at now. staring at a bunch of towered moons you can't have because you have not the will, numbers, and coordination to take them.deal wiz it."

5/20/2011,"hopefully you guys aren't too much into the talks, but here goes...i agree that there should be multiple stations in player owned sov as a possiblility and that they should be buffed. there also needs to be the possibility of building an industrial empire from a smaller starting point. i suggest... mini pos's. these ""pos's"" have no protective shield. these use a small ""control center"" versus a tower. this is essentially a small modular pos with less cpu and powergrid. either it could use the regular pos mods or it could use a new set of mods. the mini pos will overall have less defensive capabilities and will operate independently from one another.multiple mini pos's can be setup under the control of a single pod pilot. manufacturing and research can be done with such mini pos's at a significantly higher rate than normal pos's due to not having to maintain a shield. the mini pos's fuel requirements are significantly reduced compared to a small pos. moon mining:these mini pos's should also be able to do moon mining albeit a bit differently. instead of the regular select mineral type and start mining it will be more like planetary interaction in that the yields and positions of various minerals change overtime. each moon has a maximum mineral output that can deplete if used too much, although the moon recovers overtime. therefore, the mini pos's moon harvesters will need to be repositioned every few hours or sooner depending upon depletion rates. such moon mineral changes only effect the mini pos's, regular pos moon mining is unaffected by this change. since mini pos's are so exposed they are always open to being attacked and looted by small marauding parties. mini pos's can only be placed so close to each other to prevent overcrowding and to allow the possiblity for a small marauding group to eventually grind through an entire defensive complex. mini pos's will have a much more rapid onlining times as compared to regular pos's for more active use and readjustments. this will allow for small installations to be rapidly deployed and undeployed to avoid hostile gangs. overall, this should allow for nearly infinite production in nullsec and lowsec with a low startup cost. this should allow nullsec to be the industrial juggernaut of new eden."

5/20/2011,"idea is nice on paper, but silly in eve. big ships are horribly bad to manouver around anything, since due some game mechanic, range from ship is calculated differently from the bumbing mechanic. you can be like 4kilometers from object, but cannot approach it anymore, since some imaginary boundary is already touching it (even though gfx is not).for example big ships like ragnarok cannot directly approach ship maintenance array on a pos, because the ship gets bumbed by the ship maintenance before its in range.also you can fit like one titan (gfx wise) between two titans, but still the two titans are 0m from each other.if game would handle bumbs and ship boundaries correctly, bigger size would be nice. with the current mechanics, no."
5/20/2011,great idea
5/20/2011,"can submarines be located with sonar?i'll answer that for you since you don't seem to know anything about submarines. yes. i lived on one for 2 years and i can tell you no mater how perfectly still you sit on the bottom of the pacific you can be found. it may take a long time and huge amount of effort, but it can be done. further, the ability of a submarine to all but disappear takes a large amount of effort from the crew and commander and is nothing remotely similar to the lack of even presence necessary to remain invisible and invulnerable with a cloak.a cloaked ship in absolutely no way can ever be found. there is no amount of time and energy that would let you find a cloaked ship and destroy it.thank you for further ilistrating that a cloaked ship being able to stay cloaked for an infinite amount of time with no interaction from the player is a flawed mechanic"
5/20/2011,"dear t'raq mardon-i have repeatedly asked you questions like:1) if he's ""away from keyboard"" as you suggest, how can he be a threat2) how do you know if he's there or not.3) how does someone not at his keyboard impinging on your ability to play eve.your continued tactic of avoiding my questions is what leads people in your threads to believe you are an angry bot user who can't get his program to run properly due to a cloaked person in your system, or that you are too incompetent to even plant a trap for your visitor to test him and then decide for yourself if you want to go about your business.its odd, to people like you, its ok that you should be able to rat and mine freely, and you cry for the ability to uncloak your adversary, and yet, if i were to come to your space and demand you fight, you would meekly hide in a tower or station, avoiding the fight at all costs."
5/20/2011,"1) because him being in game should imply that he is active and is a threat, as it is now it simply implies that he could be active and looking for a fight, which i would be glad to partake in, or more likely, he is inactive and simply floating out in space with no possible consequence to him.2) the entire point is that you don't, because he doesn't have to remain active to continue to faint the threat posed by an active player3) because he can come back to his keyboard when ever he chooses and become active, he must there for be treated as if he is active 23/7, an effect no actual player can have on a system. you must act as if there is an active red in your system who has the intent to either hot drop you or otherwise attack anyone he sees as an easy target. this slowes industrial work(industrial ships are weak and therefor must have a small gang for protection) and discourages anomaly running (any ship or group of ships capable of running sanctums easily would make for a juicy target for a hot drop). this slows isk income for the entire corp considerably, and all this can be done by a single player, who isn't even actually playing most of the time, in a ship fitted with a 1m isk mod. my issue isn't even that a single player is capable of doing all of this, its that there is no possible way to find and destroy said player, not even a mechanic that even the most incompetent player could easily evade as long as they were still present.in every other situation in eve you must be at the computer risking your own money in order to either make money or cost others money. the invulnerability of cloaking means that you are capable of costing others money (with the threat of attack) with absolutely no risk of your own and without having to even actually be at the keyboard"
5/20/2011,"i for one agree with t'raq mardon's proposal. because he's such a beacon of truthiness i hereby move we deal with the afk cloaking problem by completely removing the usefulness of doing so. how should we go about doing it? simple, remove local.t'raq mardon friend, i'm with you in this fight against local!"

5/20/2011,can't take it in 0.0? (free for all space / kos / nbsi / no concord rules )high security systems is that way ->off you go son
5/20/2011,1
5/20/2011,"i have no problem with ""free for all space / kos / nbsi / no concord rules""i have a problem with there being a way to become completely invulnerable and have full control of an engagement by simply fitting a cloaking device. there is a counter to every other ship and mod in the game, its time cloaking devices have a way to be countered as well"
5/20/2011,"i'm going to help you this one time t'raq, but this one time only.there is in fact a possible way to find and destroy said player.you must devise a trap. a cunning trap, set with the sole intent of getting caught ratting, in a ship, that is capable of holding said player should he pounce. get some friends to lay in wait for the naive to come knocking on your hull, then, by the time he realized whats going on, its too late, the game is up.if he doesn't pounce, well, then you've spent the day ratting or mining, and no harm no foul.i'm concerned that a submariner like yourself has such a hard time understanding how to catch a hidden foe, but, perhaps you were in the french navy."
5/20/2011,this has to be a troll. nobody can be that stupid.
5/20/2011,"well as someone else proposed have alternate systems for your everyday stuff you do. if one system is not clear for your everyday business, simply go to another."
5/20/2011,"hey i'm going to petition you also. your actions don't allow me to play the game the way i want it to.what i want to do: i want to shoot you till you blow upyour action: you won't undock and you're afk. you're totally safe. how unfair is that.result: i can't do what i want. whaa whaa.same logic, isn't it?"
5/20/2011,"afk cloaking does nothing to stop you. it is your own paranoia and inability to plan ahead. you are ruining your enjoyment.therefore, there is no reason for this thread. please nuke it."
5/20/2011,all the glory to ...
5/20/2011,i grind standings for clients for isk. now i can't check client standings. this just killed my profession. great going.
5/20/2011,so have them give you a screenshot?
5/20/2011,because we are lazy and desire efficiency.i suggest making them available through the api.
5/20/2011,"please god yes. i've posted all this elsewhere, but this fraks up fw as well as other general empire-based roleplay stuff. without being socially accessible, standings are meaningless. i could roleplay an amarr hero with -10 empire standings...who'd know?"
5/20/2011,now how can i see what the standing say amarr has? how can i know what a corp's standings are until i join?why is creepy stalker even being nerfed?compromise... factions and corps only.
5/20/2011,i use standings to figure out which systems pve corps tend to be in for highsec wardecs. higher standings with certain npc groups = they run those missions.return my intel!!!!
5/20/2011,def
5/20/2011,"put it in a seperate tab in the standings tab (that is not selected by default), because lets face it, npc standings lagged the **** out of everything when you (accidently) checked them. (or truncate the list).but yeah i also want it back, it was a very useful intel tool to quickly check if someone is an alt or not (which is handy, especially for those who operate nrds)."
5/20/2011,here is the good solution.
5/20/2011,i use the npc corp standings to give out medals to my pilots. can't do it anymore. killing rp as we speak....
5/20/2011,"just give people the option as to whether they'd like to display the information or not.gj though, removing a harmless tool from eve."
5/20/2011,"i find it very strange that nobody has asked the obvious question: why did they remove the standings in the first place? was it for a good reason? if so, then the op should have to address why the reason for removal was ill-founded.perhaps this *was* the reason it was removed?"
5/20/2011,locator agents.
5/20/2011,i need to know how a potential member will effect my corp's gallente standings.
5/20/2011,"it is already not selected by default. default is whatever tab you left it when you looked up someone's info last time. some people depend on this mechanic to quickly look up the information they want on numerous people. it should stay, and you need to get smarter."
5/20/2011,they tried just making 0.0 bigger. it didn't work.
5/20/2011,it would indeed solve most issues - in the short term.wouldn't last more than a year though before the cancer that is the vast blue sea would consume all the new areas and we'd be back where we started only more obese.adding **** to a pile of **** does not make **** any more palpable. burn it and start afresh.
5/20/2011,why not just make 0.0 much smaller?why not just make lowsec much bigger?why not make highsec just 4 systems?
5/20/2011,"not supported. fountain is already goon suburbs. it doesn't need to turn into goon detroit.supported. more thunderdome!supported. jita, dodixie, and maybe 2 noob raining systems. that's all we need."
5/20/2011,"i think we should leave the cloaking device (and all the ships that use it) alone. instead i propose creating a new module that can be fit into a high slot, which i would call the cloak disruption generator. this would just be an iteration on the current cloaking system as scientists continue their hard work and research into new tools for us pod pilots to kill each other with.the cloak disruption generator would work much like a cyno gen: activating it would cripple the activating ship the same way (no movement, cloaking, jumping, etc.), but would cost strontium to run each cycle. it would show up on the overview like a cyno beacon as a cloak disruption field, which could be warped to by anyone in system.the cloak disruption generator would have a 10 minute cycle time, but it would not have any effect on cloaked ships until the very end of its cycle, at which point all cloaked ships in the system would have their cloaking devices simply deactivated (they could then be reactivated normally). the one exception to this would be any ship in warp when the cdg cycle ends would not be affected (minor buff for covert ops cloaks)."
5/20/2011,"the only thing i would add to your suggestion is a mechanic that doesn't disrupt active cloakers. active cloakers shouldn't be penalized. other than that, i agree.edit: i like your idea. but just to add. make it so an active cloaker can counter in some way the disruption, either by warping or some other mechanic. if the cloaker is not at the keyboard to counter the cloak disruption then he suffers the consequences."
5/20/2011,how exactly do you know the cloaker is active or not?
5/20/2011,"if a disruption signal goes up system-wide, and let's say it takes 30 minutes before it activates, the cloaker has 30 minutes to see and react to this signal. if he doesn't i think it's safe to assume he's either afk or not paying attention. in either case, he's game to die, as it should be in 0.0."
5/20/2011,i have been very irritated lately with the sheer amount of crooks in places like jita/dodixie. and have come up with a proposal to reduce the amount of these scammers.1. do not allow any trial accounts to talk in local2. limit the amount of text players that are under 2 months old can send in local in hubs.any other suggestions or support along these lines please feel free to post below.
5/20/2011,"upvote for not going frothing-at-the-mouth rage-induced overboard, but probally not a good idea. i doubt ccp wishes to risk alienating real new players, and a text limit would probally only serve to bring in even more scam accounts to make up the difference, hard to say."
5/20/2011,im all for limiting scam/spam perhaps instead of limits ccp could enforce temporary blocks on complaints perhaps even team up with 3rd party peeps that are already trying to spearhead this movement? ie:
5/20/2011,ccp needs to stop dancing around the issue and embrace trade hubs. put a fee to talk in local or loiter outside a station.
5/20/2011,"do that, and the hubs will move.not supported, don't punish newbies."
5/20/2011,"hi guys.i had to refresh my memory on what a trial can/can't do before posting here, and here is a link for anyone else that wishes to do the same:"
5/20/2011,scams are as much a part of eve as ratting and pvp.
5/20/2011,i'm sure there is a thread discussing that too somewhere.
5/20/2011,not supported
5/20/2011,"haahaha danika, you really are the definition of 'the status quo' aren't you? but i love you for it. i support any ideas for limiting scammers, as they clog up local, but i really cannot support a proposal to ban trial accounts from it. for all the reasons that others have already mentioned."
5/20/2011,"i've seen articles about eve scams in the bbc news. money cannot buy that kind of publicity. literally, you can't buy an advert on the bbc. hell, the reason i started playing was because of one of those articles. why ditch a great form of advertising?"
5/20/2011,"far be it for me to argue the merits of free publicity (i am a student of free capitalism after all) but if you want to go down that path of reasoning, i would put forth the notion that even if removed, the notoriety of eve+scams will live on forever, people will find new ways to scam that don't involve spamming local to the point of making it useless for actual chats, and finally i'm going to hazard a guess that not that many people join eve because they want to take part in scams. :)ps, i really didn't mean anything personal by the remark, please don't take it that way. it's just that you always seem to argue that things are fine the way they are."
5/20/2011,scamming and backstabbing is part of the game.learn to play eve...or learn to read.either works.
5/20/2011,disable linking in local period. make people work to be scammed.
5/20/2011,"cyno jammer can solve most of your problem now. cyno spool-up will solve more of your your problem later. all that's left is those pesky black ops ships, but watching local will work around that problem.the folks suggesting that ""cyno lighters are vulnerable"" don't get the point that the cyno is available immediately, losing the cyno lighting ship fourty seconds into the operation doesn't actually hurt. when the target is properly chosen, the ship lighting the cyno can be tanked and repped (as already mentioned).there does not need to be any special mechanism introduced into the game to make cloaked ships vulnerable. learn to face your fear, form fleets, own your space. my opinion is that existing mechanisms do need to be tweaked though."
5/20/2011,but it doesn't solve the problem of the cloaked ship being completely invulnerable with absolutely no input from the player. no matter how big the fleet that is formed is the cloaked ship is only vulnerable if he chooses to be. that's the same as me being able to sit in my carrier ratting with reds in system and them not being able to shoot me because of a special invincibility button. they want to kill me but can't because there is no way for them to.
5/20/2011,"no actually i like the status quo. i like the fact that afk cloaking, injects uncertainty into the mix. but it still relies upon you for it to work, hence why it's called psychological warfare.but i see the reason afk cloaking happens but you don't want too. not only that, you want even more power on top of the already powerful intel tool called local. i don't think that's a good idea."
5/20/2011,"there is no uncertaity here, everyone is certain that a neut is in the system and noone will bet his expensive ratting ship on the slight chance that guy might be afk.its harrasment/griefing pure and simple, but my problem is not with the harrasment/griefing, the problem is that while doing so afk cloacker doesn't risk anything.moreover, one man can do it over many systems without playing at all. if you want to disrupt gameplay of many people, at least have a decency to invest your gametime to do so.as for reason for afk cloaking, it is the same as the answer to a question ""why do cats/dogs leak their balls?""""because they can""being more specific, why to risk ships, waste time on looking for targets, when you can spread afk recons in a constellation or two and, when you ready, strike wherever you want? its just easier way to have fun with minimal investment of gametime and with current game mechanics you don't risk anything(as a recon pilot).so the risk/reward is very high... too high i'd say."
5/20/2011,"obviously this means that docking up, hiding in poses and logging out all need to be nerfed. when a gang of twenty reds rolls into system and everyone else docks up, hides in their poses or logs off, there is no way to kill any of them! (please don't try to claim otherwise, how long do you think it would take to kill even an unstronted large pos with twenty cruisers? i know you've never been to nullsec and all, but try and use your brain for once)"
5/20/2011,"danika and jack out both make valid and good points. but they are not mutually exclusive. i say give them the pos de-cloak pulse. sure if you want to all dock up to avoid it fine but as it costs them isk to use it, it will be a game of cat and mouse of when to use use it. and is an isk sink so it's good for the economy.plus, it will give the cloakers something to ""worry"" about. it should make them *think* more about strategy instead of being indefinitely invulnerable."
5/20/2011,"i do not agree,as already said this is our counter to local,the solution is remove local, but i am not hardcore enough to support that either, it would actually slow down a lot of the usual gameplay we engage in (i,e roaming) and push give more of the advantage to the big blob gang (though conversely it would be a nerf on their cyno removing on of it's most distinct advantages)just like a lot of people shouting out ideas they fail to realise actually a lot more experienced players have thought about this... a lot.. and this is not something that can just be changed, in fact it may have to stay that way whether you like it or not"
5/20/2011,"not to mention how horrific that would be to have your manticore fleet decloacked by some decloaking super weapon, lol actually this is such a stupid suggestion i am not sure why i have posted here"
5/20/2011,"if you want to kill someone inside a pos why dont you bring dreads? the whole point of the pos was to allow those who own the pos to force their aggressors to work harder to kill them. it was literally created to make it so that those living in a system would have a way to survive small roaming fleets while still giving aggressors the ability to get them by laying siege to the pos. the point of cloaking on the other hand was never to allow players to passively harass other players. harassment is encouraged in eve, afkness is not."
5/20/2011,"way to try to make it look like an extreme measure that would completely iliminate the use of cloaks. the suggestion would not limit the ability of a manticore fleet at all, the players would simply have to turn their cloaks back on and would be vulnerable for 15 seconds. further, they would have to be in a bomber gang set up in someone elses space meaning they should have something to worry about other than whether they are aligned to the target well enough"
5/20/2011,"a) because it's a 20 man roam, and if you try and do anything at all with 20 dreads, someone will drop supers on you.b) because even if you do hit the pos, you have to come back tomorrow to actually kill it, though i suppose having never been in nullsec, you don't know what reinforcement timers are.c) hiding in a properly set up pos makes you 100% invulnerable from any roaming gang, much like a cloak does. i thought you were against anyone ever being 100% invulnerable?cloaking devices were designed to allow a ship to hide, yes? well, what are they doing that is against their design? an afk player is not doing anything to you, your own fear is harassing you."
5/20/2011,"in my experience people who summarily state a suggestion is stupid usually are guilty of not think through the all the factors themselves :)why would it be so horrible? is your entire manticore fleet afk?anyways that's a moot point, because if you read my earlier post i was agreeing in so far as the pulse would just make the cloakers detectable via probing for a time period. do you think that would be too nerfing? i suppose you would if you like flying into an enemy held system and cloak logoff a lot."
5/20/2011,"so it is possible to destroy a pos then? it may be inconvenient to do it with roaming ships(you can take a large death star down with cruiser, you just need a lot of them and a lot of time) but using the correct ships a pos can be relatively easy to destroy right?how about a cloaked ship? is there any way to destroy it once its in the system? any special type of ship that can be used to find it? any possible way to counter it?"
5/20/2011,"can the op agree to amend this original proposal from de-cloaking the cloakers in the system to my suggestion of just making them probe-able, with scaling difficulty level, for a limited time, as to dissuade this discussion from going down any further dead ends and moot arguments?"
5/20/2011,"if by relatively easy you mean 'spend eight hours shooting the pos, hope the guns aren't loaded, hope the locals don't form up, then come back and do the same tomorrow, then yeah, sure, easy.you can: bait it, ignore it, shoot it once it goes active, ignore it, pay no attention to it, pretend it isn't there, assume the guy is afk until you get something on dscan, not be an idiot, grow a spine and/or stop pretending you ever once set foot in nullsec?"
5/20/2011,"though not exactly very clear in stating his points, i think t'raq means that it may be hard to counter a pos, but at least you can get tangible feedback while countering a pos. its a chore yes, but something you can make progress on. no matter how you try to bait or goad an afk cloaker, you really never know its working, especially if the cloaker just on vacation. so where it would cost a lot of isk for you to build a pos to 'deny' strategic space to enemy ratters, you can achieve the same by putting a cloaker 23/7 an a fraction of the cost. anyway, i think that is his arguement."
5/20/2011,"i'm glad you can admit you were wrong about a pos being 100% invulnerable. as for what you can do to a cloaked ship; there is nothing that you can do except try to get the player to de-cloak his ship. while the ship is cloaked it is 100% invulnerable.i think thats an awesome thought. would avoid actually de-cloaking any active players by only making them scannable (it should require maxed skills to have any real chance of scanning them down). there would need to be some limiting factor on the pos mod though to stop it from being run constantly like you said. not sure if this would be something easily programmed though.also, the people who continue to disagree with the idea of nerfing afk cloakers do so because they are afk cloakers and don't want to have to stop trolling these threads and actually pay attention to the game. no amount of sound logic will ever stop them from flaming you, they are simply lazy and don't want to have to earn their kills"
5/20/2011,"well, i don't want to take too much credit for it. it was jack oat's proposal after all, i just added a bit to it in the 2011.05.19 02:50:00 post, as i thought his original proposal would really irritate non-afk cloakers who happen to be in the system, and looking at the starmap or something. in general, i'm in the camp that cloakers should feel 99% safe while cloaked. but when cloaked in enemy (sovereign) territory, then they should feel about ~75% safe. i wouldn't go that far to make that assumption. some people in the thread are just skeptical of random new ideas, especially ones that are not articulated properly. there are just too many impractical and ill-concieved proposals that really the onus is on the op to make a convincing case. so the sentiment is generally ""guilty until proven innocent"" unfortunately.oh, and be easy on danika, she actually is pretty knowledgeable in the game mechanics. (at least in my limited experience), more than a few times she has pointed out flaws in my proposals that i didn't consider."
5/20/2011,"bawwwwwwww.cyno jam your system, keep a defense fleet up.your the one that wanted to move out to dangerous 0.0 space remember, suck it up."
5/20/2011,"as long as it affects afk cloaking only and leaves cloaking itself legitimate, i'm on board."
5/20/2011,"there are renters in alliance 0.0 who may not have the funds to defend properly. though regardless of that, a ~30mil tactic that requires a >>>30mil defense (cyno jam) is clearly a play imbalance. many wars are won by ensuring that your enemies are burning more isk than they are earning, with the victor being the one who has enough isk to keep the fight going. in such a war, a 30mil tactic that makes the enemy waste ($$$)* isk to defend is a strategic win, even if the cloaker never hot drops anyone into the system.* i'm not sure how much it is in terms of time and isk to set one of these up, but i'm guessing its significantly more than the cost of a cover ops ship."
5/20/2011,"well it seems that their attempt to subvert local as an instant intel tool, is working rather well on you.they are, just not how you like it.and people afk cloak, because of local.which would be pointless, without local.yea local intel power is very high and at least people can use afk cloaking, to reduce it's power somewhat."
5/20/2011,"just fyi, im taking the time to create as many cov ops alts as possible across my 6 accounts just to further prove how ******ed you are.i'm going to watch you do nothing, and theres nothing you can do about it.have a nice day.oh, and stop posting the same topic over and over again on new alts, you're just making yourself look silly."
5/20/2011,pathetic...
5/20/2011,"as the game increases in complexity and the abilities of the csm to affect change increase the needs of the people making and/or influencing decisions become more advanced. currently the method used in assembly hall or any of the other areas are to put forward an idea, describe what it would cause and why it would cause that, and what the advantages are. my belief is that eve has hit a size and level of complexity now that what is needed more than ideas for fixing things are ""white papers"" describing the nature of the problem or the nature of a part of a system as thoroughly and objectively as possible. the objectivity is of course one of the most difficult goals, but the search for the fundamental nature of a problem/system instead of a search for a justification for a solution helps in that. potential solutions could be included but the goal of a white paper is not giving the solutions as much as facilitating someone else's decision making. one significant advantage of a white paper is that it cuts through the noise. when you have a thread about a rather controversial change in game (like...i dunno...jump bridge changes) you get a 60 page megathread that has a blend of rather good commentary about potential effects (or the current nature of the system that predicated the need for said change) blended with a massive amount of trolling, whining, and generally worthless usage of time/effort/life. a white paper can be used as a way to remove the kugu and leave the good stuff, and beyond that it can come *before* the change, as opposed to after it. another reason i think we need to start formally adopting this methodology is based in my own bias as a scientist/engineer. when i need to solve a problem i minimilize, isolate, dissect, and model. i may toss out ideas here and there but in my business anyone who puts money behind a solution without thoroughly modelling the problem first will be out of a job quickly. thoroughly modeling a system can actually make the solution trivial. hence my desire for something equivalent here, aka a white paper.now of course, a call for white papers is easy. how do you manage that? that's hard. it takes nothing for someone to scrub together 15 minutes of crap, typing it up, throwing in some verbose verbiage and calling it a white paper (i mean look at this crap i just wrote.) the need for objectivity and thoroughness is such that we couldn't allow people to just slap something together and say it's research. frankly you need an approving body, the same way you have with any academic literature.so, here are a couple of offthecuff thoughts1) the csm could explicitly ask for certain topics to be covered.2) with those topics, people could submit white papers to a csm selected commission (or simply from the csm) for them to review for acceptance. they could be published directly here for discussion, but full approval would need to come from the deciding group to achieve a [white paper] status, if you will.3) the csm could commission a white paper from a committee selected by them which then could be approved/disapproved by some group (csm or csm selected commission).4) a financial incentive could be added for a thorough and high quality white paper. 5) maybe someone at ccp could be involved in accept/denying them.obviously there are concerns about conflicts of interest here. a dominant csm viewpoint could work to create/approve distorted white papers to support their platform. i honestly believe that for stuff like this, if it is well done, will be appreciated for what it is regardless of the viewpoints of the csm, i honestly think that if the mitanni was presented w/ a white paper completely challenging his current viewpoint that he would be willing to read it before dismissing it. this is probably not enough for most people.maybe i am way off on all of this though. i just think that we have reached a point where we need models, not solutions."
5/20/2011,"title. says. it. all.if you can come up with a completely legitamate reason as to why covert op cloaks should be nerfed, i'd love to hear it.do not want to see your repeated crap about ""tearstears, my bot won't function properly, moretearshere"".mkaaaay?"

5/20/2011,not supported.i enjoy seeing the cloak threads and drinking in the tears that fill them.
5/20/2011,damn i didn't think about that...... where's the remove thumb button.
5/20/2011,"dunno where you play at but near us bots go spot when neut enters local , why cloak would help at all catching them"
5/20/2011,these changes make the use of covert ops cloaks for sitting afk in local useless. for everything else there is no change. unless you are saying that covert ops cloaks are for sitting afk 23.5/7 then there is no issue with them.the compromise is to hopefully satisfy those who complain about afk cloaking and those who use cloaks in pvp.
5/20/2011,local isn't going to disappear from k-space any time soon. part of the reason why not everyone lives in whs is the added security local brings. cloaking is really fine as it is. all this will do is make it harder for people to use afk cloaking and actually participate in hostile action instead rather than be afk.this can mean i'm going to be a badass politician or this is really a terrible idea. i'm guessing the latter. how so?
5/20/2011,"how do i gather intel in a cloaky ship when i am forced to decloak every 50 minutes to 3 hours?gathering intel means i'm sitting near some structure of importance (gate, station, pos, etc) watching. just watching. not moving, not constantly frobbing my cloak. just sitting there with the cloak on, watching ships come and go for hours on end.also, how do i reactivate the cloak when the capacitor is empty?"
5/20/2011,the op wants you to warp around system (with what capacitor?) until it recharges (by wasting capacitor warping?).all i have to say is: no.
5/20/2011,"it is you that wants change, so it is you that has to justify why that change is needed.you have spammed these forums with 7 or 8 threads about afk cloaking. oh i think it's you that wants change your way, but you've yet to prove your point.the fact that you call us trolls, indicates you have no argument. the fact that you cannot see a way of circumventing this idea with a macro, means you've failed to understand the wider implications of such a change."
5/20/2011,"i believe i have proven my point over and over again, that's why there are now several other players starting to make proposals of their own."
5/20/2011,"cloaking works fine.if u want to get rid of those oh so scary afk cloakers just have ccp remove local, or make it so that cloaked ships don't show up on local anymore once the device has been activated.real security comes from scouts, combat probes and your directional scanner.local is just easymode for k-space sissies."
5/20/2011,"the point isn't that i want the cloaker to go away, its that he should have to be sitting at his computer actually playing the game.and how do scouts, combat probes and d-scan help with a cloaked ship? they dont, nothing does"
5/20/2011,"no you haven't, and now your just spamming topics under a new name."
5/20/2011,what are you smoking? why a cloak should have heavier penalties then 2 warpstabs?also cycle timer on covert cloak means you can't decloak at any time
5/20/2011,"eve as it is is allready giving me too little time to sleep,please do not introduce a change where i have to wake up every 20 minutes just to get some capacitor on the covert going."
5/20/2011,"don't worry. there are modules known as ""cap boosters"" which are apparently unknown to the op."
5/20/2011,"this is why your idea destroys cov ops cloaking for any purpose other than running away (and especially for intel gathering longer than 4 hours, which i have done on occasion at the computer btw).cloak till cap runs out. ship decloaks. can't recloak until you have 10% cap (definitely enough time for someone to determine your ship type, which could ruin whatever you were planning), then you get to cloak for 1 cycle, and repeat this for as long as you are willing to waste time because they already know what ship you have and can easily guess what you are up to.this is a bad idea. as with all ""nerf afk cloaking"" threads."
5/20/2011,belief isn't fact.alts posting proposals? you must be new to eve-o forums. welcome.
5/20/2011,"not with the cloaked ship itself no, but you will be able to see the real threat coming in. buzzards and anathemas by themselves are nothing to be worried about u know.."
5/20/2011,why not just have the capacitor very slowly run down when cloaked
5/20/2011,"works as intended, perfect defense, perfect detection.don't change what isn't broken."
5/20/2011,"give a good reason to eject your ship in dire situation. when the defeat is crushing and you succumbed to a greater foe, you want to retreat and keep as many pilots as possible.allow ships that got stuck in interdiction bubbles or large bubbles to eject the pod, shooting the pod out at sub-warp speed, 45 km away from the ship. you can escape and save your clone, enemy can re-capture your ship after battle as a war trophy.right now there is no incentive to ever abandon your ship in combat. with proposed changes piracy, ship capture and trophies may become an new feature for the gameplay. 'abandon your ship and you may spare your life, while we keep the rest'."
5/20/2011,"not supported. it's hard enough to get the pod without a bubble, why make it harder?"
5/20/2011,"sure, but once the abandon ship command is given there should be a delay (say ten seconds or so) and the whole ship should shut down until pod ejects.prevents people from squeezing the lemon by staying until the last sliver of hull while still getting pod out to safety.yes, that would mean fairly early ejects would be necessary if pod is to live as no ship with inactive tank mods lives very long -> actual value to possible new ship acquisitions."
5/20/2011,and it's impossible to not get podded in a bubble.if there was a way to avoid being podded in 0.0 it would make possible to use other implants than just cheap ****. and that would result into: it would make podding worth something.i like the idea... maybe you could only emergency eject if you're above 50% structure to give opponents chance to get your ship(in return you get to keep implants = win win)
5/20/2011,"an interesting idea, sure you may not get the pod. but you get a free ship if you can fly it and you don't blow it up.if the guy is abandoning the ship then, i think if you can stop shooting it fast enough you should be able to take the abandon ship. which would be kind of cool to be able to capture ships, and not just blow them up."
5/20/2011,"supported. i don't want to shoot some pod, would rather have a free ship. eve mechanics should be about maturity and gain/loss, rather than some kind of emo teenager mentality where podding a clean clone is its own reward."
5/20/2011,"and how about when the guy ejects, and without his skills, the ship explodes from the damage it's already taken? no ship, no killmail, no nothing."
5/20/2011,"i think you csrs are worthless free loaders but get them to revert this quickly and maybe im wrong.only the faction standings matter.if they want to remove agent, corp and alliance standings thats fine.but right now there are 2 problems.1 we cant see what the npc corps standings are to one another.this is game breaking in many aspects.2 role players wear there standings like a badge of honor and roleplaying corps need to see the standing when they invite people."
5/20/2011,"no agent standings display - actually good, no real drawbacks.no corp standings display - meh, some good, some slightly more bad, somewhat tolerable overall though.no factions standings display - what the hell, ccp, are you insane ?proposal :* agent standings, good riddance* bring back faction standings, let them always be displayed* let the player select whether he wants the npc corp standings be displayed for himself or not, default should be not displayed* when any standings are displayed, they should be in a default collapsed expandable folder (like the one listing agents in a division) and only loaded when expanded"
5/20/2011,"also: it, like the ship fading to opaque, is not instant. once you decloak, it takes it's sweet time to play the sound, and even then the sound is soft and can easily be missed.i'm looking for a more ""jerking"" sound such as the audio alerts for ship health. something that actually gets your attention. =)"
5/20/2011,would a notification similar to a combat log be feasible? a simple short lived (a couple seconds like combat logs are) pop up saying you were de-cloaked because you ran into a corpse or whatever. something along those lines?
5/20/2011,as long as it's instant and adequately gets your attention.i would prioritize is like such: visual effect from ship > audio alert > text notification > what currently happens.
5/20/2011,supported.
5/20/2011,"interesting. i get the audio alert, but why do you prioritize a visual effect so high? don't you usually have the solar system map up for scanning while in a cloaked ship? and if you were close enough to see the visual effect (isn't there already one, the ship disappearing) wouldn't you be able to hear the audible effect that is already in place change when you decloak?"
5/20/2011,"if you think that was my suggestion, then please start your own thread. :)my proposal is to tax cross sec status transfers, which hardly would 'split' the market as alarmists would say. the economy is analog. not digital. you will have grey areas in-between. none of the other changes you listed are part of the proposal. someone else may have suggested them, but i never approved them as part of this bill. it was an interesting discussion of views, and from that standpoint i am grateful for all of you for participating. my proposal stands as is, but i recognize that it's not high pri, it just gimps any chance of adding more features to the economy. i'm sure this will be revisited once incarna features come out like black market smuggling of boosters etc. believe me those of you who have a knee--jerk negative reaction against any new addition of structure will eventually see that although many blind suggestions for regulation in this forum are best solved in other ways, sometimes the odd few which address an actual low level game mechanic flaw are needed in order for the game to grow. but as there are not many immediate gains that can be realized from this proposal, ( except for severly limiting hulkageddeon turnout ) and this thread has become a battle between the hard line conservatives vs the progressives, i'm going to take a wait and see approach to this. ( and have low hopes. :(. the bounty system fix was proposed 2008 and it still hasn't made it in. it's kinda depressing. )"
5/20/2011,"the bounty system is actually broken.i'm uncertain how you believe penalizing cross sec isk transfers would have virtually any affect on hulkageddon. or anything really for that matter, the most it could amount to would be a fairly easily bypassable annoyance, and intentionally designing a game to annoy its players...lowsec is intended for piracy. what is the core difference between lowsec and highsec? concord. killing each other there is intended. so what is the reasoning behind creating a section of space(lowsec), for the express purpose of letting people victimize each other(piracy), then attempting to penalize them for doing what you intended in the first place?i do find it a bit silly how cost effective suiciding miners can be, but when you go about addressing an issue it's usually best to do so in the most direct as specific way possible. so what you do really think is an issue? that piracy can be funded with 'clean' isk? seeing as how the piracy in question is an intended game mechanic, and something ccp wants to be there, nerfing it would be a bit counter productive. i'd suggest you try and think of a more suitable source of income for piracy instead then, because piracy was meant to be a part of the game.personally i don't care where pirates get their supply from, i'll probally stick to industry and general carebeary income regardless. or if pirates had a preferrable source of income i'd probally go use it to fund my carebeary activities, oh the irony. but as it is, there's no decent way to make isk in lowsec that isn't almost completely reliant on highsec, so i don't know why you blame them.as for the notion that nerfing piracy could possibly help lowsec... there's almost no other reason to be there, its the purpose of its existence."
5/20/2011,"rented, thank you for a reasonable response. just so that we are on the same page (as it seems from your reply you may be misunderstanding some of my points) -i have always argued that piracy is legitamate. don't mistake my stance on this with some others on the thread.-yes, the bounty system is broken, which was my point in stating so. the proposed fix was documented in 2008, and ccp has never gotten around to implementing said fix.-we both agree that piracy (or criminal professions) are currently gimped and needs to be its own self-sustaining career. where we disagree is how to fix the problem. the simplistic approach that you seem to be a proponent of is to give direct incentive to the pirates to move to low sec. we see these kind of 'direct' incentive attempts at fixing economic problems all the time (directed taxes, tax benefits, universal health care) the problem is that this won't work. (or if it does, it will have unexpected side effects.) how do you incentivize piracy in low sec? you need to entice indies to go there to farm so that they can be hunted by pirates ('legitimately'). but how do you do that when they make a good enough living in high sec? indies only move to where markets exist. which means you need buyers in the market for products, which means you need missioners in low sec, which means you need to make mission bounties more lucrative perhaps. all fine and dandy. but ask yourself this, if all the above was done, would you move to lowsec if you were a ratter? if you knew that everyone has a criminal alt ready to jump you? (and given the lack of concord, and smaller sec penalties, its gonna happen a lot more) it's one thing for legitimate pirates scanning down your deadspace. but it's totally another to have a fellow missioner pay someone to jump you and split your loot. what can alleviate this trust gap? using sec status as a ""badge of trustworthiness"", a proxy for a good reputation. and dealing with pirates should reflect on your reputation. right now sec status is a joke because you can be the biggest mass murderer and have a 10 sec status if you pay your alts to do your handy work. if you have that proxy for good reputation established then people trust each other more and people will venture out more. any solution which can address this lack of trust of players ( currently because they metagame ) will fix the problem at it's root. it doesn't have to be my solution, so feel free to suggest others."
5/20/2011,"first of all ...hello to everybody, i found a thread on google regarding supersss and the desire of some pilots to get ccp to change or better nerf, reduce, destroy, penalize super capitals, as in the opinion of those pilots super carriers are just too powerful!!! well the thread was locked so i decided to pick it up here to see what the turn out of opinions would be.... the desire to add something of mine was strong enough to lay my thoughts down. super-carriers as ccp panel put it at fanfest 2011 are simply super...therefor superior...in every way, even in costs....hugely.... and have the ability of a ship that is far far superior to the vast majority of ships in the game. please i repeat...do remember that super caps are very very expensive, and the modules combined...faction...officer modules, in addition to hull, may cost even more than the ship itself. as someone mentioned in other threads on mother-ships, when you are flying a spaceship that is worth billions and billions of isks, you want to make sure you have some serious fire power in your hands and super ehp's of tank to make it out. also consider the skills and time required to train and fly a super cap in a proper maxed out way is extremely time consuming. forcing an entire fleet to work together to take down a super cap, is a positive aspect of in-game mechanics, that allows for huge fleets of pilots to work together and enjoy the game ( team work ). at the same time, it offers the super cap pilot a challange to see how far he can push it in facing an armada and make it out alive ( his skills combined to his ability to pilot the ship, fittings, implants and more ) pure strategy....eve at its best. in my opinion the balance of the super caps and other ships is perfect just the way it is, the pure awsome power of the super caps is matched by the costs and risks the pilot who flies the ship has if things go wrong or if he doesn't plan his strategy with all the available variants. nerf the supers and you will be removing a beautiful super ship that is a pleasure to see on the field and an incredible experience to use on the battlefield and a goal that many many pilots in eve aim for...becoming a super carrier pilot!!! a great sadisfaction trust me. and please remember.....many many pilots attack supers and titans with words and ideas to get them nerfed by ccp simply because they cannot afford them or have no intention to put in the months of hard work required to either build them or to mine and obtain the resources to construct those ships or get the iskies neccessary via long hours of mining to pay for one. merit to those who do or can ( even to those who use plex money....its their choice, and good for ccp who cashes in a lot more real money...allowing them to invest it in further development on eve ) please remember.....meritocracy is essential even in the eve universe. thank you to all.ps: thank you ccp for giving us such an awsome, beautiful and incredibly pleasant category of ships to fly, i am sure i speak for all super cap pilots."
5/20/2011,"you're right, they should remove fighter bombers and reverse the buffs that made them unbalancing. restore them to their original state."
5/20/2011,"ouch... that wot hurts to look at. please format to include spaces and paragraphs and stuff, then we can read it."
5/20/2011,currently internet spaceship pilots are all over my screen and a girls eye is always on a banner. i am suggesting having a option to have a plain text only fourm that players can use at work and on smaller devices easier than the current standard format. thanks.
5/20/2011,"you're having to load the system environment as you undock as well as the grid that you're undocking into. the only way to shorten it would be to have a faster computer, unless the server is being lagged out, in which the undock will take forever anyway due to waiting on the grid to load."
5/20/2011,"not if things are optimized server side / on the client.and anyway currently when you load space from nothing it's way quicker than loading space from a station, meaning there's really something strange on the code"
5/20/2011,"if this is boiling down to ""the game is too slow, fix it!"" thread, then i think they are already on it, i don't think lag is something that requires a csm proposal for the devs to know about. probably more fit as a discussion topic in the general discussion forum, as it doesn't really classify as a feature request for the game."
5/20/2011,"this is kind of like going up to a race track and saying to one of the mechanics, ""hey have you guys tried making your car go faster? i think you'd win a lot more races if your car was faster."""
5/20/2011,it would be nice to be able to add an item to an existing sell order without having to have a completely separate sell order if it is in the same station.
5/20/2011,"is it just because it would be convenient? or do you see an actual game imbalance with the current way that orders work?i think that would only serve to dilute the potency of the retail and the trade skills. not to mention you essentially jump the order queue by doing this, completely breaking the fifo system of the order book.**not supported.**for those unfamiliar with how exchanges work, your orders are filled first by price priority (highest bids go before lower bids) then by order entry time (if 2 orders are at the same price, the one that was entered first gets filled first)."
5/20/2011,"well the way it is now most people cancel the first order and make a new one, (more unnecessary database traffic to take down and put up an order than modify an old one), or they put up a second order and penny game themselves, (order clutter from what is basically the same person)if someone can spend enough effort to modify the quantity of a sell (or buy) order then they will probably also put in enough effort to penny game whoever is outbidding them.yeah this is a convenience thing. imagine you have a steady income of some material (mining, pi, a pos) sometimes you just have a hauler full of something and you just want to take it to a market hub and throw it in with a sell order you already have.also if you want to have a load of sell or buy orders open at once, all you need to do is make 2 more alts on the same account as your main. spend a week or so training up trade skills for sell orders. contract stuff to your alts, and have them put it on the market. then just let the alts sit. you don't need to pay for another account because your alts are sitting there on your account and you'll never have to log into more than one of them at a time. so with no added cost you can get 3 times the sell orders open than you normally would. and honestly who needs that many sell orders anyway?"
5/20/2011,ops of said threads should be given a 30 day ban from game.that is all.
5/20/2011,support
5/20/2011,"not supported. i personally find it useful to afk cloak in systems (surprised?) but i'm doing so in low sec/high sec where there is no sovereignty. i think cloaking should not cost you anything or be on any timer. however, as you may have read in other threads on this topic, i do recognize the unbalance in gameplay when this is used to squat in someone else's doorstep. so the natural solution when this happens to you is to pay somebody to remove them where they are not wanted, but it should cost you isk to do so. so the only viable solution was jack oats one where a pos (thereby only works on sovereign systems) has an upgrade that will make cloakers 'findable' for a short time, thereby giving the owners of the house an opportunity to evict the vagrant if they stay too long."
5/20/2011,can we have a search field in the lp store? with the current filters the options are way too limited...
5/20/2011,2
5/20/2011,"if ccp plans to boost 0.0 industry and/or nerf high sec industry so we dont depend on jita for everything in 0.0 then this change makes perfect sense.if you just keep nefring 0.0 people will simply go to empire, run missions there (or other isk making activites) and clone jump back to 0.0 to have some fun. to some people this makes perfect sense it just eludes me."
5/20/2011,my bad i will add more when i post.

5/20/2011,"day 2 - ""dreaming of quality assurance"""
5/20/2011,"thanks for posting these up, good stuff (even though i do wish they could be more detailed....but i understand nda's)."
5/20/2011,this is a really good point. more npc null = more small nullsec alliances.
5/20/2011,have you guys seen the new eve quarterly economic report?
5/20/2011,"right off the bat the biggest faucet is pirate bounties. they will have to go, but killing pirates still needs a reward, otherwise people will just straight up leave nullsec.one solution might be the rouge drone solution. just have them drop minerals, or better yet, t2 building materials. this might create a kind of ""material inflation"" where the market is flooded with materials.this might not be so bad as more materials would encourage more ship construction. and more ship construction would encourage people taking more advanced ships (which are now cheaper) along on roams and ctas. more ships in space means more of them getting blown up which makes it's own material sink.you could also go the incursion route and hand out lp. loyalty points are basically inflation proof since they can't be given to other players and can only be turned in at certain npc stores for items. lp is basically a module, or ammo, or something, waiting to happen."
5/20/2011,"there is so much wrong with what both of you said that i'm just going to focus on the obvious points:1. if you eliminate bounty prizes, the remaining isk faucets do not equal the existing sinks.2. the depicted sinks do not include the largest one, which is the difference between insurance and actual fitted ship cost. pvp combat losses are an isk sink, but one which is harder to depict in a graph. not all the mods survive and insurance doesn't cover the full cost.3. prices on tech 1 items are generally stable or declining over the last year despite ccp eliminating the tritanium floor several years ago. if you look at the mineral price index on page 23 you can see that mineral prices are declining in more months then they are climbing. tech 2 prices are climbing because pi drives up pos operation costs. the past year trends suggest that the game did go from a period of gradual deflation to stabilization to gradual inflation, but nothing which suggests that anything is seriously out of whack.deal wiz it."
5/20/2011,"uh, no. ship destruction is an isk faucet, and mod destruction is isk-neutral. when you buy a ship and mods from the market, money is transferred from you to the sellers (less transaction taxes). when your ship then explodes, you get an insurance payout. the net result is that the amount of isk in the game has increased - the guys you bought the ship from still have the isk you gave them, but now you have the insurance payout in your wallet as well. you individually are worse off, but the amount of isk in the game as a whole has gone up."
5/21/2011,"oy! will we get a preliminary report before release of the official minutes? forums need something to ***** and moan about and we are running dangerously low .. damn cloaking threads have started up again!!! - bff is everyone, null included.- cs is everyone, with a null bias (omg lag, to the petition mobile!)- ship balance is everyone, with a null bias, especially if they start work on capitals and ways to limit blobs.- ui improvements is everyone, null included.- eve marketing is very much null, the epic struggle against lag has been a selling point for many years .. no one wants to try a game that promises hours of boredom in a high-sec belt - npe is npe."
5/21/2011,yep
5/21/2011,"quoted for maximum trollage. i spent over 2 years flying nothing but caldari ships and using missiles. i didn't do a lot of pvp i'll grant, but when i did i was using hml's. i never used ham's, and nobody in any alliance or corp i flew with, would ever consider using them. in fact, they made a point of telling people not to use them. any pvp i did do, was strictly limited to roam's and small gang pvp, and did not benefit from maximum blobbage which completely removes any need for skill or sensible fitting. in fact, with the leadership bonuses stacked right, and the number of ships, you're pretty much guaranteed to have ever possible threat countered. no need to worry about velocity, sig, or any other factor. just click your modules and wait for all the pretty explosions.i wasn't aware that cruise missiles could reach 8km/s. pretty sure i've never seen anything top 5, (and a bit), km/s in any fitting. i never trained cruise to max though, and never used them much.i never said anything about dps or game breaking. i was talking about balance, and using a comparative tool. it's been days since i posted that honestly, and i've actually forgotten what point i was trying to make, or why it mattered. obviously you have too much time on your hands, and too little else to do with it. personally, i work for a living, and can't be bothered to fill my head up with all this kind of unrealistic nonsense about a fictional game. the math may be easy, but the details only serve one purpose, and that is limited to this little world. memorizing them is kind of like remembering all the spells in d&d. it has no real use or purpose."
5/21/2011,"and yet here you are complaining that they're broken. right. you're totally credible there.fyi a ham drake can push out about 600 consistant dps and has a perfectly workable pvp nich<U+FFFD>.caldari bs iv and missile projection iv is enough to have a raven spewing them out at 7.3km/s, without rigs or implants.yeah, it shows.here's an idea - if you don't know what you're talking about, and have basically just admitted it, shut up and stay out of game balance threads.also there's a big difference between knowing every tiny detail of a game, and knowing the fundamental basics of missiles. you clearly have neither."
5/21/2011,"as a former nullsec builder, here are my two cents:the worst thing about industry anywhere is the ui. i didn't stop building because it was cheaper/easier to jump stuff in from jita, i stopped because my fingers bleed when individually queueing up 10 identical invent jobs ad infinitum and ****ing with the pos interface.slots are an issue if using outposts; and were probably the largest obstacle to building (after carpal tunnel/boredom/misery with the ui). more outposts per system and/or more slots per outpost/more levels of upgrades would be good. i think if there are more outposts, the ability to destroy them becomes more important (i think that feature should be implemented regardless). or you could just fix poses and the corp management/security interface so that, for example, someone could install a job without being a ""factory manager"" having the ability to destroy everyone in the corporation's jobs without leaving a record of having done so. also modularity is key, because dragging and dropping stuff and having to be within 5k of the pos module is a real pain when you have like 8 labs and 3 chars running jobs -- make them add up to one giant lab module with all the slots and one giant hangar/bucket for all your stuff.i think dynamic pricing for empire slots is a no-brainer (if you want to queue up a build job in jita 4-4 where wait times are 30 days, that should cost more than an empty station in solitude). it might not push people to nullsec but it will definitely spread people around more. you could even provide a bonus to build time based on sec status to further encourage frontier industry. i think the base price of highsec manufacturing could increase by a factor of 100 and it wouldn't make much of a difference -- something like 100 isk an hour for a build slot is a rounding error. provide discounts for standing (i don't think there is one atm, right? it only affects refine tax...) and you provide further incentive for people to explore pve content (sigh, such as it is).someone suggested mineral size adjustment; sounds good to me. make trit much smaller and megacyte much bigger. mineral compression is kind of stupid and symptomatic of poorly-designed features, imo. make ore compression better, perhaps, and/or make 25% of minerals inherently unrecoverable upon reprocessing ammo/modules/ships. i think a tweak to the relative abundance and bonus level of the bonus ores is probably also in order -- instead of just +5% and +10% (which doesn't make much of a difference) make them +25% and +50% and greatly reduce their abundance in empire/correlate it to truesec. also maybe make mining not so boring/lame. golf and fishing require skill and attention - don't use the fact that people chat while they're bored as an excuse for boring content/gameplay.but really, first fix the ui."
5/21/2011,"no, 0.0 is about empire building, not camping and then going back to jita to buy more potato chips.build a fracking empire and get rid of the hi sec addiction."
5/21/2011,"supported. as long as it doesn't change the game mechanics, the effect seems not only cool, but consistent with most eve cutscenes."
5/21/2011,"in addition to my above suggestion, i thought the people at ccp may wish to hear about what dark shikari said when i asked him this question via email recently:me: are you not even tempted to pay new eden a visit?dark shikari: nah, better, more fun things to do. things that don't involve beta-testing ccp software and sitting in capital ship fleets for 8 hours without shooting anything.ak"

5/21/2011,"actually no, in stations you can camp the station and wait for them to come out. cloakers cannot be camped, so they can drop their cynos with more surprise than a station camper. anyway that's not your point though, which was that the op has poor justification for his proposal."

5/21/2011,i think they tried to make life easier for blob fleets and ended up screwing care bears and fw players.
5/21/2011,supporting this petition.
5/21/2011,how do i give this a thumbs up?
5/21/2011,except the hi sec population won't actually decrease. it will just chain crash the server and cause an exodus from the game.
5/21/2011,"yes, he would. this is actually a pretty good idea and would make mining more intuitive."
5/21/2011,"i know this has been brogth before by difrent players, but i want to share my idea how i think it could be done. most of you probably know all those discussions with all positive and negative responces and the questions why want and dont remap those skills. so i get strigth to the point.idea is:1) the skillpoint remap will be only avalible once for character lifetime.2) maximum to 10 (ten) skills can be remaped, so you have to choise carefully wich skill you do or do not remap.p.s. the number i have post is seems resonable since there is much more skills some would be glad to remap, though this is just an number i think is fair and ofc it will be to csm and ccp to make desigion what exact numbers will be taken if the idea will be pushed trough.discuss!"
5/21/2011,i support the general idea of a skillpoint remap.
5/21/2011,"my suggestion:1) no skillpoint remap avalible.2) maximum to 381 skills can be trained, so you have to choose wisely which skill you do or do not train."
5/21/2011,"i think it would be better to not give the option to have any skill remaps. reasons being it is totally unnecessary, since we don't have a skill cap, it promotes fotm chasing and diminishes the value of high specialisation and variation within the game.all of that applies to your particular variant, but some to a lesser degree. the problem is that your idea creates new issues. first being that you provide no reasoning for limiting it to once in a lifetime. you just want to get your foot in the door and do anything to get the mechanic implemented in some form at all costs. that isn't a good way to design game mechanics. you have to specify what it is that you're trying to fix or improve with your change, then we discuss the issue and finally the devs get to decide if it's a good fix or if the issue even needs fixing.your solution also creates new problems, since people will **** things up with remaps and it will cause a constant whine of request asking for additional remaps. that is a problem especially for you, since if you ignore their whines, we can ignore your proposal, because it basicly amounts to the same thing. so the only way to do this is to either not allow it at all, since it isn't necessary and is damaging in the eve skill system or just say ""**** it"" to all the objections and implement a system that allows periodic remaps.personally i'm firmly in the no remaps ever -camp, since it really isn't necessary with the eve skill system and has strong negatives attached to it, so i won't support skill remaps in any form."
5/21/2011,"good point! but sadly enough not everyone so wise as you are.1st) i want to point you out that some players did not have back in 2003-2004 all those shiny guides, evemons and any other career tutorials what you have now. they has to lern hard way.2nd) the things have been difrent before. eve has evolved to difrent angle, some professions become uterly useless so some of the skills simply wont be used by players never again, thats why i think it will be fair to give them just a small trade off."
5/21/2011,some of the point i have posted just above on the reply for another fellow pilot
5/21/2011,but wait. the people won't receive a guide 'which skills and where i should remap to win the game' with this remap. and they will make mistakes. so what's next? another 'once per life' remap?and the things will become different again six years from now. and some stuff (like t1 ships lol) will be useless. so what's next? another 'once per life' remap?
5/21/2011,"i cant agree, choices made should be choices worn."
5/21/2011,"if you're going to suggest something like this, make it functional on grid only. there is no way any device could affect ships system wide, and there is also no way you could scan down a cloaked vessel system wide. it's completely rediculous and overpowered. handicapping a vessel for 30 minutes is also rediculous, and just goes to show how little you are concerned about the cloaked vessels combat threat potential.any device that interacts with a cloaked vessel, (by disrupting the cloak or by allowing the ship to be detected by some means), should only function on grid or in a similar limited fashion. at any rate, any such device should be limited by the size of the vessel that activates it, as well as by the size of the cloaked vessel. meaning non-covert op's ships, especially cap's and larger have a greater chance to be detected/disrupted, and that chance is made higher when a cap or supercap, (even titan), is cycling the module intended to defeat them.any device intended to provide system wide disruption of cloaked vessels is completely unrealistic, but it is possible that multiple vessels could scan down a cloaked ship in a system, and that an additional module could help them do it. the idea here would be that this additional module sets up a 'disruptive' energy wave that affects any cloaked vessel within a certain distance of it. i would say 1-2 au at most. combined with combat scanner probes operated with precision, nearly any cloaked vessel could be scanned down provided it was in that 1-2 au area while the combat scanners ran a high intensity scan there. basically the module would up nearby cloaked vessels signature radius, (from zero) without decloaking them.another iteration on this idea, is to make that module the same one, that will disrupt cloaks on grid. operating the module would restrict movement or other action, (similar to a cyno or cloak), and may require fuel, depending on how it's implemented. cycle times would be short, allowing the vessel to change position, and actively search for cloaked vessels along with its fleet.i'll support anything well thought out, and well balanced. no matter what your cycle time, nothing short of a super-nova is going to disrupt any cloaking device within 100 au."
5/21/2011,"honestly, this simplest ""solution"" to the afk cloak ""problem"" (if it really is one) is to build probes that can find cloaked ships. have it take 15 minutes for them to perform a scan or some similarly ludicrous value.any active covops pilot can clearly see them on directional and simply has to warp to a different location safespot every now and again. (my god, the cloaker has to watch directional now? the horror!)whether or not this is necessary or even desired is up for debate, however."
5/21/2011,"i think the problem with this solution, is it makes it so any non-cov op's vessel, (including black op's), is now 100% detectable, and all you have to do is sit and wait for the cycle to end."
5/21/2011,"afk cloakers don't harm anyone, apart from botters who can't get their program to function as they'd like.only time an ""afk"" cloaker will ever harm you, is when that same ""afk"" cloaker isn't afk."
5/21/2011,"because uncloaking for 10 seconds to warp from one safespot to another is just too dangerous. right, moving on..."
5/21/2011,"that would make it impossible to detect afk cloakers, which is the whole point why not? scan probes can scan the whole system (and creating a new type of probe would be fine, this idea just makes finding cloakers bore expensive and dangerous.i proposed 10 minutes, just like a cyno, not 30 minutes. what does how much i'm concerned with their 'combat potential' have to do with eliminating afk cloaking? it doesn't matter what ship their in, if they are afk for 23 hours in a red system they should be killable. why? is there something unbalanced about announcing in system that you're looking for cloaked ships and if the cloaked ship doesn't warp between safes or recloak they will then be detectable? is there a situation where this will actually impede normal behaviour of 'active' cloakers?again, why this strange restriction? i honestly don't understand what your definition of 'realism' is that scanning probes, jump bridges, ihub detection arrays, and the new ship scanner that detects anomolies system wide can pass as realistic but this idea fails."
5/21/2011,i actually like this idea better than many of the others suggested
5/21/2011,"pathetic would be the so called ""hardcore"" players of null running and hiding when a neut enters system."
5/21/2011,"there are countless mentions of the solution to this is to remove local.although this is a valid solution to this i do not believe it is the same.that's the equivalent of fixing the problem that you have a enemy nuclear submarine lurking in your waters by ripping out your sonar system. you still have the submarine there, but it doesn't bother you anymore, until he decides to launch his missiles at you. there still exists the play balance issue that nobody in the game is able to find the sub, ever.so it basically boils down to a simple question to the devs, did they intend to make cloaking a perfect 100% safe way of lurking into enemy territory, or did they mean it for them to be possibly detectable, (but maybe through difficult means)? before you jump to the conclusion that if it is the former, then we should all just support the removal of cloakers from local, ask yourself the follow on questions that it raises: if you just remove the cloakers from local:-what happens if the cloaker just posts on local in order to achieve the same effect?if you remove local chat altogether:-easier said than done, i'm sure local chat is used far more for beginners to find others playing in the same system to chat. it's too big a part of the 'community' glue in eve to be removed, just because in this one small circumstance, it is being abused.i don't think removal of local is a viable alternative."
5/21/2011,"did they ban your ""t'raq mardon"" account? i mean, you keep throwing these submarine things up with all your alts and its giving you away."
5/21/2011,"funny, but no. hey, and *i* was the one to use the submarine reference first! edit: to pre-emp any unnecessary back and forth, it was here:uboats"
5/21/2011,"being a carebare i can confirm that it became harder to make money in null after latest patches especially when you can't undock because of afk cloakers, when you have to run havens on a drake, when you don't have enough time to warp out in case of a hotdrop and so on. the idea is that to be a cloaker in a null system is too easy, you know. you can kill an afk cloaker only if you know exectly where he is. it s that carebears can do nothing to protect theirselves from spies and potential hotdropers. and cloakers can open cynofield anytime they need. that's not fare :) such measures won't change life of cloakers in general, but will give carebares an opportunity to do something to protect theirselves."
5/21/2011,"while they are docked up/hiding, they make no isk."
5/21/2011,"hey that's a thought, afk cloaking can be used to battle botters.put one afk cloaker in every system used by bots, no more botting.might not even need to involve using a bot to run the cloak, just many clients and accounts."
5/21/2011,"actually ejecting does work to save yourself (body/implants). if you wait for ship to blow up it makes a lag or othr delay for enemy to lock and scram you (and pods can normally instawarp).eject, and in less then a second latter can insta warp out.but having a eject do a catapult would save you from bubbles. currently bubbles are the big bane of pods."
5/21/2011,sometimes it's almost as if people don't realize that ccp wants them to get popped and podded.
5/21/2011,"this change was short sighted in removing a valuable information tool that was rarely if ever 'abused' to stalk players and claims of db calls could have been more elegantly addressed. a simple expandable tab could have been implemented to only show standings when opened and thus the db call only happens when specifically selected. this could have further been streamlined to have various corps given their own tab to expand so that you'd see only the agents standings with specific corporations instead of them all at the top then all the agents at the bottom. without standings we lose one of the few 'reputation' aspects pilots have in their claims of who they are and what they've done.one thing that comes to mind is to know whether alleged 'new' pilots begging for isk or asking for help have done the tutorials. barring the ability to check their record and see if they've done the tutorial missions or any mission for anyone they are all cast in doubt. further new players asking for help as to where their home system is now go from being able to check their initial tutorial agent's location to the much longer explanation of 'how' they can find that barring having assets at that place. the short answer of 'todaki' now becomes check your assets, open your character sheet, check standings find your agents, etc and so on. simply put ccp didn't think this through and once again removed information and 'reduced' eve because they were trying to optimize things. noble effort, ham fisted implementation, if attempts were made for elegance without sacrificing information this would not be an issue."
5/21/2011,"corp standings are necessary for standing grinders who must monitor their client's standings that they are grinding. unlike faction standings for rp/fw purposes, lack of corp standings for standing grinders is profession-killing, not just taking away a bit of fun or convenience."

5/21/2011,"that's a good point. but i'm also talking about getting decloaked while trying to dodge stuff in space when you're actively trying to get a warp in on someone.i was thinking more like a flash of light that isn't only noticeable at close range, something abrupt and attention grabbing. you know how you can see a torp hitting something even when zoomed out? something like that (though obviously different). this would also have the tactical benefit of the guy you are hunting becoming aware of your screwup (although he also has the overview...)and on the point of the current effects/audio, they just aren't good enough at notifying you. your ship slowly fade in, as does the audio, and both after a short delay.upon further reflection, i would rank audio and visual about equal. i'm just wanting something that tells you that you have been decloaked, and nothing subtle or unnoticeable like the current effects."

5/21/2011,"this set of changes has several negative effects, especially for people who enter large numbers of r&d jobs.1. more clicks are now needed to enter each job. the 'accept quote' window was previously modal, when it didn't strictly need to be modal, but now it doesn't even gain focus when it pops up. previously:window openspress enternow:window opensclick somewhere on the window to gain focus*tabenter*or ctrl + tab^n / (ctrl + shift) + tab^n, which isn't much better.2.3. if you click on the 'accept quote' window (i.e. not on any of the buttons) to gain focus, and then hit enter, the window closes and the 'installing job' message pops up. the 'installing job' screen then hangs indefinitely, and has to be closed manually via esc (also, it's modal, so you can't do anything else until you've closed it). the job still installs ok when this happens, but it's very buggy behaviour.suggested fixesmake the 'accept quote' window gain focus when it pops up.have the 'accept quote' button selected by default.revert the behaviour of the 'cancel quote' button to how it previously worked, i.e. returning the user to the previous windowdare to dream - perhaps those 2 windows should be combined into one?"

5/21/2011,"i wasn't suggesting piracy itself should be somehow made to be more profitable, rather more along the lines that lowsec should actually be given a viable source of income of its own. as it is the only viable income sources in lowsec are l4 and l5 missions, and the lp which is the main benefit of these missions essentially requires direct trade to and from highsec, lowsec has little income of its own in this respect. rather then trying to discourage pirates from doing what is essentially the only way they can obtain income, provide a different way. personally i don't think its an issue in the first place, but really an average pirate has no option but to make their income somewhere else... which is probally highsec."
5/21/2011,"name one such loophole.u already named lvl 4s and 5s as a viable source of low sec income yet u say pirates have no option but to go to high sec why? because as it is now, u're too lazy to trade the lp items to an alt?"
5/21/2011,"i think we are coming close to agreement here now. we both want both pirates and civilians to move to low sec (as low sec is better for pirates because no concord and less sec penalty, etc etc) so that doing 'piraty' things is easier.but you say low sec has lower income.... so does that mean you think that all we need to do is to increase the income of l4 and l5 missions? sure! but once again, i illustrate to you the problem of taking this approach: i'm a missioner, or a miner, what do a care if the missions give me more isk, if i have to worry that *everyone* showing up in local, is a potential threat? basically everyone not-blue needs to be treated as a red, and we all know (reading the other afk cloaking threads, that one red is enough to scare off the herds back to highsec.the only way that i see this can ever change is you need a better trust system in the game. starting by making people trust sec status as a reflection of your play style (good guy, or bad guy)you argue that adding these laws will i don't think it has been shown anywhere that without charitable donations, pirates will starve of isk. perhaps they should just do more piraty stuff like shoot up people in 0.5 systems. or have them hold people for ransom (shameless plug for my ferrying of passengers proposal). or fix the bounty and mercenary system like the csms proposed back in 2008 here (funny enough, after reading this, i was suprised how much my hauling idea was similar.)anyway, just throwing more isk into low sec missions/rats is going to just have the effect of making it more like null sec, without all the game mechanic defenses you can put in nullsec. it will go something like this:-make missions pay more/put better ore (ignoring for now the negative economic effects that has on the value of 0.0 space)-missioners go there-pirates follow them using 'good' alts. tag along in there mining/ratting-pirates jump into bad alt, gategank them, send money to 'good' alt-repeatlowsec will be empty again in a week. (unless you rat/mine with defense fleet, in which case, why aren't you in 0.0 sec instead?)low sec needs to be the ""home"" of pirates, where they can make a fairly decent living doing piraty things. for that to happen, ratters and indies need to go there first, (because they also need to be able to make a steady better living than in highsec, though with a little more risk) both need to happen. for the ratters, the problem in trust. current sec status system is insufficient. fix it, and they will come."

5/21/2011,"i was thinking we could have some minor improvements to the contract format which will make it easier for both parties in the contracting process.firstly, i was hoping that ccp could allow us to put names on our contracts so when i'm putting up a contract up for ""t2 ratting drake"" or ""fleet maelstrom"" or just ""random firesale stuff"" instead of the default ""multiple items"". this should make it easier for people to find contracts they're looking for at a glance instead of having to open up each contract manually and checking the contents.furthermore, when contracting a fully fitted ship, could we have the contracts display the mods by high/med/low slow instead of the jumbled mess it is now?these shouldn't be hard to implement and won't change the gameplay much, just make it easier for the players to get things done!"

5/22/2011,"b'ops are slightly underpowered but this is a classic case of people demanding far too much. there are lots of things you can do to make them better but that doesn't mean you need to implement all of them.playing around with simple fits i am getting figures like 1050 dps and 92k ehp from redeemer, 875dps and 93k ehp from the sin (still suffers from :hybrids:), 1222 dps + 78k ehp from the widow and 1046dps + 65k ehp from the panther. bearing in mind that these are not brawling ships i would say they are doing ok actually.the main limiting factor in b'ops fleets is fuel. the first issue we've hit in every b'ops fleet i've been in is running out of fuel to portal a recon fleet to any decent range.second main limiting factor is jump range. the tiny jump range drastically restricts tactical game play when it comes to hiding your fleet and making use of all the nooks and crannies in eves real star map.the ships themselves are fine they just need a buff in their primary function. and jesus cov'ops cloak would seriously break b'ops in terms of low-sec balence."
5/22/2011,"well.. all we need to do is paint you green and give you a few warts here and there. you'd be perfect.i've used ham's, just not in pvp. i wasn't impressed. sig bloom a ship and you'll get consistent dps, else they're basically just a ~400 dps, at best, short range missile, good against bc and higher for improved dps. i found hml's more consistent, better ranged and effective at all levels, which is why i use them. ham's were nerfed some time ago, and they've been broken ever since, whether you admit it or not.using max. or near max skill to determine that something is effective and working properly is just stupid. skills take time to train, and not everybody has them that high. try using something besides missiles, and maybe you'll discover their weakness.shove your 1337 bs, and take a step back from the podium. this thread isn't even valid anymore."
5/22/2011,it's actually the only way to compare things.
5/22/2011,"@fon: you're partially correct. the other way is experience. if something doesn't perform well compared to something else, then it is obviously in need of improvement. that's my opinion anyway.just for reference. i dps graphed hml's and ham's with equival"
5/22/2011,"dunno what we are actually arguing with, but hams are pretty pointless in most common pvp anyway, since we've got those very convenient heavies. does losing like 80% of the range to gain 10% dps sound appealing in any way? in this case i'd say no. though, it might be a bit different for cruise missiles, huge range of which is just useless, while the dps is pathetic. and no, torps are not hams. hams still 'feel' like heavies, while torps and cruise missiles are something entirely different.what i'm saying is that judging by experience based on subpar skills is pretty pointless, too i wouldn't say that hams are broken. that's just hml drake being that good rather than anything else, really. well, maybe a little tweaks here and there are indeed needed, but those are not as crucial as fixing the damned drake is."
5/22/2011,"time for me to get flamed in here.i fly mostly caldari and up to hacs for gallente. i have great missile/gunnery skills. i am one of the few people that really like my blaster boats and this may have something to do with the ones i fly. i fly the harpy and moa and tend to get ignored over other ships in my fleet as people dont seem to find me a threat.the issue with blasters is range and tracking right? if hybrid platforms receives a bonus to webber range then much of this would be negated it seems. with a bonus to webber range you would be able to close in quicker before you take too much damage on the burn in.this wouldnt result in hybrid platforms being used as 'interceptors' as webbing an opponent allows them to align faster, meaning less time to point, and if you were in point range in the first place then you would have pointed them then webbed them anyway.t2 webber is -60% speed, a scrambler (which blaster boats would use as they work inside this range) will shut off mwd. this should bring some balance, yes?"
5/22/2011,i wanted to add that for tracking you can attempt to minimize radial by not just clicking orbit and a missclick wont necc result in unwebbed opponents due to the bonus.
5/22/2011,"while admirable in intent, your effort to strip out the effects of painters etc. does not reflect reality. the fact is that hams are a close-range weapon system designed to be used inside tackle range, and you need a web to keep your target tackled. so hams are almost always used with web support. the web makes hams apply full damage - more than hms - to virtually all non-abing cruisers.this is an example of the dangers of take eft numbers at face value, without understanding their application in-game.there's basically nothing wrong with hams or the ham drake. it compares very favourably with its close-range counterparts of armour-cane, armour-harb and armour-myrm. it's just that people don't really fly those armoured bcs any more..."
5/22/2011,"i'm aware of their application in game, and i believe i already pointed out that a single ship cannot fit everything. web, point, and painter on a drake doesn't leave much for shields. even just web and point doesn't. if you weren't crowd tanking, you'd recognize the flaw in that. not that a fully tanked drake can survive solo anyway.that's for a drake, which has a decent number of mid's, and doesn't cover all the ships that have to sacrifice shields almost entirely, just to fit a single point.it reflects reality, just not taking into account random variables that increase exponentially as you add more ships to the equation. right?you must take some time to learn scientific principle one of these days."
5/22/2011,"fly a brutix and you'll find the 'threat' they percieve is much greater. you may even get primaried. the reasons you don't: you're flying caldari, and you have to sacrifice shields to fit point, scram, and web. this means you're either an easy take down, or easy to get away from."
5/22/2011,"if you fly some brutix and you are primary it's not because you're a threat but an easy kill mail every one want to add to his collection. let me fix it 4u: ""you're flying caldari, and you don't have to sacrifice shields to fit point, scram, and web. this means you're shooting everything on your overview without many drawbacks like distance, transversal or for your target easy to get away from you."""
5/22/2011,"then you have no say here. hams are a pvp weapon, and i actually have used them as such.wrong, wrong, and wrong again. with faction ammo i deal full damage to a properly tackled cruiser, and with rage full damage to a battlecruiser. working as intended.nope, it's standard. but hey, it's not my fault your missile skill suck.it's perfectly valid, you're just wrong and have no clue what you're talking about.this would be horribly overpowered. seriously can you imagine every t1 blasterboat running round with web bonuses? there'd be no point flying anything else.i have scram and web on my drake, this is all i need to hit for full dps and oh look, i still have 80k ehp.so let's add the drake to the number of things you don't have a clue about judging by your utter ignorance of everything missile-related, ""scientific principle"" isn't doing you much good right now. i can examine figures just as well as you, but the difference is i can apply them to reality.umm, no, you get primaried because the brutix is a glass cannon wheras the drake is significantly tougher. their applied dps will often turn out to be pretty similar.now just for fun: things mars theran likes to make points on, but actually knows nothing about! - the drake- missiles (the basics) - hams - cruises- skill comparisons- brutixes- primary calling- basically anything outside his cute little carebear bubble :)"
5/22/2011,"you've stated that you have no experience with hams in pvp, so, no, you are not aware of their application in game. you do not fit a painter on a ham drake. mwd, web and point leaves three medslots free, enough for 83k ehp. have you fallen through a wormhole from 2007?i'm a scientist, i'm always learning."
5/22/2011,"why? it worked just fine for ~5 years...looking forward to seeing how this 'bigger picture' on balance works out, assuming csm can nudge ccp to make it happen."
5/22/2011,"when exactly did blasterboats have web range bonuses? that was what he was suggesting, and i stand by my point that thoraxes running round with 20km webs is not a good thing."
5/22/2011,"ah i misread that as web strength, nvm..."
5/22/2011,you homos still *****ing about the drake and heavy missles?simple fix!!!!reduce heavy missle/cruise flight time and intoroduce a mod (like tracking comps and te) but for missles lets call it accelerated launcher system or (als) it increases the velocity of missles and explosion velocity... have scripts for the mid slot version and you have now fixed the drake...thanks you !
5/22/2011,"flying a ship with all gank and no tank is asking to get primaried. thats just how it works. you can tank a brutix and take a 300 dps hit, ull still be hitting 600s."
5/22/2011,"wow, calm down. anyway your idea is ridiculous, if there was actually a need to nerf hml drakes (doubtful, really) it's accomplished much easier by slashing max lock range. there, same result without pointless missile nerfs."
5/22/2011,"i think part of the discussion on this thread that has been missing is price. i think that is a key factor to add to the equation when talking about ship balancing. the whole call to arms to nerf the dram seems overblown. that ship has not ruined the game and made all other frigs obsolete. it's still a frig and with proper tactics in a fleet we regularly get one shot alpha's on them much to their surprise. and it's 100m isk+ when you lose one. i don't fly one, but if a player wants to spend that kind of isk on a frig then power to him. it comes with great performance, well earned for the price. if you nerf it, then you better nerf the price too. i say, leave it alone and fight smarter and watch them cry to a well coordinated attack. to me this game is about fleet and cooperative play, and can overcome any solo ship even the very scary dram.i think that if players want to spend the isk on a shiny, then great. it should come with a corresponding increase in performance because it cost a bunch and that risk should be rewarded.this leads me to my second point to reinforce the gallente ship dilemma. if the overall concept of the gallente ship is a close in fighter then that comes with a host of issues that have been discussed. 1)it must get close and that requires a means to do so however, it is an armor tanked platform (normally) so difficult to accomplish this. more armor means lower speed (rigs) and less agility. i love the idea of up close and personal face melting, but you can't get there. fast ships just kite. even a good coordinated fleet action, where a scout gets you a close warp in, the targets move out of range before lock all too often, or even if locked can burn away even with web/scram on them. worst of all for gallente is that you must commit in the fight since your a close in fighter. this means high risk of being primary, tackled and getting popped. this makes the cost/risk ratio on these ships poor. much more cost effective to fly a hurricane or a drake and stay at some range, and you have the speed to gtfo when its time. so yes, gallente (aka spanish armada) needs a hard look and their corresponding weapons, but also price. reduce the mineral requirements or something to make gallente ships much less expensive and i think you'll see use go way up. if you want a whole race dedicated to close in killing, that risk has to be balanced with a lower cost relative to other platforms due to the much higher risk of being killed."
5/22/2011,if you understood the suggestion you would know that its not a ham nerf but a ham/torp boost...having a low slot mod that increases the expolsion velosity and velosity of missles is a good thing...reducing the range of heavy missles/cruise whilist giving them a mid or low slot to increase thier range/explosion velosity is a good thing...i would much rather have an overall missle boost while still having a heavy drake nerf... if you just reduce targeting range on the drake then you still need to boost other missle ships...imagine a torp raven that has a mid slot to increase explosion velocity... now that 1200 dps can actaully do some damage...making the cerb bonus mean something is a good thing...
5/22/2011,"maybe we could call this strange new medslot item a ""target painter""?"
5/22/2011,owned
5/22/2011,really there is a target painter for low slots?the tp increases missle velosity now?crazy
5/22/2011,"if 0.0 space is about empire building why not give the people who have sov on a system the ability to deploy some form of field defenses, like being able to set up defensive structures near fields, gates, and outposts. im not talking gate guns like the high sec ones, but lets give these people the ability to actually try to secure a system.also on a side note i think that hacking should get some love in null sec. like being able to hack a pos module and force it to go offline. or being able to hack other ships and potentially cause a random module on the target ship to go offline.make a covert hacking module so black ops ships can sneak up and do things like disable jump bridges and cut off supply lines. in terms of farms and fields how about this.a structure that allows some form of automated mining from a pos, i know that sounds like a bad idea but let me give an example.you create a new structure (remote mining drone array) you also create a new type of mining drone (think the mining drone equivalent of a fighter-bomber) and a new type of probe that can be fired from the probe launcher (mining beacon probe)so you anchor and online the remote array and fill it with these drones. you then send one of your ships out to tag an asteroid with one of the mining beacon probes. at that point your remote array can detect the beacons belonging to the same corp or alliance and someone with access can give the pos the command to send the mining drones to harvest that asteroid. small gangs looking to interfere could begin targeting these drones while they are in the field harvesting rock."
5/22/2011,"here here! to develop the marke[t], you need more haulers, more traders, and an exchange. there are so many things we need to improve in this interconnected weave of institutions for the economy to work. 1) a trustworthy credit rating agency 2) a functioning banking system. 3) a functioning bounty system, which would create more mercs and escorts as professions, and allow haulers to contract escorts for guard duty. 4) a futures exchange market, all commodity markets depend on it for connecting producers and suppliers, and most of all 5) a system for tracking reputation that isn't as flawed as the current sec status one, so that people can know who they can trust. (of course this does not preclude deceit)"
5/22/2011,"part of this is an issue of people.they say its not profitable to do production in 0.0 because there is not enough minerals out there to feed the demand.in reality its that there are not enough miners out in low sec, think about it this way,if you counted up all of the ore available for mining in every system in eve i am willing to bet that only 50% or less is actually in high sec empire space. but 90% or more of the miners are in high sec.so if you really want to get things going, these alliances need to recruit and protect large dedicated mining teams to work their fields.it would be nice if they could be able to place some defensive structures out in the fields to help protect the miners. if you actually had people defending the miners there would be no issue of not enough minerals available locally."
5/22/2011,you missed the part about mining being the single most boring facet of eve. so boring in fact that even legitimate miners have dabbled with botting and hugely inefficient afk mining using haulers.it is like saying that people in siberia need not freeze during winter because there are loads of trees all over the place
5/22/2011,not good enough!pls fix.
5/22/2011,"i did have a question about this in the 'devs answer any questions' thread... i will post a link to the answer, if and when we get one.meantime, keep supporting :-)"
5/22/2011,why are we still talking about this? should have all been implemented already
5/22/2011,"gallente: the battleship tiers is non sense. the price tag/bill of materials has nothing reasonable imho.you have the noob bs that becomes nasty stuff in the hands of some troglodyte full lvl5 skills (yes a few century's of game for those)the two gun bs's lack of pg/cpu/cap recharge/slots with price tags difference of 100%, skill intensive for both but only one is worthy and gives you for your isk in most situations -until you fly with minie counterpart and decide to cross train asap, but it's another thread story.honestly, what's the purpose of tiers system if the only [stuff] different is the build cost? -shouldn't the tiers system define specific roles related to lvl skills?"
5/22/2011,"save the t1 cruiser line up.things like the t1 logi'sewar ships like the bellicose and celestis.the omen and stabberthe thorax, moa, maller.poor fitting, slot layout, bonuses have plauged these ships. teir 2 battlecruisers are a similar price and can handle almost any role better. like the t1 logi's there role isn't even managed well do to poor fitting/cap/bonuses.ships like the punisher, maller and prophecy have a laser bonus so bad most people cram capless autocannons on. at least they gave the abaddon a dmg bonus along with the armor resist. the moa and ferox that both have less range and dmg then a good drake.some serious role redefine and balance changes would be nice.no more useless ships."
5/22/2011,this is important as now we can't even see what factions other factions like. this screws n00bs up that don't already have this info memorized.

5/22/2011,bring back npc corp and faction standings display for everyone.
5/22/2011,first time i find it usefull to post something...
5/22/2011,more grav sites and smaller existing belts are the best solution i've heard in a long time.now if only we can put an end to the endless ice fields...or just let the macro's congregate there and let hulkageddon take care of them.
5/22/2011,well this sure got dug up. do any of the csm care to say anything about this being a viable discussion with ccp?
5/22/2011,"i think it's a good idea, even if only to have another 'commodity' to fill up your cargo hold and haul from point a to point b.years ago on my mac i played an eve-like space game where you could make money as a hauler. one of the things offered in every station was passengers that wanted to get from point a to point b, as a way of filling out your cargo hold. it made hauling a lot more interesting, profitable, and fun. often, you would plan and arrange your routes and waypoints based on where the passengers wanted to go. the advantage that hauling passengers had over hauling cargo was that passengers was a guaranteed steady income, whereas you could lose money hauling commodities. in eve, these would be 'interbus' cargo missions. your passengers would be the 'livestock' in the market in eve. (tourists, homeless, etc.) generally the npc passengers would want to go from trade hub to trade hub, but a few of them might want to stop off at some mission hubs too. there is lots of opportunity here for ccp to add some storyline missions and background, such as 'tourists come to yalebap v to listen to the warbling of the air whales that float in the hydrogen clouds of this gaseous planet'. a great way for new players/ haulers to travel around eve, learn about the background story of eve, make more money, and have fun. of course you can also run passenger missions for the factions as well, such as ferrying slaves for carthum conglomerate, freed slaves for boundless creations, etc. in that case there should be a standings loss, so a 'neutral' amarr hauler in an npc corp that hauls slaves in amarr space will eventually find (s)he can't get passenger missions in the other three empires. you might lose standings with interbus too. in the game i played, jettisoning a cargo hold full of passengers was the fastest way to get a negative security standing. this was desirable in some ways, since only pirates could access 'pirate stations' in low-sec space. as for hauling actual players? i'm not as sure about the usefulness of this since everyone can fly at least a shuttle. i suppose it might be useful to contract out one of your jump clones to a hauler and have them take it to another station, along with all your goods. this might be convenient if someone has to move themselves and all their goods from a to b when they are offline. it might also be a way to get yourself and your goods into null-sec. this seems like it might be eliminating the danger/ risk of flying there yourself, but freighters and haulers can still be scanned and ganked, etc. so on the one hand, you can transport all your corps resources and players to a new system/ station at once. this saves an awful lot of game time for some. on the other hand, your corp could lose all of their players jump clones and ships, mods, etc. if that hauler gets ganked. pirates can now ransom each and every jump clone for as much as they would a pod...the pirates might even be able to scan what implants those jump clones have."
5/22/2011,"thanks for the support.i like this feature, because not only does it benefit haulers, it benefits pirates as well (as they seem to have a hard time making a living without resorting to their 'goodguy' alts) and it seems in line with the proposed bounty system fixes (which will buff out the mercenary professions). and as you mention, has many cool storytelling possibilities as well. especially with integration with dust514. i hope the csms give this more than the cursory once over."
5/22/2011,"""you must have tea and cake with the vicar or you die!"" (eddie izzard, dressed to kill)"
5/22/2011,"1) this is has nothing to do with making mistakes but getting rid off completely useless skillpoints. one of the best examples wich was contineusly discussed at forum is mining and all related skills to it.2)once your chare gets older it is true that t1 hull ships become useless to you, though skill requrment (like frigat/cruiser) for t2-t3 hulls will be not useless at all. so good sp investment.3) afraid that your shiny ship/guns will be nerfed/chaged next patch? do what i did and cross train weapons/ships skills. i'm not limited now to any gun or ship.4) there is still skills that uterly useless now and never will be used anymore. lot of chages by playerbase (bots/macro) and ccp (easy acseseble stuuf for new players) made those skills waste of time."
5/22/2011,"i don't get it, yes, it was wasted time, but why do you think you are entitled to get it back? people do all sorts of mistakes in this game, its part of living and learning.once per lifetime is completely arbitrary and silly. it will cause more problems than it aims to solve.and i don't see any problem with people getting stuck with their own poor choices in skills to invest in. would we want to give refunds to people who accidentally buy skillbooks of skills they already have trained? i'm sure that happens a lot too."
5/22/2011,"no sp remaps. yep, i have skills ill never use, and no, i dont agree with remaps. why? because everyone makes mistakes, that is life and lifes challenges. if you dont have to live with your mistakes, then what is the point of trying harder? but anyway, its a no from me."
5/22/2011,"haha, i like the idea of trading in isk + corpses for the very legal and popular drink. would add a need to pvp (or make a trial account and pod it ...)."
5/22/2011,"not sure how much i like this one since it would really only screw over those using cloaks to break gate camps, and they already have a weakness; being seen on overview for enough time to try and decloak them with a nice bump."
5/22/2011,i like the probe idea. nothing should uncloak a cloaked ship. it should be just that they become scannable with sufficient combat probe skills.
5/22/2011,"if a cloaker enters a system and appears in local system-wide, and let's say it takes 4 hours before he comes back to his computer, the carebear has 4 hours to see and react to this signal. if he doesn't i think it's safe to assume he's either botting or not paying attention. in either case, he's game to die, as it should be in 0.0."
5/22/2011,"yes, because your enemies should have to react and remain reacting for 4 hours, 24 hours, weeks, and months, while the cloaker shouldn't have to react to any threat at all. god forbid an ounce of a threat should be presented to you . that would just be too harsh and cruel for you in 0.0."
5/22/2011,"i support the cloak disruption generator with the 10-minute timer as originally proposed.i'm not so sure about probes being able to find cloaked ships. granted, any competent cloaker should be in motion, anyway, but with the recent probe interface changes, it's become really fast to find targets using probes. even a cloaker who is at the keyboard most of the time might need to go afk for a few minutes to go to the bathroom, for example."
5/22/2011,"the probe idea is bad. if you want a new game mechanic to gank people, why don't you just say so?all you're doing is suggesting ways that make it so you can solo or small gang gank cloakers. cov op's or otherwise. now you've got a suggested mechanic that means that no cloaked vessel will be able to travel through null or low security space, except through gate-to-gate means, and continuously warping around a system, which increases their chance of getting caught.they will no longer have time to pause, assess system choke points, figure out how to get past a camp safely, or anything else. for non-cov op's ships, this means that they are effectively sitting ducks, just like any non-cloaked ships. you've removed any functionality on black op's entirely, and made non-cov op's cloaks completely useless.if you really don't see it, then take a non-cov op's cloaker through a dozen occupied systems in null, or go smack talk some pirates in lowsec and see how long you can avoid them.418,491,116,101,718,882,050,375,000,000 km^3 the approximate volume of our solar system, if i've got that right.now imagine finding a small asteroid, (that just happens to be invisible), somewhere out there. or, try to imagine how much power it would require to flood that area with disruptive energy/radiation using the dispersion principle.anomalies are collections of various objects, (some quite large), that are potentially emitting varying degree's of energy and radiation, or simply have large masses wiuthin them, like gravimetric sites. this is why they can be scanned down. scanner probes that could lock on to a cov op's vessel would have to be much better than combat probes. how hard is it to scan down a frigate? mask any sensor and heat signatures, disrupt light around it, and effectively nullify any electromagnetic signatures on it, then move it slightly out of phase with normal matter, and you've got a cloaked vessel.if you can't detect it with ship sensors, or the naked eye, from 3 km, how do you expect to detect it out there? on grid is the only thing that makes sense, or the cooperative use of modules and specialized scan probes to detect them. too much work? tough! it's balanced and doesn't completely wipe out the usefulness of covert op's."
5/22/2011,"i like the idea, however:how can you define an active cloacker? -impossible to know who's behind his computer and who's afk you****.someone's idea about fuel requirements for cloaking devices was a pretty good idea coupled with some fuel bay."
5/22/2011,the only people afk cloakers hurt is botters.no way i will ever support anything that helps botters out and this proposal does nothing but help botters.
5/22/2011,"false statement.coming from someone of nc you should know since long time cloaked stuff: maybe hot drop, maybe intell maybe a lot of stuff, and at the bottom of all them, bots.unless you have too many in your systems but then you don't need new stuff, you need to better choose your corp/alliance members."
5/22/2011,well if the cloaker is gathering intel on you or getting ready to hot drop you; they are not afk are they?
5/22/2011,"supporting the idea, not the implementation."
5/22/2011,they should just disable local in jita. we dont need a chat channel there.
5/22/2011,"with the agent changes, one of the intent of ccp (clearly stated in their dev blog) was to allow people to live where they want.well, dear ccp, you just kicked me from where i wanted to live, and you are forcing me where i do not want to go.yes i'm talking about the agent inesmir jimud from sisters of eve; she was a security agent and she was changed to distribution with no reason.the nearest security agent from soe is 20 jumps away, not a big deal but.... it's 6 jumps from jita! oooh surprise!so, explain why you are moving this kind of agent near caldari space, where there are the majority of agents already, where there is the majority of traffic already. you want to spread people out you say, well it looks exactly the opposite, you are forcing people to move closer and closer to jita and already crowded places. i want to stay far away from jita, but you removed from the game the only agent i liked.tell me why.psno, this is not cross posting, i want to bring attention to both ccp and csm, and i'd like to read an answer, an explanation!"
5/22/2011,cry more.why not try one of the low or null sec soe agents? :)

5/22/2011,seems odd to the point of maybe someone made a mistake to take an agent in the security division and place them in the distribution division.
5/22/2011,"divisions like public relations that give 2/3 combat missions should be placed in security branch because it's majority combat. not sure why this isn't the case. in any case, i'm going to go ahead and set up a courier bot in gicodel to farm soe lp afk. it should be profitable now that it's all courier missions. just adapt to the changes."
5/22/2011,"bump, i want an official answer."
5/22/2011,"no, i was busy having a life. but the there do seem to be a few people who were adamantly attacking me for making suggestions that they didn't like that dont seem to be posting anymore. if they were banned or warned then im glad ccp is actively trying to combat players stopping other players from expressing their thoughts. the point of this forum is for the players to be able to tell ccp what they think is wrong with the game and discuss possible solution. sadly it has turned into a forum for a hand full of sad and lonely people to attack others whos opinions dont match their own. hence the near complete lack of player participation and constructive criticism"
5/22/2011,"to be fair, i think that you may have rubbed a lot of people the wrong way initially (myself included) because you posted 7 threads when you could have posted 1, and had an argument based on the terms of service of the game, which unfortunately set the 'lawyer hounds of hell' onto you."
5/22/2011,"i've never once attacked you, but i have pointed out the reasons why your ideas are bad.i've had neither a ban or a warning, because i have been constructive. the trouble is, you have to be factual with your ideas and responses. you also have to have an understanding of game mechanics and the consequences of any changes you may suggest. so far, you've done neither.then may i suggest, you stop doing it.the trouble is, being constructive means understanding what the issue is and you don't do either. if you had a solid argument, you would be able to back it up.edit: the fact that you've sidestepped/avoided answering the question i've asked repeatedly, in one of the many other threads you've made, speaks volumes."
5/22/2011,"move all profitable mining into lowsec/wh. then it won't be boring. pirates will take care of bots if you care about that. frankly i don't care. i just want to pvp so i'm glad they flood the market with cheap stuff. in fact i don't know why anyone cares what other people do in this game, isn't that the point of a sandbox? but if you want to mine and be excited, then mine where every second someone might decend upon you and pop you. but please don't get rid of roid belts. i enjoy pvp and so many fights seem to happen at the belts, plus there are times when a trip to null sec ratting is key to get sec status up without too much effort"
5/22/2011,"by now neither ccp greyscale, nor anybody else from ccp did give any feedback how that 0.0-nerf did work out.i can tell you for sure, it has lead to a vast devastation of 0.0. dozens, if not hundreds of renter corporations have just left 0.0. hundreds of systems are just outright empty now.the reason is clear: post-dominion-costs for most with pre-dominion-income. so most 0.0-systems will be even more devastated than ever before.ccp clearly violated the sandbox here as they didn't buffer the investments of the small corporations who fell victim to this change.it is my opinion that ccp greyscale willingly publicly gave false reasons why the implemented that nerf, so he and thus ccp was willingly and outright lying at their customers/playerbase. the only alternative explanation i see would be that ccp greyscale is outright extremely stupid and does have no plan how eve works.so i do support, ccp finally gives a public statement, why they:- implemented the 0.0-nerf (this time the real reason without any stupid lies)- lied to their playerbase- did not reimburse corporations and alliances who shortly before the nerf have heavily invested in 0.0 infrastructure and just got betrayed by ccp as they never had any chance to even amortize those investitions.- think, they could get those players they ****ed off the game by this nerf back with a buddy program.- thought they would not **** off 0.0-players/customers en masse when they outright r*pe them off their investitions ?0.0 as it is now:- no place for small alliances anymore, except for pro-miners- no decent income anymore for players, as ""good"" truesec systems are occupied by afk-cloak-cynos and thus unusable, the others are generally unusable.- pool only for a few powerblocks, as their income are the tech-moons.- those powerblocks are now in a league of its own, absolutely unreachable for any entity not in their league.in short:ccp greatly f*cked up 0.0 and they drove quite a number of players/customers off the game !"
5/22/2011,"now theres a though... would it be possible to have a 'ghost' neutral sit in all systems, just a little behind the scenes thing that isnt really there but tricks the bot into thinking theres a cloaked neut in system?"
5/22/2011,maybe there should be a forum completely dedicated to discussion all thinks cloak related.
5/22/2011,supported!!
5/22/2011,"i propose that cloaking devices be changed to use a sort of ""ammo"". i think this ammunition should be very small, .01m3, to allow covops frigs and other small ships to carry a decent quantity of it, and it should be made mostly of stont to help stimulate non-highsec ice mining. the cloaking devices should probably hold different amounts of ammo in order to give a benefit to better cloaks, and the cloaking skill should be changed to increase the cloaking device cycle time to allow for longer cloaking times before ""reloading"". a rough idea for numbers might be a base cycle time of 2 min, with covops cloak being able to hold .6m3 giving them a 2 hour run time between reloads and each cloaking level giving an increase of 12 seconds so with maxed skills there is a 3 min cycle giving 3 hours of uninterrupted cloaking with a covops cloak.the t2 cloak could have .4m3 giving a cloaking time range between 80 min and 2 hours. and the t1 could hold .2m3 giving a range between 40 min and 1 hour.the ammo being so small would allow a bomber loaded with bombs to carry enough ammo for around 10 days of continuous cloaking, much more for other ships and bombers without a full hold of bombs."
5/22/2011,"there isn't enough room in my blockade runner as it is, leave my cargohold alone."
5/22/2011,"a little too drastic a change for the problem its trying to solve, which is just to give defenders some type of method to combat stealth cloakers. this gimps all cloakers and will change how cloaking is used. not supported."
5/22/2011,"supported.people should remember that a t1 cloak would be able to hold 1 hour worth of cloak time without eating into the cargo hold at all.it is this kind of solution which isn't particularly intrusive, and doesn't require much work on ccp's part."
5/22/2011,"unless you planned on staying cloaked for days on end there would be almost no noticeable increase to cargo hold usage. a t2 cloak would allow you to stay cloaked for 21 hours using 6m3 of cargo hold. your argument of not having enough cargo hold is a weak one. further, if ccp felt that the issue of cargo space was a real one, they could give all ships designed to have covops cloaks a small boost in cargo hold capacity in order to compensate for what they feel is a reasonable amount of time to remain cloaked without resupplying.the problem its trying to solve is the invulnerability of cloaks and the lack of input needed by the player to use them. this mechanic would make cloaking a dynamic and frankly more fun. it is certainly far from drastic in any way and frankly would have no noticeable affect for those using cloaks to break gate camps or other average uses. the only players that would even notice this change would be the ones who use cloaks for an extended amount of time."
5/22/2011,"meaning those that travel deep into enemy territory to scout activities. or anyone wanting to use a covert ops ship, for exactly what it was intended for.in other words, every active cloaking pilot would be nerfed.yet another bad idea, not supported."
5/22/2011,"hi t'raq.nobody likes this idea either, and nobody but you and like, 5 other dudes (and your herd of alts) seems to feel this is a problem.have you considered the possibility that 0.0 space just isn't your cup of tea?i mean, cloaks have been here for about forever, and people have been laying traps for them forever, you just don't seem to care to put out the effort to catch the cloaked ships (yes, they can actually be caught if you simply try) and instead spam the forums with topics about something that is literally not on the radar for ccp because nobody cares, we've been catching these dudes for years.you'll ignore this response like you do in every thread you spam, but have faith, in every spammed thread you make, i will be there reminding you how silly you look.have a nice day!"

5/22/2011,"it shouldnt restrict cargo bay. make a fuel bay if anything and leave cargoholds alone. using 'fuel' to cloak might be an alright idea as it would bring something else to the production. i use covops often and personally wouldnt like needing a fuel cost to be added to my isk sinks, but eh, whatever."

5/22/2011,"100% agree with you, though the discussion has evolved a bit since then elenasa. the basic premise is the same, but i have since agreed that it's not a high pri, and is part of a much larger issue which is that baddies need to cheat (metagame) because they cannot survive otherwise, and in order to fix this we need to establish a more robust way of determining ""trust"" between players. sec status was designed to address this, but the system has holes in many places. (money transfers, plus all the others that anna brought up like can stealing etc.) it's a tough problem. not one that we can solve in 1 uber fix. but i think having fiscal accountability is a start. now we just need to minimize the loophole in my system (contracting goods for purposes of moving isk, etc). most of which i have not enough experience in the game to think of."

""problem"" solved without the need for your worthless idea."
5/23/2011,i would love a tp for low slots... it would let me put on a webber plus one point on the mids and not have to reduce the tank of the drake by too much...yes reduce the max target range aswell no point in making a ship target further then it can hit...yes a slight hml nerf (reduction in flight time) with an all around missle boost will make things better by adding asl's...what i am looking to do is first and formost reduce the affectivness of hml drakes... and secondly introduce the ability for other non used missle ships for pvp... its all about variety... and just reducing targeting range without changing flight time is only a half fix... not a total fixand no i dont think a velocity boost should 'just' be built into the game...in guns you have tracking comps and te... tp affects all weapon types including drones missles and turrets...drones have a tracking boost mod just like guns... missles dont and they should!plus tp has range restrictions... the asl does not...its not a worthless mod just because you dont understand its uses...for me i would put the scrip that increases the velocity on the mid slot variation for my sac.. now i can get some decent range out of my hamms... (by reducing a drakes targeting range and using a tp does not allow me to do this at all)i know its hard for you to think outside of your zombie responces but please use your brain before responding next time
5/23/2011,"oh, you'd like to nerf every other weapon's max range then? because there are an absurd number of ships that can shoot further than they can lock.also it's not about how far they can shoot. missiles are not turrets, and by nerfing flight time you'd also be nerfing their ability to follow a moving target. reduce targeting range by 20km. again, same effect as the idiotic missile nerf idea without the need to add new modules.yes, it should, because flight time is utterly absurd. try using cruise missiles or even heavies at long range sometime.the problem with this being...?hint: missile range rigs exist. idiot. yawn. another moron that thinks just because their idea is different it's better. stop trying to fix what isn't broken. missiles are not turrets, stop trying to change them based on the premise that they are. if you want the drake nerfed, make your post based on that - don't try and patronize people by hiding it under a (ridiculous) blanket change to missiles in general."

5/23/2011,"i'll shoot down any idea that's as poorly justified and thought out as that rubbish, thanks."
5/23/2011,i know her name should be douche...perhaps she should read the op but they are looking for all sorts of ideads even crazy ones like mine.... reducing targeting range would not be going far enough but at this point it think douche starmarkonherbum will just try to troll everything... as it stands the arguments points are there to be read... if you support sound arguments... then its clear who one... if you support... i am right and its final and if you suggest i am wrong i will just call you a moron and idiot... then its clear you are an alt.. thanks
5/23/2011,1. no i want the range nerfed and target nerfed so if you want to snipe (like most other ships in game) you need a range incraese mode and a sensor booster or sig amp... this would force the drake to fit both... 2. no just reducing targeting range will not be enough to bring the drake inline with toher tier two bc's...3. no it should not be built in... i would rather see obsurd low flight time with obsurd fast velocity... (this could help offest the lag effect of lots of missles on field at once)4. yes missle range is flight time times velicity... why are you mentioning this?5. the problem being is that missles dont have a mod that works like a te/tc just for missles... all other weapon platforms do... having the als would fix this...6. even though you admit you are bored with the argument and that you claim only your half assed fixes will work... how about you stop constantly reading the forums and go out and play the game or better yet enjoy real life like getting laid or something because its clear you have way to much on your time to waiste by trolling important internet space ship games...
5/23/2011,i see the thread has dissolved into a dumb flamewar (and i'm not reading all of that crap to find out what it's about and who is right/wrong).can we get a csm in here to tell us whether the thread was useful to get the point across to ccp?
5/23/2011,"ok, so if you want to make missiles equal to turrets, let them hit for full damage on a low transversal targets and let them reach their targets instantly.if you want them to have all the drawbacks of turrets, they should get the benefits as well.see why your point is stupid yet?you wanted a missile range nerf. i can see some sense in that in this particular case - reducing lock range is a very elegant solution.yep, this is a great thing. but it shouldn't need mods to do so. remember this affects more than just the drake.no, what i meant was - missiles have to deal with taking time to reach their targets. at long distances this can make them unusably bad.stop. treating. missiles. like. turrets.seriously.get this through your head. they don't have such a module because they don't need one, and shouldn't need one.yawn, more ad hominem rubbish from someone with nothing else to say."
5/23/2011,1. again you dont understand and i feel sorry for you about it...2. cool there is some common ground 3. yeah thats the point more then just the drake for pvp would be nice... you want it made into missle before a mod i want it made after a mod... tomato potato type of thing i guess...4. yeah i hear that ever used cruise missles at 200 km? its kinda a joke... but having a mod to increase thier velocity would make them travel alot faster and inasmuch get to thier destination much faster... as you said you want this built in i would prefer a mod for this...5. i do think they need a mod... you dont... i know missles are different and i like that about them... this is a different way of achiving increase to tracking and optimal range... you have ex velocity for the tracking and velocity for the range... i like the idea of mid range hamms and torps... (and not just on caldari ships i mean)6. i will leave it at just that... lets move on shall we to another topic? you have to admit the drake/missle talk is overdone at this point? right my water for private parts buddy?
5/23/2011,"mining being boring is a given, but lets be honest. its not that there isn't enough ore out in null sec space, i mean i have been out there and see the huge fields just filled with resources.the difference is that there is no real incentive for the real hardcore mining corps to come out there and work it.i have seen huge mining operations devour the rocks through several systems, three orca, and dozens of hulks mining as a group can move hundreds of millions of cubic meters of rock per hour. but if an alliance isn't going to make it worth their while whats the point of taking the risk"
5/23/2011,"most players did not sign up to play ice road truckers in space. hauling is not fun. escort duty is not fun. the more hauling, the more escort, the less fighting. anything that messes with the amount of dead ships per hour is going to be a big jolt to the market. this would do that.why is it the job of an alliance to make mining worth the risk? what incentive is there for the alliance? if ccp wants people in null sec, then there needs to be carrots in the game for being in null. if they want people to mine low end ores in null, then they either need to get rid of the high ends that we mine (because you make a lot more per hour doing that) or dramatically increase the load/hour you get from low ends in null."
5/23/2011,"i'm not sure it it's possible to encourage industry in nullsec without nerfing hisec industry. ccp approach obviously is to nerf freighters and jump gates, but i don't think it will work. did people manufacture stuff in nullsec before jb-s? (seriously, i didn't play back then)so reduce slots in hisec, add taxes in hisec, if you want to buff nullsec. not sure if it's good for game tho"
5/23/2011,"so you want to do two thinigs it seems; 1)increase industrialization of nullsec, and make the resources for that industrialization ""burnable"" or breakable.these two goals appear to work against each other. making the resources for industry breakable is a deterrent for doing the industry. in essence, if you create some industry, with local resources, you are providing a target. the target gets hit, and your benefits go down. if the benefits are perceived as less than the cost, the industry will go back to high sec.the other question that seems to be missed, is the one about the small groups. the reason for making the resources breakable is so that small groups have a means to attack large alliances other than direct sov assaults. why would a small group want to disrupt resources by burning the fields? what does a small group gain from this? isnt the only reason sov is challenged is in order to gain access to the resources in that area? so instead of ""burning"" the fields, which only serves to deny access to the larger alliances temporatrily, make it so that the resource can be temporarily taken over. you dont want to burn the field, you want to steal the field. this is the benefit that would encourage small groups to organize raids into sov space. but, it still appears that this feature would have an inverse relationship on the creation of industry in nullsec."
5/23/2011,"most people don't sign up to do it in real life either.in eve.in eve.the opposite actually.part of building an empire is providing protection and infrastructure for its denizens.economic independence? the ability to just about ignore the existence of hi sec %99 of the time.there are plenty of carrots, but eve is a game about spreadsheets and people who metagame first and play second.honestly, this makes little sense. low end ore in null is far nicer to mine than anything in hi sec, for many reasons. you have big fat veld moons you can chew on for hours, the need for this material is immediate, and mining in null isn't as dangerous as most think. if even half of the null sec 'empires' declared economic independence from hi sec, the hi sec market would go up in price 35-60% across the board. which could be taken advantage of with strategic exporting.prices in null would balance out with prices in empire in a matter of weeks."
5/23/2011,"people have almost always hauled low end minerals, ships, modules from high sec to low sec.try selling that game. penn and teller made a game like that once upon a time. it was extremely boring. hard to convince people to spend money to be a truck driver in a video game. because, not sure if you noticed this, but this is a video game that people pay to play.in real life too.and in real life.the occasional small gank that you, in your uber leetness, enjoy does not compare to the sheer destruction of the current null sec wars. if everyone is hauling (and that's assuming most people don't say ""screw this"" and leave) there won't be many large fights. that's bad for the economy in eve.would you haul stuff on a regular basis through low sec and null sec for a couple million isk when you can make it doing something else? null sec is specialized (currently) as an isk faucet, a moon mineral faucet, and a high end mineral faucet. further beloweconomic independence is a stupid idea. it is terrible in real life and the economy in eve is big enough where it would be a terrible idea there too.then why do so many null sec players spend a chunk of their time running missions and other things in high sec?silly to compare to empire. if you have something that will give you 20m isk/hr and something that will give you 5m isk/hr sitting right beside it, which would you mine?"
5/23/2011,"being in npc corp, and seeing a metric ****-ton of 0.0 alts, the usual responses are:1) because of cta2) because of blob/cloakies/camppeople's desire not to create a lossmail, which they will most likely be mocked for, is (imo) a driving factor of why people go to highsec. the relative safety means that they can afk when they want, or at least dont have to pay attention the whole time. not everyone wants to be ""on"" 100% of thier game time. increasing rewards of null/decreasing rewards of empire wont change any of this.as an aside: the ""its not fun"" argument is a little dubious in my eyes. few people pay to train skills or think that waiting 50+ days for some long skill to finish is ""fun"". yet, so far, few people would be willing to completely do-away with skills (although i wouldnt be surprised to see this whine crop up more and more). plain and simple we endure skill training because we want the result of that training. same thing could be said of hauling/mining. either way, i dont care if these things get nerfed/buffed/whatever. i have no horse in this race.this.even if it was made possible, it wouldnt work long term. if the nullsec community isolated themselves from highsec economically, the mineral markets would take a severe beating just based on the shear volume of minerals and soon-to-be minerals (modules purchased below mineral cost) created in highsec. once mineral prices got low enough it would, once again, be significantly cheaper to purchase mins/modules in highsec and ship it.... meaning there would be no real change from the current scenario.not that any of this thread matters now since the summit is already in progress."
5/23/2011,"sad to see this thread only have 6 pages of discussion on it thus far.nullsec will never fundamentally change until you make the distance traveled much longer in real time. it was this way in 2003, and you really felt like you were out in the wilds. but with the addition of the ""super highways"", smugglers gates, and capital jumping...distance shrunk. local markets will never really flourish if it is fairly easy to just jump your stuff near a major hisec trade hub (and vice versa)."
5/23/2011,hmm you have regular galexy... then you have worm hole space... how about have worm hoel space lead to a hole new galaxy?make it a sub orbital galaxy like there are two of them orbiting the milkky way... have it be 5000 new solar systems without stargates... the systems are only linked (at first) with worm holes... ccp introduces a new ship called motherships... which can setup new star gates (basically the mother ship is a mobile station with a jump bridge that can go from system to system...this will be the real wild west... vast! and hard to find... and would force people to setup industrial zones to stay alive...
5/23/2011,"let's add drone implants, and modules to the ccp wish list."
5/23/2011,"supported, make them bigger. make normal carriers bigger as well."
5/23/2011,+1.no one asked to remove the standings in the first place.
5/23/2011,"gm zerat------------------------------------------------------------------------hi,this was a design decision to prevent players from tracking down pilots by monitoring their standings towards npc corporations. i'm afraid we cannot discuss the merits of game design decisions through petitions, the appropriate place to discuss that are the forums.--------------------------------ok so forums it is. :)tracking down pilots ? you do have the locator agents if you want to track somebody that bad... the bottom line is if somebody wants to track you they will and it has nothing to do with standings most of the time. on the other hand as mentioned above a lot of people lost very important tool in they eve life. a social orientation beacon if you will.bring it back before its to late ! such changes make eve single player game. it supposed to be about player cooperation not about isolation. ... also a suggestion here: if quite a lot of people think they need standings gone, just make it optional ... like medals or certificates.another thing which i am personaly not happy about and which adds to standing window lag is that it shows all the agents. that is the usless bit which is quite large ... if you would get wrid of that bit nobody would be to upset i think."
5/23/2011,"i prefer it like it is now. either that or make it so that whenever you'd press ""show info"" it never opens in the standings bar. i don't care about standings, but sometimes want to check out someone's bio. so whenever i'd show info and it opened the standings tab, it'd lag my client for 3-10 seconds (especially if it was a corp and/or had many standings to show). actually, it would be optimal if it opened both corporations and characters in the bio-tab, please."
5/23/2011,"not really. locator agents cost isk to use. they cost time to use, and effort. it's like hiring a pi to find out if your husband is cheating on you. you'll get your info, but you sort of have to know what/who you are looking for. standings are free information, which anyone can browse as they watch people pass by jita. its like browsing the airport to see if you can find a mark. it has no cost (besides opportunity cost) and allows gankers to find carebears from the sea of anonymous players.yeah, optional is fine i think."
5/23/2011,aijle mijleroff is absolutely right!!!!
5/23/2011,"aijle mijleroff, you are right fella. return it back!"
5/23/2011,"bring them back, if needed for some stupid idea that players have 'free' intel and this is a lame 'isk sink' to make locator agents more useful then so be it. standings should be shown by default for new players until they are either off their trials, or older than 14 days, the rest of the players should have npc corp standings shown by default with agents hidden. all tutorial agents should always be shown, if they have been used, if not they are invisible like it was save the very first tutorial agent. if the reason was db calls let standings be on a tab that is by default not shown, ie even if you always look at standings when you show info on a pilot you then have to click over to the standings tab. further each corporation should have an expandable tab that opens to show agent standings for that corp only. faction standings would be the default standings shown under the standings tab and always be shown for all pilots."

5/23/2011,"fof missiles are, without doubt, broken if they target inanimate objects over aggressing ships, so yes, full support to making them only strike ships and nothing else. i don't think it's fair to say you could pick targets though, that's making them op.however how's this for an idea, target painter modules, also considered pretty second rate in many circles, could be used to mark targets for fof missiles:in normal circumstances the missiles should attack the closest aggressive ship and ignore structures and drones, but if target painters are used they will attack the nearest painted target in range, therefore making two of eve's less favoured items much more viable while hopefully still being balanced"
5/23/2011,"the problem: number of ships invulnerable to scan has been steadily increasing lately. i find ship being able to do anything useful with efficiency close to the scannable setups while staying invulnerable to scan bad practice. unscannable ships are commonly used for safe pve or gang boosting; although there may be other usages, they're neglectable.proposed solution is described in this thread:"
5/23/2011,/supporting own proposal
5/23/2011,agree :)
5/23/2011,"not entirely sold on your solution, but on it being a problem? absolutely."
5/23/2011,"i support this. i have no problem with afk-cloakers or whatever, because they are cloaked and therefore shouldn't be seen/scanned. however, i often see unprobablet3s used to boost pvp gangs; not only making fleet command ships fairly redundant, but i don't see why anything should be able to stay uncloaked but still invulnerable to scanner probes.t3s has made command ships quite redundant in many situations (as they generally do the same things a bit better, at much less of the training time, but at a slightly higher cost), i think cs' should at least be superior in, well, boosting the gang."
5/23/2011,"just support.in fact, i'm using un-scannable configurations too. but, i think, there must be some real competition between scanner-man and 'unscannable' man. op proposition isn't ideal but fine as first step in right direction.(maybe, some active decoys? or stuff)"
5/23/2011,"not supported.for unscannable fleetboosters, just apply a penalty to the warfare processor subsystems that reduces the sensor strength of a strategic cruiser for each gang link module that's fit. alternately, you can make a very strong flat penalty to the sensor strength just for having a warfare processor subsystem. in either case, a sufficiently strong penalty will make the strategic cruiser probable.regarding unprobable pve ships, i'm under the impression that pve fits are generally useless in pvp. are there any effective pvp fits that can also effectively solo missions? ...and in what levels of missions? the reason i ask is because if pvp fits can't run missions solo, then missions should be changed so that pvp fits can run missions solo before we go breaking or weakening unprobable pve ships."
5/23/2011,"only cloaked ships should be unscannable. if you actively affect the universe, you should be able to be probed out. i'm fine with such ships being much harder than regular vessels to scan down, but it shouldn't be impossible.support for the general idea."
5/23/2011,"you're just wrong. any mission which is doable in nonstop-cap pve setup is doable in pvp setup (cap booster, yeah). in fact, some of the lowsec mission runners i know use pvp setups to run lvl 4's. recent changes to missions introduced ability to use such pvp module as mwd on all missions - for ships like ac-capbooster mach it's almost finalized pvp-setup."
5/23/2011,support
5/23/2011,supporting a nerf to riskless pve in null and low sec.
5/23/2011,"the way it is done is enter system look around and try to catch someone not paying attention then drop them. then go afk for a few hours so people will be meh afk and go back to ratting, and then drop them with a decent sized covert fleet or maby even a standard fleet by titan bridge depending on ship and if system is cyno jammed or not. the local spike will make people all like wtf and a standing fleet might not engage for they dont know what they are up against, and by the time they figure out what it is the ratters are dead and the gang is 10 jumps out. then go afk again and repeat."
5/23/2011,"bolded the problem.maybe don't rat by yourself? have some gang members on standby to s.o.s. you? falcon alt? set a trap? rat in a pvp ship? bottom line is there is several ways to deal with cloakers. your just be lazy.stop being such a ***** and fight.and the reason they are all dead is because they have cowards for protection. maybe try high sec ratting. seems more of the game style you are looking for.all in all, working as intended."
5/23/2011,"^^ see, this guy gets it"
5/23/2011,then you agree that someone not paying attention should be able to die? because that's exactly what an afk cloaker does when he walks away from the keyboard in the middle of 0.0; he's not paying attention.
5/23/2011,"but you see, he doesn't get it. he doesn't even know what an afk cloaker is. he's using the literal definition to defend his position. it's like saying a guard dog doesn't bite because, according to the literal definition, it only ""guards"". or it's like saying you can't take cough medicine on a teaspoon because a teaspoon only holds ""tea""."
5/23/2011,"then stop relying on local, as an instant intel tool. afk cloakers, are simply subverting locals intel power."
5/23/2011,"ccp got rid of local for wh systems, and then they felt that since there was no local they should also kill cynos in those systems and make their entrances limited and cause them to move constatly making it much harder for a group of players to organize an attack on those systems. ccp has never, however, created a situation where cloakers are anything but completely safe once in a system. they have clearly thought about your idea(getting rid of local) and felt that it was a poor one for the general population. a way to counter cloaking however has not yet been formally discussed by ccp."
5/23/2011,"they are still thinking about it, they have yet to arrive at a suitable replacement."
5/23/2011,supported.
5/23/2011,"i would support this or the cloaking device fuel idea. the concept that someone can have an effect on my gameplay when they aren't playing, i.e. in bed sleeping or at the bar drinking without an appropriate counter measure boggles my mind. being able to log on, cloak, go afk for whatever times frame you want when no one can counteract you is not balance. those who say its balanced are the ones who abuse this system."
5/23/2011,"i want to reduce afk cloaking, or at least add a possible downside, the fact that it allows for more ganking is a nice fringe benefit.this would not help solo ganking, since announcing to the system and crippling your ship would be a very large risk. i don't see how this impedes travel, if you can't make it through a system cloaked within 10 minutes and really want to get through the system just log off and wait instead of walking away from the computer (or windowing to wot or whatever) while cloaked. or stay active and warp whenever they light a detection field and laugh as they throw away isk. it's hardly an ""i win"" button, it just gives the hunting party some way to have a chance of finding their prey.i have traveled through 0.0, and i very rarely stay in a system for 10 minutes today. i either see i can get through quickly, take the risk of running a camp that could catch me with enough bubbles and skilled ceptor pilots, or i wait a few hours or days to get through, which is just as easy and safe to do logged off.black ops ships can use covert cloaks, so can warp around safely, and black ops gangs can warp between safes or just reactivate their cloaks with not much more danger than today. non-covert ships can just recloak if they're at a safe (or better yet warp to a new safe before cloaking again), so there is a bit more danger, but they are hardly just as vulnerable as a ship with no cloak.first, this is internet spaceships, so please tell be how the current tiny probes carry enough energy to warp across the solar system and scan half the solar system for over an hour at a time.second, who says you have to fill the solar system with energy, or even if you do that you have to produce it? the obvious weak spot of cloaking devices is that they turn off when the ship gets too close to an object, so why not just fool all ships into thinking there's an object next to the ship for a split second? even if you do want to fill the system with energy, there's already this big star doing just that, so perhaps a few tweaks to the solar radiation or magnetic field could disrupt cloaks.on grid only decloaking doesn't help stop afk cloakers."
5/23/2011,"i changed my mind, i really like this idea. the first time i read it i was thinking it was a mod that would only decloak cloaked ships on your grid for some reason.as far as stopping cloaking ships from traveling through systems easily, thats complete garbage. its just another excuse by afk cloakers to avoid having to start working for their kills. they are clearly running out of even half viable arguments for leaving cloaks alone the way they are. but to completely end this weak argument, the cycle time for the mod could easily be increased to allow even more time for a cloaked ship to get out of a system (even though 10 min is more than enough) though im sure if you said it should have a 2 hour timer they would still make the same complaint. even if a cloaked ship were completely trapped in a system they could warp around the system easily avoiding scan probes. if hey can't manage to survive by cloaking and warping and cloaking and warping long enough to sneak out of the system then they deserve to lose their ship."
5/23/2011,"you've yet to come up with a good reason for any change.but it's starting to look more and more like you want a cloak nerf, irrespective of the afk aspect."
5/23/2011,"as part of an attempt to insert some constructive comments and suggestions in here, i would like to ask that ccp at some point (much sooner rather than later) review the npc corps and there agents and more evenly distributed there agents a bit more evenly accross there factions space and some additional agents for those lacking in either agents all together or ones of certain levels like amarr navy security agents where over half the lvl 4 security are in low sec and the rest are at oposite ends of amarr space. and it looks like the single .5 agent is going to get a bit crowded, so much for letting folks live where they want"
5/23/2011,i agreestill waiting for an explanation btw.
5/23/2011,"ya, my goal was to make noise. think the moderator thought it was funny to lock all the reasonable thread and leave that one open.there are other people in this forum. not everything i say is directed at you. you should really stop taking every comment so personal.i have answered you question several time. you ignore the answer because you have no reply."
5/23/2011,"i didn't actually say you directed anything at me, i merely pointed out i hadn't attacked you. at least read my replies, before commenting.you seemed to be taking the rejection of your ideas personally, with that 'few people' comment.you've not actually answered the question asked directly, but simply side stepped it.so in the interest of fair play, i'll ask again:-if like you suggested, people that are cloaked get removed from local, why after that change, do you still think a mechanic to stop them going afk is still needed?"
5/23/2011,"and i will answer yet again. whether they are visible in local or not, the facts that cloaking makes a ship invulnerable and leaves no way for other players to affect the cloaked ship and also requires no input from the player who wishes to remain cloaked means that cloaking a ship in space makes it completely invulnerable in every way, is the only situation in eve in which a player can walk away from their computer for days on end and have no fear of losing their ship while it is in space. it is a flawed mechanic and should be fixed so that even when cloaked there is a possible way for a player in a cloaked ship to be in danger, no mater how minute that danger is or how much effort those trying to find the cloaked player have to put out."
5/23/2011,"so your saying that even when people are removed from local and are not seen, they will continue to afk? even though the whole point is being seen, hoping to develop psychological warfare effects upon those in local?that reply of yours, makes it look like you are simply after cloaks full stop. rather like whole afk stuff is a smoke screen.do you really know and understand the subject at hand, or are you making it up as you go?"
5/23/2011,"guys, please stay on topic, local changes is not part of this proposal.if you want to discuss local and other issues, please do it in your/appropriate topic."
5/23/2011,good idea
5/23/2011,"please get rid of bs npc's while you're at it.and remove whs, please.and could you snag lvl 4 missions as well?i'm a miner, so why should i care how pvp'ers earn isk?...on topic:did (any) csm ever actually talk about mining with ccp? (serious discussion)haven't been able to find anything :s"
5/23/2011,nothing will ever change mining it seems. those macro mining bots give ccp 15 bucks a month (regardless of purchasing plex's which someone spent 35 bucks getting or not).
5/23/2011,"i don't mine either (like you said, it's boring) but i like these ideas."
5/23/2011,"i have moved to a different profession just before the nerf and i have trained a few high sec alts. i barely rat anymore i only pew pew with my 2x pvp toons in 0.0. why bother with roaming gangs, cloakers, hot dropers, whatever while you rat in your expensive pve ship when you can make the same isk in high sec.ccp has this all backwards. high sec should have been a training ground and you should move to low sec/0.0 where the end game is (or at least should be). 90% people in high sec and only 10% in low/0.0 is the problem. it should be the other way around. i know many of you wouldn't like so many people in 0.0 but ccp can make the universe just bigger.severly nerfing high sec or for all i care put it on a different server can only give low sec/0.0 life any meaning.move level 4 mission to low sec, deplete the asteroid fields in high sec. this would be the low sec/0.0 buff. people would be willing to make risk to go to richer grounds now they just dont have the incentive.but i know ccp wouldnt do this they just don't have the balls to do it and no matter how much you advertise eve as being a cold and harsh univers it just isn't you can grind in high sec in complete safety."
5/23/2011,cloaks are not the problem. the free warning you get from local is. remove local from 0.0!
5/23/2011,"yeah and why not remove all rats from eve against botters, that makes as much sense as this topic.anyway cloaks means being risk free in space, that is wrong and carebearish."
5/23/2011,no it means working as intended. the issue is that you can see them and your reliance on local is being subverted.
5/23/2011,to everyone who complains about afk cloakers. can i have your stuff?
5/23/2011,"covops can warp cloaked and can lock you down before lighting a cyno, a frig is also takes a good bit of time to lock in any larger ship so even if there are several of you ratting together you can be locked down long enough for an enemy gang to jump into system and warp to you no problem. cloaked ship do pose a real threat, as they should. they can also walk away from the computer for days on end without worrying about losing their ship, which they shouldn't be able to do."
5/23/2011,i would like to know how you manage to login after downtime and still stay away from your computer for days. you also know about the locking penealty on cloaked ships after decloaking (excluding bombers) right?
5/23/2011,these changes also prevent bomber gate camps. you sit cloaked for quite a while there too and only uncloak on tasty targets. i'm still baffled why anyone who isn't botting would have a problem with someone sitting cloaked 24/7 in their system. they aren't doing anything. why worry about it?
5/23/2011,"please define the term ""afk"" in this context."
5/23/2011,"seriously? your arguing that they aren't afk because they log on and click the cloak button, that takes about 3 min and can easily be done with a macro.also, you do know bombers can fit cynos right."
5/23/2011,"you know that you can fit a cyno jammer to a pos when you hold sov, right?"
5/23/2011,"there are several unintended consequences with the new agent changes for missions. in some of the more isolated regions the number of security agents has decreased. perhaps these regions need to be addressed on an as needed basis, and increase their number of combat agents. a region that had several agents like public relations, and other types that had a higher than 50% chance of combat mission had many choices to get those combat missions. declining a mission was not too bad, because there was another agent in the same corp you could go to. now, the number of agents available for combat missions has decreased. some of those combat missions now give out many more low-sec and faction missions. because of the lack of available combat agents, and the increase of less desirable missions, this is cutting into mission time dramatically. i dont want to do faction missions so i decline. i get a good mission and complete it. then i get a low-sec mission, where the low-sec system may be busy, so i want to decline that mission too. but i can't because of the 4 hour timer. i can only run 1 out of 3 or 4 of every mission offered from my desired agent. where as, before the change, i did not have this issue. one way to fix this unintended consequence is to get rid of the mission decline timer. this way, if i can only choose between 4 different level 4 agents, each from a different corp, i can still choose the agent working for the corp that i want. either that, or increase the number of security agents/ per corp in the more isolated regions. proposal: get rid of the mission decline timer.oh and add a number of jumps column to the agent list for corps."

5/23/2011,"siege module penalties make it difficult for dreads to do their jobs. a siege dread has trouble hitting a moving carrier or super carrier without prop modules. that is absurdly stupid. i suggest a a lower reduction in tracking like 25-30%. dread guns still can't hit small **** out of siege mode anyways, so why gimp it so much that it has trouble hitting huge ass ships?scan res penalty does little in terms of balance and only hurts dreads even more. its important to be able to quickly lock and get a shot, titans and super carriers don't have to deal with this issue. a nyx's base scan res is nearly triple the base scan res of a dread in siege mode. siege timer in capital fights are much too long, it should be reduced to 5 minutes. these penalties are medieval and archaic, they need to be reduced or need to go."
5/23/2011,"i suspect ccp are attempting to nerf dreads to oblivion, only to bring them back a bit op in the future when we least expect it.that said, i agree with the changes. also think they should do a bit more damage and have bonuses to buffer tank rather than active tank. but that's just me."
5/23/2011,i find it rather amusing the largest and slowest ships in the game can speed tank a sieged dread.
5/23/2011,i know this will be flammed but how about a capital webber? goes like 70km 80% reduction in speed... has heavy pg cost... would be cool... though reducing the tracking would be nice too....
5/23/2011,as show info no longer shows a players standings and there is no other way to find this info out ingame i propose the following...a locator agents report on a players whereabouts should now include a snap shot of their standings at the time of the query.as this information is valuable to both the player and the interested party the fee for standings information should be raised.each query within a set time should cost more per query too.5 mil 0-2 searches last 30 days7.5 mil 3-4 searches last 30 days10 mil 4-6 searches last 30 days
5/23/2011,"you are forgetting the markets. you will need refineries and reactions to make this new ammo, people to haul it around, sell it, etc etc. maybe you'll get stuck in 0.0 with no supply of it, or have it at inflated prices. stront at 200-400 per unit at 3m3 volume, with your proposed 0.01m3 of this new stuff that would mean a super isk density per m3, making haulers capable of moving buckets of this stuff around in freighters making insane profits reprocessing it unless you only put a little stront in it. not saying that any of these things aren't possible. just wanted to mention that it affects more than you think, and all just to address the problem of afk cloakers? put another way, i don't think you need to nerf any cloakers in empire space. haulers have enough problems already trying to avoid gankers to have to worry about buying fuel for their cloaks. you really just care about 0.0 sec. so i say stick with the pos module idea. you want 'safer' space? build a pos and outfit it to make the cloakers combat probe-able. cloakers don't like that? blow up their pos module. starve their stront/ice supplies. play balanced. done in time for dinner."
5/23/2011,"i have not and will not post on these forums with any character other than this one. here's a thought, not everyone wants this game to turn into a stagnant cesspool of flawed game play. maybe, just maybe, there are other players out there that don't actually agree with you that cloaking isn't broken. my guess is that you and most of the people who do agree with you actually know that cloaking is broken, you are just the ones taking advantage of it and are terrified of seeing a day when its fixed and you actually have to work for your kills.i know cloakers can be caught, the issue is that they can only be caught and killed if they screw up, there is no way for those trying to kill them to actively persu them. you must set a trap, hope the cloaker is currently at the computer, and hope he takes the bait before the player who have set the trap with you decided they are tired of sitting and waiting. every aspect of the engagement is in the favor of the cloaker, and there is no possible way for those trying to catch a cloaker to take control of any part of the situation.and i believe the reason that cloaking isn't on ccps radar is because every time someone comes on these forums and says they think cloaking is broken they get flamed by the six players who troll these threads while they have their toon cloaked in a 0.0 system and eve minimized. i think its pretty awesome that after one day of persistantly bumping my thread to the top of the list there are now half a dozen other thread that have been started talking about the same thing. hopefully after a few weeks ccp will actually start to think about thinking about talking about having a discussion about the subject. frankly, if a dev came out and said that ccp liked afk cloaking, felt that it was exactly what they were looking for when they introduced cloaks (which have not been around ""about forever"" by a long shot), and was fully indorced by ccp, i would never bring the subject up again. as it stands right now, they have said that they know its an issue but they haven't really gotten around to talking about it yet. i, and i assume the other players posting these threads, are simply trying to show ccp that its a big issue for us and we think its time they sit down and decide where they stand"
5/23/2011,"stront is not isk dense, trit is around 3 times as isk dense as stront is so im really not sure what your talking about there. as far as inflated costs, in my experience ammo is pretty easy to make yourself and if 1 run made a larger batch it could worked to be pretty cheap. say 10 units of stront and a hand full of some minerals creating 1000 units would probably give you 5-10 isk per unit which is far less isk dense than most minerals and in the same ball park as most actual ammo. lets assume on the high end of 15isk per unit for production and a 100% markup would give you 3,000isk per m3. most other ammo is in the range of 500-5000 isk per m3, t1 ammo that is. if we look at minerals, isogen is generally in the range of 2-3k per m3 as one of the cheaper minerals, megacyte is around 100 times that. further, the only reason i suggested stront may be a good material is because it is obtained in limited quantities in high sec ice belts which i believe is where all the macro miners are. it could just as easily use lo or heavy water or any other material that the devs see fit. admittedly i had not thought about most of this, but that took me a whole 10 min to work out. the devs are probably a bit more capable than i am, so im sure they can handle this. also, they get paid to make ideas implementable, i'm just trying to help with the brain storming."
5/23/2011,"t'raq, i think you are missing my point. mental math gymnastics aside, my point was why go through all the trouble to introduce a new product to the market, which will destabilize the current demand of whatever materials it ends up being created from, when they problem you are trying to be solved can be solved much more elegantly by the pos solution? (and without the side effects of harming high sec cloakers?)"
5/23/2011,cloaks were introduced in 2004. people have been whining about them since.
5/23/2011,there are several possible solutions. i am just writing them down as i think of them.
5/23/2011,"prior to ejection, ship's computer shuts down all modules and diverts the surplus energy to reactor's core. ship enters reinforced mode, hull gets 98% resistance to make sure that pilot leaves ship safely. then the core shuts down. a full ship restart will be needed.i.e. those in pods can claim ships after combat. the person who ejected the ship can not step right back into the ship and neither can his allies. further more, you cannot destroy the ship while it is being overloaded. so if you rapidly leave combat, one alpha strike won't ruin the trophies.you also get a kill mail, stating that pilot abandoned the ship due to cowardice making it a trophy for the involved parties."
5/23/2011,not supported.game needs scrambled eggs.
5/23/2011,not supported.pods need to die and killboards need to show implant losses.
5/23/2011,"since they were now implemented, can we please have the bpc icons the same color as the bpo's but have a black top right or bottom right corner dark with a white ""c"" in it to as opposed to the ones we have now? they are very very much an eyesore, makes my eyes hurt when im looking at a hangar full of them. either that or a yellow c similar to the t2 bpc's please? ps i dont want to seem like an ungrateful prick but those new bpc icons are very annoying."
5/23/2011,"tl'dr: buff the yield, nerf the range, remove from mission, and add it to the lp store! make a meta 8 useful. after all, short range, and doing a lot of stuff, is the way gallente roll, right? original threadits easy, make range 2km, increase mining yield to 85m3."
5/23/2011,i've got 500 of these things lying around... definitely buff them.
5/23/2011,supporting my own.
5/23/2011,similar to the other post...but yes. this info is needed.
5/23/2011,please please let this have been discussed.
5/23/2011,@salpun: i don't know what their plans are with regards the questions or forums.@sekket: we had a full session on pos misery; the dead horse thread was obviously a part of that.
5/23/2011,"transparency 0 - ccp 1what is the point of the minutes if everything important that is discussed is all under an nda? just like real world politics, the politicians that are elected can't tell their voters what they want and need to hear."
5/23/2011,"nice blog.well, except for the nda parts.wasn't the point of the csm that the players could have more insight into what the gravy ccp was doing?if so, i would consider it a failure d: (previous csm meetings aren't exactly mind-boggling)"
5/23/2011,"players should not receive an insurance payout for a ship they have lost in 0.0. the current insurance mechanic makes no sense to me. this has probably been discussed before, but i have yet to see it. remove insurance payments for ships lost out in 0.0 and pvp will become a much larger isk sink. it would also make the destruction from battles have more actual impact. to me, it just seems like a good change overall. does anyone disagree? i would like to hear your arguments."

5/24/2011,black ops are fine as they are. if i could have 2 wishes it'd be....+15-20% jump range-10-15% jump fuel usewhether you bridge bombers/recons/t3s around or go in and hotdrop with the bobs both of these would be greatly welcomed. all while keeping them balanced from becoming fotm solo gankers.list of black ops no'sno covops cloakno tank boostno dps boostwhen utilized correctly they are quite effective. turning them into some idealized pwnmobile will only lead to a massive nerf/rebalance no one flying black ops wants to see.
5/24/2011,"ccp added them pre-nerfed and acknowledge this.as a prolific lover of cloaks, and someone who believes that they are much too available today, the bobs need covops cloaks. in fact, i am willing to deny your intelligence because you do not believe this, while covering my ears and making childish noises.in all seriousness, all ""bobs are fine"" arguments aref actually invalid as ccp admitted they added them pre-nerfed, so screw off."
5/24/2011,will respond to the other posts later but i just wanted to say pre-nerfed =/= underpowered. also can you link this quote please.
5/24/2011,"i agree with gypsio's post earlier that all t2 bcs could use some nerfing, and i actually think the lock range nerf would go a long way towards satisfying both issues. the other issue is that rigs already exist for doing basically what your mod does, and they actually do the job fine. edit: actually, it has to be said that a range nerf of some sort would go a long way towards making the ""dedicated"" long range missile spewers (e.g. caracal, cerberus) fit into their role better.ah i should've gone into better detail here - what i meant was there are ships that use heavy missiles that are far more pressed for mid slots than the drake is. drakes can mount a decent tank with 3 slots, but something like a caracal, cerberus or raven would run into real problems if they were forced to fit more midslot mods on top of everything else. agreed, and i would like to extend apologies for getting so heated on this issue."
5/24/2011,"titan proliferation, and later jfs, killed nullsec difficulty in this regard.does anyone else here even remember when there were freighter convoys, that would be escorted by 50+ ships 40+ jumps past torrinos?"
5/24/2011,"yes. the inability to do that at a high enough volume to keep up with demand in null is why we have all these things that make it easier to move stuff. and even then, you used to have to pod kill yourself to go buy another ship and make the trek back out to null because there weren't markets in null. i don't remember those events with fondness. so, to those who think getting rid of bridges, jumping, and jump bridges will localize the markets in null, they clearly don't remember back to the days before those existed... and the markets pretty much didn't exist."
5/24/2011,"as a whole there are good solutions to the majority of problems posed in this thread:we need more slots ---> let us build more stationsthere aren't enough low end mins in 0.0 --> re-balance the high end ores so that they drop more low end mineralshowever the issue of farms and fields to burn seems to be a problem. i see the farms and fields at issue as asteroid belts and moon mining. but how to burn them? my first idea for asteroid belts was to allow you to destroy the asteroids themselves (each shot destroys some of the ore until all of it is gone), however this only hurts the miners and not the ratters. which is when i came up with the second idea which i think will be more fun. get rid of all static belts in conquerable 0.0instead of static belts there should be something capable of anchoring grav belts in space. (this would also require the addition of ice grav sites) once anchored the the belts would become scan-able with the system scanner and begin to slowly decline in quality. in addition, the local rats would start stopping by to check out the belt. however, the anchor needs to be destroyable by a small gang and once destroyed the sov holders would then have 24-48 hrs(would need balancing) to come back and re-anchor the belt, otherwise it de-spawns and they would have to wait for another grav site to spawn. also, the rats should have a small probability of attacking the anchors so that, if left unattended, the space would gradually return to the default of having no belts.ihub upgrades would increase the probability of grav sites spawning and each anchor would decrease the probability, causing the system to reach an equilibrium over time. this equilibrium should take weeks or even months to reach so that eliminating the belts causes long term pain to the inhabitants. this would give a small gang the ability to at least be highly annoying to the inhabitants of the system and possibly destroy the mining quality of a system. as for moon mining, the ability of a gang to mess with a moon mining pos should depend on how much the miner is willing to put towards defending the tower. a deathstar moon miner should take a fleet large enough that they might as well just destroy the pos. however an un-defended pos should be able to be messed with by a single player. the closest thing i can think of to match these requirements would be a structure that you anchor next to a pos which would stop the moon miner from operating until it is destroyed. however the act of anchoring this structure would be taken as an act of aggression by the pos which would immediately start trying to destroy it and the fleet doing the anchoring. thus if you don't incapacitate the guns then they would destroy the structure soon after your fleet warps off. so, depending on the defenses of the moon mining pos the act of interfering with its operation depends on the relative strengths of your gang and the pos in question. oh.. and let us build stargates"
5/24/2011,i remember bestower flotillas supplying the original fountain alliance.
5/24/2011,"you are right, back then it really did suck. the outcry was intense, and things were changed. these days, i think the manufacturing and trade base is much more robust, and could survive the changes ""back"" to the old system. major alliances already have their own market set up...or they should."
5/24/2011,"dividing some roles in separate tiers like senior and junior posguy/production/contractguy where the lower tiers can not access the higher tier's work should do the trick. also being able to divide the corp in several branches (dividing stations, pos, assets, access) where roles on the same tier can't access the work of those in other branches, would also help big corporations. a thief/saboteur would then only be able to affect a single branch of the corporation."
5/24/2011,"just so that people realise what they're asking for here:this isn't going to happen until ccp reworks an enormous amount of stuff and completely replaces the existing system. i don't think it would be an exaggeration to suggest that this proposal would require an entire expansion's worth of technical work, possibly more.at present, all corp roles, gm roles and dev roles for each character are stored as individual bits in a single 64-bit variable (or some other fairly limited length). there is not a lot of room to manoeuver, and this affects nearly every part of eve in some way, including many areas of code that haven't been touched for several years, such as the pos code. it all just about works for the time being, although many people are unhappy with various aspects of it, and there's every chance that lots of things will break if any attempt is made to change it, just like the ui.consider the last time sovreignty was overhauled. ccp did not create any additional roles relating to tcus or sbus, even though using them is a crucial part of the new system, which should really be separate from everything else. instead, they re-used the existing role of station manager, which also allows corp members to fiddle around with refinery taxes and docking fees at corp outposts. to me, this indicates just how much they wanted to avoid having to mess around with these systems.that said, they're going to find it hard to add more features at some point without adding more roles to control them, so i suppose this will eventually become a priority. supported."
5/24/2011,up to the top! support if you would like to see a thriving contracts market!
5/24/2011,"like most that have chimed in, i can see removing agent standings from the public record, but corp and faction standings?i'm sorry, but this is a game breaker for me. if this isn't fixed, i don't see much point of continuing to try to do anything but grind like it's a single player game in an npc corp... it breaks corp security, breaks rp, and breaks one of the biggest aspects of this game that i felt made it more worthy of playing than any of the other mmos i have to pick from.ccp already drove me off once and if i leave this time, i won't be giving them a third chance to break the game on me. really, this is the sort of major change that should be discussed with the players and not just slapped on them out of the blue. this is the type of change that many of us players take as a big f-u to customer loyalty."
5/24/2011,"some more thought should go into tweaking display of standings. factions are not many, so they should be visible always. maybe there could be button to query corp and agent standings?"
5/24/2011,"perhaps the reason it was imposed so suddenly is because it was an emergency decree by team lag? (or whatever the team at ccp that combats lag is.) i can see that many lookups for those hardcore veteran carebears who have hundreds of agents killing the servers with lookup reqs. to fix the load they take it completely out for now (with the intention of either paralellizing the standings db or adding them back minus agent standings later) and are watching now and laughing at us foam and fret and get our panties in a bunch. then once the fix for the load on the server is ready they will put it back in, with much pomp and circumstance, all in the name of ""listening to our player base"".watch and see."
5/24/2011,yes because you look like bruce
5/24/2011,"i really think it was a mistake making a weapon system for both caldari and gallente who have completely different ship tactics and philosophies. as a result you have a weapon system that works on two extremes, high damage but really short range, weak damage and very long range. there is no middle ground alternate, its either one or the other for both races. i propose we do away with this whole hybrid system. erase the skills and reimburse the skillpoints.amarr and minmatar have their own weapon systems why don't gallente and caldari? they have lower end shared weapon systems like missiles and drones. not to mention they both have to share weapon systems that fit poorly for them. hybrids should become split into two groups:1. particle accelerators - gallente2. rail gun - caldarifor gallente particle accelerators would have a long and short range type1. long range - linear particle accelerator - new type of weapon.2. short range - cyclic particle accelerator - similar to current blasters.particle accelerators uses ammunition that generates a very high amount of thermal damage and a minor amount of kinetic.i have more to come."
5/24/2011,troll or just moron?
5/24/2011,"does it matter? unless she pulls some amazing idea out of her ass and has done a lot of work to get all the little details to fit together perfectly, her idea isn't going to go anywhere."
5/24/2011,"i don't understand why the op was called a troll. maybe that's just me. maybe i have a weird thing for 'tolerance.'the idea presented by the op doesn't have to be the one that ccp adopts, it just has to fit into the current discussion of hybrid weapon systems, which it does. as i understand it, ccp wants to hear what you think, and if this is the way the op expresses what he/she thinks, how can we argue with that?as i read the op, it says; hybrid weapons are broken from the perspective of both narrative and performance, and should be re-thought from the ground up. i support that.here are a few quotes from other posters on the subject of hybrid weapons, and such, from the thread:"
5/24/2011,"interesting idea, but needs more work."
5/24/2011,as mag's said many times... cloaking in system is a counter to all encompassing local chat. let's see local removed from 0.0... no more afk cloakers.let's have a pos module that gives the ability of local to 0.0. now that would be fun....
5/24/2011,decent idea.
5/24/2011,anyone not paying attention should die in 0.0 (my problem is cloakers can not pay attention and be pretty much as safe as if they were docked and never experiance unexpected pvp)i was just saying a tactic used.
5/24/2011,"cloaking is not required to subvert local, since you can simply get in an unscannable ship and fly to a safe.the question of whether local should be changed may be related to this proposal, but i think that's a question that can be discussed in its own thread(s)."
5/24/2011,"i know it may be hard for you to keep up, what with all the threads and using of alts, but i'll explain.this thread is called 'afk cloaking solutions' and as such that's what i am talking about.could someone afk unprobeable? sure. does this still require local to work? yes.is the point the same? why yes, yes it is.now that you've proven local is the root cause, i'll eagerly wait an alt reply."
5/24/2011,stop being so scared of something that is harmless to you. you are an embarrassment to this game.
5/24/2011,"if you want to ""subvert local"" then be at the keyboard to do it. i don't give a **** that someone wants to be in 0.0 scaring the locals and killing off easy prey. but be at the keyboard paying attention. or die just like an inattentive miner or ratter would die for not paying attention.afk cloakers should not be exempt from one of eve's primary rules: pay attention or die.i don't really care that you think that this would be unfair to your poor afk cloaker. inattentive and afk cloakers should become easy prey for the rest of 0.0, just like defenseless and inattentive miners and ratters are easy prey.hey, i know you don't want to lose this tremendous perk of being able to stay logged in ""subverting local"" while you can go to school or to work. hell, you're going to cry and scream when ccp fixes this. you'll probably even quit the game squealing like a pig. but, the fact that you can do this is simply wrong and you know it."
5/24/2011,"yeap. and the only time a nuclear reactor harms you is when they meltdown in your city. by that reasoning, we are going to build all nuclear plants on your backyard. no harm. they are safe. feeling uneasy? why?"
5/24/2011,i support this
5/24/2011,"i support any fair solution to any afk-something. cloaker or not, included."
5/24/2011,"all they do is sit all day long risking absolutely nothing!!! deciding on when the cards are stacked in their favor then striking. not only is this unfair but uncalled for.they are impossible to counter. you can't give me a ship setup that can fight one of these losers where i can still do an anomaly at a decent speed.my idea would be that even at best skills, they can't target anyone for 30 seconds after decloaking. also they drop to zero speed. this would be more balanced. also the cloak cycles for 60 seconds like the damage control. then if you don't hit the cloak button again within 5 seconds, you decloak. time to be able to recloak should be about 2-3 minutes.but in the end i fully support this broken mechanic getting fixed!"
5/24/2011,"i can see you're upset, but swearing and shouting isn't going to help. try to stay calm and understand the issue. being afk is direct response to local. but they are paying for their account, so whatever they do at their own keyboard is not your concern. they are not breaking any rules, even ones that are made up.i've never afk cloaked, although i use my scout to sit for hours watching a gate. some have accuse me of doing so, even though i don't actually leave the keyboard.so where do you draw the line?so far every 'solution' looking to nerf cloaking, always hits active cloaking and many ideas promote the use of macros. this is bad and simply points to the fact, they are not addressing the real issue, which is local.i know you don't like the thought of losing your all seeing eye, but you know you are wrong and you don't want to admit it. while ever local remains as a 100%, risk free, instant intel tool, people will try and subvert it's use. you'll just have to realise that the instant intel it's giving you, can't be taken at face value. now your take on eve rules. many of eve's functions work whilst you are afk, but thanks for your humorous insight into the 'rule book'."
5/24/2011,not only do you want a free warning from local there is a hostile there...you also want an overpowered system wide uncloaking device? go back to highsec so concord can hold your hand and make you feel safer. not supported in any form. remove local!
5/24/2011,"they aren't at the keyboard! thats the point. your ""special"" aren't you.and the only effect most of these suggestions would have on an active cloaker would be to cause them to have to warp to a safe spot very occasionally to recloak. nearly every player that posts a new topic about this subject in fact clearly states that they want to avoid as much effect on active players as possible. further, if ccp were to avoid creating any mechanic that could possibly be done by a macro there would not be a game because nearly ever aspect of this game could be run by a macro. that is just a sad excuse for an argument against something that you are terrified to see change. also, i think its really amusing that you can't comprehend that i am not the only one who takes issue with this flawed mechanic and keep saying that i am posting with a bunch of alts."
5/24/2011,"you cannot say for sure if they are or not, either way it's up to them what they do. as for being special, it's 'you're', not 'your'. i see you've moved on to personal attacks, that's always a good move and suggests a winning argument.exactly, meaning it affects active cloaking and not in a good way. thanks for agreeing.but fail, as you've agreed.not a sad excuse at all, simply a fact. much like the fact, you hate the thought of losing your all seeing eye.i'm amused that you're not the only one, failing to understand why people afk cloak. you and the others, can't seem to comprehend that local is at the root of all this.also, please quote the posts where i keep saying, that you are posting with alts."
5/24/2011,"since you insist on being insulting for no particular reason, your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries. now that the requisite return insult has been levied, i'll say again that changing local is not what this proposal is about. if you want it removed then create a proposal to that effect. i understand that you think the current game is too safe for non-cloakers, and others like myself think it's too safe for cloakers.it sounds like you are neither willing to be convinced nor do you have any arguments meant to change people's minds, you just want to insult people who disagree with you. in other circumstances i might try to stop you, but since that seems to be the primary activity on these forums i'll simply bid you happy trolling."
5/24/2011,"great film that.no i think the balance is about right atm. but this proposal is in regards to afk cloaking, that cannot have it's desired effect without local. you could afk without a cloak, to get the same results, simply because local is at the root of the issue.nah but faceless alts tend to illicit certain responses. if you're not a faceless alt, then i apologise for my horrendous 'hard to keep up' taunt."
5/24/2011,yet another thread smelling of afk cloaking whine.
5/24/2011,"i sense a hunt for afk cloakers is more of the subject here than actually changing the module concept. prove to me that people are afk cloakers and i'll give you a reward or something, but i doubt you can prove that's the case.if you can't handle the dangers in 0.0, move to safe empire space"
5/24/2011,haven't you moved to high sec yet? all your whine will produce nothing to deny people of hunting other people in space where there is no rules of engagement. 0.0 is not safe empire space
5/24/2011,"please prove that people are afk on your little carebear system. accusing people of being afk is just a silly excuse of you not being able to handle the fact that there is someone in your system, with the intentions to blow your ship up. and their presence is as justified as yours. one universe, one server = mmorpgmaybe you should try out singularity instead?"
5/24/2011,"if you cannot manage to counter you have failed at everything 0.0 is all about, and you would probably be better off in safe empire space, atleast it would save you some buckets of tears.the only broke thing is people that have no clue of how to operate themselves due to the fact that 0.0 is a hostile and dangerous playground."
5/24/2011,the sp/hour rate would be based on your lowest two attributes. i think it's a good idea.
5/24/2011,"or you could just implement a way to change skills through eve gate. access to internet is so common these days, that if you can't get access to it for a long period of time, you aren't really trying."
5/24/2011,"this, tho replace ""grouped"" with focus fire"
5/24/2011,"the whole damage notification thing needs to be improved, it is very difficult to tell who is hurting you for what when a lot of things are hitting you.it would be nice if it showed like 3 at a time, and scrolled."
5/24/2011,"i'm saying that cloaking has no counter. the ""all seeing eye"" and afk cloaking make this apparent. there should be enough risk involved in cloaking in someone elses system to make it too dangerous to walk away from the computer for hours on end."
5/24/2011,server should auto-logoff a cloaked ship after 1 or 2 hour afk.macro activities (chat spam every x seconds for example) to stay online should be punished.
5/24/2011,"no what is apparent, is that local is at the root of all this. you can afk in an unprobable ship, that kind of messes with your take on things now doesn't it.local has no counter, that's why people have taken to using afking, to try and subvert it's use."
5/24/2011,just because you do not now how to kill them does not mean it can not be done. btw botters go against the eula. someone hunting you does not. go to highsec if your scared.
5/24/2011,"+1 post for good thread posting oh and btw, why is there never any whine about regular ships being flown by people in the crying carebears systems? isn't that a threat too? going on the assualt of a covert class of ships is nothing but pathetic attempts t"
5/24/2011,yes i would argue that someone who is sitting at their keyboard is not afk. also i was saying bombers are the only ship that can instapoint after decloaking.
5/24/2011,"here is more problems then soplutions cap its drain can be manget firth macro to clouck them again, and stil sti in system."
5/24/2011,"how about an interedictor. do you think they could keep you from warping right after decloaking? could probably lock down an entire gang thats mining and would be able to hold them long enough for a gang to jump into system, probably even make it 2-3 jumps while the barges/industrials try to slow boat out and then align. even if there is security that popped the interdictor he wouldn't have dropped a bubble unless his friends could take the security."
5/24/2011,"i would like to know how you manage to login after downtime and still stay away from your computer for days. you also know about the locking penealty on cloaked ships after decloaking (excluding bombers) right?seriously? your arguing that they aren't afk because they log on and click the cloak button, that takes about 3 min and can easily be done with a macro.also, you do know bombers can fit cynos right.yes i would argue that someone who is sitting at their keyboard is not afk. also i was saying bombers are the only ship that can instapoint after decloaking.how about an interedictor. do you think they could keep you from warping right after decloaking? could probably lock down an entire gang thats mining and would be able to hold them long enough for a gang to jump into system, probably even make it 2-3 jumps while the barges/industrials try to slow boat out and then align. even if there is security that popped the interdictor he wouldn't have dropped a bubble unless his friends could take the security.how does the interdictor get into system and warp to the belt without being detected?"
5/24/2011,"because people are mining afk. but really, in the years that i've been part of null sec mining ops, i've never seen a mining op go down in this way. almost always it is a logoff cyno. person jumps into system, everyone hides, person finds the belt everyone was mining in, logs off. wait 30 minutes for people to go back to mining, log in, light cyno, bridge in fleet, everything dies. in almost every case where the mining op fails, that's how it went down."
5/24/2011,"i strongly support this, the nerf to scan resolution is lame, a dread's role is not only anti-structure but anti-capital as well. being limited to locking only 2 targets and taking forever to lock them makes it useless for target switching and fcing. a group of carriers simply repair their targets long before the dread finishes locking on it. i really see no point in making locking time so long especially since dreads can only lock 2 targets in the first place. the tracking nerf from siege modules was made horrible in dominion. people were whining and crying about how titans can easily own battleships and cruisers with their guns. so ccp nerfed the tracking to xl guns so that titans became useless again. they forgot change the penalties on siege in responses to the nerf made to tracking in dominion. as a result a nyx can make me miss by simply moving or i miss a pos because my velocity is greater than zero when i activated siege mode. i agree that the 10 minute timer of a siege module is too long. people say that dreads must commit to a fight, what about supercarrier? it doesn't have to commit to a fight while packing superior dps, ehp, and usage. the only thing that dreads are useful nowadays is in wormholes, even then their use is still limited. they pose virtually no threat to sub caps unlike a carrier. this is the step in the right direction!"
5/24/2011,"yes a supercap can speedtank a dread, if it orbits the dread at 500m, which is kinda impossible in any kind of realistic situation.also i am pretty sure titans still do huge damage to battleships (except lol leviathan). you meanwhile want a 25-30% reduction in tracking, now a reduction in tracking to 20-25% i could support, but not a reduction of 25-30%, then you simply get dreads owning battleships which are both owned by supercaps (really tracking there isnt the issue why they get slaughtered by supers). tbh the issue is supercaps, not dreads."
5/24/2011,this is a serious problem
5/24/2011,"wrong, a supercap can be 15km away moving and the dread will still have issues hitting it. a dread will miss a pos if it goes into siege mode moving at 10 m/s at 30km. a battleships moving 100m/s at 40 km can speedtank a dread's short range guns with 2 tracking computers with tracking scripts. i doubt decreasing the penalties from 50% to 20-25% will make dreads anti-bs ships. maybe from a long range, but realistically bs's can simple orbit the dread at 30km without prop mods to make it miss. besides if one is staying still in a bs while engaging a dread, its their fault that they get popped with it finishes locking and shots you."
5/24/2011,"sorry to dissapoint you but i've actually had a 18k volley shot at a bs with a turret dread in siege, the poor bs basically died horribly and i loved it!of course i would endorse less penalties thou"

5/24/2011,"i shouldn't try coming up with ideas that late at night. after thinking about it a little bit during school i have realized that it is impractical to consider that idea and that it would be a bad idea to bring in another series to eve. however, my proposal is that some new playable races are added with all new ships and that they would be more alian than human. they would be completely ccp designed. any suggestions on what these races could be is welcome."
5/24/2011,"not sure if serious, but i'm sure the uss lawsuit should be added to your fleet of ships coming to eve, if this brain fart would ever see the light of day.from a practical standpoint this would never happen even if ccp could buy the rights to do it. there really isn't any benefit in doing it. you personally might like it, but other players would hate it, it would cost ccp money and give outsiders influence on what ccp can or cannot do with content in their own game. it's a much better option to make up your own things, since it allows you to retain total control over it and you don't have to pay anyone for the right to use it."

5/24/2011,"while i'd love an eve like game that is set in the stargate universe, there is no way that we'll get anything stargate related in eve aside maybe from some vague reference and inside-joke ala the black monolith. eve is a completely different universe with completely different storyline. yes it's sad the tv series have ended, but if you're looking to ressurect stargate you'll need to do it a different way."

5/24/2011,with our saved ship fits we can auto fit our ships with the click of a button. i would like to see a feature where we can pull up a saved fit and click purchase and automaticly buys from the market the ship and all the mods required to make that fit from the current station at the lowest price. i know its not a game fixing/breaking idea but it would save soo much time shopping in jita :)

5/25/2011,"0.0 should be about building a empire. being self sufficient. you need industrials to mine to produce and mission/anomaly runners for meta stuff.it doesnt work because you have low end minerals in abundance in high sec in complete safety which is probably mostly mined by bots or afk miners. also high sec has better rafineries, no taxes in 1 man corp and an abundance of manufacturing slots. a 0.0 miner can't compete with that so he only mines abc ores anything else is pointless! mierals coming from drone regions in loot form also destroy mining as a profession. mining should be a necessity not a ""lol"" profession.the jita dependance of 0.0 is stupid in so many ways. there shouldnt be convoys between 0.0 and jita but only between the places of mining, manufacturing and trade in 0.0.people earning from pve pew pew stuff should be able to make their living in 0.0 without going to high sec to farm lvl4s. in my opinion industry/mining should pay more than farming anomalies/missions this is also one of the problems that destroyed the industry and why convoys dont happen. i can't pay the pvp people to escort me cos they earn so much more just running the anomalies so why should they bother. also why bother mining when my tengu earns 50mil/hour.low sec/npc 0.0 space pirates/mercs should suffer from the lack of their industry and our industry is the fields they can burn.ccp recepie seems to make 0.0 into a wild west (which is reserved for low sec/npc 0.0) and just leave the high sec bears fat and happy.destroy high sec! high sec must be a training ground not a lvl4 farming field, industry and trade haven! there is no incentive to do any of this in 0.0. when you make the incentive to live in 0.0 then for all i care you can burn all the jump bridges, jump freighters or anything with a jump drive because we won't need it. now this would be a sandbox not a lol 90% of game is high sec."
5/25/2011,by destroying high sec i meant to remove lvl4 (even lvl3) missions from it and deplete the asteroid fields completly and no matter how much safer high sec would be lvl2 missions wouldnt be appealing anymore.it would remove high sec mining bots and afk mining. it would make mining fun in 0.0 cos your tritanium wouldn't get you 5mil/h but 50mil/h.problem is this would be a realy big change and after cattering for the cearbear hearth for too long they might not adapt to this change and would simply leave.this is why i know ccp will never change and mature this game and it's always gonna be a joke.
5/25/2011,"there are a lot of grand proposals here and as a game design major i find it great that the community would go through all the trouble of taking a role in trying to help fix them. that being said i'm not sure the repercussions of these ideas are often times thought out to through the entire scope of this universe. this game has an advertisement about the butterfly effect and what some of these suggestions would accomplish would be negated by the problems they would cause. that being said what are the problems? null sec is barren of industry on a large scale when compared to high sec.yet when you talk to most industrialist they get all dreamy eyed over the thought of one day managing their own outpost or grazing in fields of abc. so why is it that even though most industrialist want a slice of this variable heaven that they stay holed up in highsec, which, contrary to popular thought, is not profitable unless you already have a sizable investment, perfect skills and usually multiple accounts?the answer to that question is many fold but it has everything to do with what a friend of mine and i call the african complex. null sec is currently this vast area of the richest space in eve waiting to be harnessed by anyone who knows how. unfortunately, like africa, its run by warlords and their goons. in order to become a part of the null sec team you have to enslave yourself to a larger pvp alliance that will most likely not even protect you if a single neut comes in system looking for an easy kill. my null sec experience with indy amounted to a bunch of us indy guys tied up in station with one or two neuts outside and the entire protective fleet 2 jumps away unwilling to tackle such a small fry. along with the african complex comes something that normally doesnt get brought up. behind most pvp corps there is an alt industry corp that gets fed through the pvp. while this isnt a revelation among players already living in 0.0 i can state with some confidence that if most industrialist were told before entering in the game that their spot and their hard work was mimicked by an alt that never left station and was only played a minute fraction of what they put in that those players would have never chosen that route.while that is why you're never going to see a miner in system there are other problems too that should be addressed. my entire friends list stopped using pi when they made it variable. the mini game moves resources outside of reach for entire months and is no longer fun for an indy. choas is fun for pvp but when it comes to creation, enough problems arise without the game taking its toll with rng. another factor of pi hell is the the amount required to build anything in a null sec system is near impossible between running pos and not being able to get new command centers on demand.logistics was brought up multiple times in this thread and i was wondering how many of those people have ever tried to run a system? characters not logging on or unwilling to mine ice some weeks can cripple an entire system without the jump freighter lines. while the problem of ore compression is a massive one another nerf to jumping would harm rather then encourage growth not to mention setting up a new outpost in deep null would become unimaginable.before i will post a review on the changes i would make in vague terms i would like to bring up one last thing. if you really wanted to tip the scales for an indy character making up his mind on whether or not null is right for him there is one massive incentive you can give to players. bring back the chance to obtain a t2 bpo by doing a industry in 0.0. even if it takes 2 years to obtain a frig bpo i can assure you it will peak interest."
5/25/2011,tl;dr- pvpers has a greater capacity compared to industrialist in terms of mineral and wealth gain- a pvper can mimic anything an industrialist does with his stationed alt- planetary interaction is not player driven and is too unstable to support infrastructure growth when isolated from the jita market- jump freighters are required for any sustainability due to players having time conflicts.- incentives other then you get to build for pvpers must be put into null.

5/25/2011,"the new and long awaited feature of incarna is finally about to drip, drip its way onto tq, and into a pr disaster.under the current plan, cq, the first stage of incarna will not be optional.every time you dock you will no-longer be in your hanger looking at your ship,you will instead load your captains quarters as a fully dressed and pressed avatar.there are posts and threads abounding with people detailing why this is bad.here i simply want to get a head count for those who, for whatever reason, believe that cq should be optional, upon docking.this is not a referendum on if it should exist at all, or if it will be any good... ect.simply a show of hands for those who want to chose when, if at all, they use it.hopefully if there is enough support it can be made optional before it hits tq, not tacked on 6~18 month later.given that those who want to use cq will under this proposal still be able to do so, without any penalties. it seems to be a no-brainer that those who don't want to use it all the time also have that choice.soden rahedit: ok so ccp have added (on the sisi test build) an option to not load the cq environment.this is good, but not what i was asking for, this helps those who have performance issues with the in station environment, not those who had rp/immersion issues. please keep supporting for having a regular hanger view on docking (ship spinning and all) with a neocom button to enable us to disembark to enter cq when we want."
5/25/2011,check out the new dev blog. all the station buttons will still be available. if you dont hit your arrow keys u wont even have to deal with it. im logging into my fb now to pull the dev blog for you.
5/25/2011,"incarna dev blogas you will notice with the imbedded video all station buttons are still available to use and make for quick item/ship swapping etc.if the duality server says anything, which i doubt it does, having all ur settings on low and unchecked the textures for cq dont even load. i wouldnt count on this however.are you worried about cpu reqs? my laptop cant even handle incarna in its current state so i doubt i will be using it either. either way, its circumventable."
5/25/2011,^^this.
5/25/2011,"read the blogs, been on duality, chatted to the devs on duality, read the forum posts, posted some of the forum posts. and still for a whole host of reasons think this should be optional... know a lot of others feel the same, so created this thread.now please stop assuming you know more about what's going on than me and that i have reached my opinion based on incomplete or inaccurate information.i like the idea of cq, i just want it to be optional.if it is optional, then it hurts those who like/want it not at all.if it isn't optional then it ****es off those that don't want it or don't want it all the time.why not make it optional."
5/25/2011,"but im asking why bother making an option if it doesnt matter? im not inferring i know more then you, im simply pointing out a reason of 'who cares?'.chill out guy, maybe you can start listing your (and the millions of other peoples) reasons for why its such a big deal to make it optional when the idea of incarna is to make the eve universe more realistic.i just dont see why a step towards an immersive environment is so bad when you can still function like before.sorry for not seeing your 'superior wisdom'.hows that for for an ignorant post? better?"
5/25/2011,"i got stuck within five minutes of testing on duality last week and still am. sure, i dared to hit the ""leave station"" button after my cq view went dark and non-responsive, but still. if you add another layer to something already very complex, don't expect either to run as smooth as it would by itself. there will be problems.it is a fact that many players are unhappy and skeptical of incarna, and even more about the apparent removal of a choice to leave your pod or not. hell, i'm pretty awed by incarna myself and will probably not stay outside of stations any longer than i need to, yet i am totally flabberghasted by this appartent inconsideration.there are a lot of good reasons to keep incarna optional.there is not a single good one not to.alternatively: make us see the light, ccp and respond to this with stunning wisdom.edit in answer to above:because it is not more realistic to just stand there in your clothes seconds after your ship started to dock?because it is not more immersive to be forced to get out of your ship/pod just to convo with an agent/drop off some small cargo/refit/hide in the station, ready to undock at the first chance to get elsewhere safely?"
5/25/2011,"well there is plenty things in this game changed what lots of us do like and others not.the game evolve and will continue to evolve in the future, so you have only 2 options;a) accept itb) or leave it.there is also plenty of those guys who whine about they poor laptops cant run this/cant run that.well did those who complain even ever read what syster requirment eve need to run?stop crying this game is already hold it back witt grafic's and such to try everyone be happy but ccp simply cant to not move forward with rest of the world or they simply will ruin they own business.if you want to play this game for long period of time you have to accept the changes and you have to upgrade your systems at some period of time, thats atleast what you do when you buy other games, dont you?"
5/25/2011,"no, i just deal with using low graphic settings. do i win?"
5/25/2011,"@cyber:if that's your opinion, wtf are you doing in the assembly hall? if you believe that everything is out of our hands and rightly so, this makes no sense at all!"
5/25/2011,"i am not claiming 'superior wisdom'. i was objecting to you dissing my post on the assumption i hadn't read the dev blog or tested out the feature on duality.and i am all for a more immersive environment. this won't help.not because the feature itself is bad, but because it makes no sense that when you dock you instantly appear fully clothed and without any pod goo in your hair in your captains quarters.if you dock up for a quick ammo reload or to switch out hardeners, you wouldn't get out your pod, shower, put some clean clothes on, then switch your hardeners out, by push button now your no-longer in your pod, then undress, get back in your pod, get back in your ship and go.there are many reasons for wanting an option to enter cq rather than it being mandatory, but i didn't create this thread to discuss them, there are a host of threads on the forums already doing that. this thread was created simply for a show of hands for those who want it to be optional, and wish the csm and ccp to take that into consideration. if you want to debate the reasons why i can point you in the direction of several threads where it is being actively argued. but i can end with one. there are a number (i never said millions) of people who vocally don't want incarna at all, and/or want it to be optional.given making it optional doesn't hurt those that do want it or don't care why give yourself (as ccp) the agro of annoying those who want the option.this issue has been raised in every thread on the new cq feature."
5/25/2011,"this is the future. people are warping instantly all over the place. whos to say there isnt a transportation beam that takes you out of the pod, and this beam also cleans you, the clothing is threaded over you or transported on you, all in the matter of a moment.and im not 'dissing' your thread. you made a public thread and i responded in it. my initial post had no 'disses' in it, 'yo'. i 'aint dissin yo **** bra'.however, since your a ****, now i am ****ing with you.if you are so ****ed about incarna making your day so much more difficult by doing the same thing that happened before but with a different look then you got more problems then just incarna coming out.they are pandering to you guys who are mad that you have a spaceman doll by keeping all the functional buttons and windows intact. just ignore the ****ing guy in the middle of the screen and theres no issues.your making it an issue by saying ""i am upset that the dock screen looks different now."" that's just ridiculous."
5/25/2011,"come into my thread, by clicking here, and 'diss my **** yo' if it'll make you feel better. its obvious that you need a commotion."
5/25/2011,"well i think that this topic which the devs have looked at (even posted in a dev blog), showed a good way to go.i like the idea of having both the cq, and hangar.makes sense more in an rp way it you look at it as the following:every time you go to you cq you have to drain your pod wash and get dressed, now would you really want to do that if you were only picking up one item?i mean in rl when i'm picking someone up in the car, i don't always pullover and park, turn off the engine, get out greet the person then get back in. so why would i in a space ship?maybe having the hangar as a quick stop, where items can be moved,ships changed, and refitting, and cq for everything else, which would take more time.edit:also want cool little cut scenes, like suggested on video to add more immersion. better than a loading bar."
5/25/2011,"my pc runs the beta version of cq dual screen at full res, max settings, aa the works, at over 30 fps. i am not complaining because i won't be able to run eve on the new settings. ccp are actively asking for opinions of the players as to what they think of eve, and the new features under development in particular.my feedback, includes, the opinion that cq should be optional, for a variety of reasons. i therefore totally reject the premise of your post.those are not the only options, and those are not the reasons i am complaining about this issue.i am not about to emo-rage quit. you can't have my stuff. and i will keep expressing my opinion (that ccp has asked for) on the game i enjoy.you are right on one thing... there are plenty of features liked by some and not by others... this will be one of them... so in the interests of keeping the customer satisfied, why force people to use this one?"
5/25/2011,"can't really say supported. if all the same features are there, and everything takes the same amount of time, why have them complicate matters by having 2 sets of code just for docking. just seems like we are asking for things to be way more complicated for ccp than they need to be.edit: to the op, i guess it would help if you gave a couple reasons why a change like this would be needed at all. it just sounds like extra work and more time in development for basically nothing."
5/25/2011,i really don't.
5/25/2011,i'm just wondering if ship spinning is this important to you?
5/25/2011,"meaby because it will become part of the game they make? as you have stated above, some do like something in game while the others do completely dislike though the others do like what the first one do not so they both have to deal with it.this case will not any difrent, while i will remain netral on this new feauture of they game there will be still lots of ppl who likes it and who not.i'm sure that there is enough some things in game that you totaly would like to be removed, so i do my things, but the true is it wont happence and we ( you/me and others) have to deal with."
5/25/2011,"and you beleave that you can dictate how ccp make they own game? get real. yes they listning to desires of the customers ( atleast if they smart enough to do so) but at the end..... its them who make the final desigion and final content, how they think it should be, not the player base."
5/25/2011,"assuming it was me you were asking...nope, although it does apparently have quite a large following.they are planning (allegedly) to add a ship spinning feature to cq at a later date.but that doesn't bother me one way or another..."
5/25/2011,it is optional. just tell windows not to allow the file that contains the cq textures to load. no cq.
5/25/2011,"well i usually get accused of creating walls of text (of reasoned argument, that no-one replies to). as there already seemed to be quite a large number of people already complaining about this issue i tried to make a thread simply for everyone who cared to put their had up and say yes i agree. this may have been a bit too optimistic on my part.however, the 'everything takes the same time' is not necessarily a given here.and i am not asking for two different kinds of docking, i am suggesting that you dock as normal, and then enter cq after that if you want by clicking a neocom button. this thread might give you a taste of the arguments and this is my first post in it."
5/25/2011,"yeah but i want to be able to use it, just not be forced to use it all the time.plus its possible your suggestion (i have seen your thread) breaks the eula."
5/25/2011,"you don't have to use it each time tho dude ... im not sure what ur not getting here. just because u can walk around you dont have to.its like changing ur desktop background, does that fundamentally change how u use your computer?"
5/25/2011,not supported.
5/25/2011,"so have you decided i am not a whatever the asterisked word was you called me and can now be talked to?it wont make any difference to how i play... as it stands the first iteration the 'new' 3d ui will basically be embedded buttons in the cq environment that open the old ui windows. which then completely cover and hide that environment.until that changes i wont ever see cq under all my windows.i will though waste cpu time loading it.however from an aesthetic and rp standpoint the fact that i no longer in my pod looking at my ship with camera drones jars. plus i like the hanger view, in your analogy of a wallpaper this would be where i'm being forced to have a new wallpaper i don't like instead of one i do.basically ccp is adding on a huge new area of the game, with lots of new coding. which can go wrong and break. if it (as originality advertised) is kept separate, and one breaks it doesn't effect the other. if cq breaks on launch (or after) we can no longer dock.there is an issue for those on baseline hardware who currently use the 'don't load station environment' option. who will now be forced to load a big new environment.basically there are lots of reasons to make cq optional.the only reason not to is 'its challenging for ccp to do'which is manifestly not true... plus i asked, the reason atm is aesthetic.as the only reason is aesthetic and aesthetics are personal... i say make it optional so we can chose which we want.and on your earlier rant, your immediate response was to assume i hadn't read the devblog, and was posting not knowing what was going on. that is dissing my post, or however you want to put it. your starting point was to assume i didn't know what i was talking about. that irritated me, but not to the point of shouting swearing and calling you names. i just wanted this thread to be a head count, no drama at all. if you want to continue discussing this then fine. but call me asterisks again and i'll simply ignore you. i don't need the agro."
5/25/2011,"his orignal post was supporting how its not an issue due to the fact that you can still function the docking like normal. its not his fault that your an idiot.if ur worried about your cpu then thats a diff issue. keep graphic settings low. maybe you should log back into duality and check out all the click boxes pertaining to graphic settings. u can turn most everything to low and no.your just *****ing for the sake of *****ing, typical eve user."
5/25/2011,"i understand that not having any choice is a religious conviction with some people, however for the rest of us an option to stay in the ship when docked would make things right.here's my post from the dev blog thread:just pointing out that this is a big mistake. you guys have been pretty insistent about the immersion-inducing nature of this eve add-on, and this kind of space -> avatar transition is anything but immersive. there is absolutely no reason for the capsuleer to always leave the pod when docked when all the current tasks can be performed remotely from the pod.it is especially sad to see this because all of the graphical assets required for the ship-spinning view are still in the cq client, and the developer resources to keep this view in the game would be minimal. this feature does not even require any changes in the incarna design.so why not keep it? making it optional will make a lot of your customers happy. those who complain about performance, immersion, gameplay focus can opt out of auto-disembarking, while those that can't wait to walk can select to forgo the ship-spin view. a complete win for everyone.and when you do actually add some content to incarna, players will be compelled to exit their ships to experience it, even if that involves upgrading their computers. ^"
5/25/2011,"in 2008's fanfest torfi showed us a playable demo of incarna, it had the normal station view and a button that had you leave your ship.there's no reason we can't have that with cq."
5/25/2011,"idea:i would propose that ccp allow ml and pl levels to influence their respective lvls on the bpc if invention is successful.i couldn't give an exact formula of how much influence they should have, perhaps given a max result it would still be less than a fully researched t2 bpo.as for decryptors, it could be made that only by using a decryptor can you approach or match a bpo thereby maintaining their current value so as not to nerf explorers.reasoning this would still give those with t2 bpo's an advantage since invention would still never be able to match a bpo. also someone w/o a t2 bpo would still need to go through the time and expense of researching a t1 as well as the repeated time and expense of the invention process. it also would not flood the market since you cannot just buy a t1 bpo and repeatedly copy it to get these results. since research would be required, it would become more difficult to simply switch items on a whim. this method would maintain the value of owning a bpo, but would also allow everyone the opportunity to compete reasonably and fairly in the market.i'm not a fan of permanent, unfair advantages in a video game. we are all paying the same 14.99 per month so we should all be playing under the same game-play mechanics (or at least close to the same give this proposal)."
5/25/2011,if you increase the marketable value of invention results you would be decreasing the value of a t2 bpo (excluding it's value as a collectible item)
5/25/2011,"true.... as long as it was less efficient than you can make with a t2 bpo, then the changes to the t2 bpo prices wont crash, and they'll still be very profitable. at the same time, i think providing a platform for competition in game is much better than maintaining the value of legacy, bloated-price, money-printers that are unavailable. personally, i like the idea of improving invention, especially if it boosts the exploration profession and increases market-place competition."
5/25/2011,"the problem: eve is currently in the age of supercapitals. if you have more you win, if you have less you lose, a fleet subcapitals and normal capitals are unable to counter a fleet of supercapitals. on the other hand, many people say: i worked/cheated/scammed hard to get the isk for it so they shouldn't be nerfed. i agree, in combat they should be monsters as they are now. the things i want to change are the cost and logistic background to operate them efficiently.the million dollar question: how to do it?currently a nyx, aeon, etc has a jumprange of 10ly, with good jump skills it takes 6.000 isotopes (900m3) to make this jump. that costs around 3m isk, what is a joke, if you consider the 15-20b isk real price of these ships. let's change this balance a little bit, say a 100 times: a jump of 10ly should cost about 600.000 isotopes (90.000m3) that's about 300m isk. the fuel bay for supers should be around 100.000m3, so after jumping in, the supercapital fleet is stranded, unless you organize proper logistical background with jump-freighters in stand-by for example. the corp hangar should have the same size as now (50.000m3), so it's not making any big difference.effects - pros:- supercapital blobs would not be able to get to the other side of the universe in less then 2 hours, like nowadays- less griefing - killing lonely ratting carriers, etc with a dozens of supercapitals would cost a lot more isk, than the actual isk damage inflicted- in bigger conflicts, they could still be used in large numbers to break sovs, etc since their combat abilities would be the same as now, and usually big alliances have good logistical background. but at least they would only use a single nyx to kill a lonely rifter camping a gate, not 20- fc's should consider cost/effect- if someone choose to deploy a fleet of supers, after jumping in there is no way to get far until refueled, so there could be gfs, without retreating from the pew-pew at the first sign of trouble- would encourage of using supers in smaller scale warfare too, since you don't have to be afraid of deploying your few own scs for being ganked almost instantly by a super-super blob from the other side of the universe- titans could bridge more subcaps because of the greater fuel bay- happy hour for ice-minerscons:- this proposal wouldn't change the combat abilities of scs, but still a lot owner would cry how expensive (300m/10ly) it became to travel in a 15-20b isk ship, but i say if you have the isk to buy one, you should have the isk to pay maintenance fee too."

5/25/2011,"supported in theory.but how do you propose that logistical support would work? unless you allow freighters to directly refill the fuel bay. maybe a special jump freighter that can compress the fuel into a more manageable size and can move it into a fuel bay?what would change for titans and rorquals?a normal freighter would be worthless for the logistical role without a titan, and a titan might need all of the freighters just to move itself. so jump freighters or a new support capital would be needed... or hell, just buff the rorqual/orca for the job. give capindies a combat role."
5/25/2011,"+1 support but need more nerf, like a longer building time, because almost every months build 300 sc in the game, and reach their numbers over 4000.the game went sc online at 0.0 sec."
5/25/2011,"100x is way over the top. 10x is conceivable. scarriers aren't purchased by people who make more isk/hr than other people. scarrier pilots simply saved up isk for a longer period of time. what this would do is further stratify alliances between the alliances that can throw isk around and those who can't. this will have the opposite effect, in that big alliances will use them and it will be even more out of reach for the little guys. it would decrease the amount of hot drops using supers on ratters, but honestly, titan bridge in a couple subcaps with webs/painters add a few dreads and the ratting carrier will die just the same. the only reason people use scarriers to kill ratting carriers is cause that's nearly the only way to get the killmail without the carrier self destructing first."
5/25/2011,interesting proposal but it still would not address how useless dreads are atm. i bring that up because that is part of the supers are too op gripe. i also see your idea creating a bigger gap between the top tier power blocks and those that are not. this might even cause less conflict in 0.0 and more power blocks to turtle up because of the cost to attack. i can imagine another north power block that blues everyone and does not travel. why should they when they are the holders of the only tech moons in the game. it would be too expensive for any other power block to cross the map to attack with a big enough force to break the turtle. i cant support it. anything that causes less conflict is not good to me.
5/25/2011,"maybe 100x is a little too high, but i think the op made a point. supercarriers are purchased by people who have either more isk/hr or more hours and they can save up for fuel costs too. i dont think it will change balance between small and big alliances in a wrong direction, it's already way out of control. in fact by reducing the action radius of supers (fuel and logistical needs), it should encourage smaller factions to deploy the few scs of their own.dropping 10 subcaps or regular capitals on a ratter carriers, instead of 2 scs is a step forward."
5/25/2011,"it's affecting the cost of attacking and defending with supers, for low priority targets subcaps and normal caps could be used again as a viable alternative. great powerblocks have the financial background to move the scs to the frontline, once they have arrived they can be fielded cheaper in the close vincinity (10-15lys). after this change the distance between solar systems in light years would matter. if you already brought your fleet to the target region to break the turtle's armor, it's a real pain in the ass to bring them back home, so it will lead to more deadlier conflicts. retreat won't be a good option."
5/25/2011,defending costs a lot less because your not traveling as far. this promotes everyone not to travel. regular caps even in much larger numbers are not a viable alternative vs super caps which is another advantage to the turtle. no on will want to travel when you could be buying more supers with he cost of moving your fleet to the other side of the map. just my opinion for what it is worth. i'd much rather see dreads get buffed to bridge the gap than your kind of change.
5/25/2011,"i loled hard. that's exactly the reason why this ***gotry is to be nefred somehow. you guys are turning eve into grindfest worst then ever before. not only for youselves, but effectively for the rest of eve since they have somehow to compete with these sc blobs - and the only way to deal with sc blob is a bigger sc blob. 100x looks decent. a bit modest for my taste, but still it will do."
5/25/2011,"that isn't a grindfest, that's just having the patience to wait for something nice, rather than run around in drake blobs. if we want to talk about overpowered ships for the isk drakes, drams, cynas, and machs need a solid beating with the nerf bat. scarriers cost a lot. if they cost a lot to move, they will turn into the wtfpwn of defensive units. then there really wouldn't be a counter to them.up side to this is that pl and drf would be eating a huge nerf bat with this change."
5/25/2011,yeah. go tell me you're saving your pennies to get just a 'nice' ship.

5/25/2011,"interestingly, increasing the logistics costs of moving supers will significantly alter force projection, so i support this. however, i don't think this will solve the sc problem. there are two fundamental problems with sc's: 1.) tackling -- you need a bubbler to hold a sc down. however, the sc has the ability to kill all tacklers quickly and efficiently. its not vulnerable to any ship class. 2.) scalability -- sc's daisychain into groups of unbreakable turtle hives that spew drone waves that wipe out all sub-super fleet types. they break the roshambo of fleet engagements!"
5/25/2011,i could agree with upping the amount of fuel needed to jump. im not informed well enough to make a judgement on the numbers however.
5/25/2011,"just take them all their drones except fighter bombers, problem solved.if that is too much to do, do this instead.p.s:yes that would include fighters as well as wtfsentryswarmsp.p.s: 150m<U+FFFD> normal dronebay might be ok, maybe, but not much more"
5/25/2011,would making fighter/bomber bandwidth separate from drone bandwidth help? i.e. they can launch loads of fighters/bombers but only 5 regular drones?thus with bombers/fighters theoretically balanced to not wtfpwn all the smaller ships they become more balanced?
5/25/2011,"i totally agree. scale is completely wrong in-game, when my nyx shows up i often have to zoom into it in large fleets of non supers because as others have pointed out, there are bs and carriers which are "" almost "" the same size when large ships are gathered in close range....allow me also to point out that tiny ships are allowed to bump what is meant to be a humangous ship!!!!"
5/25/2011,"currently the rifter's design is too small to accommodate the pod. there looks like a bridge where a human pilot would be, but compared side by side the pod would breach the hull of the rifter.all ships need a scale fix"

5/25/2011,fixed.exactly why it's a good thing it's gone.
5/25/2011,"heres an idea/thing to consider...fof's have always been designed to seek out an ""object"" depending on its standing towards you... neutral standings are as good as red on it... yes this is agrivating when u have a ton of static structures yes... and we've heard a few good ways to change that including my own form/flavour.i have found in pve once you're aggress'd and launch drones they will orbit until you're hit by any sort of ewar, be it painters webbers, dampeners, or ecm's... they auto aggro the 1st ship doing so.fof's could work in this fashion... yes some will complain wahh i want it to auto target the falcon! seriously not gonna happen! ccp can port the auto ewar aggro from drones to fof's and would help a lot in pvp without overpowering it i believe.here's another idea... fof's are ment to work independently from the ship hence no locking required. the fof system it was modelled over has only been designed as a 1 missile against 1 ship scenario. how about building from that 1 missile against 1 ship thing to multiple missile against 1 ship.have a system that auto focus fires all blue fof's on the grid to target 1 ship via auto communication between the missiles (technically using randomising non blue targetting selections).so not only using fof for identifying the multiple foes but also the multiple friendly fof missiles and using that as an advantage."
5/25/2011,these ships can easily be located in much less than 15 min in a familiar system if you care to put in the effort.not supported.
5/25/2011,"there is so much whine and tears, it must continue. not supported."
5/25/2011,"for about 1/3rd the income you get when you run lvl 4 missions in high sec yes. useful unprobable mission setups also need a way to run gatecamps, get a t3 and look how much dps it does when unprobable, covert ops cloak and interdiction nullifier. it is pretty close to zero.you can kill an unprobable mission runner with some luck at a gate, you cannot kill him when he moves to high sec because otherwise he has to press a scan button every 10 seconds."
5/25/2011,"i'm gonna bring unprobable ship in the any system you like. if you find it within 15 minutes - you won. if you don't - i won.i suggest entry fee at least @ 1 bil with someone like chribba as guarantee. feel free to evemal/convo me ingame to coordinate.the best result i'm aware of - about 30 minutes, personally i can do it in about 2 hours (not much experience, yeah). this is not true at all. pvp ships often have the same dps as pve counterparts, but are ought to lose some tank (point) and cap stability (which is countered by cap booster easily, also giving you ability to tank under neuts).in certain conditions (which are heavily exploited by agentrunners) you don't need to go through gates. just bring couple of twinks into the hub with 3+ agents - and you're done.and, yes, this topic concerns only unscannable setups; cloaks and interdiction nullifiers are out of its scope. please consider only unscannable vs scannable setups here, leaving interdiction nullifier and covops cloak for other topics.i don't mind if they go hisec. i'm not motivated by desire to kill such ships at all."
5/25/2011,"yes! i very much support this idea. i started the day eve was released, without any clue as to what i should train. made several stupid mistakes, which i have done my best to make up for later on. 5-10 skills or so would be great to remap."
5/25/2011,"ah, the foot in the door approach.no remaps. this has been discussed to death and remarkably few players are in favour.why would you need to remap, you can *always* learn the skill you want to now, there is no skill point cap, skills do not become harder to train as you get more sp, in fact - with expensive implants they get slightly easier.this isn't even a matter of choice, since you can easily train multiple skill trees, and you can choose more skills at any time. it's simply a matter of getting the skills you want *right now*.there are few 'wrong choices' in skill training, as (almost) every skill has a purpose of some kind, and adds to your options or your effectiveness, so work with what you've chosen, and work towards what you want.cyberus - what skill is it you have that you have decided you won't ever need or use? what skill is so important that you must have it immediately?"
5/25/2011,"there is no important skills to me atm since i'm prety good trained for almost all ships and all guns in game 101 m sp atm (on subcapital ships).if you realy want to know wich skills i will/could trade of for some sp. well ther is actualy no so much at all. (some mining and related ships to it)it is even not so big amount at all but as you know by you self mining profession since the 2003 become utely useless and to players even with 6 months or 1 year training is simply not usefull skill anymore simply because any other activity in the game can and will generate you better income then sucking rocks in belts.i have even some production skills as well but it is not my main activity with this acount but i wont trade for sp this skills because i use from time to time those so that makes then usefull even if i realy use it once at 3-6 months. but it is simply nothing to be compared with mining skills and anything related to it.blame ccp or blame those bot/macro alliances who made those skills complete waste of sp invested in to it.while lots says mistakeble skills training they are wrong, there is few to none mistakable skills ( like core skills or frigat/cruiser hulls ) those are needet skills for advanced versions hulls so those are not mistake thats why i cross trained all hulls and weapons in game and can switch to any subcap ship or weapon and always glad i have trained those but some of the other skills its just useless nothing more ( atleast they become useless )."
5/25/2011,"this idea got messed up at the point someone thought caldari should be long range.current system is just fine. ammunition and ship bonuses need reworking. most of ammo types are useless crap and caldari ships are still useless even with slight boost, coz their damage just sucks. instead of thinking that caldari = long range gallente = short range we should have shield tank hybrid ships and armor tank hybrid ships.also artillery needs nerfbat back to 2007, like logistics."
5/25/2011,"current system is not fine. artillery is fine.personally, i love the op's idea and i go one further by suggesting that they kill off all drones to eliminate 50% of all lag and reduce the use of missiles on caldari ships to eliminate 30% of the lag that remains."
5/25/2011,just give caldari projectiles. thatll make me happy ;).
5/25/2011,this just in.. covert bombers have no tank and are easily vollied by most ratting ships.
5/25/2011,"perhaps concord is the solution. i'm sure there exists a game mechanic wherein concord can come into a system and prevent, or at least punish, unwanted pvp. the speed and degree of punishment would vary on some sort of security scale. each system would be ranked on this scale from -1.0 to +1.0. if, for example, you're pveing in a +1.0 system, and an afk cloaker decloaks and touches you in a bad place, concord would swoop in to punish the transgressor. if on the other hand, you live in say... 0.4 security space, concord wouldn't respond, but the stations and gates could be fitted with protective guns.of course, anyone in 0.0 to -1.0 space is obviously skilled enough to either rat in a pvp ship or know how to organize a corp for mutual defence. if such a system is ever implemented, you would just need to go to one of the higher security systems and pve to your hearts content."
5/25/2011,we put forth a ton of effort to claim and build our systems. it should not have to be a non-stop effort to actually enjoy it moron!
5/25/2011,"then you should make sure to have proper defence fleets assembled to protect the interest of your precious systems while you profit from them. i don't see how that makes me a moron if you can't manage that...so no one is allowed to enter your systems? please petition me if i happen to do so, i doubt anyone will listen to you."
5/25/2011,"like i said, you demand that the 0.0 locals be vigilant 24/7. you demand that they have fleets on stand-by 24/7. you demand that unconsensual pvp be brought to them. you demand that their ratters and miners be exposed to risk. the same rules should apply to afk cloakers. at the moment they don't. if you want to ""subvert local"" 23/7 months on end feel free to do it but do it at the keyboard, just as you would expect a miner or a ratter to be at the keyboard to do their jobs. i really don't have a problem with you cloaking in a system for hours and days. i have a problem with you being able to do it while sleeping or at the pizza parlor. and yes, right now you're allowed to do it, just as i'm allowed to raise my concerns about this issue.afk cloakers seem to be the most risk-adverse out of this whole situation. they simply do not want any type of risk presented to them. not in any form and not in any degree. suggestions like this one have been proposed that specifically target afk and inattentive cloakers allowing even the most crappy of cloaker to continue to do his job. and you still squeal like pigs at the suggestion that ccp add a little risk to you.you accuse us of being ""botters"". or you play on the literal definition of afk cloaking to some how save you. or you resot to calling those that agree to adding risk to afk cloakers cowards, when in fact you are the cowards. i am not advocating the removal of risk. i am asking that risk is brought to you. but you see, you dont want risk. it's funny that you tell others to go back to hi sec for not wanting to be exposed to risk when you yourself tremble at the thought of risk being added to you.many of you support the removal of local because ""it works in wormhole space"". but, as is typical with your arguments, you fail to mention that wormhole space has difficult entry points that counter the removal of local and in favor of the residents. you fail to mention this in your arguments because as always, you just want the game mechanics to benefit you and screw your enemies. you don't seem to be capable of playing fair and be able to win. like i said, you are the most risk-adverse players in the game. the ones that resort to calling others carebears for the same exact reasons you yourself are guilty of."
5/25/2011,"simple question yet again, can you prove people to be afk? it's a serious accusation to make claiming people to be afk, esspecially if you can't prove it. please stop this ranting or go live in high sec space if you can't handle it, that space is for guys like you that don't want risc's involved in your gameplay. off you go."
5/25/2011,"here's the thing murkelost,normally, humans require sleep to function properly. when a character (that is supposed to be controlled by a human) is logged in for 23/7 week after week, month after month even, i think it is safe to assume that this human may not be at the keyboard at least part of the time. i've read your previous responses, and quite frankly, it seems this will be difficult for you to understand so i won't waste our times any further. i'm afraid you'll first need to understand some basic concepts on how the human body functions to understand why a player cannot be logged in 23/7. so i won't be able to help you much :(."
5/25/2011,"it's ok, i dont need your help, thanx though"
5/25/2011,"i haven't demanded anything. i simply state the fact that local is at the root of this. that remains the truth, no matter what you say. your reliance upon locals instant intel, is being messed with.which is an emotional feeling, you're allowed to convey. doesn't alter the fact that local, is at the root of it and people pay for their account so can do whatever they want within the rules.again, you're allowed to convey any emotional response, the facts remain.others may have accused you of those things, i simply don't want your all seeing eye, given more power than it already has.but there are certain areas of null sec renowned for botting. you can't deny that whining increases, when those areas are focused on. it's only human nature that some will make the link and post their thoughts.i've stated many times the differences and have only noted that afk cloaking is pointless there, due to the lack of local. i also have said numerous times, i prefer the status quo.i have also always said that local cannot be replaced, unless a suitable replacement package is found. so far, ccp have not been able to find that package.i cannot remember the last time i called someone a carebear.i can see your emotions are taking over, but at least be honest in your replies."
5/25/2011,"you should really stop thinking every post is directed at you.also, local is not broken. it is a huge part of what makes the game playable for the average player. they took local out of wh space and in order to make it appealing to the general public they made several other changes that allowed residents the upper hand and limit the possibility of posing any real threat to them.in 0.0, in order to gain intel from local you must also present intel to other. its a balanced system. the only thing that local does is stop people from actually sneaking into a system without the knowledge of the others in system. if thats what you want to do, sneak around without others knowing your there, then find a worm hole."
5/25/2011,bump becouse i'm being ignored
5/25/2011,cry less
5/25/2011,"be less idiot, i'm not crying, but you are spamming"
5/25/2011,i think a fine tweak will come as they said. like advisory division with 50% killing missions suddenly became distribution. this means corps like starter npc's dont have any security agent (missions) anymore.soe are some kind of special. i think it would made sense to establish a lvl 4 agent in each faction area for high sec and low sec. hub areas would tend to negate the effect of creating less traffic. therefore a remote area would be sensible.
5/25/2011,"i read that devblog twice looking for the part where the intent was allowing people to live where they want. i couln't find it. i dont think ccp cares where you want to live. there's still a lv 4 agent in gicodel. if you want to live there, break out your hauler. if you want to shoot stuff, move to caldari space. i too would like a lv 4 combat agent right next to a quiet trade hub where i can overcharge for crap loot and drops. oh wait..."
5/25/2011,"support this thread if you are amarr/amarr or caldari/achura or something else and you were robbed of your 2 useful attribute points by ccp. who then put those 2 points into charisma, turning your 3 charisma into 5. ccp, you now have 24 hours to give us our 3 charisma back and put 2 attribute points back where they were before the nerf. if our demands are not met, 50 hamsters will be fed to pythons every hour after the deadline."
5/25/2011,everybody is free to keep charisma at 3 points: just don't use neural remap and that's it.

5/25/2011,"i am all for afking in an unprobable ship. it may take me a few hours but i will find you eventually. unprobable ships are a perfect example of what i think cloaking should resemble. you can warp to a safe in an unprobable ship and be safe for a good bit of time, but plain and simple, you still can be found given enough time and effort. if you could be found while cloaked in the way that you can be found in an unprobable ship i would not have any issue with cloaking"
5/25/2011,"let me get this clear. you spend hours looking for someone that could be unprobable, off d-scan and at a deep safe. no one actually knows they aren't cloaked up, but in the chance that they're simply hanging about in an unprobable ship, means you would take that time out?no wonder your upset with afking, you must spend all your day looking for them, whenever someone enters your system for any length of time.laughter aside, it still relies upon local to have an effect. but at least you acknowledge that now."
5/25/2011,i agree.or the module shoud be mono-cicle.
5/25/2011,"seconding that the solution to afk cloaking is to remove local, and as i pointed out in that thread"
5/25/2011,a few d-scans would be able to tell you that they were in an unprobable ship. and the point is that an unprobable ship is a serious pain to find but it can be found eventually if the player has walked away. a cloaked ship on the other hand can not ever ever ever ever ever be found.it doesn't matter if removing local would make it less common for people to afk cloak. its that fact that you can afk cloak that is the issue. cloaking should have some limiting factor to its invulnerability besides downtime. preferable one controlled by other players.
5/25/2011,"but without local, a cloaked ship afk is totally powerles. they can't gather intel, and because you can't see them, they can't stop you from ratting without actually uncloaking to stop you from ratting. in fact, it's functionally no different to logging off, which, btw i can do in a non-cloaky ship without local and have the same effect. should i not be able to do that?you've already said that you don't want to penalise people who cloak but aren't afk, so you'd be happy for a chap to sit 10km off you with no local cloaked whilst you ran your anomaly, waiting for the right moment to pounce on you - even if it took 30-40 mins (for argument's sake) but not for him to be chilling somewhere in system. they're functionally the same thing, unless of course you actually do want to penalise people who cloak."
5/25/2011,well i was talking with my mates and we were thinking. why not put a rider on the insurance that covers the modals? like pay this much extra isk to insure for more. if you take a modal off your ship the rider is void.not to mention the current standard insurance doesn't pay for the ship with full coverage anyway. just the ship. the insurance needs to be overhauled and i understand a flat insurance is easy on the servers but it would be nice if it changed based on market costs so people don't abuse the system again.i bring this to you because it is not worth insuring ships at all in eve.
5/25/2011,"in the not too distant past, platinum insurance paid out 100% of the value of the hull and the cost of buying the insurance. it was nerfed because it made suicide ganking absurdly easy and everyone was getting a little too rich. thus they made it so it only pays around 50% of the hull value after including the cost of it.not supported."
5/25/2011,"insurance isn't meant to cover the cost of your ship, let alone the cost of the modules you have fitted. if it covered everything, losing ships wouldn't mean anything. the system is already dynamic and is changed based on market cost of the materials used to build the ship and it is done exactly to make sure it will never cover the cost of your ship mainly in order to prevent insurance fraud.it's also always worth it to insure your ships in eve, if you are certain that you will lose it during the insurance period. it's just that the insurance system isn't designed to fully cover ship losses and the varying pay levels allow players to better manage their risks in the game, by providing them a way to cover varying levels of the loss based mainly on ship tech level.not supported."
5/25/2011,"insurance wasn't nerfed because of suicide ganking, which is supported and inteded, but because some industrialists were building tens of thousands of tier 3 bs purely to self-destruct them for the insurance."
5/25/2011,"that...to avoid suicide ganking you would need the aggressor to pay for your loss - best in time effort. though the time effort is vastly in favour of suicide ganking the game mechanic itself is part of the game and wont be removed. but it could do with a balancing tweak, that your standing repair is heavier and need more time.about the insurances as they are now its useless and you can get rid of it straight away. to be worth something the insuring period must be 6 month or more for the low pay out in the case of destruction."
5/25/2011,"let me explain it in simple terms - if it's a pve ship, and you're not an idiot - don't insure it. it shouldn't get blown up often enough to be worth it.if it's a pvp ship - insure it. if it lasts for longer than 12 weeks, then you are pvping wrong."
5/25/2011,dump insurance entirely. no insurance company would insure a starship.
5/25/2011,"insurance should at least account for the prices of faction vessels, which it currently does not."
5/25/2011,"simple idea. easy to implement (we already have secure containers with logs), but so missed feature.corporation hangars logs. all corporation hangars (include station offices and ship maintenance arrays) should have simple logs like secure containers, viewable by directors and auditors. we all know that ccp encourage thievery and scammers but please give ceo at least one simple instrument to monitor corporation activity."

5/25/2011,"1. u can find cloaked ships when they jump in. they don't magically appear out of thin air.2. see #1 and it's still more risk than any nullbear who runs and docks the instant a neutral appears. nothing more carebearish and risk-free than someone being protected still running and hiding just because his protection will never be concord-level. so yes, feel free to go back to high sec 'cause u're the one who brought up removing rats and asteroids in the first place."
5/25/2011,good luck catching anything with cov ops cloak in low sec or hi sec. not overpowered? not even dragging cov ops cloak + nullifier combo here. wait i just did.no one should give a poo-poo about cloaking bombers and macros. they're much less issue.

5/25/2011,by doing so days or weeks before hand and sitting afk. are you sure you know what this thread is about?
5/25/2011,"to bring ecm in line with the other ewar platforms, i propose this change:ecm mechanics will be changed to a more logical format. racial jammers will be exactly that, a racial jammer. for this to work, racial ecm jammers will only jam their specific race.you now have to match green to green and blue to blue. for those of you who haven't actually flown ecm ships before, a more simple model. example:gallente ships can only be jammed magnetometric ecm.caldari ships can only be jammed by gravimetric ecm.amarr ships can only be jammed by radar ecm.minmatar ships can only be jammed by ladar ecm.multispecs will be used as their name implies. multispecs will jam all races, but at a much lower success rate then racial specific jammers. this is not a nerf by any means to ecm and jamming, only a switch on how ecm is used. it makes a fully ladar fit falcon not be able to jam a drake, but instead forces ecm ships to pick wisely when fitting. to help ease the change, i also propose a small ehp buff to not only ecm ships but all ewar platforms (whishful thinking, but one can dream :p)let me know what you think and hopefully we can get enough people behind this."

5/25/2011,the likelihood of getting an off-race ecm jam on someone is extremely low. this proposal really wouldn't change anything in the game.
5/25/2011,"i'll probably be using this as a copy/paste to other ecm whines:if you're nerfing ecm, suggest a buff to ecm ships in general. they sacrifice everything to for their ewar capability, and what we don't need is another half dozen broken ships."
5/25/2011,"i'd rather see the other forms of e-war boosted, to be honest."
5/25/2011,agreed.
5/25/2011,"since this is not a nerf to ecm, what % boost to racial and multispectral strength are you proposing, to counterbalance the reduction of off-racial ecm strength to zero? 10%? 25%?"
5/25/2011,"bump, because i just spent 30 minutes arguing with people in fw."
5/25/2011,we both just did.was this pic posted b4?
5/25/2011,"supported , cuz i just listened to your argueing :p"
5/25/2011,.
5/25/2011,"to calm the fears of all those terrorized by seeing an afk cloaker in system, let's implement the change ccp said they were going to do so long ago and change nullsec local to delayed mode. wh corps have been living with this for a long while now, and make money just fine as far as i can see, so if nullsec residents are as good as wh corps, then it should be no problem for them to do the same."
5/25/2011,"what you can't see you can't fear, i approve of this.atleast it would cease the neverending rant on the forums as well."
5/25/2011,"there are many differences when trying to compare the w-space to null to make delayed local viable.null has a defined map and its easy to get around. there are no special skills needed to find your way around. stargates are on overview, asteroid belts are readily visible, sanctums and havens are now able to be found in 30 seconds at 64 au. making isk in w-space requires scanning skills. you have the ability to ""control"" access to the system, and people can't find you on a map and know the route to find you day and night. in null, the way to make isk is easy to find on the overview. the stargates have no mass limitations, lifetime or instant. nerfing local in null to match w-space is just not as practical with the ease of finding people at isk making activities, and navigating around null."
5/25/2011,"in w-space, all of the sleeper anomalies are found just as easily as in null-space, so your argument is invalid on that front. in fact, it's even more invalid because it is not possible to just wander around in a carrier grinding anoms solo whilst semi-afk - even before the risk of being jumped by people you can't see.in all respects then it sounds as if you're saying ""i should get special dispensation over and above people who live in a more hostile environment than me"""
5/25/2011,"foolish, what have you done!! tdrs in hydra .. tsk, tsk. the bleaks are not the same without the daily foolish blob big difference is the permanent gates in normal space, if w-space local rules were applied with no further changes made the roam would become insanely powerful and nigh unstoppable.will need to make the delay a fixed number of seconds (ex. 15s before appearing) or figure out another way of scanning to avoid the urge to scan-spam that a blank local tend to induce (ex. ability to filter scan by standings - think iff beacons)."
5/25/2011,i've supported it before and i'll support it again
5/25/2011,"alas i follow my ceo where he leads (mainly because it leads to alcohol, fun, pew and more alcohol), and in any case my rl commitments had basically banished the daily foolish roam to a fond memory .ot - were ratters to not change their behaviour at all, then i'd be inclined to agree with your assertion, but consider this - if one was in a gatecamp, would one simply have the whole fleet on one side of the gate with no eyes on the other side to see what was about to come through? also, let's say you're ratting in a system with 4-5 other people all in space. why aren't you all chatting, drinking and generally interacting with each other? why aren't you in a fleet with the same number of ships, but those ships being fit for pvp with logistic support? why wouldn't you invite new alliance members to do the looting and salvaging once you've cleared each site, happy in the knowledge that they're protected and that there'll be meta mods and salvage for rigs for you to buy on your local markets without having to do the hauling from jita and supporting your newer players at the same time? why, in an alliance of thousands, would you ever be alone?this change will basicallycurtail bottingstop afk cloakers from stopping you ratting (because they'd have to not be afk to actually stop you ratting)encourage people to work together for fun and profitboost viability of roaming gangs, whilst making them work to ensure that they're not walking into a massive trap"
5/25/2011,"ebay does a great job of weeding out scammers by allowing buyers to rate the sellers after the purchase, and gives them a rating for it. buyers can then choose to only buy from the top rated sellers.we should have the same in eve contracts."
5/25/2011,"you could just move to a system further from lowsec, which would also reduce your decline rate."
5/25/2011,"well you have several claims, first the pos one. railguns on a moros for example have 0.0012 tracking while 1000 sig radius, so against a pos (6000 sig radius) they have 0.0072 tracking. multiply that against 30km (shield radius), and you got 0.216, so 0.216km/s=216m/s you can move in order for it to have 50% hit chance, (speed=tracking speed), with 10m/s you are so enormously below that it isnt any problem. the supercap at 15km, you not gonna like it but i am just going to use eft since it does the calculations correctly. rail moros vs nyx, rail moros has 4431 eft dps, at 15km against a nyx moving at full transversal (which is impossible against a larger dread fleet), your dps is lowered to 3911, so you still do 89% of your max dps, i dont call that speed tanking.now a bs can indeed speed tank a dread, also when it has lower tracking penalty, if it is close enough to the dread. however if you want to lower the penalty from something like 90% to 20-25% they will virtually have the tracking of titans, titans are used against bs, so then a dread can also hit that bs (granted it has some other downsides). also a bs can be webbed down and painted, making it easier to track."
5/25/2011,"i ran those numbers too and got the same results. you have to go under 10 km before there's an appreciable problem. cruise phoenix had no problem at any range or speed, although i doubt that you'll be impressed by advice to use capital missiles! (torp phoenix 83% damage.)dreads are so well balanced because they're so ineffective against subcapitals. if there is a problem with them tracking supercaps, the answer surely lies in changes to supercap speed and sig, rather than dread tracking."
5/25/2011,cant believe i missed initial post ....
5/25/2011,"in low sec or null sec if you engage you cannot dock for a period of time, this is so people can gather a fleet and **** you in return.why the hell can war targets engage and when they feel they cant win dock up again? so take the orphanage for example they're supposed to big and bad war deccing every null sec alliance, but if they had the same rules as we did and they couldn't dock after engaging would it be the same story? no, they would be totally ****d. what i want to understand is why is the game mechanics different in high sec from low/null? ccp want more fighting? well have the same mechanics all round then that way us null sec alliances can come and **** them in return like we would in null."
5/25/2011,"i always found it very stupid to see combat in front of a station, it's like a fight in front of a police station. anyway, make it harder for the chickens, sure why not"
5/25/2011,the aggression mechanic is the same in high sec as well. are you referring to neutral remote repair and other remote devices?
5/25/2011,"you are not really supporting a change, the op doesn't want to stop station mechanics, just change them to work the same in hi sec as they do in lo or null.the catch is that the aggro mechanics that allow and disallow docking are the same in all three sec lvls. so really this doesn't actually change anything."
5/25/2011,"no it isn't, because the eve online source code keeps being leaked so bots are likely being built to interface directly with the code."
5/25/2011,is there a chance the csm could ask how the source code keeps being leaked. tends to make it difficult to hunt down botters and exploiters if they have access to your source code. is ccp doing something to try to prevent leaks like this? this isn't the first time it has been known to have been leaked.
5/25/2011,"i believe it is actually a secret plan to harness the power of open source development, without the nasty side-effect of infecting other people's code with the gpl virus."
5/25/2011,"*bangs head against wall* losing a ship is not an economic isk sink! it is a material sink! how hard is that to understand?even if all isk payout would be removed, losing a ship would still be isk-neutral."
5/25/2011,"even if the guns can hit bs rats, the locking time still makes almost any other ship more effective.give dreads some extra utility highslots, that way they can nos/neut/smartbomb.along with this give them the ability to fit ganglinks. as all of the other combat capitals are able to fit them.maybe give them a small corp hanger,"
5/26/2011,"*sigh* so sad to see ccp turning into the type of large corp that i coach back into sanity in my work. i see this all the time: large projects, programs or what have you don't know how to scale up. the interleaving of ""smaller things"" like what is asked for in this thread and the ""large shiny things"" is one of those things that companies just don't get.first problem is that they start doing resource management. there's project a, b, c, d and the maintenance queue, and then they get ""resourced"". so all the people in teams get assigned all over the place, their time is literally shattered in a million pieces, and teams' productivity and quality is shattered as well. the answer is that the teams should be stable, and all those projects should be chopped up into their respective pieces, and fed to stable teams in stable queues. this works magic.i know ccp uses the scrum process, i trained some of their people. but i've only seen them put up a job opening for a scrum master, which is not the tough job that's failing here."
5/26/2011,"1. more and varied pos roles2. better pos gunning interface and allow alliance members to pos gun3. some ""add- ons "" to poses to make them more varied in role , for example ""siege - active mod that uses fuel and increases pos defence and offence by 50% "" , ""miner - adds 10% to moon yield , lowers defences by 30% "" , "" reactor - 50% to cpu "" 4. faster anchoring"
5/26/2011,"there is this skill called anchoring which is a complete waste of time to train bc it does basically next to nothing.there is an outcry from the eve population and myself included that poses need to be quicker to set up and taken down.hold on to your pants, they're about to drop change the anchoring skill to allow the anchoring of an additional module per lvl of the skill up to 3 (number of max mods can be changed from 5-2) and introduce a new skill that decreases the anchoring/unanchoring time by 5% per lvl. -ability to set pos specific roles-ability to name pos modules-ability to name individual corp hangar tabs-introduction of ship main tabs-simplified moon goo setup (combine harvester with silos and coupling arrays, etc)-introduce the fuel pellet as a seeded bpo (non-researchable; makes it optional use)-change fuel bays to last 1 month instead of 20days"
5/26/2011,"one issue i see driving a lot of new players off is summed up in this video.there is nothing stopping experienced established players beating up on new players, and little incentive for those experienced players to help the new players.this is a pvp focused game and new players need to be able to fly alongside experienced players to be able to pick up the skills (player skills, not character skills) to be able to cope in the harsh world that is eve.some people can repeatedly take a beating and get up again having learned from the experience and will be a better player for it. those people are rare though, and many people getting that experience will move on to somewhere else (ie another game).ernest adams told me that he doesn't play eve for the same reason he doesn't holiday in somalia, and that has stuck with me. if you're a hardened warrior then a holiday in somalia might be quite enjoyable, but for the rest (most) of the population, the thought isn't so pleasant."
5/26/2011,this really needs to be done.
5/26/2011,ccp what have you been doing all this time?
5/26/2011,"please add some quality readable fonts as an option to the ui. the present font is very hard to read at times!to me, this is the single most important feature you can add to the ui at this time."
5/26/2011,making spaceships...wait. making avatars for spaceship pilots.
5/26/2011,"supported. i spent alot of time trying to make the most ""me"" look i could when i started playing eve so i knew i'd be happy with it compared to the other options. now with the new creator the toon i really want to make is only possible with a different race/bloodline. eats me up every time i log on"
5/26/2011,no way.fugly achuras should remain ugly forever. accept your disgrace.
5/26/2011,"that i would be in favor of. there are a lot of us that have perfectly capable machines that do not have the massive bandwidth that incarna seems to be designed for, and many more of us that don't have any interest in this ""walking around in stations"" stuff at all. there is no reason this stuff should be crammed down our throats."
5/26/2011,"personally, i have no problem with incarna. and i happen to think all the people *****ing about it are sad, strange little people who seriously need to get out more.that said, there is no reason for the cq not to be optional other than to pad the uptake metrics so:supported!"
5/26/2011,please for the love all things internet spaceship related make cq optional!
5/26/2011,"er... actually for all games, and most mmos, system requirements generally don't change with time. and at least they don't change for effectively meaningless patches."
5/26/2011,"+1simple--we were promised incarna would be optional, and that promise needs to be kept for all aspects of it. ccp needs to establish some credibility for the good of the game; it's long overdue."
5/26/2011,"supporting. not for computer reasons but because i don't want to use incarna, and i hate forced stuff."
5/26/2011,"i like what we have seen on duality, and am looking forward to spin my character instead of my ship whenever i spend more than a few minutes docked. most of the time i only dock to load some cargo, get the next mission, or do a quick refit, though. in those situations the cq will be a major immersion breaker."
5/26/2011,yes. optional please.
5/26/2011,"i support the topic.screw you ccp if you **** us up making it non-optionnal.this was the ""deal"" when you first announced all this crap walking stuff.lots of players don't give a damn about having a sims in eve, i play eve for adrenalin, for excitation of fights, not to see my character in 3d.you were drunk once, or get a lead designer completely stupid who convinced you guys to make a sims-like feature that would take 3 years of development? ok, don't worry, you'll pay it in the end, but don't make it non-optionnal as there are still lots of people who don't wanna have anything to do with that crap.so please. for this game's sakes, make it optionnal.i don't wanna have some more lag, some more loading just because you were drunk and made the worst decision ever about game design.make it optionnal, as it doesn't bring anything to the game."
5/26/2011,"log into duality on a machine with less than 512mb of graphics ram and note that even on low detail settings, it takes minutes to get to the point that you can actually click those omnipresent buttons.over to you"
5/26/2011,what does that make the people *****ing about the people *****ing about cq?
5/26/2011,"signed, simply so that the dinosaurs who can't handle progress will shut up about it"
5/26/2011,"i wasn't aware they had removed the option to have it optional. no reason it shouldn't be, except to force players to use it, or make it an immersive experience for new players, by placing them in that environment first, with no option.so make it optional to not use cq, by pushing a button that says no. like so: q: enter cq? a: no!personally, i'm not going to use it until it has somethinbg t o back it up and give it purpose. try it out sure, once in awhile to make sure it still works? why not. but stand in my cq everytime i dock, or whenever i'm docked? not likely."
5/26/2011,"can we also make suicide ganking optional? a lot of folk don't want it.can we make pvp optional too? i sure hate when i get pvp'd.also, please make undocking optional. ship spinning is great fun, and cq seems to be messing that up. i've not seen any demos showing that ship spinning is still possible on the hologram or in the hangar.oh wait!it wouldn't be an equal environment for everyone if those things were optional. same goes with incarna. not supported."
5/26/2011,"actually, it's significantly different. this is more like being able to disable the intro video at every log in because not everyone wants to watch the pretty cutscene every time they log in."
5/26/2011,"undocking is optional... ever heard of station trading?you have a choice of whether or not you do certain things in eve, like missioning, or mining. atm incarna has no content, if/when it gains content that people want to use, people can choose whether or not to take part in it (whether we automatically appear in cq or not). ccp can't make people use incarna, all they can do is make people load it. making it optional hurts no-one and does nothing to make eve unequal."
5/26/2011,"supported for sure, there's no good reason for this not to be optional, those saying it makes more work for ccp seem to be ignoring that this has already been implemented in the earlier version shown, then removed for whatever reasonsimple checkbox for preference somewhere in esc settings, and button to load from current hangar, simple, easy, and everyones happy"
5/26/2011,"if your system is that poor (which mine is come to think of it) then simply tell windows not to allow access to the cq texture file (which is not an eula breach, you are not doing anything to any part of eve, windows is simply preventing part of it from graphically loading)."
5/26/2011,for reference purposes these are my specs.i get about 5 fps on lowest settings on duality with these.intel<U+FFFD> core i5-650 processor2 3.2ghz 8192mb ddr3 dual-channel 1333mhz memorynvidia<U+FFFD> geforce<U+FFFD> g310 graphics card 512mb
5/26/2011,"my tower, which i tend not to use, has lower settings then that and i get 18-24 fps. are you running tranq at the same time?of course it seems that most of the textures used to not load. an update must have been recent because now it even works on my laptop."
5/26/2011,"nope, nothing at all but cq *shrug* runs 5 clients of tq with no problems too. thanks for the info tho, maybe my graphics card just doesn't like cq."
5/26/2011,tbh the only real reason that i can see why ccp have made it so currently we will be forced to leave our ships is because lets be honest after 2 minutes in cq very few are going to bother looking at it again its not like there is really any content.
5/26/2011,i like spinning my ship.
5/26/2011,"i would like to have the option to load incarna or not.when the incursion patch came out, my pc could not load eve anymore, because it does not support sse2. before the patch, it could ran 2 accounts easily. it still works with other stuff. i also read the forums and read how most people were ranting those who could not afford to upgrade their pc, which i'm one of them. ( ccp stated this sse2 would affect only 0.03% of the playerbase)so now i was forced to use the laptop, although it has issue's when i do character creation. with eve online in low settings, i'm able to run 1 account only. i need to shut one account to acces the other. now with this incarna coming up, my laptop will not be able to load it. so after nearly 7 years playing eve, not the 21st of may, but 21st of june will be sragir's judgement day. and to those, who always have their smart opinions:no, i have no ****ing magic tree in my backyard, where fallen leaves turn into shiny 100,00 banknotes."
5/26/2011,"but ccp hates gallente, so it'll never get implemented."
5/26/2011,"honestly, simply leaving things imbalanced and broken with the hopes that a mechanic change like this would make supercaps too obnoxious to use... seems like a bad idea. this 'fix' is like smearing crap on a public restroom stall that's out of order, it doesn't fix anything, just discourages the use of what's broken.supercaps would still be imbalanced/uncounterable, and 'even more expensive' doesn't really fix that."
5/26/2011,"yeap.but looks like the saturation point in this respect hasn't been achieved yet.given we've known ccp for ages, i doubt they will bother fixing anything untill each one of the playerbase owns at least one supercap.this ******ization within masses will eventually result in everyone 'saving up' for a supercap which he surely can not afford to lose. if anything, this breaks the basic eve rule - do not fly something you can't afford to lose. so at the end of the day any pvp will cease. and 18 months from there ccp might actually say something in this regard."
5/26/2011,/waves handthis is not the super capital nerf you are looking for. move along.
5/26/2011,wow .. i really like that analogy
5/26/2011,"the op has a nice idea, but i think you guys are missing out on a massive opportunity here. large quantities of normal isotopes are one thing, but that's bland and not very interesting.suppose instead that supercapitals required a special, highly refined form of fuel -- perhaps a mixture of their normal fare and a touch of liquid ozone and heavy water. make it a reaction thing.now you've got to protect your pos infrastructure for both constructing and maintaining your supercapital fleet. i think that's a nice touch."
5/26/2011,"make fb's either unable to attack anything but other supers and structures, or tweak the mechanics so that its useless to use fb's on normal caps and lower. i'd like to dust off my dread one of these years..."
5/26/2011,did i just read a good idea on the assembly hall?/signed for awesomeness
5/26/2011,"pretty much this. you aren't fixing anything with your proposals. you're ignoring the imbalances and just trying to increase the cost of acheiving it or put in limits, so the damage they do is somewhat contained. they just need to be rebalanced and that is it and that might very well mean nerfing their capabilities in battle.there are many ways to rebalance them though, but it needs to be done in some form. increasing costs doesn't solve anything though. it just limits the use to fewer people and delays the inevitable proliferation. a cost based solely on movement is even worse, since it still leaves them as overpowered defence assets while nerfing using them aggressively. that means less supers destroyed, while being forced to rely more on non-supercap fleets to attack supercap defended systems. when your complaint is that you need a supercap fleet to engage a supercap fleet, this isn't going to end well.there are two basic way you can go about the rebalance. either seriously bring down the capabilities of supercaps or create realistic and practical vulnerabilities for them even when they operate as a group. i'm hoping ccp goes more the way of creating weaknesses for them, but they will have to get nerfed and made more vulnerable to non-supercap fleets."
5/26/2011,interesting idea but for alliances that make billions in moon gold this will have no effect on their pockets - why cant ppl realise that!
5/26/2011,i have always thought that turning jump machanics on its head and only allow jumps to super caps by non caps would work better maybe with a larger range so more people get in on a fight but the total dps on the field does not climb as fast. if you included it with your idea then moving a super cap is a stratigic decision but allows the rest of the players to still get good fights.
5/26/2011,"this pretty much. i do think the idea has some merit, but only as part of a larger package since this does not actually fix that scs are simply overpowered in combat."
5/26/2011,"can a dev comment if this is in the littlethings team or works in general? i'm hoping so since turrets are seeing an update, but there hasn't been a peep on how missiles will be updated?"
5/26/2011,plus one for da goons idea
5/26/2011,"any race really, none of the tech 1 ships have any significant differences in technology, so the comparative cost and ability imbalances make little sense.in theory, yes. but in actuality, all tiers do is arbitrarily gimp stats and entire lines of ships.it almost seems like tech 1 ships were prenerfed for tiering reasons so that tech 2 ships can be that much more powerful in direct comparison.to be fair, lasers are the most damaging weapons with no ships bonus applied.precisely the goal of tiericide.see above."
5/26/2011,"not really, between the better fitting of autocannons allowing for more tank, dmg selection and being completely capless, without a combet bonus they are just better. cap use is a terrible bonus for these ships, it gets completely ignored for fitting capless weapons. there should be an incentive to fit them, if people want the better fitting, capless ones they can still use them but if they want a weapons bonus that will help them in combat then fit lasers. a cap bonus without a weapons bonus is just sad.it wouldn't overpower the ship, ham's have the same range as pulse and heavies longer range then beams so the prophecy wouldn't be any more powerful then the drake. the maller would still have no frig defense and the punisher would have to give up tank to fit them. i think a dmg bonus along with teiracide would be a good thing to get lasers to be used on these ships.that wasn't really a question to be answered, more of a statement...of support."
5/26/2011,"you need to be careful of the balance between ship classes, as well as between ships in a class. i'm thinking specifically of the balance between cruisers and battlecruisers here, as well as between battlecruisers and the awful close-range hacs that no-one flies (deimos and sacrilege)."
5/26/2011,"sorry, i just had to"
5/26/2011,"i actually saw someone flying a deimos a few days ago. but when i killed it, despite their falcon, eve-kill refused to accept the mail, saying that it was malformed! maybe i should have edited the ship type to ""diemost""... battleclinic, being more old-fashioned, was happy to accept the mail with this museum-piece on though."
5/26/2011,i know that.
5/26/2011,"hiding agent standings makes sense.corp and faction standings are necessary for all kinds of things, as already mentioned.as for the gm's reasoning for removing all standings - yes, assuming agent standings are hidden, you can still find out which npc corps a player does missions for. but that will cover a large area. even more so now that all agents quality are the same."
5/26/2011,"annoying as hell and you cant even kill them!we do the work by finding the targets and shooting them, allow us lets us get the loot rewards as well.at least give them aggression and docking timer so we can shoot them! being allowed to insta dock is stupid"
5/26/2011,don't let the door hit you on the way out.
5/26/2011,yes this is a pain...
5/26/2011,"a thief is a thief no matter how he dresses!if someone steals he should be punished...in real life and in game!!i say...no docking for 1 hourno targeting skills for 1 hourno use of stargates for 1 hourallow not only you, but also your corp and alliance instant attack for just touching your wreck or can, but not to pod him! let him sit there for 1 hour lol and timer should only work when in game !!!"
5/26/2011,"honestly, i can't argue with the logic here. ninja lotting is a profession in eve sure, but so is missioning. if you can't disrupt their profession, how come they can yours? it's not like the mission pay out or bounty is worth it. the real 'loot' reward has always been the salvage, and the guys getting it, don't actually have to do anything to earn it.i say remove aggression mechanics entirely, straight across highsec, low, and null. no concord, no station and gate guns, and nothing else. let us sort it out, because concord is seriously incompetent.honestly, if eve is going to be 100% pvp focused, then they might as well remove all that nonsense that gets in the way.anyone who wants to make a thread on removing aggression mechanics and going all out pvp can just quote me. i'll add my support later."
5/26/2011,"um, yes you can. shoot em. if they loot you can shoot.if you don't want to because you think they will come back and kill you in a bigger ship, well that is your own problem."
5/26/2011,no the issue is you cant shoot them when they can insta dock! they should get docking timer!
5/26/2011,"wait, your talking about kills outside station?stop playing station games you fool. then they can't instadock.anyway, a lot of ninja looters won't dock unless locked. so they are quite easy to kill.1) have a friend in a mwd bs bump them out of station range (generally won't warp away because they think its just someone toying with them), though this is optional2) fit a passive targeter3) blow the stuffing out of them"
5/26/2011,so ill stop killing people at stations just so ninja looters can get my loot - stop posting fool!which game are you playing? all ninja looters who are not stupid insta dockquite simply a docking timer should be in place - tell me whats the point of having aggression if you can instantly dock? eh?i mean everyone else who gets agression cant insta dock so why can ninja looters? it needs to be sorted simple.and the people disagreeing with this must be the ninja looters themselves
5/26/2011,"sounds reasonable.while they are at it, ccp should do something to ruin station games permanently."
5/26/2011,lol... suicide ganker whines about station humping theif stealing the loot first????
5/26/2011,"dude at least get you facts right if your gonna troll, if you must know its empire wars - sorry buts if everyone who gets agression cant dock then neither should ninja looters - its simple - unless you can come up with a good argument against then stop trolling"
5/26/2011,"well since salvage is just that...""salvage"" and it isn't yours to claim even if you killed the ship i guess there isn't a problem. ccp has said on many several occaisions that salvage is not the property of the person who killed the ship.end of discussion.oh...and the op is full of fail...just like it's writer apparently."
5/26/2011,the game is becoming completely risk free pvp - neut rrs. really..personally i think allowing any ship to remote rep is stupid and should be left to specialist ships but mehso back to neut rr - either give them gcc or make it that only corp/allainces members can rep each other.this is just stupid - sorry
5/26/2011,"the intel benefit is not equal for both parties. as soon as you see local go up, you can be getting yourself to safety in much less time than you could ever be found and locked down. it's not that i think you should have no means of knowing when someone comes into the system, i just think that there should be some risk to every action you take in eve. as it is right now someone ratting in a system is at absolutely no risk. there should be at least enough risk to discourage not having scouts or joining a fleet whilst ratting. right now there are no possible consequences for a player who wants to rat by himself without getting shot.ratting should have some way of knowing when hostile gangs are coming. preferably one controlled by other players.wait... this sounds familiarah, i'm so glad to see that you agree with me. i can expect your support on my thread then."
5/26/2011,"except the fact that that made no sense what so ever. ratting is a relatively safe activity true, but it is far from riskless. it take what, 45 seconds to scan down a carrier, another 15 to warp to them. a 1 min lapse in attention and you are locked down. thats a far cry from the complete invulnerability of a cloaked ship."
5/26/2011,"if the carrier was belt ratting then i might just agree with that timing. if it's in an anomaly, then you have to at least double that, but you don't have to rat in a carrier.let's say i'm holding a cookie that i know has poison in it, but i don't know how much, so it could either do nothing, make me ill, or kill me. if i choose to eat the cookie, then i don't get to say that holding the cookie is inherently risky, because i have chosen to accept the risk of death in favour of the reward of cookie tastiness. in the same way, if you choose to run anomalies in one of the slowest and biggest ships in the game, then you choose to accept increased risk for increased reward, but that doesn't make ratting inherently risky.and let's not forget what you just said hereratting in unsafe spacein a carrieris relatively safein a carrier!!the most risky way of ratting in the most unsafe of environments is still basically safe.anyone who thinks that's a reasonable statement had better get used to wearing their underpants on their heads, sticking pencils up their noses and saying ""wibble"" because they've clearly gone quite mad.so given that we're agreed that ratting in nullsec is inherently 100% safe if one takes reasonable steps to mitigate risk for decreased reward, let's see how the two behaviours stack up in comparison.afk cloaking with localdoesn't make moneydoesn't give inteldoesn't give killsscares ratters into hiding so they can't make moneyhas no riskratting with localmakes moneygives intelhas no riskclearly ratting with local gives the most reward for no risk.now let's see what happens if we remove localafk cloaking without localdoesn't make moneydoesn't give inteldoesn't give killsdoesn't stop ratters rattingfunctionally identical to logging off100% waste of timeafk cloaking problem solved.non-afk cloakingno change to cloaking behaviour for active pilotsgreat success!ratting without localcan't use botsnot risk freeencourages co-operationrisk free ratting problem solved.botting problem solved.so i'm happy because you have risk in ratting, and you're happy because afk cloakers can't stop you making isk. everyone is happy."
5/26/2011,"now you told the truf you not going for pvp but jsut for kiling ratters that not pvp, ratter even dont have achence agens pvp ship (to difrent setups). that caled cheap killing and ganking."
5/26/2011,"and i keep telling you that it's fine if you want to subvert local. and i keep telling you i'm ok with you making local inaccurate intel. and i keep telling you my problem is with you being able to do these things while you can go to sleep without risk to you. if ccp were to change the mechanics so that you could still do those things, but now you had to work together as a team with your friends (taking turns) to disrupt local, the rules that you expect should apply to your targets now also apply to you. but that isn't what you want. and that, sir, is the truth.which doesn't alter the fact that afk cloakers are in 0.0 executing their professions risk-free. saying that these are ""just feelings"" isn't making them not true. i guess this is your new defense .i'm arguing that all professions in 0.0 should be exposed to risk and your response is that ""this is an emotional response"". this actually proves that you know you can't defend your position on this issue.ok.because it's ""human nature"" doesn't make it right and it doesn't make it a valid point. afk cloakers are still without risk. saying that keeping afk cloaking is good because it gets rid of bots is quite naive and ignorant. there is absolutely no consideration made on how it affects everyone else. that's because the arguments i've seen from your camp mostly ebenfit from this inbalance and don't want it seen removed.and why exactly are you opposed to adding risk to afk cloakers? as i've already stated, cloakers would still be able to project the fear and threats they already project. the only difference is now they would have to work in a team to keep ""subverting local"" and they would need to actually be awake. but these are things that already are expected from your targets. let me guess, ""these are just emotions"" .i think if you keep repeating this it will come true... c/d?"
5/26/2011,"my eyes! the goggles! they do nothing!!! last i checked, ganking was a part of this game. i believe ccp soundwave said as much to try and stem the tears over the jb changes."
5/26/2011,fleets of cloak disruption alts?not supported
5/26/2011,"the entire point of gaining sovernty over a chunk of space is so that you can rat with relative saftey. ccp has designed the game so that it is playable for the average player, that means having a level of security while in the space you have worked hard to win. even with this security, that is supposed to be earned though the hard work of taking space, it is still possible for you to lose your ship. it is made much harder for the enemy since they are in your space but it is still completely possible. a cloaked ship on the other hand can sit in hostile space for as long as they want with absolutely no threat to them what so ever. thats akin to me jumping my carrier into your space and being able to rat without being worried about losing my ship. its a flawed mechanic and needs to be fixed.your claim that ratting, in any ship, has no risk is incorrect and there for your entire argument is wrong."
5/26/2011,"no it really isn't. look up the posts of any of ccp on the matter (especially soundwave in the hilarious jb tears thread) and that much is certain. security is provided by your alliance, not by the space you hold. if you're approaching this from that viewpoint then your entire argument rests on a false assumption.it is possible that an out of control driver will hit me as i cross the road, but everyone would accept that as long as i took all reasonable precautions, i am not in any danger on any given crossing of the road. if you take reasonable precautions whilst ratting (checking local, being aligned to your safe / pos / station etc) then by the same measure you are not in any danger whilst ratting. thus is your assertion disproved.if you found a quiet system, it wouldn't matter who owned it. you jump in whilst no-one's there and have a cyno pilot always at the ready in case of emergency. you fit a cloak and you churn through anomalies whilst keeping an eye on local - all the while aligned to your bookmark (a trivially easy thing to accomplish). at the first sign of people in local you (optionally - you're in a carrier) pull in your drones and warp to your safe and cloak. if they try and camp you into the system you can either wait out your aggression and log, or simply jump to safety when your capacitor permits. it is utterly unarguable that the default state of ratting in 0.0 is risk free. it is only by consciously taking risks (by not aligning, or by not paying attention to local) that risk is injected. no-one would say ""crossing the road is risky because i might do it whilst wearing a blindfold"". assertion disproved, and my point stands."
5/26/2011,"well it's normal practise on a forum, to quote someone you are replying too. i find it strange you don't understand that, but if you missed it, he was in fact directing that post at me. local is broken, as can been seen by all the afk threads.i actually like the status quo, but i don't want a cloak nerf that doesn't come in a package with a local nerf. that is a balanced approach and the truth. yes emotional, you need to be more balanced.oh i can argue my position quite well on this. if you remove afk cloaking, you'll gain even more intel power. that's not good balance, and makes null sec ratting almost risk free.it leads me to believe it's an emotional response, because of your aversion to losing local intel chat and only aiming to nerf the effect instead of the cause.cool.you're assuming i think human nature is always right. it's been shown many times to be a bad thing. but it is what it is in regards to the forums and botting. if any change happens, i want it to be balanced for both sides, your camp only wants it one way.not balanced and not factual, so yes it looks emotional. calm down then."
5/26/2011,repeating this over and over again does not make it true or even invalidate the facts. at this point your responses have simply degenerated to irrelevant ad hominem attacks.
5/26/2011,"i think skill management via eve-gate is already on ccp's to-do list, iirchowever, the idea of a ""blank skill"" would probably gain more traction if it were an automatic kind of thing... how many times have you heard (maybe yourself?) say something to the effect of, ""aaargh! my skill queue ran out x hours ago! i'll never get that time back! aargh!"" so lets take a combo of the ideas above and make it so sp's accrue at a character's slowest possible rate whenever there aren't any other skills on the queue? or ?"
5/26/2011,"hearing a lot of crap about let's make gallente better, mostly about hybrid guns. well here's my five minutes of effort and look of disgust that you can't be happy with what you have.i fly all races with every tech ii gun so don't even bring up me being an amarr fanboy."
5/26/2011,"you forgot the effect of armor rigs on amarr and gallente ships, you also forgot to add an mwd to show its effect on cap.fact is, your amarr ship has 42% more range than the gallente ship, hits hard for 15km as opposed to 4.5km, and is only marginally slower than the gallente ships. you also fail to show that the hyperion is using 86% of its grid while the abaddon is using only 75%gallente ships have **** poor optimal, horrible fall off, and need to be hull to hull to deal the damage that an amarr can do at max web range (from your example)."
5/26/2011,i think its pretty fair. rail guns should be boosted though!
5/26/2011,"i'm going to provide a rebuttal in order of what you have said;my amarr ship uses 100% more capacitor and about 15% less damage and 20% less tracking, to make up for the range. also if you look at the chart the hyperion can do damage up to overheat web range, good damage if you know how falloff works. while the abaddon has more power it's only to supplement it's extra low slot, i was comparing guns not ships so this shouldn't be an issue.gallente ships do have **** poor optimal, but amarr ships have **** poor fall off. hybrid fall off is the second greatest in eve of the three turret weapons. hull to hull combat is common and if you're out of point range then the battleship is nothing but support, which is what amarr battleships are mainly used for because of their lack of medium slots for tackle."
5/26/2011,"<sigh> another one of these. you realize of course that with those dps numbers, unless the hyperion starts out 5km away the abaddon will outdamage it in all situations? and the huge range the abaddon has means it has to mwd around (if at all) a lot less. the less tracking is irrelevant when you need a quarter the tracking to hit the same size target at 15km as opposed to 4.5km.and what happens when the target is 45 km away? the abaddon keeps pewpewing at a healthy 730 dps. hyperion's dealing with huge falloff, dealing sub-50 dps. with null. and even if it does manage to mwd all the way to optimal, what kind of advantage do using those short range blasters get you? i bet it takes at least several minutes before you even match the abaddon's damage. really, except for those fights that start at 5km and the enemy never tries to escape, jam you, is dualprop, etc, you're much better off with lasers or autocannons in all situations"
5/26/2011,"yes. furthermore, the abaddon has more base powergrid. this is very important when considering the fitting of non race-exclusive modules.if the abaddon used 75% of its pg it could fit 16x 1600mm rolled tungsten plates.if the hyperion used 75% of its pg then it could only fit 10x 1600mm rolled tungsten plates.so gallente lose by using a greater % of the pg and by having less pg overall."
5/26/2011,what the hell kind of ship has 16 low slots for those plates?
5/26/2011,"i, too, fly ships fitted only with guns and damage mods."
5/26/2011,"i too, ignore that the long range ammo of amarr provides a much larger boost to range that that of gallente (same for minnie vs gallente)."
5/26/2011,try again.-5/10
5/26/2011,this.
5/26/2011,"<3 cr abaddon and the hyperion is rather lol worthy.you forgot to compare tanks as well. the baddon is a monster in close-range fights. no other non-faction, non-t2 bs comes close."
5/26/2011,"i believe a triple or dual rep hype would kill the abaddon, having said that so would a dual rep domi and maybe even a neut phoon. that aside op, blasters on the large scale only work if you start inside range, if you have to mwd anywhere then pretty much every other cr bs weapon pulls ahead."
5/26/2011,"1v1 (which rarely happens), and the hyperion magically dictates range... sure. but, given the choice in eve, i'd rather be in the baddon because in almost all circumstances, i'll be on the winning side."
5/26/2011,"blasters are already overpowered, that's why i'm using them now."
5/26/2011,"so, where are all the hyperion blobs? as it's clearly the superior ship."
5/26/2011,"well yeah, me too. i took you saying close range as within scram range obviously if it starts anywhere but scram the baddon wipes the floor with them"
5/26/2011,"i like something similar that could also reduce a little of the server load and the chat problem:instead of limiting just the trial accounts, reduce the text limit for everyone in the local chat of every system, and increase the time penalty between posts. all other conversation windows would have less strict controls.when a system starts to lag, start blocking trial accounts from entering before paying accounts -- in fact, i'd consider blocking trial accounts from entering trade hubs and all heavily loaded systems altogether. there would be little point in an alternate trade hub springing up elsewhere then. there are roughly 1000 market manipulation alts in jita 23.5/7, and that will be true of wherever becomes market #1.perhaps when the time dilation proposed by ccp is getting to ridiculous levels in a particular system, stop trial accounts from stressing that node altogether by not allowing them to log into or jump into systems on that node.i'm not in favour of restrictions applied to accounts by age limit."
5/26/2011,"the alts are the real problem here people. they offer something that eve is not suppose to have, true isk for zero risk. they use these throw away alts and trials and never leave their port which makes them impossible to get any kind of revenge against."
5/26/2011,do not support. makes local discussion impossible for true new players.
5/26/2011,"scamming by being smart is part of the game, should scamming by spamming a ****load, often enough using bots, really be part of the game? if yes, give us what is needed so we can make an ingame spam filter..."
5/26/2011,"simple.suspend or ban people that spam chats. and perma ban those who use bots to spam chat.i like scamming, stupid people should lose money. but if the same 3 people say the same things 20000 times an hour there is an issue."
5/26/2011,"right-click, block. honestly, it's not that hard, trade hub locals for me are pretty much silent."
5/26/2011,"ok i know this has been implemented for sometime but i just dont get it.massive whine about nano (which yes was justified). so ccp do a complete speed rebalance - great no problemthen further feed the whines by adding the mwd feature to scrams - why?!! you already rebalanced the speed of ships!scrams do not have a long range, so your making ships that supposed to be fast useless, like say inties. why would you ever put an ab on a ceptor? ceptors also have short range so you have to pretty much get in scram range to hit anything, the speed tank is whats key for a ceptor.however most people now fit a scram rather than a disrupter! so your making ceptors be long range and thats not good either, im talking about ceptors but this applies to other ships too.you have a webifier to slow down ships. remove the mwd killer and add extra range to the webifier, perhaps like a warp disrupter."
5/26/2011,"you can't have much experience in small hull combat if you think mwd killing scrams are a bad thing.frigates are more than fast enough to live long prosperous lives inside scram range without a prop mod, interceptors even more so.the threat to smalls comes from drones and neuts more than anything else .. scram on the other goes both ways and allows you to stop most ship in their tracks.ps: ab ceptors are stupidly good fun to fly .. best damn kick in the adrenal gland eve has to offer"
5/26/2011,"ceptors work perfectly fine inside scram range (claw, taranis and 'sader come to mind) mwds switching off scrams only effect the tracking on blasters really as they no longer have the sig bloom of mwds to help with their tracking."
5/26/2011,do you even play this game? how many ppl either fit a small neut or have warriors or both? any decent player has one or both...and as stated this wasnt just about ceptors.
5/26/2011,"as an inty and af pilot, i routinely take on canes, vagas, rapiers, etc... solo... the ability to shut down their mwd is extremely important to maintaining high transversal as i kill them under their guns. before scrams shut down mwd's, webs applied a 90% speed penalty... and while that might sound good to you, it would make ab's obsolete. additionally, it would make outracing a gun's tracking virtually impossible if the enemy has a single web. i don't think you know what your asking. currently, ab, mwd vs scram, web, pt are well balanced. so stop whining that you have to make a choice at the fitting screen!"
5/26/2011,"so much fail in one post, amayzing.you really don't have a clue about small ships pvp, learn to play eve."
5/26/2011,"do you? there are frigates that can tank warriors with ease and a small neut wouldnt bother. also you cant speed tank with an mwd on anyway, a normal frigate with its mwd on has the sig of a cruiser without it."
5/26/2011,agreed!
5/26/2011,i still have my 2 attribute points.i just didn't remapnow i'm at -2 unassigned attribute points which brings me at a grand total of 121 attribute points instead of the 119 you guy's havethis makes me specialand i like being specialfor the same reason i have 3 neural remaps available if i can ever be botherd to use themplease visit your user settings to re-enable images.
5/26/2011,"the reason they are afk is not the issue, it is their ability to go afk that is the problem. there needs to be some mechanic that forces a cloaked ship to continue to need input from the player. be that directly relating to the cloak, or because of the ability of other players to eventually find said cloaked ship. there is no reason that a ship once cloaked no longer needs any input from the player. that like having a mining barge that can simply start mining and never have to unload cargo and that is not able to be shot."
5/26/2011,"the 'power of local' can still be subverted with this proposal, only that you'd have to actually be in front of your computer screen to stay alive."
5/26/2011,can ccp just make it a bannable offense to start a thread about afk cloaking already?
5/26/2011,no that would be what ratting in nullsec currently is - 100% risk free way of making isk. afk cloaking does nothing except stop those pilots unwilling to take any risk from making isk. both issues can be solved by removing local.
5/26/2011,"they can gather intel just fine bob by using the scanner, the only number they are barred from is total local counts which is moot in station systems due to docked afk's anyway.since ccp doesn't like the fact that ships can be made unprobeable, why not combine it with a cloak nerf/fix? (which both ccp and players are divided on):- cloaked ships can be scanned down using combat probes just like all other ships.civilian cloaks (non covert): -10 to -12% (faction) signature per level of cloaking.military cloaks (covert): -15% signature per level of cloaking.* all covert using ships should have sensors/sigs tweaked to allow for unprobeable status (ie. with all influencing skills at 4-5).-black ops have base signatures cut 50-60% (ie. bs with sigs lower than bcs!). gives them a reason to go out roaming with their portal clients -> sub-bc size with bs damage and commandship ehp.- unprobeable setups (ccp doesn't like them either) nerfed through probe mechanic/module tweaks). includes t3s, they should need cloaks to be 'invulnerable'.solves cloaking macro ravens, grief cloaking using non-coverts, cloaking bbs et al. can still semi-function as now if all lows are used for arrays and implants are used but that is gimpage galore so a fair trade, much better balanced than the single mid (sebo) needed to alleviate drawback currently.edit: also acts a nerf to super-capitals using cloaks as ""get out of jail free"" cards thus forcing them to actually need support fleets or at the very least buddies (intended as alliance level assets, remember? )."
5/26/2011,"ah, now let's not mix the two issues here because they're very different. unprobable != cloaked, and shouldn't be treated the same. it's true that up ships that are point and bubble immune whilst providing good gang links are overpowered for the risk of loss they represent. cloaking is not that though. there is a clear mandate for stealth within the game, and a clear nerf that said stealth provides - namely the inability to do anything whilst cloaked except warp from a to b (if you have the right ship for the job). i don't know what the solution to unprobable ships is, but cloaking ships are supposed to be impossible to find. i remember the bad old days when the saying of the day was ""nothing says stealth like 'oh look! a stealth bomber!""the issue really is that ratters take exception to the power of an afk cloaked ship to force them to make the assumption that they're not afk. removing local solves this.there is another issue whereby ratters by their own admission are 100% safe whilst ratting in nullsec whilst they have local. removing local solves this too.there is even a third issue, inasmuch as a certain number of pilots use bots to rat that warp off as soon as another entity pings up in local, thus preserving their violation of the eula in 100% safety. removing local solves this too.the issue i have is that people are trying to fix the first problem whilst trying to maintain the ability to rat in nullsec in complete safety, which is what all of these afk cloaking threads perpetuate. would it be harder to solo rat in a nullsec with no local - you bet your bottom dollar it would! eve is not a solo game. you can't have a foolish blob of one..."
5/26/2011,"ratting is not 100% risk free. your logic is flawed and your argument is not credible. ratting is low risk, but it is far from risk free. local could probably use some tweeking, but that is a different topic. regardless of how afk cloaking is being used, the fact that you can cloak and then go afk is the issue. cloaking should have a way to be combated that allows the cloaked ship to be found if they are afk. if i were afk mining or ratting (without a bot that is) i would be an easy target, cloaked ships that are afk should be easy targets as well. no one is arguing the boting is ok, and ccp is working very hard to combat it."
5/26/2011,"not enough 'ever' in that reply, a few more would have nailed it.i'm glad you think a few d-scans would sort it, but it still doesn't escape the fact that local is behind it.removing local wouldn't make afk cloaking less common, it would stop it being the psych tool it presently is. it would then become a pointless exercise and you know it.so now you're not interest in fixing the cause, only the effect. in other words, afk is merely a red herring, you simply want to nerf cloaks. it seemingly doesn't matter to you, that the facts point to your reliance upon local's instant intel as being the problem.you want to nerf cloaks, no matter what. you want your 100%, risk free, instant intel tool, to be all powerful again. i'm glad you think that's a balanced approach, personally, i don't."
5/26/2011,"then you need to increase your calorie intake my dear they are not the same, but they are related. both provide the user with invulnerability which has been a big no-no in eve for a long time and prompted speed revamp, ecm revamp and just about every other major 'nerf' since eve launched.personally don't give a rats arse about afk cloaks, what i do think breaks the game is ships not meant for cloaking abusing them to maintain permanent eyes on an area and super-capitals being able to be used for hit'n'run attacks (think about it, it is beyond ridiculous).up ships and cynos/hot-drops will be nerfed soon if the dev answer thread is accurate, which leaves just cloaking as the last unscoutable/invulnerable 'tactic' .. how long do you think that last vestige of pre-dawn eve will survive?i consider it inevitable and would rather help cook up a system that leaves them a niche to frolic in (knowing ccps ability to obsolete entire sectors with poorly thought out changes) .. hence my previous post.as for 'no local' being the answer to everything: - human ratters will disappear almost completely and will be replaced with macros that intercepts traffic to/from server providing near perfect intel on occupants regardless of what client shows (or was that patched out after the monkeysphere thingie?). +1 automation/botting.- mining in null will never ever be revived which kills any hope of cutting the jita umbilical, thus favouring the uber-blobs with spare titan's for logistics.- scan button will be molested 23/7 by everyone.- scouting becomes obsolete in most areas as long as filtering of results is not more detailed. all systems have pos's and most are used as parking lots.it breaks far more than it solves if done without serious changes mainly to intel gathering (ie. scanning/probing). it works for worms because access is severely limited so you don't have 3-4 roams running around every day (or more depending on area)."
5/26/2011,what i just don't get is that an aggressor in high sec gets paid out by insurance! concord should not only pop him but take isk from his account to pay for his suicide ganking activities!that way if you want to make a statement by ganking then you will know that it will cost you!!the insurance system leaves a lot to be desired and really needs tweaking!

5/26/2011,"as a person who reads far above an eight grade level, this is an excellent approach for reaching the intellectual minority of eve, and i support it. however, being that most of the eve community prefer their issues posted as single sentences (tl;dr) or bulleted lists, i think few people would actually bother to read a purposefully and intelligently crafted white paper. however, these apprehensions shouldn't prevent anyone from publishing white papers. those of us who care will read them.additionally, i do not think that giving 'oversight' of an approval/disapproval power of white paper publishing to the csm is a good idea, especially with someone such as the mittani as the chairman, since he would most likely refer to authors as '******s'.any such oversight should be granted to a body of intelligent and competent individuals, and it be a good idea to only allow participation through peer review. for example, a board member might recommend a potential future board member, and the group reviews his/her competency, and either chooses to allow or deny his/her entry."
5/26/2011,"here's my thought on thatit's a nice idea in theory, but there's a reason why the maxim goes ""in theory theory should be like practice, but in practice this is rarely the case"". there are too many vested interests (the needs of pvp'ers vs the desire of the carebear for instance) to have just one of these, and with egos and politics you'd either end up with a divided committee or ccp having to take account of the 3rd minutes of the 14th subcommittee meeting on paper x before responding to it as an idea."
5/26/2011,"there is no fair voting mechanism, although i do believe the fairest is based on a hybrid bicameral system, tailored for eve. one group of elected persons based on population, and another based on region.why do you need both? i will briefly explain.first of all if you based representation purely off population, those areas with a higher population would be provided with more representation and therefore have more influence. secondly, if you base representation purely off region, then those areas with less population, receive equal representation as those areas that have higher populations, and thus the higher populated areas receive less influence than they deserve.therefore, in order to balance this dichotomic predicament, you must have both. image the followingthe first group in this system would consist of one seat chosen from each major region (highsec, lowsec, nullsec, wormhole space, or perhaps geographically such as north, south, east, and west). this would provide 4 seats.the second group is comprised of a number of persons determined by population from each of the previously mentioned major groups.lets propose one seat for every 100,000 inhabitants, and assuming that eve has roughly 690,000 [eve qen q1 2011, page 10] characters, that provides 6 seats. each major area would be granted a certain number of seats based on its population. given that population rises, falls, and that players move around, seats could and most probably will change hands. however each major region would always have at least 1 seat.the hybrid aspect of this is that all of these officials reside in the same body, as opposed to an actual bicameral system, wherein they would be in separate bodies.so, with this system, we have a minimum of 8 seats, and a maximum of 10 seats (roughly the same as the current csm), with a smaller portion chosen via region, and the remainder chosen via population, providing a system that is fairer than the current one.and as for the chairman and vice-chairman, why not let the elected officials choose them after each election. i also think the idea of term-limits should be addressed as well.if you wish to comment on this thats excellent, however make your comments or critiques with intelligence, and please dont make stupid, sarcastic, or childish remarks."
5/26/2011,"to be a ""care bear"" more often than not requires a special type of person as does a fighter pilot!what really needs to happen is this:only a ""care bear"" can manufacture and mine above level 1 and his toon only fight to level 1.only a ""pvp"" toon can fight above level 1 and only manufacture and mine to a level 1.this way there will be more respect for both groups, and game play more balanced!you want that big assed ship? ... then befriend a carebear otherwise you aint gonna get it!!if you look at most online games where you need to manufacture and mine, you will find a special charachter in game that does it...not everyone!all carebears should go on strike for a month and let's see what happens lol !!what would this mean for ccp? more active accounts !!"

5/26/2011,"my policy with summit minutes -- which i am encouraging my colleagues to adopt -- is to put as much into them as possible, then edit them as needed if participants express concerns (like nda).so the draft of ccp sreegs presentation (aka ""sreegs team six - the war on bots"") is 1100 words for a 30 minute session.ps: +1 to two step for two-stepping up and taking on the minutes prep for a couple of sessions, even though he wasn't at the summit."

5/26/2011,"i like this idea, however i feel that players should only be able to choose one region (or system) of residence in which they would be eligible to cast a vote for their mayor (i think governor is more apt than mayor, but that's just my opinion). or perhaps limit players to a single vote in only one region, regardless of other factors. it makes no sense to allow for players to vote repeatedly, and by allowing a system wherein a player's clone location determines their residence would allow that, call it vote spamming if you will.although, there is at least one drawback to this... block voting. by creating this system, it would ipso facto allow nullsec uber-alliances to also control highsec and nullsec, to a certain degree. i don't know if that would be desirable to the eve community at large."
5/26/2011,"it wasn't leaked, it was decompiled which is possible since eve is based on python. besides only 50% or so can be decompiled and it's only the client not the server. besides this is hardly news, how do you think bots have been built earlier before this ""leaked source code""?"

5/26/2011,"dreads are only good at shooting towers and stations, and even then they are still second choice. to make them first choice by only nerfing scarriers would be a hefty nerf. scarriers need a bit of a nerf, but dreads need some pretty substantial buffing after all the multiple beatings they've had with the nerf stick.1. they need more buffer.2. they need to do more damage.3. they need a shorter siege timer.4. they need a reduction to the tracking debuff when going into siege so they can actually hit other caps."
5/26/2011,"i think what he's getting at, is that for turrets you need to have all three(small,medium, large) to 5 before you can use tech 2 large turrets, as opposed to t2 launchers where you only need the specific missile size trained to use the t2. siege missile launcher ii'smissile launcher operation iv torpedo specialization i torpedoes v heavy missiles iii standard missiles iii 1400mm arty ii'ssharpshooter v medium artillery specialization iv small artillery specialization iv small projectile turret v medium projectile turret v large projectile turret v gunnery v thats a real big difference.edit: nevermind, op is full of whine."
5/26/2011,"maybe, but that doesn't mean he does not have a point.i would be against any directly applicable skills being reduced, or prereqs being removed entirely. the thing is, the small and medium turrets are not directly applicable. i think level 4 as pre reqs or even 3 to bring them into line with launchers is not only very reasonable, it's fair.there are a lot of skill requirements in this game that could be adjusted. the most prominent example i can think of is the mining barge to exhumer progression. you are in the covetor for about a day before you qualify for a hulk. it really minimizes the usefullness of the covetor."

5/27/2011,"i think my take on poses are a bit diffrent than most... and i would assume the most unlikely thing to happen, but i will give it a go anyway.i would like to see that people can dock at poses.pos owner can give docking permissions to whoever they like, and also assign personal space (ship/storage space) and permissions to those docked in the pos. that means that you can give permissions to anyone you like, regardless of corp, alliance or otherwise.everyone have their own hangar just like an outpostpos services like research, labs, guns and so on are all accessable from inside of the pos.adding pos modules expand what you can do with the pos. for example adding a sma extends the total amount of m3 that can dock, adding a cha allows more stuff to be stored). adding labs/refinerys/whatever allows you to perform that function. the only difference is really guns. adding guns is also done from inside the pos, but can then be placed outside the pos shield. accessing the guns will also give an outside view of the pos.the poses should still have all the restrictions they do now, so you may have to pick and choose which mods are active, but it is done from within."

5/27/2011,"crossposting a collection of good points in favor of making cq optional:preface: i am not afraid of change. i have been looking forward to incarna ever since it was first mentioned, before it even became known as wis or ambulation. what i am afraid of is a loss of immersion, which would be tragic as an effect of an expansion meant to increase immersion, and the high likelihood (at this point) that cq will not live up to its potential simply because ccp is being stubborn and blinded by their excitement.quoted for justice.a capsuleer doesn't eject their pod from their ship and get out of their pod every time they dock. some capsuleers probably stay in their pods 99% of the time. the following options must be implemented:[ ] always show hangar when docking.[ ] always show quarters when docking.[ ] prompt to choose between hangar and quarters.the purpose of incarna is enhancement of immersion. as a roleplayer, i foresee it damaging immersion if it is not made optional. capsuleers do not get out of their pods every single time they dock. there are very few aspects of eve's game mechanics that an immersionist has to ""filter out"" in order to maintain their immersion; ccp should not add another thing like that, especially when doing so would be ridiculously contrary to their own stated purposes and the solution is both utterly simple and completely harmless."

5/27/2011,fail i think comes with own alliance doesnt it?and yes salvage is fine ppl dont care about salvage - this is about loot!! why dont you read properly? or are you incapable?look the simple fact is everyone else who gets agression cant dock so why can ninja looters? answer the bloody question rather than trolling like an attention seeking idiot?the simple fact is they should get a docking timer...fact - unless you can come up with a valid argument against
5/27/2011,"simple fix; move systems, or ignore them.or, bring some corp mates along to your mission and kill them there.just because you're incompetant and didn't think of anything other then shooting them on a station, in dock range, doesn't mean you can't kill them."

5/27/2011,"oh look, it's this thread again.ccp have repeatedly stated wrecks do not belong to anyone, and salvage is supposed to be a competitive business. loot belongs to the mission runner, and you're more than welcome to shoot at anyone who steals from you. your work is in shooting the targets, but you get gifted the location. a ninja's work is in scanning down the location, but they get gifted the targets. you do just as much ""work"" as we do."

5/27/2011,1. acquire friend2. acquire noctis/ thread
5/27/2011,"i said they do as much ""work"" as mission runners. i'm not arguing either is particularly taxing.getting agression from shooting at someone is very different from nicking something. it makes sense that stations would not want to admit pilots who had recently engaged in acts of agression against others. it also makes sense that they'd want to keep an eye on firefights going on in their system, and who was involved. why would they care about random acts of petty larceny? how would they even know most of them had occurred outside of he-said-she-said type exchanges?i'm not saying internet spaceships should be hyper-realistic or anything, just that the rules remain open and logical. please stop trying to defecate in my sandbox."
5/27/2011,they should not be able to insta dock. an agression timer is perfectly reasonable..........even though the ninja looters will quickly adapt and the issue become moot. i mean...what are they going to do? run back to a station so they can sit outside like a duck in a shooting gallery while waiting for a timer to let them dock?-windjammer
5/27/2011,"no skill remaps ever.the general argument for a single remap would maybe apply to a new player who needs a quick shift in skills to enjoy the game...but that undermines the whole foundation of eve's gameplay to begin with. no skill is useless for starters. secondly, a single remap would be limited to 60 days from creation of the character - thus only new characters could take advantage of it for its intended reason.as was said earlier, you're just trying to get your foot in the door with a simple idea of one remap. again, eve's entire foundation is built on the skill-system and its permanence. by allowing skill remaps you significantly reduce the lifespan of the game - i.e. people will quit earlier from boredom because they experience too much of the game too quickly. while this wouldn't necessarily affect a 2+ year character who has already seen most of what the game will offer (the rest being the sandbox experience), this change could have disastrous consequences on new player recruitment.new players are fickle - what sells eve is the hardcore gameplay of 'when you lose it, it's gone' and the skill system that paces the game: getting to even a tech i battleship is an achievement for everyone. most people have battleships, but what makes it an achievement is that you spent the time to get there (and the isk). if you remove the pacing of the skill system, you remove the sense of accomplishment that eve provides, and most games don't. it's a big deal when you get that first capital - partially because of cost (lots of effort for most) but also the amount of time it took to get there. this is the eve experience - an experience tailored to your goals and aspirations, not a structured system of point a to point b that can be 'redone' at a whim.tl;dr remapping of skills would destroy eve gameplay and should never be considered. all skills are useful, so you can only get better with time: thus, if you messed up your skills: tough and start learning the right ones. from day 1 you're able to make isk and get things done, so you can't say your skills are so wrong you're useless."
5/27/2011,how about a remap big enough for players to leave the fail gallente behind
5/27/2011,pandora box.no.

5/27/2011,"stop. whining.ohlook, i fixed the problem for you ccp."
5/27/2011,"1. i don't think i understand the problem you're trying to fix. how does neut rr create risk free pvp? iirc in high sec if you rr someone with aggression you can be shot by anyone who can shoot the ships you rr.2. this fix seems pretty heavy handed, do you realize what this would do to faction warfare and coalitions if you can only rr people in your own alliance? this would make mixed fleets and large battles almost impossible."
5/27/2011,"i'd not say 'risk free' but it does create an off-balance, 10 man corp a decs 10 man corp b. all fair and sexycorp a has another 10 men which remain neutral and provide rr creating a 20m vs 10m situation and corp b can do little to counter.. except maybe get 10 neutral rr of their own, but then we end up in stalemate yawn-fest where every mofo has a neutral rr and nobody can kill anybodyi agree rr is a little wrong and needs addressing in some wayand while the argument 'huurrr deerr but you can shoot them' is valid, its a bit moot as then the war no longer becomes about shooting your wartargets.i would agree that rr need be in corp/alliance (ie, they have to present a valid target / take risk of engagement); but its a very harsh way to solve an issue like this.i would appreciate others input on neutral rr as well."
5/27/2011,"ok, so how is this situation different than corp a just having 20 members, of which 10 fly rr ships (or 10 rr mercenary pilots joining the corp after the war dec starts)? the only difference i see is that you can't shoot the rr ships until after they start repping instead of any time you see them, and i'm not sure why that would make a big difference.i'm against this far reaching proposal, but there might be a better narrowly tailored solution if it was clear exactly what the problem is."

5/27/2011,neutral rr and blobs. the only solo pvp to be had is with your wife. welcome to eve.
5/27/2011,"this is the only logical argument you have made against this proposal, and i refuted it when i pointed out that even with this new module you can still afk in any unprobable ship. thus this proposal would not make local infallible and you can still afk 23/7 to gather intel, or whatever you like doing there."
5/27/2011,if you can still afk for 23/7 then what is the point of your change? surely it does nothing to stop the whole afk process and just nerfs people using their cloaks for other things
5/27/2011,"well you've shouted, (posting words in all capitals) lied about what i've said, as well as ranted about demands and what you keep telling me. is it any wonder, i consider you somewhat emotional?it's not all that serious tbh and it's fine if you feel you can't continue the argument."
5/27/2011,"the point is that afking is a bit more difficult since making ships unprobable is harder than throwing on a cloak. if the security of the system is paramount for a short time, then someone could probe the general location of the suspected afk and watch for them to warp away. so it does improved security by a small amount, and i do understand that some people want far less security everywhere (which is a valid viewpoint, but i think they should just disagree and go on instead of calling everyone whiny carebears who can't read and only alt post. why i still hope for any manners from poasters on the intertubes is a good question, though)as it is now cloaking is near invincibility, i can cloak 100k off the biggest battle in eve and take a shower, go to work, have dinner, and screw my girlfriend with an infinitesimal chance of being detected. i see that as a problem, but i don't want uncloaking to be fast, riskless, or free, so this is the best solution i thought up (perhaps there's a better one out there).this isn't the biggest problem in all of eve and if the csm and the devs think it's better the way it is or it's too much work to add i can accept that, but i think the game would be improved with this addition."
5/27/2011,and can not do a god damned thing.
5/27/2011,"by the same token i could go afk in an unprobable cyno stiletto in a safe with my mwd on and never be found, doing all the activities you just mentioned outside of game. mind you i wouldnt be able to do anything in game same as if i was cloaked."
5/27/2011,"except they can and they do. there's a reason afk cloaking is effective. while an afk cloaker can rest and sleep even, he is able to wear down the system locals keeping them vigilant 24/7 (as it should be, might i add). but no one or anything is able to bring the same projected threat to the cloaker. the only way to catch a cloaker is to set up a trap and pray to god that he is brainless enough to accept and fall into it. basically, the cloaker has to agree to pvp in order to bring pvp to him, all this in the middle of 0.0 where it's supposed to be ""dangerous""."
5/27/2011,"most folk looking at this, view this in a mechanical prospective, and notices nothing wrong with it, and sees it working as intended. as i and others do.the ones that can not (or refuse to) see it that way, are too busy hand wringing and posting threads like this because the boogie man is fcking with their head. the folks bent about nerfing the afk menace are trying to change a mechanic based out of pure emotional distress. in which is self created."
5/27/2011,speaking of emotional...
5/27/2011,"yep, frothing at the very thought."
5/27/2011,"no, you couldn't - you would easily be detectable, especially with the mwd on. whether anyone could ever catch you is a very different matter, and ccp has been playing with speed balance issues for years. there will always be some ship that's faster than any others, and i'm not sure if that's really a problem or not. really? perhaps you could post the numbers on this so we can see what 'most folk' really want. the vast majority of those i talk to (an admittedly small sample compared to the population of eve) want a change like this, a smaller number don't care either way, and a small minority oppose it violently and talk sht at anyone who holds any opposing opinion."
5/27/2011,well i suppose you can look at the vote count every time this topic comes up for support. and then you can make a note of how fast it goes down in flames.

5/27/2011,"i don't use eft, but the one thing i've just noticed there, is it quotes ""optimal"" as 4.5 + 13km...*ahem*(i'll let you figure that out for youself, you might actually learn something)"

5/27/2011,"troll rejected. i've made a personal point of never paying with real money for any game.if you even though about what you were saying before you said it you'd see that this thread is about blasters not the ships they are fitted on. most amarr laser ships spend a whole bonus on reducing cap usage, consider that.edit: also it takes a lot of guts to troll with an alt, kudos to you."
5/27/2011,"also i'm gonna abandon this post, it seems everyone who comes on assembly hall is all talk and really hasn't left high sec in a year/two.edit:they seem to believe that battleships one on one and ships don't need to stay close to eachother anyways to rr, thinking that the supreme range of lasers is completely op as if they could disrupt from 45km. to each ship and gun type their own, gallente have wrecking damage but without range, lasers have great range control and good damage but heavy capacitor consumption."
5/27/2011,"hey bro, you realize your thread is titled ""gallente boost unnecessary"" rite? you're bad. =)yes, clearly if people had left highsec they would know gallente dominate out there.... wait... they don't. still bad bro.yes because being close together to rr each other has alot to do with being in range to shoot peoples... oh... it doesn't? bad.but they can hit you from 45km, even if this were magical fairy land where only damage within disruptor range counts as you seem to believe... gallente still does worse. capacitor consumption means alot when you can easily fit a heavy cap booster... oh wait... it doesn't. so bad...this doesn't even touch on how akward gallente ships are at fitting, how trashy railguns are, and as has already been mentioned, 'where are these hyperion blobs you think are just as effective?', they don't seem to be anywhere. you seem incapable of realizing this is because gallente is outclassed. congratz professor baddie. o7you should also try evaluating ranges by something better then optimal+falloff (at which dps is about 30%), which is a terrible way to compare range, as you would know if you knew what you were talking about. if you take a look at optimal+(1/2)falloff (at which dps is about 80%) your poorly considered 25 'range' for pulse and 17.5 'range' for blasters which denotes the ranges at which neither weapon is actually effective it appears pulse have 43% more range, but that range comparison is useless, you're only doing 30% dps, durrr. a comparison of ranges for 80% dps gives 20 'range' for pulse and 11 'range' for blasters which shows a more meaningful difference of 82% greater range for pulse while doing 80% dps. that doesn't even count that tes grant greater benefits to lasers simply due to their range already being greater and that laser t2 ammo is far superior. you'd know all of this if you weren't so awful that you apparently never realized optimal is more valuable then falloff is. you're either troll or awful, take a pick."
5/27/2011,"just tired of managing my real life around the fact that if i don't log friday night i'll lose 8 hours of skillpoints, and that's if i wake up early the next morning.if people quit the game just stop the training time. if you pay, you train, 100% garanteed. if you want to push the dev around it, make the player select a category and if no skill is next in the list, train a random skill you own in selected category. that way you'll always train something, even if you got into a car accident and been in the coma for 5 weeks."
5/27/2011,"so log in thursday night, when your current skill dips under 24h, and set a long one so you're guaranteed training until you can log in and set the one you want.seriously, this is not hard."
5/27/2011,"change your training to another long skill so that your away time is covered until you can log on. if you're in a coma, i think amarr cruiser v is the least of your concerns"
5/27/2011,"in a game consisting almost entirely of longterm planning and spreadsheets... you find it shocking you're expected to consider your skill training times in advance? you have 24 hours of leeway, which is fine. it used to be none, which sucked lol."
5/27/2011,"if you don't feel like a slave to this system, maybe you should go out more. my point is, until your subscription runs out, you should have 100% training garanteed (unless you run out of skills to train). that won't break the game, it's not unfair to anyone and you might even feel a bit of a relief. what's not to like about this ?"
5/27/2011,"scams will always be a part of the eve universe. i'm pretty sure ccp wants it that way as just another example of the whole ""eve's a hard universe, htfu."" that being said, i find it improbable that there is no way to communicate or share scammer information that is a bit more user friendly to the average pilot. sort of like a new eden bbb (better business bureau)rating. i'd recommend a second 'public' rating for user interaction, similar to the existing standings indicator. it allows one value per user, updated maybe daily, so that when someone checks the user info, it has a reputation value, -10.0 to +10.0. since each player can only provide one rating on another player i'd be hard to abuse. you can check that before you deal with someone. this rating can mean that a particular pilot would honor a pod ransom or not, to whether or not to believe any business dealings, depending on the pilot's profession. a pilot screws over a corp, it gives them some way of warning others, meaning that the potential scammer needs to balance his actions..get some good ratings to balance the bad...maybe some ratings fall off after a period of time to represent someone 'laying low' to let the heat die down before their next scam."
5/27/2011,"scams are a part of eve...and nobody required you to look at local in jita. if you're not scamming or look for a fail scam (i have made a pretty isk or too off people that got their contract backwards...hehe), then just ignore local in jita. it's not like other games where the chat pane can't be minimized.as for lag...the spam in a text channel doesn't come close to the amount of lag that next freighter warping in, so no argument there.scams have been removed from new player systems for a reason - jita is a trade hub, where all forms of trade take place. it isn't as if when you dock your hangar bay fills with hawkers and giant text bubbles of contracts (i sure hope incarna will not allow this down the road, that would cause lag!)short of it is, just minimize local. it isn't like you were intending to have a conversation in it anyways. more importantly, unless ccp outlaws scams entirely (please don't i find them entertaining to watch when station trading) local will never be a truly viable source for the spamming of legitimate contracts - which is why you have a powerful contract search tool at your disposal, complete with no text box to deal with spam. what a thought! genius!"
5/27/2011,"seriously? im a bitter old vet and even i dont support this. scams are a part of eve and always have been. its one of the things which add realism to the game. its not like local chats are full of intellectual discussions anyway.i hate to use the phrase, if you dont like it, leave, but if you find yourself irritated by scams, you may have chosen the wrong game to play. eve is pvp and that goes well beyond simple pew pew pvp. the pvp in market, contracts and scams is just as real as the shooting variety of pvp and arguably responsible for more isk movement than destroyed ships.i dont care for scams and i dont hang with people that do, but i wont ignore the fact that scams are an important part of eve and the game would be less without them.-windjammer"
5/27/2011,"lets get on sisi and try this out shall we? so your saying that a neut and warriors do nothing? ok....yeah and other thing lets nerf even more by adding a damn sig nerf wtf - shall we just stop using mwd altogether then?plus im not talking just about ceptors, as usual ccp go overboard cos ppl whine the facts are1) ships got a speed rebalance anyway (why wasnt that good enough)2) mwds are not really viable anymore because almost everyone fits a scram3) soloing isnt really part of eve anymore, so your guaranteed gangs that one person as a scram one has a disrupter4) webifiers are there to slow ships down, so why have a scram thats inst stops a ship, just increase the range of webs5) then they add yet another nerf on mwd sig, so even if you have a mwd on a small ship, you get a massive sig and get insta locked6) your saying i should fit am ab on ceptor - really! its supposed to have a mwd! its a ceptor! again this inst just about ceptors.wtf!!! seriously!! talk about going overboard....unless you can give me a good argument on why this is here - i cant agree on why it should be there.."
5/27/2011,"scram: 9km, small neut: 6km .. that's a whopping 3km worth of leeway which is huge in the frigate realm.drones can be popped right quick if you know what you are doing and only pose a significant threat if there are ec-xxx mixed in which mess up smalls something fierce.you don't say .. guess that's why i use the terms ""smalls"" and ""small hull"" the ab interceptor 'ps' was added because you thumbed your nose at the idea which can only mean you have limited knowledge of the interceptor as a class.tremendous power in the ab combat inty against targets that otherwise eat them as snacks like the auto-thrasher.because it adds complexity. prior to qr everyone and their mother had 24km point and a 90% web, scrams were never ever used except by pirate campers targeting wcs haulers. the god web obsoleted frigates and most cruisers/bcs, you simply did not undock in anything but bs or nano-hacs .. boring is putting it mildly.fitting for combat today requires more than reading up on the latest fotm and allows for lots more variety than before, thanks in large part to qr's changes .. including the revised scrams."
5/27/2011,"thank you for a refreshing explanation. shame most people cant post like this.you have to remember, people do not fight 1v1 anymore, those times are past. this would be fine for 1v1s on another small hull but ppl fly in gangs, with webs, with warp disrupters, with medium neuts not small ones..you ceptor is smoke mate.."
5/27/2011,"i only mentioned ceptors in my original point as it was mentioned in the op, however i still stand that warriors arent that big of an issue to a decent frigate pilot and neuts can be overcome without too much trouble.i never mentioned adding a sig nerf, i was making a point that even if scrams didnt stop mwds you still wouldnt be able to use them to speed tank anything really due to the increased signature radius you get from using the mwd in the first place. although you didnt specifically mention ceptors in your op they are perfectly viable with abs, particularly the combat variants as they work best inside scram range for the most part anyway. the tackle ceptors shouldnt be entering scram range if they are being used for their role - i.e. tackling. as hiranda already pointed out having scrams no longer stop webs will make them pointless as a mod except for stopping stabbed ships, and having web range will do more to kill frigate chances against larger ships than the scram currently does.for example you approach a ship with your mwd on, making sure to keep your tranversal high enough, then the ship webs you from say 18km?? you slow down but your sig stays up, because you wont switch your mwd off straightaway, the opposing larger ships guns then have no problems tracking you from that distance and you pop.the scram/web changes when they came in really helped a frigates chances against larger opponents as the original 90% web combined with medium guns shredded frigates. however it did make blasters a bit lacklustre.having said all that i would love to have a pre-web changes armor cane now, dual 90% web would be so ridiculous.edit. messed up the quoting a little first time round"

5/27/2011,"first of all, this is the part you failed to find:"
5/27/2011,"the only miners in this game now are macro miners anyway. so what is the point. ccp are trying to remove them from the game but it is simply impossible. by far mining is the most unpleasant money making technique in the game, and in the recent years it became economically inefficient. so following this line of thoughts, which is correct, we can conclude that the only miners are macrominers.i agree with the idea of legal macromining. i might even start using the skills i've learned 5 years ago, now they are totally useless."
5/27/2011,i support this idea as long as the presence of a macro-mining module on a ship causes concord to ignore all agression against it.
5/27/2011,"thank you trebor and seleene for the previews. seleene, i think, did a better job in disguising that not much is allowed to be reported at this time. and the discussion in this thread was helpful in raising expectations again about what's to come."
5/27/2011,last year about this time csm was able to inform players that ccp had decided to hold off on most space ship related stuff and work on incarna for the next 18 months. we saw through subsequent dev blog the extensive number of devs that left the spaceship aspect of the game for other things like dust and incarna. 18 months is going to be up in december about - six months out. any word on whether they will be able to reassign those devs to the space ship game in 6 months?
5/27/2011,just a bit more of an explanation if anyone on the csm was unaware of what happened last year:back in june 2010 ccp was very upfront with csm that many space ship related matters in eve would be on hold for 18 months due to incarna and dust. well that is going to be up in december. following those minutes in july 2010 we received this dev blog:
5/27/2011,"omg i have found some sample source code!!!#include pwnage.hint tearcollector(noob carebear, tears bucket){ tears x; // holds the carebear tears x = suicide_gank(&carebear) + bucket; // pwn the carebear hard, add tears to the bucket printf(""die noob!!!""); // says hello return x //return filled tear bucket}"
5/27/2011,"is there any reason why the source code for the client could not be made open source? at least that would mean if there were bugs, they could be found and reported quicker by the people looking through it. also i don't think having private servers is a threat to ccp, how many people would want to move to an empty server? and also, look at the power it takes to keep tranquility up anyway, the threat of a rival server is virtually nothing.plz ccp, give us code access so we can all work together for a better game :)"
5/27/2011,"""incarna cannot be compelling unless it is enforced"". the day that was said this argument was over. when it was repeated during fanfest, that really removed any potential of a wide variety of considerations (ranging from the psychological to the commercial).look on the bright side, players have already found ways to not load incarna, and ccp are at this point not forcing you to use only incarna provided ui elements. be happy. alternatively, be quiet, get a watch."
5/27/2011,i see a light at the end of the tunnel...
5/27/2011,"in eve, you should always assume this is an oncoming train."

5/28/2011,why didn't i support this before?
5/28/2011,"ccp.... you are saddening me aswell. i don't care at all about your captains quarters that will bore us for a year until then you maybe figure out ""walking in stations"" in 2012 (i can't imagine by then ccp will have more than a dozen different station layouts.)very slow progress and i thought incursion was going to finally get changes but very few insignificant impacted for the good. where are the new t3 ships? just cruisers huh? this has been a long wait aswell...does ccp think incarna is going to seriously interest new subscribers with one room to walk in? they're going to think the game developers really half assed the station part on the get-go. they probably won't care enough to wait a year for ccp to release new parts of the station. total flop idea for getting new subs in."
5/28/2011,"my love, my anger, and all of my support."
5/28/2011,"no.when ccp presented their idea for how motherships were to be turned into supercaps, the whole motherships community had a total meltdown, lashing out in furious nerdrage in several epic threadnaughts. but as always, ccp stood firm, refusing a kne-jerk reaktion to the whining and *****ing. therefore, we got a well balanced supercap line right from the start."
5/28/2011,10-Jan
5/28/2011,"boded the dumb parts. everyone was wrong, ccp, mothership pilots, and ccp again. supercarriers need to be nerfed.supercaps are not balanced. supers, are now an i win button, just like aoe doomsdays were before. 0.0 warfare has become who is able to field the most supers, and all 0.0 alliances are complaining that it is really not fun anymore. it has degenerated to the point where fleets will just disband if the other side has more supers logged on, meaning no more epic pew pew space battles. this is not to say epic battles don't occur, just everyone realizes that if one side can jump in 20 while the other can get 10, it is pretty much guaranteed that the side able to field ten supers might as well just go home even if their support fleet outnumbers the other 5:1."
5/28/2011,"what i was trying to convey here originates in my perception that ccps method to achieve game-balance through community feedback has become a very blunt instrument. they have built in an incentive to whine and moan and those you typically will here from the most are those with the least grasp on, or interest in, actual balance.(contrary to what the average caod poster will tell you, those players with the most time end effort vested into the game are not necessarily those who will give you the most unbiased view on balance issues.)i'm well aware of the current supercarrier farce and my statement ""therefore, we got a well balanced super cap line from the start"" was meant to be taken as anything but an honest assessment on current super carriers. i thought most people would get that."
5/28/2011,"i'd like it too, pos should have one difference from stations. limited space for ships and stuff. and ceo or director could assign each member some space in the pos which he could use however he wants."
5/28/2011,"bad ideai do not want to wake up one morning to find some of my corp members have back-stabbed the corp by setting up a personal pos in my system which i dont have access to, so that they can begin to force me and everyone else out.sure they can back-stab by bringing a different corp into my system so they can set a tower up, but please lets not make it easier for them."
5/28/2011,"well, if i were to go by just the first and last pages, i'd say it's pretty much a unanimous no!clearly, nobody is looking at other possibilities, or where ccp could go with this. clearly, nobody is taking into account that new players, or more recent players could get a leg up benefit from the introduction of microtransactions, or they just don't really care. personally, i think the newb's should benefit from the option to microtransaction there way ahead a bit, and it's not like old players would suffer from it given they could do the same if they really thought they needed to. yeah right.. alliances that can afford to bid 30 billion for a slot in tounament ix really need a lot of help. heck, wonder about those guys that got access to original t2 bpo's, or have researched bpo's for cap's and more to the point they can produce cheaper and faster than anyone else. no.. that's completely fair to any new player, especially those that are completely unavailable unless someone happens to decide to sell, and then the only ones that can afford it are the big alliances with all the capital.this game is already so balanced that a microtransaction for $50 to buy a titan wouldn't damage it. that's sarcasm by the way, for those arrogant enough to assume everyone else is dimwitted. trolls, i'm looking at you. mostly.just to be different, and because i don't immediately assume ccp is stupid and microtransactions are going to completely obliterate everything, i'm going to vote yes.yes!!just not cosmetic ones. that would lack integrity, as ccp has already stated that such things as character customization would always be free. the portrait and tweak part anyway. if someone wants to spend $10 on a new shirt or a pair of styling shades, then go for it.what are you afraid of?"
5/28/2011,"no.ccp must listen players sometimes. we have unbalance in ships. after they fix this i will say 'cosmetics only', but right now i want fixed game, not a glamour look or something.where is my ewfrigates?where is 4th bonus for assault frigs?where is all hybrid boats?rokh can shoot at 200km but warp range 150 make this useless. change role to rokh from supersniper to something usefull or make 250km warp range.why do we need dreadnought if we have supercaps?counter for subcap blob is bombers, counter for supercap blob is... biger supercap blob. where is rock-scissors-paper rule?where is missile-turrets models? why do you hate caldari so much?when i play eve, i want actualy fly on my ships, not paint and look at it. it's a bad joke, from ccp, and i read this like ""you can't fly, but u can make them look better""."

5/28/2011,"supported, i want to be able to dock, grab some ammo/whatever and get back into space, not have to wait for the cq to load, then do what i wanted. i want the ability to opt out of incarna bloat and lag and if i could mine ice in a wh i wouldn't even need to dock at a station.space barbies/eve fortress 2 =/=internet spaceships"
5/28/2011,"those who support please don't forget to check the little ""support this topic"" box when you post."
5/28/2011,you're ******ed you know how hard it's going to be to load the station compared to pre-cq?not that it matters to me lol
5/28/2011,"i admit my cpu is a cruddy pos, but it runs eve and that is ok. i recently tried the cq on duality, and my cpu said, ""screw you!"". i don't (want to/can't) play space barbie dress-up, i want to play eve.edit: forgot to support."

5/28/2011,signed.
5/28/2011,"in the wake of ""realistic"" rat ecms..."
5/28/2011,"as the topic name says. please csm, pass it to ccp.if they implement vanity items avaible for plex convertible currency, it will (no metter what they say about that) drastically increase plex prices.just look at today plex price and 100m rise jita plex cost just few hours after blog disclosing new currency. it will go much farther.please, allow players to buy aur for money and trade them like plexes for isk, but dont allow plex<->aur conversion(it will still be possible via plex<->isk trade<->aur, but will not remove plex from game like plex<->aur conversion)"
5/28/2011,supporting my own idea :)
5/28/2011,1
5/28/2011,"conditionally supported.i have faith that ccp will be able to monitor the plex prices, but if anything were to happen it could mess up the market. better safe than sorry."
5/28/2011,"yeah, actually think this is a bad idea too. buying the clothes/stuff on market for isk is fine, buying plex for isk is fine, buying items for aur is fine. i will point out, that the dev blog doesn't say anything about buying aur for isk though, only that you can convert a plex into aur, and they'll be monitoring plex prices to balance the plex to aur conversion. without that conversion, aur will be unobtanium."
5/28/2011,"once everyone has dressed up their space barbies, plex will experience the typical post patch crash again. this is just typical pre-patch speculation, driven higher with speculation on space barbie accessories being hot ticket items. everybody is forgetting that there will be a secondary market later on, when everyone has purchased their space barbie accessories, there will be aur left over which will get sold for isk.plex>aur>isk>plexlooks like a new isk sink to me. not supported."
5/28/2011,"not supported either. the market will stabilize because it must. ccp will not allow the plex cost to rise too much as they have an investment far greater than any player in this thread or elsewhere to keep people using it.there has been too much fear mongering thus far on something that hasn't even happened and may not happen at all.and i pay for both my subs with plex so i'm not immune to plex costs rising whatsoever. i just choose not to take an alarmist position before the damned patch is eve released. just wait till the patch and see what happens, you may end up feeling dumb for losing your mind over nothing.however, you can't separate the damned aur from the plex or it negates the whole purpose of the system which is to make money. if plex is not consumed for this process, then no money is made for ccp."
5/28/2011,"where do you see sink in here? nowhere in this process isk leaves game, only changes hands. it is plex that leaves game, rising plex price.yes there is, if aur is made using rl money, just like plex is."
5/28/2011,this makes no sense in a game where intel is so important.
5/28/2011,"wtf are you smoking?! you're either brand spanking new to eve and don't understand mechanics or you're an idiot... scratch that we already know you're an idiot. sounds to me like your can baiting outside a station and your ****ed off cause ppl take ur obvious bait and dock right after they loot it. then they wait out the 15 mins and u'r sol. awe, poor baby. if you're talking about looting missions, last i saw, there's no station in missions so wtf r u talking about? if u'r that peeved about it, pvp fit ur mission ship and blast him."
5/28/2011,"ninja looting is a profession, just like scamming, just like shipping drugs, just like suicide ganking. i don't do any of these because i find missions more profitable and fun with my buddies then waiting for an expensive target to roll around. (we all lack patience, don't ask how we ended up on eve.)short of it is this: with the new agent changes, ninja looters have their work cut out for them because mission hubs will for now on exist only because 'that's where everyone used to go'. over time this will break down and ninjas will simply hang out around constellations with multiple lvl 4 agents.solution to ninjas (salvage or loot)-fly with a buddy...or six. trust me, that one ninja will try to loot just to see if you can kill him. don't screw it up, keep an inty handy! seriously though, bring a buddy to help salvage the room as you're in it, or fly in right after for those fleet-touchy missions. flying solo always? you're missing out on eve and the point of an mmo, so you're beyond help really.-relocate to a different agent: you only have to move two ships, your mission boat and your salvage boat if you have one. moving gear shouldn't be an issue since the second boat usually has a sizable hold. if you don't have the second boat and fly a marauder, stop failing at salvaging your own missions while there. if you don't have any salvaging boat...why the hell are you complaining?-for the wealthy, get a few shuttles and a few mission ships dispersed around various agents and systems. got a pesky ninja? leave him for one of your other agents. they're all q20 now, so just travel time at this point. it's hard to be a ninja when there's nothing to, you know, ninja.-my favorite: gank 'em. most ninjas fly dirt cheap ships since they might get ganked or killed if they loot. most fly fast ships to actually accomplish the task of ninja salvaging. if your a mission tycoon, a lost destroyer or two isn't going to keep ammo out of your battleship. go for maximum gank and keep ten or twenty of them handy. why? so when he comes back, you can get him again. a ninja will move on if he knows you're going to make it more trouble than the salvage is worth.tl;dr suck it up, there are ways to deal with ninjas. they are but one challenge the game can offer. for crying out loud it's an mmo, and eve for that matter. you'll only dumb the game down further by removing the criminal element of the game. eve is a lawless universe, hisec and lowsec. it's not perfect-sec."
5/28/2011,what?
5/28/2011,buy a marauder and shut the **** up.
5/28/2011,yet another trolling idiot - yeah taht helps when they fecking insta dock!!! stupid idiottrolls are trolls boring...simple fact they need docking timer - anyone says otherwise give me a god damn reason...
5/28/2011,"the reason is that you are making no sense, and have shouted ""why can they insta dock"" so many times that people are ignoring you.reasons have already been given. thieves can insta dock. people who shoot first can't. end of story.if you don't like it, stop shooting people around the station. if you are one of those irritating station baiters, then you will find no sympathy."
5/28/2011,how about no
5/28/2011,"^this. stop playing station games, and your troubles will go away."
5/28/2011,"seeing your both dumb - prob reason why your get reset - the simple fact is everyone who gets agression they cant dock - why should this be different..also whats the point of having aggression if they can instantly dock and wait it out - it doesnt make senseand not one person has given a reasonable argument against this, and why they should be able to dock - not one - just more ninja looter trolls crying cos they might haev to work for onceand kill keep shouting they should be able to dock - because quite simply they shouldnt...sorry i aint backing down no maytter how many trolls there are..."
5/28/2011,"this is eve,,,but fair is fair, we should and everyone in your pc corp should be able to shoot them, not pod just a nice pop. i know ninja are part of eve like pirates are, but the concord should know that they have stolen.still like to hear others players thoughts..."
5/28/2011,"reset?also, stealing **** is not the same as shooting someone. why should station owners care who steals something? why do bait can gatecamps need a boost? fyi i'm not a 'just more ninja looter trolls crying cos (i) might haev to work for once', i just happen to think you lick windows in your spare time."
5/28/2011,yup.
5/28/2011,yes i give my support
5/28/2011,i just boldet and underlined to some of you who cant or probably simply dont want to read whole idea from begin to the end.
5/28/2011,"it's not fair? you gonna throw a tantrum now? seriously, all you whiners about neutral rr, just ***** because your to damn lazy to think tactics. all you want to have to do is bring gank dps. let's imagine for a moment, there's a game called ""rock, paper, siccors (roshambo or whatever). rock beats siccors, paper beats rock, siccors beats paper. the idea is, u and ur opponent shake ur fists 3 times in unison. on the third shake u hand gesture ur attack... but here's the catch, you don't know what he's gonna do! so you study ur opponent... get all mental and jedi like to out witt your opponent! if you keep bringing the rock, don't ***** cause he keeps bringing the paper! helps your odds of winning if you throw in a siccor or two.if by now you're still wondering what the siccors are in relation to eve, well, you just flat suck and need to learn to eve.btw, just so you all know rr ships are available on the market to everyone!grow a brain, get a clue, stop whining, and learn to eve.this thread, definitely not supported!"
5/28/2011,sorry you don't have any friends
5/28/2011,"oh stop crying - please dont take away my alt repper, cos im so lame at pvp i cant fight properly - bhwaaaa"
5/28/2011,"seems to me that you aren't mad about nuet rrs as much as other people having them when you don't.it is completely fair in the aspect of a 10 man corp decs a 10 man corp. well you should consider that fact that your opponent may have that before wardeccing someone. aswell as you can utilize nuet rr yourself.as far as your gcc comment they already are red to you as soon as they rep your target and are targets free for you too shoot. although i would like to see an aggression timer where you cant dock or jump for a minute be implemented, just as if they were shooting you since they are contributing to the battle just as much as anyone."
5/28/2011,"except they don't, because it all happens in peoples heads. hence why it's called psychological warfare. for it to work, someone has to start being emotional."
5/28/2011,"so when a miner or ratter gets killed by a cloaker that had been afk for days it didn't really happen... it's all in his head .edit: and i'm feeling so generous that i'll even anticipate and post your response:""then he's not afk"".and again, i'll respond that a teaspoon does not stop being a teaspoon because you fill it with cough syrup. and i'll ask you to stop playing on the literal definition of the words ""afk cloaker"", and again we'll start another circular reasoning discussion :p.by the way, notice how your defense position will switch from ""it's all psychological and in the ratter's mind"" to ""well, ok, afk cloaking can net you kills, but it's necessary to counter local"" or ""it's for a good cause... it helps against botting"".your arguments are pretty much bait-and-switch and lead to circular reasoning and we'll just spend days going round and round."
5/28/2011,"botters should never be a defence for keeping afk cloaking. i look at that as more of a bonus, rather than a basis for keeping it. do you not consider it to be psychological warfare, when they are afk?as far as the ratter is concerned, there are many that continue to rat with an enemy in local. i've done it myself in the past. sure you could lose a ship, but we all had systems in place and took certain steps. it never bothered us and in fact made things a lot more enjoyable, especially when they lost. what you and others are asking for isn't balance. balance would be an approach that linked local and cloaking in a change. i'm all for that."
5/28/2011,"again, you are arguing semantics. but yes, afk cloaking (as in the technique, not the literal definition) is, among other things, psychological. it's psychological because the ratter/miner does not know when the afk cloaker is at the keyboard or afk. but to claim it is only psychological is deceptive and dishonest. afk cloaking (as in the profession, not the literal definition) projects a real threat, and a miner or ratter that stops viewing it as such will eventually end up losing his ship. do you see why afk cloaking is a real threat, and not just psychological as you imply?now, i'll just emphasize that i don't have a problem with a miner/ratter losing his ship in 0.0 for getting careless. it's part of the job. what i have a problem with is that an afk cloaker (as in the profession, not the literal definition) is able to be careless and not suffer the consequences in situation where he should. <== this is what i'd like to see changed. in other words, add risk to afk cloaking (the profession, not the literal definition). and i'm not asking for ccp to take away the risk that cloakers (and even afk cloakers) bring. i'm asking ccp to add risk to them as well. this is not an unreasonable request. what i find unreasonable is that people want to keep afk cloaking (again, the profession) risk-free, with no one having the ability to bring unconsensual pvp to them, the same way they are able to bring unconsensual pvp to others. this, by all means, is unfair and not balanced.this simply isn't true. for a very long time i've openly stated i would welcome the removal of local as long as it is a fair and balanced change. i, however, do not welcome the removal of local without a suitable replacement that is fair to all parties (except botters, of course).i don't mind cloakers cloaking in a system and terrorizing local. i don't mind cloakers subverting local. i don't mind cloakers doing exactly what they do now except that they are able to do it while they sleep or are at school. and that is the only thing i'd like to see changed.so i will ask you again (since you haven't answered the question yet), why are you against afk cloakers being exposed to a little risk?"
5/28/2011,"solution to afk cloaking is easy, make a cloaking device use cap at a rate that increaces cap use over time eventually the coaking device will use cap faster than it recharges, cap dies then cloaking device fails"
5/28/2011,"then the cloaker cant recloak due to no cap and dies due to having very weak tanks, regardless of whether the cloaker was afk or not to begin with."
5/28/2011,"currently all fights in null sec are decided by dropping super capitals on the field to win a fight they should otherwise be losing. everyone can see this from the invasion in the north. invaders start losing a fight, they drop superstitious on the field for the ""i win!"" button. this is also happening in low sec as well.there have been other ideas out on how to nerf them but they are all pretty much inspiring. that is until now.what i propose is that in addition to isotopes for super caps to jump, they should also have a daily maintenance fee. in the recent dev blog there will be a new currency called aurum. in order to be able to do anything with the super capital like jump, deploy fighter bombers, use the doomsday or even warp. one would need to pay the aurum maintenance after logging in. this amount should have some meaningful amount like 500-1000 aurum.this would also encourage super capital pilots to keep them logged in if they plan on using them. no more of this, log in, hot drop, get safe, log out to hide number and rinse and repeated garbage. obviously you can log in and cloak, but if you want to use the super, you need to pay for the maintenance first."
5/28/2011,not even amusing.1/10
5/28/2011,i missed you cromo.
5/28/2011,"oh op, you're such a maroon."
5/28/2011,moron you mean?
5/28/2011,"i see that went ten feet over your head.as to the op, get out."
5/28/2011,try reading.... before you end up 6 feet under... really helps.ps: and yes i got the joke...i'm only stating the obvious...but it seems that was a little over your head.
5/28/2011,"seeing how the maller will soon be redesigned, i'm sure many of the less than pleasant looking ships will follow, and i'm sure the moa will be one of them. seeing pretty new ships would be great and all, because some of this ships in the game are hideous (blackbird and imicus come to mind), but that's not really what they have going for them. part of why the moa comes up in discussion is that fact that it is as ugly as it is. what would happen if our popular resident ugly duckling became a supermodel like everyone else? sure, they all will look pretty, but the reputation the moa will receive as one of the ugliest ships in eve will be dashed away in a polished, symmetrical haze.tl;dr: updating the textures on the moa is fine, but please, leave the model the way it is when it comes time for it to be looked at by ccp's art team. i love my ugly duckling and i'd hate to have to say goodbye to it."
5/28/2011,"considering the way the scorpion hull was redesigned, i imagine all ships will be getting a sleep figure...but one that maintains hallmark looks. you can bet the moa will still have a big box on its side for no reason and a crane neck...equally for no reason. the blackbird will likely continue to be the happy meal box of doom."
5/28/2011,"the moa is hideous, and the quicker someone dumps that model in a ditch somewhere, the better.i'd like an onyx that i can look at please."
5/28/2011,"on a scale of 1-10 how mad are you?changes made to eve won't affect me, as i said i can fly any race. just don't think it's necessary."
5/28/2011,"ah, both then, k."
5/28/2011,"1, and that's only for the stupidity inherent in your terrible posting."
5/28/2011,"free education on why hybrids are not very useable:optimal range is poor,falloff range is poor,alpha is poor,damage output is poor*,tracking should be better,cap use needs to be lowered,fittings need to be looked at,useless in fleetlag.*doing therm/kin your actually doing less damage than a weapon that can do em/exp.thing is hybrids are not very useful in most situations and it would be a boost too two races which are in dire need of it.just because you dont seem to understand this even with your amazing skillpoints and eft skills."
5/28/2011,"wow it's a good thing you said that because ccp was going to quit space sims and start buffing gallente.gallente obviously does not need a boost, just look at all those gallente ships flying around"
5/28/2011,"quite simply they want you to actually have to keep track of you training somewhat and login once in a while as opposed to afk-subscription training accounts mindlessly, because activity is good for the game and training for 6 months without even playing the game once is not."
5/28/2011,why on earth would ccp give a **** about people who are paying... but aren't actually logging in? it's free money.
5/28/2011,"because they want them to keep paying, forever, and people don't pay for a dead game where people hardly login because they don't feel like they have to.most mmos have some sort of mechanic to encourage players to remain active, eve's 24 hour limited training queue is one of the most mild methods. the-game-to-not-be-named has 'dailies', honor point limits, instance timers, and literally endless gear grinding all designed in a manner to encourage players to remain consistently active over extended periods of time, in comparison eve's method of encouraging activity is downright flexible and user friendly. most folks simply don't realize the sutble intentions behind alot of these game mechanics."
5/28/2011,that logic path doesn't apply for eve. a lot of people are still paying that wouldn't be in another 'play-to-level' mmorpg.
5/28/2011,"sniped me before i edited, meh. it is what these sorts of keep-active kind of mechanics are put in place for, whether you think they're effective or not it's the reason they were put into place."
5/28/2011,they aren't effective. so they are fail mechanics.
5/28/2011,"i don't see how logging for 2-5 minutes is seen as a necessary need for ccp. mindless, what are you talking about ? the solution i'm proposing will ensure that you're training something, doesn't mean you'll get the optimum route to access the best stuff. it's a solution for the unfortunate, the busy and active people of this game. training time is why we pay, or i'd just take a break and cancel the subscription for 2-3 months."
5/28/2011,doesn't mean it can't be changed. what if i spent all week in front of a computer at work and i don't even want to sit in front of it the weekend 'cause i have stuff to do and it's sunny outside... why should i be penalized for that ? i want some liberty damn it.
5/28/2011,"then drop a level 5 into training.the multibillion dollar mmo gaming industry disagrees. to be perfectly honest it probally wouldn't take me long to quit eve if i wasn't in the habit of logging on at least a little bit each day to check/adjust/maintain my skill training and end up doing something else too, i just wouldn't bother with keeping my subscription up when i didn't even have to log on... kinda a vicious cycle of laziness, and i'm sure there's plenty enough folks as lazy as me(tens of thousands tbh).people who feel no need to log on, tend to play infrequently, and people who play infrequently, tend to stop playing. this is the entire idea behind games attempting to have meaningful longterm progressions(grinding for gear... training skills...) that keep you playing regularly, because people playing regularly don't quit very much.be it level progression, buying that new ship, skill training, 'raids', periodic content updates, havesting your crops on farmville, or genuinely just for fun... anything that keeps you regularly logging on an mmo is a good thing from a business perspective.habit at doing these things is almost the only reason i bother to play games after i've figured most everything out, and i'm content with that."
5/28/2011,"your mistake is confusing the skill change process with the methods of keeping 'endgame' players busy.first of all, the skill changes rarely happen at convenient times or even days. the queue is helpful, but does not actually dump the problem.i appreciate the queue, because i often can't be online when a skill finishes. but i still have to pay a disproportionate amount of time to maintain my awareness of the skill cycling (which rarely happens when i actually do login to play).logging in just to change the skills or add to the queue is a con, not a pro. it always has been."
5/28/2011,"i actually quit playing farmville because of that mechanic, (along with every othe facebook game), and the only reason i ever played was to be sociable. people send invite; play to make them happy; game turns out to bea high maintenance, endless grind, so you decide it's not really worth it.grind's really bite to be honest, and they don't even remotely hold my interest in a game. the more grind; the more gone."
5/28/2011,"and how do people who only log onto the game for 5 minutes to update a skill add to the gaming experience for everyone else? your logic and ccp's logic here fail. the only thing it may do is help ccp inflate their daily log on numbers by making it look like the game is more active than it is.point is, you pay for it, you should be able to set your skills up as far in advance as your sub is paid for. if you buy 48 plex and turn them into game time, you should be able to set you que up for the next 4 years. the loss of those who would log in only to update a que is no loss at all."
5/28/2011,"hey thanks, even a better idea here..."
5/28/2011,"this has been an integral part of the game since its creation.if you have a problem with it, the door is on the left and don't let it hit you on the way out."
5/28/2011,it was already changed once... just saying.
5/28/2011,"if it was changed once it can be changed again. as it exists now, it serves no purpose other than to make you have to log on to keep updating skills and the only reason they would want someone to do that would be to inflate log on numbers.does anyone have another explanation?"
5/28/2011,"if it got you to log on, it was a win for business. simple as that.this has less impact for older players who have long training times and are typically more entangled in the game in other ways, but... consider the new player-with limited training queue:-day 1-*logs on for the first time**sorta figures some things out**sets skills to train*'i'd better log on tomorrow to set new skills!'*does random stuff**logs off*-day 2-*logs on**sets skills to train*'i'd better log on again tomorrow to set more!'*does random stuff**logs off*-day 3-*same as the previous day... repeated for a long time*without limited training queue:-day 1-*logs on for the first time**sorta figures some things out*'oh, i can queue up skills forever! i'll wait until im skilled in battleships, cuz bigger is better obviously.'*sets skills to train to the end of time*'i'd better wait a few months until i'm trained!'*does random stuff**logs off*-day 2-*nothing*-day 3-*same as the previous day... repeated for a long time*-give or take a few months later-'well i don't really play that game anyways'*unsubscribes*if you can't see the basic business sense of getting people to regularly log on to your game, i really don't know how to explain it to you."
5/28/2011,"you pay to train, that's the basic of it. after reading most of your comments it's as if you're implying to-work at cpp and have been part of the development process-have conducted or read extensive research on gamers consuming profile-have read or conducted surveys on eve players and know what they think.the change wouldn't impact you obviously, but to enlighten your mind, just ask a non-gamer, your parents, or uncle or any other friends who don't play games, and explain to them the training process that requires you to log every now and then so that you don't lose any benefit from the game you pay for. their reaction will be closer to the truth than you'll ever be.edit: also with your stupid example, you're implying that the training process hooks people on the game. meaning that if i was mentally unbalanced i could play 48 hours in a row, forget the baby, baby dies, go on trial and justify that the system of the game caused this because it works like her0in, and win my case ! (can't believe the name of this drug is censored)people won't stop playing, they will just have one less burden on their mind, and one less chore to fill before going to bed."
5/28/2011,"well, that was a wildly inappropriate comment seriously, without change, progress is not possible. quit the ultra-conservative mentality before it ruins you"
5/28/2011,"so, this comes in, and i assume you're removing attributes too?i'm specced per/int, can i use my continuous skill training to skill up a pile of social skills easily? i wouldn't be logging in, and you are trying to remove all of the disadvantages of not logging in, right?"
5/28/2011,"you seem under the illusion that what players want and what is best for a game are the same.regardless, if you can't plan ahead far enough to drop a long skill in training when you can't bother to log on for 30 seconds to update your skill queue the next day, spreadsheets online probally isn't for you."
5/28/2011,"siriusly guys how dumb is that?i can set up buy contract for lets say not existend in game bpo for daredevil , but has no way to set up buy contract for existend bpc of same ship?tumb up if you are agree with, that this must be fixed."
5/28/2011,"it's not getting scammed or even knowing how to read; it's the frakin' hosers spamming up local that ****es people off. all that you see in jita is an occaisional, (1 in 500), legit statement/comment/snippet of conversation, a bunch of people warning about scams, and 98% of the rest is scams. and it roll's by at one message every 0.2 seconds. it is the most annoying, aggravating reason not to play eve i've ever seen. ..and then you leave jita or change to some other channel, and heave a sigh of relief.of course, you might want to take into account, that my main is in jita, and i've not logged in for more than 2 minutes in the last 4 weeks. ..and that, about twice."
5/28/2011,"which is why there is help chat. or recruitment. or your own private channel. or best: minimize chat. seriously, if this is your only legitimate reason for being angry about scams, how on earth do you handle spammers in other channels? oh wait...block...hmm, ever thought about using that on these guys? believe it or not, scammers don't replace their characters like rmt does, or not at the same rate anyhow. you obviously dislike them and thus will never talk to them, just block them and presto you have a clean local."
5/28/2011,"logging into jita and seeing local, causing me to lose all interest in playing eve for the day is reason enough. obviously, you haven't spent much time in local in jita. the messages role by so fast you have to scroll up to block them, and they just keep bumping, and you can't block anyhow. that, and there are so many scammers, you'd fill your block list in an hour or two at least, probably 20 minutes or less in reality.local is auto on log in btw. help chat? what for? ..so i can get unrealistic or biased advice? kind of like what i find here actually; which is why i keep telling you all to **** off.dislike them? hardly, i could care less and have no idea who they are. thought has occured to me that scamming is a perfect way of laundering rmt isk though, or better yet, delivering it. so yeah, some of them could be rmt's, a lot of them are just inconsiderate jerks who have attained unprecedented levels of nerdom. some are obviously on drugs or alcohol, or both, while others claim to be and aren't. most are relatively intelligent, while lacking any sense or decency, (like most other players in eve), while some are obviously lacking in real intelligence, and others are too smart for their own good. most, think they're smarter than everyone else, while actually being of considerably average intelligence.i talk at them sometimes, and sometimes they actually respond, but usually i consider this a bad ssign, as i'm probably being blocked by everybody in jita local for talking at/to them in the first place. it becomes talking to when they respond you know, following which any response on your part makes you onbe of them in everybody elses eyes. did i mention people are stupid. it shows when they jump to conclusions or assume you are doing/thinking something they somehow stereotype to you in a single two sentence conversation.i might not stick around much anyhow, being as eve has become something it wasn't when i started playing. nothing to do with the dev's; it's actually strictly a playerbase issue. see, the thing of it is, most of you are *******s, and i don't like you much. not everybody, but the ones that aren't are too few, and dropping like flies everyday. they don't want to play this game with you, any more than i do. go figure."

5/28/2011,"i think its is fair to say that just for continuities sake, that covert reconfig t3's should be able to use the covert cyno just due to the fact that all other cov ops boats can. so why not make it fair and to what the description originally said about the subsystem. although i can also understand that having the interdiction nullifier on it can be considered a little unfair because how much easier it would be to light the cov ops cyno where ever you wanted. a fair compromise tho i believe if ccp doesn't want to add it for what ever reason it maybe would be to extend the range of the portal slightly farther than it is now. 2 extra lyrs would be phenomenal when it comes to moving around for those who live in low sec to move into the 0.0 regions. your cyno boats still have to take a risk getting to where they need to go but leaves new opportunities to those of us that don't live or want to live in 0.0 to access the different types of pvp that are available in the game."

5/28/2011,"with the new adition of player retribution for the smuggling mechanic planned for the near future, i have been wondering how this addition could be expanded upon. it comes in two parts, as one will supliment the other. so here goesmy first line of though ran as follows. with the bounty mechanic so badly broken, i have thought of a way we can revamp it. there are two main ways to revamp it that i have come up with. now, bounties are mostly levied on pirates. i suggest that bounties start mounting automatically on a percentage of the isk they detroy/loot. make it a small percentage like 1 or 2 or 3 percent. you can even make the percentage higher for the security level drop...the lower security the higher percentage and that the bounty is collectable on destruction of the pirate's ship, not his pod. this will add two things to the game. the profession bounty hunters will become a real profession with people able to actually collect bounties to make it a sustainable profession. you could even add a sec status increase like npc pirates. the second thing this will add will be a new minigame for pirates, who can get the biggest bounty on them before losing it to someone. furthermore, player added bounties can still be added and can be collected upon destruction of said pirate's ship, and here comes the new twist, the player who issued the bounty will have say if it pays out. in other words, if the pirate creates an alt and blows up a newbship with the alt, then the player can say no to the payout, and keep the bounty still on the pirate. also, another mechanic i would introduce is the standings being tracked by the game to ensure one blue/corpmate cant shoot a pirate that is friendly to him and collect the bounty and share it with the pirate. also, a tracking of acounts will be a good idea, so that no pirate can use his spy alt or other such thing to collect bounties on their heads. eg. ip logging, credit card logging, fleet history logging etc. the other way to change bounties is not on total isk destroyed, but lets say 10% of the value of the ship that the pirate is flying. make it low enough that there will be no profit for the pirate to blow up his own ship even if it is insured.the next part, where player retribution is concerned is this, allow pirates into highsec. upon entering highsec, faction police place a ""tag"" onto the pirate which then apears in everyone's overview as a warpable object. now, if a pirate enters lowsec, he will still suffer from the finger of doom by concord if he does engage a player that doesnt engage him first. this way, we have a pirate in highsec, who has a bounty on him and is a warpable object, which will mean players can exact retribution from him and make a few isk. i am sure ccp will be a lot better than myself at changing the mechanics to make it more balanced, but this is the broad outline of my idea. please note, that pirates will still be killable by anyone in highsec."
5/29/2011,making cq optional upon docking (and generally not immersion breaking as its a feature supposed to be about making the game more immersive) seems to be a pretty hot topic atm. and its proliferating threads like mad. might want to add this thread to your list.i also would have thought that the issue of now only having 50 fittings for the fitting tool would have been a worthy issue.

5/29/2011,"i've seen a lot of this kind of posting in a view games. they all have some things in common:nothing happens after, if something happens it is taking too long and is not what the community want. and the most disturbing thing is that i still believe one day the developer will listen to what we say. so after finishing the whine let's try to do something productive. i'm a gallente pilot whit passion, and this means i love and hate them in a balance auf 50/50.ships i like and i think they work very well. dominix, ishtar, nemesis, ishkur ... well that's it. this ships all have one thing in common, they don't use gunnery. ships from the gallente which i don't like are the remaining. why is that so? well i thing the gunnery isn't effective at all. i don't want to repeat all the stuff other already have posted in this forum. the second thing is the huge mass, the most ships ""work"" to inertial. third is the % to armor repair amount. i really don't fly the ships with this bonus, and if would fly them (for example in pvp), i won't use this bonus so for me this bonus is useless and waste. i don't have a solution for the gunnery, but a suggestion for the armor repair bonus. just remove it, and put something else in. don't really know what, maybe rework the whole gallente race to a hulltank, but don't forget to find a solution for the logistic in the pvp. logistic and pvp is exact the next point i like to talk about. the ""new"" and most common ""alpha-strike-fleets"" are a pain in the ass. it is boring like hell, the lag decide who wins and who loose. you can't repair any longer, every time a ship is being attacked, it blows up in a few seconds. the most logistic pilots are frustrated (me as well) of the inaction. even if you can't chance this, you have to do something about the abaddon. i'm not saying you have to nerf it in to shrimps but try to lift up the other bss to more effectively of a abaddon. the most, and very important thing is: do something about 23h cloaking in a system!well that all for now, again wasted time of wring for nothing. meri"

5/29/2011,no
5/29/2011,"i vote cosmeticthere is no harm in cosmetic microtransactions. furthermore, when one considers that the current proposed microtransaction available items can all be bought with isk, assuming players sell them, it again proposes no harm. we can all make isk. while concern about microtransactions having the effect of people with disposable income dumping lots of money over to ccp for almost meaningless items, or for items that will be resold for isk, this may, and most likely will, benefit both sides. it gives ccp money for a small amount of effort, i guess, may draw new subscribers, and gives us some new scenery, which may be more needed then you think. also, money going to ccp is never a bad thing, well almost never, and may provide them with what they need to make the game better."

5/29/2011,"reduce market price entry errors by#1 make price entry text much bigger. text size reduces with higher resolutions to where decimals and numbers are not clearly distinguished especially for older folk. when you are reading most other commentary you can infer or deduce the correct or missing letters from context - but deducing prices misses data entry errors.#2 for confirmation show entered price in new proposed position in orders list among its nearest neighbors. the truth is that the ui software can radically change your intended price. if you somehow misformat the data the ui will change it to something valid but sometimes 10 or 100 times higher in value than you want. and you pay tax & fees on that order regardless of sale.remove current market average and its price warnings. suggest more user selectable options for price warnings: like sell order average, lowest sell in region, time averaged weekly minimum sell price, or buy order average then user selected percentage deviations from those. default sell order to completed sell order average and buy orders to completed buy order average.#1 if you are in trade the current warnings are useless for data entry errorsbecause you are trying to make a profit worth your time -- so of course sell price is much greater than your buy price. constant false warnings.#2 averaging price of filled orders results in a confused result. 2a) sell orders represent available items. buy orders are generally for future items not yet available.2b) buy orders filled represent price for quick liquidation sales -- the minimum the most agreeable sellers are will to accept. buy orders filled usually represent wholesale prices for marketeers intending to resell and not necessarily in this region. buy order do not represent the prices most retail (going to install it now) buyers are willing to pay.2c) sell orders filled usually represent end user (retail) sales and what they are willing to pay2d) averaging buy and sell orders (along with eve only lowest offer sells rule) guarantee prices will fall regardless of scarcity or demand. it is almost in impossible for the current market average to rise - except when sales eat deeply into a backlog of old sell orders. in best normal circumstances, prices may momentarily stabilize when low sell prices meet high buy prices...but only until either sell or buy orders are exhausted & the fall under pressure of market average suggested sale price continues market average and the multitude that rely on selling at that price - can only rise naturally if someone buys out market and resets price with new sole available sell order.current market average is subject to exploitation. if you find a planet out of range of other offers, you can buy from yourself at outrageous prices thus changing regional average. some people are doing this when market crashes due to current average warning and market terrorist lower prices to less than 10% within a week. no ccp, the market did not recover on its own -- someone manipulated it.suggestion: each item sold retains its price until installed & only then does it get included in market average. manipulation would at least get very painful and time consuming."

5/29/2011,"you can eliminate the tier system but what is it going to do? if you stream line the costs and make them all equal there will be no variation.do we really need to make this game so bland like the character creator? hey remember when bloodlines meaned something? now every character starts out practically the same with no advantage over another in areas, no weaknesses in areas, just a cookie cutter.removing the tier system would do that just to ships, they would be bland boring and there would be no advantage to flying one ship over another.now lets break down the 1-6 on the list.1. this is to prevent those little kids who buy buy plex from buying lots of big ships before they are really able to fly them. seriously do you want someone in a sniper abbadon with only amarr bs 1 on your fleet op? - no. this is there to ensure people are ready to fly the ship properly.2. so what change nothing? the heavier ships already weigh more. also dont fix what isnt broken with material costs.3. no, we dont need cookie cutter ships, we already have cookie cutter characters we dont need them in ships. there is no reason the dominix should have the same cap as a thron or a hyperion.4. they are already like that.5. elaborate - tweaks should be done on some ships.6. no, tech 1 is exactly that. tech 1. they are not supposed to have super powers like their tech 2 variants. if you start giving tech 1 ships those special role powers like the tech 2 variants then you are going to erase the line that defines the need to shoot for tech 2 ships.eve is already getting too easy as it is, not make it any easier and bland."

5/29/2011,"well, i thought bout this because a lot of people were saying that solo combat is dead in eve and its nearly impossible to attack anyone without someone warping to zero on you and helping. what i suggest is a module that allows you engage ships without anyone being able to help either you or the target. have a module that once activated more or less enforces honor 1 vs 1 combat and has the following properties. 1. prevents ""warp to"" on you and your target. one target maximum. one module per ship maximum.2. prevents target locking on both you and your target. and neither you or your target can lock anyone else except the other.3. prevents drones being assigned to you or target.4. this module would have a maximum range of 40km, which would be the maximum range of most overheated warp disruptors, and at which point, target can warp away anyway. module in itself denies warping only on you. not the target. target can warp if not scrammed. in other words, you need to scram him but he doesn't have to scram you. puts taget at slight advantage.5. your target cannot have any other ships or objects within 10km of it when initially ""challenged"" to 1v1. but you can pick off stragglers.6. another side effect of this module is that once activated on your target, you cannot warp away until you deactivate it or he dies. warp denial would be 10 seconds if the module is shut off willingly. zero warp denial if either party dies. 7. module cycle time would be 15 seconds and would use 3 liquid ozone per cycle.8. once activated on a target, if the target is ratting, rats lose target lock and will not be able to reacquire until the module is deactivated. its not honorable to kill someone while they fight someone else. they still maintain damage and all module status as it was.9. rig fitting.10. market sales price about 20-25 million.11. concord lp store spawn12. losing target lock does not negate the modules effects for another 30 seconds. in other words, ecm drones will not be used so you can get a warp in window. warp to denial on the target and you for another 30 seconds, unless the target lock was broken through the death of one of the parties.13. if one of the parties dies, the ""lock denial"" is valid for another 20 seconds. this will prevent the winner from being immediately ganked by whoever is watching the fight, if anyone is there. so you have a limited amount of time to loot and get out.well there could be more polishing but basically that's the gist of it."

5/29/2011,"i have to disagree. mission fits have a repper anyway, even a drone ship you are aren't going to speed anything up much because if you carried them (and i wouldn't in my mission domi) you are giving up either a set of bonused heavies or a set sentries......not a good trade off when you can slot in a large repper.it would definitely make buffer armor not just a pvp fit, which is good to me. opposed to shield buffers that can just station up for full shield you beat up the plates on a triple plated bs your are talking a few million to fix your tank every time you undock without a logi. even with a pvp myrm you usually carry a set of ec-600s, a flight or warrior iis and either a heavy/med/light flight or a second light and medium fight.so you either loose your anti-interceptor drones, your gtfo ecm drones or using the mix-flight with heavies is out ....and that is most of your dps. its certainly no free lunch."

5/29/2011,"awful idea that does nothing.it is true that supercapitals are scaling too well at the moment but there are mechanic fixes that could resolve this, like reexamining their complete immunity to ewar, nerfing supercarrier rep bonuses, implementing time dilation, or tweaking the doomsday cooldown.edit:right now the supercapital types are just too capable. dreads ought be the ""gun"" capitals and regular carriers the ""logistic"" capitals. ironically titans today aren't that bad (yes, doomsdays scale incredibly well in high lag situations but if you pay that much for a ship you expect to make something die every time you get to shoot) but the supercarriers need to give something up; the rrsc blob is just too powerful. if they keep the rr abilities then they need to give up ewar immunity and if they keep ewar immunity then they need to give up spidertanking."

5/29/2011,"it seems to be that there is a lacking of ships that use lasers, amarr, caldari, minmitar can use missiles, gallente, caldari use hybrid turrets, but only amarr ships use lasers and not all of the amarr ships use lasers, some use missiles, ie heretic, sacrilege, etc, and to be honest if we are going to nit pick the variety of lasers we might want to nit pick that projectile turrets are rather limited as well, but at least with them you have a choice in your tank. with lasers your just stuck with armor tank, i think it would be great if there could be some new amarr ships or revamped old ones to allow more choice of tank, and more ships that can use them, you wouldn't even have to have create new ship graphics, you could use the old ones and just give them bonuses to lasers instead of missiles, or make it so that instead of it being 5% to hybrid turrets on other factions ships, just make it 5% to all turrets, that way players could be able to better fit there ships to there liking and play styles. and another thing is that from what i have been told people say that minmitar ships use both missiles and projectile turrets because they are supposed to be put together from spare parts and such, but wouldn't it make more since that they have ships that use lasers, since they were enslaved by the amarr and therefore have a larger availability of lasers in there area, not to mention if they fought a war with the amarr they would have to have taken some amarr ships and built there own ships with amarr technology, (ie lasers)."
5/29/2011,the minmatar don't use lasers because lasers are terrible and projectiles are awesome.

5/30/2011,"i like incarna too, but i believe the slight benefit of forcing the entire playerbase to test its features is outweighed by the harm that move would do to immersion, as well as faith in ccp's willingness to listen to its customers."
5/30/2011,"to add insult to injury, the pod is now on a gantry hanging out there in the hangar where everyone can see you as you climb in and out while naked and dripping wet and overcoming your temporary blindness/disorientation. awesome stuff.we don't need an ""undock"" button in cq, there's a capsule we can click on to say ""board ship"". then we can undock once in control of the ship, looking at the world through a camera drone."
5/30/2011,"what harm would come to immersion by forcing cq? ere the opposite, i'd say.i can see it be slightly annoying, if all you want to do is get some more missiles or some such. otherwise, i don't see the harm; especially not to immersion."
5/30/2011,"scroll up. around the big red letters, i explained the harm to immersion.to reiterate:capsuleers do not get out of their pods every single time they dock. like players, they value their time and efficiency, and on top of that decanting is a very uncomfortable and embarrassing process. by portraying things as if capsuleers do get out of their pod every time they dock no matter how brief the task they docked for, and as if getting into and out of the pod is trivial, ccp is ignoring their own prime fiction and setting new roleplayers up with false perceptions.it has been pointed out that we can just pretend our character didn't decant whenever we don't believe they would have done so, especially since cq is currently single-player, but why should we have to? why should we have to when the solution is so extremely simple and harmless?"
5/30/2011,.wrong thread
5/30/2011,"agree. upon entering a station, player should be placed in old hangar menu, with an option (via button in hud) to leave the ship and enter cq. because immersion is fun and all, but i don't feel like leaving ship every time i decide to drop off some cargo. i doubt any capsuleer does (even in lore) .ideal way, in my opinion."
5/30/2011,+1having a choice is fun
5/30/2011,choice.
5/30/2011,"supported, my laptop runs eve fine on high settings but the new character creator lags horribly.i would like to use the old station interface instead of running through a potential lag storm everytime i need to do the simplest thing."
5/30/2011,experiments have shown that there is quite literally no reason not to make it optional.
5/30/2011,"to those who keep going ""just lower your settings if cq is such a resource hog"", did it ever occur to you that changing settings every single time you dock/undock is going to get old? just because cq gobbles up resources like an over-privileged teenager with his/her parents' credit card doesn't mean that the rest of eve does as well. currently, everything in space runs smooth as silk with more or less maxed-out settings on my machine on both tq and duality, station environment's even smoother than that on tq, and... well, bluntly, on duality the cq runs like **** with the same settings. sure, i could change the graphics settings every time i go to dock or undock, but if you think that's something people are going to do regularly, you are sadly mistaken.admittedly, the performance issues might not be a problem by the time the expansion is actually released, but given the complexity of the cq environment, and the fact that it'll still be a fairly new engine in the grand scheme of things, i'm not going to hold my breath on that being the case.also speaking as another member of the roleplaying community, i agree wholeheartedly with the idea that it's ridiculous for a capsuleer to decant every time they need to pick up a crate of ammo, or drop off a piece of cargo, or whatever. capsuleers have crew and hangar staff for that. in addition, while i really do love the bit with the opened-up capsule by the stairs in the hangar (seriously good catch on not rendering a second pod when your capsule is the active ship, by the way )... it doesn't make any sense for it to be out in the open like it is - even ignoring the privacy issues of having your slimy, naked body dumped unceremoniously out of a green egg-shaped contraption out in the open, what about safety issues? those who've read the burning life know that there are a lot of security measures in place to keep capsuleers nigh-invulnerable (or at least, excessively safe) from attack or assault on foot from the ""baseliners"" (to borrow the phrase from the jita 4-4 chron). they're not completely safe, but they're a damn sight safer than being decanted on the edge of a light-pit. i figure that the reason for the capsule just being there instead of in its own chamber as it was in a couple previous incarna-related videos (the teaser from 2009, and a presentation at 2008's fanfest, for example) is just that it's :effort: to make yet another room in the cq, but i really don't think most capsuleers would be comfortable decanting in an area as open as the current iteration of the cq would have us believe they do.so while i expect i'll probably get a fair bit of use out of cq and incarna once it's released, i don't like that the cq environment appears to be mandatory. it's immersion-breaking for the reasons i and others have given above, and i find that the performance hit really isn't worth it on the occasions i'm not going to be using it."
5/30/2011,"agreed, just as there is a button to exit the hangar, there should be a button that for exiting your pod. to exit your pod every time you dock is stupid."
5/30/2011,"i would like to see ccp give us the option to use wis/cq/incarna. a simple check box on the esc menu as many others have suggested would be just fine with me, having it on the neocom would be much nicer though. let us dock and if we wish to disembark/change ships dump us onto the balcony."

5/30/2011,"there have been countless threads about how railguns are utterly broken in comparison to their lasers and artillery counterparts as weapon platforms. after spending some time understanding how railguns work, i came to realize that it's not the weapons that need to be buffed/tweaked, its the ammo that needs to be completely overhauled.comparing ammo typeslet me first start by saying, my approach to wanting to fix railguns is that no 2 weapon platforms should act or perform in the same way. ammo for each weapon system dictates how the weapon performs and i wanted to point out each of the weapon systems distinct traits (excluding missiles) based on their ammo. lasers use frequency crystals and capacitor for their ammodeal em and thermic damage typesand can switch between ammo types without a reload penaltyprojectile turretshave no reliance on capacitor and only fire projectile shells at their targetshave 3 ranges (-50% , 0% , 60%) unlike the other weapon platforms' 8 ranges ( -50% , -37.5% , -25%, -12.5% , 0% , 20%, 40% , 60%) but make up for this disadvantage by being able to deal any damage typeand boast a generous unstacked tracking bonus for each range ( +0% , +20%, +5%)hybrid turretshybrids are supposed to share the characteristics of both lasers and projectile turrets. unfortunately, there aren't any real stand-out characteristics for hybrid ammo besides they fire shellsthey do thermic and kinetic damageeach ammo has various cap need bonuses that don't particularly make sense, from antimatter to iron, the 8 different capacitor needs are (0%,-5%, -8%, -40%, -50%, -24%, -27%, -30%) which really doesn't aid hybrids in having any distinct trait or advantage over the other two weapon platforms. how railguns should functionlet me start by disagreeing with how hybrid ammo is currently dictating damage and cap need for railguns. it is contradictive to how a railgun works. basically, a railgun is an electric gun with two conductive rails and a conductive shell in-between them to complete the circuit. the destructive force of a railgun doesn't come from its payload, but rather its kinetic force. the magnitude of this kinetic force is always a function of two things: the length of the physical rails and the amount of current (capacitor) delivered to the rails. knowing this, there is a problem with the current ammo we have for railguns. looking at the facts, the current description for hybrid charges states that they all have a titanium shell, which means the conductivity of each shell type (antimatter, plutonium, iridium, etc) is the same. right now, hybrids use the most cap at their closest ammo ranges and the least at the mid-long range types. so how do their ranges and cap needs make any sense together? it's like the attributes used in hybrid charges are just there because ccp is following the same convention that frequency crystals preceded with. for a railgun on earth, less energy means less velocity for the shell it projects, and im not sure how fluidic space friction factors into the ranges dictated in eve but i would argue at the very least that rails would require more energy to fire at longer ranges. so here's what i'm going to propose for hybrid ammo:have lowest cap need at close ranges and highest cap need at longest rangehave kinetic damage increase as range increaseshave tracking increases as range decreaseshybrid weapons would adopt a completely new tactical philosophy by being most lethal at long ranges, while most accurate at close ranges."
5/30/2011,"here's what that could look like:antimatter: 4 thermal, 1 kinetic, -50% optimal range/capacitor, +100% trackingplutonium: 4 thermal, 2 kinetic, -37.5% optimal range/capacitor, +75% trackinguranium: 4 thermal, 3 kinetic, -25% optimal range/capacitor, +50% trackingthorium: 4 thermal, 4 kinetic, -12.5% optimal range/capacitor, +25% trackinglead: 4 thermal, 5 kinetic, +0% optimal range/capacitor, +0% trackingiridium: 4 thermal, 6 kinetic, +20% optimal range/capacitor, -20% trackingtungsten: 4 thermal, 7 kinetic, +40% optimal range/capacitor, -35% trackingiron: 4 thermal, 8 kinetic, +60% optimal range/capacitor, -45% tracking"
5/30/2011,"this honestly sounds like a really cool idea, but would it make railguns too versatile? that seems a bit overpowered.what about blasters? they're hybrids, too, with emphasis on closer range."
5/30/2011,"keep in mind that they would be fairly ineffective at short range. they may be able to hit smaller and more agile ships with the improved tracking of short range ammo, but they wouldn't be able to deal considerable dps unless they switch to use long range ammo, which would only be effective against either really slow or really big targets. this long-range-only aspect would clash with blasters' short-range-only aspect, and make hybrid platforms especially potent at either long or short range, but not so much in-between."
5/30/2011,something like this already proposed:

5/30/2011,"i really wish it was painful being as stupid as this guy.is a drake the same as a ferox? not by a long shot.is a drake better than a ferox? yup...why?if they both had the same role, the tier system would be justified - but they don't, which means it's not just ships that get shafted for no real reason - it's entire playstyles.the breacher is laughably inferior to the rifter but flies completely differently. the only reason it's in the sorry state it is is, you guessed it, the tier system.if it was eliminated, you'd see nothing but greater variation. more viable ships = more variety = more choice = better game.having said all this, i am actually in favour of gypsio's suggestion in another thread of eliminating the tier system among bcs by nerfing the tier 2s. frankly they really are way too good for their cost."
5/30/2011,"the tier system is just a sorry excuse of not trying to balance t1. as a result, there are ships that essentially exist only for completeness. admitted, they have some flavour, such as minor speed and play style differences, but ""buffing"" these aspects would help considerably to see more of these lower-tier ships.ccp's method of selecting tech two models in the past was ""pick those ships with a cool model which are under-used"" (according to some document). how about balancing a bit to make the ends meet right where things start, t1. after all, in today's eve, a smart-ish player who follows the tutorials has a million or two after day one. it isn't like the old days when we needed to warp uphill both ways and mine veldspar to afford that mighty tier 2 frigate."
5/30/2011,110% true.wolves are after kiddies $$$$$$$$$$$$.
5/30/2011,i want that standings were visible if at pilots have mutual excelent standings
5/30/2011,"just change the default page to your standings with the character, and have the other tabs available for loading.less calls to the server and everyone gets the info they want / need."
5/30/2011,"0.0 is big enough as is. many alliances ""control"" vast swaths of space that they don't even use on a regular basis.the problems currently are distribution of moon-goo, truesec distribution, relative profitability compared to highsec l4 missions, supercapital proliferation, and blob warfare in general. throwing out more space isn't going to really ""fix"" any of these problems."
5/30/2011,i think the idea of a module doing all this is a bit over the top and trying to make it balanced as well as abuse free would be near impossible.i was thinking the other day though why couldn't you have a duel invite option.a bit like fleet invite you'd get a pop up saying xyz invites you to a duel. if you hit yes you both then form a fleet with each other and are forced to warp to a random safe-spot 20km apart from each other.you are now in the same fleet in a random safe-spot which in theory is a completely fair and honourable fight until someone can be arsed to probe you down.
5/30/2011,"agree, you should be able to repair you'reself"
5/30/2011,only when you are not engaged in combat.... then +1.at save spot etc i'm all for this one. prety lame you cant tbfh
5/30/2011,i will only support this idea on one codition!if you scaned down that pve ship and warp to the guy to finish him ( since he is already get good damage hit from npc ) all room instatly switch agro to you ( just lke sleepers do.)wanna easy kills? suck it!
5/30/2011,"i like this idea, new players could find themselves making money as a gallactic taxi cab. cause i know some people w/o jump clones in a system 30 jumps away would rather pay people to jump them there. and i know thats what autopilot is for, but autopilot will get u killed in lowsec and nullsec. maybe this would come when we can walk around in ships (actually said by ccp dev at fanfest)"

5/30/2011,"if you end up in a fair fight, you've done something very, very wrong somewhere along the line."
5/30/2011,"so, regarding ecm and how ****ty chance based mechanics are.to make ecm not chance based, make it always jam, with the length of time jammed being proportional to the relationship between the jam strength on the jamming ship and the sensor strength on the jammed ship.the next few points are inter-related.only one jammer may be active on a ship at a time, and sensor strength so that it scales more drastically with hull size.rejig the numbers so that jam strength is proportional to the hull size on which the jammers are mounted.rejig the cycle timer so that for the given paradigm of naked (no bonus modules), equivalent size hulls (i.e. cruiser sized jamming platform jamming a cruiser hull) and considering lock time, it's not quite possible to permajam, there is a window of say a second to two seconds to fire at the jamming ship. in pseudo-maths terms (jam time + lock time) < than cycle time of jammer. because only one jammer can be on a ship at a time, this means for naked hulls you can't be permajammed. rejig eccm and ecm boosting modules to roughly scale this ""slightly less than cycle time"" paradigm, so if both ships are invested then you still can't be permajammed. this needs to be further thought out as jamming ships will always be invested in boosts to their jam strength, so it's unclear exactly how big a difference there should be in the statement (jam time + lock time) < cycle time.all the above (plus the required number jigging for balance considering module load out) should result in a playing field where frigate hulls vs frigate hulls (or any equivalent hull size pairing) the ecm ship is good (and powerful when synergised with sensor damps), smaller vs larger hull is worse off due to the scaled sensor strength of the target (but still not useless as the smaller hull size means lock time is longer -> basically changing the ""jam time + lock time"" to be more dependant on lock time for protection, this needs number balancing of course).one consequence is that bigger jamming hulls will **** littler hulls, i.e. keep them permajammed. i don't think this is an acceptable outcome but i'm not quite sure, at the moment, what the natural way is to complete the circle without invoking arbitrary restrictions (it's 1:15 am here and my moment of brilliance has petered out)."
5/30/2011,"just get rid of ecm altogether. it's horrible and boring, for both the jammee and the jammer.my counter-proposal: replace ecm with something less all-or-nothing, roughly equivalent in effect to sensor damps and tracking disruptors, think up some sort of weird secondary secondary e-war for caldari recons like a shield resistence dampener or something, and the we get on with our spacelives."
5/30/2011,so... if ecm always jams...whats the point of having a cycle timer?
5/30/2011,he wants a way for his *insert frigate* to be immune to carriers.
5/30/2011,"didn't they always jam way back in the day, and then ccp nerfed it to chance because it was too powerful."
5/30/2011,"yes, if your points were higher than the target ship, they got perma jammed.i used to go hunting ceptors in my buzzard, pre the first ew nerf. (not this char)"
5/30/2011,"i would like to see ecm changed as well. the old system was terribly annoying and unbalanced. the new system is 'balanced' but still very annoying for both parties.personally, i would like to see ecm made more realistic while preserving some semblance of balance and getting rid of the annoyance factor.change the ecm system so that it functions more like real ecm.- remove 'ecm burst' modules. this will replace them.- radius / aoe based. optimal +/- falloff like weapons.- no target lock required.- jamming effect becomes a signature modifier. ships, drones, and missiles being subjected to jamming receive penalties to opponent signature size.- apply a 'stacking penalty' to multiple jammers being used in the same area.- script to make it directed/non-aoe. the script would provide a bonus to range, require the jammed vessel be locked, but otherwise work the same way.for guns/lasers, the effect would be computed and applied at firing time, and is pretty easy for the existing mechanics to cope with.for missiles, things are a bit more complicated. ideally, the system would cause the missiles to detonate some time prior to impact, with the chance based on their position within the field. realistically, that will be terribly complicated for the devs, so a signature penalty applied at firing time (as with guns) would be ok.this would make ecm less annoying on the whole for everyone involved."
5/30/2011,"combine the fact that only one jammer can be active on a target, and assuming you can get the numbers right, that jam time + lock time is less than cycle time, then you have a window before the module cycles again where you can engage targets, as no one else can jam you.something like that.perhaps it would be better for ""jam time + lock time << cycle time"", much much less, so ecm functions more like a consistent lock breaker but you can lock again well before the module cycles again."
5/30/2011,"i personaly think that ecm must be focused not at locking brake and preventing target from locking for some period of time.i think it must be focused on the ships rof and damage output just like dampners and and tr. destrutors do and not completely disabling ships ability to participate in figth. though this will bring new issue with it, you have to boost recon ships (namely caldari ones) for some extra surverability.just my 2 cent"
5/30/2011,soi can field 5 dronesecm alway's breaks lock (altough for a small time)i launch 5 drones and set one on each of my oponents.now there points drop and i can warp outi like it
5/30/2011,"how about adding to this patch:noctis is the ultimated salvager but a pain to pull out the loot out of the wrecks spec. when running ratting sides usaly clean up takes way longer then the site it self.so, since the noctis is spec. in salvaging why not auto. pull the loot directly into the cargohold. its kinda frustrating and nerv breaking open close open close container to drag and drop loot into the cargohold specialy in drone land since there is no bounty and you have to count on the loot.hopefuly you will add this future to the next patch ;)"
5/30/2011,are you truly this lazy?
5/30/2011,"its not about being lazy.as a example:put one carrier in a sanctum and one in a high end drone side (in drone land), while the first carrier can run two sides in a hr and gets instantly iskis, the other carrier is only able to do one side in the hr with cleaning and still get less then the first carrier makes in a hr plus he has to haul the alloys to the station, while the other carrier can constantly rat ;)"
5/30/2011,as a noctis pilot taht slavage is lvl 4 i know how its frustrating to loot 50 wreck one after another so i support this idea
5/30/2011,"and while your at it... put in one button for the noctis...just one.the button says ""i win""seriously... get out."
5/30/2011,yea this is a good idea
5/30/2011,"supported,but also our ships need to be connected to bridges and fuel lines and stuff like that, not just floating out in the middle of nowhere. and possibly see visuals like cargo crates and people traveling in/out of the ship. make it look real, immerse us in this ""sci-fi simulator""and yes everything im talking about should be client-side only"
5/30/2011,"i am pretty sure that if ccp would let the players create the clothes, paint jobs, own stores, like in swg-pre-cu-nge, alot of new players would join and thus would pay the bills.instead of milking the cow and creating microtransactions ...which is a step in the wrong direction.it is seriously a missed opportunity if they go thru with it."
5/30/2011,"aur is a way to get some plexes out of the market, a ""tool"" to stabilize a market and keep it at bay. but i like the idea about custom made paintjobs, it will require a special toolset of course, but it might end up as a great isk sink."
5/30/2011,"how would you do it without making eve into a bloat-ware product?all other mmos have a couple of thousand characters on a server .. eve has up to 60 thousand. the amount of data required to keep track of custom jobs will be excessive.only way is to make it client locked so that only the person with the custom job can see it, but then what's the point .. it would be like wearing silk panties because they feel nice but you'd never get to show them off (in normal society anyway).we may get corporate or alliance logos on ships at some point, but i seriously doubt finger paint ships will be introduced this decade."
5/30/2011,i would like to see a lot more player created items for incarna.
5/30/2011,"hmm i did not really mean infinate possibilities, i was talking about crafting like in swg, in swg, everything was player made ( well just as it was in eve :p ). so you train the skill, you invent the bpc, and then you paint the ship, like camouflage style, silver, rainbow, whatever :p so a finite amount of choices, but player ""made"", like industry works right now.same goes for clothing, you can make 3 types of toxito's, in 5 different colors = 15 possibilities ( for example ). surgery would allow you to alter the face, harcutting the hair, tattoo shop has tattoes and piercings, etc.some players would make furniture to put in the player owned shops, and so on.like player made content, just as it is now, but then in incarna :pit is a missed opportunity to not do it, in the beginning i thought this was exactly what they were planning, but i guess i was wrong"
5/30/2011,"that, and it is the first time microtransactions with a cash shop is added to the game, where a player can buy items/services directly from ccp ( well beside swapping character portraits and transferring characters, altho the latter is more meta gaming really ). just wanted to make that clear."
5/30/2011,"i see no difrence since its all same ****.the is only 1 rule ----> money talks !1)you can buy 28 plex every 24 hours..... sell price 10+ billion isk2)gtc are not even limited at all. you can sell how many you want.x 30 (60 days )gtc sell price..... 23+ billion isk.so you cant buy items directly from ccp but there is still way around in or out game.so as i said above its seems all same **** to me, rich kiddies have they toy's.suck it up!"
5/30/2011,"read all before postingi appologize in advance for the fact that theres probably another thread on this, but i looked for 20mins for one to post on and i gave upi propose that the ship/pos explosion graphics need to be updated. explosions are ultimately the visual goal of all combat in eve. when you see an explosion, youve either done your job or had your job done upon you. and for those of us who veiw video games as a movie you take part in, the current graphics are a complete dissapointment (well not really there is still a huge level of satisfaction gained from blowing somebody else up) but my point is that when you destroy a capital ship you should no see an explosion thats 1/4 the size of the actual ship, and then get left with the original model cept with holes in it. when the ship blows up there should be pieces of the ship of all sizes that shoot out in different directions, kinda like this picture."
5/30/2011,"we'll get new explosions soon: click. though i'm not sure how large blowing up ship looks, my duality character is la~me.but i agree that big ships should blow up royally. like with breaking on pieces which slowly drift away from each other for couple seconds (animated wreck) . but no way this will happen before all ship models got a redesign."
5/30/2011,"ohh wow, looks like they did update the graphics. but i will not delete this proposal untill i see proof that the capital ship explosion graphics have been updated as the 1st reply states"
5/30/2011,"nope, moa is one of the worst and strangest (""how the hell someone came up with this"" kind of strange) space ship designes ever made, it fails both in practicality and aesthetics. it should go.some people love(d) original scorp and maller, and were (will be) disappointed by replacement, but it's a small price to pay for enhancing overall look and style of the game. i think that ""neck"" part will be spared to save at least some part of old moa, but everything else right now is one big clusterfk of ship designing. i like how it looks on paper though, just like moa, falcon and kitsune, which three also look hidious."
5/30/2011,"nah, i wouldn't mind the remodelling of most ship hulls."
5/30/2011,fly a laserokh and shield tank.
5/30/2011,"my alt army still mines. macro mining destroys this game, you need to drop the price on everything, so the bots don't make any money out of it. remove plexs or increase there price. the bot owners need to see that there not actually making any money for this to exist."
5/30/2011,which podcasts?i can't listen to them on eve radio since noone's ever active during my non-work waking hours.
5/30/2011,"if you think about it everything nc new nc wanted failed, despite flooding the csm, anoms got changed, jump bridges got changed and well everything mittani and the rest of the scooby gang wanted didnt happen and probably never will hahahahaha.aww ccp, you guys are awesome, this is even more funny considering how smug mittani was at fanfest, never change ccp <3 it"
5/30/2011,"just a thought, but if ccp wants to encourage more people to live in 0.0 - get rid of docking permissions and replace them with a set docking fee that is paid to the corp owning the station. people wouldn't be afraid of losing all of their assets in 0.0 space, and opportunities for small scale pvp would exist at every station in 0.0 space."
5/30/2011,who sets the docking fee?why should stations accept docking requests from sworn enemies of the empire?
5/30/2011,"yeah no.if i dont want you in my house, why should you be allowed to pay me five bucks, then just walk in? or, similarly, thats like saying you could walk into fort knox or the us pentagon by paying an entrance fee, its their base, if they dont want you there, its their right to slam their door in your face.*edit* how about anyone who gets within 15km of a non-allied station in 0.0 is automatically pvp flagged against the owning alliance of that station? nah, jk, but really, no. docking permissions are great, but maybe add an optional docking fee with a corp-rank permission that allows free docking, that way corps can charge newer members, or just people they think have too much money, to dock with tehir station without causing an un-needed step for players they conside ""important"", or people running to hide."
5/30/2011,"yeah, face the truth...incarna is comming... and you won't be able to stalk that hot innocent girl across the station anymore since her alliance booted you and left a little note: ""perv"""
5/30/2011,"by the ""it's my station i should be able to decide if i want you in or not"" reasoning, then why can't you close stargates to just stop sworn enemies from entering the system in the first place? you can't simply because ccp doesn't want to restrict movement in such a fashion.i'm not saying that you should offer station services to everyone - but just allowing people to dock would go a long ways in encouraging more empire folk to at least explore 0.0."
5/30/2011,"2 reasons, 1) you didnt build the stargate2) from a scientific perspective, gates are in pairs, so if the companion gate got ""turned off"" do you know how hard it would be to reconnect it to its companion due to drift? (only giving a realism sciencey explanation because i was using real-life examples for my initial arguement.) and if you allowed anyone to dock, then you would have sovereignty space filled with people not in the corp using an alliances own base to mine 'roids in that alliances space, and when caught, retreating back to camp inside the alliance's own station, horrible. it would, yes, allow more people to enter 0.0, but also allow more people who come just to be annoying."
5/30/2011,your fears are great. wonderful even. you are actually afraid of neuts coming to your system and mining your rocks while your fleet sits helpless in the system.
5/30/2011,not gonna happen.if anything ccp should make 0.0 npc station services targetable.
5/30/2011,"personally... all i want out of it is the ability to raid their inferstructure for resources and isk. i don't want to take their pos's down or effect sov in any reasonable way. i don't want to remove their jb networks.all i want is to be able to siphon off some of their money. i want to ninja raid into a large alliance's territory with black ops ships and covert haulers, shoot something, load something into the hauler, and try to get out before they respond.i don't care if mechanics don't allow me to plunder whatever the structure is whole sale and take everything. i don't care if i can't plunder the thing more than once a week because of some sort of timer. nor do i care if i can only take a small part of a much larger whole.i want a clear cut definable objective for an op. ""today we're going to go hit this moon, steal some of the stuff in its hopper, and get out."". or something. moon, some new mechanic, whatever.just raid the large power blocks and annoy them. gnat stings, cost them a few billion a month in resources lost, and have some fun in the process."
5/30/2011,because we certainly have not heard anything in the main thread from them?are you able to shed some light?
5/30/2011,you must be living under a rock.
5/30/2011,anoms are a terrible mechanic and you're not getting your money-tree back.
5/30/2011,"""ramping up the sinks"" doesn't help unless you put the sinks where the isk is currently settling in huge pools, going stale and stagnant.so jo random has a huge industrial empire, and has more isk than she can spend. what is she going to do with that isk now? buying more ships isn't going to help, since jo has three of everything already. buying better modules isn't going to help, jo already has officer fits on every ship.the isk is just going to sit in jo's account with no purpose.turn up the existing isk sinks, and suddenly those people who have a hard time accumulating isk in the first place are just going to be hit harder.what we need is a new isk sink which will provide an endless stream of new things to offer the pilot who has everything."
5/30/2011,"that's actually a pretty good point  how do we get those traders who accumulated hundreds of billions of isk to recirculate their money? on the other hand: how much have they really accumulated in active accounts? most manufacturers and nearly all traders should have a rather small wallet compared to their total nav.personally, i'm all for an isk circulation which is as closed as possible, i.e. as few sources and sinks as possible. remove all npc bounties in null-sec and low-sec!"
5/30/2011,"even better lets just get rid of npc bounties in just high sec, since 80% of the eve population resides there. the biggest faucet gets the biggest nerf. that should take care of the fountain of isk spewing from l4 agents"
5/31/2011,check check still not fixed
5/31/2011,this. alllll this. c'mon ccp
5/31/2011,def. has my support!
5/31/2011,gallente ewar need to be looked at. the bonuses are crap on gallente ships. caldari gets bonus to strength of jam for example. lets have some of that love
5/31/2011,"nerf dramielsrebalance t1 ship tier system. battleship hulls should cost 70/80/90 mil isk, not 40/80/120. balance the effectiveness of the different tiered t1 frigates, cruisers, bcs, and battleships*either improve gallente ship speed and agility or improve range/tracking on blasters and railsassault ships are fine in frigate combat (except their price, they should not cost as much as tier 1 bcs), but desire to engage larger targets which is usually fairly dangerous with medium neuts in abundance. maybe their 4th bonus could give them a unique ability increase cap regen by quite a bit which would in turn allow them to wield cap neuts of their own. change ecm to work in such a way that the time being locked out is determined by signal strength rather than a chance based full 20s jam. in other words, if the ecm strength is significantly greater than the targets sig strength, the target can be jammed for the full module cycle time. on the other hand, if something like an ecm drone engages a target, the jam time could be pretty minor. this could make it worthwhile to equip ecm on non-bonused ships if the goal is to achieve short 2-5 second jam bursts. this could also make eccm more valuable because right now even with eccm random luck can still allow you to be jammed for the full 20s cycle.*while i realize changing ship cost (mineral build requirements) is a pretty big deal... in a lot of cases it simply does not make sense to fly something that isn't much better but 3x the cost."
5/31/2011,suggest complete change of ecm mechanics.make them similar to td's and damps in function ie. % reduction in effectiveness of specific ship abilities.i suggest making ecm reduce the effectiveness of other electronic warfare modules (any mid slot targeted module). i feel this would bring ecm in line with the other ewar modules by giving it a specific part of the other ship to screw up without totally making them useless. a td's ship can still point and web. a webbed ship can still shoot and point/web. a pointed ship can still shoot and move etc etc etc.might also reduce range of guided missiles... if reducing the effective range of webs/points/damps/td's isn't strong enough. if it was included it should be used with a script similar to how td's operate.
5/31/2011,"rokh. it's underpowered mostly because of rails themselves, but hybrid damage bonus instead of shield resistance might really turn it into at least more or less useful ship. it's a sniper boat, what the point of it to have a nice tank if it can't damage ****?"
5/31/2011,"this ^^ is precisely what is needed. the biggest reason imo, is for each individuals play style. a lot of ppl are cookie cutters, but there's also plenty of outside-of-the-box thinkers thay want to throw off their opponent and have a good chance at succeeding at it. pirate faction frigs: namely the dram, i've seen ppl hating, claiming op and so forth. well, i say no... quite simply i believe there should be ""kings of the hill,"" with the balance being it's cost, of which they are plenty more expensive currently. this is valid as greater cost = greater risk. yes, they are a force to reckon with and they should be, but ppl forget that a) these ships are available to everyone via public contracts, b) there are plenty of ways to kill them. ppl merely whine because they don't want to have to plan for them, but as i've proven, even a no prop battle badger can kill a dramiel: dram kill we could probably agree that, it's the pilot that makes the ship, not the ship that makes the pilot.thirdly, the hybrid weapon systems need help. there's been plenty of threads for how. from my readings and i agree, a boost in damage/tracking to make them a feesible choice given their short range (blasters), long range alpha (rails). they should properly fill those two niches, while having little glory in between. right now they have zero glory, save for maybe small blasters.lastly, a serious look into creating the dogfights we want > gank fests. an absolutely great idea, somewhere in the assembly hall here, was sig reduction per locked aggressor, to put it simply. the cross to it was it's logical reasoning, i.e. white noise makes it hard to lock said ship as more enemies lock it... thus giving fcs the debate of, how many should i commit to a single target as targeting would exponentially increase to worthlessness. now you get a need for more organized squads and thus more variable needs, tactics and dogfighting. honestly, i could care less about why it would be this way, ""the white noise,"" i just want to see it happen so we can have more epic fights that we all crave! this should start taking affect even at small scale pvp and not just reserved for large fleets.sorry for the wall of text, but this topic warrants it. i just hope this helps and is in time as i see i'm more than a month behind the op.thank you!"
5/31/2011,"so, how are you going to buff ecm ships to make up for the fact you just crippled their ewar? you may not have noticed this, but ecm ships (with the exception of the rook) tend to be very, very bad at anything that isn't jamming, unlike the ewar ships of other races.so, if ecm is getting a massive nerf, what corresponding buff are you proposing to avoid adding another half a dozen ships to the ""lol terribad"" pile?cost is not a balancing factor. don't believe me? just look at the current state of supercapitals.angel ships in general are stupidly overpowered and not even the most expensive things around. nope, absolutely terrible idea, as are all the variations of ""limit how many people can lock a ship"". why? simple - this will result in people locking up key members of their own fleet and making them nigh unkillable."
5/31/2011,"improve 0.0 station bonus's. not the ones originaly seeded (has too many slots) but ones player built. make it so that it is equal to pos manufacturing or better with upgrades. in mean time reduse price for station upgrades. kinda really silly how expensive they are. on this way it gets cheaper to manufacture stuff in 0.0 compared to empire but it is more risky. now industry gets buffed in 0.0 and peopel can start to create t2 production in 0.0. combined with buying up reprocessed loot or mins all u need now to import is certain moon goo types. spread or design a system that all types of moon goo can be get everywhere. ccp should make it so that a sun can be mined but no specific moon mins can be determaind as output. 1 day its xxx other day its xxx. for what i care lets call it a static gas harvester that convert moon gasses with a complicated process to random moon goo (make it so that its unsecured, interact with small gang ect put 2 reinforce timers on it something). now all stuff needed to t2 production is availeble in all 0.0. put it can be made just as expencive or cheaper (depends on station upgrades. this should make it possible to have local t2 markets. this would make 0.0 station more valueable and a strategic point in disrupting t2 markets. adding a screeny from my personal station cost exell sheet:station upgrade rules"
5/31/2011,don't forget an asteroid buff/replenishment upgrade for the industrialists.

5/31/2011,"industry can only be made worthwile in 0.0 for huge alliance blocks. there is insufficient demand to produce a large variety of items when you're in a small alliance having sov in only a few systems. we don't want changes that will only benefit the large blocks.and i don't see any major issues that will be fixed by making industry more attractive in 0.0.drastic changes will be needed to make 0.0 industry viable. when a few people turn to industry, that will draw people from other activities, thus making those more profitable..."
5/31/2011,"not sure where you are talking about. we build caps and super caps in null. other construction projects pale in comparison to that in terms of time, material, and effort. at issue is the margins in high sec are slim to negative (you could make more just selling the minerals) in some cases for smaller things. why build them in null when you can import someone else's poorly thought out industrial plans? so, the more stuff that sells for next to nothing in high sec, the more null industry can focus on building bigger projects.because many don't like working in groups and the less secure the space, the more you have to work together on stuff like industry.there aren't warlords, there are groups. the bigger the group, the more effective you are. if you think someone else is going to run defense for you while you make isk...t2 bpo? are you joking? that's just something people will farm simply because it would be a disproportionately higher profit/risk ratio.the problem that is most obvious in null is how risk is not distributed well in eve. a whole swath of problems in eve are related to this. if you want more industry in null that require more risk in high sec. that's really what it boils down to."

5/31/2011,"i vote yes.for things like:* faster travel - multi-jump journeys drive me up the wall, would love a way to hitch quick rides ship 'n all, this travel purchase should be restricted to hi-sec, not low or null.* a unique line of spaceships - stunning cosmetic ships, not wicked/badass ones.* cosmetic stuff: fab fashions and 6 inch heels for my diva in station, spunky colour hair-dyes (blue, green, pink, purple, etc), ship styling/remodeling etc.* short-term boosts to loot level during missions etc - something that would help vets/noobs alike.* interesting furnishings for my captain's quarters - carpets, paintings, flowers etc. not everyone in this game is a guy. (nudge - i came to eve recently, when i heard about incarna.)* the outright purchase of certain low level skills - maybe.* something i'd definitely pay for: the ability to train more than one character on an account at the same time!!!!!* the purchase of store only items like a pet that adds +1 to a certain attribute, eg cat gives +1 to perception, etc. would be nice to see a few alien creatures. one pet only per account character limit perhaps? just fun to get mitts on some of the furry beings that live on eve planets, without going over the top like other games. (though r&d breeding the beasties for mutations might be fun. :p)in my opinion, an eve micro-transactional store wouldn't be geared towards the microscopic percentage of kiddies out there who might have access to mummy and daddy's credit card. a micro-transaction store would be geared more towards players who want to get somewhere in eve without having to spend most of their non-working lives online managing stuff (that's why i like the idea of faster travel). depending on work and family life and gym time for many adult players, time can be an issue. if the store helps improve the quality/fun of gameplay for people with less time available, i think it's a good option - quite thoughtful in fact! apart from that, a micro-transactional store would be great for gameplay if it's got lighthearted fun items in it - eg the cosmetic/unique ships/pets/quarters furnishings ideas. fun items might not be everyone's cup of tea, but they would be optional, and in my opinion would make eve a bit less of a mancave!if an eve micro-transaction store is optional and doesn't give new players an edge over veterans with many years under their belts, i personally think it's okay. no-one would be forced to buy stuff they don't want, and ccp would get more revenue to bring more content to us. i see that as a win-win.i'd hope that existing items/ships etc don't find their way into the eve store. the player-made item economy in this game is one of its best features.on the negative side against micro-transactions - i agree that it would hammer subscribers in the wallet for even more buck$$$. this could be mitigated somewhat if the game's monthly fees were lowered, and if certain in-game accomplishments earned us amounts of free micro transaction money.that's my take because you were asking for player feedback. thanks for providing the venue! even if we don't all think alike, i appreciate that you care to ask. :)sapphire"

5/31/2011,"remember that blasters (particle accelerators) do also use the same ammunition as railguns. as such, sweeping changes like this are not looking very likely. also, from lore standpoint, higher range = higher kinetic energy. it's a military application, you don't want to dial down the weapon when you hit someone who's close.now, having a look at the different weapons:guided missiles pros: long range, usually high alpha, select damage type, tracking doesn't matterguided missile cons: can be shot down or outrun.fof missile pros: long range, usually high alpha, select damage type, no target lock necessary, tracking doesn't matterfof missile cons: can be shot down, outrun, cannot select targetshort range missiles pros: higher dps than above, select damage type, tracking doesn't mattershort range missile cons: difficulties hitting fast targets, can be shot down, can be outrun, low rangeblaster pros: high dpsblaster cons: effective only at point blankrailgun pros: extreme rangerailgun cons: low dps, low trackingautocannon pros: high dps, select damage type, no capautocannon cons: low range, usually fight in falloff (reduced damage)artillery pros: high alpha, select damage type, no capartillery cons: extreme range requires fighting in falloff, low trackingpulse laser pros: high dps, relatively high optimal range, fast reload (select optimal range), t1 ammunition is not spent by firingpulse laser cons: high cap usagebeam laser pros: fast reload (select optimal range), t1 ammunition is not spent by firingbeam laser cons: high cap usagefor a railgun fix, i'd personally look at the strengths. or the strength, which is supposed to be ""extreme range"". gallente are supposed to use blasters and caldari railguns, so perhaps increase the range bonuses for the caldari gunboats, allowing to use higher-damage ammunition at higher ranges. since the blaster optimals are laughable and railgun optimals fairly decent, a small increase in bonus would be significant at the ranges the railguns are ""effective"", but would not effect the blasters very much. this would mean that railguns would become the best long range sniping equipment (face it - long range means max lock range or over 200 km) and more competitive at the fleet ranges (due to ability to use higher-damage ammunition) as well as kiting (with tackle support) targets with short-range weapons at ""medium range"".alternatively, introduce a skill which boosts only railguns but not blasters (compare to guided missile precision). blasters or blaster ships may need their own boost, though, but it is highly dependent on other things, such as mwd/warp scrambler mechanics."
5/31/2011,"i'm not convinced by #2, but i think #1 would be quite a boost for blasters by releasing cap for mwd/ab and gallente active tanks.perhaps have 1 damage amount across all ranges? maybe with variation on the kin/therm ratio?e.g. all small ammo does 10hp damage.this wouldn't be the silver bullet for hybrids & their platforms, but i believe something on this theme would be a good step towards giving them a role."
5/31/2011,"i disagree with op's explanation of a railgun.a railgun is two electro magnets that pull a projectile forward and then switch off before it can ""pull"" the projectile back, you need a bigger projectile for more damage, because of magnetic saturation (why its pointless using massive amounts of energy with a small projectile)the majority of its power is derived from kinetic energy, but putting a payload on the projectile would most likely do more damage than kinetic energy on its own against futuristic armour types."
5/31/2011,"get rid of all railgun ammo, replace with one ammo type, then give the rail module itself energy level settings that increase cap usage (with reasonable limits) and range/damage at the expense of tracking.that would be more like how a railgun should work."
5/31/2011,"i would add that rails are primarily an alpha weapon and as such, would have a longer rate of fire to help against the arguement of it being op'd. it would further define it's role/niche. otherwise, this is all very good suggestions to the rails fix. well done!now, what about blasters? it should be almost the complete opposite, save for tracking as they would be designed for in your face fighting."
5/31/2011,the rails are a completed circuit with the completion being the slug. they form 1 magnet not 2. anyway this is a good idea
5/31/2011,"dear csm and ccp,i support this idea its really silly that the ship with the closest range are the slowest. the gunboats needs a optimal range and agility/speed bonus and the droneboats a dronespeed."

5/31/2011,i know it has been suggested a hundred times but still... eg:- un-learning lasts 10% of learning time- you can't learn a skill while un-learning- you get 70% of sps (or whatever compensates attribute mapping best)it's basically to get rid of those n00b mistake skills and not a way to re-characterise skillwise.

5/31/2011,"not supported. the mechanic adds to gameplay. you are not supposed to like to die. once dying becomes essentially meaningless - like it already is to the rich characters - pvp just breaks down. large scale conflict is essentially already decided by who gets bored or demoralized first. small-scale pvp (assuming it isn't dead yet) doesn't need to follow in suite.what would be next? losing a capship which took some time to save isk (losing a skill which took some time to train) by being afk in an anomaly (by not updating your clone) should be given back by ccp?if you really, really can't remember to do simple things like updating clones, i suggest you download evemon or some other character monitor software. those do have built-in features, such as reminding you when your clone is running out. then losing sp becomes even less like dying for going afk in as ""safe"" pos and more like dying for going afk while warping to a fleet fight - from simply careless to simply stupid.admitted, the ""automatically upgrade clone"" sounds okay, though there is an issue where you must be on a station with a med bay - which is an important distinction, since if you're able to upgrade anywhere, offices in stations with no medical facilities rise in value."

5/31/2011,"i have always upgraded my clone and i have never lost skillpoints, so i have a question. if you had 100 mil sp and you had only a 900,000 sp clone, would you sp go all the way down to 900,000 if you got podded?"
5/31/2011,"one way they could mitigate this is a severe financial penalty if you die with an un-updated clone. something like 10-100 times the normal cost of the proper medical clone. isk is more easily replaced than time, and there still is a significant penalty. if you can't pay it, then you face standard sp loss."
5/31/2011,afaik it has always been this way: you're losing a 5% difference between your total sp and clone capacity. the loss can not exceed 1 level (i.e. 5 -> 4).
5/31/2011,"not supported. this is eve online!!!never underestimate stupidity, ****** players lose sp, working as intended."
5/31/2011,"it is a good and clear punishment, if you don't update your medical clone, your highest skill is gone.it favors newbies over veterans, thats a good thing.it adds consequences for your actions, another good thing.i like the system.now lemme see, if i would forget to update clone i would lose 27 days, ouch, i better not forget :p( i did forget once, and lost 7 days or so, lesson learned :) )"
5/31/2011,"ty... my point was merely to show that it's the pilot that makes the ship, not the ship that makes the pilot. the battle badger was set up for cases just like this, to lure in ppl who think they're almighty noob killer ship is the pwn, only to humiliate them in this fashion. note the noob on the kill list was the drams very recent kill, prior to its own demise."
5/31/2011,"i've seen dram's killed by a helios... but that really doesn't mean the dram isn't out of balance for the frigate class. i think anyone would be hard-pressed to argue that the dram is balanced when compared to all t1 frigates, all inties, most af's, and most faction frigates. it has the best speed, the best agility, near-best sig, near best damage, and near best tank. its just two awesomely well-rounded, and people want it to have a vulnerability so its either an excellent inty or an excellent af, but not both."
5/31/2011,"you're right, it's a hell of a ship, and i can understand your point. have you ever considered that this ship along with it's pirate brothers are meant to be ""kings of the hill?"" their balance or offset is their cost; a greater risk of loss. you argue imbalance, but look at the price tag. ferraris go faster than pintos, would you argue that it's an inbalanced car? no, you expect better of high cost items, thus be our world. the issue, not everyone wants that risk... i.e. it sux more to lose one. so, what do they do? whine about their unwillingness to risk their own in a claim of imbalace of said pirate factions. worse more, they don't want to be bothered to plan against tougher ships. i've proven that indeed it can be done to quite an extreme... and tears and lols were had. so again, overcome and adapt... use your god gifted brain and seperate yourself from the common mammals.don't hate the ship, hate the pilots that refuse to adapt and whine."
5/31/2011,"1)read lore youll learn why cal and gal are so similar2) so you are tellin me....that you wanna give better long range guns to the only race that has super drones. seems a lil unbalanced. sniper sentry domis would be the only thing you see. seems a little unbalanced.3) so youre flying a cal gun boat....wtf? fly something else. unless its a rohk why bother flying it. and caldari already have a ton of long range weapons at its disposal. cruise, heavies and the likepoint is i believe the reasons rails suck is because thats the tool ccp gives us. minnie and amarr only have gun bonuses so thier guns need to be better to compensate for lack of drones or variety of weapon systems. once you think about it that way its not so bad imo."

5/31/2011,no. i like chance based and the other ecm working diffrently.
5/31/2011,"honestly, it would be better if the variable was a decrease in how many things could be targeted rather than how long they are jammed. it seems more functional. if you have 4-max targets and the jammer is even with the jammee then the jammee has 2-max targets for the cycle. if the jammer is dramatically stronger than the jammee, then they have 0-max targets.i think this would be a more reasonable change to ecm if you don't want the chance based component. it isn't over powered but still provides a useful niche for ecm."
5/31/2011,"or have a max number of ecm modules, which would in turn make people most like fit more multi spec jams if they didnt know what they were going up against.orthey more you put on the lower the strength of the jammers go. wouldn't change things too much and wouldn't affect eccm. they do it with enams and mag stabs why not ecm?orcompletely revamp ecm boats, make ecm short range like td's so the ecm boats have to be a lil tank combat boat rather than way off out there paper bagsso many diff ways to fix this problem"
5/31/2011,assuming there is problem...
5/31/2011,"i really like this idea actually.the reason i'm against chance based mechanics is that no fight (no matter the scale) should ever be swung by pure luck. consistent behaviour gives rise to tactics. inconsistent behaviour gives rise to ""because of falcon""."
5/31/2011,ccp please allow fleet logs to be exported again or device a system to do it automatically.you effectively broke a very useful way of keeping scores in fleet operations for mining.while you're at it also bring back the table layout of the loot history. this new format is not efficient or useful. nothing wrong with the older system.pretty please...!
5/31/2011,"win... against what? wrecks? it's not pvp where one person's gain is another loss. less time wasted and cheaper minerals is everyone's gain, especially for those fueling sov null blobbing. it would cut into mining bot income though, but that's okay."

5/31/2011,"it is past time that ccp fix their ""non"" mass component of eve. mass is real and has a cause and effect, ccp addresses mass in their ab and mwd calculations however they completely ignore the most important aspect of mass. small ships ramming into larger ships should both inflict damage and receive damage. anything in eve should inflict damage due to mass. mass has to be a factor: cause and effect. the excuse that people dont want to die every time they hit an asteroid is failits space, its supposed to be dangerous, and you need to learn to fly your ships without running into things or you die. my favorite example of just this argument is ccp' own storyline about an admiral ramming his titan into a station and killing both his ship and the station. that is cause and effect however, it is also totally impossible due to current eve mechanics. this blatant disregard for physics has unbalanced this game. look at all the possible tactics that could be utilized if mass had its correct effect in eve. titans would have to consider a mass charge of dreadnaughts as a serious threat to themselves. new tactics would need to be devised to prevent suicide freighters being rammed into stations, the whole sovereignty warfare dynamic would have to be redesigned. no longer should any ship with more mass fear being knocked around and bumped off of docks or gates because there would now be cause and effect to trying to hit a ship 600% heavier than your is, you die! please propose that ccp now address this most important feature to this universe."
5/31/2011,"basically what your asking for, is tat the exit corridor for the jita trade hub (and similar staions) to become a point of mass suicide? because with how many people undock, everyone would die.if tere were no problems that would arise fro this, ccp would implment it, fact is, only an idiot gets close enough to an asteroid to bounce off. the main problem with your idea is the stations, considerng ho expensive some ships are, people ould lose alot of money just undocking, and then gt podded by their buddy who crashes into them 3 seconds later. the only wy this mechanic could work is if your ramming a target your either currently:a) at wardec aganstb) at minimum currently engagig them in combatand even ten, there would be one too many issues with accidental crashes in trade hbs and a-hole just sitting instation undock zone with abattleship waitin for noobies to come ou ad rack up his killboard (or, at least, just to gref people for the amusement).there are probably more points im missing, or something i should have clarified on, but im too tired to continue."
5/31/2011,"there's been a lot of objection on the forums to the way supercarriers scale. between the effect of lag and massive alpha damage, it's difficult for a gang of supercarriers to be challenged by anything other than more supercarriers.so here's a mechanic that doesn't scale very well: local active tanking. there's a reason it's not popular in fleet fights. what's adequate to tank three players is useless when seven show up, and the capacitor draw is a big liability to energy neutralization.nerf supercarrier hit points. prevent supercarriers from receiving reps (possibly as a module to enable fighter bombers). and then give them an appropriate boost to local tanking. obviously, certain things may need to be tweaked. titan doomsdays, for example. but if you're looking at a way to nerf scaling mechanics, then active tanking fits. just look at dreadnoughts."
5/31/2011,how powerful active tanking are we talking about here?
5/31/2011,"leave supers alone. stop whining about them. they are fine, and there are more important things that need to be fixed."

5/31/2011,"well i suppose you can look at the vote count every time this topic comes up for support. and then you can make a note of how fast it goes down in flames.a small fraction of the eve population posts on these forums, and a small fraction of that number read and post in the assembly hall, so again that's a very small (and certainly unrepresentative) sample of eve players. i'm not sure what the point of trying to make such assertions is anyway, if you're right then all you have to do is state that you disagree and move on, as the torrent of no votes flood in. instead i see just a couple of people insulting anyone who supports this idea."
5/31/2011,"out of simple curiosity, i went back through this post to see what the general feeling about afk cloaking was, and tried to put the posters into the three catagories below. a few i couldn't place and some i guessed at based on their remarks.summary:for some afk cloaking solution: 17 (57%)prefer current mechanics or removing local: 11 (37%)not sure: 2 (7%)(rounding may cause percentages to not equal 100%)for some afk cloaking solution:gariboldi phironmatrixskye mk2thomas phillippekaelie onrenabdiel kavashseamus donohueswynetamy garzanryan starwingsveti antejohney walkerim super gayeperordev rombetter than youharrii karriemamba levagainst:baaldormars theranmystical mightmarlona skyrascaelshepard bookmurkelostlove hammerfoolish bobghurthemag'snot sure:aamrrt'raq mardonso i guess this should be proof enough for baaldor that most folk really do think there is something wrong with the current mechanics.edit: updated to add names"
5/31/2011,"not really. i can, as well as others, post with my 3 or 4 faceless alts to support / kill the idea. the point i was making, is that you see this idea posted quite a bit. and yet, it goes absolutely no where, ever wondered why?it has something to do with starting out in an emo rage, or it attracts hand wringing nerds and trolls (in which trolls feed on hand wringing nerds), sending your thread into a tail spin. i am not opposed to change, just as long as the change does not nerf the crap out of game play because someone nerd is wetting himself about cloaky pixels that may or may not be afk."

5/31/2011,"your missing a couple of the against column like mag's for example.afk cloaking isnt an issue, without local there is no need for the afk cloaking."
5/31/2011,"you're right, i was skipping over mag's posts by habit and missed him in the count. if there are any others i missed or misplaced i'll fix them, but it was more to give a general feeling for where these few players posting here stand and to see whether baaldor would accept evidence he suggested we look at, and not surprisingly he rejects even that.i respect your opinion and disagree. i think the game would be better if there was some (difficult) way to detect cloakers, and i think people would still afk cloak if there was no local (although certainly less)."
5/31/2011,"there would be no reason to afk cloak in the way its used now (unsettling the locals) if there wasn't local, yes people may still cloak and leave there computer but it would be for things like needing to pee. if the locals dont know you are there (no local) then there is no reason to afk cloak in its current form.i personally think your list is a little off, there are so many threads on this 'issue' now with so many people having argued against it before some people just wont bother any more because no matter how much they argue against a particular 'fix' the same idea comes up again about 2-3months down the line by someone else and the argument starts over again. it never gets anywhere and descends into a mud slinging match instead of an argument/discussion. then the cycles over again."
5/31/2011,"i've been thinking a lot lately with the extended downtimes and overly long responses to petitions, that maybe now is the time that the csm should start building the case for eve players to have a set of minimum standards from ccp that we can expect, and when / if (ever the optimist) they are not reached that recompense should be forth coming from ccp.now i know many of you will say well if it does go badly wrong ccp will look at recompense in the form of skill time ect ect, but if we look at this in the cold light of day, we are paying for a service, a gaming service, like many of you i love my eve and enjoy all the tears and lols that come with it, but i do believe that eve has reached a point where there should be a minim set of standards that we as the eve community should expect from ccp in regards to a number of key areas.i am going to give some examples below of my view on standards.1. a maximum time limit for petition responses that can be monitored and reported against.2. a minimum service standard for uptime, for example if there is a patch update and they give a conservative estimate of 6 hours to deploy and they go over that by a maximum additional time of 2 hours then a compensation programme should kick in, (possibly in the form of skill points and could be based on the additional time they go over, exclusions may have to apply for server failure due to hardware failure.).3. a minimum standard for engagment with the eve wider community and also the csm as reps of the player base.there a number of other areas that can be given above that would set a basic standard that eve players can expect from ccp.id be interested to hear what the csm think and other players, to a set of minimum standards, we as eve players are expected to fall within the rules of ccp and there set of minimum standards they expect form us, why should we not expect the same from them towards us ?eve is no longer the fringe game it was many years ago, and if as a eve community we are expected to move with the times, and engage with incarna and other nerfs that re-balance the game, then i believe we should also be able to expect minimum standards towards us from ccp as subscribers.thoughts ?ljb"
5/31/2011,"1) csm cannot force ccp to do anything, recompensation to long overdue patches.2) ccp sets its own standards based on subscriptions: subs go up, we're going the right thing, subs go down, what are we doing wrong or is it seasonal?3) eve, in my opinion, has never been a 'fringe' game but a 'niche' game - it's skill system being the most notable feature, as well as it's core value of 'anything goes, ganking to scamming, missions to pvp, and everything in between' (aka the sandbox). taking these three points into consideration, i'd suggest that the csm stick to its intended function of collecting player ideas (from the players who took the time to vote, or buy accounts for votes) and conveying them to ccp as the owner of the game. this is also known as a basic setup for shareholders, the difference being we're subscribers - and that's a big difference. as i've said in other places, game forums or the real world, 'if you don't like it don't use it'. now this can have one of two effects: taking the mmorpg aion for example, the american base by and large quit because nc-soft was unresponsive to europea/american gamer needs (less grinding in this case). the result? nothing...that game base has dwindled to almost nothing and remains so. the asian player-base continues to prosper, and with them, aion and nc-soft. ccp has a diverse market of players...but not nearly as large. as i said there are one of two effects - the other is of course the company changing direction relative to their subscribers demands. as a capsuleer, you have two things at your disposal in the real world - throwing walls of text at a company that can easily ignore or delete them (via yourself or the csm), and your subscription. a gallon of milk is rather high in price right now: so the town has boycotted the milk. guess what? prices are now down because they have nowhere else to go. is it fair? depends on your side - the point is change was conveyed through the consumer. as we all know large portions of the account base are owned by a few individuals - ccp encourages multiple accounts after all. to that end, multiple csm votes rest with one person...guess what? multiple subscriptions do too. between my friends and i we at one point had 14 accounts - that's $210 usd a month, small money to ccp right? for a year that's $2,430 usd...now we're talking a bonus check. the point i'm driving at is it makes a difference, though small. now let's take goonsquad and have them quit. now you're talking a dev's salary...or two or three, since we know goons each have 18 computer screens.too lazy, didn't read? if you don't like the direction ccp is going with internet spaceships, which is serious business (and money, your money) then quit. not ragequit, not 'can i have your stuff quit', but ""without us your company goes bankrupt"" quit. is it fair? depends on your side. considering ccp envisioned a zero rules sandbox game, i bet they'll understand - use that warp scrambler called ""my subscription"" and make your ransom: the standards you want to see, be they petition response times, hybrid guns, new warp effects, a fw system that works, bot reports, a barrel-roll function, or whatever you the subscriber desires. at the end of the day, if you're playing a game that isn't the way you want it, why are you playing it?"
5/31/2011,"is this a rl death threat??as to why i said that it shot over your head, the 'maroon' reference was a play on words, you obviously thought that he was being too oblique so like a dumb f*ck, you rectified it.but then again i expect that off you."
5/31/2011,"coloured text, didn't read."
5/31/2011,"supported, stations look lifeless."
5/31/2011,"because ccp really needs their devs spending all day approving designs and making sure people don't put copyrighted material into the game that could be a lawsuit waiting to happen.or, lord knows, the first thing submitted would be a ascii pen15."
5/31/2011,"you know, just having a corp (or alliance) having its own paintjob (though putting a minimum player limit on it to unlock feature.also, doesnt posting in these boards to suggest changes to the game count as player-created? or at least player-inspired? cause, these forums are more than you get in most mmo's, should be grateful. (i mean to say, at least you can try to have a say, i remember a certain mmo i used to play where the company did the exact opposite of whgatever teh palyers wanted, and the one time they all gathered together in a trade hub to protest the changes, the gm's random spawned and locked all the players in high level areas and banned quite a few.)"
5/31/2011,"also, as a miner myself, if one day ccp did correct and screw over the macro-miners, mineral prices would temporarily soar as the market empties (until more players atke up mining for the rpofits, then it returns close to normal). which would make capitals and titans much more expensive, meaning blob warfare would become extremely un-economical and inefficient, which could cut down on blob-warfare except with the biggest of alliances (and even with them, they would have to shuffle alot of their stuff to keep enough income to maintain blob warfare.)so yeah, do not legalize macro-mining, last thing we need is another reason to make this super-capsonline."
5/31/2011,"did i get this right? first, i need an alliance or other big group of players. the resident vote doesn't matter, since unorganized vote is utterly ineffectual. then, get voted as the ""mayor"" and then, sit on my posterior doing nothing except watching the money flow from the racket?so, to work in any kind of a way, the upgrade economy would need to be completely separate from the player economy, except the taxes. reason: otherwise, the ""mayor"" will raise tax to maximum, gather money, and then use the entire sum to buy a single cheapest-to-make upgrade from himself/alt/corpmate/alt's corpmate and pocket the money. only if there's no way tax money will end up in a player's wallet the system will be secure. and then it will be of interest only for people wanting to play simcity, which admittedly there is a good number. the only way the mayor could be rewarded is by a fixed tiny fraction of the income in the region, impossible to be modified. this would make it imperative to promote activity in the region and to keep the taxes low.on the fiction side, there's only one democracy in new eden: the gallente federation. the state is a corporate state (anarcho-capitalist oligarchy) and the republic is a theatre democracy, possibly aristocratic or more likely just oligarchic. the empire is, well, a theocratic feudal monarchy.the suggestion is somewhat close to the idea of viceroyalties that have been thrown around for a very, very long time. in essence, a group of players could gain a viceroyalty (development rights etc.) to a system. this could be done various ways, the best-fitting to the setting of which would be an auction. say, you pay a few trillion to be the next caretaker of jita, and try to set policies so that you make it back during your stay in the office. on the other hand, the bid to become the manager of nirbhi, derelik (0.9, no stations, no valuable ore, not possible to put up pos, located in the middle of nowhere) could be won at a minimum bid. amamake development rights would, naturally, be highly contested for their e-peen value.the balancing issues, therefore, are the amount of money moving and the size of the viceroyalty. a whole region is certainly too large - though people or better yet corporations should be allowed to bid for multiple systems. storyline-wise it does not make sense someone to be able to take control of, say, amarr or pator, so the access to bidding should likely be gated someway - possibly the same as pos (corporate standings, not possible to manage 0.8 and up). there is some issues here, specially when the caldari state has already sold the development rights (to npc megacorporations) to the gallente fw systems their militia once occupied."
5/31/2011,that's like blaming obama for the 2008 market collapse.
5/31/2011,"it's the same reason we don't tell people our pin or give them the password to our accounts. if you tell people how a 'lock' (the game) is made, then they will know how, and exactly where, to break it. secrets are kept secret for good reasons."
5/31/2011,"completely different issues, and ""not gonna happen"" isn't exactly a compelling argument. a much better way of saying the same thing, would be, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" -- that is, of course, if you actually believe that 0.0 space isn't broke."
5/31/2011,"no one said 0.0 isn't broke.it is.just not this part, docking permissions are fine as is, could maybe use more flexibility in permissions distribution, but hey, i don't wanna be greedy because there are more important things for them to look at then this right now. (also, im not a true 0.0 denizen, i just vacation there every now and then, and have never had any trouble fall onto me because i couldn't dock, just means you have to be smarter about how you play, and don't log off in a high traffic area or you will log back in inside the middle of pirates or really annoyed sov owners.)"
5/31/2011,"oh i have docked in almost every region of eve. it isn't hard to get docking rights in any region, through creative use of alts and corp changes. but it isn't about me, or any individual who has already lives out in 0.0. the idea is how to get more people into 0.0. that's one of ccp's stated goals, and many changes they have made have been with this as the goal. i am providing a suggestion which will increase the number of empire bears that are willing to give null space a go. ccp wants 0.0 to have real markets? the way to do that is to stop restricting docking rights.providence, back when cva ran the show, was a prime example of what all of null space could look like. i challenge anyone to claim that providence wasn't a kick-butt region, because it certainly was. (note: i've never been in cva or any cva pets and have almost always been red to cva with my main)"
5/31/2011,"do you honestly think you'd get more people into null by letting them dock in stations filled with people who would kill them without hesitation? provi under cva was an anomaly, none of the major sov blocs work under nrds systems like they did."
5/31/2011,"voith:no one is advocating that all fights are small.gate camping by a small gang is the problem, not the goal. what can a small gang of 5-20 do? gate camp. that is it, gate camping can harass another alliance but is not often a well defined goal and most gangs are looking for good fights. currently these small gangs do not have any other attainable objectives than harassment and picking of solo or pairs of stragglers. they do so until bored because there foes stop using the system(itel is onto your gank or a much larger blob appears and run away. this is not ideal for either party and not sustainably fun. now imagine something better.say for a station a small gang could achieve some tangible goal in system. the gang would form up go out and go towards there objective. the defending side would be forced into action or risk losing x. this would prompt defense fleets to actually form up and defend on short notice and maybe not reach blob size.you have no created an objective for small gangs, encouraged small gangs for offence and defense and improved sov warfare and made parts of it more fun than grab 1000 ships and lag fight each other and tally the tab to see who won. or maybe a module that acts as a cyno jammer that is deployable in system(would show like a cyno become so no hiding) the small gang can now go about there objective and a defense fleet would have to take out the cyno jammer before hot dropping the smaller gang.there are a lot of options, many better than my terrible ideas. the goal however is simple. make small gangs fun.how it is done is not as simple. you are right that we have to worry about small gangs having to much effect. we also need to ensure the mechanics of such can not be abused and cause inordinate effects to the effort involved. this is why i would like to see more discussion on this topic so we can provide the csm and ccp with clearly defined goals and objectives.halycon:that is exactly what i would like to see.i especially enjoy the bit about a clear defined objective.for the csm maybe a clear concise statement of what we want would be of more benefit. judging from the thread to many people believe small gangs just want to gank with impunity.statement:small gang warfare in 0.0 is lacking requires more small scale objectives to foster this style of game play. small gang 0.0 warfare should promote the following:encourage small gangs to form up, give small gangs rewarding objectives,enable small gangs prompt a response from other alliances. encourage gang on gang warfare.additions or qualifications to the above goals?i suck at writing these things so looking for some help."
5/31/2011,"i had a corp mate that had an interesting idea: player controlled incursions... the gist is, small gangs can deploy a device in a system that will cause incursion effects for x hours/days if the residents don't put a stop to it. this forces the residents to actually defend their territory rather than safe up until the gang passes through. and if they don't, they have to deal with poorer bounties, etc, etc... player controlled incursions"
5/31/2011,"so you'll be happy to share empire with everyone when they just pack up and leave because there's utterly no point in paying the sov bills then? i don't particularly like grinding anomalies to earn isk but all it'll take is a moon nerf to send alliance balances into the negative. and no, it won't impact any currently existing supercapital pilots because they'll just pull a pl.the future of eve: roaming supercaps in low and null sec, and ten thousand bots grinding l4's in empire to support them."
5/31/2011,"adapt or (die) move to highsec. you won't be missed. keep in mind pl is being funded by the largest sov. holders in the universe at the moment, who also happened to be based in the most worthless nullsec space this side of providence. don't rmt away all of your isk like vuk and co. so you can keep the bills paid and ships replaced."
5/31/2011,you probably would come and take it just to prove that you could but that is not really my point. just seems that if the moon already shows that it has resourses it should be able to be mined.
5/31/2011,"well, i doubt anyone makes serious isk from high-sec ratting ;-) but it would be interesting to know how much isk is made from mission rats in high-sec compared to belt and anomaly rats in null-sec.as for mission rewards: this is balanced by the loyalty store (there was a post by a dev sometime ago; i don't have the link, though). in fact, together with the loyalty store, missions are a negligible sink."
