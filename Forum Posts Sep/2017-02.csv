2/1/2017,"nope, pretty sure they wouldn't! ...but a lot would, precisely because it is actually fun for them. even though people keep telling them it isn't.perchance, from some exotic side effect the meaningless tunnel vision a gameplay directed entirely on the upsetting off a new player fresh into our beloved game induces, possibly thickasshiteitus or dumbasfuckementia, you may have missed the broad spectrum of gameplay options that are also available, including but not limited too, low sec, null sec, and let us not forget ol'scarry mcweary... wormholes.however, it would make:*1 - a lot of players happy (sh*t no! happy eve players? surely not) *2 - more people play and subscribe to eve online!(dare i relate to the op in this now hijacked let's defend the poor ickle gankers post)"

2/1/2017,i gotta say its nice to hear the csm really pushing hard for alliance bookmarks
2/1/2017,"i've never heard of referred to as the safety 'bar' before, thanks for the clarification.i understand where you're coming from, i'm just stating that ccp seems to have hit a roadblock with their plans to change bumping, and i don't know if it's going to happen in the foreseeable future. i would love to see more cooperation between smaller highsec groups but the gaps of skill and knowledge between wardeccers and newer players is pretty large. it's part of the reason i wanted to advocate for service advertisements so groups could look for that help they need in potentially fighting a wardeccer.i'm hopeful that some of the future structures coming out may further the idea of building up a corporation or alliance's space and hopefully create more incentive for defenders to fight... we'll see. appreciate your questions and support! i know you poke your head into c&p sometimes (i normally lurk there) and i'm happy to discuss these things with people from the other side. if you ever have any other questions feel free to drop them here or send me a mail.toxic"
2/1/2017,"hey suitonia, long time fan of your work but why of all the alliances would you join goons in npc space instead of pl or nc.?you do know that bigger isn't always better."
2/1/2017,"yup that's my concern, you're just another ""pvp centric"" csm candidate who might not be able to add some value concerning feedback about the pve fitting/ship meta. i'm worried that most balance on ship in the game is focus on how ship could be usefull in pvp (industrial excepted) without considering how those change goes on the pve side of the ship.loyal servent to mother amamake. @eve_tetsel"
2/1/2017,"i was wondering if you could answer some questions.1. at least one member of the current csm has stated that citadels make moving capital ships too risk-free. as someone who not only runs her own jump freighter service but is involved in alliance-level logistics, do you think any changes need to be made to citadels where long-distance hauling is concerned?2. a lot of people, including yourself, think that planetary interaction needs to be revamped. if elected and ccp seagull were to ask you what priority to give a planetary interaction upgrade, what would you tell her? should it be a high, medium, or low priority?3. ccp has made many changes, from new structures to the recent rorqual upgrade, designed to make null sec more self-sufficient industrially. do you think ccp has done enough, or are there additional changes you would like to see?4. in your thread, sullen decimus was insulted because you didn<U+FFFD>t know about the work that csm did concerning industry. honestly, i had not heard anything about any work the csm did on industry (or much of anything else) either. what do you think the csm should do to publicize their activities better?5. as someone who concentrates mainly in null sec, do you think you have enough experience to be able to discuss issues outside of null sec with the developers?thank you"

2/1/2017,"recruited a few corps did virtually all market stocking for at least a year did a large amount of the jfing placed strategic jc ship caches around had about 15 cyno alts all over eve in an alt corp with offices everywhere pre-phoebe to get us anywhere ^ generally just did any cyno chain with some help from a corp mate we needed for an op was acting ceo for the last few months before it disbanded handled all the logistics of owning sov in fountain fc'd several supercap ops generally just backup fc'd basically just the main ""useful people"" type dude for the time i was there. if you're not familiar with how larger pvp focused groups work, the best comparison i could give is doug stamper's character in house of cards. logistics > support roles in fleets > backup fc in that order roughly.they both need attention, but i'd say null sec needs it more urgently. null sec has had a complete overhaul in the last year and a bit, those changes now need review and iteration as there are some major glaring issues. citadel changed a lot in w-space, but it seems to have settled. what w-space needs is mostly qol improvements and minor-ish tweaks to get more people into them.ccp has various teams that work on different areas of the game so in reality it's not an ""either/or"" situation. for example there's a team that focuses in widescale game mechanics like sovereignty and faction warfare (who's name i can't seem to remember), and there's the recently formed team phenomenon who work on pve. null sec needs changes to the sov system and a lot of the main gripes in w-space are about pve. they can deal with both at the same time.it's a pretty unfortunate situation with no particularly great option. right now we have an enormous amount of code and tools written on top of the xml api that we can be pretty confident aren't going to get rewritten for esi as the people who wrote them don't play eve anymore. for example, evething (a sort of web-based evemon that's more focused towards handling a lot of characters and assets rather than just skill queues). that's a shame and as a community we'll all be worse off for it.i can also understand the decision to deprecate crest since there's apparently a lot of messy backend to it.what i do think ccp fails to realise is the effect this is going to have on developer confidence long term. the major tools like zkillboard, evemon, pyfa/eft, will all get updated no problem, but for smaller projects like the various alliance auth systems, my own tools, etc, it severely dents our confidence in ccp to build a coherent, long term and backward compatible api system. the direct comparison i'd draw would be that to microsoft switching their direction for gui applications every few years and leaving all code written for the old one totally in the dirt.the one criticism i'd have of the esi api is it cuts up information way to broadly. this is inconvenient for developers and also creates a straw for this own back. for example the location api you call to get a player's current system has 2 seperate calls. one for the location and one for the ship. why? there's tons of examples like this.as long as ccp stick with esi, it's a good system. the only major issue is a lack of confidence they won't. just speaking personally that's an area i'd have to defer to others. i've been been a big fan of primarily pve games. online multiplayer is what has always attracted me to every game i've played, so i feel like this is probably the one area i don't have much to contribute. i'm sort of okay with the current situation where it's basically risk/reward poker, but i can see why others wouldn't be and i'd be all for any improvements that still allowed me to spend the majority of time engaging with other players rather than red crosses."
2/1/2017,"well if you remember the open letter i wrote, there were 3 main concerns i had.1) they won't generate large scale content as capitals wouldn't be required to hit them.2) ^ this would also leave capitals without any real role in the game.3) moon mining is huge top down source of income that funds the activities for a large number of alliances.the first concern has been alleviated, to be quite frank, because i overestimated the average player. i'd spent a lot of time pitting individual or very small groups of capitals against optimally fit astrahuses and fortizars. primarily because a well fit astrahus, and especially fort have no problem killing a cheaply fit dread or carrier. also the fact the standup void bombs are pretty blatently overpowered. the vast, vast majority of citadels in the game seem to badly or entirely unfit and can't do this. against more experienced groups, it seems like you can just drop more capitals than are really required and write off any losses as just the cost of doing business. the fight is usually decided before the fight even starts.to the second concern, i'd simply refer you to this blog post i wrote a few weeks ago. the tl;dr would be that capitals now have a fleet role that allows them to be directly effective against subcaps meaning they are now just another step in the cruiser > bc > bs > carrier > etc progression.to the third concern, we've still not seem drilling platforms yet so there's not much to comment on. i would note however that the prices of r64 materials has absolutely plummeted over the last year, reducing their value immensely. i'd say that's definitely a bad thing, but the effect of it is that we've largely lost r64s as a content generator anyway regardless of what ccp do with drilling platforms."

2/1/2017,"can you specifically cite what are rumors on here? again you are generalizing overall comments as ""rumors"" you also have not answered or provided any ideas of your own to support your campaign ""ideals"".this ""campaign"" is nothing more, but a further troll by you."
2/1/2017,being banned from twitter is an example of one of the rumors posted here.i simply do not have time to cite them all.
2/2/2017,"just because you can make a simplistic assertion like the above doesn't make it true. there is no evidence that a large number of people want to play a no-one-can-lose version of eve with all the conflict drained from it. in fact, when ccp started to move in that direction and buff highsec safety and rewards is when growth in the game stalled and the pcu started to decline. even though this argument that giving people safety will make ccp rich is raised all the time, no one has been able to explain why ccp should double down on this strategy when all the numbers say it doesn't work. the much more likely explanation is all this safety just bores people out of the game. if you made highsec completely safe, you would completely remove much of the demand for players to gather and build things. in a game where your output is almost completely consumed by other players, those players need motivation to give you their isk. if everything is so easily available and immune to disruption, they just aren't going to need it and the game stagnates. i have no doubt there is a tiny fraction of players that just play to accumulate stuff, never interacting with other players who take satisfaction in just watching their wallet and loot hoard get bigger. however, most industrial-minded players play to service the demands of other players and play and compete in the giant single economy of the game. if you nerf the demand out of the economy by making pvp consensual and removing the competition out of the game by giving players a safe space they can all use to generate resources with no risk, you remove the meaning for much of what players do in this game. even hardcore pvpers only spend a fraction of their game time directly participating in space combat, but the demand created by that fuels so much of reason for players log in and to do stuff. eve online has lasted almost 15 years by ignoring the constant short-sighted calls to let players opt-out of the conflict and competition that is the life-blood of the game. what astonishes me the most about threads like this is that there are players that continually try to get ccp to do so. ccp knows what type of game they designed, and the perils of too much safety, and while they have tried the strategy of making highsec safer, it has clearly failed to spike the pcu, putting the final nail in the coffin of any movement to turn eve from a pvp sandbox into a standard theme park mmo. perhaps it is time for the pendulum to swing back the other way and for ccp to inject a little more risk into the game?"
2/2/2017,"csms,since you're meeting with ccp right now any chance you might get them to look into this:raitaru lab service are not functioningi realize this isn't affecting everyone but if you've got it, it's aids!"
2/2/2017,moved to player feature and ideas.
2/2/2017,"this account linking suggestion is something that will improve this game immensely and break the hold of the big entities, it is something that i have wanted for a long time as i have seen too many examples of spy alts destroying interesting new groups with dynamic leaders by easy to do theft and intel that enables major groups to take or destroy their major assets.in effect there are two ways to push account linking, the first would be to enable any character combination on the linked accounts, the second would be a discounted rate as compared to separate un-linked accounts, be it reduced price for paid subscription or more game time with plex.as an overall point of view the small more independent minded players have been penalised continuously in this game and it would be good to see their views get listened too instead of the big blocks.the issue here is quite clear, if big wig in pl/goon uses an alt to scam someone how can his actions ever have consequences if you have no idea who did it as he used a throw away account, i have the capability to go off after someones main if i really want to, but hiding behind unlinked accounts makes for stale gameplay, this also applies to afk cloaky camping, as i know who is doing it i can go after them too. it is a truly annoying part of the game that there are no consequences. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
2/2/2017,could you expand a bit on these statements. which areas do you feel have become to safe? which mechanics need to be harsher?which play styles could do with a bit more danger?
2/2/2017,"sorry, but this post says enough about your campaign. you're either gonna stand for all of us or you don't run at all."
2/3/2017,"how exactly are you quantifying ""a lot"".exactly how do you know more people will subscribe and play?eve is not terribly fun when played like one would play wow. you don't even need to team up to run missions. most people can run missions by themselves. so the teamwork one finds in wow or other such games is not needed in eve.what makes eve interesting is the competition between players. what you suggests is removing that....based on nothing."
2/3/2017,"it's not 100% true though.when i was new and young (2-4 months into the game back in 2010) i used to run lvl4 missions with loose group of players. it was just bunch of randoms from jel local who could make a fleet and run missions joining/leaving at any moment. at that point i had no 'proper' skills and ship (i was flying myrmidon with bunch of meta/t2 stuff, later i switched to dominix with t1 medium railguns). and teaming up was my natural choice.i believe nothing had really changed since then. new players still have to collect skills and missions are still difficult enough to make teaming work. i guess your 'most people' stands for older, skilled and rich players. but even players younger than 1 year would benefit from teaming up for missions."
2/3/2017,i would love for ccp to make one constelation 100% safe. limited resources a couple of level 4 agents and nothing much else to do. it would not impact the game all that much. the people who want that kind of space get it. and we can all put this argument to bed forever. the boring people can just hang out in those couple of systems and circlejerk all day long while the rest of use can go and shoot ships in peace.
2/3/2017,"perhaps you should re-read what i wrote. i did not say it is not going to ever happen, simply that it is not needed. if a player wants to simply play eve by running missions he does not need to do it with a team. he can go start grinding standings and take the time to get the isk and sp to run higher level missions. whereas in things like wow it seems that teamwork is a necessity.further, given the nature of eve teamwork is a strategy with low utilization. that is, people in eve are quite distrustful because if you have a valuable fit, there is indeed your ""loose group of players"" might turn around and gank you and take your stuff. can't really do that in wow. imagine what would happen in wow if you could turn on other players and after killing them take their stuff."
2/3/2017,"go play in rookie systems or the test server then.and the irony that you ""want to shoot ships"" but are pissed that other players want to shoot your ships. perhaps you don't quite get the underlying nature of the game. here let me put it simply:so long as i am willing to accept the consequences i can shoot you anywhere i want in game.those consequence maybe from npcs (e.g. if i use ewar on you in a mission the rats will start attacking me, or it could be concord). the consequences may be from other players. if i awox you the other corp members will likely do their best to blow up my ship and pod. i'll also likely be kicked from the corporation and made kos. that is the nature of eve you are never really truly safe."
2/3/2017,i remember back in 2011 we have had 'library' in our 0.0-based corporation. this was a collection of skillbooks under 10mil price freely available for any corporation member.i have never heard about similar things since then....

2/3/2017,"i was wondering if you could answer a few questions.1. i read on the forums that you believe force auxiliaries are too powerful. do you believe this is the case only in wormholes, or in k-space as well? what changes would you propose to fix the ship class?2. usually when players talk about adding a new type of bookmark, they refer to alliance bookmarks. you mentioned adding fleet bookmarks instead. why do you believe that adding fleet bookmarks is more important than adding alliance bookmarks?3. the vast majority of your forum posts, at least over the past 2-3 months, concern trying to recruit members to your corporation. do you think ccp offers enough tools for corp recruiters? if no, what changes would you like ccp to make to make recruiters lives easier?4. you indicated you have been a director or better in wormhole groups for the last 5 years. what types of tasks did you perform or were responsible for as a director?5. you have a lot of ideas for holding events to get feedback from players. one of csm<U+FFFD>s problems is publicizing what they do. how would you improve the visibility of the csm so players know about the events you wish to hold?thank you"

2/3/2017,"suitonia is a legendary eve player and as such would make a great csm as he has fingers in many pies, contacts, friends, and knows the community inside out. my favorite thing about him, and the reason i believe he would be great is that he is someone who has achieved much status without being overtly political or having a trace of ego, a really hard thing to do in this game. he has friends with all factions within eve (he does take sides, but has never indicated to me that he holds any grudges), and not many people can say that.i have also worked with him a lot on multiple evesports projects and he has always been reliable and given consistently top-notch analysis of pvp mechanics - he is the best technical analyst i have worked with and has an incredible capacity to remember all of the abilities of subcapital ships and modules in the game, and how they interact with each other. this is another fantastic reason he would make a great csm.+1 from me and all my alts."

(*)up until now, i was advocating that csm should represent the largest possible breadth of differenciated play-styles. this update clearly state that this is not anymore what ccp needs. the csm members are there to focus and structure the feedback from the community at large, the greater good for the greater player base.as such i have decided, as a player, to retire from this campaign. in the same way that i know none of the previous csm has really represented me, i do not know how to represent the community in general rather than the play-style i am familiar with the most. i am not a bullshit politician, and i am not after free omega account and free trip to iceland.of course, i want to thanks all those that supported my fight.this toon has been specifically created to be a public figure. as such i am going to put this toon for sale in the character bazaar between now and feb 15th, in case anyone more suited than me to ""brings focused, structured feedback from the community to ccp and represents its views and interests"" would be interested to pick up this campaign and register to run with him.

2/4/2017,"hello all,i am writing today to announce my decision to run again for csm, having arrived home from the last summit happy that i've done as i set out to do there. i feel as though i have both achieved and learnt a lot within csm xi, and hope that you will consider me for re-election, so that i can continue to work with ccp as a representative of the community. what are my goals?my goals are <U+FFFD> probably to no surprise to those who know me <U+FFFD> nothing to do with specific changes. i don<U+FFFD>t see that as a major part of the duties of the csm, and i<U+FFFD>ve attempted to correct that belief where i can. it is in my view, the job of the csm to first and foremost investigate what the fundamental problems are, then to present this to ccp.but, what i wish to do within my second term is much the same as i have already done;- promote iteration on stagnant features- provide consistent, neutral communication & transparency from the csm- ensure that as many points of view are brought to the table in discussions- argue for an increase in balancing velocity- continue to drive the csm-ccp relationship in a positive directionand, if you vote for me, these are the things i will continue to work on.what have i done?the strongest of arguments come with evidence, so i would like to simply share what i have done in csm 11 towards these goals,i have taken attendance (with the aid of the judge) on almost every csm meeting that occurred during csm 11<U+FFFD>s term, to ensure that people are able to see what their representatives are doing, and hold them accountable. it should be noted that this is not the be-all end-all of metrics, but it is a step towards transparency in the csm.alongside this, i have consistently produced a fortnightly csm update, which has evolved as time has gone on from a very basic stating of discussion topics, to a more fleshed out attempt to archive what we are doing as best as possible within the nda, providing a catalyst for community discussion with us on various topics of interest.i also direct <U+FFFD> along with other members of the csm <U+FFFD> the quarterly review, wherein every member of the csm is given a platform to answer various questions and ensure that they are kept in touch with the community.i have over the course of my term, also put together a series of roundtables addressing topics that i felt the csm simply lacked <U+FFFD> at the current time <U+FFFD> the knowledge to fairly portray to ccp. this includes two roundtables on hisec ganking from both the aggressor and defenders side (the recordings of which were kept confidential upon the wishes of both parties), wardecs (co-led by toxic yaken) and the new player experience. in addition to this i also ran a pve townhall, and participated in noobman<U+FFFD>s excellent wormhole townhall. i also suggested, ran and provided a final consensus from a nullsec content creators focus group. i have also been able to write and podcast extensively, taking a less neutral tack when discussing my own opinions on upcoming changes or problem areas within the game. a good example of this would be my <U+FFFD>safeties off, gloves off<U+FFFD> article, which i believe had an impact on the overall implementation of alpha clones, seeing as it highlighted the issues with the <U+FFFD>x omega + 1 alpha<U+FFFD> argument that the community was making at the time in the context of hisec ganking.i was heavily supportive of hyde<U+FFFD>s stance on balance frequency, and <U+FFFD> as shown in the 1st csm summit notes <U+FFFD> was heavily involved in the discussion around not balance particulars, but ccp<U+FFFD>s incredibly slow rate in dealing with problem ships within the meta, which leads to what i term a calcification of the meta, where something is so strong for so long, that every counter is explored, known, and solved. after this point, the meta grows stale, and quite frankly, boring.i consider the rewrite to the whitepaper involving csm 11, as opposed to csm 10 who were mostly excluded from the proceedings, a key indicator of the trust and co-operation that we were able to bring to ccp-csm relations this year. and all of csm 11 were crucial in achieving that, so i cannot take much credit here, but i<U+FFFD>d like to note it at least.unfortunately, i am not at liberty to say what things i<U+FFFD>ve worked to highlight to ccp in terms of stagnant features, due to my own squeamishness at the edges of the nda, and the sad reality that simply nothing may come of my efforts, as it may not be something ccp are able to fit into their schedule, or justify addressing from a business perspective. however, i would hope that my fellow csm 11 members will be able to vouch for me addressing a wide range of topics with the intent of starting meaningful conversations with ccp on them."
2/4/2017,"what do i know?in addition to this track record of communication and work within the csm, i also bring my own areas of subject expertise to the table. i have a solid understanding of both fleet command and the larger picture of warfare in new eden, as can be seen in various formats in my non-csm related writings on crossing zebras, and in the video content i produce on my personal channel. i<U+FFFD>m also familiar with solo pvp, specifically in faction warfare space, as can be seen in my solo pvp movies. i also use things other than frigates in nullsec solo pvp.i also have a broad range of experiences that i bring to the table, having tried out the vast majority of careers in eve before settling down in my current position in providence as an fc, running the gamut from mining, reaction farming, incursion fcing & pi work, all in varying spaces.how to contact meif you have any questions, feel free to ask them here. however, if you want to talk to me more extensively or privately, i am available on a wide range of social media;@jintaaneve on twitter@jintaan on tweetfleet slackjin<U+FFFD>taan//sanctity [cva]#9801 on discordjintaaneve@gmail.com is my email/u/jintaan on redditand, of course, you can directly mail me in game.thank you for your time, and more importantly, thank you for your interest in the csm."

2/4/2017,"awesome! i'm glad to hear that people actually like what i'm saying, i really want to be a voice for not just the wormhole community, but the entire eve community at large. i have a lot of interesting and thought provoking ideas i'd love to put forward and even if they don't get implemented, i just want to foster discussion on things."
2/4/2017,"i'm more than willing to listen to feedback from pve players, my passion is not pve and i don't presume to speak for them. if a change to a ship would cause serious concerns for pve then i would argue for them. goonswarm is a well organised alliance and i'm having fun flying with them. i'm a pretty prolific corp hopper though and i've been in pl, test, cva before too! i don't want to be in the ""best"" elite pvp alliance for the sake of being in the ""best"" alliance. i'm more of a solo guy with my own friends in a bunch of different alliances and i don't pick sides or hold grudges.thanks for all the kind words so far friends. contributer to eve is easy:"
2/4/2017,"hi, i am xenuria. i have arms. i also have an extensive education in psychology and behavioral analysis. while on csm 11 i used my diverse subject matter expertise to help ccp on their npe, branding and even some aspects of community development. i am running for re-election and would appreciate your vote. last season i had some really nice endorsements from people like minerbumping, /r/eve and several other communities. i was even placed on the imperium ballot. this season there are only 10 csm spots up for grabs and this is going to change the math of how many votes an outsider like me needs to be elected. i won't lie to you, there is a very real chance i do not get re-elected. many people voted for me because they were told that i was some horrible monstrous person that would end up being a cumbersome pest to ccp. i didn't end up communicating in csm sessions through interpretive dance like reddits suggested i would and i didn't run around ccp offices naked like certain other websites proclaimed with certainty. they voted for me to troll ccp and instead i put serious effort into a position that i care deeply about. my autism helps me see things differently, examine them without bias and motivates me to push myself. for somebody who has trouble with social interaction, i think i did a pretty good job this term.if you vote for me again and i am elected, i will continue my efforts to reform the csm and advocate for a increasingly better new player experience. if you don't trust me or don't think you should vote for me, or vote at all; ask somebody you trust what they think. there is a surface to all this, a thin nebulous thing that obscures deeper insights. i am actually a orb. official re-elect xenuria video"

2/4/2017,"1. alpha clones, rebuilding of the csm, csm > player communication and some stuff that is still under nda. a lot of the livestream stuff was something i brought up. 2. yes because over time you learn how to communicate more effectivly with ccp. you know who to chat with etc.3. at the begininning it was deffaintly trust with ccp. csm 10 was not great due to the drama so we had to rebuild trust and i think we did that perfectly. another big issue is sadly still under nda.4. focus groups work great when handled by the csm to help gather information about specific topics5. no was due to exams and some rl stuff. i still rewatched all the meetings and gave feedback on the topics that were discussed. also i agree that gambling should be banned, its just that at that time a lot of good things also came from gambling (event support, fansite support, ingame even supports) and at the time i just saw that all go away. thats why i was displeased."
2/4/2017,answerd your question.also application is in boys!
2/4/2017,"i was wondering if you would answer a couple of questions.1. in january<U+FFFD>s fighting in catch, your alliance, tactical supremacy, has had experience in both defending and attacking space in the aegis sov system. what was your impression of the current state of sovereignty warfare in null sec?2. for years now, people have complained about ccp<U+FFFD>s in-game corporate management user interface. your post stated that, <U+FFFD>more work should be done to allow these in game tools to supplement more complex custom applications.<U+FFFD> so what types of improvements would you like to see ccp make to the corporate management ui?3. when ccp announced the introduction of recurring opportunities back in april, you didn<U+FFFD>t like the feature. were you opposed to bringing the concept of dailies to eve, or was the problem with the content itself (kill one rat for 10,000 skill points)? is there an implementation of recurring opportunities that you would approve? if so, could you give a rough outline of what is acceptable?4. you think that the official eve online forums are horrible. how would you like ccp to make the situation better. is it just a matter of better moderation, or does ccp need to update the forum moderation policy?5. are there issues that mainly impact the autz that you would like to see ccp address better?thank you"
2/4/2017,"i was wondering if you could answer a few questions.1. you are running on an alt character this year. why?2. besides an interest in buying things from ccp in and outside the game, what are your favorite things to do in eve?3. you ran for election onto csm 9 back in 2014 as your main, aram kachaturian. what have you learned over the past three years that makes you a better candidate this year?4. you propose that players should be able to buy isk directly from ccp. in other games (gaia online as an example), that has led to hyper-inflation. hyper-inflation in eve would lead to activities like ratting and missioning becoming totally worthless. why do you believe players being able to purchase isk directly from ccp would be good for eve online?5. in ccp<U+FFFD>s development process, creating art assets is often cited as the main bottleneck in releasing content. you seem to want ccp to divert even more artists from creating art assets for space content to developing items for the cash shop. why do you think the cash shop is so important?thank you"
2/4/2017,"everywhere and all of them. its kind of an abstract answer but there is no mystery in space anymore, everything has become too methodical. there is a set way to do things now, min-maxed fits, optimized routes, intel-rich killboards. the main enemy to a dangerous new eden is the api. the api doesn't allow for creativeness, only for mockery if you do not do things the 'right' way. kill information should no longer be published and neither should the 'jumps/kills in last hour' on the ingame map.i am also willing to entertain the idea of a delayed local in nullsec."

2/4/2017,"i was wondering, what do you say to skeptics of your candidacy who do not believe you can win because of ccp's age requirement? ccp requires your character to be created prior to 26 december 2016 and you were created yesterday (3 february 2017)."
2/4/2017,"thank you rosewalker for your important question. my stance on this topic is that this is age discrimination and i wont stand for it! so don't worry, my lawyers are already hard at work on the case. if that doesnt work, i'll grab em by the loading dock and show them whos boss til they drop that nonsense!together, we can 'make new eden great again!'"

2/5/2017,"hello!my name is lorelei and i am announcing my candidacy for csm xii. i am running whilst focussed on high sec. i am a self-confessed high sec carebear and am proud of it. i have analysed the commitments planned/coming up in my life for the next year and have decided that i can afford the time to run for csm xii!i really haven't changed, neither has what i am thinking, (and therefore neither has my opening campaign post, really) and i am looking forward to discussing with you all!this is my campaign thread from last year:"
2/5/2017,"what is wrong with independence? this is a problem? is being in a group the only way eve should be played? should they be forced to be social? why would a carebear want to be part of a ""we"" in a game full of overly aggressive unpleasant types that you can't trust?why? what is the point? ccp aren't even interested in high sec players, they seem to only want people to join a gang and be f1 monkeys. someone playing for fun and to look at pretty space themed eye candy is not high on their list.told you last year, that moto is dangerously close to the moto of a known ingame ganker corp. not a phrase synonymous with trust.i did however vote for you last year, and will do so again this year."
2/5/2017,"thank you for stopping by my thread!nothing is wrong with independence... but plenty is wrong with apathy. especially if my fellow carebears sit around whining in local about this or that... and then do not try using the avenues open to them to get their voices heard.i'm sure that if there was a big enough carebear lobby, some of the issues affecting high sec play would have been tackled earlier... and before people start jumping around... i am not advocating turning high sec into more of a theme park.thank you!"

2/5/2017,"rosewalker, thank you for your questions. i hope i can answer them all below. sorry for the slow response, i got a bit busy with rl stuff past couple days.1. at least one member of the current csm has stated that citadels make moving capital ships too risk-free. as someone who not only runs her own jump freighter service but is involved in alliance-level logistics, do you think any changes need to be made to citadels where long-distance hauling is concerned?i do agree that citadels have made it more risk free to move capitals, especially with being able to tether to it regardless if it's a ship class that can dock in it or not (ie: cyno a capital on a medium citadel it can't dock in, but with 1 click you are tethered safely anyways) - which i have done this myself. a thought that i had was similar to stations and cyno's (when you cyno onto a station, you have a timer that you have to wait before you can dock up [if you don't think that timer matters: see video ]) - perhaps adding that same timer to citadels and tethering? probably not a popular idea there (and even myself , not going to lie, i love tethering <3), but it's just a thought that i did have on this instance.that aside, and on the next part of the question, i don't really think much needs to be changed in reguards to long distance hauling and i think the jump and fatigue timers do well in preventing be able to go from point a to point b in no time.2. a lot of people, including yourself, think that planetary interaction needs to be revamped. if elected and ccp seagull were to ask you what priority to give a planetary interaction upgrade, what would you tell her? should it be a high, medium, or low priority?i would say that it should be on high priority personally. it's one of those things that literally has had no love. the closest thing that i can think of as of writing this, is the poco's. it does desperately need a revamp.3. ccp has made many changes, from new structures to the recent rorqual upgrade, designed to make null sec more self-sufficient industrially. do you think ccp has done enough, or are there additional changes you would like to see?it's definitely gotten better for sure. it's hard to say what else i would like to see when we haven't really seen too much of the drilling platforms for one or the other new structures that were talked about yet. on the topic of drilling platforms, i'd also like to see how it would do things like reactions where currently we have to use various types of silo's depending on what we want. 4. in your thread, sullen decimus was insulted because you didn<U+FFFD>t know about the work that csm did concerning industry. honestly, i had not heard anything about any work the csm did on industry (or much of anything else) either. what do you think the csm should do to publicize their activities better?ccp has said in a few instances that csm has played an important role in the discussions related to industry and the structures, we also have the 'role call' that are posted of meetings - but i do agree that i would like to see more activity publicized (ie: who/what/extent), but it's hard to say because there are also nda limitations on what can even be discussed outside.5. as someone who concentrates mainly in null sec, do you think you have enough experience to be able to discuss issues outside of null sec with the developers?i do concentrate mainly in nul-sec, but i do feel like do have enough experience, yes, to be able to also discuss issues outside of nul-sec as well. while it has been a while, i have lived and done industry in low-sec as well as high-sec.thank you once again!"

2/5/2017,"hello there, i'm fawlty7, ceo of tactically challenged the corp and tactical supremacy the alliance. you may also know me as the eternal birthday boy.a bit about me:i began playing eve in 2009 at the age of 14. i am now 22 and haven't taken a single break yet. i have played this game through the period of life where peoples' personalities are developed and they are shaped into who they grow up to be. i feel like this gives me an interesting perspective of how much a game like eve can shape someones life, especially younger players. i also hail from australia, that desolate timezone that is autz where for the past 8 years where i have had to create content out of a very quiet and much more barren eve.in the time i have been playing i have lived in highsec, lowsec and nullsec. i've done mining, ratting, exploration, pvp, fleet commanding, fleet coordination, logistics work, pos work, sov mechanics, capital warfare and many other aspects of the game. my skills and expertise reside in fleet command and organisation as well as general pvp and sov mechanics and the things that go with them such as citadels, towers, entosising etc. i have also organised and attended many real life player meet ups and events, including venturing to iceland in 2014.my position:in the time i have been a fleet commander the meta for the game has changed more times than i can count and the nerf bat has been used so brazenly that leaves players with their last 3 months of training no longer viable. skill extractors help to alleviate this but it is not a great solution to this issue. when one meta rises above the rest, the creation of potential counter plays is a more ideal outcome rather than the nerf bat approach.since starting and running a corporation and alliance it is clear that the alliance system especially needs an overhaul. as a leader i feel like there is very limited options available that come with that power. there are no real options or hard coded game mechanics that the alliance executor can push onto member corporations, it is all done outside the base mechanics. an expansion on options such as voting to force tax rates alliance wide or direct taxing from the alliance to corporations. these are several potential changes that could shake up alliance mechanics.while the current state of sovereignty mechanics does make it easier for small alliances to potentially get a foot in the door, the current mechanics still make it easy for a much larger entity to push a smaller one out. i believe there needs to be more defensive bonuses for alliances holding sovereignty, it makes sense that people should have to fight tooth and nail to push long standing residents out of an area. citadels are also an emerging mechanic that has presented potential issues, especially for smaller alliances and their ability to counter them being placed by hostiles within owned space and their subsequent removal. obviously i understand this is a new set of features but i believe it is important to develop them correctly as soon as possible.those are the primary topics i feel strongly about and believe i have the experience to contribute positively to the csm with. i am more than happy to answer questions about anything people are curious about my views on. lastly the csm is a communication line, not a place for my personal wishes to be granted, so while i feel strongly about these topics it's not about forcing this at them, more about representing how these changes can benefit the game overall and enhance players experiences.i can be contacted in-game on fawlty7 or on the following mediums:twitter:"
2/5/2017,reserved for stuff.
2/5/2017,"i've known fawlty for years and he's been one of the most dedicated and prolific content creators in the autz. he's respected by all sides in any conflict and although he's young he's already got a better head on his shoulders than most people i know who are much older. he's a seasoned eve player, too, having handled more responsibility and gained more experience than the vast majority of eve players ever will.i'm happy to endorse fawlty and he'll probably be #1 on my ticket.p.s. happy birthday."
2/5/2017,"i've been holding back on my endorsements on csm candidates a little bit just to see who is definately running. this being said, without reservation, i also endorse fawlty7 as a candidate for the csm. to be put bluntly, fawlty is known for calling a spade a spade and will do wonders for both the community and the game.this being said, fawlty, how do you feel about timezone tanking?secondly, do you feel that your pre-listed responsibilities will negatively impact your ability to do the csm job, or conversely do you think that being a csm will have a negative impact on your ceo duties/fleet commanding?thirdly, do you think that dt tanking, or doing stuff with respect to dt, because you know its a get out of jail free card, can and should be addressed?(edited for 3rd question)"
2/5/2017,"<3 for the endorsement man, means a lot.timezone tanking from my perspective has 2 points, direct and indirect. for example, my alliance is 99% autz, therefore we play outside the majority of the games time. simply by playing in our timezone we are ""timezone tanking"", in that case it isn't deliberate so much as its unavoidable.on the flip side, there is always the option for groups to time their structures or sov based on their enemies prime time. this leads to interesting situations and opportunities. a lot of groups love to time their stuff for, funny enough, autz because it's so dead. it provides people playing in that timezone opportunities to have something to do. overall i don't think there's anything wrong with making your enemy come up with new ways to counter your actions.my current responsibilities are what give me the experience to run for csm in the first place. if elected i would have to take a step back from some of them but the ones that i am passionate about and what keep me wanting to login and run for csm in the first place will still be very much a part of my game time.compared to timezone tanking, dt tanking is a much more deliberate use of a specific mechanic. especially for us in the autz dt tanking has removed so many possibilities for content and possible chances of changing the landscape of regional power bases. so many groups use the safety net of dt to get away with actions that within any other timezone would end terribly. i feel that at the very least, dt tanking completely removes that timezone's ability to have a major impact in certain situations. i feel that a change of some form should be introduced that at least reduces the removal of risk for anyone attempting to use dt as a safety net. be that the addition of persistent aggression timers or removal of dt entirely."
2/5/2017,"i have known fawlty7 since late 2010, he is an immensely talented individual who has a very deep understanding of the game, most notably in 0.0, and though our paths have diverged over the years i have no hesitation in saying that he would make an excellent member of the csm, he was certainly mature beyond his years and has really experienced eve at a high level and is passionate about it, i would have no hesitation in putting my votes his way on matters pertaining to 0.0 and for looking at things honestly.in terms of hisec i think he would at least listen which makes him far better than most others i have seen. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
2/5/2017,"hi space friends,i am jonatan reed, or jr, of origin. currently, i console elo over skype when he loses a dota match, try to convince him to come back to the game, run his corp in our alliance did he say jump (dhsj), and i am here to announce that i am running for csm as a representative for all low sec residents.about mei have played eve since 2009, spending the first 2 years of my eve career in mostly harmless before the collapse of the old nc, and spent another year in the drone regions in the old irc coalition before joining origin. and black legion in mid-2012.since that point, i spent most of my time in origin and took a couple breaks to play around in wormholes and took a 8 month break in 2015 for irl reasons before rejoining origin. when white legion was formed. i subsequently started managing origin after elo knight took another break and have been managing the corp and being part of dhsj leadership and one of its main fcs.my ideal gameplay ranges from mid-large size fleet pvp down to solo.csm platformi think that a lot of focus of eve is on nullsec and ccp devotes a lot of resources to improving nullsec at the expense of other areas of space and one of the most neglected areas is lowsec. i think that the csm desperately needs someone who represents the entire lowsec playerbase, including faction warfare (fw).lowsec visioni definitely want to bring a perspective to eve where fights between entities aren't based on sov and massive fleets, but are based almost exclusively on structures and small/mid sized entities.citadels, and more importantly structures like poses and pocos are the crux of fights in almost all of lowsec.citadels and structures re-examination of citadel vulnerability timers - ccp plans to replace poses with citadels and the to be announced ""drilling platforms,<U+FFFD> but this will create a landscape of largely uncontestable structures that have mechanics that overwhelming favor the defender. <U+FFFD>drilling platforms<U+FFFD> - the proper introduction of <U+FFFD>drilling platforms<U+FFFD> will be critical to avoid the evaporation of a major content generator in lowsec. poses provide content by allowing individuals, corporations, and alliances to contest isk-producing assets in space. if <U+FFFD>drilling platforms<U+FFFD> are governed by the same mechanics as citadels and engineering complexes (i.e. vulnerability and reinforcement timers), we risk losing what is arguably the largest generator of content in lowsec. after all, asakai was fought over a cobalt moon. faction warfare even though i am not personally enlisted in fw currently, as someone who enjoys lowsec pvp in a faction warfare zone and has done it on a few alts, i think the following changes are necessary to fw to benefit both fw and non-fw players. suspect timer on entering fw complex: - i think suspect timers should be given to non-militia players who enter a fw complex. by doing so, militia players--new and old alike--will not receive a security status penalty for contesting the complex on behalf of their militia against neutral entities. this is especially beneficial to new players, as many rely on high security space to re-arm and re-ship after entering their respective warzones. resetting fw complex timers - i think that fw timers should be reset back if someone leaves the complex. it forces people to stay in sites or risk losing their progress, which benefits all pvp<U+FFFD>ers. increase lp from killing opposing militia targets - i think that more loyalty points should be awarded to players who engage in pvp with opposing militias by increasing the payout for loyalty point bounties. this promotes content by rewarding pvp over pve. citadels in faction warfare - i think that citadels should have fw system control lockouts applied to them as they apply to stations. a hostile militia should not be able to anchor and online a citadel in a system they do not control, and should not be able to dock in any citadel that is anchored in a system that is not controlled by them even if they are on the access list or if it's freeported. capitals examining dreadnaught role in current capital meta - i think dreadnaughts need a close examination to find them a new place in eve as carriers and faxes have cemented themselves as the primary capitals for almost all alliances in eve. faxes are enormously cost-effective against dreads, in that a normal t2 fit fax can basically tank 3 to 4 times its value in dreads. carriers exacerbate the fax imbalance with their utility between capital neuts and support fighters and their ability to receive reps and capacitor from said triage. examining the dreadnaught role in structure bashing - with the introduction of citadel/structure damage caps and the impending removal of poses, dreadnoughts will lose their niche in eve as siege platforms. a sieged dread is easily killed by a properly fit citadel. you cannot one-cycle reinforce a citadel like you could for even the largest upgunned pos. rorquals should not be jump hics - i think that rorquals need to receive a penalty of not being able to use warp disabling modules when they hit their panic module. overall tl;drspecific attention to overall citadel mechanics and reinforcement mechanics, how drilling platforms will be implemented, and quality of life changes in fw which helps the health of lowsec in general, and a look at how dreadnaughts factor into capital gameplay, and also jumphicshmu on tweetfleet slack as jonatan reed, or twitter as @tehroot or if you would like to reach out to me."

2/5/2017,"endorsing jr for csm. i happen to know that jr, despite residing in what some would refer to as larger entities in eve, actual does a lot of solo and small gang pvp. both of which have been lacking attention in the larger scopes of eve and i think jr will represent us well. fw is definitely something that has been lacking an overhaul for years. i remember back when my eve career started, that it was fw that started my pvp adventures, but it was also fw which made me look for greener fields and the mechanics quickly became dreadful and unintuitive. which the recent development focus on alpha clones, npe and other venues leaning towards attracting capsuleers to the game, it only becomes natural that fw, as often opted as the new player go-to place for first pvp encounters, should soon get it turns as the center of attention."

2/5/2017,bobmon got along well with everyone on the csm. the key thing about csm11 was the rebooting of the relationship not only within the csm itself but also with ccp. when you are picking a candidate keep this in mind as anyone you vote for should be someone that can get along with a group of their peers.bobmon can do that for you.
2/5/2017,bob has my vote for csm 12.he's always open and receptive to ideas that are put forward then provides clear feedback to what he presented to ccp and how it was received.

2/5/2017,"cheers for the questions, 1) the aegis sov system worked fantastically well for us, as an alliance our pve activities were spread mostly evenly across the constellation, keeping a 4+ adm in every single one of our systems. being on the other side of this in the past, in a war that was steamrolled, and seeing that we instead held against stainwagon for so long, aegis sov fulfilled its intention. from that, it forced tikle, the much smaller alliance to halt expansion and live in sov relevant to its size and carefully harass neighbouring sov and towers that were hittable due to low adm's and lax tower work.on this note though, the smooth operation of aegis sov vs citadels leave much to be desired. both our fortizar drop, and the continued astrahus drops by goons and stainwagon were utterly incontestable. with zero effort the structure was invulnerable to be a safe haven for the enemy for ever. these structures require no maintenance and =have a timer outside of our timezone there is simply nothing we could do.2) the in-game corporation tools do their job currently, this is great. in reality these tools and their revamps become useful when your corporations grows but it doesn't take long before alts begin crowding your list and ""last month"" means yesterday twelve times a year...i don't thinks its ccp's place to attempt to add jackknife or similar to eve, but i hope to raise discussions around these qol things and increased management (roles, titles etc) via the esi api3 ) daily opportunities in their proposed system, did not sit well with how i believe my timezone, alliance, corp and myself plays the game. we log in everyday to fly beside our friends and corpmates, to shoot the **** in mumble and link horrible memes in jabber. there may be places in this system for opportunities, but i don't see them being above abuse if sp is still the reward.what i would be interested in tabling discussions on, is dailies for collectables, exclusive skins and the like. with opportunities actually bringing a character out of its shell. are you a highsec miner? mine ore in lowsec! are you an avid pvp'er? run a data site! things that are both balanced in terms of being attainable, but require you to interact with a part of the game you may not have.4) the forums are a cesspit. heavy handed moderation is some threads, with 40 pages of vitriol in another simply being locked. the existing moderation team is either heavily understaffed, or afraid to act decisively with a few rogue agents. what the answer is to this, i can't say without being more involved with the moderation team. however, working with the forum moderation policy which has 36 individual rules is simply a well of text to read. sure ccp have expanded this over time to fit unique circumstances, but it is unwieldy and leaves much of the reprimand system to arbitrary permabans or leniency and this is before we involve the website terms of use...furthermore, both this post and the op is in breach of the forum moderation policy, since discussion of moderation is against rule 11. although cooler heads should prevail here in the hopes of a better forum for all.5) kill dton a serious note, i completely understand ccp's stance on autz. we simply aren't large enough to justify significant expense.what we are however, is a nation built on honesty and integrity, many of ccp's responses to issues are fantastic at aggravating this. a timezone with low server load and high latency experiences a bug, the common response is that this issue is unable to be replicated, only for the issue to get steadily worse and magically appear in a major timezone. cue slow clap from the autz as the euros and americans find a new bug!i also spoke earlier about the ability for autz to work around the edges of aegis sov, this is not possible with citadels and makes me quite concerned about autz's ability to continue participating.thanks for your time!-- ariel"

2/6/2017,i agree. why bar us from some of the tech i drones when we are able to get other tech i stuff? giving us the other tech i drones (especially the heavy drones to make ratting more efficient) won't break the line between an alpha and omega.

2/6/2017,"as a csm 11 member who had the pleasure of meeting and working with jin this year, i highly recommend and support his candidacy for csm 12 and urge all prospective voters to back him this year. jin's work as the unofficial secretary/spokesperson on csm 11 was invaluable in keeping the community abreast of what was going on in our discussions with ccp, all while maintaining the level of discretion necessary in an nda'd position. while many csm members like myself preferred a more narrow, expert-oriented method of gathering feedback, jin succeeded in the opposite and brought valuable information to ccp from a wide variety of players through forums like townhalls. jin is an extremely dedicated and passionate player and csm member, and despite his notorious inability to hold his liquor, is one of those guys that everyone appreciated having at our meetings and summits. i wish him the best of luck in his campaign this year and hope you all will consider backing him for another year representing the playerbase on csm 12."

2/6/2017,what are your thoughts on rorquals?
2/6/2017,i think the e war options in panic need to be nerfed. 5 minute invulnerable jump hictor is a little rediculous
2/6/2017,"well i started to go through your blog but i was onto page 3 of older posts and...i think that ccp should have a hisec carebear focus group which focus on making it fun for people who just want to play casual which would be a counter weight to the get them out of hisec 0.0 crowd hammering away at ccp. what do you think?personally i think ganking is in a good place at this point, except for a couple of things, the first is bumping, this makes it too easy and very annoying for the freighter pilot needs to be sorted. there are a number of ways this can be dealt with, but having a no consequence way of pointing someone for hours if they wanted is very poor game play. my preferred option is to put a bump counter on that after 20 bumps there is a an increasingly random chance that the bumper will go suspect when bumping a freighter.another change would be removing docking rights fro -5 or worse, there are now citadels in hisec, that will hopefully change how people look at ganging together and going after ganker citadels or those that give them docking rights. the astrahus and raitaru have to have better cap and improved defences, the missile system in hisec is too weak and needs improving, perhaps an alternative is some very effective rr ability on those citadels which will make people more likely to defend them.war decs, the system is in my opinion actually quite good, but need a few tweaks, the first is cap the war dec fee against major alliances, the second is give the locator agent the ability to say if someone is online as a request, but add in that if the agents corp has good standings with the player being asked about they will warn him of the interest, this also replies to the location request. i would make the war dec follow a character if he joins another player run corp within the week of the war dec, but on the other hand i would also limit the time that entities with less than 50 charactes can be war decked, perhaps two weeks max.hisec is made up mainly of people with support and indy accounts in hisec which is why it is so stale, but another reason is that people who are actually more hisec focused and casual, play so as not to be noticed by war deckers who they have no chance of fighting effectively. that is a statement of the issue in hisec, but changing it is not easy because as you quite rightly pointed out it is i rather than we that is the issue here. i was hoping that people would gang together to keep citadels alive but they are so weak and the issue of not being able to rep allies in the war dec screws that one, ccp needs to change it so that rr can be applied to allies in a war. i know that this will benefit war deckers too, but only when they come in as defending allies....anyway a few things for you to respond to, or develop further. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"

2/6/2017,"as an outgoing member of csm 11 who, along with gorski, primarily focused on mechanics, balance, and small gang/solo issues, i must voice my strong opposition to the candidacy of rhiload, and urge those voters who care about these issues to instead back suitonia, who is vastly more experienced and qualified, to fulfil this role on csm 12. with the reduction in the number of csm seats this year from 14 to 10, it is important that 'non-bloc' entities like the small gang/solo community further concentrate their top votes behind serious candidates that can bring a depth of understanding and experience to ccp on these topics, rather than wasting them on charlatans such as rhiload.the success and popularity of rhiload's meme video series 'zkill guides' this year is undoubtedly impressive and has at long last brought a particular style of comedy video popular in other games to eve. however, this success should not be misinterpreted as an indicator of his knowledge or experience on the topics of balance and small gang/solo pvp, but rather just as a showing of his ability to entertain and satirise. unfortunately for him, neither of these skills are valuable or necessary in the role of a csm member and would actually would detract from the hard work csm 11 did to restore productive and serious relations with ccp by trivialising important discussions on balance topics. despite his comparisons to me in regards to garnering a csm candidacy backing from videomaking success, i respectfully disagree with this false equivalency. i would instead draw comparisons between rhiload and csm 10 member wingspanntt (chance ravinne) who demonstrated how youtube popularity without any substance to back it up, makes for a hollow and useless csm member. although i certainly encourage his continued content creation which brings a smile to many-an-eve player, i want to warn prospective voters on the dangers of letting rhiload's comedic success propel him above his station.having spent many hours and days over the past year working with ccp to have game balance taken as an issue seriously, i cannot in good conscious allow an eve youtube comedian to get away with exploiting his recent popularity to masquerade as an expert on a topic he is not qualified to speak on. *i understand that rhiload may take this as a personal insult, however, i only voice this opposition because i care about this game and these topics, and have too much respect for the csm-ccp relationship to allow a meme candidate to detract from the serious work of the council. i do not know him personally and am sure he's a nice person and dedicated player."
2/6/2017,so vote for a goon as a non-block entity? did you fall on your head?
2/6/2017,i've flown with rhiload in last years at and although he might not be a master of game mechanics he still is a reasonable guy and knows his stuff (see his commentary work in at). not everyone in eve is concerned with the intricacies of the game and the main problem with the csm seems that it is dominated by huge power blocks and often the smaller groups get lost in the crowd. i feel rhiload being in a small gang focused group like tl he maybe in a better position to understand and listen to the feelings of smaller groups in eve right now.
2/6/2017,"thank you mr. grappler. the game is still very unbalanced. it's time for someone who cares about small ships, too. and i mean all small ships and not only the kestrel. o7"
2/6/2017,"hi hyde, congrats on the nearly 10k subs.i see that you feel that i am not up to the task and or feel disheartened about me running for the csm. but that's a valid concern , so let's get into shall we.i am no expert in game mechanics and balance issues in this game, i dont even say that in my forum post so where did you get that? i feel if both suitonia and myself was part of the csm, both of us can bounce feedback from the devs on how/why this xyz is op/not op. there is no doubt that suitonia is a much stronger candidate than myself in terms of game balance and mechanics, but i am not fully running for that position. (i even commentated the first weekend of the at, i dont know anything about balance or ships)i am running for a platform of low-security, i reside here and so its my best interest to keep this area healthy, i am not just running on balance and game design alone. you may take me for a joke, because of the videos i make, and that is a perfectly fine statement to make, in fact i want people to question this, how will people know i am taking the csm seriously? the videos i make point out the strengths, weaknesses, piloting tactics and fitting all in one, yes, they have an incredible amount of memes in them, but it takes knowledge of the game and ship design to actually make the video in the first place. ive helped people get into pvp, new and old, i give them fittings, tactics and other helpful suggestions for them, i commentate eve_nt, i've commentated the first weekend for at 14, if this is not getting involved or not taking what i do seriously, then i dont know. im here to give the little guy a voice to, small gang groups such as tl and various thera groups need someone to step up, gorski is currently not running and i would be worried for said groups to not have a representative in the csm, if there are, then more the merrier.you have every right to remain disgruntled and have opinion about me, in fact it's good to have opposition to a candidate, but i guarantee you, if i do get voted on the csm, i will prove you wrong."
2/6/2017,a solid platform to stand on! yums for space president!
2/6/2017,"my only question is: will you make poitot great again? when you are part of the csm that is.it feels like poitot's importance in the grand scheme has dwindled a little bit, especially to ccp it seems.what are your first steps in making a great and unified poitot again?"
2/6/2017,"so this meme is a bit tired, but i will try to pick it up and work with it, eh? if by poitot you mean everything good about npc null, yes i will do everything in my power to try and focus some attention on this space, space mostly forgotten by the devs. npc null is where ccp needs to be looking anyway for the current crowd, much more than sov 0.0. despite their best attempts, sov is still dominated by large, tired coalitions, and the few sparks of promising vigor have been promptly stomped out by ravenous power blocs, hungry for content. npc null is literally the dream of the current gamer crowd. what sort of games are jumping and jiving right now? well dota, overwatch, etc etc - games where you can take a small group of friends out for a spin and see what you are, or are not made of. that's the npc null dream - take out a small gang of your buddies and roam around, see what you can stir up, have fun, and then dock up and be done with it. back in the old days, when pirate battleship bpc were worth something, npc null was even more fun as the pve followed this model as well - the few deds out there created flash points for gangs to fight over, thus resources were acquired by activity, and spurred content. now npc null is pretty much dead - it can't really support a diversity of small entities sharing the same space, rather it gets bulldozed over by one large entity that controls the moons. it needs bottom up, accessible income to let people live the dream. lowsec has fw and l5s, 0.0 has sov-stuff, but npc null has...well nothing. yet it remains one of the last few small gang sanctuaries. if the playstyle was supported, things would be great.in building the new npc null dream, a few things have to be done. first, an income stream that is bottom up, and cannot be dominated by large groups and afk mechanics like moons, has to be created. it currently makes no sense that belt ratting via tags, and l5 missions, make lowsec many times more profitable than npc null. this would allow a re-colonization of the space, and small groups would be supported, and they would thus not spend the majority of their time looking for content, rather they could find it by logging in. most of the pvpers i know aren't moaning about jump fatigue, they are moaning about roaming fatigue - so much of space is empty, logging into eve is a chore not an adventure. if sov 0.0 is the arena for coalitions to fight on a coalition scale, then make npc null the space for small gangs to play out their dramas and struggles.i've lived in syndicate for a long time. entities like cas repeatedly voice to me that it's hard for their players to source income in hisec or on alts, and then look for play in syndicate. there's no reason why they should have to do that. when aegis sov doubled the escalation rate, it gutted a lot of income from npc null. if it were up to me, i would make the loot tables separate - escalation deds drop different things than scanned down, naturally occurring ones. right now it's just plain silly how cheap pirate bs hulls are, and the saturation of loot makes things just blah. re-introduce scarcity and rewarding specialization by separating the loot tables, and npc null gets a tiny buff. again, a lot of players do not want the coalitions of sov-space, they want a small gang sanctuary. i would love it if ccp supported all the play-styles out there. poitot is great again when npc null shines."
2/6/2017,+1agreed on all accounts vote fawlty
2/6/2017,"fawlty would make an excellent csm member, and it would be great to get some autz representation, so +1.what are your thoughts on how the server comes back up after downtime? it it better for it to be online quickly with some elements still offline (systems, markets, contracts) or slowly with everything working as it should?"
2/6/2017,i like fawlty7 he is a p.good dude.
2/6/2017,"downtime has come leaps and bounds in the past few years. in its current form it is bearable but definitely needs work. the fact that downtime usually ends fairly quickly but with several services lacking, considering the progress that has been made over the recent years, is a small price to pay. however the overall goal should be the complete removal of downtime."
2/6/2017,"having known of, then met fawlty many times, i am confident in his ability to confront issues head on, and be frank, open and honest when it comes to addressing any and all issues.for some of you who may have known fawlty years ago and have had no interaction with him since - his experience (both within eve and without) have given him a unique and wise perspective.that is to say, he has grown immensely in leaps and bounds into the level headed man he is today.fawlty would make an excellent addition and valued contributions to the csm, and you, as a voter, would miss out if fawlty were not a part of the csm."

2/6/2017,"for what it means fawlty7 has the peoples diplos endorsement. having though only known fawlty for the past two years, i think without his initial leadership back in the main autz squad in goons that made the game so fun for me i would have likely not stayed within the game. from getting to know him initially in-game to meeting him in reality he is indeed a strong leader and is not scared to let his opinion be heard. through all the things tikle has so far gone through, the fact that the alliance still stands and even after out multiple sov-evictions, most members of the alliance stayed through it all, to which i believe is a strong example of fawlty's leadership.+1 here."
2/6/2017,"nothing fawlty about fawlty7, good dude to fight good dude to drink with all around good dude. that being said, he does go on and on about it always being his 'birthday', says he gets lots of free crap from restaurants and he printed 365 fake drivers licenses with different date of births, so he can get free food and drinks and cheap tickets to the cinema. bit sad a (barely) grown man faking his birthday for attention :)"
2/6/2017,about time low-sec get a representation!
2/6/2017,"as a white man, i can 100% throw my support behind jonatan reed because, white people. thanks obama."
2/6/2017,"well, since you're apparently willing to do ccp's work for free, you'll have my vote. not because you're doing it for free, but because you're doing it right. but i still believe you've got scammed into this.but hey, you look like a grown up and the choice here is yours. se, be it."
2/6/2017,"ccp should hire steve already, but until that happens, he gets a solid +1 from me."
2/6/2017,"with most people you would be right to get a little weary of someone who has been on the csm as long as steve has - but he really is the exception to the incumbency rule. from the moment csm 11 stepped in, he was the font of institutional knowledge that we all relied upon to ease the transition period, and kept up that positive helpful attitude all the way through. his areas of expertise are those which very few candidates can offer insight on, making him a great representative for third party developers and market nerds alike. high sec and industry nerds need not look any further for their go-to candidate for csm 12 and i hope you all will cast your support behind the man - the myth - the beard - fuzzy steve ronuken."
2/6/2017,has my vote (again).
2/6/2017,"steve is an amazing man, and it's not just because he has the beard of a god. i pity anyone running on a market/industry/highsec platform, because you will never find a better candidate than steve. i can't imagine a csm without steve ronuken! he will be on my ballot!"
2/6/2017,"hello steve, thanks for running again. me, my alt and i will be voting for you.if i can pose a few questions;1) mining crystals is one of the most complex munitions in eve with a specialization down to individual ores. yet the refining rigs from upwell are simplified into primary groups. what is your view here?2) outer ring excavations is restricted to null sec, whilst sisters of eve and thukker are available within high-sec without restriction. why do you think this is so?3) the values of faction standings have been eroded with loss of anchorage and jump clone.what do you think can be added to restore the prestige of having earnt standings?"
2/6/2017,"i wholeheartedly support capri for csm 12. he is a level-headed and articulate player who will be able to build upon the successes of csm 11 had in restoring productive relations with ccp. he has two of the most important skills for any successful csm candidate: (1) understanding the real role of the csm and how council members should behave; and (2) proving well-written constructive feedback on the game without letting things get hostile. it is easy to complain - the playerbase is very good at that. it is an entirely different thing to be able to find the root of a problem, and propose a well-thought-out solution or change that benefits the game as a whole. i am confident capri will be a valuable addition to the csm team, and will be able to bring his particular subject-matter expertise to bear while also supporting other areas such as game balance and small/solo pvp. best of luck on your campaign."
2/6/2017,"heya folks, i<U+FFFD>m robin, my character name is kalbuir skirate and i<U+FFFD>m hoping to become part of the csm this year. in this post i will introduce myself, and explain my platform, credentials, passion, and focus. introi<U+FFFD>m a director at pandemic horde, where my focus is on our new player experience and our tooling & analyses (square). what this means is that i spend all my free time helping new players in various ways: i founded and actually run the newbean initiative (nbi) which is our <U+FFFD>new player<U+FFFD> helpers group within pandemic horde. a collection of super useful people who spend all their free time helping new players. i've worked hard to find ways to improve horde for new players, in shape of our flight schools, classes, centralizing information and ways to distribute isk towards new players. i<U+FFFD>ve discovered ways that enable us to help more people, faster, and more efficiently. this focus is the only reason we were able to cope successfully with huge influx of new players during wwb and ascension patch. to put it into perspective we handed out 10,000 ships and 50,000 skillbooks in the first two week of the patch. i collect and process feedback on horde specifically as a means to improve our alliance. i run all the industry for the ships that gets handed out to new players. finally, helping new players in-game (duh). it might not look like it but much of this collides with our tooling and analyses. this allows us to gauge if changes we make have any effect on metrics. we also automate a lot of mundane tasks through the eve api which allows us to spend more time on stuff that is important rather than tasks that just needs to be done. i<U+FFFD>m not going to talk too much about tooling as this is not why i'm running for csm. for me eve<U+FFFD>s api<U+FFFD>s, analyses and tools are a means to free up as many useful people so they can do what they truly enjoy: help new players. why the csmi<U+FFFD>ve had an interest in the game industry, online games and online communities for much of my life. if we go back about 15 years, it wasn<U+FFFD>t uncommon at all for a game company to have a council of players, class leads or community representatives. skip forward and to my knowledge ccp remains one of the only companies that upholds this practise to a high level. i believe in this concept and have a huge passion for online communities which for eve the csm is a vital part of. while it is a lot of work both for ccp and the players involved, it is my opinion that this collaboration contributes significantly to making the gap between players and developers smaller. however all of this stands and falls with having the right csm members with the time, intellect and motivation for the job. i think after 2015<U+FFFD>s csm a lot of us were starting to wonder if all the effort and time put in was worth it. i can confidently say that 2016<U+FFFD>s csm proved to us that they can be useful and contribute to eve<U+FFFD>s developments cycle in a meaningful way. for 2017 it<U+FFFD>s important we continue this trend and elect competent csm members.i believe i can be one of the csm members that has a positive effect on the game and provide something that i already offer my alliance, a funnel for feedback regarding new players. much of the analyses and ideas in horde are things that we can only take so far without running into game limitations. my hope is that by broadening that scope of feedback to all of eve<U+FFFD>s players we can work towards solving some of these issues or at the very least get them on the agenda to be discussed.importance of csm this yearafter phase 1 of the npe last year, 2017 is going to be a very important year for the success eve has with new players and potentially the future success of eve. from what i heard at eve vegas, phase 2 and 3 of the npe are going to completely change how new players learn the many aspects of eve. while i<U+FFFD>m very excited about this new direction, i also feel strongly that ccp needs all the help it can get to get it just right. i will say it again for emphasis: ccp needs all the help it can get to get it just right.you could argue that running for csm with a voting platform that almost solely runs on new players is a waste of everyone's time. many old players (cough bittervets cough) don<U+FFFD>t care about new players, and many new players don<U+FFFD>t know about the csm - well let's change that! the real kicker however is that we should all care. if eve is to exist for another 13 years. the npe that both the eve community and ccp provide go hand in hand with retaining more players. eve<U+FFFD>s biggest issue isn<U+FFFD>t pulling in new players; the issue is holding on to them and introducing them to enough core features that will get them hooked and in love with the game as we all are. in my opinion one of the biggest struggles of explaining eve is that both ccp and the community have been playing this game for so long that there is so much knowledge that is implied and accepted to be common knowledge that it gets skipped over when trying to retain or explain things to new players. luckily team genesis has been taking a good hard look at that and is definitely on the right track. if we look at the last 2 years ccp has been on the right track in my opinion with ascension. however, beyond that we have the smaller changes such as the adjustment of starting skills, inject all skillbooks feature, multi buy, multi-fit and skillpoint injectors that allow new players to customize their character a lot better than the character bazaar offers. there is a lot left to be done and i wish that there was more room for smaller changes like those mentioned above that would do a lot of good for the quality of life of new players."
2/6/2017,"i want to contribute to the npe as much as i can and feel it's something every player in eve should at least slightly care about. attracting new players to eve keeps the game going, creates more content and most importantly fills up the galaxy. i'm not running based on an idea that i'm single-handedly going to save eve or make eve<U+FFFD>s meta great. i think it<U+FFFD>s rather delusional that you<U+FFFD>re going to achieve that as a csm member. your role isn<U+FFFD>t to be a game designer but a player with an opinion and the ability to funnel other players feedback. instead, i'm running based on something i am confident in, have expertise in and care deeply about. i already spend all of my free time on the npe, with a lot of enthusiasm and joy, adding a csm perspective to would be another great motivator and something i would do with a lot of satisfaction. the key to the csm in my opinion is this: the ability to deliver proper feedback, able to keep an open mind about changes, but most importantly remember that you<U+FFFD>re not there for yourself but for the community. meaning that staying in touch and true to the community that is key. my expertisein two words my expertise and value to the csm are npe and toolingnpei can confidently say that i<U+FFFD>m one of the few people in eve that experiences the struggles of new players and works towards improving them daily. in the nearly 2 years that i<U+FFFD>ve been trying to improve horde<U+FFFD>s npe, horde has been improving bit by bit, tweaking and streamlining things to affect our retention and success of explaining eve. we<U+FFFD>ve come a long way but at the same time i feel i could quit my job spend 112 hours a week on improving horde and still have a lot to do. there is plenty of overlap between new players struggling in horde and in eve in general; such as the ui, what is and isn<U+FFFD>t explained, reliable ways to make isk and how they are taught (or aren<U+FFFD>t). however there is also a lot of differences, for one thing eve<U+FFFD>s new player experience in nullsec is entirely different from the experience in wormhole space, lowsec and highsec. i don<U+FFFD>t have the delusion that i have the answers on how to fix eve<U+FFFD>s npe for all these playstyles. a csm member is only as good as the people he is willing to listen to. i<U+FFFD>m willing to listen to everyone who can take the time to phrase his ideas and constructive criticism properly. i want to broaden my horizon by not just focusing on horde<U+FFFD>s npe but look at the bigger picture together with anyone willing to contribute to it.if going to fanfest, eve vegas and other fan gatherings has taught me anything, it's that there are a lot of smart and passionate people in eve<U+FFFD>s community. all of which love to talk about their space hobby (or job :) ). i enjoy listening to those people more than learning about new features or announcements, because that isn<U+FFFD>t what fan gatherings are about. in my opinion they are about making new friends, meeting existing ones and sharing a hobby. i want to listen to as many of you as possible and have some ideas on how to do this effectively if i am fortunate enough to become csm member. toolingas for tooling, being a middleware consultant and full stack developer in real life i am someone that looks at data as a valuable asset that supplements a process, the process in horde<U+FFFD>s case is turning a new player to a long term eve player. eve has such a wide range of publicly and privately data available that it becomes an awesome repository for analyses and tooling. horde uses much of this data to save valuable time and help new players. this is something i could write a long article about but i<U+FFFD>ll do that another time, a quick tldr impression you could obtain from the screenshots below. screenshotshaving spent almost 2 years integrating data and tooling for horde i can confidently say i have a firm grasp of the various api<U+FFFD>s eve offers(crest / xml api / esi) as well as the limitations and potential growth it could make.thank you for considering me as your csm member and please feel free to ask me any questions. i look forward to answering them.regards,kalbuir skiraterobin"
2/6/2017,"hi, when i heard about wwb, i finally decided to try out eve. i joined the game on trial account and within 4 hours, i was on the front lines getting blown up in ships provided to me by nbi, a program led by kalbuir. if it was'nt for the people in nbi, who guided me for 4 hours and tolerated my stupid and silly questions, i may not still be here. but when i experienced pvp and hundreds of pilots fighting in space, i knew this was the game for me and 9 months or so later, i'm still here.nbi gave me the skill books, the skill plans, and the ships to pursue several aspects of nullsec. pvp, mining, exploration,ratting and many other things (memes ). this allowed me to go ahead and give a shot at everything without there being any hurdles.everytime fleets went out at the time and when they still go out, newbeans are specifically encouraged to join and they get free ships. this culture has it's roots in nbi. despite the nullsec politics and horde's involvement, the alliance still primarily caters to new players. you wont be surprised that the leaders of one of the biggest entities in-game spend considerable time flying newbean ships and tweaking the fittings to ensure effectiveness of ships in fleets as well as the ability of the new players to fly them and make an actual difference and contribution in the fights. i cannot tell you how many brand new players i've seen who have been super-thrilled when their merlin tackles an opponent's ship for the first time and that leads to those ships being blown up. if you remember your first time, you'll know exactly the amazing feeling that i'm talking about. kalbuir, has been the point man that enables this. training new players is just one thing, training content-creators is also important and horde's leadership allows anyone to fc the fleets and actually train fcs too. kalbuir is being quite humble about the amount of work he does for horde and makes things smooth for us in terms of services that he has coded for us. kalbuir, you have been a great help, without the support structure that you established, i probably may not have stayed around in eve.thank you for the services. i believe your first hand knowledge and experience in designing and implementing npe is a great contribution to horde and eve community. you have trained 1000s of capsuleers and we're proud to call you our director.o/"
2/6/2017,"kalbuir is a guy who genuinley cares about this game and the npe. he has innovative solutions to even the most complex of problems, puts others intrests before his own and would be a genuine asset to the csm. the amount of work this guy puts into horde is insane and i have no doubts that his work for the csm would be treated with the same dedication. if the npe, api or just having a smart, hardworking guy on the csm matters to you, please cast a vote for kal."
2/6/2017,"i don't think it's any exaggeration to say (personal opinion) that pandemic horde would not be the force it is today were it not for the unstinting efforts of kal to try and make us the most effective group around when it comes to helping new players into the game - and then to retaining those players. i'm not putting down any of the other groups and small corps who help new players into the game, but i really believe we have a system that must rank up there with the most efficient in eve. please take the time to check out the screenshots, for example, and try and get a handle on what we have access to in order to help new players.kal devotes an inordinate amount of time to this. he is totally passionate about what he does, and he inspires all of us to be as passionate as he is in helping new players find their feet. i am a very proud member of horde's newbean initiative (nbi) and i devote some of my time to helping new players out. note, i said some. i have other things i like to do and horde lets me do them. kal devotes his time to the new players and to us in the nbi, to help us become great ambassadors for the game to our new members.a vote for kalbuir skirate isn't a vote for pandemic horde, it is a vote for a man who will be as passionate on the csm towards helping the new player experience for the whole of eve, as he is towards helping the new player experience for people joining pandemic horde and he will come at it with a staggering amount of knowledge and understanding of how eve works (and how it doesn't). kal will make a difference and it will help all who play this wonderful game.+1"
2/6/2017,kalb is a man.
2/6/2017,"acknowledging that being on the csm isn<U+FFFD>t about wish fulfillment and you don<U+FFFD>t really go there to give direction but to provide advice on a direction, feedback on plans and to help brainstorm <U+FFFD>what if<U+FFFD>s<U+FFFD> when asked<U+FFFD> can you provide us some examples of what your constructive feedback would look like on any current mechanics, functionality or balance you feel passionately about?i realize that's an open ended question without any specifics or quantities requested. i<U+FFFD>m asking because i want others (and myself) to see an example of your thought process, level of knowledge, writing style and hopefully balanced approach when talking about a topic you are passionate about. i think it is important that csm members have the ability to talk rationally and intelligently about topics they feel are important and can take into account play styles other than their primary chosen style. ie: can you represent (to the best of your ability) the entire player base on general topics and on topics that you have a greater knowledge can you engage in discussion that involves seeing the topic not only from your particular play style.other than the question above - i already like you because you do amazing work with horde and it has been a pleasure seeing you work your magic keeping our newbean chaos organized. thanks for all you do kalbuir."
2/6/2017,i am simply 1 of 1000s of success stories that could be attributed directly to kalbuirs hard work. but instead of bragging about all the kills ive been apart of (
2/6/2017,"greetings all,after much thought and discussions with my wife and friends, i have decided to finally put in my ticket as a candidate for the twelfth installment of the council of stellar management. i actually intended to start campaigning this year for csm xiii but i think there is no better time than now to see if i can gain more traction by running this year as well. who is kael decadence?well i<U+FFFD>m glad you asked. while you may see that my character has been active since 2006, i wouldn<U+FFFD>t say that i started playing eve online until 2013. like many players, i found a free trial of the game, installed it and made my character, and had no damn idea how to play the game. it didn<U+FFFD>t make sense and didn<U+FFFD>t play like any other video game i had ever played. so i gave up. every so often i would get an email from ccp letting me know that there was a free weekend for returning players to come check out the game again and see what was new, so i would install the game and recover my password only to be again disappointed and still not understanding how to play this game.it wasn<U+FFFD>t until i was in afghanistan for my 4th deployment that i saw on a real news source, something about an eve online battle that costs tens of thousands of dollars. when i read about the battle of 6vdt-h, i knew that i should take a second look at eve online. while i waited to get home to install the game, i took the time to start watching youtube videos and learn everything that i could about how to play before i even stepped back into the game.since then i have been in a few corporations while i learned how to play for really the first time, and took longer than i would have liked to start feeling like i got it. searching around on google for a ship fit one day for an algos, i came across a fit on a site for the high drag podcast. i knew what a podcast was, but didn<U+FFFD>t realize that this game had one. so i started listening to everything they had. then i realized there were more podcasts about this game i was starting to fall in love with. then i found eve radio and dj big country, the podside podcast, and so many more. i was hooked.one friday morning in germany (which was when podside with manny bothans aired live on thursday stateside) i was invited to fill in as a guest for my favorite eve online podcast, podside<U+FFFD>s thirsty thursday edition. i kept coming back week after week to lend my voice to the show, even when the time changed and it was at 4 am for me. i didn<U+FFFD>t care, i loved talking about this game that i loved now. i joined a wormhole corp with kazumi, one of the hosts, and learned so much more than i had to that point.after making the rounds as a guest host on ever edition of the podside podcast before it shut down, an appearance on the open coms show, and starring on manny bothans is primary, i decided to start my own podcast with meredudd. nearing its 23rd episode, our show is now over 10,000 downloads and is syndicated on crossing zebras. not only that, i have been a writer for imperium news ever since i started a campaign called eve an hour.why am i running?over the past few months i have been very vocal about how the game needs to adapt to allow new players to more easily learn how to play the game. for a long while, even before the new npe and alpha clone state, i had been adamant that ccp needed to make some changes to help new players get into the game. in 2016 i hosted an player meet up and started talking to new players (and recruiting prospective players) in the game, culminating in me starting the eve an hour campaign to help bridge the gap between veteran players and new alpha clones.it amazed me how many players were joining the game and were in the same boat i was back in 2006. they joined the game because of all the advertising on game news websites about being free, but just a few hours into it they had no idea what to do. i decided to do the new <U+FFFD>npe<U+FFFD> and started talking to people in the rookie help chat about it. from what i gathered by doing it myself, and from talking, nothing had been changed to really help anyone want to continue with the game. if that had been the npe that i experienced in <U+FFFD>06, i still would have left the game. it did nothing for me as a veteran, and wasn<U+FFFD>t doing anything for these new players. hence i started doing what i could to help new players find their way through the game.what i found was that the isd, game masters, and <U+FFFD>official<U+FFFD> representatives of ccp and eve weren<U+FFFD>t very helpful in the help channel and that the best help was found from players watching streamers and talking to other players. one day in rookie help i had been answering questions and pointing people to my discord channel for two hours before a gm finally chimed in and said i couldn<U+FFFD>t advertise my unbiased help in a help channel. two hours and i was the only person giving help and advise in a help channel before i was told that i wasn<U+FFFD>t allowed to give that help.if i wasn<U+FFFD>t vocal about my desire to help new people before then, i was now. so if i have a platform at all, its to help new players. this is what i want to do."
2/6/2017,"what will i do if elected?- be a voice for those who still are learning to speak- be in a position where my help is taken more seriously and be legitimate- advocate on behalf of new players and help make the game more easily learned- show veteran players that its not their way or the space highwaylook, i know being a csm doesn<U+FFFD>t mean being a junior dev. i know that i can<U+FFFD>t force changes onto ccp. what i can be is be a voice of reason when the developers are planning on, or have done something, that just doesn<U+FFFD>t work for the entire player base. having lived in every area of new eden and tried my hand at everything, and having gone through the rough self taught method that i did, i feel that i am more able to present the ideas and frustrations that a new player might have. in some respects, i still consider myself new and have so much more to learn, but at the same time i think my perspective and viewpoint is enough in line with the alpha mindset that i can effect and provoke a strong dialogue. that is really what i want to be able to do, open the dialogue and bridge the gap between the old and new as i am somewhere in between.how to contact mealthough i have made myself very accessible, there are probably a lot of people who don<U+FFFD>t know how to contact me and might want to ask me questions. if you want to chat or ask about my thoughts on what i can do for you and csm, reach out to me though the following methods;@kaeldecadence on twitter@kaeldecadence on tweetfleet slackkael decadence#0732 on discordkaeldecadence@gmail.com/u/kaeldecadence on redditand you can always reach out to me in game or here on the forums.thank you for reading my post and i wish good luck to all of the candidates for this csm session."

2/7/2017,"aegis sov - goals note quite reached.so aegis sov set out with the idea that the large scale bloated renter and vassal empires were not conducive vibrant new eden, and the goal that they should be forced apart via the stress and strain of the defense and vulnerability mandates that the entosis and adm mechanics force upon them. however, coupled with a few quality of life changes, in conjunction with ship balance updates, it has instead had quite the opposite effect - the empires have gotten larger and more condensed, with the end result being the same - most sov is rather stagnant.when they decided to put more anomalies in systems, and more high quality anomalies in lower tru-sec systems, it may have been designed with the intent to make some space desirable, as for the longest time entire regions were considered worthless thanks to low truesec. what it did, at least from my viewpoint, was allow a compression of space - entities can have much more ratting per system, and support many more players with far fewer systems. on one hand this is good, on the other hand liabilities do not grow linearly as entity size does - entities do not need to spread out as they get bigger and incur more vulnerabilities and organizational stress. basically instead of leaning down the monolithic entities, it actively allowed them control over just as many players in a more consolidated fashion.then they rebalanced the roqual. on one hand, they needed to make it defensible enough that people in all parts of sov space would find it usable - its use couldn't just be the domain of incredibly large monolithic entities. on the other, in doing so, they created another one of these horrible problems of scale for which they should know better. slowcats are a prime example - a handful of remote rep carriers were not a balancing problem, but 200 of them absolutely were. lone rorquals are somewhat threatened, but large groups of rorquals in hardened space are practically invulnerable. topping this all off, unlike ratting anomalies where one attains the optimal isk/hr by soloing them, many rorquals may comfortably share an ore site, making even easier to defend large fleets of these. essentially, you can now cram more players into a sov system, doing safer activities, which scale and pay better, than ever before, meaning the empires' footprints on the map may be shrinking, but they are just as monolithic as before, if not worse. aegis sov was supposed to increase strain on larger organizations, but now more than ever they have an easier time holding even more players with fewer liabilities. mayhaps there are open spots on the map, but they are not really open in a game when numbers mean everything, and player monopolies are even more easily held."
2/7/2017,"wardecs - content seeds in salted fields. good mechanics are like seeds. if they are carefully nurtured by players, they present an opportunity to grow into content, likewise if players see no fruitful end, they will simply discard the seed to the wind. the problem with wardecs currently can be summed up as much - both involved parties involved in them rarely see a potential end they would like to work for, so they typically grow into nothing. everyone wants more people undocked, more things to fight for, more things to get, and more things to lose - every mechanic that encourages participation is good for the game.it's time to make wardecs produce, rather than stifle content.say i belong to a dedicated pve corp in high sec. on their weekly rotation, one of the large wardec corporations wardecs my mission running corp. the best solution would be to simply drop corp until they are done with their dec. if you did rally the troops, possibly even get allies and friends to assist you, possibly even hired mercenaries, the wardeccers have nothing on the table - they would just dock up. the war is unwinnable from the start because there is no way to actually force the attacker to commit, no way to actually end the war, and the attacker has nothing on the table to lose. once again i go to my starting statement - content seeds are fruitful when both sides see an outcome they want.say my own alliance is wardecced. maybe it's any other alliance that lives in low or null. the best solution is again, drop to an npc corp, or use out of alliance alts. if we did bring a fleet to highsec looking for a fight, it's plainly obvious we would not get one - the wardeccers would dock up. once again, both parties cannot see an end they would like to work towards. in this case low or null dwellers want a fight, and most likely would not get one. in the former case, the hs dwellers want to mine or mission, but cannot do so, and cannot actually force a situation where they can do so again, regardless of how much they rally. either way, the best solution is non-participation, which is a net loss for new eden.things work differently in a different rule set. even a tiny ante like a reinforced pos or poco can spark massive conflicts in low or null, and a good deal of this is because all involved parties have something they want out of the situation - participation is the best solution. if there was a way to force an end to the war, or create real risk for blindly deccing most of the game, then more than one party may have something they want out of the situation, and participation will be a better strategy. there are a lot of proposed solutions as to the nature and size of what wardeccers should risk to wardec. ultimately, the solution must make the decced party's best solution be participation or it is not a solution at all. however, the wardeccers must realize too, that people are not going to participate unless they can actually inflict real punishment of some sort for the inconvenience they caused - what do they have to gain by nurturing this content seed?"

2/7/2017,"'current mechanics still make it easy for a much larger entity to push a smaller one out. i believe there needs to be more defensive bonuses for alliances holding sovereignty, it makes sense that people should have to fight tooth and nail to push long standing residents out of an area. citadels are also an emerging mechanic that has presented potential issues, especially for smaller alliances and their ability to counter them being placed by hostiles within owned space'do you believe longevity of a group's existence in some area means they deserve to have advantages to holding it beyond what's already in the game? what advantages might those be? how would you ameliorate the impact of greater numbers on a smaller entity in taking of space? what increments would they kick in at, or would it be ratios? also happy birthday!"
2/7/2017,"you get my vote, the csm would benefit from having you there as would we the players."
2/7/2017,"firstly, the csm is not a mechanics development group so it's not really up to them/me to say this is exactly how it should be however i will answer as best i can.i do believe that the longer a group has occupied their current space there should be some form of extra defensiveness provided, if you have spent 4 years in an area developing it and investing isk into it, then yes there should be more options to the defenders or at least some form of passive bonuses that accrue over time. the kind of advantages i believe would be realistic are more for mechanics related to possible invasions, such as citadels vulnerability timers being extended on citadels that do not belong to the sov owner. if it is linked the the strategic index, at the very least the buffer comes from time of sov ownership, alongside this perhaps there could be additional levels of strategic index that go towards these bonuses rather than adm for a system.with the proliferation of astrahus being dropped all over the game there is quickly becoming many safe havens for people within space they do not own. obviously attackers need a chance at getting a foothold but the defender should get a decent bonus to defending their own space. if it were to be some form of additional adm accrued over time then i feel a ratio system would probably be better, but that is something for the real devs to design. i simply want to push the idea that it needs to be more geared to a defender who has been there for a longer period.honestly, the greater numbers vs smaller numbers is always going to be down to balancing and even then, eve players have a habit of breaking that as soon as humanly possible. i believe in giving the defender an advantage, be they big or small, will help alleviate some of those issues. the obvious hurdle is to make ensure those bonuses scale well enough that they don't make it impossible for any alliance big or small to be removed.i hope this has helped. again i want to stress, i don't see csm as a game developer job. its about providing feedback and pointing out areas that we believe the playerbase desires changes in."
2/7/2017,jonatan reed is a good man. a vote for him is a vote for a greater lowsec.
2/7/2017,"keep the good work, you got my voice,i'm third party developper, i love your database conversion. if you can talk a few to improve api for pos management (or citadell management in future, if they replace moon mining pos)"
2/7/2017,"you have my accounts votes yet again (for whatever that's worth). i have some bones to pick however regarding group industry, engineering complexes and very much agree with you around mining changes. where did you suggestion box go? is it easier to pester you on the tweetfleet slack?"
2/7/2017,"sorry for that short delay in getting back to you:1) while mining crystals are a complex munition, they also have the simplest targets. you _know_ which crystal you should use on which asteroid. it's explicit in the names. which balances out nicely. it also gives a good reason for group play, with the more limited cargo bays of the miners being supplemented by the boosters larger general bay. mining crystals can also be swapped at will.the refining rigs, on the other hand, are far more limited. once installed, they can only be changed by destroying them. if they were split more, then you'd need to have a greater number of refineries. which isn't viable.2) you could expand the same question to mordus legion. i _suspect_ the real reason is to add 'terrain' to nullsec, so there are reasons to control certain systems. 3) i'm really not a fan of standings in their current form. gating content behind a grind isn't fun. and jump clones hadn't been a standing benefit for years. you either just joined a jump clone corp for a day, or you had someone grind out standing in a corp, and then share it with everyone else in corp (and bob protect anyone who accidentally got standing with the donor corp)however!:with the introduction of the mining npcs, we're beginning to see where high standings have a use. where they should. moderating npc behavior. sure, it's a limited number of corporations at the moment, but long term, i'd expect to see more."

2/8/2017,"the mobile scan inhibitors (msi) are a limited anti-gang deployable structure that removes the ability for an enemy combatant to d-scan anything within a 30km range of the the inhibitor, this includes the use of combat scan probes. however, it itself can be scanned down by combat probes.the problemwhile on paper this looks like it might be a viable tool because an enemy does not have the ability to know what might be lurking in that ""hole in space"", practical application of this as a surprise tactic is very limited and situational. as such, it is not commonly used for any purpose including its intended one. the price point seems to be about 30 to 35mil which is too high for a mere hour's functionality. second, since the scan inhibitor is able to be probed down by combat probes, you need to use at least two of them to have any reasonable chance of effectiveness.i propose one of the following solutions:1. dramatically reduce the build costs of the msi so that they cost approximately 5 to 10mil isk. this would allow even one man operations to put up at least two without impacting the user's overall profitability.2. increase the deployment duration from 1 hour to 4 hours. this would offset the high-cost of this unit and allow users to use them as a strategic asset.3. allow them to be picked up and redeployed a limited number of times, between 3-5 times. this limited deployment will justify useage as it will allow the user to move it to a more suitable location, in case they move to another mission pocket, another belt, or another gate."

2/8/2017,"this was the reason i actively seperated them, actually, i was able to draw things that both parties agreed on. specifically that perma-bumping was overall not a great mechanic, and that a timer for it would be (as much as the exact time would be debated) overall a positive gameplay experience change, even if they disagreed with the philosophy behind it. both sides also understood that there was an issue with information availability, with gankers feeling that if there were more of a general understanding of how it worked as an activity, people wouldn't be as heavily negative towards it. gankees and anti-gankers also felt that this information assymetry lead directly to a feeling of dissatisfaction that also was unfairly weighted towards newer players. one specific change brought by both sides that i felt was worth escalating to team genesis was a one time warning for newer players undocking with a large amount of worth in assets in a t1 industrial, as it's not immediately apparent that one can be killed in hisec. it would be simple to do, and help prevent a lot of 'bad feeling'. i gleaned a lot more from this, but these roundtables in general are a way of me representing the interests of people who i think aren't brought to the table effectively on the csm, especially when i see a possibility of said interests being addressed by ccp. see the pve townhall in the conclusion stages of the shadow of the serpent event for another example of ensuring that my own views are not unrepresentative of the playerbase before talking directly with ccp."

2/8/2017,"in a perfect world we wouldn't need downtime at all. obviously this would be the outcome i'd like to see the game move towards, and something ccp has expressed interest with in the past. it is arguably the most elegant solution to the ""get out of jail free"" nature of downtime mechanics. if you are talking about structure (more importantly, sov) timers that is a bit of a different issue. within the confines of the current mechanics i don't see an easy fix. but more importantly, it's not for the csm to find a fix. csm members point out the issue and then it's on ccp to either a) agree there is a problem and think about a fix or b) disagree and take no action. i've brought up the overall issue of timezone fragmentation with ccp though, so developers are aware, if that makes you feel better."

2/8/2017,"lillik e here, announcing my candidacy for csmxii!who:i've been playing eve online since 2010, have taken several breaks, then restarted in 2013 and have continuously played since. i was a member of eve university for almost a year; participating and helping in their various <U+FFFD>campuses<U+FFFD>. this is where i caught the w-space bug. after a few false starts, i settled permanently in w-space, living in both low and high-class holes.why:in my almost four years playing, i've noticed a perpetual stagnation of female players. whether this is caused by lack of interest, some stigma, or something more basic, is unknown to me. i do know this game is enjoyable on many levels, and could be enjoyed by anyone with the slightest of interest.i've also noticed that there is a definite lack of female players in w-space. whether by chance or by choice is also unknown. as a female gamer, i don't see any space as particularly <U+FFFD>better or worse<U+FFFD>, though i have my obvious bias. how:my goals are twofold:help bringing more female players to know, appreciate, and love all that is eve online.help bringing more new (and not so new) female players to know, appreciate, and love w-space.my goals will include outreach, and whatever tools ccp will allow. this will be determined at a later date.what's so great about this:bringing in more players, obviously. that they're female players would be a nice balance, too. honestly, i'm not here to re-invent the wheel, nor stand on some feminist soap box. this is my little way of taking a great game and making it greater!conclusion:do i have a chance of succeeding here. pretty slim. after all, this is a popularity contest, and i'm a relative unknown. but i'm trying anyway. eve online is worth it. new eden is worth it. you're all worth it. let's do this! update: it's official! lillik e is on the ballot. let's bring our female friends to the awesome world that is eve. w-space awaits them!"

2/8/2017,"some players have voiced concerns over the 40km scram range scripted hictors being oppressive to solo/small gang pvp. do you agree? how big of an issue is it? how would you fix it, if needed?"
2/8/2017,"seriously hyde? useless csm member? i think if you take a step back and consider that literally a third of csm x quit, boycotted csm, got removed, or were implicated in some kind of scandal, it's pretty insulting and petty to use me as an example of a useless csm. why don't you spend 10 minutes thinking about how useful all the ""vets"" of csm x were who literally were so bad they disappeared or got kicked before using me as an example of uselessness. some of them straight up went awol and left eve, but somehow i'm the bad guy. when citadels were going to have features that would ruin wormhole space i pushed (along with corbexx) for their removal. when literally nobody on csm understood how missile damage application worked i lobbied hard to try to bring missile guidance comps and the associated rigor catalyst nerfs to a reasonable point when the new probing system was being put into place i pushed back again and again and again to get every fix possible made that wormholers and explorers were asking for when the camera was completely screwed i sat with ccp and jayne for several hours to walk them through community feedback on solo, fleet, and videomaking issues don't even get me started on just straight up trying to be a positive productive member while dealing with pretty much the most toxic csm environment of all time that stupid bracket for your own ship was part of my ui qol agenda... did i mention that i actively and positively contributed to csm all friggin year? i don't believe in calling people out by name, but there were legitimately veteran players on csmx that didn't know how attributes affect skill point gain. meanwhile they ranted just as loud about how injectors should work. there were veterans that responded to maybe 10% of the feedback posts in confluence, even on issues they in theory knew about. when we had a branding/advertising exercise, one well-loved csm flat out refused to participate on some unimaginable grounds. but you know, i'm the problem, right?"

2/8/2017,"give all 4 midslot bs a 5th mid.right?right???memes are love, memes are life.also, let<U+FFFD>s not kid ourselves into thinking that the csm is some kind of a ""super tryhard serious organization"" i for one would welcome a candidate who could bring some fresh air.i see no reason for ""memes"" to stop someone from running for csm. do you seriously think he is going to spam memes and play vuvuzelas during the meetings? (not that it would be a bad thing).also, i dare say anyone who doubts rhiload<U+FFFD>s actualy ingame skill is talking out of their arse.i support rhiload in the csm wars"
2/8/2017,"ayy lmao chance thinking he matters anywhere other than his ******** corp and youtube subs. although i recently became a thera resident i don't think you represent my opinion nor the opinions of anyone else other than sc0ut(lol). as for rhiload, i think he still needs time to prove himself as a worthy csm candidate and show that he's capable of being mature and cut the memes. yeah i thought memes are cool once too."
2/8/2017,"isn't the commentating job mainly reserved for eve's 'notable' personalities and not always indicative of a pure understanding of the finer points of eve mechanics and balance? most of the videos are just trash memes and poorly overreaching slam attempts at americans. additionally, i find it easy to just bash the ship and its balance design for lacking a ""mid slot"" pg or maybe a bonus as you do in 90% of video we watch that isn't filled with the aforementioned ""trash memes"". any new bean in horde or test could figure out whats lacking in a ship pretty quickly but it takes a person worthy of being on the csm to note the potential draw backs to the complex web of ship balance by simply adding a mid slot to the punisher or buffing medium autos. unfortunately, i do not believe you have shown yourself capable (and as you admitted) of understanding the big and small picture of balance and mechanics. to add, you say you want to help lowsec and the little guy, yet have given very little to address the issues you would like to solve and that are at the core of your candidacy. quite frankly, in my eight+ years of playing this game, i haven't seen a candidate that i thought was more unqualified to be on the csm than you, and i was friends with darius iii.this is one candidate i will not be voting for this year."
2/8/2017,"we need fresh ideas, give the kid a chance."
2/8/2017,"so as someone who isn't part of one of the largest alliances out there i should want, what...goonswarm, or test or pl representing my interests?no thanks.i'd vote for rhiload just to get some fresh perspective and fresh air on the csm.rhiload for csm!"
2/8/2017,when are you running omega?would rather the plebs seek the true wisdom than divide themselves like this
2/8/2017,"why would you bash one of the few content creators this game has?it<U+FFFD>s not like someone forces you to watch those videos. if they aren<U+FFFD>t your cup of tea it<U+FFFD>s fine, but given the popularity he has gained apparently an overwhelming majority of the community likes them.and i see that as a good thing. not all eve videos need to be 100 percent tryhard."
2/8/2017,another youtuber dank fresh meme
2/8/2017,this isn't satire?
2/8/2017,well that might be the first problem you have right there.the csm is not solely or even primarily about game balance. that's merely one of the many facets it deals with (and less so recently as ccp has been using focus groups more). being an expert in the minutiae of ship mechanics is only one potential strength for a csm candidate. there are other valid strengths for a csm candidate and other issues the community cares about.
2/8/2017,"when you cite the videos as part of your platform and experience, it makes them fair game."
2/8/2017,your entire post is hollow and empty. instead of **** talking rhiload and wingspan why don't you talk substance? you're inciting a flamewar and providing nothing constructive.
2/8/2017,"please rhiload, balance meme in the game"
2/8/2017,"csm is suppose to stop ccp from putting out crappy game breaking features. pl salt aside, you don't need to be an expert on ship balancing to be on the csm. while admittedly rihloads not an expert, he's still someone who's lived in lowsec and has knowledge of the different regions. i'm pretty sure rihload knows what could be bad for lowsec, and what may be good for lowsec. he is truly a candidate with lowsec interest at heart."
2/8/2017,"haaa funny to see how hyde torpedoed his own reelection campaign with this thread. even funnier is his argumentation that rhiload wouldn't be able to provide serious feedback, i mean you have to actually attend meetings to give feedback wouldn't you agree? (csm attendance sheet)#teamjin'taan"
2/8/2017,you know suitonia is in cfc right? non-bloc??? what are you smoking hyde?
2/8/2017,uh look at the sov map fam cfc is kill
2/8/2017,does your sov map not have delve on it?
2/8/2017,jesus... we almost made it a year without drama from the csm.. theres a right and a wrong way to do things when representing the csm. i think we can all agree this is not the right way.
2/8/2017,"instead of blindly going for the ""memes 4 csm"" circlejerk please try to understand what hyde wrote before saying it's unsubstantiated."
2/8/2017,got my vote
2/8/2017,stereotyping much?
2/8/2017,"don't act like people would have voted for you without your videos. you're now not the only one with a youtube channel running for csm. wingspan was a ****** to want to give jfs an agro timer, but you were trying to get cargo buffs for battleships. you're irrelevant."
2/8/2017,>tfw people aren't just voting capri + suitonia + rhiload and instead are wholly focused on their personal favourites because what is stv?
2/8/2017,great. now i know who to cast my 4 votes for. chance and rhiledit: also xenuria
2/8/2017,i support the dawa on hyde. remove remove
2/8/2017,"lmao, the pl circlejerk is soooo salty!rhiload you have my vote cuz you are so good @ triggering this salty dudes!srry mr hyde, i tought you were a good dude (game-related, ofc), probably being so long in contact with pl's dudes made you salty bittervet.the recent usa prooved that we, the plebs, are tired of you cool dudes who are part of the establishment. we want dunk memes!"
2/8/2017,f*ck it. xenuria gets my #1 vote this year.
2/8/2017,will you push for jfs to get a weapons timer upon jumping to a cyno?
2/8/2017,"i read through his post multiple times and their is very little that could even vaguely be considered constructive or useful.a. he thinks suitonia is a better smallgang/solo pvper candidate without actually providing any evidence or arguments for itb. attacks his knowledge and experience of small gang/solo pvp because he doesn't like rhiload's content format. i.e he doesn't actually say why rhiload isn't experience or what even experience can be based upon. other than style the hyde's and rhiload's videos really aren't that different. he doesn't once describe what qualifies a player as experienced at game balance. c. attacks wingspan for being a useless csm member without actually describing what a useful csm member is. ""propel him above his station."" - hyde. says everything you need to know about hyde. he's an egotistical tryhard who should step off his high horse instead of talking **** about others."
2/8/2017,"mr. hyde i had some respect for your efforts as csm and your vids....but now after i read your post, i must say:this is some serious bullshit! your're affront people, you don't know...maybe ""chance"" a bit, but surely not rhiload. if you are rly care for the game, you should spend your time with supporting people, where do you think could fit as future csm.but complaining about ppl you dont even know. and trying to stop their efforts...is some subhuman ****. this sounds not like a guy who had some progess this year as csm, to make the game ""better"". this sounds like a bitter-vet and cryhard! poor mrs. hyde! o7btw. i know rhiload and believe, that he's able to do good stuff as csm."
2/8/2017,"ok, i was still making up my mind but this has definitely tipped it for me. voting for rhiload."
2/8/2017,and you expected thanks?you dumb choob.
2/8/2017,"so far only one action has been necessary here, and i'd like to keep our activities in here to an absolute minimum.disagreements, arguments and everything is fine and welcome, this is a forum after all. but please do so in a meaningful manner without making a mess of things. ~buldath"
2/8/2017,rhiload alive in serbija hyde we war you
2/8/2017,"i disagree with mr hyde.streaming and public exposure of pvp and tournaments is a growing aspect of eve online, one which i think needs more attention. so in that regard as well as having an informed opinion about small-gang balance, i think rhiload has a lot to offer as a csm member."
2/8/2017,"tbh you were more of a yoloswag csm poster boy than anything else. and you were carried by your youtube subs. saying that hyde was carried was and is ridiculous seeing has his sub count was by far lower than yours. did people vote for him because he made videos? probably. but i think most people voted for him because his videos showed he had a firm grasp on how eve mechanics worked. same reason why somebody would vote for big miker. also saying you were a positive member while posting this salty of a post kind of make that hard to believe. and also why not vote for suitonia and rhiload? your allowed multiple votes for that reason. suitonia seems to have a better understanding of the mechanics. rhiload seems to have a decent, more than me at least, understand of mechanics, have both would be a positive in my books.#deletetheweak"
2/8/2017,tl;dr. most unqualified member of the current csm accuses others of being unqualified. salt ensues. noobman and rhiload for csm
2/8/2017,what...? when hyde is posting crap that has no evidence or serious arguments in it that slanders chance then i think chance has every right to defend himself. i'd be livid if hyde posted that load of garbage about me without actually providing some form of substantiated argument.
2/8/2017,"i don't get the ""vote for suitonia, because only 10 ppl can get in"" argument.i can just vote for suitonia and rhiload.that's rather silly of mr hyde."
2/8/2017,"believe it or not all suitonia does/has been doing lately is solo and before he joined goons a lot of small gangs in querios. he also has no life so i'm at least sure he's competent.not even close. he criticises him because he hasn't shown seriousness once. it's all memes and memes. that's like saying wingspan's ""pvp"" vids are the same as chessur's :thinking: i haven't been around for csm x to know but to be honest we don't need an argument to prove that chance has no place on the csm. i am actually not advocating hyde because of his occasional arrogance(and to keep the narrative going tbh) nor rhiload because of childish behaviour. what i'm trying to say is that hyde actually has a point and memes on csm should never be a thing.oh yeah and rhiload puts in 'voice for content creators' in his campaign. how does this make sense?"
2/8/2017,i just came here to say that you are all gay pwnedalso wingspan ur **** lmao
2/8/2017,"well this has turned entertaining.first lol is hyde attacking people because of game balance, seriously hyde, ccp can't balance **** and it's their game!second lol hyde thinking csm is relevant in anyway shape or form.third lol all the salt from pl defending hyde being a ****trololololololo"
2/8/2017,"hr.hyde you have let me down, you really just posted all that and provide no evidence. its all subjective and how would you know who is going to be a good csm member? this post certainly is making me lean to rhiload and make me look at his platform more seriously. lastly, csm seat for non-bloc members? coming from the mr.hyde with the pandemic legion module? maybe you say that seriously but i'm not sure if i can looking at your affiliations (or past affiliations)."
2/8/2017,actually hyde has been afk and has literally nothing to do with pl other than use the ticker to trigger people.
2/8/2017,tbh i'm just gonna vote for capri and hope for the best.
2/8/2017,"that doesn't change the fact that hyde didn't provide an argument for why suitonia is better. rhiload has done a lot of small gang and solo **** as well but somehow he isn't experienced at it? what do you mean not even close? first of all. seriousness does not mean experience. just because mr. hyde has a stick up his ass doesn't mean he's experienced. hyde hasn't described what he means by experience and says that rhiload's videos aren't a measure of his experience because they aren't serious. even if they aren't a measure of experience doesn't mean that rhiload doesn't have it. rhiload wasn't all memes at the at so he has shown that he can give serious input. if you think his input his bad then you should provide arguments for it which hyde didn't do.it really isn't. i didn't say that all pvp videos are the same but i think this point is mostly off topic. lol what? you absolutely need an argument to prove that chance has no place on the csm. he has provided a bunch of good arguments for why he was actually useful and saying he's a bad csm member because you don't like him, his content or his corp says a lot more about you than it does him.rhiloads childish behaviour? if you want to say his behaviour has been childish then point out examples because meme videos aren't exactly mature and serious but they don't mean he's exhibiting childish behaviour. even if he was childish at some point doesn't mean he can't be a good csm member.believe it or not but rhiload has experience with content creating (who would have thought?) so i don't see how you think that doesn't make sense. i think rhiload could provide a more clear platform for what he thinks is unbalanced/balanced and offer up some solutions so we can actually judge for ourselves if he would be good at providing criticism to ccp's planned balance and gameplay changes. as for dedication, i think he's shown that he's very passionate about eve so i don't believe he'll have a childish break and delete all of his content and disappear for two weeks without a warning unlike some csm member."
2/8/2017,"still pretty hard to accept those words considering (allegedly) past affiliation. clearly has some use for the ticker, i don't care who he is affiliated with, but its very clear they are affiliated with one of the big blocs even in just name. like i said. maybe they are serious about it, but with mere affiliation it can change things or at least my opinion."
2/8/2017,do you have anything else to say other than 'prove the obvious' lmao.
2/8/2017,chance has been running his mouth against hyde since the start of hyde's csm career. seen here i'm pretty sure they both have had a feud going on for a while now. chance was the one who ran his mouth bringing it into the csm. so if you want to point fingers on who started it first. there's your blame.#deletetheweak
2/8/2017,bit rich of hyde to be criticizing others when he can't even be bothered to attend meetings. he has only attended 10 of the 42 meetings (39 if you include holidays) according to:
2/8/2017,mfw when you call out rhiload for being childish and then reply with this.are you referring to chance's clearly sarcastic comment about electing a youtuber?
2/8/2017,"i find that hyde's criticism of someone being useless is patently laughable seeing as his attendance (or lack thereof) in the csm was as abysmal as g dubya's during his time in office. hell, even xenuria had better attendance than you. i'd rather have someone that is actually there listening rather than having an impotent empty seat.look, i generally like your videos, hyde, but it's a bit of a stretch to say you have a better understanding of mechanics and balancing when your streams are almost always using the blingyiest of fits. that's like someone commenting on the performance of a honda civic whom drives a ferrari 70% of the time. also, sure chance isn't the best of players (he never proclaimed to be as such) and he had a bad idea (jf aggro), i do appreciate the issues and solutions that he brought forth. if anything, i think there needs to be fewer bloc players that are there to represent the interests of the entirety of eve rather than being beholden to the special interests of their bloc.thanks for solidifying my vote for rhiload. he should hire you as his campaign manager for how many votes you managed to flip to his side by this tantrum of a post."
2/8/2017,"so many idiots that don't understand just how important content creators are for eve online. every csm should have at least one on the team. there is no need for 100 bitter vets that don't know how the game works (much less programming), but think they are cool because they have a lot of sp.people with many many years of playing eve have done **** in the csm, there is no reason to shun someone who has 4-5 years. hell, i know players who started in the last 12 months that know the game better than many bigshot vets."
2/8/2017,do you actually expect me to waste my time proving that memes aren't serious? i'm sad i can't directly call people r*etards on this forum.
2/8/2017,"i never said that memes are serious, and your replies aren't getting anyless childish."
2/8/2017,the solo/small gang crowd are obnoxious. the appeal of that gameplay was that it was hard and took skill since the game was not balanced with hat in mind.pushing the game down a path of solo/small gang balance will only appeal to a vast minority.
2/8/2017,"completely agree, though the same can be said about most playstyles individually.pushing any path doesn't really help unless it's inclusive of all playstyles. eve needs more players, logging in more often, performing a blend of gameplay types that they all enjoy and that interact with each other, whether voluntarily or not.it's a big universe, let's fill it.30,000 logged in with 90% docked doesn't help eve one bit."
2/8/2017,in this quote are the 2 reasons why i would never run for csm. i really cba any longer to respond to stupid people.
2/8/2017,"+1my alliance lives 2 jumps away from rhiload's hangout in low sec. often see him out solo roaming the area, he is always a good sport and actually talks to you in local after a fight or in between.i think your videos, are hilarious and you should keep do"
2/8/2017,"wow. i had a lot of respect for hyde. even voted for him. i don't really like sutonia or rhiload as candidates (rhiloads vids are f*cking hilarious all the same), but trying to sway others to not vote for somebody else is just sad. especially from someone currently in the csm. leaves a bad taste in my mouth.if i still played eve (other than just skilling) i'd be well pissed off."
2/8/2017,rhiload gets my vote just because of this.
2/8/2017,"outside of all the comments around mrhyde etc.rhiload, your statement is weak man, there is no depth or substance that even interests a vote. your statement that working with sui would be good worries me because with weak views and a strong experience that sui has means 2 csm seats will be taken up when 1 seat would be adequate.i think you should really focus on what you are going to bring and how its going to affect the player base - be specific about an area of specialism because sorry man, youtube and commentator credentials =/= capability"
2/8/2017,can we vote for both of them so they have to spend time together?
2/8/2017,"it takes practice, lots and lots of practice.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
2/8/2017,"i'm pretty s*** at the game, won't lie, but i feel that rhiload knows what he's doing.i think that following the rule that ""all good jokes contain truth in them"", he probably knows whats up with major balancing issues as such. i personally don't have much experience in pvp since i'm awful at the game, but it seems that there are some recurring themes that i hear in his videos that resonate in the eve subreddit, like ""svipuls are cancer"" or ""balanced legion"" or whatever. i also see his cynical approach to ship balancing as perhaps a correct one, given that he doesn't filter what he says in any obvious way (again, i'm bad, i can't reference his statements to my own experience)sure, he might not appear to be 100% serious or extremely knowledgable, but i am sure of one thing - this guy spends a lot of time doing pvp and has enough sense of humor to hopefully not get caught up in his own *******.for that, he's got my vote."
2/8/2017,i'm capsuleer hyperflare and this is my favourite dramathread on this forum.
2/8/2017,not empty quoting
2/8/2017,lol mr hyde hardly even showed up and he's calling out members who did.i reckon we should strip old members if their title if they have less than 50% attendance rate.useless prick
2/8/2017,"while rhiload may not be an expert on game mechanics, to argue that because his videos are of a comedic nature he knows nothing about the game (and to compare him to chance ravine no less) is low, and simply not true. he's not only demonstrated a reasonable ability to deride the strengths of weaknesses of ships and their fits, but also a willingness to learn and improve his understanding of the game (which is more that most of the csm can say). on top of that he's proven himself to be an extremely capable small gang and solo pilot. we don't need more experts in game mechanics and major players is massive alliances, we need more of the little guys; solo players, small gang pvpers, industrialists, high sec pilots, and people that aren't from one of the game's three major coalitions. for that reason he's got my vote!"
2/8/2017,"edit: message to hydei dont know about all that **** you just said, but i do know this:you are a baby back ***** that whines and cries whenever you lose a fight, and completely lose your **** when you get pwnd. chesseur too.rhiload does not. in fact, the grace and/or good humor he shows in local when he loses makes him a vote in my book, and even tho i have never voted for a csm yet, i will vote against you specifically now.have a nice day."
2/8/2017,"hyde isn't running for csm xii, which is good since he did frag all besides trying to get larger cargo space for bs. because, you know, he hates not being able to hold enough cap boosters to fight frigates in his vargur for less than 30 mins at a time and there isn't anything else of note in this game that should be fixed or improved."
2/8/2017,"it's interesting to see that what appears to be a legitimate complaint, albeit without much substance, is dismissed as ""salt"" and being part of eve's meta game. no wonder it took eight(?) years to fix links and the community is ""split"" on the ecm issue."
2/8/2017,"i have no problem with someone like suitonia effectively explaining deficiencies in ship balancing, on a csm that also might include rhiload, explaining what features need improving to help eve reach the broadest possible audience. or the both of them arguing in front of ccp about how to make battleships great again. the ultimate arbitrator in all such discussions is ccp, who pick and choose from what the csm is saying, to inform their opinion of how the broader player base will react to this or that game change or new feature ccp is considering. some of the subtext that candidates need to accurately understand and explain game balance implies that ccp doesn't; and shifts in the meta or economy... and the time game designers are allowed to spend on a given feature in the midst of other priorities at ccp, also help lead to balance problems."
2/8/2017,"i didn't even know who rhiload is, and i certainly dislike youtubers (too old for that ****) but after mr hyde's comments and pl brigading and shitting i'm definitely going to support him."
2/8/2017,"with this thread i submit to you the player base my intent to run for csm 12.this would be my 3rd run for csm. i was a member of csm 8 and csm 10. i would like to say i had complete success on both my terms on csm but i will begrudgingly admit that i also had faults and failures. i would say this year is my chance to show that i am still good at what i know and still have the ability to share it with people on the csm and ccp and especially with you the players. i do not believe i deserve it just because i have been a csm before and run a coalition. i believe i should be elected for what i can bring to the table.in game i run a moderately sized coalition called guardians of the galaxy, gotg for short. we have also been referenced in the past as dumpster co (which i personally prefer but that is just me.) i am ceo of darkness alliance a former member of stain wagon and n3 coalition. i am famous for speaking my mind and not always being totally diplomatic, i am also famous or infamous for being a backstabber. i gave up not long ago trying to defend this because i came to the realisation that if that is how people see me then they are welcome to their opinions. i can be abrasive but to people in my coalition i am known to be open to talking to if and when needed. on discord i run a server called the blue donut. in this server is content creators and fc<U+FFFD>s and some leaders from all round the game i have spent a lot of the time in there to help connect both current csmers and past csmers with a voice direct to leaders and fcs in this game. during csm 10 i submitted 10s of pages of information direct from these people straight to ccp i would intend to do this again should i be reelected. should i not be elected i will still aim to provide this same source of information and communication with whomever the player base elects.what i stand for and what i believe in:i am a strong advocate for 0.0 but during my time i have tried nearly everything there is in eve online. mostly to success and some to horrible failures. i am a fierce advocate of new players entering the game and our closest ally is pandemic horde the biggest new player alliance in the game. a lot of people have asked why gotg or darkness does not run an alpha or newbro program and the answer is in 2 parts. 1) because we would be **** at it. 2) because we would prefer to send people to an ally and or someone who knows what they are doing than risk hurting them and running them from the game.my platform.after 3 years i am going to say the same thing i did on the last forum thread like this. i run on a platform of listening. i want to work with ccp to point out possible conflict points but also to provide answers and help towards bettering the game as a whole. i do not run to better myself. i have been at the top and bottom of this game i am using this time to give back to the player base.me as a person:in my personal life i am married to a beautiful wife and have recently become a father to a beautiful baby boy. i have frequented multiple player meets and gotten to know hundreds of players and families of players. i may be considered by some to be an ******* in eve but when you get to know me it's known i don<U+FFFD>t actually bite. i am more of a hugger.this year is going to be a hard fought election i hope you consider me for the post. thank you for reading."

2/8/2017,"i debated on making this post, as i'm not sure if it was worth my time. but anyways, here goes.i wanted to clear up a couple of points you bring up, and hand wave because they're telling about you as a leader, and have weight on whether or not you'd be an effective csm. this may come off as a personal attack, and i'll try to steer clear of that, i think however it's important for people to hear from the other side, as someone who's watched you closely in your various leadership positions you've had over the years.first you bring up being a backstabber, or being known as one. i don't believe this to be true. what is true is that you're erratic. there is little consistency in your behavior and it takes very little for someone go to from friend to enemy. people see this as being a backstabber, but i think the actual issue is that you have no internal consistency in your actions, and simply react to whatever situation is in front of you without much forethought.you bring up being abrasive. this is true, but this is also true of almost everyone. the issue is however that you don't apologize for your abrasiveness when given the opportunity to do so when you're in the wrong. running independent communication streams. you have what at this point, a dozen, maybe more channels that you're part of between skype, discord and others. this doesn't help your erratic nature, and as a coalition leader you've become increasingly isolated. these places are fine to have, but segregating yourself in them and them being echo chambers speaks poorly for your leadership capabilities. rl you is a nice enough guy though the couple times we've met, and best wishes to you and the family."

2/8/2017,"interesting ideas and proposals, but i have a few honest questions.what constituency, really, are you representing? what kinds of players are you looking to speak on behalf of, and how do you intend to gather feedback from them to go on to present to ccp? i feel like you're trying to appeal to a broad base of players and putting up your ideas and credentials without actually telling us how you intend to act as a representative.are you aware that the csm is not entirely an 'ideas machine' with csm people able to get an agenda filled? are you prepared to accept that it's going to be a lot of 'this is our idea, what do you think' and having to build working relationships with specific devs and teams? you could table all of these ideas and proposals on day 1, what are you aiming to do with the rest of the year?i like your way of thinking and your ideas for the game, but having spoken a lot to some former and current csm members about what the job actually entails, i fear you might not be doing the 'job' (vague as a csm's role can be these days) justice and how you'll respond to the needs of those who vote for you. if you were running for a dev job, yeah i'd swing you a vote, but you're running for basically a consultancy job.i want to know how you actually intend to canvass feedback from us on specific areas of the game over the course of an entire year.""face the enemy as a solid wall for faith is your armor and through it, the enemy will find no breach wrap your arms around the enemy for faith is your fire and with it, burn away his evil"""

2/8/2017,"representation is a hard thing to improve. i mean, i try to represent the people who contact me, and i try to keep up to date with the issues people talk about, in places i see it (the forums, reddit, slack, twitter and so on) but if you're meaning people who don't contact me, that's not something i can really do?communication, other than through the aforementioned places, well, again, it's hard to improve? i could write more blog posts, but other than that, there's not a lot i can do? i like to think i'm easily approachable, and i do take things to ccp as i see them. in general, this year has been a lot better than 10 was. part of that has been having two coordinators, rather than just one, and ccp moving more communications to hipchat has helped a lot. 10 got hit by the migration phase, and communication suffered because of that.as for things which went wrong, there was very little with the process itself. there's some changes i'd have liked to have seen earlier in the process, so more shaping input could have been given, but we're talking perfect world there."

2/8/2017,"1) figuring out what the best form of mass advertising is for the current perspective new gamer base. retaining is a mixed bag of continuing to improve the npe for getting started, and making sure they are aware of the tools to find player run organizations. 2) providing payouts early on that allow such activities. currently due to the imbalance of faucets and sinks early access to income is horribly handicapped for starting players short of finding someone else to help boost them up. 3) i don't necessarily think that everyone should be forced into null/low/wh as there are people (who i've met) who literally just aren't comparable with these forms of gameplay short of extreme handholding. it might be worth exploring how to convey the possibilities of this space more to newer players. 4) giving them something different than the every day grind. right now the pve is repetitive as **** and is purely done for isk making purposes. there will always be some people who literally want nothing more than to plex up for a big fight and then do nothing. but there are people who want to log in and just have different things to do than the same thing they've been doing for the better part of a decade."

2/8/2017,"hello space capsuleers.my name is jtclone ares, i am the ceo of strangers of the cosmos. i have been playing eve for a little over 3 years. i have had my fair share of risk vs reward. most people know me to be a bit on the side of short and sweet. i get to the point, then the details later. i spent 2 years in hs and now most of my time in 0.0 industry, mining, and bit of pvp on the side.the reason why i am running for csm 12 is i decided to see if i can make some stuff happen between the community as well as the developer's(ccp). i do have plans to put ideas across the table as well as fixes to the game(ie. bugs). i do want to help create content for player's who play eve.the things i would put forth are:- skins - custom alliance logo or full ship skins - custom at skins - citadel skins for those who just wanna show off - skins for the t3- outpost's to become destructible- citadel deterioration over a long period of time- easier way to make bug fixing easy for ccp to find and fix- new addition of t2 battlecruiser - name them assault or siege bc - naga, tornado, oracle, talos- t2 battleships - rokh, abaddon, maelstrom, hyperion - new usage for using subcaps to help put more dps against sub caps as well as capitalships- mining platform array's - ideas' for having moon control to planet control to a system wide control of moon goo.- installation of player owned stargate and how they should work - sov re-work on jump bridge's- possible introduction to a capsuleer faction ship tree ranging from frigates up to capital ships - overpowered but hard to find and get, or usage through npc missions available in citadel's.- help increase the idea's of npc missions or corp missions for lp that is available through citadel access. - having lvl 5 missions available in 0.0, faction(navy, pirate or corp)- fix ships that aren't being used much often anymore. - re-balance of the dreads - ships that are least used(bring the least used ships up to the main bigger ships) revamp them back up.- new support capital ships which main usage is ewar - high ewar strength, barely any dps, and heavy usage for support fighterssome of these ideas have been brought up before hand but i do want to help increase the stability as well as increase the player flow into eve. i do like to tackle the big issues as well as listen to both the smaller guy as well as the bigger guy. look for the problems and see how many solutions can come up with in order to fix some of the basic or complex issues when they arise. i do want to bring these ideas up and get ccp going on increasing player ship diversity as well as increasing the boundaries for the players. these are just some of the ideas i have at this time.contact info:eve mailtwitter: @jtclone"

2/8/2017,"hello capsuleers of new eden!i am djavin novienta, member of eve university, and i would like to announce my candidacy for csm xii.myselfi first began my career as a capsuleer in 2011 and quickly found a home in a small highsec corporation. eve was my first foray into online gaming, and it has always occupied a special place in my heart. after piloting for about two years, i took a long break from my piloting career.i came back to eve september 2016 and immediately joined eve university. the game had changed a lot in the time i<U+FFFD>d been gone, and i felt a little lost and in need of some help. i<U+FFFD>ve since gotten back on track and now spend the majority of my time helping other unistas begin successful careers in new eden.if you look up my character info in-game, you<U+FFFD>ll see that i carry the vanity title of <U+FFFD>cariest of bears<U+FFFD>. i received this title at my own request and it is one that i wear with pride. i<U+FFFD>m not a competitive person and i don<U+FFFD>t particularly enjoy pvp. when i<U+FFFD>m in space you can find me either mining, missioning, running incursions, or exploring. however, most of my time is spent on various support roles within eve university: teacher, reimbursement officer, orientation officer, and wiki curator. i have taken on these many administrative tasks for two reasons: first, to contribute the community in a way that does not involve combat, and second, because i honestly love it! i<U+FFFD>ve found that in eve, administration is my gameplay, and i truly enjoy teaching classes, editing the uniwiki, and helping manage our ship replacement program.my goalscontinued expansion and refinement of the new player experience and other tutorial contentwith the release of ascension, it has become even more important to ensure that eve is accessible to new players. as an orientation officer at eve university, i<U+FFFD>ve seen firsthand the positive impact that the inception npe has had on new players, but i think there is a significant amount of room to improve even further.a few things things that can be done:establish a list of essential knowledge for new players. this list should answer the question: <U+FFFD>what should all players in eve know, or know how to do, and where can they go with it?<U+FFFD> any future tutorial content should be centered around imparting knowledge from this list.make more information readily available in-game. with the removal of the in-game browser, most information about eve is no longer accessible in-game, and requires opening a separate browser window. additionally, now that player-run sites (such as the uniwiki or the fuzzwork suite of tools) have become the primary source of information about the game, there is greater cause for concern that information found on such sites may not be accurate or up-to-date. for example, i can say from experience that the wiki curators are still scrambling to scrub all mentions of warfare links and off-grid boosting from the uniwiki even three months post-ascension. there is very little means of verifying information on external sites other than going into the game and verifying it for yourself. some ideas/options that can be implemented:- additional/expanded tooltips- <U+FFFD>active help<U+FFFD> popups, perhaps similar to those utilized by games such as final fantasy xiv. these could appear upon first exposure to different game mechanics such as agents, low- or nullsec, incursions, etc.- distinction between base ship & module stats and bonuses or effects from skillsa renewed focus on pve content, both reworking existing content and adding new content.npc mining operations were a welcome addition to the vast array of pve content that eve has to offer. unfortunately, the majority of the pve content in-game has existed in its current state since its original implementation. there are many ways that this area of eve<U+FFFD>s available activities can be improved, but here are a few specific ideas:- implement opportunities for solo player participation in incursions. options include reducing the strength of incursion rats to make them challenging but soloable with proper preparation (perhaps weakest in scout systems, strongest in headquarters), and implementing solo combat sites as cosmic anomalies and/or signatures.- increase the drop rate of faction tags and make data center missions repeatable, and/or allow players to turn in tags to any corporation for a standing increase (particularly useful for trader characters with plenty of isk but few combat skills).- rework cosmos missions and increase the stats of storyline modules to match the difficulty and cost of producing them.- add security missions with diverse win conditions. currently, security missions are based entirely around combat, and the only thing needed to complete them is a sufficient tank and passable dps. different win conditions, such as providing reps for a besieged freighter, or tackling a battleship so npc allies can destroy it, could encourage mission runners to maintain a number of different ships and reward them for training a diverse skillset."
2/8/2017,"reinforce the idea of new eden as a living world, and smoothly integrate eve lore into everyday gameplay.while the lore of eve is substantial and generally available to anyone interested in it, most of that lore is completely separate from gameplay. in some egregious cases, that lore is even directly contradicted in gameplay (see: any reference to a <U+FFFD>console<U+FFFD> while piloting a ship). on the large scale, more frequent in-game events in the vein of crimson harvest and purity of the throne can be used to signal changes in new eden. on the small scale, the <U+FFFD>little touches<U+FFFD> can subtly reinforce the idea amongst players that new eden is a living and dynamic universe. some ideas to be implemented:- npc <U+FFFD>bestiary<U+FFFD>: having a little more information about who you<U+FFFD>re fighting can be both interesting and provide a method of teaching new players about enemy resistances and weapons. allow enemies to be more than just enemy pilot #728 (unless you<U+FFFD>re fighting sansha<U+FFFD>s nation, that is).- unlockable journal entries for expeditions and complexes. epic arcs already have a whole journal section devoted to recounting their lore. expeditions already tell a story; adding that story to the journal would give them more impact (and make players want to run them again to follow them to completion!)contact meeve-mail or private convo/u/musicmage4114 on redditdjavin.novienta@gmail.com@musicmage4114 on twittereve university mumble (our <U+FFFD>private<U+FFFD> server has a public lounge linked to our student lounge - i<U+FFFD>d love to talk to you!)eve university forumsmy user talk page on the uniwiki"

2/8/2017,"lore really needs to play a more active role in the game. it needs to be reflected on more in the mechanics, and npcs need to be more than simple ratting victims, both in high sec and null. a lot of people seem to dismiss lore's importance in eve, but i feel like immersion is a vital part of making this game... fun. not only that but it's a lot easier for newer players to get into.you'll probably get a vote from me simply because no one else is really pushing for these things as much. instead of vague discussions of balancing game mechanics, i think simple touches like these are what eve really needs right now to become more appealing to a new player base, which let's be honest, we need more of."

2/8/2017,"just a small note, which really should be made on all csm candidacies such as this:the csm can propose stuff, yes. the chance of getting ccp to work on something you proposed, unless it's trivial, is close to zero. they have limited development resources (like anywhere) and thus prioritize. if they're working in an area anyway, that's when you can help shape it. but getting something looked at, which isn't already on the roadmap, is few and far between."

2/9/2017,"hi everyone, i'm white 0rchid and i'm happy to announce i will be running for csm.who am i?i've played eve on and off since 2008. in the latest 'on' period, i've been subbed for just over 2 years.a brief timeline and run down of my experiences in eve: 2008: omen incorporated (part of brutally clever alliance) - living in sovnull pre aegis (fountain). these guys helped me get off my feet when i first started and without them i'd most likely have quit soon after subbing. 2009 - 2013: subbed on and off, mostly running missions/ded sites. 2015: eve university - incursions, low class (c1-c3) pvp, c5 wr cap escalations, station trading, small to medium gang low/null pvp. they do a fantastic job at helping new/returning players. i am still a mentor there for players who show interest in pvp. i spent a while on the recruiting team. i also spent some time with bomber's bar and now run some of their out of game services. 2016/2017: waffles. solo/small gang to large fleet pvp. logistics/jfs. we are a nomadic group who deploy where the content is. i've recently been appointed a director. most of my time spent playing eve is focused on pvp. in any one week the situations i find myself in can range from solo t1 destroyer roaming to 200+ fleet fights with caps on field (you can check this on my zkill, i am a regular player and not afk by any means).i've also written various third party webapps that make use of ccp's apis (i'm a consultant/software developer in the real world and enjoy a problem).why run for csm?feedback between players and devs is critical to the game's successful evolution. i believe i am the type of person who would do well in such a role.while i don't think having a single agenda is ideal, one aspect i'd like to tackle is lowsec, more so i feel it should have reward equal to its risk. at the time of preparing this, each of the top 10 most active (pvp) lowsec systems (24hr) have either higher or equal pvp activity to their nullsec counterpart. taking into consideration there are 4 times as many null systems as there are low, that's a lot of activity packed into a small area of space, which makes it dangerous. the rewards for living there however, are not particularly fantastic.there are several other issues that i believe also need attention from ccp, if they are not already looking at them. session change timers & jump clone irks, certain aspects of citadels (courier contracts, broken tethers, set and forget mentality - space is getting crowded), customer support for hacked accounts, to name a few.due to my varied history and diverse experience in game, i feel i would be able to contribute to almost any discussions that arise and need input.tldr; i want to get things done because i love this game and the people in it, i'm not in it for the space fame.if you want to chat, feel free to hit me up tweetfleet slack (@white0rchid)in game (white 0rchid) - it's a zero not a letter :)twitter (@white0rchideve)thanks0rchid o7"

2/9/2017,"we are happy to announce that white 0rchid is sniggwaffe [waffles] official csm xii candidate. he is smart, open-minded and ready to listen to anyone who has a good idea. his experience as a hr officer and later director in sniggwaffe, one of the most active corps in game will surely help him in his gods work as csm representing the voice of the lowsec people who seems to be forgotten by ccp.a vote for white 0rchid is a vote for making low sec great again!"
2/9/2017,what are your attentions with my daughter (eve)
2/9/2017,"super excited you chose to run white!since i joined waffles a couple months, white has been a constant aid and source of knowledge when it comes to lowsec. he is always easy to reach and happy to answer any questions. #mlsga"
2/9/2017,"lel.check your station.edit: he's actually a chill, reasonable guy. he's a dirty ewwuro, but he's a good man. what i actually enjoy are candidates that are capable and willing to learn more about eve. when you recognize that you don't know everything, you spend less time chest beating and more time learning from others and how to effectively solve problems or present new ideas. coupled with the fact that he actually has solid knowledge and experience in eve, i think he'd do a solid job to mega."
2/9/2017,i am happy white 0rchid is running for csm. he is a good man with enormous knowledge about lowsec and game in general. i know he is going to do proper job in csm.
2/9/2017,"two lowsec candidates, one pirate and one from faction warfare? is this real life? white 0rchid, what are some ways you think you can connect the non-faction warfare lowsec players (pvpers and pvers) with ccp? what do you feel the major obstacles are towards (again, not faction warfare) lowsec and what is, memes aside, the best way to ""make lowsec great again""? meaning, what has been overlooked by ccp that you feel needs another look or at least brought to ccp's attention?"
2/9/2017,"if you want an idea, you can peruse my thread."
2/9/2017,+1 for white!#mlsga
2/9/2017,you go white! we are with you mate.
2/9/2017,good man +1
2/9/2017,what do you like on top of your pancakes?
2/9/2017,"i think it's an issue and it's really hurt solo/small gang roaming in nullsec. it's killed a lot of affordable kiting cruisers and pigeon holed a lot of people into going 100mn ab or bust. my preferred solution would be to introduce a new script for hics that has 40% of the current range, and attach the scramming effect to that script. focused warp disruption script - infipoint, stops capitals from jumping, same range as current.focused warp scrambler script - infipoint, scram effect + above. this would be a 15km scram on t2 and a 15.75km scram for ts/concord hic scrams. for reference this is better than heated true sansha scram on any non-bonused hull. i also think that the value of a highslot scrambler has been completely ignored with the balance of the scram effect on hics. it essentially was an extra midslot on a lot of hics that were running a scrambler anyway. i think this is good enough for a hic to do mjfg defence without making it as cancerous for gatecamping or anti-kiting as it is now.contributer to eve is easy:"
2/9/2017,"do you have any plans/idea's on the navy caracle, naga, and rohk? personally curious on those. all three of them seem to be overshadowed by similar counter parts and don't have a role to fill.#deletetheweak"
2/9/2017,"a vote for suitonia is a vote for eve!aside thatthis is the man for csm xii, a top tier choice indeed if i've ever seen one."
2/9/2017,"you already have my vote based on the amount knowledge you have shown in your videos.i am curious, however, on your thoughts related to the lack of ns wormholes after the change a couple of years ago. i am hoping more candidates will push to increase content holes (wh groups like to do small gang ns roams as well)."
2/9/2017,i am sorry but isnt your fame mostly from vids man?

2/9/2017,i very clearly recall chance's strong involvement on both these points.
2/9/2017,i've lost all respect for hyde as a result of his posts in this thread. sad to see that happen as one of my favourite youtubers.but you went full kanye man. never go full kanye.
2/9/2017,probably the best way of putting it.
2/9/2017,"disregarding drama, rhiload, how do you plan on pushing for better lowsec changes? you said you are running as a lowsec csm, but apart from that you haven't said much else. what concrete suggestions can you offer? what do you feel needs to change for lowsec to become more populated outside of the fw systems? you also said you are a csm for content creators, that word phrase gets used a lot, are you refering to just video creation? how do you plan on making that better for the community? or did you mean content creation in general?#deletetheweak"

2/9/2017,"as an equally useless youtuber for the spaceship massively multiplayer online role playing game eve online, i feel compelled to chime in with a hot take:just because you bumble around with a face cam (optional), a microphone, video editing software, and use the ever so complicated ""upload file"" function on youtube, you're not necessarily the most ideal person to have on a 10 person council that talks about game balance, design, and the other assorted topics ccp throw at the csm. you tend to need more going for you than that. and yet you somehow couldn't convince ccp that keepstars in wh space was a hilariously dumb idea.:thinking:"
2/9/2017,"whoever you are ""mrhyde"", go back to your abyss delusional demon."
2/9/2017,rhiload gets my vote for provoking this very entertaining fall from grace.

2/9/2017,"rhiload, can you tell us what is happening in your side of lowsec/nullsec (maybe even hisec)? any glaring stuff that needs attention? can you site a common grievance of lowsec/nullsec residents that you wanna tackle?whats your stand/ideas on npsi fleets?@hyde csm attendancei've read a post down at r/eve claiming that he still goes to school and the meeting times just doesn't agree with rl. again, that's the claim... which doesn't negate the fact of his attendance."
2/9/2017,"go back to your twitter page and quit that ""m"" thing."
2/9/2017,"hello all, now that the nuclear fallout has cleared, i will be addressing people's concerns and questions in a video, hopefully to be released within the next 2 weeks, hope to see you all there :)"
2/9/2017,"why do you feel lowsec needs a change?it's got the best pve (top kek wow 6/10s and faction warfare, level 5) it's got all the top tier pvp all the way from solo 1v1 frigates to 20vs.80 fights where the 80 is 15 logi and 65 sleipnirs :3most of it is populated.whereas nullsec's barer than a desert in the middle of dry monsoon season.convince me :)"
2/9/2017,"""the gravest of mistakes are made with a serious face"".i don't get your issue here tbh. it's very easy to see past rhiload's jests for an actual message he conveys. you may criticise, say, the depth of his understanding of the issues he talks about, but you choose not to. for the record, i'm nobody to make such claims, but this thread has a number of examples of attacking his actual points properly, and you did not contribute to that number.we're giving an evaluation here. obviousness is not something you can appeal to in this case.more on topic: i'm not someone who believes that ""csm candidacy platform"" is a primary thing, and i don't think that csm member's own ideas on changes really matter. however, it would help if op told us a bit more on the matter of his plans for csm in detail. as i understand it, ccp tend to discuss a variety of topics with csm and apparently an external media can very well become a topic of conversation.to me it's a bit difficult to see what ccp options on that front are, what would you support or advise against. what would you discuss with community members when it comes to this topic, what sorts of opinions are to be collected?"
2/9/2017,just about everyone i talked to in my little group last night was unaware of who rhiload was before hyde did this.someone do me a favor and please pass this along to mr. hyde...
2/9/2017,"tfw muricans take more seriously the election for cms than their president's election lmao. let's dig in in the matter: option 1 - mr hyde found rhiload with his mom last night and got mad ~~option 2 - rhiload raped him in a 1vs1 in battleships and didn't write gf in localoption 3 - it's all a cospiracy! mr hyde playing #mindgames with all of us: think carefully what you would do if someone tells you to not vote someone else... being salty etc.... wouldn't it let rise some suspects in you? you would probably ending to vote for that person on the election day!so basically mr hyde is a true follower of rhiload!#mindgamespart2 ~ what would happen if everybody, on the election day, think that everybody else will vote for rhiload following the same reasons ... and decide to vote for someone else? with the excuse: the others will vote for him anyway ~~#mindgames boiz!!!!!!! p.s. never let muricans vote again pls (pjsalt)"
2/9/2017,"i don't know what the cms is, but i do know you're an idiot."
2/9/2017,"i'm all for giving some new blood a chance but you have never really shown us a serious side and i will not support some random youtube memer for csm. i also don't want to just judge you based on your youtube without giving you a chance to show your serious side. i think the best way to do this would be to start actually talking about issues and solutions that you are passionate about in the game. a csm member needs to be passionate and willing to fight and debate to have their ideas considered by ccp (from what i understand). what are you passionate about changing or fixing in eve online?additionally i have a few more questions that focus on lowsec since you say that is your main area of focus within the campaign. how do you feel about the current state of lowsec pvp? is there anything in terms of balance that sticks out at you as being an issue? if so, how would you propose fixing the problem? how do you feel about the state of t3ds after the latest balancing that occurred in the last couple months. do you think it was enough to bring them down a bit to balance the ship meta? what is your opinion on how citadels are impacting lowsec groups? do you feel they are creating more content, being spammed too much, or are they causing any other issues from a lowsec perspective?"
2/9/2017,"fallout indeed...look forward to the video :)what are your thoughts on jump fatigue? does it need to be re-worked for ships like black ops, or jump bridges? or do you think it's working as intended?in addition, are you satisfied with the implementation of the new structures thus far or are there significant features you would like to see changed or re-balanced?"
2/9/2017,"i've heard words of approval about your campaign from most of my small gang friends but your platform appears pretty weak/non-existent. here are some questions: what do you identify as the biggest hurdles getting in the way of content creation in eve? there are many avenues of pvp in low-sec that can be as different from each other as night and day, from faction warfare to fights over moons to piracy to other objectiveless small gang/fleet pvp. which of these do you specifically care the most about? what do you think about the current state of pvp within your defined interests? what do you identify as the currently biggest balancing issues in the game, and how do you propose they get fixed?"
2/9/2017,"can everyone just cut the chit chat a-hole self righteous bullcrap ?first off, i don't like chance ravinne either, but i do respect his work as a content creator and i respect his work for the csm.second, mr. hyde, i respect you as a content creator and i think you've done amazing things for this communituy but maybe you should keep your mouth shut. i like trolling csm members just like everyone else but there is a difference between calling people out and poking them a little.you'll never be alone, you got gremlins."
2/9/2017,"rhiload has my vote because he makes me wee every time i watch one of his videos, and because hyde doesn't want me to vote for him."
2/9/2017,"i intend to speak for all players, for there is a good chance that am playing, or have played, your game, your eve. maybe it is a little vague and hand-wavy, you would be correct about that. i think i have been pretty straight forward - i am largely agnostic to what space you call home, what activities you call fun; whatever those are, i aim to demonstrate only that i have a good understanding of those things, what makes players tick, what makes the game interesting to them, and why they log in. therefore, i would be able to provide a good sounding board as to the merits and hazards of a particular change, having both the experience and the knowledge on a broad range of topics within eve. yes. i have no agenda - i accept that the csm exists to as a feedback mechanism. i have no issues working with many people in a professional context - everyone is on the same team, we all aim to make new eden better. whatever the topic, whatever the issues, i am signing up to be useful to ccp, not to make ccp useful to my alliance or play style specifically. everyone has gaps in their knowledge, but hopefully i have convinced some readers that, although i certainly have some knowledge gaps, if ccp should ask for feedback, i am able to evaluate and think critically about what the proposed changes would impact. it comes down to, do you trust me to have good enough insight into the game itself that you would want me to have a special spot in providing the first wave of feedback?first, i play this game, as in actually logged in, in excess of 5 hours a day. during that time i am in contact with players from all sorts of play styles. i am a regular poster on the eve-o forums, but these have rapidly fallen out of favor with the player base for various reasons, which has left the collective feedback rather scattered across the internet. i would be game to start a blog, or open another avenue for more regular communication if that is what players want. it should be obvious i am not shy about writing lots, and i enjoy interacting and discussing all aspects of this fine game. what avenue do you think is best?"
2/9/2017,"i'm primarily a hs player, i've used the wardec mechanic for four years, i am both biased and well versed of the mechanic and how it works. not as much as some other, like lord raz, vimsy and others, but enough to make educated opinions on the matter. i also dabble in small gang, and solo, on this character and my alts. stifle what content? they do not stifle content. they stop the content of pve'ers. not content in general. and to be perfectly honest. not everybody wants what you describe. most highsec pve alliance, and i mean true hs pve alliance, not a pve corp inside a lowsec alliance, want to be left alone. most pve'ers are pve'ers and do not like pvp interaction. so what you get is two conflicting systems. one which wants to fight and win, and other which wants to be ignored. this interaction obviously doesn't mix well. this is for a random dec, primarily because the wardecer/merc, take losses very very seriously. to the people where if one ship is lost during a wardec, it generally means that the other side has dealt a very healthy blow. a wardecers aim in a dec is a perfect ratio in their favor. contracts with mercenaries are different story, vairable by what the contact demands. also wars against merc corps are winnable. you force them to stay docked. you not only block them from killing you, you block them from killing everyone else as well. if an alliance has 100 wars, and you keep them docked in station, you suddenly make all that isk invested into wars, wasted. wardecs do not have predefined objectives. it is up to the parties involved to define their own objectives. in a random dec, meant purely for killing, a wardeccers object is simple. kill and dont be killed. by defining them that simple outcome, you technically win. even if you lose a few ships, you killed one of them. which hurts them a lot more than most people understand. as i said above. if you plainly show your fleet to the enemy and the enemy can see he will not win, he will not fight. same goes for everywhere in space. blue balling is a thing everywhere. as do fights in highsec, i've gotten in plenty of fights, three i can link videos of, over pos'es. here,here,and here. we both can agree that wardecs and highsec in general is stale and needs refreshing. i know and like the idea of structure based war in highsec. but i do not like the overall tone of your post making it seem like the defending corps are completely helpless.#deletetheweak"
2/9/2017,"i have always been a big fan of vic and his saltiness. he has some good ideas though, and i am sure that he will be passionate about this game when working with the csm."
2/9/2017,"valkin mordirc, you have a lot of valid points in your post - i will try to address each one.so let's talk. what pve people say they want, what people in general say they want, and what they actually want are not necessarily the same thing. generally you can be more sure of what they say when there's good evidence they have a broader and deeper amount of experiences and knowledge going into their opinion. if pve is all they have ever known, and in some cases it regrettably is, how much do i really trust they like it, having tried none of the alternatives?in this context - pve is often the only aspect of the game they actually know and can say with confidence that they like. have they tried jousting spaceships? certainly the success of groups like spectre and other assorted npsi groups shows there is a large market for trying to break into what is a very, at first, confusing and punishing aspect of the game - pvp. when their first experience is just outright being denied their game play with no substitute, they will tend to have a terrible experience with it. i can say that a healthy amount of players that i have talked to, myself included, started as a missioner and gradually realized it was the worst part of the game once they had proper exposure to the really fun parts. that's where the problem is, the first experiences shouldn't be a denial of what they currently consider fun, they should be engaging in other ways. carrots, not sticks.as i detailed in a previous post, they need to see something tangible other than making you dock, to actually want to put effort in. you took their pve paradise of rats and lp - what can they either take from you, or do to get that state back? if the answer is neither to both, than you can expect non-participation, which doesn't exactly inspire the player base.while that is tactically and technically correct, it's not a victory condition most people are either excited to work towards, nor is it really all that engaging. while ccp hasn't nearly eradicated mechanics which encourage these tactics, and neither have player groups stopped using them as a crutch, i think we can all agree that is not an optimal solution. there needs to be a penalty for not participating in a war that you started.perhaps you are correct. maybe. so here's the deal. most things in eve are an acquired taste. someone else shows you an aspect of the game. sometimes people do this though blogs or youtube videos, or whatever, but usually its a friend or acquaintance that makes it interesting enough to check out. maybe you and i both know a decced corp is not helpless. yes, they could make you dock up and deny you content. we may have a developed a taste and an appreciation for this after probably many years. however, it is an aquired taste. you can't expect everyone to like it the first time. not without instruction. heck it could be years before the subtleties of such a taste can even make themselves known to a palette that has only known shallow games in today's fast-food pay to win game design climate. a lot of people would probably like jousting space ships if their first experience with it wasn't so negative, where the best solution (as they see it) was non-participation.i'm not against hi-sec antagonism. heck, i've done my fair share of it. if you want a more interesting game, a game which encourages participation, a game which more people will stick with to learn to taste and savor those subtleties, a more apparent and exciting goal or anti-goal is needed to make wardecs something that will generate content more often, for a wider variety of players, and provide a positive experience where their view of the game is widened. go ahead and smash their fleets with t3cs and over-comped logi, sure, they still have to physically win a fleet fight, but at least give them an objective they could win - just as you always retain the ability to deny them their pve paradise, it seems only fair that they should be able to deny you, in some way, the ability to keep decs up indefinitely. i do not like one size fit solutions. phoebe's jump range changes did reign in a lot of the silliness with the game, but it really did put a hamper on legitimate use of capitals. in the same vein, i would hate for any change to wardecs to affect legitimate merc activity just because the blue-doughnut of blanket deccers are, at least in my appraisal, abusing the mechanic. whatever the fix is, it must be not hamper the legitimate use of wardecs."
2/9/2017,"i like vic.i joined his alliance on my very first safari. he gave me money and good advice and i didn't steal from them because they were so nice.he's a good guy, and very knowledgable. unfortunately this niceness forced me to create another alt and steal from someone else, but hey that's eve, right?"
2/9/2017,"as someone who flies with jonatan on most fleets, i can vouch for his knowledge of the game, his will to help our group and his leadership in all combat situations. he is also the kind of guy that will listen to your ideas and give you constructive criticism on them. i think he'll be a great addition to the council."

2/9/2017,"thank you so much for the support!it has always disappointed me that eve has such amazing, well-written, deep lore, but almost none of if makes it into the actual game. i've devoured the chronicles and short stories, and the live events that do happen are incredible.as you say, immersion plays a big role in making eve, and really any other game, memorable and enjoyable. part of what makes me love this game so much is those moments when the immersion just clicks and you really feel that sense of awe at something that you could never see in everyday life."
2/9/2017,are you going to make liquid ozone a charge?
2/9/2017,dancul is insanely good at picking apart game mechanics pretty much naturally. he'd be a good fit to the csm.

2/10/2017,"you realize that ccp has made mutli-boxing harder right? people who use to isbox 100 mining barges, dont do that anymore. you say the player base has gone down 20k, but do you take into consideration these isbox miners/incursion runners? in 2011 over by antem in genesis, the high sec system next door to antem had a isboxer who would run 100 barges. 2 charons and an orca. i am pretty sure that constituted for 100, if not more of the 20,000 ""players"" you talk about.now also the fighter change. i know i stopped multiboxing supers and carriers. as well as many other players. if you consider maybe, 100 players who stopped multiboxing 2. you are talking 200 accounts/character slots that are useless. did they unsub? is 200 a fair assessment? probably not.so, in the years you have been playing. i am pretty positive that 4000-6000 accounts got shut off because of isboxer. another 1000-3000 were banned.yes, i am going to throw numbers out there. cause they are a lot more practical than ""20,000 player decline and suicide ganking is to blame!"""
2/10/2017,"jump range was nerfed out of stupidity. they did it to keep from power projecting across all of eve. however, the original implementation of the range and timer nerf was so heavy handed that it kept people from wanting to move any capitals. people would rather self-destruct and collect insurance on dreads/carriers, and they would rather sell their supercarriers or titans than move them with the range and fatigue nerf bat. hell, i know several people who just let their supers unsub because ccp wouldnt move them and they couldn't sell them where they are located. they still play and they just recently decided to resub them with the new range changes. they should have left range the same as it was pre-phoebe and just left us with the fatigue. doing both was dumb."

2/10/2017,that would actually be a huge quality of life improvement good idea
2/10/2017,pushing fir the little things initiative to come back. its been successful in the past and i feel it is a great opportunity to get it going again.
2/10/2017,i suppose the big one is: what do you consider to be the most important things in need of changing with regards to industry?
2/10/2017,"so this is a variable question based on what level of industry you do. so lets break it up into little things for each level / things that fit into the roadmap moving forward for ccpt1 products mineral based / can help all. adding runs remaining as a visual indicator on the bpc picture would be a huge benefit to everyone.. especially those of us with thousands of bpcst2/t3 productionso start from the beginning for this one. so moon mining first. mining arrays are an opportunity to break away from what can only be considered.... mining arrays give an opportunity to make a interface with reactions and moon mining that isn't frankly a painful long process to deal with. simplified interface that is easy to comprehend what is happening and if it is setup correctly. additionally using the upwell access lists allow for tower tending from select groups of people without giving them access to fuel bays and etc but enough to actually have them do their work. this isn't a little thing but this is something i work with often and is part of the road map moving into this fall. t3 specifically wormholes need some love. 100% of wormhole residents will say contradicting ideas on how to do it ill add a simple one. asteroid belts in wormholes. gets people into space as mining as protection as response fleets, and as hunters. its simple and will seriously help wormhole industry. so lets step over to pi getting cpp to change pi as a system probably wont happen any time soon. but making small changes like being able to interact and launch materials to customs offices remotely would be a huge qol bonus. though changing pi from start to finish wouldn't hurt in my opinion... or add it to the mobile app for moving extractor heads around. new esi api system may create options for this provided the endpoints are there. advanced industrycontinued work with api and new endpoints for pulling more information / making the api pulls more readable to the general public. citadel endpoints are key here growing these to allow for market data to be more complete is a great tool.lastly reverse the decision by ccp and the current csm to not release regional industry data. this is a huge market forecasting tool and its going to mean issues down the road. the argument of ""its free intel"" is easily countered with ""that's the cost of doing business."" its not inconceivable that concord gather info on this considering you do pay them for the space...."
2/10/2017,"scylus,since you are focused more on faction warfare gameplay and we have two pirate lowsec candidates right now, i want to focus asking some questions that involve just faction warfare you already mentioned the citadel problem which i believe ccp themselves stated they overlooked (i think i read that somewhere in csm minutes?), so i won't go thereinstead i want to focus on the more pve side of faction warfare, and a major isk sink that is the lp store and lp payout do you feel right now that the lp store is in a good place? are there any buffs or nerfs to the store itself that you feel are needed?lastly, what is your position on a militia receiving 50% payout while in tier 1?"
2/10/2017,"you get my vote, the only true csm"
2/10/2017,don't vote with what's in your pants...
2/10/2017,exactly.
2/10/2017,"as a csm member, what changes do you feel you could make if any to encourage more female eve players?"
2/10/2017,"i don't vote at all!but some good advertisement is always welcome!csm is useless anyway, and people on csm do their own business! like normal politic, nothing different"
2/10/2017,"right now, the best tool at my disposal is word-of-mouth. without ccp's implicit/explicit consent, that's really all i have. not that w-o-m is a bad thing; many grassroots campaigns began that way. ultimately, this is ccp's baby. i'm just a nursemaid. if i do make the cut, then i'll have ccp's ear to whisper sweet nothings in to. this is really about marketing, and whether ccp feels changes to their plan warrant the expense. sometimes, the best plan is none at all."
2/10/2017,"i think wormhole space isn't in a bad space, but i think its definitely been neglected. overall i think the 1 item will do the most to help wormhole space out is rebalancing combat sites so that they have a despawn timer, which will allow for better isk. upping the isk/reward"
2/10/2017,"its definitely an idea that i've had thrown around with a lot of lower level wormhole corps and the feeling is almost unanimous. it takes groups like hard knocks, lazerhawks and inner hell and moves them from incredibly difficult to evict, to near impossible to evict.i feel like this isn't a balance thing we need, as keepstars are designed to fight super capital fleets, and there's no counterplay in wormhole space. explaining it this way.group a forms a coalition to evict group b. group b is an established, capable wh group, with 300 active characters, and approximately 100 capital ships in their home hole ( for arguements sake, lets say 50 dreads, 30 faxes, and 20 carriers). in order to be able to come, fight, and have a chance of winning, the attacking force should at least have parity with the defending force (we're not taking things like player skill and such into consideration, as this is already a complicated enough example). so that means group a needs 100 capitals + a sub capital fleet to match b's capital assets alone. given that a keepstar's doomsdays can kill multiple capitals or effectively kill multiple caps quite quickly, we also need to compensate for that. we'll say we need 50 more capitals to have a reasonable shot of being successful.ok, so now that we've determined that we need 150 capitals to consider pulling this off, we'll need a subcap fleet for support. which will say 300 should be sufficient (arbitrary number, but whatever).so with 150 capitals, that means we would need to be able to jump through 50 capital capable wormhole connections. given that group b is much more likely based out a c5 (as c6 space is dead), we'll assume the number of wormholes there to be 500 (there's more than that, but rough math here).so given an even probably of rolling into it (again, not completely true, but good enough for our example), that means group a would have to roll something in the order of 25000 wormholes to get the capital fleet in. lets say group a has 24/7 activity, and can roll a wormhole nonstop in... 8 minutes (generally speaking, if you're ragerolling, it can be done in about 3 minutes, but we'll give some leeway for things like rolling fatigue).how long would it take to get a force into that wormhole? about 140 days. that's 1/3rd of a year committed to this. there is no group in eve that can handle this kind of slog, or would consider even doing it.now that doesn't even take into account the groups that are large in c4 space. what if they managed to anchor a keepstar? with 0 capital assets able to get in... you're looking at a tidi fest to end all tidi fests in wh space, which is already notoriously light on server resources.how would i deal with removing keepstars? i don't know. i'm not going to announce something until i have a plan to deal with it. it's true that i feel that it is an unbalanced and unfair mechanic (in my opinion almost as bad as a 1-sided infini-gun from back in the day), and i won't lie about that.how would we compensate the people who already have keepstars up? again, i don't know.would fortizars be sufficient as the best anchorable structure in j-space? i don't know. i feel like there could be a fortizar+ that's only anchorable in wh space that has some kind of toned down keepstar doomsday, and i think that would be much more fair.so why would i suggest something that i don't know the answer for? it's true that i don't like keepstars in wh space, but i've held that opinion since day 1, because i feel it's a very 1-sided advantage for the defender, and essentially creates such a huge boon for the defensive side, that it becomes near impossible for an attacker to win. and that's with 1 keepstar. a group such as hk which has 2 on the same grid, how do you deal with that?so i'm open to suggestions about what to do. but i don't know an appropriate path yet, so i didn't want to add it to my campaign."
2/10/2017,^ are you actually braindead?
2/10/2017,"by your own math the majority of the eviction difficulty isn't the keepstar -- it's the corporation behind it. most people would have a difficult time evicting hk/lzhx/inner hell before keepstars, now they still have a difficult time.you don't rageroll c5s to seed that many dreads into someone. put a scanner in their home and seed them through their own chain while they're asleep.since c4 keepstars are so unkillable if you anchor one in your c4 before voting opens (march 6th) i'll vote for you first on 16 accounts and post proof:"
2/10/2017,"you're invalidating your own point by using an argument that has been the case in every single eviction and heavily relies on participation from both sides. if we take all structures out of consideration and look at the use of pos towers, you'd have the exact same problem you're dealing with before you even reach said structure. a group such as hk is entrenched enough that the structure in itself isn't so much the problem. it could be a fortizar and they still put up a similar defense.if you want to evict anyone, that above quote is a requirement regardless of what structure your opponent has to defend itself. if you can't bring the logistics to defeat the defending armies, you're not going to evict them even if they would live in small towers."
2/10/2017,"i'm not arguing that the majority of the difficulty of an eviction is what's existing, i'm arguing that the keepstar pushes it from incredibly difficult to near impossible. groups such as lazerhawks, hk, and inner hell are already very well established groups, i'm not arguing for an easy way of evicting them, i'm arguing for not making it essentially impossible.regarding anchoring a keepstar, even if i had the isk, which i clearly don't, i wouldn't. 6 vinatieri: i respect that csm is a feedback group, but feedback should go both ways, there's probably been plenty of ideas that ccp has implemented based off of or inspired by player ideas. i bring ideas to the table. i want to listen to ideas, and improve upon them."
2/10/2017,"finally, a csm candidate i can get behind."
2/10/2017,white's a good man and i have faith that he will serve all of lowsec's interests well.
2/10/2017,"good luck white, i hate lowsec but you have my vote for sure :)(just be sure to send me free stuff ok?)"
2/10/2017,"love me some low-sec representation, love me some waffleseasy choice for a csm candidate."
2/10/2017,"i'd be happy with more nullsec > wh space wormholes, especially for higher class wormholes like c4s and c5s. quantum flux generators right now are pretty useless i've done a few experiments with them myself and they are pretty weak. they could probably use looking at.contributer to eve is easy:"
2/10/2017,"the navy caracal is bad because hams/hmls need some help, and it doesn't get a bonus to rlmls which are op. the naga and rokh don't really fit the current metagame at the moment. with rlmls getting balanced then maybe the naga will see some more action, and the rokh will hopefully get better with bs sensor adjustments and less pirate ship proliferation. contributer to eve is easy:"
2/10/2017,"from what i have heard chance has done a good job in his term on the csm, unlike hyde who has failed to attend on a number of occasions, and so not sure why the insults against another csm member are necessary in this case. hyde, your giving solo and small gang pvpers a bad reputation.i won't be voting for rihload anyway as i can't see what he is going to bring to the table. but the personal insults just leave a bad taste and have probably increased rihload's chances of being elected."
2/10/2017,"you are easily manipulated, kid"

2/10/2017,"i like that you didn't purely focus on the pvp aspect of lowsec life. what are some things you believe can be improved upon for the overall health of the lowsec ecosystem?how would you go about communicating issues from all lowsec residents (fw, pirate, and strictly pve) to ccp?what potential changes that were announced do you feel area gamebreaking to lowsec but not any other space, if anything at all (not counting citadels in fw space)?you mentioned increasing lp payout for faction militias for killing an opposing faction's player. are there any other lp buffs that you would be behind? how do you feel about a faction at tier 1 receiving 50% of their normal payout as it currently stands?"
2/10/2017,"one of the best members of the previous csm in terms of productivity and contribution, so will definitely be top pick for me. glad you are standing again this year."
2/10/2017,"hi, i am xenuria. i was in pl once, it was ok. what experience do you have interacting with people in an in-person setting?"
2/10/2017,ive known jt for along time great guy he has my support and vote for csm.
2/10/2017,"***if you send me 1 million isk, i'll return 10x more right back at you.***"
2/10/2017,"i appreciate the fact you want to improve wh space, but i am curious how much time you have actually lived in one. from your post it sound like you are a ns guy who is just interested in wormholes.i echo the previous posters that i would like to hear more of your ideas with details."
2/10/2017,"i tried to read your post, but the grammar feels like something from google translate."
2/10/2017,"one of the reasons many groups live in wormholespace, is that mass limits forces the small(er) fleet sizes.how do you think the ability to increase fleet size will improve wormhole space?"
2/10/2017,"50\50.on the one hand complicate the closing holes \ crit in order to something: rolling to search fleets, secure system for make money, mining etc.on the other hand it will facilitate input on big fights, capital carriage (also balance the pilots, which cover the hole way to capital ship + 50000 mwd: jump without use mwd and jump back with mwd in during jump animation)."
2/10/2017,"i thought about all the ways i could explain how this would benefit already large pvp corps that print money in high class wh space (now c4s with a c5 or c6 static), but i don't think its worth it. expanding the mass on a wormhole / jump cloning into cits - these are ideas that would turn wormhole space more into k-space. i'm all for making more money in wormhole space, if there's more people that want to bear because they can make the cost of their ship back pretty quick - that's what would get wormhole space hopping again.the ideas you posted are not good. you also mention nothing about wormhole dynamics (bear, indy, pvp) - i could edit: stalk (not troll) your killboard and corp history, but i feel if you want to be taken seriously maybe say something about what you do in wormholes and about the various play styles. perhaps also mention how you perceive the health of wormhole space. too much / little bearing? not enough targets? too many large corps / not enough? good on you for putting yourself out there. you won't get my vote this year; but good luck all the same."
2/10/2017,"corp bio is in russian, if he's bi-lingual then props to him. there's a fairly large russian playerbase in wormhole space and they deserve to be heard. maybe not by this guy though."
2/10/2017,"thanks noxisia arkana.this topic just kidding and reated just like that. i know about csm: this member is a powerful, know game mechanic and see what need to improve game. also known for a large number of people and may irl fly to ccp base.another answers:1. for mass i think create player things what may to expand stability mass for some operations.2. too much / little bearing?too much and too much safety in hi level statics. because many 5 system are either this is someone's farm or desert system, and that small amount is the main or subsidiary of the corporation or alliance.3. not enough targets?true pvp need rolling many many system for find targets.4. too many large corps / not enough? no. all good here."
2/10/2017,"i think your a bit too early for april fools, please go stand in the corner and think about what you did."
2/10/2017,"add new ideas: 6. j-kingdom!everyone knows that ssr did wh with the aim of the movement through k-space.but there began to live and make money, to fight for life in the system.sometimes, after the growth of the corporation, all may not be enough money for the t3 and they are in other systems to create a farm with alt-accounts. but records show the system name, constellation and even the region. wh is not a hole but a system with the sun, with pos\the citadel and capsuleers without local chat and constant input.here's an idea: create the ability to move jump clones between the systems in your constellation. this process can complicate the ""search"" links to your other station.this can be done in the service of the citadel using fuel without timer or with him. components - some things in data / relic sites.this will help in the development of wh systems, more rapid invocation of a new green anomalyes in the region. to increase the influence of corporation or alliance will give impetus to conquer all the systems of constellations.7. make fozziesov great again!where are you in real life saw the change of flag is accompanied by a small fishing probes in a particular area?to not abused ccp fozzie, you just need to remove appearing out of nowhere in the constellation of probes. or create a bpo and submit it to the market that will hinder the speed capture system.because it just makes the game boring, and there are a lot of people.example: entosis in m-o that means - takes m-o sovereignty not a constelation!"
2/10/2017,"i know this, and it's unfortunate that i know many things i would like to see changed for the better i may not even be able to introduce if elected."
2/11/2017,"i think t1 heavies should be available. there's always the argument of ccp tempting players to sub but what many forget is that there are a whole lot of other things that are tempting. no serious alpha player who can grind for plex will stay in alpha status. their contribution to ccp would be in the form of plex. lock out alphas on utility drones, fine but at least provide the t1 heavies for some ratting potential, thus isk. it's t1 lol."
2/11/2017,"i don't understand what so urgently needs fixing with moon mining, and i'm really wary of what solution ccp would bring. like when they ""fixed"" t2 production which totally crashed that market while making the ui only somewhat less of a clickfest than it used to be (much better-looking, though). same thing with when exploration was ""fixed"", which over a few months completely killed w-space exploration sites.let's face it: if individual players are able to farm a resource to the ground, they will. because they can't count, because they can't do opportunity costs, and because even when they can count or do opportunity cost their reasoning is they'll take a part of a smaller pie rather than no part of a bigger one.the one thing the current system for moon mining has is capped output on the rarer goos. even though most moons aren't profitable because of overproduction, at least there are some actual money moons, which people will organize into alliances to fight over and hold. or which people will take the trouble to recon and try to ninja, hoping no-one catches them. if moons are turned into yet another form of endlessly farmable resource, the game will lose out. nobody fights over asteroid belts, mining anomalies or pi planets, after all."
2/11/2017,so its no that moon mining needs fixing. its that the mining arrays are taking that over for the current pos system and for the reasons you listed above and for others it really does need to be something that ccp has some people who have the knowledge of the market of industry and of the current systems to help them make it better. in terms fo what needs to be fixed with the old system pos management sucks. access lists and everything else need to have the right options for these and the interface for how they are run needs to be considered.
2/11/2017,"in response to the reduction of seats for csm xii, commander aze, roedyn, and myself are encouraging anyone interested in seeing more highsec representation in the next csm to vote for the three of us as their first three choices. vote strategically and vote for highsec."
2/11/2017,"prometheus,thank you for posting this you brought up pve, lp stores and tier penalties so i'll comment on those i do want to circle back to the low sec pirate piece as i believe our platform will support those candidates also pve is fine if you are in tier 2 obviously tier 1 can create some stress however it should be a motivating factor to partner with the rest of the militia to get out of tier 1 the upgrade system does not promote this if the tiers were driven by system control it would incentivize the militia to take systems vs just upgrading the hub it would also improve the content of fights and demand improved skill sets from the pilots just to competethe lp store needs to have inventory catered to fw and low sec currently it has everything found in a high sec store granted fw lp is gained quicker than high sec lp however there is nothing special about the fw store if there were items exclusive to it this could attract pilots to get involved in low sec even revisiting the tags and how they are applied to goods in the storetier 1 should be 100% payout with bonuses at higher tiers it's not an indictment on a militia for being in tier 1 when the mechanic needs to be improved to evolve with the rest of the game if the goal is to attract more talent, pvpers and content then the systems in place should compliment that goal as for my two pirate colleagues, faction warfare is often used as a ""stepping stone"" for piracy and other aspects of the game the small print is if you are in fw long enough your sec status will be negative we all want content we love pvp so any improvement in low sec that supports that goal is worth discussing imhoscylus former executor templis calsf alliance"
2/11/2017,"scylusthanks! lastly, what are some ways you feel you can connect to lowsec players and convey their thoughts, feelings, and opinions to ccp?"
2/11/2017,"i think we've struck a good balance with townhalls and direct contact (be it contacting subsections of the community directly or being contacted by the public) and i'd like to continue those moving forward... there is always room for improvement. i'd probably like to see townhalls used more than just pre-summit too. i did put together a nullsec focus group before the first summit, consisting of leadership and fc's from all over nullsec (i think we ended up with around 30 people). i believe we did get a lot of useful information and pain points to bring to ccp out of that focus group, but i'm not convinced its the best way of collecting information. townhalls collect roughly the same information in a much more effective and immediate way.i can't say this enough. csm xi has taken the damaged relationship we started with and with help from ccp transformed it into a fruitful cohabitation of sorts. there were devs who had been burnt by previous experiences which didn't want to talk to the csm for many months (which is completely understandable) and we were able to both integrate ourselves into their work and integrate them back into the csm as an institution. this speaks more (and highly) about the personalities of s than anything else.being able to continue this relationship and help the next wave of csm's acquaint themselves with the very complicated world that is ccp, while continuing the current workload with as little downtime as possible, is something i strongly believe is important. the perfect example is steve ronuken who cut down what i would estimate as 3 months of catch up at the start of our term into a few weeks. the shorter the catch up period the more work a csm group can do with their term.other than that, showing up to every meeting ccp has called or scheduled has shown me the use of doing just that. while not all meetings will have a lot to talk about, some are vitally important, and you never know when those will pop up. i don't think anyone could argue my commitment to the csm, ccp or the community with how much time and effort i've put in over the last year. i want to continue doing all of this for the betterment of the game and the community. hopefully this helps make me worthy of your vote."
2/11/2017,"while in recent years there's been several csm representatives hailing from the autz, i don't think i've met one who has been as proactive when it comes to seeking input from the community and promoting the csm and what it can accomplish.his work ethic is clear from his perfect attendance in csm meetings and his willingness to listen and advance the players' concerns to ccp has been demonstrated. i think the judge has earned a second term."
2/11/2017,"before you secure my vote, i need a csm-related pickup line."
2/11/2017,you presented a good suggestion on how to rebalance rlml in this reddit post:
2/11/2017,"formerly respected player, currently member of goonswarm"
2/11/2017,are you with the cartel? because you're definitely an angel.contributer to eve is easy:
2/11/2017,"acs gain the least by going up tiers, more falloff from going to 220 or 425 would be nice. you also lose so much tracking going to 425 from 220 that it's usually not worth it, so reducing the tracking loss between tiers would be nice too. i also feel like acs have the worst t2 ammo selection. not having scorch/null feels like hell on blasters/pulse but barrage isn't nearly as useful as those two types. maybe putting a big optimal increase on barrage would be nice, i.e. instead of 1.5x more like 3x (this works for acs since its ac exclusive so wouldn't break arty, would make optimal bonused ships like jaguar, munnin etc. better with acs too instead of wasted bonus) right now blasters seem to win against acs at scram kiting which this would help with. contributer to eve is easy:"
2/11/2017,"great response, and i learned something from it. thanks suitonia."
2/11/2017,it's so funny how a **** talking post actually did the opposite of what the author intended it to do. bitter vet vs youtuber > 0 - 1
2/11/2017,planetary interaction needs a level of improvements to make it enjoyable and accessible to people. it will cut in some extreme players profits but for overall mechanics there needs to be improvements.
2/11/2017,go erika freelancers wish you best of luck :d
2/11/2017,"i have always enjoyed looking at the reports personally because i just found it interesting to see all the isk flows around the game. i won't turn down graph porn. that said tho, i also haven't really use the stats other than to feed my graph porn quota. it's sad that they aren't going to be doing the regional stats anymore, but i don't see it having too much effect really overall. while not to same extent, we do have other resources to also get similar data for those who use it."
2/11/2017,thank you! i really appreciate it!
2/11/2017,very much this. thank you.
2/11/2017,thank you for the support!
2/11/2017,"sending out an e.s.s.let's talk about content.on paper, on release, the ess was probably one of the best single ideas in years. in one new item, you had a way to make nullsec more profitable, have a way for ratters to risk a little bit more to gain more rewards, fight liquid isk inflation via the lp earned, and a content seed for small gangs to actually get some interaction with the locals. perfect! players soon realized that the rats could do their dirty work for them. content seed lost. i presume they haven't really examined this or revisited it, potentially waiting on some grand revision of rat ai. it's sort of a shame, it has the potential to solve so many ills all at once. defending your home should mean more than timers - active defense and curating of your space should yield far more substantive rewards than it does; the game should be heading towards more mechanisms that reward participation and 'active' mechanics. i would think it would be great to revisit the ess.on paper, the mobile siphon unit was probably one of the best single ideas in years. in one new item, you had a way to steal from the rich and give yourself! perfect! players soon realized that the api could give them instant, free, reliable intel as to make the siphons anything but covert. content seed lost, liabilities, lost. i presume they have not revisited these due to the 'imminent' removal of pos....when imminent is measured in years. they were a great idea that got very little support. i wonder why. just saying, if i was on the csm, i wouldn't be beholden to any interests which quite frankly, were probably quite happy with the siphons performance.citadels may be the very impetus for big ticket content, but they are harming content generation among smaller groups. no longer can you try and force a fight on a station during a small roam - the defenders can force youa off without ever risking anything. i hate to say it but eve is becoming way too safe - the entire charm of the game was that all risks weren't voluntary."
2/11/2017,i fly with vic and he knows and loves this game.+1
2/11/2017,"i think that my fw changes i advocate for will definitely help the health of the average lowsec inhabitant, and have been asked for by the overall fw community and regular lowsec pvp'ers for the past few yearsi really liked noobman's townhalls that he did for wormholes. i'd use the same format in conjunction with any other lowsec representatives so that we could as a group bring up all of our collective issues and discuss them with the lowsec community at large. dev's would be invited to attend and listen/speak and members in general would be invited to submit suggestions, bugs, and issues in general to any of the csm lowsec representatives that would be present to bring up in the meeting for discussion. unfortunately, i have proposed changes that are some of the same changes beyond the fw citadel changes that previous csm members have pushed for and ccp have mostly ignored. i'm not the only lowsec candidate this year, and i'm really hoping that the lowsec community at large will vote en masse this year to push more representatives of our gameplay and lifestyle onto the csm so maybe ccp will finally listen to our problems and suggestions seriously. additionally, the serious talk of drilling platforms replacing poses within the next year in accordance with the roadmap demands that lowsec players from both fw and the larger lowsec alliances be involved deeply with these mechanics because....the drilling platform changes effect both fw and non-fw lowsec alliance. they both derive content and income over those moon towers. i think that using current citadel mechanics, mostly in the way vulnerability timers work, is complete **** frankly. it takes the timezone defense to obscene levels. at least right now you can strontkite if a tower is going to have an unfavorable timer for reinforce. there's no ability to strontkite on citadels without keeping a minimum amount of dps required to pause the timer until the reinforce cycle is favorable to you. in general i really feel like current citadel mechanics being brought to the moon mining area is the single biggest threat to lowsec, for the reasons i explained above.fw was never intended to be a pve-centric system. it was designed as a pvp system with pve incentives. i am behind increasing pvp interactions by adjusting fw lp payouts for pvp activities, but not pve. i appreciate your input obviously on all of my ideas."
2/11/2017,"i would argue that if there are more pve-focused activities, such as increasing lp payout for tier 1 systems to something reasonable (like to 75% payout, rather than the current 50% payout), it would give more incentive to flip systems, and thus generate pvp by default. the side effect of that is more warp-core stabbed frigates running plexes, but imo that's the same frustration as roaming in nullsec and being reported 10 jumps out.other than that, thanks for taking time to really reply to my questions."
2/11/2017,"no problem. obviously i'm open to feedback and you make a good point. increases in fw payout like such can have benefits and side effects that transcend the simple ""pve vs pvp"". i just like that as a rule of thumb when talking about buffing lp payouts as a whole."
2/11/2017,"no question, you have my vote in this year too, sir"
2/11/2017,hey there dude. no questions but support of 7 accounts :)
2/11/2017,"this guy has been an excellent , but he is humble and doesn't brag enough about what he has helped with. i support his csm xii candidacy and urge others to vote for him."
2/11/2017,make wars opt-in.
2/11/2017,"that is definitely an option that has crossed my mind. corporations can choose to be unable to declare or receive wardecs.that would take a lot of balancing, though. at the very least, i think it would need to be an unchangeable property of the corporation selected as part of the corporation creation process, and corporations could only form alliances with other corporations with the same opt-in status."
2/11/2017,"even if i'm not that much into the gameplay aspect you want to change, i wish you good luck with your csm election. there will be enough pure 0.0 / pvp candidates already and eve uni has usualy a good coverage of all aspects of eve.be careful with that. wardec's may be a pain in the *** sometimes, especially for smaller corps, but they are also a essential part of the sandbox. it would be better to reduce the wardecs you can have at once to a small number. that would make smaller corps and alliances more unattractive for ""casual"" wardecs because the attacker has to make a decision which target brings his corp enough content / targets (and that's was it is about mostly).lorewise: yes, please. i mostly like it when ccp doesn't put it in in form of events or missions. loved the caroline's star thing for example. nothing was said about it, there was just this little new star growing bigger and bigger until somone was wondering ""hey, what's that?"" and things started rolling. or more lore-related, unique sites ""seeded"" into the universe to be found and explored.pve: i like the general direction ccp is taking at the moment with lesser, but much cleverer npc's. burners were a good start and the response-fleets from the mining npc's actualy use pvp tactics (logis, tackle, etc.). much more engaging than just grind these little red dot's on the overview."
2/11/2017,edit because of fail
2/11/2017,"let's not go crazy on the changes now. opt-in wars is not something that any eve player should strive for. conflict is the most important aspect of eve. it drives both the economy and the ingame content.what you should look for is ways of making wars more fun, not removing them."
2/11/2017,"the wardec system definitely needs some changes, but nuking it completely is a bad idea, and making war decs opt-in basically turns it into faction warfare. still, the issues you stand for are some that have been here since the earliest days of the game. pve combat and missions need to be changed at the fundamental level if they're going to stay a main source of content, especially with all that's going on in null nowadays. a full wiki on the game with a similar style to the uni-wiki would be extremely useful to new players and those looking advance their knowledge. eve is one of the most complex mmos ever made in terms of both mechanics and possibilities, and information on those need to be available. and finally, as a person who played both wow and runescape for the lore aspects when i was younger, i can't welcome a lore edition to the game enough!for these reasons, you're definitely on the shortlist for my final vote :d"
2/11/2017,no thanks
2/11/2017,"hello, will explo data sites get a buff or rework?"
2/11/2017,"thank you for your support! even if i may disagree with other people on what can be done to improve eve, ultimately i want the same thing that they do: for eve to be the best game it can possibly be. :)"
2/11/2017,"what for?the whole point of incursions is that they're a form of group pve (even if many public fleets have people multiboxing or downright semi-afk). if a player wants to solo pve, there are lots of anomalies, signatures and missions he can do. what would adding he same content with a vague sansha flavor add to the game? roleplaying?supply and demand.increasing supply doesn't automatically make people richer. see how ccp ""buffed"" exploration and killed w-space explo sites as a result. right now, people are farming tags. if you add more tags to the market, you'll just hit the income of those who are bringing in the existing tags. any reason why the game would be better off, besides the fact that you want to buff a gameplay you know and hit one you don't?btw, kudos for the work on helping to maintain the e-uni wiki, that job probably benefits the community more than the entire csm."
2/11/2017,ccp didn't confirm my application to run for csm yet.have faith.
2/11/2017,"when you submitted the form, did it return to the form, or tell you it was successful?it should tell you that you're successful, but it's a trifle flaky. doesn't like waiting around for any real length of time.what i recommend: make sure that the two bits of text in it are below the character limit. have them waiting in notepad, ready to copy and paste reload the submission form fill everything in quickly (including picking the character you're running as) submit immediately. if you want to check, go back to"

2/11/2017,"sorry for the late reply; i have been extremely busy packing up to head back home and i haven't had much time to myself lately. i have recently left mcav due to issues i had with ore sites in w-space; as well as a new capital i have acquired. let me say first that i still have intentions to help improve w-space; and i may someday return.though, that is not the only thing that i want to focus on. now, let's be honest; w-space is not nearly what it used to be; and it will never be the same as it once used to be.i have 2 focus points for w-space. 1. ore sites; or the lack thereof.2. bringing new players to w-spacei'll start with mining in w-space1. generic ore2. no guarantee of an ore site3. no safety (unless you have a rorq; see #4)4. mass on a hole if using a rorq (or inability to use rorq in static because the hole is not large enough)nullsec1. plethora of better ore2. guaranteed ore no matter what ie anoms or asteroid belts3. system cyno jam, bubbles on gate, easy to use rorq4. ??? profit?i'd like to see better ore in w-space, sites should also respawn if left untouched for 1-2 days.now; i know that the csm are not devs, and they only bridge the gap between the player base, and ccp.i know these issues were brought up to a couple of csm members during a recent townhall, and it would be nice to bring it up with ccp. i personally asked about seeing roaming npc miners, but unfortunately it is not possible for w-space.bringing new players, and new corporations to w-space. i believe that making changes to the industry side of w-space would bring in some industry based corporations. keeping in mind that i have not played through the entire npe, but as far as i know there is no part of w-space in it. it would be great to see a ""further along"" part of the npe that touches base with wormhole space and lets these new players know that living in wormholes is actually a thing. bloemkoolsaus , please be concrete!! we understand you'll want feedback but we need to know that you can identify problems corrently on your own as being on the csm, you will likely have to look at issues under the nda and cannot ask for any community feedback.""i am well aware of having to keep certain things secret, that is one benefits to being in the military ;)timoxa zero, ""also, you haven't addressed the issue with z142 nullsec holes in c5 space being closed but still being visually ""open"". do you plan on interfacing with ccp to try and get this bug fixed?""i have not yet replicated this issue, as i have found a few z142 null holes in static c5's and have not yet had any issues.if you encounter this problem again please submit a bug report and send me a mail to confirm that this is still happening.edward harris,""this makes it sound like you want to build a wall and lie to us.""ya got me! :)see above^aaril, ""i appreciate the fact you want to improve wh space, but i am curious how much time you have actually lived in one. from your post it sound like you are a ns guy who is just interested in wormholes.""i have been in and out of wormholes since 2014 up until about half a year ago; when i joined mcav and learned in detail a lot more about w-space, diplomatics, etc.if anyone has any more questions, please send me a mail in-game!"
2/11/2017,"man you joined darkness the only thing you're still doing is making yourself an embarrassment.leaving a w-space corp and moving to nullsec over ""ore site issues"" and acquiring a ""new capital"" certainly sounds like someone with the experience required to sit on the csm."
2/11/2017,"frankly, this is eve. and i have the freedom to go and do whatever i please. if you dislike this so much maybe you should try to run for csm.i had too many subbed accounts lying around being useless because they were almost fully skilled miners; to add on to that most known corps won't let you just bring 1 toon into their group that can only fly fax and up. but then again you may not know that because hk have a lot of connections."
2/12/2017,"for those of you who are interested in how i see the csm, i made a video here which i think sums it up nicely."
2/12/2017,"main focus: game content/ pve / tools / 0.0hello all,i am excited to be running for csm this year. it's my first run for csm, so i will include my main goals and some background info in the post below.there are multiple candidates from around provi running this year and i would definitely recommend to also vote jin back in. but if it is your alliance candidate first, consider gecko hareka second... ;)media for the impatientpodcast english (talking in stations):"
2/12/2017,"i voted for you last year, and might do it again this year if i can stop crying over that sad fate.other than that, thanks for the good work on the wardecs. there was a guy from rff last year who also wanted to make wardecs fun, in last year's candidates. don't know what he's become, but if you get in touch maybe you can bounce ideas with him.good luck, even though... fcon... seriously? right, good luck anyway."
2/12/2017,"appreciate the support! i actually have him on my buddy list already from last year - i was already planning on dropping him a line to go over his thoughts about contracts which kinda tied into my desire for a services hub, but i'll be sure to talk about him about that too. sorry about your feelings about fcon, if it makes you feel any better i'm more actively playing in my highsec corp learning how to fc a band of bloodthirsty newbros."

2/12/2017,"been in and out of templis over the years scylus has been a great leader throughout it all with a level head (which was rare for caldari militia) even when the going got tough against impossible odds (such as when galmil kicked everyone out of the warzone on multiple occasions), scylus worked to overcome those odds many leadership types in caldari militia over my 7 year tenure as a blackrise/fw resident have simply quit, made excuses or even try to pass the blame to others instead of this behavior, scylus asks ""how can we do better?"" and empowers everyone to strive towards doing just that even when almost all caldari corps/alliances have left templis remained due to scylus's leadership (lowsec for life!), which is why templis is one of the longest standing caldari fw alliances never have i witnessesd or even heard of scylus behaving in an unprofessional manner, even behind closed doors all of this is a strong indication of his good character you won't find a more professional, experienced, level headed lowsec candidate capable of hearing all sides to a discussion and making informed, balanced decisions scylus would be an extremely valuable asset to the csm i fully endorse this candidate"
2/12/2017,"scylus has the steady but light touch evidenced by him steering templis calsf (calsf) and caldari colonial defence ministry (ccdm) through rough waters though a complete rebuild, its evolution over time which has resulted in caldari militias longest lasting force resulting in the lowsec apex force that is templis calsf today he will have value with his unique input gained from the peaks and troughs of militia and lowsec life a vote for scylus is the surest bet one can make"
2/12/2017,"i have podcasts coming up i will post that information here i am interested in receiving mail about their concerns and needs i don't profess to have all the answers i truly look at myself as a representative to convey their thoughts to ccp in a respectful, professional manneri come from a world where partnership and working as a team generates the answers needed to a problem or opportunity you know the saying ""win as a team""best,scylus former executor templis calsf alliance"
2/12/2017,"i've only been in templis for about 2 years so i haven't known scylus as long as others but i can attest to his near unnatural ability to speak to and for his pilotsscylus is quite literally a shining beacon in the darkness of space - he gives his undivided attention to the topic at hand, offers advice when asked, and goes above and beyond to help those around him his diplomatic prowess is second to none and he is always courteous as an active participant in fw for many years and under many hats, he has seen what works, what doesn't, and what would improve fw and low-sec as a wholei proudly endorse him"
2/12/2017,"i will be voting for the judge, you should too."
2/12/2017,confirming this entire post is pretty much spot on in regards to current bs meta. i particularly agree with the sensor strength / scan res / targeting range on bs's needing buffs and so glad to see you have picked up on that. something i have requested myself in previous threads. you have my vote on that platform alone.if only people had warned larrikin that 37.5km scramming hics would dominate the small gang meta and kill a lot of viable bc and bs options before they were announced over a year ago.......

2/12/2017,"may i present the following suggestion (also linked in my sig) as a simple and easily implementable solution to the binary and un-fun nature of ecm in eve. there is quite a bit of math, but the concept is relatively straight forward without having to read all the maths involved."
2/12/2017,me too
2/12/2017,"given your own aptitude and interest in balance as a candidate on the csm, do you feel there are any other candidates who you feel serve the same areas or would compliment your efforts on the csm? mrhyde last year had a large amount of his vote go to exhausted (i.e not counted) after he was elected, and i feel that csm 12 could do more with the raw mechanical knowledge that he and gorski provided in csm 11."
2/12/2017,"this is a good question. another question suitonia, have you any thoughts on how to improve faction warfare? and if so, what are your thoughts on that subject?"
2/12/2017,"no vote for me. everytime i engage this dude, all he does is trash fellow eve players (me and others) who leverage the game mechanics. someone who disparages existing mechanics to the point that he does is dangerous on csm. i have a feeling he'd ban all drugs, all implants, and the ability to receive reps (after all, tough to solo if you run into ""cancer"" who flies with implants, drugs, and dudes who may rep you)."

2/12/2017,"hello to eve players.as some of you may know, it is that time of the year again where we elect members of the csm. this year i am asking you to vote for me, even if it is second or third on your preference lists.my pasti started playing eve in mid 2014 and for about a year all my time was spent there trying to find stuff to do and losing ships all the time. since then i have run an alliance that fell apart, moved to provi and joined many pvp groups and recently started to fc fleets.who i amlow and null small gang pvp'er.pvp in large providence fleets.provi fc for 20-40 man fleets. (usually talwars and small stuff)occasional streaming on twitch.someone who stands up for the little guys, but doesn't ignore the bigger ones.my campaigni would like to see more emphasis on qol changes to make life easier for the people who come on to have fun and enjoy themselves. ccp have recently revealed some amazing changes that make life easier for people and i would push to continue that trend. it wouldn't need to be major dev-time put towards some of the fixes but they could improve peoples play massively.the lore is another place i would love for some improvement. it was going very well until recently where it seems to have stagnated and a lot of people i speak to would like more frequency. i would want to see more frequent news articles that lead up to in game events that are fun for all involved. it may be necessary to bring in major names from the rp community in order to help accomplish this however i would love to see a more vibrant world around us.i will represent the players as csm is supposed to do, i'm not going to take the view of one player as less than that of someone else just because they come from and area of space or alliance that is viewed unfavourably by people.one thing is that i will be open and honest as far as possible without breaking nda, if there is something i don't agree with then i'll push for us to get a community opinion on it.after all of that, i am open to suggestions from other people and i am more than willing to take on their feedback and do the best that i can to raise the issue and get a response from ccp on those topics. me not having experience is not a bad thing, it means i am going to be less biased to a certain playstyle.contact details - mail me in game - bardghost isudiscord - bardghost isu #4079twitter - @bardghost_isureddit - bardghost_isuthank you all for readingfly safe and remember to vote."

2/12/2017,"i cannot vouch for sullen's efficacy as a csm member enough. he has been a consistent hard worker, running discussions with industrialists on capital industrials from before we even knew they were going to be re-balanced as he saw problems with them and wanted a head-start on it. he's always been approachable, reasoned, and willing to converse on any point. i will be putting him high on my own ballot, and would recommend that you do as well."
2/12/2017,"i will be voting for sullen, you should too."

2/12/2017,"there will be an interview with the guys from the new german podcast evepodcast.de. if you have any questions regarding my candidacy and are a german player make you sure you poke them on twitter @evepodcast_de(sorry for messing up the sentence in the first place. doing too much at once)heute abend werde ich von den jungs vom deutschen podcast evepodcast.de interviewt. sollte ihr fragen an mich bzgl. meiner kandidatur haben, lasst es die jungs unter @evepodcast_de auf twitter wissen."
2/12/2017,kalbuir already is an ambassador for this game with all the work he puts in for newbeans in horde.i strongly believe him being able to directly communicate with ccp via the csm platform would benefit both ccp and new players as a whole and there's no doubt about his dedication.this is a vote i can comfortably say will not be wasted.
2/12/2017,"classification: unclass//fouoto: all pilotssubject: i started eve long ago in january 2004, shortly after my 24th birthday, and have been playing ever since. i have ~40 accounts with over 80 characters, have much experience in many aspects of eve and have experienced everything the game has to offer at least twice (except being on the csm). becoming csm member will allow me to assist all of you in making this game even better. i have ran a 1 man (40 alt) corp for both industry & pvp with much success (before they made isboxer illegal). i have been heavily involved in alliance leadership (several years in the past). i have commanded dozens of fleets (once upon a time long ago). however, i mostly prefer manufacturing, mining, and trading (ie making isk trillions). don't get me wrong i like blowing stuff up too, but usually its my stuff that seems to do all the exploding. if elected, i hope to be able to contribute more to eve on the behalf of you (the ignored and misunderstood capsuleers) than i ever could before. trust me or not, vote or don't vote, but if you want a voice that will not be ignored, then i am your candidate!thanks in advance for all your support (or constructive criticism).v/r,frezinviperclassification: unclass//fouo"

2/12/2017,"dear all,i would like to announce my candidacy for csm 12.i hope that as someone new to the csm i can bring fresh perspective and insight, that perhaps is lacking when the same faces are re-elected year after year, which i believe to be platitudinous.i<U+FFFD>ve been playing eve since the winter of 2013 where i first began as a humble high sec miner. i soon however began broadcasting on eve radio in the summer of 2014.whilst at eve radio, i<U+FFFD>ve taken part in a number of community endeavours including pvp tournaments as well as major giveaways and the regular eve radio mining op.more recently, i<U+FFFD>ve taken the leading role in recruitment for eve radio where i have moulded and developed various djs into the broadcasters and entertainers that they are today. as such, i feel i can take some of the credit and or blame for the success of the station.i have also been an active member of the eve community outside of game; being an original regular attendee of eve_nt, where i have had the privilege to interview various ccp devs as well as players of significant standing in the eve community. i am proud of the fact that i appear at the start of the eve_nt promotional video.as a lawful evil personality, i consider community service in a leadership role such as this to be a high honour and i am a strong advocate for the harsher side of eve which we all know and love to hate.as such i seek to represent the humble low sec pirate and militia member.i<U+FFFD>ve decided to run under my eve radio persona in order to comply with ccp<U+FFFD>s rules regarding alts, however, my main has until recently been an active combatant in faction warfare ex parte minmatar militia. i would like to work with ccp to develop this aspect of the game, one which has generated a great deal of passion both from myself and others across the warzones admittedly an area of the game which has kept me interested due to its nature.i feel that even after the tireless work of sugar kyle on the csm, low sec remains an unattractive area for capsuleers, especially outside of faction warfare. with players either remaining in high sec or being shuffled to null sec almost as soon as they receive their first pods, as a result, large swathes of low sec remain barren wastelands especially with the introduction of jump fatigue.i would like to see low sec being an area worth fighting over, with penalties and bonuses for being active in the area and not simply be condemned by the thuggery of the highwayman.the recent events that have been run, such as operation frostline and purity of the throne were available in low sec, but there was no added incentive to run these sites there with the additional risk that comes from being in low, which ironically meant that it was far easier to find and run these sites uninterrupted in low sec space, at least in my experience.personally i was a fan of these events, even if i wasn<U+FFFD>t able to take part in them as much as i would have liked and i feel that there should be more of them run, both from a lore perspective and from a player retention standpoint as they were quite appealing to the casual player, which i believe is rapidly becoming the standard for mmos.additionally, i enjoyed the coronation of catiz i and would love for more of these events to take place. when the state visit of malteau shakor was announced, i feel that a gameplay element was missed whereby amarrian<U+FFFD>s could have attempted his assassination with minmatar loyalists defending him. i am still waiting with baited breath to find out the real reasoning behind that visit.on that note, i would love to see the events of faction warfare affect gameplay in high sec and the wider new eden. for example station services such as repairs or jump clones could be more expensive in amarr space when minmatar have control of the warzone perhaps as the result of a slave rebellion or perhaps certain minmatar items could not be sold in amarr space as part of a trade embargo.i would also like to see changes to citadel mechanics whereby neutral or enemy citadels cannot simply be anchored in a system held by an occupying militia. on balance, i would like to see the vastly underrated mechanic of reduced market fees for orders placed in certain fw systems. i would like to see this mechanic iterated to provide an incentive for industrialists to conduct their operations in low security space as such i would seek to encourage pirate trade hubs that enable spaceship violence to continue especially for those with low security standing.and finally, one of the most complained about modules in the game, the warp core stabilizer. whilst there are many campaigns to remove this module from the game, i however would like to see an introduction of additional escape modules such as this, possibly in the officer or deadspace varieties.i say this, not because i don<U+FFFD>t know the pain of persons escaping me being stabbed, particularly in fw plexes, but because i feel that it must be possible to choose the terms of your engagement and where necessary make a hasty retreat. thus allowing your underlings a greater share of the <U+FFFD>honour<U+FFFD> of battle for nothing is sweeter than the tears of the enemy you have denied a kill.if you<U+FFFD>d like to contact me to discuss ideas and my application you can find my details below:in game: dj-thomastwitter: @djthomasgrnemail: thomas@eve-radio.comirc: irc.theairlock.net @thomas on #eve-radio"

2/12/2017,"lowsec does indeed need some drastic incentives to get more pilots out to low looking for a fight.fw changes would be cool along with something like ""solo systems"", in which you can only use a jump gate every 5 minutes."
2/12/2017,"sorry, allow me to clarify. when i say ""incursion rats"", i'm talking about the npcs that spawn outside of combat sites. i think adding solo content to incursions would encourage more players to move around new eden following incursions, and allow players who don't want to/can't participate in incursion fleets to experience a flavorful, lore-rich game experience.my idea for tags isn't geared toward making people more richer, but rather to make it easier to complete datacenter missions, raise standings, and purchase items from lp stores. i ran missions exclusively for amarr corporations for almost a year, and even after keeping all of the tags i received from those missions, i still do not have enough of the requisite tags to purchase anything from corporate lp stores. i think individual players should be able to gather enough tags to make lp store purchases over the course of normal gameplay, without having to focus specifically on gathering tags.also, thank you for the kind words about the uniwiki! i truly enjoy working on it, and it feels good to hear that people appreciate the work that we do!"
2/12/2017,"i think it depends on who the defender is, really. i would say that in almost all cases the defender doesn't have fun when they are being killed and forced to use neutral haulers and whatnot when traveling through a pipe or going to a hub.why would any corporation want to opt-in for wars, other than mercenary groups and whatnot? you will have literally almost all of highsec immune to wardecs, and that's not good.that wouldn't change much to be honest. this would just push groups to have multiple alliances and maintain different wars on each. fill each alliance with multiple corps for you to hop between, and you can have all the fun you want and not worry about being limited by the number of wars any single alliance can have."
2/12/2017,"it's clear that wardecs need fixing, and that there are a ton of different suggested ways of fixing them. i don't claim to have all the answers, and honestly finding a solution to wardecs is beyond the capability of one person. that said, i'm committed to fixing wardecs so that they're acceptable to the entire community."
2/12/2017,"i'm interested in finding out exactly what the entire community considers, ""acceptable"". lots of really bad ideas and uninformed opinions here and on reddit."
2/12/2017,"npe is prolly one of the best things that happened to new eden since isogen 5. it's really nice to hear about someone wishing to help ccp on ""new player experience and other (in-game) tutorial content"".i'm also glad to read that at least someone realized that having lost the igb made quite a lot of public & non-public documentation and tutorials used by new players far less valuable than they used to be. i'd gladly read a whole lot more of your ideas on these subjects. quite a few documentation projects, like fits collections, missions helps, etc remain in limbo since. even if we all know that esi is the future (and a really nice thing i do love to play with), nothing tells us atm if the information that was made available in-game to the igb will be on the long run available via esi : quite a lot already is, but should we except commitment for some reasonable time ?however, since neither the csm nor ccp prolly doesn't give even one tenth of a **** on these subjects, why do you believe that getting elected would change anything to that ? or are you just campaigning to try to raise awareness from the usual csm lobbyists hoping to have some of them getting a few clues about the expectations of the playerbase ? wardecs are, of course, a very important subject for newcomers. but you prolly know from the publicly-available notes that neither csm x nor ccp had even half a clue on the problem they created with this half-baked shower-thought scheme. and since quite some time passed since that mistake, quite a lot of players adapted to the problem and some even managed to get fun from it. of course, players having chosen to play with new players also adapted, mostly at ccp's expense for having created the problem, and just use the problem as it is to help people beginning into eve get what makes eve different from most games in the industry. so, why do you believe that getting elected may help to improve the situation, however mediocre it is, which can be adapted to (mostly at ccp's expense) ?"
2/12/2017,"making war opt-in only would be terrible idea. if it's just a straight opt-in approach pos'es poco's and citadels would be untouchable. even you had to opt-in to have a citadel or something of that nature incursion players and every other player who wants 0% tax would use it. you would basically reduce highsec pvp down to suicide ganking and station gaming. if want wardecs to be better for all, teaching new players what it means to make a corp, and what can happen when you do, is a start. also giving highsec corps better benefits to staying incorp and not leaving as soon as a dec drops. i fully believe one of highsec biggest problems is the ignorance of newbro's (not their fault) when it comes to eve. npe is a huge issue when it comes to eve-online and even though ccp is make bounds and leaps with it recently, there is still a ton of work that needs to be done concerning it. you still need someone to basically guide a new player by the hand so they understand that eve is meant to be unforgiving in it's nature. also have the tutorials stop giving shield and armor reps to players at the same time. seriously that's why we see so many people trying to dual tank, it's because the game indirectly encourages by giving new players both an armor rep and a shield booster at the same time.#deletetheweak"
2/12/2017,"thank you so much for your reply!i'm not sure i entirely agree with your assessment. when reading the latest csm minutes, i noticed quite a few mentions of new players from csm members (that did seem to be brushed off by ccp staff, i'll admit). i think that there are csm members who are aware of the importance of making eve more accessible to new players, and that they may be willing to speak up a bit more with someone on the csm who has that as their #1 priority.i am sincerely campaigning to be elected, not just to raise awareness. the first step of getting the csm and ccp to care about an issue is to actually elect someone to the csm for whom that issue is paramount. i don't expect to just waltz in on day 1 and miraculously show everyone the error of their ways, but if i raise the same issue consistently, logically, and relentlessly, i'm confident that i can bring some people around."

2/12/2017,when this man posted in dodixie local i knew this was a guy that could get **** done. vote for this man. make the council great again!
2/12/2017,this is a guy who has been around the block long enough to know the ups and downs the community has seen.definitely someone you want representing the player body to the developers!make new eden great again!he gets my thumbs up for sure.
2/12/2017,"i was skeptical at first but considering how long people have been saying this it must be true, like if it was a scam ccp would have shut it down 10 years ago right?i say get behind eletherus and support local chat begging, it is after all what makes eve great*update - i was paid 100 isk for this post"
2/12/2017,"having closely studied this guys campaign, i have to say that he gets my vote. he has rafts of measures that could really revitalize this game. i definitely think that if you want a candidate who will try their best to keep eve fresh then eletherus is the guy for you.make new eden great again!"
2/12/2017,"dear capsuleers,this year again i wish to get in the csm, so we need you.stop the bad campaign hereif, like me, you are a bad pvper, you do not care about the alliances, the politics and the dramas. like me, you think pi, fw, trading, ganking is soooo boring and you do not have an isk to pay you big ships:simply vote for me!this is my program for csm xii. i will update it regularly, your ideas are welcome !- first of all, we want only 1 guy in the csm, not 14 or 10 ! this guy will be chosen by myself and renewable eternally. in case of death his son will continue at the head of the csm. for the first year, only one candidate will be eligible for the position: me- we want roundabouts and crossroads lights to streamline traffic at the dedock of major commercial hubs such as jita. this will avoid ships bumps and so many accidents.- every 2 hours of flying a ship, a forced rest will be imposed. this, to avoid falling asleep when you are driving and create an accident. with this system, you won't blow up yourself on a gate because afk.- we want also implementation of radars between 2 gates, with imposed speed limitations. 5au / s max for distances within 30au between 2 gates. each offender will receive a fine of 10m isk => less space accidents- if titans or supercaps are present in a system, red and green lights will be activated on the gates to make the traffic more fluid. 20 ships maximum at the same time in one system. -> tidi is over!- any corporation taxing more than 5% will have to justify how they use the money. a commission of players elected inside the corporation will keep an eye on this.- for roamers, we want green and red lights on each gate ! how deaf people can hear the orders ""gate is green"" or ""gate is red"" from their fc?? so they jump when the gate is red, and they die in the next system.... shame- at least 1 free skin / ship. why only minmatar ships should be beautiful in this game ? other races should be nice also- we will work to make concord as bad shooters as the stormtroopers, in order to maximize the chances of the pirates to escape safely.- the end of cynos with 20 ships that jump in 1 time, now, the ships will jump one after the other, with a delay of 10 seconds. farmers will have more time to warp out.vote for a new hope, vote borat !"

2/13/2017,"he explains it at the end of the other thread: it means he feels ccp has moved he goal posts for the csm - again - and they are no longer interested in having all gameplays, particularly his own, represented.as such, this represents borat's ragequitting from the csm race."
2/14/2017,"i don't seem to able to find the graphs. i just see underlined ""links"" i can't click."
2/14/2017,"i had hoped the overhaul of the npc mission system was farther along than these exploratory questions suggest. it's desperately needed.on the first question, i don't think pve needs to be harder overall. some small, newly authored, randomly selected goals inside of a mission could keep the overall difficulty (if measured in damage and hitpoints) the same, while providing new choices we haven't seen before. for example, one time you're asked to rescue the damsel just like it is today, from a structure with the usual defenders. another time, zor undocks as you approach or start shooting the structure, takes the damsel and microjumps (one time only) 100km away: forget the structure, you've got to stop zor. on the second question, i think new players should be able to get into most level 4's during their second month; a sense of progression and ability is important for retention; every month a new player has to decide if its worth it to keep paying. the burner missions provide great info up front so a player can make an informed choice about the (intense) difficulty, its a good template to follow for the most difficult content to help avoid morale-crushing losses. the other level 1-4 mission texts aren't nearly as helpful; most players are recommended to consult external mission reports. marauders were overhauled (bastion mode) with the realization that level 4's were too grindy, and here's the ship class players should aspire to fly, for best isk/hr."

2/14/2017,"aryth brought up the topic of shield capitals and how there are issues with being extremely vulnerable to energy neutralizers. ccp said they would revisit it after releasing shield slaves. ccp said that they were also aware of application issues with caldari weapon capitals. edit: sorry, missed it when i read through the first time and didnt come up under missiles <3 - any kind of roadmap on this?bobmon brought up the topic of capital ship movement via tethered structures. ccp responded that they're not happy with the current system, but it was again a matter of priorities compared to other work they needed to do.fairly disappointed in this response in all honesty, i'd like to see dev work go into making sure feature and content work and are balanced before deciding they're ""good enough"" and wandering away. i understand the reasoning, but it's pretty darn overpowered at the moment."
2/14/2017,"wut kind of nonsense is this...the ability to cope with real-life eye strain and/or have more displayed at once because of monitor resolutions don't make a player good. the overview ui in a fleet fight, particularly small gang, is like trying to read a financial spreadsheet where the rows and values keep on changing order.give us the multi overview.in fact, give us multi-multi overview... i know that i would straight away create 3 for logistics purposes... my fleet, enemy fleet, my logi.in b4 100-rorqual hot-drops that can mine the entire asteroid belt in seconds so there's no roids nearby to allow panic to be activated."

2/14/2017,"because eve pve is not intrinsically fun. if it were, more people might look for it to be."

2/14/2017,"first.noobman is hands down the most active and approachable wormhole member of the csm i have ever had the pleasure to know and fly with. i would say he is one of the most accessible csm's ever. if you have ideas and want your voice heard by a knowledgeable and experienced pilot who understands eve, he is a candidate you should highly consider."
2/14/2017,"noobman, i've heard from braxus that he doesn't feel comfortable around you. something about playground bullies, could you elaborate?"
2/14/2017,he has my votes.

2/14/2017,"i've had the complete spectrum of csm representatives in my eve experience. on one end, i was in nulli secunda so i know what a complete reject you can get with a representative like gorga. on the opposite end of that spectrum is noobman, who has been the best representative for my eve experience to the csm to date.one of the most important things is that he is still passionate about the game. he continues to find challenges and goals that drive him. his motivation for working as a member of the csm is clearly to improve the game experience for all of us. he is not a block vote getting in to boost his ego and get a free trip. he is the opposite, he is there for us, for wormholers, and he listens to everyone. the most clear examples of how well he represents us are his town hall meetings and how those translate directly to the message he delivers to ccp as recorded in the csm minutes. everything from fax balance in wh's without impacting nullsec all the way to mining ore or npc spawn ranges in low class wormholes are on the agenda. he is easily approachable and good feedback and ideas presented to him will make it to the csm and ccp.his expertise, experience, and energy make him the best wh candidate for eve. he's got all of my votes. good luck noobman."
2/14/2017,thank you for all you've done so far. you have my votes for csm xii :d

2/14/2017,"thanks for the feedback, at the very least, connecting all the warzones into a circuit would helpcontributer to eve is easy:"
2/14/2017,"greetings, capsuleer! or as the old intro used to say dare to be bold! so here<U+FFFD>s my being bold.i am a member of brotherhood of spacers, a sov-null alliance currently holding space in perrigen falls. while a member of an alliance, i am not being a candidate for this alliance only, although my focus might be weighted towards 0.0 as it is the area of the game i am most familiar with.i am a candidate for you the players: the real strength of eve online.through my years of playing this game, i have really come to realise that the primary strength of this game is the social structures that exist within the game. i<U+FFFD>m not necessarily speaking of alliance or corps, but also of communities like the incursion communities, groups like bombers<U+FFFD> bar, spectre fleet, or channels like broadcast for reps.i would love for those community aspects to be strengthened even perhaps through in-games means, perhaps ui/ux-wise.my second point is that this great game needs to remain dynamic. while groups can start a chain of events that lead to great content like the recent tribute war, i feel that ccp could help motivate this kind of change. i will not claim that i have any ready-made answer as to how ccp could help the ball moving, but i will gladly participate with my input of whatever changes ccp might present to the csm.as your csm, i will strive to be your voice. while i do not keep a blog, or host a podcast, i am an ever present part of my alliance<U+FFFD>s online and offline presence. my alliance mates, and people beyond the confines of my blues, know that they can count on me when the need arises. -*-*-*-*-i have played eve since november 2012 when i created my first character. less than a day in the trial, i chose to subscribe as i found the scenery beautiful. after spending some time in my newbro days in a small corp, i went my own ways towards highsec missioning in my solo corp. while i didn<U+FFFD>t take part in massive fights, i followed the eve metagame on twitter, reddit, and through forums and blogs. i am an active member of #tweetfleet and will gladly partake in any discussion about the future of the game (hence my candidacy).following the 2014 <U+FFFD>this is eve<U+FFFD> trailer, i decided to shed my hs hem and join with brave newbies inc. where i learnt so much. i have forged some of my strongest friendships with the people with whom i have shared space, corp, and comms.i am currently fulfilling some non-critical roles in my alliance. i have worked with recruitment, diplo, and some light small gang fc<U+FFFD>ing. i think that being a csm would not impact my current roles.in my real life, i work for the main library of copenhagen in the logistics dept. my work hours allow me to dedicate most of my free time to eve.-*-*-*-*-finally, i<U+FFFD>m always available on twitter @minustar or in game. i pride myself in answering every eve-mail i should receive. if you have any questions, feel free to contact me.and with that,fly safe, dangerously, or however you like.o7 stellan c."
2/14/2017,"and here's an itemised list of what things i would like to see implemented by ccp together with the csm. game mechanics should encourage dynamic pvp and pve play styles. add an option to share character information when applying to a corp. (e.g. mails, wallet, assets, etc.) every mechanic should have a counter play. system security should change depending on the activity. the more ratting is done, higher sec. more pvp, lower sec. system security band shouldn't change and should remain tied to the static base security status. third party kill boards are great, but there should be an in-game ability to search killmails one has participated in. the market window should allow camelcase and word search. ""scourge missile"" should return all scourge missiles (rockets, light, heavy, assault, cruise, etc.) the drone ui needs a revamp. drone health bars should update while tethered and repairing. proper beards and long hair for male characters. the new eden system should have a memorial to lost friends. right-clicking on a corpse should have a ""show character info"" option. contracts need to show which corpses are being contracted. an esi endpoint to collect character sheet notes. hovering over the ig clock should also display the local time according to the pc settings. communications officers should be able to send ig notification pop-ups."

2/14/2017,bumping in support for thomas. he is definitely another candidate that has shown excellent leadership and communication skills on eve radio and beyond.
2/14/2017,"hello.i really liked the thread.the information and critics are pretty accurate.i am fairly a new player to eve.but i am fairly an old timer when net gaming is the subject. i always read about games and their background-storyline and always interested in roleplaying.about eve,storyline,pve and pvp.i support your ideas.i also think all three sides of eve gameplay should not be seperated form eachother but should be brought together.originally,pvp meant to be roleplaying aswell.people pvp to roleplay the dread knight, hunting innocent prey or the knight of valor,defending the lives and the honor of the realm and justice.spoils of war meant to be the natural result of the skirmishes.according to the rules based on the in game scenario there shall be natural punishment for whom that breaks the law.(non pirate amarr bounty hunters keep a track of an amarr pirate player and hunt him down whenever he kills an amarrian citizen...or the similar for other factions etc...same players cant run pirates and bounty hunters to milk the game mechanics.this is pvp with rules.pvp with roleplay.pvp with results.not only scoreboards.alas,pvp part at most sandbox mmo games i played untill now were simply this : some bully gamers who log in drunk or high (or have some kind of psychologic issue) randomly attack anyone on sight to harass and speak their hate words...i say sadly because as i stated above,pvp meant to be a part of roleplay.pvp should never meant to be a gifted tool to be the annoying bully who cause newbs and veteran players to get sick and tired and leave any mmo.opposite of this is bad for gamers;awfull for the gaming companies.the reason behind this is not eve developers.they meant to create a space fantasy that people could run their own dungeon mastery and roll their own dices and let other players play free....and that is the hot spot there.when anyone who owns the biggest treasury or the strongest weapon out there wants to be a dungeon master ; and if any sort of strictly set- in game rules or written scenarious do not exist...that dungeon master can do anything to anyone and anywhere...can also get over with anytihng ,saying 'who cares i made up a new rule right now...door is there if you dont like it'but check this,the dungeon master is the narrator and rolls the dice or lets other players roll and keep up with the story.dungeon masters are not there to ruin the day,delibarety, for the dungeon runners,just becasue they feel bad that day.i hope it is clear up to now.the strong pvper,the corporation manager or a random pver or a roleplayer are meant to be all equal even if they dont have the same rights on their own property.if eve meants to be a sci-fi scripted game with pvp and higly social interaction;and not only an ordinary space arena; first person shooter game...then it needs some rework about player interaction,corporation roles and how players behave in and out the pvp situations.this includes roleplay and reasoning when player killing aswell.with respect to the original idea that creators of this game intend to shape.bringing eve or any other sandbox out there to a better place...solution is hidden there at sticking to the orignal scenario script and making anyone following in game rules.be it strict,be it loose."
2/14/2017,"years ago we were promised to walk in station.i dream of others seeing my clothing in station or sitting down and playing card or other games in station. this was killed when burn jita happen, a vocal group was able to stop the development of this part of the game.i still want to walk in station.and would like to talk to and work with ccp to explore completing content, and allowing a new types of game play, including station related game play."
2/14/2017,"you can, but the chance of it happening is pretty low as its not on the road maps. csm are not mini-developers. i would love it being completed as well, but there's a lot more important that's on the table than captains quarters."
2/14/2017,"while i agree with you there are things that may be important as well, they've actually started this and had a reasonable amount of it worked out and done. i would assume opening the station door at this point is not insurmountable and would be relatively easier than for example making dust 514"
2/14/2017,"the csm doesn't get to set ccp's development priorities. and one feature which may have no work done on it (i'm being very very generous with that ""may"") is a very weak platform to run on. at the very least, let people know what you do, and what you know."
2/14/2017,"i'm glad you put so much detail into your candidacy post. but yeah, i doubt it'll happen and it's such a niche concept to run for csm on... good luck."

2/14/2017,lets examine what we can know or say about the character of eletherus.you can always just a person's truthfulness by the twitch that their mouth makes when they speak.clearly eletherus can tell no lies.just recite the motto that is his name.everylittleeffortthatheavenexpectsredefinesussatisfactoryhis eye gaze downward is not in pity for the futile struggles of man beneath him.he can't help that he is tall.he looks down so that he may meet the gaze of every person he meets.clearly eletherus is humble.
2/14/2017,"i honor the man who has honor. it is hard to find someone who has honor in a game that encourages scamming, what else do you look for in a man with as such qualities. just as treasures are uncovered from the earth, so virtue appears from good deeds, and wisdom appears from a pure and peaceful mind. to walk safely through the maze of human life, one needs the light of wisdom and the guidance of virtue, the guidance of the man, the guidance of eletherus."

2/14/2017,honesty is what i look for in a candidate. and i can tell you eletherus was honest with me when he didn't have to be. he has also been around a while and know what we need. i vote eletherus for csm

2/15/2017,"the more ppl will do pve the more pvp targets you will have. i'm more concerned about all this npe thing. it seems to not accomplish anything spectacular yet. after initial boom pcu is dropping, but hey new skins everywhere..."
2/15/2017,"good npe is important, i didn't try the current version yet, so can't judge about.my comment above was about that ccp has to put theme park like resources in making pve intrinsically fun, including new content, stories every patch... also people are lazy, if the reward does not scale with the effort/risk, people will just do it in secure space for fun or don't do it at all because other stuff gives more isk/h. hence scaling the risk and complexity (aka ""fun""), requires to scale the reward as well, which leads to balancing issues. see the new clever mining npcs, only few bother, the reward does not justify the effort and risk. the drifter incursions are a second example, first people found clever strategies and the reward was too high, and when it was cut back, nobody bothered to run them anymore."
2/15/2017,"question is what is good npe?we don't need new npc ai. i've wondering what is the purpose for those new mining fleets. we can interact with only by shooting them. what the point here? so miner gankers have more fun? it has nothing to do with improving any pve experience, apart from i can see the fleets on my d-scan sometimes. we need something more than ""warp to site, shoot trigger, loot, warp off"". after 15 sites most of pve players will uninstall. where is the fun? in unpredictability. in difficulty. i've done all kind of noncombat exploration sites, all types of 1-4 ded sites, most of unrated complexes. loot table is good (most of it), but they are all the same. this is no game for pve oriented players. they will be bored too quickly."
2/15/2017,"but why do you do pve? what is your motivation? would you still do it, when it's more exciting, but without any valuable reward for the time spent?"
2/15/2017,"even in high-security space people doing pve provide targets for someone (read: mtu killers/baiters, mission item stealers, suicide killers of blinged ships, etc...).not sure if it is a problem though. look at burner missions. the problem as i see it: ccp cannot find sweet-spot (or they do not want to).they either make stupid ai low-reward npcs (look at recent event) or totally overpowered npcs with big rewards (burners, i'm looking at you!). as result such things are not popular among 'casuals'. i believe exploration is a perfect example of properly done pve. it is totally pve but to find it people go for low-sec and 0.0-space and even wormholes providing pvp."
2/15/2017,"yes, it's nice, but i would not call it pve as it has more pvp elements, and exploration is isk neutral. other than rat bounties, mission / incursion payouts, which are faucets.but also here you see clearly that not many do it just for fun ... only few bother with data sites, why? because the reward is bad."
2/15/2017,"why do we play games? to be bored? it's doesn't matter how high reward would be if game become second job. if i'm willing to spent part of my free time to the game i want its mechanism to be entertaining. exploration is all about rewards ofc, thats why we ""exploring"", to find some good stuff. pi is good example, it may bring a lot of reward (isk) but did you ever do it? i manage to do it for a week. then i throw up and went back to exploration. edit: second good example are events. i do them for the rewards (booster mostly). do i enjoy them? no, because they are boring."

2/15/2017,"faction warfare (fw) space is one of the best arenas where older and newer players go to learn and participate in solo and small gang pvp not only those who are actual members of the militias but many many other players (neuts) and corps who visit regularly i know so many players who have alts in fw space, it is very active and (imo) one of the most fun aspects of eve online i'm surprised that there as never been a ccp fw representative and it's time there was one fw is over due at least a few tweaks, or perhaps even a complete overhaul of it's mechanics particularly with regard to the impact of the introduction of citadels and also pilot sec status problems a faction warfare representative in the council will be critical to this i can think of no better candidate than scylus black, who has the knowledge and commitment to represent fw pilots from the player perspective effectively he is widely respected and supported across all the faction militias"

2/15/2017,"eletherus has been around eve for five years so has plenty of experience needed in a csm. i say vote for him, while many players vote for the oldest players, some who've been here since inception, a fresher approach with a player who's experience is focused around the era of the biggest upheavals to eve is who we need on the next csm."

2/16/2017,"i thought eve was having trouble getting in new players because of competition with other games? i mean, there are emerging mmos now that support sandboxy elements like player driven economies and player factions. there's eso which is buy to play though it's a themepark but it is fun though. guild wars 2 is fair f2p. crowfall is buy to play (yet to be released though). albion online is another buy to play. in fact, if eve didn't go f2p i wouldn't even bother to play.my point is, i don't think that not having a risk free high sec space hinders the game from having new players. i'm freaking new myself. risk is fun in this game and drives people to form groups. playing and coordinating with others is what's fun in this game. for me at least but i think other people will agree as well. coordination with others mitigates risk. i don't think sandbox and consensual pvp mixes well together."
2/16/2017,"i do and have a nice 5 planet setup in nullsec doing r0->p2 with minimal maintenance effort.my personal challenge and fun is to come out ahead in all kind of competitive situations using only one char, which also includes getting same/more while spending significantly less effort than others. incursions are an example of an activity i tried and won't touch again ... it's tedious, attention consuming and gives not enough reward compared to what i can get by just chilling in perimeter. what i liked was the in-official challenge to get hands on the elite drone ai chips when the price spiked, so i ran a lot of missions to get as much agents as possible locked into the specific mission to farm them for a week."

2/17/2017,"so here's the deal. eve has the highest degree of character customization of any game out there. there is no other game i can think of where who you associate with and what you do so fundamentally define who you are. you can literally be whomever you want, with no restrictions. that's quasi-infinite character customization - it's part of what makes eve such a good game, and contributes greatly to its longevity - no templates to follow, no lists to complete, you are whomever you want to be.eve has a lot of notable personalities and organizations, and no shortage of enmity between them. there are so many unique ways, so many non-trivial ways, for your character to define itself both by association and action, that there really isn't a pressing need for more development time on avatar play or cosmetics, thus i really don't have an opinion on it. a finished captain's quarters probably won't change all that much - revitalizing npc null or energizing lowsec just might break some of the stagnation the game is currently facing, thus that's where my thoughts generally are, and, at least in my opinion, where the game needs the most development."
2/17/2017,"g'day!my name is viktor koraka and i am an eve online player from australia. i first started playing eve in 2005, but took a bit of a break when i joined the australian army in 2008. i came back to eve in 2012 and have been playing fairly regularly since then. (i should explain, for any of those who might be scrolling through my history, that i lost my account details from my first account so i had to create a new one when i came back.)my main gameplay experience has been focused around the market, industry, planetary interaction and highsec pve. based on my personal experience in the game i would be best suited to voice the concerns and ideas from players of the above mentioned categories, however, i would always be open to hear comments from players regarding other topics in eve. i believe that as a csm member you should be representing the concerns and ideas from the player community. as a csm member, i vow to uphold the role as a representative of the player community and will not push any agendas based on individual or single group demands. if a large majority of the player community were to bring up concerns and ideas, then of course i would represent their concerns and ideas.i have a great passion for eve online and truly believe it to be one of the best mmos in existence. although i am quite new to eve politics and don't spend much time on the forums, i am practically on eve all day long. if you have any concerns or ideas regarding market, industry, pi or highsec pve feel free to contact me in-game. i will end with a few points on what improvements i would like to see in eve to benefit the player community. improved story content for pve missions. regular special events in high sec (example; pirate invasion into jita, concord workers strike) improvements to war dec system in high sec improvements to market ui and market data. ideas for alternate power source for structures. (example; solar harvesters) ideas to make pi more interactive and less ""set up and leave it for two weeks"". ideas to have a damage radius from exploding npc structures. ideas for an interactive internal station area for players to actually walk around and see each other. ideas to reduce or prevent ships from camping in front of jita undock hanger in order to prevent larger ships being bumped. ideas to reduce or prevent player deployed structures or containers from congesting trade hub areas. please remember that the csm is put in place to convey ideas and feedback to ccp on behalf of the player community. i cannot make any promises that i can make changes happen, but i will do my best to relay information to ccp and get them to hear your voice. thank you for your time,viktor koraka"

2/17/2017,"i am carbon alabel, and this is my candidacy thread for csm xii.for those of you who have no idea who i am, i am a member of the alabaster albatross, part of sev3rance and provibloc, and this is my first time running for the csm.i started playing eve in 2013, in high sec, where i spent about a year and a half, mainly running missions along with some light industry and trading. after that, i moved to providence, where i have been building up experience with various types of activities null sec has to offer. during both my time in high sec and in null sec, i have also been spending time in wormholes, though in general i prefer the false sense of security provided by local chat and fixed gates in k-space.i am also an experienced third party developer. i<U+FFFD>ve made various bots, apps, and utilities (though not as many of them as i would like are publicly available), along with numerous contributions to the third party developer documentation, and am participating in the ongoing development of the new esi api, along with many other interested third party developers. i<U+FFFD>ve also recently started a blog, for which i<U+FFFD>ve only written one post so far, which should still give you some insight into my thought process and inform you about some upcoming changes.why am i running for csm? i know eve inside and out, i have the time for it, and trust myself to be responsible with the role should i be elected.what would i do on the csm? as every csm member should, i will provide feedback to ccp based on the issues and challenges faced by eve<U+FFFD>s community. along with that, these are my primary beliefs and interests which i will be pursuing:csm transparency: the csm is a democratically elected body, and as such the voters deserve an insight into its workings. even though recent councils have major strides with respect to their transparency, the fact remains that the csm is an opaque body by design. despite that, i feel there is still progress to be made, and that i could help make that happen.protection of information: the amount of free and accurate intel which can be collected in eve with little to no risk or effort is astounding.i believe that most forms of intel collection should require some kind of investment of resources, whether that is in form of players being active in space or infiltrating competing organizations, deployment of structures which require maintenance and are vulnerable to assault, or interaction with npcs.availability of information: eve is a sandbox, and the ingenuity of its players is responsible for a large part of what it is. however, many players, both old and new, lack awareness of eve<U+FFFD>s various game mechanics, placing them at a huge disadvantage.players should experience loss because they made a mistake or were outsmarted by someone, not because they weren<U+FFFD>t even aware that a certain game mechanic existed, and information on it wasn<U+FFFD>t available to them.third party content creators: they come in many forms. third party developers who make tools that help make some parts of eve less tedious, writers who report on in-game events and help those who aren<U+FFFD>t actively playing stay in touch with the game, tutorial makers who help educate players on both basic and more advanced forms of gameplay, and streamers who showcase what eve can be and help bring in more players.what all of them have in common is that they help make eve a better game in a way ccp couldn<U+FFFD>t manage by themselves, which is why ccp should support them as best as they can.that<U+FFFD>s it from me. thank you for reading this, and i hope you consider placing me on your ballot! if you have any questions at all, feel free to contact me.how to contact me:twitter - discord - tweetfleet slack - in-game"

2/18/2017,bump. most mediums ac's :)
2/19/2017,"in a little over a week. i have had a handful of both exciting and disappointing experiences in this game. i feel like i could go on forever, but in the interest of keeping this on track i will share just a few.i recall attempting to play this game back when i was in high school and the complexity was a turn off back then.recently noticed that alpha accounts weren't limited to time constraints, i decided to give this thing another shot. went through the tutorial and paid as much attention as my limited span allowed.kept saying. ah man this is much less complicated than i remember. (i feel this is in part due to ccp's efforts in improving the new player experience)for the first session of gameplay, i raided the rookie help channel with as many questions as i could come up with. which helped a ton!!!!after shopping around for a while, i have managed to settle into a corp who has decided to take me under their wing and provide a more immersive experience to this game. (this same corp had a member who was stalking me in a stealthed proteus while i was mining in lowsec with my venture) i decided to be brave, open up private coms with the guy. next thing i know i am a member of a small group of experienced players who have been nothing but the most valuable part of this game. is this a game? or is it a simulation of life in space?i have braved the frontiers of space and dove head first into wormholes way under equipped for the ad(venture) i was on (in)!filled my cargo hold up with my entire life and risked everything i had to move to a new home.my first highsec ganking experience being running my frigate straight into a much larger vessel spamming his smartbombs at the jump gate i was warping to.but i can tell you the exact minute i was hooked on this game.my corp invited me to go roaming with them as a bait ship. me not worried about my killsheet jumped on that opportunity immediately!!! i wanted redemption. i wanted to experience my first hunt and my first kill.so here i am... sitting in a super tanked out punisher fitted with an afterburner, a warp scrambler and some turrets which i felt would essentially do nothing. just sitting on top of an activation gate for a faction warfare site, trying to attract someone to come in.20 clicks above me and 20 clicks below me, my corp mates in fully fitted curse ships ready to pounce, completely invisible on the directional scan. the trap was set. i was anxious. i was getting bored. we moved around from site to site. system to system, just waiting for some action. a few highly experienced pilots who wanted to check the bait would show up and then disappear just as quickly as they came.well i had practiced using my dscan to pinpoint down ships in the area. low and behold i spot a jackdaw on the scan and pinpoint it down to a gala rendezvous point. he was out there farming for event skins. i let my corp members know i spotted him. they decided it would be worth it to try and take the fight. my orders were to warp in and charge him blind. try to point him down with my warp scrambler to keep him at the site, and they would come in and back me up.we align to site.... one last check. yup still there. i warp in. hit approach, burn towards him while locking onto my prey!warp scram engaged! (cmon guys lets get him!!) he locks me on, i'm taking damage, my voice on coms is getting louder and more excited (my shields at 60, 30 gone!!!) i'm thinking in my head.. cmon guys where are you! hes getting away!! ( hes speeding up! i lost my scrambler on him!) (overload your racks they tell me) i'm not guna let him get away!!! i heat em up and manage to point him down again! man that speed burst and range increase was the make it or break it of this fight i swear.but still no corp members, i have tunnel vision. not watching overlay, just hoping they are right behind me and getting in range(armor 90!!! 70!!) cmon guys!!! where are you!... then.. boom!!!! all kinds of beautiful and colorful beams are nabbing this ship right in front of me. instantly i felt an equal mixture of relief and excitement! its on!!! his cap is draining. hes slowing down to a crawl!! woo!!! there goes the drones flying right passed me! ten of them! swarm his ship and tear him apart in what felt like seconds! my first kill! yeah. it was pretty much all my corp mates, but it was my first kill in the game. you couldn't shut me up about it for the rest of the night. i felt like a giddy little schoolboy who just got a kiss from the girl he liked.and here it is! my corp mates let me keep all of the contents of his cargo hold.which i turned around and made a killing! in the market. hooked. sign me up. this game is a drug that cures my itch.so i am sure you are wondering why i am rambling on about this in the csm assembly hall.well. because i am a new player. i decided to read over the minutes of the last summit. in the posts below this one i will be citing some of the stuff they went over, and just offer my input. now i know i'm the little guy in this, and i am only one voice. but maybe just maybe i have a good idea in the bunch. maybe its new maybe its not. i haven't spent too much time here but with the new player experience being a hot topic as of late. well i'll give it a shot."
2/19/2017,"now to start this off, reading the minutes of the summit i sort of honed in on a specific member who seemed to have new players on his mind the most. xenuria.quote:xenuria: current state is a vast and moving social medium, in a better state than previously but needs work. dream change would be for the social aspect to help new players keep playing. in a game where the community is in the drivers seat. (eve being the shining star of this example)-the things i have been told, and the experiences i have had thus far seem to be polar opposites of each other,""everyone in this game is an *******, you can't trust anyone"". ""at any given time you can be killed or betrayed"".while these statements may hold an inkling of truth to them, so far i have seen and received myself, a great deal of help from veteran players. even people who have killed me out there in lowsec. have taken the time to have a conversation with me and even teach me how to be more proficient in ""flying safe"" i think in general. the community is still pretty darn helpful to newer players. even if they do teach you a harsh lesson."
2/19/2017,"quote:xenuria explained that he had guided a number of people through the npe, and that he had found with all of them that they had been overwhelmed the first time they docked and were asked to inject a skill. one thing he also pointed out was that players are not told explicitly that skills will always be training regardless of whether or not you are logged in or not. ccp paradox explained that this is something they have already fixed with the next version.-the npe did a great job initially, and yes. even with the improvements, aura does not cover many facets of your options for character development. one thing i did have to do research on was how attribute points worked. both by googling and asking other players. as far as i can recall. the tutorial says nothing about them, and very little info is scripted into the game on how they work."
2/19/2017,"quote:xenuria pointed out that one of the things that players have trouble with still is that weapons have limited ranges.-not only that! but they do nothing to explain the damage types that your weapons do, or how certain enemies can be tougher to kill using them. more on this in my personal thoughts.quote:xenuria brought up that it would be good to encourage players to complete a task that they need to do some learning on their own, so as to encourage them to start getting into the habit of searching for solutions. he pointed out that it needed to be relatively simple so that they can work it out on their own. ccp surge asked if he thought it should come before the career agents, to which xenuria replied yes. - i really like the idea of this. but off the bat the only practical type of scenario i could come up with is where an agent sends you to bring them something (lets call it the mystery box) and there are 3 different ones, only one of them being the correct answer. which could cause you to spend extra time on your mission finding the right item.-i see it as a test. maybe you could get one before you set off for your first agent missions become available, then to end each of the starting agents, the same type of scenario.quote: xenuria asked if it would be possible to pay to force a video to be played in a specific area for the purpose of psychological warfare, to which ccp replied maybe. ccp also added that keeping videos in rotation is going to have a cost in the future, and that you would add them through account management. - such an awesome idea. keep them coming! i really hope that this makes it into the game some day.quote:xenuria added that it would be good to make it so that the tasks also assess how well you completed the objective rather than did you complete the condition. ccp surge like the idea of an efficiency rating.- i really like this idea too, it seems that when i was running my missions. i was being reckless the entire time in order to get it done quickly. all i wanted was the mission speed bonus for a bigger pay out. i learned nothing about how well i was doing in a realistic perspective. i think that other factors which affect the payout, could help shape a pilot for the better.my personal thoughts and suggestions- one thing i wish i had learned earlier on in this game was about resistances. since i am limited to faction specific weaponry (being amarr its beam and pulse lasers) along with my ships resistances and modules which could help.perhaps find a way for pilots to learn about them? could be as simple as having an agent mention:""these (insert whoever your fighting here) tend to favor (insert whatever type of damage their weapons do) and the ships they favor flying are most vulnerable to (insert whatever type of damage here). i suggest you fit your ship to compensate for the parameters of this mission"" the first time i had ever seen this was on one of ccp's youtube videos talking about the gala event. i thought it might be nice for agents to offer the same kind of info sometimes, especially the lower level missions. i feel this could help pilots learn how to be more efficient and effective with the ships they fly.-for a quality of life suggestion, after learning how to use the market better. there is one thing that still ercks me everytime.when i have buy and sell orders up, and i use the ""my orders"" tab to look them up, i would love to see a colored bar on them if they are still the highest price purchase order, or the lowest price sell order. i like that i can see them in the market details clearly marked in blue. but if i have a lot of them on the market. it really is a pain to individually have to check on them to make sure i am still offering the best price.-now i know that scams are a part of this game, and the learning curve is really steep. but there is a specific item i looked up which is still in game and as far as i know, serves no purpose anymore. which are the attribute boosters from previous events which are now expired. i know very little about them so this could be a shot in the dark. but instead of them only being sold on market to swindle someone out of their money. maybe offer an option to repurpose them somehow?well i hope someone else here sees this and likes my input. thanks for allowing me to take your time."

2/19/2017,"speaking from experience, sullen is one of the hardest working members of csm xi. before last years election season i'd never talked to him before. almost immediately after our term started he had proven himself as a knowledgeable guy with a great work ethic. i don't think i could ever say enough good things about how he has presented himself on csm xi. he has without a doubt earned a second term on the csm and would be an asset for the csm, ccp and the player base. if you don't have sullen somewhere on your ballot, you're making a mistake."

2/20/2017,"good luck gecko!an idea for you - ship builder corporations logos could be on ships, or if too difficult to do on all ships, maybe some types of ships can have a builders mark of some sort. if my corporation builds a ship and we sell it and the buyer sees our logo/ticker maybe they want to contact us to get more ships...built in advertisement. <3 tasha"
2/20/2017,"with the thousands of years there is to play with as far as in-game lore goes and with what has been done already to bring that lore to the player, i do agree that there could be more added to the game in that regard for all security spaces. i also agree entirely that nrds and the idea behind providence is great for the new player experience and would like to see more than a generic plus or negative 5 or 10."
2/20/2017,"i personally would like to see boost ships put back into system wide boosting instead of on grid boosting, as it makes miners life's more harder and more expensive when trying to work in the fields and you need to spend like 10 mins trying to warp a giant boost ship out the belt before a fleet of ceptors comes and scrams you while dropping cynos for others to blow you up.the way boosts worked before was fine, i don't mind keeping the ammo charges, just would love to see boost ships back in safe spots boosting system wide, instead of forcing people to sacrifice there own mining fleets to get a personal booster as there isn't enough people around in any system to boost fleets, so lots suffer from lack of bonus ore gains, specially the people who are dedicated to indy.2nd thought... something to tackle the issue of afk cloaky campers in systems, yes they are annoying as hell to deal with, and worse when they not even there 90% time, maybe add a afk timer logout system to the game where if you dont click something in x time you get logged out, or add a module to sov holder systems where you can detect there cloaked ships, or even a tower module that decloaks ships in a entire system, so we can combat scan them down and kill them while they are afk sleeping all time, something that has bugged many players for years this situation has and no one has tackled it personally.3rd thought... maybe add some new ships to the game (not t3 combats but maybe, a new form of mining/indy ship) something that is like the current t2 ships, but can mine more like a rorqual but isn't as big as one, and slow as one, and also update the industrial ships, i mean a miasmos in null with 63k hold isn't enough and im not saying bring freighters into it, im suggesting maybe a bigger hold ship designed for ore/mineral moving for the people who mine with fleets of alts and don't like to dock ships every 5 minutes.these are just some thoughts i had lingering in my mind and thought would throw them out in a moment of just hoping maybe one day they will become a reality :)"

2/20/2017,"wishing you all the best for csm, we'll all be there championing you for the spot!i would really like to get cloaky camping looked at. we all know it's an age old mechanic, but i think it really needs to be reviewed as the game moves on. when off-grid boosting was in effect, the number one complaint was that, well, off-grid boosting is a thing. miners/indies complained that gankers/wardeccers used combat boosts from across the system, and likewise they complained that orcas/rorquals were sitting safe in pos shields/tethers with impunity. that changed in ascension, and here we are now.cloaky camping brings up a number of issues, especially in null. a single person in a cheap cloaky ship can in effect cripple activities in a system. now while there is no problem with this mechanic per se - after all, if he is there at the controls, more power to him for being able to do that.the problem is what's stopping someone logging in after dt, cloaking up, and leaving for the whole day. they are not actively playing the game, and aside from the one in a billion chance of someone decloaking them by bumping into them, they are totally immune. and they are having an effect on the system without potentially being there. now increase this to multiple pilots, and you see what i am getting at.i think cloaking should have a timed mechanic whereby a cloaked ship must do an action within a certain time limit - for example, change heading, move (not necessarily decloak). in essence, showing that the pilot is still there. if they do not, the cloaking module starts to take overheat damage, and with each time limit passed, it gets prone to failure. once it has started to take heat damage from running too long without any action, then it shuts down for x minutes.if you want to build in a lore explanation, the cloaking device starts heating up while all other ship systems are not working. without sufficient cooling on behalf of the ships systems running, the device starts to fail.i think if such a mechanic was set up, even with the time limit set to as long as an hour, it would have a big improvement on the gameplay, forcing players whose entire mechanic is to camp cloak systems to actually be at their consoles. or, if this was to be put to more detailed effect, a skill can be introduced, cloaking specialization, where you can increase your cloak timer for each level. the maximum should still not exceed one hour."
2/20/2017,"one more idea, for quality of life - and a simple one to implement.each combat ship should have an ammo bay. unlike a fleet hangar or drone bay however, this should literally just be a label, so the overall space is still combined with the normal cargo bay. but this would allow us to keep ammo & boosters in a separate area to the main cargo and not accidentally offload them when clearing out bought items, salvage if ratting etc. so it has no effect on the actual cargo capacity of the ship, as the cargo bay + ammo bay are still combined in size, but just allows us to categorise charges:* your favourite ship - ammo bay - drone bayjust a thought."
2/20/2017,here is a couple of ideas for you. 1. target management. a clear way to see who in your fleet is shooting at. so the fleet can concentrate fire or each of them can shoot at another target to make fights more efficient. 2. a way to share missions so anyone in the fleet can read the mission and objectives. also being able to warp to the mission on the agents missions list independantly. 3. fleet warping to agent mission bookmarks.hope these help you.
2/20/2017,go gecko !!bring passive mining boosts back :)))... and make items in hangaras multi split !!!my best wishes for your election

2/20/2017,"gecko, you are the nicest person and i know everyone who meets you in rl will adore you. you have been here since our early days and i know you will represent afk well. may you help to open new doors of opportunity for all and earn respect for the nrds way. even though it is the hardest (and often unsafest) way we can play, we share the fundamental belief that our values cannot be compromised, we enjoy helping those who need it, and we hold ourselves above the savages that ruin the experience for others. although evildoers may gain strength now from their many victims tears, we introduce more players every day to nrds who will work tirelessly against those who grief and scam players. i know you will listen to people<U+FFFD>s feedback with enthusiasm and help them always. from many backgrounds of diversity we are nevertheless united and from all of us may you gather the strength of ideas, wisdom, faith, and trust.to ccp -fix the bugs. slow down the changes.i would personally like to see you slow down on some of the radical changes to the game a little. it<U+FFFD>s exciting to see new additions to the game but when so many changes are introduced at one time and constantly more on top of that repeatedly it leaves even many older players feeling noobish and it<U+FFFD>s not quite as fun to relearn things you were already good at over and over. the excitement that should be like <U+FFFD>hey there<U+FFFD>s changes awesome<U+FFFD> often sounds more like <U+FFFD>ccp and all these #@$!*&% changes (grumble grumble)<U+FFFD>. people may poke their heads in because <U+FFFD>yey free alpas<U+FFFD>, but they quickly feel overwhelmed and lose attention faster than they get the interest to plex their accounts and become invested in playing again. the reason you have a much smaller active audience at any given time now than historically is because most people simply cannot keep up with the enthusiasm of your team to implement great new things and they feel left behind. save up some of the new ideas you want to add in and mix them in a little slower. there<U+FFFD>s nothing wrong with the changes, but the last few years have been increasingly excessive in how many and how close together. go back and spend some time and fix the kinks that drive us all crazy from day to day and everyone will love you for it and you<U+FFFD>ll give your inactive veteran players a chance to catch up and make full comebacks. if you feel the need to go into hero coding mode your production types will love you if you make the industry window lag a little less, but please stop changing things so much that many need to spend more time reading up on all the changes than playing the actual game.drive more industrial corporation growth. tidy up the bpo lockdown interface.if there's one thing i would like to see addressed is that the entire bpo lockdown functionality is way overdue for an overhaul. the voting process is tiresome with the way the window drop downs don't keep track of batch lockdowns. ccp please go try to lock down 100 bpo<U+FFFD>s and see how long it takes you even when you totally understand the game mechanics it<U+FFFD>s really brutal even for your die hard bpo collectors. i'm not saying to go change the formula of how many minerals each bpo needs to build something again, or to change the max me/pe again or to phase out more bpo<U+FFFD>s we all spent time researching - i'm just saying its a pain in the rear to lock bpo's down and that's why so many corps have thefts of them. if this mechanic was easier more corporations could buy more bpo's and build nicer collections to be self-sufficient. self-sufficiency means when someone plays with the market prices in game, you can build things yourself so it would have an effect on the way power alliances can drive market prices while also better enabling the ability of corporations to work together to share their assets effectively and unite efforts around stable and consistent gameplay styles. help the industrial corps to grow by making the lockdown voting be a lot tidier looking of an interface.good luck gecko!o7raelyafk executor"
2/20/2017,gecko for csm! o/if ccp could make a module that would help capsuleers fight against cloaky campers that would be great. some way that they cannot just leave the pc while staying cloaked all the time. something that would require them to be actively at the game.best of luck!you have my vote :d
2/20/2017,gecko for csm! o/i support this idea. no more afk then 10 minutes for this .... hhmmm ... people.
2/20/2017,"on grid boosting is fine, (god i know i'ma get hate)regarding 'standings list'rather than having every player/corp/alliance add members to their limited list, taking up a slot, and having this repeat across multiple players/corp/alliances, ccp should allow (example) cva to generate lists with those they deem red/orange/neut/blue/blah/blah/blah... their allies can then choose which lists to follow. overall this should cut back on how many active lists are out there and with multiple lists it could get rid of the cap on number of slots we currently have.war (or lack there of)war declarations should have a reason, not just 'because'. example: corp a declares war on corp b over 1 (or more) of the asteroid belts on a system. corp a can then attack corp b only and only if they are in said asteroid belts. if the war is over an entire system, then the cost goes up, but now corp a can attack corp b any where in the system. constellation, then region... example 2: corp a wants a phisical object, say a poco. corp a declares war over said poco, crop b can choose to end the war by surrendering the poco (corp a would then pay corp b for the poco at market value) and ending the war (after all... the war was over the poco). crop b can choose to fight over the poco, which means that within the grid of the poco, corp a and b can go at it.this would only apply to high-sec and low-sec systems, null after all is lawless."
2/20/2017,"a few simple ideas that i don't know why still haven't been done. hell, i'll fly to iceland and code it in if need be :)* allow repackaging of items in containers. since there is no properly defined hangar structure and we use containers, let us repackage stuff in there! such a massive pain to have to keep dragging things out and back in.* same goes for reprocessing & compressing ore.* allow us to drag chat tabs into any order we want. nothing worse than accidentally ripping a tab out of the chat window, and then having to rip them all out just to position back in the same spot.* chat window settings - adding an option to ""apply to all channels"", so that font size, portrait size etc are applied to all windows. * structure advertising boards - when right clicking a structure and selecting show info, there should be a panel (like the character bio), where the owner can put any text they like. this would be great to advertise what rigs/modules are in a structure, rathar than having to look at the services tab, and in case of engineering complexes, having to look in the industry tab for the system and working out what has bonuses to which items."

2/20/2017,will you be endorsed by those bee guys again this year or are you running as an independent candidate?
2/20/2017,"fair question.due to the math behind ballots and the total amount of seats being reduced to 10, i will likely only have a symbolic place on the official goon ballot. it's important for them to get their people back in so that slots on the ballot that matter are 1-3 and those slots are going to be reserved for directors and what goons call ""operators"". my position on the goon ballot if i am on it at all will not really contribute to my re-election because run-off is much lower with only 10 seats."

2/21/2017,"hiyasome more thoughts for you.1.move the x remove item to the right of ask price box in the multi sell window. instead of or as well as to the left of quantity box. so the name of item doesn't get in the way and can be clicked easier when enlarging regional average percentages to the right.2.choice to make windows as transparent as you like so you can have windows open and choose to see background or not. especially in space where it is more dangerous.3.would be good if everything you can do right clicking overlay like align to or warp fleet. could be done on the plotted route under a route on the left of the screen too.4.to be able to engage, salvage ,mine or repair using drones by right clicking on anchored target list.5.to receive a notification when industry/research jobs you are waiting for are completed.6.to be able to see fleet members shield,armour and hull hp without locking on to them. maybe hover over them. mainly for repair reasons and engagement."

2/22/2017,still open for questions/comments :)
2/22/2017,"i believe removing the refit ability for triage and all capitals in general with an aggression timer was a good idea. second, i think that lowsec in general can't be prevented from becoming bloc-dominated, but it can be hard to run huge empires by making structures that make money stay vulnerable to small entitles, like moon poses and pocos. i think eve is in a middle zone. it's easier then ever to be a new player joining the game, and it's definitely still a veteran's game. this is a fine line however."
2/22/2017,"to keep voting for steve or not (now that is the real question)so steve are you going to stand up for keeping the economic numbers (marketdata) as it is ?or are you going to let some ""goon"" with a overactive paranoia whine loud enough so ccp to takes it away or reduces the accuracy of it ?"
2/22/2017,"i have passed the arguments i've seen, for keeping the data at the current accuracy, on to ccp. in the end, it's their decision. i can try and influence it (and now have), but i can't force them."
2/22/2017,"i was wondering if you wouldn't mind answering some questions.1. you indicated you ran an alliance before moving to providence. what type of alliance did you run and why did you leave/shut it down?2. you lead small ship 20-40 man gangs. have you ever been involved in entosis warfare, and if so, what are your thoughts on the subject?3. you indicated that you will represent all players equally no matter where they come from. it sounds like most of your experience is in null sec. do you think you have enough experience to represent other areas of the game? how much experience do you have in high sec, low sec, and wormhole space?4. a lot of players, perhaps even a majority, don't realize the csm even exists. how do you plan on getting feedback from players?5. did you submit your paperwork to get on the ballot?"
2/22/2017,"1. you indicated you ran an alliance before moving to providence. what type of alliance did you run and why did you leave/shut it down?so at the time it was a mainly industrial alliance, we were branching out and doing other things. pvp was something we had started along with our trips into wormholes, if i remember right we even had a corp that had its own wormhole join us in the last few weeks of the alliance. sadly the alliance got shut down due to disagreements with one of the other main corps about getting our first citadel and the fact i was going to be raising the isk to buy an astrahus bpo but fell about a billion short the other corp then left after thinking that they were putting in all the effort as they had got build materials together, from that point on a lot of us went our separate ways. some of my corps guys folded in with them and headed off to volt, others found other homes, i came to provi and one guy is still keeping the old corp up. i would certainly say that i was inexperienced at the time, but we also found problems with the alliance management ui or therefore lack of it. we had been planning on going it, setting up roles and get everything else we needed to set up, sadly we never had at our disposal the stuff to do any of that so we were frantically trying to setup alternatives.2. you lead small ship 20-40 man gangs. have you ever been involved in entosis warfare, and if so, what are your thoughts on the subject?sadly entosis warfare is not something i have been directly involved in, i've flown in fleets with provi to help defend systems while the sov-holder does there entosis work. that said, i have seen both positive and negative attitudes to entosis warfare and i would say this is certainly one of the areas that is an example of my willingness to listen to what people have to say, i don't have great experience so i'm not going to have a bias to one side or the other.3. you indicated that you will represent all players equally no matter where they come from. it sounds like most of your experience is in null sec. do you think you have enough experience to represent other areas of the game? how much experience do you have in high sec, low sec, and wormhole space?recent experience is in null sec, however before that i spent a lot of time up in high-sec running an industrial lifestyle along with my alliance that i lead at the time. we also had some great guys that took us into wormholes for daytrips to run sites and huff gas. a few times i took some small gangs out into low-sec to find some fights, sadly where we went it was uncommon to find people around, however fun was had when we did find them and i also have some funny stories from when i didn't know the mechanics all too well ;)4. a lot of players, perhaps even a majority, don't realize the csm even exists. how do you plan on getting feedback from players?naturally that is a hard one due to the fact they don't know it exists. personally i would be making pushes on as many forms of social media as possible to reach out to them. also using reddit and the forums. however to get to those that don't use that stuff, i would personally like to see some ingame notifications done to some extent. something like ""hey the csm are looking for player feedback on [activity], please help them out"" that way you can try and draw more people into the fold of at least knowing it exists, from there you can get them communicating if they hadn't already started.5. did you submit your paperwork to get on the ballot?yes, i had that issue the first time where it didn't go through. but huge props to ccp guard for clearing that up.thank you for the questions :) hope you enjoy the answers"
2/22/2017,"csm is more like a sounding board or a board made up of interest organisations without decision power than any political entity. like office politics, you don't decide by vote.if you think lying is a wanted part of politics, you're probably unfit for office, and if you think the csm can decide ccps priorities, you need a reality check. kind of like cq got, come to think of it."

2/23/2017,stay tuned for interview with matteralalso debate this weekend
2/23/2017,how did the first interview go? link?
2/23/2017,"first off, i've known the judge for years now.as far as i remember, he's always been present for people inside of our alliance or people outside of our alliance as head diplomat, and so always been a kind diplomat.more closely, he has ideas and his plans, always been to enhance peoples gameplay and to keep eve online at its best.his last career as csm member has shown that he followed for what he said and continuously brought feedbacks, presence ideas and to ccp and to its community.he's got all my votes for the following years."
2/23/2017,"i was wondering if you would answer some questions.1. you say you run incursions. do you fly with one of the communities on a regular basis? also, do you think the payout for incursions is too high, too low, or just right?2. you say that you've been involved in factional warfare. which faction and was it more as a plex farmer, or were you involved in combat?3. it sounds like you have a separate character for each area of the game you participate in. do you think that eve requires multiple accounts to play? and do you think that ccp should cater to those with multiple accounts?4. you said you have a character in test. were you involved in the catch war last month? if so, what is your opinion of the current sov warfare mechanics?"
2/23/2017,"1.) i think the pay out is good, however i do feel that the site mechanics may be adapted. more improved ai. the hardship in incursions is getting the fleets organized and enduring the endless grind.2.) in factional warfare i fought for amarr. this lead to both combat as well as plexing. i did not find this part of the game as thrilling as for example null sec warfare or npsi fleets. 3.) i do not believe that you will need multiple characters to play eve online. i have played the first 3 years without additional characters. it was not untill a friend of mine decided to quit and give me his character that i started multiboxing. however i do believe that playing the game with more characters really adds value to the quality of the gameplay. in short i wished i start multiboxing earlier.ccp should cater people with multiple accounts, like a staffle discount. first account 100% second account 95% or something. this way ccp would award loyal players who have made this game what it is today and reward players who are looking to invest more time and energy. therefor convincing more players to create more accounts.4.) i really dislike the current sov warfare mechanics. ccp changed them because it was supposed to lead to more interaction and combat. however i felt (besides the bugs, where timers ran out and then didnt disappear) that it became more of an endless grind, more boring then actually the incursion grind. ofcourse my sense of humor, moves me to say that it was ofcourse because test alliance is best alliance and nobody opposes us in catch and esoteria region. extra,i also do believe ccp should allow name changing. its one of those things that could not only bring in $$$, but also add more value to the game. for example people who started out as a joke, then got hooked but stuck with a ****** ass named character. or people who buy/sell characters and people who got characters (like me. cause i really do not like the name adare darmazaf, my test character)1) there should be a name history involved so people can always track them.2) searching on character unique id numbers3) name changing should be expensive so people wouldnt change names every week or so.more rules could be put up to make sure abuse of this mechanic would not occur.thank you for your interest rosewalker :)hopefully this answered some of your questions. if you have anything else do not hesitate to ask."
2/23/2017,"erika is smart, thoughtful, knowledgable and enthusiastic about eve. i believe she would be positive and productive csm member. i'm planning to give her a vote from all my accounts."
2/23/2017,"greetings, my name is afropty. i have been playing eve online since 2008 and would like the opportunity to collaborate with ccp on improving the game.i am very grateful for my experiences in eve. it has given me the opportunity to meet many great people from multiple countries. many have helped me to get a greater understanding of the game, and i have developed some great friendships in the process.the most challenging part for me is that communication in eve is predominately in english, and i am chilean. i have learned to play by the teachings of my fellows in english.i would like to improve the game for spanish speaking players. i have come to realize that there are many others like me who speak spanish primarily, which is cool.eve online is a big interactive game community and i would like to be part of the team making this game better for everyone.i hereby offer myself as a candidate for csm, and humbly ask for your support.worklist program:ship rebalanceimprove the currently navegation mechanicsingame applicationbattle reportsreview moon mining mechanicsyou can contact me ingame or on forums"

2/23/2017,did you fill out the application form and submit a photocopy of your passport to ccp?
2/23/2017,edited - 23/02/2017.
2/23/2017,"excuse me - cause im pretty new in all that csm stuff;do you have already prepare ideas for the points what u described or it's like""if you choose me ill take care about it and figure it out something"";?"
2/23/2017,"hey naye,thanks for your query. i do already have a few ideas written down from the dot points that i mention in my main post. some ideas are still a work-in-progress. of course, there will be more ideas to come in the future and i am always open to ideas from the player community. as the csm are meant to be a bridge between the community and ccp, i feel that a lot of these ideas would need to be discussed with ccp first before coming up with a solid plan to tackle the improvements or feedback suggested by players. some ideas suggested by players might already be something that ccp is working on, so there is a possibility that there is a working plan in place for some of these ideas. as a csm i cannot promise to ""take care of things"" for you, but i will do my very best to allow your voice to be heard by ccp.thanks,viktor"
2/23/2017,"introductionwelcome prospective disciples of the rorqual. while i normally would begin with a lengthy sermon as to why the rorqual is the finest ship in eve and that all capsuleers should aspire to fly one, i'm pretty late in posting this as it is! first, think about these questions:are you satisfied with flying a single ishtar for your dank ratting ticks or do you find it necessary to afk five of them on all the havens in the system? do you hate hisec incursion community voice comms so much that you have or will build an incursion fleet to clear sites all by yourself? do you believe proper 'solo pvp' is baiting svipuls into medium plexes where your five recon alts are happily orbiting the beacon? do you like to drop 10 or more bombers on hapless provi ratters or afk freighter pilots? do you believe that unless you're making more than 1bn isk/hr you're playing like a casual? if your answer to any of the above questions are yes or at least maybe, keep reading.platformdo you enjoy multiboxing? i do. a lot. and there have been a lot of changes and new restrictions on multiboxing over the past few years - such as no broadcasting and partial window overlays. some of these changes are fair and i have zero intent on trying to change the current eula. however, there is a stigma that sometimes comes to multiboxers - a belief that they may be botting or skirting the rules. suicide gank multibox pilots getting banned for nebulous reasons. who on the csm have stood for and defended multiboxers? how many times was multiboxing referenced in the last csm summit? well, if you vote for me, i'll stand for you!about mei started out in e-uni doing the normal new player things and eventually joined mercenary coalition to participate in my first large scale conflict since starting to play eve. but it wasn't enough just being a single dps or logistics pilot in fleets. i needed to do more. whether this was bringing in alt links, spreading out cynos, readying a capital alt - i wanted to do more than just f1. it was around the middle of last year i saw a post on r/eve claiming that you could make 1.2b an hour multiboxing vanguard sites. welp, here i am doing that and a bunch of other things with far too many accounts. i've done region-wide cloaky camping and salt mining, ice-belt clearing in one and a half hours mining (praise the rorqual!), infuriating griffin swarms, 165 p0-p2 planets (yeah, that only lasted a month), and dropping 10 bombers on 'snakes. i've got a few more things in the cooker as well (the kusions can't have all the fun). i've also been involved with our alliance tournament team in addition to shooting stuff for profit, building api tools using xml through esi (happy to share if requested), promoting mining cultural revolutions, and battled the menace that is ess drama. so while i can hold the door on negative impacts to multiboxing, i also have enough experience to discuss other aspects of the game and relate back to the playerbase.why i stand outthere are a lot of big names on the ballot and four fewer spots to fill - i get it, i've got my work cut out for me. however, if you consider my platform and my accomplishments, some things stand out: organizational capability, exposure to a wide range of eve, and unadulterated efficiency. i feel these are strong attributes of an effective csm member. and if you've been paying attention, i have a ton of bloody characters. i'm pretty damn invested in this game, so it's in my great interest to see it continue to grow and continue to be engaging. this is why i am running for csm and why you should vote for me.thank you for reading!(side note: late thread posting, the application was submitted within the deadline)contactreddit - elowenn (preferred)discord - solidus#1465 (personal channel for csm:"
2/23/2017,reserved as that's the thing to do. /avoids reserving 10 times per habit.
2/23/2017,"solidus may be a carebear scrublord, but he's our lovable scrublord.you have my axe...and my vote."
2/23/2017,so key braodcasting isnt likely to return. as it opens up a can of worms for botting and non human controlled input. what are your throughts on this.also i run 4 accounts in incursions with no isboxer or anything. its easy enough to do without it.
2/23/2017,+1 endorsement
2/23/2017,"yeah, input broadcasting is very close to botting, albeit some mmos allow it currently (wow to my knowledge is one of them). i don't intend to advocate for change on that particular aspect. there are methods out there to quickly and efficiently perform actions on multiple clients legally (eve-o preview, a hotkey that opens the next window) - but the concern i have is that ccp reviews this activity server side rather than client side. what happens when a multiboxer gets good enough to get those inputs in on a single or two-tick cycle? this is what i want to look at further."
2/23/2017,so i run 4 of 10 accounts in an incursion. now its muscle memory at this point but its also fair. with scroll time and that i rarely if ever have actions effect more than 1 account per second i think or i believe their system would be smart enough to see broadcasting happen serverside as its not easy to hit for instance vanguard incursions 10 accounts in the same 2 second window.. i run 4 screens and move the cursor between them doing everything manualy. i feel that this is fair as it falls in the eula as fair game to do. due to the past controversy over isboxer and key broadcasting what makes you think ccp would be amenable to this change considering the long term bans people have recieved over it currently? should these people have their accounts reactivated retroactively?
2/23/2017,somehow i double-posted
2/23/2017,have you filled out the application form and submitted a photocopy of your passport to ccp?
2/24/2017,"fact is you were probably not around in eves early years.fact is eve grew fastest in the ovuer years and tapered off and then declined after that fact is for years ccp falcon and others have not understood why, how and what eve was designed as, and so have never understood why it was initially successful and why it then stagnated when it veered off course.likelihood is given its early success, something relatively rare for mmos launched by small independents, it should have continued to grow, even if that growth was modest but it didnt. in business thats called success, declining is called failure.the fact that is most appropriate and important in terms of your quote above is eve grew fastest at the time when the devs actively discouraged and denounced ganking, and that was in the first critical years of eve while ovuer, the original lead dev and the person most responsible for it becoming a reality was at the helm. ovuer link on ganking"
2/24/2017,"you clutch to that quote like an orphan might to the last remaining photograph of their long deceased parents, who gazes longingly at it remembering better times that really only exist in their mind. if you put that quote into a search engine, it is apparent that you have trotted it out multiple times over the years to make a point that simply isn't true. first, it doesn't mean what you think it means. oveur said ""not easily"" for design intention of ""pirating"". he didn't say that all highsec violence should be ""impossible"" or something like that. well, pirating is not easy in highsec. almost all transport goes unmolested in highsec, and only a small number of players even attempt it. ccp spent years after that quote nerfing highsec piracy by removing insurance, buffing hulls and concord and the like to make highsec a hard place to be a pirate. second, over the years multiple ccp devs have confirmed that suicide ganking and a not 100% safe highsec is working as intended. i've linked some in this thread already, but you also can find examples in the minutes (p. 59) or this devblog detailing changes to suicide ganking which specifically says they want players to be able to shoot each other in highsec. heck, if you go through those search results you'll even see your beloved ccp oveur use phrases like ""you can pvp anywhere, as long as you take the consequences"". you are denying the undeniable: ccp wants non-consensual pvp to be possible in highsec and ccp intends for it not to be 100% safe. this has always been the case, since eve was just in the conceptual stage, all through to today. i don't know why or how you have constructed this alternate reality in your head which claims that for some reason, ccp has been unable to make highsec safe after all these years even though they really want it to be, or that ccp oveur had some divine claim to the development of eve online and was doing his best to make highsec 100% safe but was usurped by ccp falcon and his htfu crew, but you are completely mistaken. actually, probably more like completely deluded. your alternate history is utterly false, and requires leaps of faith and in logic so large, it would do the most rabid conspiracy theorist credit. seriously, your bemoaning the fact the eve online isn't what you want it to be serves no one. eve is what it is, and that unambiguously includes an unsafe highsec where you are indeed at risk to other players. and it always has, even back in oveur's days. in fact, since oveur left, highsec has only been made safer, year after year, buff after buff, and that has correlated with less logins, less activity and less content in highsec and in the rest of new eden. i shudder to think what would happen if in your alternative universe a ccp oveur was still a lead developer and was given free reign to implement the carebear paradise you accuse him of wanting. the servers probably would have been shut off years ago. good thing this is all just in your head."
2/24/2017,"but it isn't just in ziona's head. the attempts to make hs safer and safer. answering the call of the carebears to nerf wars, nerf ganking is indeed a thing. of course ccp does it and it never works out. that is why we keep hearing the whine for more nerfs."
2/24/2017,i have for the last while been dealing with a lag producing problem. that is the in station advertisments are such that they do produce lag to a point i can not access my containers to place or retrieve items i need. i have a low end laptop using intergrated graphics and it literally has to be able to over come this by some means.so there fore my proposal is this;that we should have the option made available to turn off the advertising especially on lower end systems as mine is.there should be a method through the menu to do this like you can with the dynamic camera which i turned off as a result of the lag as well when changing ships. there is no need to create an environment that would force me to upgrade to a high performance system because of this.who ever is responsible for this needs to go and see what can be done to introduce a method to turn those off and release it to tq. makes for a qol improvement.thank you.
2/24/2017,eve prosper mention of official endorcement again last night on the live stream. available on playback via eve prosper yourube or twitch channels
2/24/2017,new content:an interview in german on evepodcast.de:
2/24/2017,scylus has built ccdm from a 50 man single corp into the biggest fw alliance in a **** militia.the man knows his stuff. got my vote for sure.
2/24/2017,"even though i haven't known scylus that long, he is a clear forerunner in the fw space. with templis running solidly in the warzone under his command, i think he is the clear choice to represent the lowsec space. he has been in the area for a long time and understands the dynamic changes that the global changes have made to our sectors.+1 for scylus."
2/24/2017,short friendly interview i did with scylus about his csm run this evening.
2/24/2017,so now that you're being evicted are you going to mjd out of your csm campaign?
2/24/2017,"thank you so much mynxee, that means a lot to me!"
2/24/2017,1
2/24/2017,"just curious, are you involved in any of the debates i heard are upcoming?"
2/24/2017,"yes, i will be in one of the ones that are being hosted by jeff/rhivre on the 5th of march. also just completed an interview with matterall."
2/24/2017,"it depends really - when you use a lot of accounts you want to be efficient. as long as you're not broadcasting, you can still get ""good"" enough to get multiple character actions out per tick. i would be able to bring these perspectives to ccp in a more direct fashion as part of the csm. ultimately it is up to ccp to enforce their eula but if they were to review borderline cases and understand what could be done, legally, they could reconsider their choices. csms can only advocate and that would be my plan. :)"
2/24/2017,why are we terrible pubbies.
2/25/2017,"of course its in my head - where else would it be. i have first hand knowledge and experience of eve from its inception to launch over every change and expansion. do you?oveurs post is trotted out whenever i read nonesense like your post. you are either deliberately misleading or ignorantly misleading people on the forums with crap like that.the post states a number of things and its from the ultimate source, the lead and original eve developer.see next post for details"
2/25/2017,"oveurs post:1: piracy / ganking in high sec should be difficult - its absurdly easy 2: highsec is supposed to be relatively safe (compared to low null) its currently the most dangerous space for various reasons. oveur bolded this to emphasize it.3: he states you should need to go to low null for non-consensual pvp.fact is pvp in eve was always supposed to be non-consensual. war decs were put into game to allow for pvp in high sec. risk was supposed to be high especially in high sec, low risk concord protected easy ganking with low cost ships is an abberation from the intended high risk designed pvp.now things have changed no doubt, we have new devs who have lost or never understood the hardcore philosophy of original eve however if you try to claim it was always easy and the design was always the way it is now ill post oveurs statement again to show you're full of it"
2/25/2017,"piracy, as a profession is almost impossible in highsec. either we are looking at a different set of facts, or you have an unconventional use of the term. the only thing you can make a profit shooting in highsec is haulers that another player has chosen to put too much value into. mining ships, even the most undertanked ones, do not drop enough to allow the suicide ganker to make a living. maybe they can cover the costs in the best case scooping their own wreck, but there is no isk for a pirate there. and the tanked ones? it can take a dozen players and 100m+ isk loss in ships to shoot it, what all for 10m isk in loot drops? mission ships are even more safe, and usually have the protection of a mission gate that makes them 100% safe in there from outlaws. haulers are the only thing that can be shot for piracy, simply because the player gets to determine how much to put in there. no matter how high ccp sets the costs to attack, the hauler can put more goods in the ship thus making themselves a profitable target for the pirate. however, ccp has raised the cost to attack over and over again, leaving quite a generous window for haulers to operate. it takes dozens of players and hundreds of millions in ships to even attempt an attack on a freighter which can yield nothing if the attack is thwarted by the hauler or her friends, or if the loot fairy is unkind. i can get that someone might claim that suicide ganking isn't hard enough, because, hey, why not complain that the other guy has it too easy? whining is easy and cheap, certainly less difficult than actually playing the game. therefore, i can easily just write you off as 'uninformed' or, perhaps more likely in your case, a person with an agenda to make highsec 100% safe because you have brought too much of your real-world persona and morals into a spaceship shooting video game. what i can't get is how you constructed a narrative in your head that highsec piracy is somehow easier than it used to be in oveur's time and that is hurting the game somehow. back in that era, ships were flimsier, concord took much longer to arrive, and even if you failed a suicide gank, the silly people at pend insurance would reimburse a large fraction of the cost of your ship. at times, you could make a living as a 'pirate' just suiciding your battleship into the side of a station because the insurance payout was higher than the cost of the ship. the reality is mechanically, highsec has never been safer. this is undeniable. there have been dozens of changes, both direct and indirect to highsec piracy, and with only a few exceptions, they have all gone in the same direction: they nerfed it and made it harder, just like oveur said ccp intends. and it has worked. most people in highsec have nothing to fear from a pirate - the costs to attack are so high there is zero profit to be had in the majority of cases. the only reason highsec piracy happens at all is that haulers, especially the most imprudent of them, have adjusted to each increase in safety by hauling more stuff, and there are just so many of players in general attracted by the safety highsec generally offers. all the reasonable metrics (like the ones ccp quant provides) say that highsec is indeed, the safest space as ccp intends. you have the least chance of losing your ships there by an order or two of magnitude when compared to the other spaces where there is no, or very little cost to attack another player. but as to your point 3, nowhere does he say ""you should need to go to low null for non-consensual pvp"". all he says is you should go to low/null if you want to be a pirate, aka make a living from shooting other people's spaceships. if ccp wanted highsec to be free of non-consensual pvp, they could do it tomorrow with a single line of code preventing us from using the red safety setting. further, wars are are a significant source of non-consensual pvp (at least at the group level) which have been there since oveur's time. this idea of yours that ccp, or a favoured developer of yours at ccp, wants or wanted a 100% safe, non-consensual pvp-free, highsec is bullocks. this was never the case and never will be the case. it is just something you want so much for your own personal reasons it is clouding your interpretation of reality."
2/25/2017,its clear from the screenshot hes replying to someone whinging about concord being beefed up - hes clearly referring to ganking i
2/25/2017,"back when concord was vastly weaker than it is now. and yet, here we are with yet another whine...""just one more nerf and all will be well.""never mind that players logged in are declining.subs, which are most likely correlated with players logged in are probably also declining.yes, ccp has been clever about monetizing the remaining player base...which ironically leads to more whining about pay to win, usually from the likes of you.might there have been justification for buffing concord back then? maybe. but this is now, not then. so trying to use an argument from over a decade ago would be like arguing that because we were in a deep recession 7 years ago, we should pursue counter cyclical economic policies now. it is just stupid an nothing more than an argument from an out-dated authority who probably knows nothing about where the game is now.and seriously, i am so sick of people whining about suicide ganking. it only works now because some moron puts too much stuff in his freighter turning it into a loot pinata. how stupid does one be to put 7 billion into an anti-tanked ship that can be taken down by 15 players in 150 million isk worth of ships? pretty goddamned stupid. you know what happens with stupid people? the rest of us have to clean up after them. i have zero sympathy for a dumbass that turns his ship into a loot pinata. none. they were stupid and they were taught a lesson. if they don't like the consequences of their stupidity, well too bad for them.and spare me the consequences for the gankers. they paid the consequences for their actions. their ships were destroyed. yes, an alt or buddy scooped the loot and in the end they profited...but only because some other moron was too stupid to realize he was creating a suicide ganking opportunity.seriously. grow up. take responsibility for your actions. stop wanting others to do what you need to do for yourself. goddamn child."
2/25/2017,i dont lose sleep over ganking either im simply refuting dark pedros incorrect statement that ganking was intended and encoragedearly on in eve. devs didnt like it and they initially worked hard to reduce it.
2/25/2017,"who gives a **** if it was intended or not. eve is a game of emergence or spontaneous order--i.e. we will get things nobody intended. that is the goddamned point of the game. to get things nobody intends.did ccp intend pipe bombs? probably not. did they intend the ""false pos"" probably not. did they intend rental empires? did they intend something like red frog? did they intend coalitions? there are lots of things in game that ccp did not intend...that is the nature of the game.so your observation is pretty useless...kind of like you."
2/25/2017,"let me ask this...did ccp intend for the rise of professional freighter ganking organizations? well with all their nerfing that is what those dingbats got. whether they intended it or not.here is a hint for dimbulbs like you: when you have a system of spontaneous order and emergence...trying to control it, to direct it...it often blows up in your face.edit: unless you control it so much you throttle the life out of it...which, look ccp seems to be doing a fine job.ccp employees should come into work every day and look at eve offline. then spend 2 hours on their resumes, then do their days work. they are busy working on putting themselves out of work."
2/25/2017,it was misinformation. why make **** up?
2/25/2017,my point is: who cares? whether it was intended or not...it is what they got with an open classless system with few rules--i.e. a sandbox.so maybe they thought it was a bit too much or too easy and they ratcheted up the difficult level...no need to take it past 11 and break the goddamn game. hs content sucks. pve is boring. hs pvp is all but gone. mass war decs and freighter ganking and a band of terrorists being subsidized to attack miners. that's it.
2/25/2017,"oveur clearly uses the term ""piracy"". even if you interpret his use of piracy to mean all non-consensual pvp, he says ccp intends for piracy to be ""not easy"" in highsec. he didn't say ""impossible"" or ""not allowed"" or whatever you seem to be interpreting that as. ccp has always intended for pvp, both consensual and non-consensual, to be possible in highsec, as long as you accept the consequences. that has always been how it works and how it was intended to work. your version of reality does not exist. feel free to make the case that non-consensual pvp is currently ""too easy"" in highsec, but claiming that highsec was intended to be 100% free of non-consensual pvp, even by your beloved ccp oveur, is a pure fabrication of yours."
2/25/2017,got my support. thank you for the convo last night
2/25/2017,scylus black numbah one!
2/25/2017,"i was wondering if you would answer a couple of questions.1. i get the impression you are an fc. what type of fleets do you like to take out?2. your alliance currently lives in malpais. do you do a lot of mining and industry?3. you would like ccp to address moon goo. is that from personal experience moon mining and/or running reaction farms, or due to something else?4. what are the things about citadels that you would like to see changed?5. living in malpais you are surrounded by the brothers of tangra, a rental alliance. what are your thoughts on rental empires?"
2/25/2017,hmmm nah
2/25/2017,"while it is nice seeing somebody running on a faction warfare platform, i don't believe you are the best candidate for this, simply because of your attitude in game. today there was a fight between siege green and dhsj, and even after your fc called good fight and ""content is content"" you instead resorted to wishing the other side contracted aids, and wished that that would get hit and maimed by a bus."
2/25/2017,um can u not copy me
2/25/2017,"such abhorrent behavior should not be tolerated, more so from a csm candidate. if you are so easily angered by someone calling out a welp that you would resort to wanting physical harm inflicted upon him, how can we as a community trust your decisions to do right by the community? you will not have my vote and i will campaign so that others also reject your submission."
2/25/2017,"g'day everyone!if you're interested in hearing my aussie accent and getting to know a bit more about me, then feel free to have a listen to the talking in stations podcast interview hosted by materrall. here is a link to the my interview;"
2/25/2017,please explain your ideas around improvements to war dec mechanics.
2/25/2017,"hey natural clonekiller,thanks for your query :-)there have been many suggestions brought to me in regards to making improvements to war dec mechanices. a lot of these suggestions would require further investigation, but i can let you know of one idea that has been suggested to me.there could be a way for a corporation to pay a fee to concord in order to have their war dec removed early or to prevent it from happening. this would please a lot of those smaller corps who get war dec and don't really engage in warfare. it really hurts the game in general if people just go offline for two weeks because they are war dec, opposed to giving them an opportunity to continue playing by offering a system to pay off the war dec. i realize that there will be people who are on the other side of this argument who enjoy using the current war dec mechanic. and i am open to suggestions from those people who have ideas for war dec mechanics. that's just one of the suggestions that has been brought to me. of course it's not going to be a simple process, but i just wanted to respond to your query with an example.thanks for your time,viktor koraka"
2/25/2017,meine stimme hast du! prima welche dinge du angehen willst!
2/25/2017,"i was wondering if you could answer some questions.1) what area of the game do you play?2) do you pvp, or are you more industry focused?3) you mentioned something called the ""eve an hour"" campaign. what is that for those like me who have never heard of it before? and is it still active? your mention of it leaves a lot of questions.4) have you ever been in a corp or alliance leadership position? if so, what challenges do/did face that ccp could help with by changing features in the game?"
2/25/2017,"1. not many. the most complex tool i released was skynet, which was the first fleet manager made using the crest fleet endpoints. it primarily provided a more user friendly overview of the data available in the in-game fleet composition window, but complaints about the limitations imposed by the api endpoints on ccp's side and a general lack of interest caused me to stop active development, and further versions weren't publicly released.on the bright side, i heard that several people found my code useful as a guide to using the fleet endpoints, which were undocumented at the time (though i did manage to write up the documentation eventually), and proceeded to make fleet managers/assistants of their own.moving on to simpler tools i made this lp store browser, which pulls its data live from tq, and this structure browser which is just a quick thing i made for checking when your citadel runs out of fuel.other than that, all other tools i made are for internal use only, for now.2. i maintained interest, but as my corp already has many people involved in those activities, i stopped participating in them as to leave me with more time for other activities and them with less competition :)3. there are a lot of provibloc candidates this year, and i'm really glad to see them getting involved. what sets me apart from them? i'm more focused on the information management in eve than some specific areas. you could say that it's what really drives the game, and all the spaceship violence is just a fortunate side effect of it. aside from that, i'd say most of us provi candidates are similarly aligned with respect to eve's more tangible issues.4. i consider the in-game map to be the worst offender here, as it offers tons of free intel on every k-space system. however, information blackout is currently the domain of w-space, and that intel is relied on by many people, so any changes or removal of it would be a rather complicated matter.as i said in my blog, knowing when to stop with the amount of information available over apis is important, and i also take issue with various game mechanics which leak information (convo someone to check if they're online, for example).5. i'm fairly satisfied with the progress so far. integrating the documentation process into the development process is by far the biggest improvement, and the architecture changes should allow for better performance and introduction of features which used to be impossible.while ccp is making progress on it faster than i expected, it is still coming along very slowly, and reliability issues are preventing some people from switching to esi.6. discord/slack bots and the such."
2/26/2017,"well thank you for stopping by my thread...not really sure i understood what you were getting at here. of course making it fun for high sec players is a very important thing... i do not agree with you there. but then i have written about that on previous posts and my blog.there is a long thread on the eve forums about bumping... have you read it?as you quite rightly say, i was indeed quite right.there are many things that one could change in war decs to make the system more workable... changing the relations between allies is one of them... especially with the large number of small corporations that might have to band together (as if that would ever happen)... the population of high sec will probably never change in this respect. i think that we are still in the relatively early days of citadels... but over the years i expect we will reach some sort of equilibrium... thanks for taking the time to write."
2/26/2017,"1. i get the impression you are an fc. what type of fleets do you like to take out?i can fc, but smaller groups. i prefer alpha boats, or rlml swarms at present. i much prefer to sit and wait for roams to come to me than go out looking for fights (you surprisingly get more fights some days :) )2. your alliance currently lives in malpais. do you do a lot of mining and industry?yes, fusion has had a strong industrial past, but we have decent level of pvper to protect our industry. we used to do a lot of mining, but the rorqual changes have polarised many miners into its either rorqual or nothing, and with the speed wh gangs are rolling wh while hunting for rorquals, it has put a lot of miners off even bothering to undock. 3. you would like ccp to address moon goo. is that from personal experience moon mining and/or running reaction farms, or due to something else?in the past our corp has had money moons, at the peak, 11 tech moons when tech was 220k pu.... the problem with goo moons is, either you get them handed to you, or its not isk worth trying to take them from others. the usual fight over a goo tower will cost 20b+ in order to take the moon, which is multiple months roi, making it kinda pointless attacking it in the first place. if you have the towers, odds are, your not going to lose the income from them.i would like to see goo moved off of moons, and moved to anomalies that spawn like data sites/ gas sites. in order to keep the present levels, you would need to have 2 or 3 sites per moon of goo spawn, with 3 or 4 days worth of goo to harvest. also having a site spawn elsewhere once one is deleted would remove the dowmtime rush. gas mining would make it more accessible to everyone. it would also help move some miners from ore to goo hunting, and it would encourage full use of all systems in regions with people looking for the goo sites. 4. what are the things about citadels that you would like to see changed?main thing would be the anchoring 'exploit' people are using at present inorder to get 21 days invul after first anchoring it. second thing would be the ability to have an overview when viewing outside... if you presently stick your head out of some structures, you really cannot see anything smaller than a capital. 5. living in malpais you are surrounded by the brothers of tangra, a rental alliance. what are your thoughts on rental empires?rental empires are both good and bad. they give the opportunity for small industrial/pve corps to try out null without joining a big blocdownside is they fund the big alliances to get bigger, making it harder for new people to the scene to take space."
2/26/2017,does my reddit shitposting also countshitposting is shitposting famalso just fyi that convo calls that guy out for something unrelated
2/26/2017,"i had a really nice chat with matterall for the talking in stations podcast, my first interview ever.check it out here:"
2/26/2017,how wouldn't be horde without kalibur.
2/26/2017,"nice resume, simple questions for youhow much do you answer to the upper ranks of pl and others and how much are you your 'own'. will you expect to continue to be able to do the good work you do fi csm takes a fair share of your time or have you considered handing off responsibilities?mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
2/26/2017,
2/27/2017,"i've been lucky enough to catch both ashterothi (from crossing zebras) and matterall (from imperium news network). if you'd like to listen to some more casual discussion from me, take a listen!"
2/27/2017,"pve landing pads.say you are sent out on a delivery by your favorite agent, instead of going thru the entire docking sequence and such, make landing pads on/around the stations. players can select the station and click on the 'landing pad' to have the ship war (if at range) and automatically begin landing on an available pad. after some time has passed, the delivery shows as complete, and you can 'depart' the landing pad and be on your mary way. if all landing pads are busy, then you can just do a normal ""dock"" into the station and continue as normal.this option could also be used when delivering/picking up contracts from players."
2/27/2017,"i will be hosting a ustz and an eutz ama on reddit this week, i will see if there's a way i can do au/rutz as well, but that's pretty hard for me because of being 12 hours apart. if there's any au/rutz people who want to contact me, you can feel free to contact me in game @jonn duune"
2/27/2017,removed an off-topic post.
2/27/2017,"might have some questions for your ama. just wondering when you're gonna have it, so do you have a date and time or something? don't really like any of the other wh candidates i've seen so far."
2/27/2017,"having flown with this pilot before his community statement would be more accurate if it were this:i support the community when it has the same views as myself, if someone has differing views to my own i will go out of my way to berate, speak over, down to and make personal threats against those other line members"
2/27/2017,"due to various personal threats made by this pilot i wish to state that a vote for this candidate will do nothing but further damage the public brand image of the csm. while stellan is a very passionate and enthusiastic player, these types of people should not be considered for csm members."
2/27/2017,"i recognise that there has been issues in the past, and i<U+FFFD>ll admit my doing then. i apologise for the issues. there<U+FFFD>s been water under the bridge since."
2/27/2017,"i'm not sure that's only for you to decide. you mention several community structures in your op. i agree that the community is what makes this game so great. does community and working together go so far as trying to white knight a corp or leaking apis when you don't get your way? i recognize that these actions and many others are completely valid and acceptable forms of eve gameplay, but they're hardly actions that would promote and encourage discussion and/or change for good wouldn't you think? how would this translate to being an effective voice within the csm?"
2/27/2017,"please note, this is not a troll post, this is purely a clarification of facts.you made personal threats against other players (indicating physical harm out of game). this is not a quality trait of someone who should be considered a representative of the community and the community should be aware of this."
2/27/2017,"+1you'll always have my vote, keep those reforms coming."
2/27/2017,"well here i am, ive been playing eve since october 2008. ive literally been to every corner of the game and have been in almost every major conflict since i started. i'm running for csm cause i believe i know what the players want, i think i know enough players from all facets of eve, and have made enough friends to have a good knowledge of what the players want. so anyways figured id throw my hat in the ring and see what hapened."
2/27/2017,"ever heard of world war bee(wwb)?killah bee was essentially the project manager for such a feat tasked to coordinate dozens of entities totaling over 40,000 characters to engage a similar sized entrenched foe. not only did killah bee display great team management skills, he also surpassed all communication expectations effectively coordinating advanced war tactics through multiple time zones in various languages.killah bee is well cultured in the eve universe having acquired experience in many different disciplines. voting killah bee onto the csm would not only benefit every pilot in eve but it would also benefit the csm. every csm member is expected to communicate with the panel and ccp. with an effective communicator and natural leader such as killah bee on the panel, progress is sure to be made.if you support killah bee's platform, be sure to cast a vote his direction. rest assured these causes will be carefully prepared and adequately delivered."
2/27/2017,dancul deserves more visibility for the platform he is running on. definitely a solid candidate for all of eve.
2/28/2017,the thing you've described is just another symptom. the disease is a csm itself.
2/28/2017,added youtube link for matterall interview.
2/28/2017,"having known jin since he were a podling, it has been a pleasure to see him grow and develop into the great young fella he is today.he has demonstrated that he can bring consistancy and transparancy where possible to not just the csm but also to the relationship between the csm and ccp. he has also evidenced what he has done and where he has helped to make an impact in the game.thus he will certainly get my vote.with respectmaxoh, and i may be the one responsible for introducing him to tequila and whisky chasers. i would say can you remember the notts meet but we know how that ended for you.bad max.. bad !"
2/28/2017,approved candidacy by ccp for the 4th year. check the full list
2/28/2017,"lorelei, you have a 100% chance of walking away from most ganks - if you're prepared to take some precautions and to use the tools with which ccp has provided you.if you're implying that ganking is too easy (i.e. needs to be nerfed), then you should really come out and say so, citing whatever evidence you can produce (i think you'll struggle there, to be frank).i think you might more usefully describe yourself as the highsec carebearing candidate, and have done with it. you obviously won't be able honestly to represent the pvpers and pirates who daily bring content to the region.i'm working my way down the list of candidates, hoping that someone from highsec will take on the challenging task of stopping the drip-drip-drip of nerfs to our playstyle and get those carebears actually involved in the game. it's an mmo, not a multi-single-player-online rpg.but i realise that expecting a lone candidate to represent the interests of such a broad constituency may be just too much."
2/28/2017,"thanks for stopping by my thread, sasha. i've listened to several of you recordings. i think they are nice.i don't think ganking is too easy. did you read the discussions at the time in my last two campaign threads? i think what i think was quite well talked about...did you see my post about my ideas for concord adjustments? 2015/08/concord.html what do you think about what i said in my opening post about making changes to local chat?i do (for example) definitely think that just adding more ehp to mining barges is not the right way to go about adjusting things.really? i think i could represent pvpers and pirates. of course, more pvp and pirate oriented players would have to tell me what they think/feel... but that is what communication would be for. if i were to be elected i would be spending more time talking to people and less time flying around niarja. what do you think pvpers an pirates want? and what do you think a member of the csm can actually do?getting carebears more involved in the game would be a great thing, and that is why it is important for ccp to keep tweaking and developing the npe. i would be very interested to see information about where in the npe the majority of ""new"" players stop and quit eve (see summit minutes). last year your alliance supported xenuria. probably you will be doing it again. that is not necessarily a bad thing... just not a high sec thing.i know. i do not think i ever said anything about wanting to make solo-play easier. i am also in favour of increasing the possibilities to be social and interact with other players - and my thoughts about social player corporations have not changed over the last couple of years.noone can do everything. but high sec needs voices, and high sec is worth fighting for!"
2/28/2017,"serves me right for being lazy / pushed for time...i was called out about wardecs. i do not know much about war deccing, not really having done it in any great way... but i am aware that war dec in high sec and also the bounty mechanics are very much broken... so much so that war decs just do not impact my play in any way... in case of dec drop corps and reform.... or wait it out. in fact in my original campaign war decs were #4 on ""the list""""4) wardecs.the war dec mechanic is broken. there have already been talks/suggestions about enabling player groups that are not eligible for ""war deccing"" but also not eligible to put up pos or pocos.... this is a central theme to new player retention, and not to be ignored. i am also quite prepared to represent/push issues that other high sec carebears have, even if i have not mentioned them above. i think it is all-important that high sec gathers behind a candidate... (even if it is not me) so that our interests do not get swept under the table by the massed/organised nullsec coalitions."""

2/28/2017,"a couple of questions,-capital ships size are wrong, any fix for them? ( force auxiliary are too big, carriers are too small ).-ship bumping mechanics are so weird, a frig can bump a titan, any change or modification?-spanish language support?good luck ncc 1709 o7"
2/28/2017,"language support, well that's in ccp's best interest to arrange for as many languages as possible. but unlike most other games, eve contains thousands of words, a large selection of which are not easily translatable to multiple languages. what i would like to see integrated into the in-game chat's would be the option to translate a section of a chat window by highlighting and right click. ship sizes have been off for many years. the most obvious example of this is the macherial. i believe it is still in the original size scale of most ships before their re-render size reduction.it would be nice to see them all re-sized relative to their 'list size', which would cause most ships to be reduced in size rather than increased. bumping, that's a different kettle of fish. the mass ratio of capitals relative to their size is too low. if a capital has speed, it should shrug off a bump from a lower mass ship with ease, but due to the squiffy mass equations used, the capital ships tend to react to the bump when the bump should be a smear on the windscreen. while it would be nice to see some effort put into fixing this, i dont see it making much difference to bumping within eve its self. if it requires more people to bumps, them more people will be used.if collision damage is added, then the odds are it would be abused in some unforseen way. but i would still like to see collision mechanics fixed"
2/28/2017,"with any luck, i'm going to do 2, i'm thinking an eutz one sometime around 1800-1900 on wednesday, and a ustz one around 0100 on saturday. but because of my propensity to bring out salt, i'm going to ask the reddit mods to be present and strictly moderating any offtopic threads."
2/28/2017,"i've had a few questions rolling around in my head for quite a while. with c4 site payouts failing to match the isk/hr of c3 sites, as well as access to k-space being limited by statics, what is your proposition for bringing c4 sites in line with the difficulty of their pve content? i know that the obvious answer is to grab a c4 with a 3 or a 5 as a static (maybe even both! got one of these a few days ago), and just run sites in there for smoother isk/hr, but this leaves a large portion of c4 space with very poor options for making isk. long, uncomfortable chains are inevitable in wormholes, but are especially prevalent in c4 highways where the only residents are russians doing pi. lifting the amount of available isk in c4's will go a long way towards encouraging residency in the ""deeper"" wormholes without kspace statics. for now, c2 wormholes remain the most desired for their access to k and jspace, the kind of flexibility that only this class of wormhole offers. i think this is creating a poor environment for wspace, leaning towards an increase in evictions as opposed to residents. nothing wrong with evictions, but when one of the perceived issues in wspace is a lack of content and population, it wouldn't hurt to begin slowly increasing the incentives for c4 residents. denizens of middle-class wormholes live in a frustrating environment, but i think the answer is to give them a bit more reward rather than alter the dynamic of c4 with the pair of jspace statics. your corp info states that you also reside in a c4, which gives me hope that these will be the kinds of issues you will spend time on. other c4 corps have stated this as one of the most serious issues for middle-class, but nobody has really come forward to offer a solution. uniformity in wormhole classes isn't exciting, but neither is imbalance in isk availability per unit time. looking forward to your response, as well as your ustz ama."
2/28/2017,good luck white. you have my vote. i know you're good for it.
2/28/2017,"to give the player base insight to how stellan is in the game as well as out i'm going to post this conversation between stellan and ""no named mcgee"" (player that i will keep anonymous)this isn't meant to be personal but it will be taken that way. this is being put out to make sure that anyone considering to vote for him understands that he is a bomb shell and will not result in a good candidate for csm*snip* 35. posting of chat logs outside the crime & punishment forum channel is prohibited.the posting of chat logs between player parties is prohibited on all forum channels of the eve online forums, with the exception of the crime & punishment channel where they can be posted as part of stories in the pirate story thread.specific rules regarding the omission of pilot names apply in this instance. further details can be found in the rules stickies in the crime & punishment forum channel.restoring in this post can result in a forum ban. *snip* isd max trix."

2/28/2017,"no, this was a mistake on my part and have asked ccp to correct it. i apologise for the confusion. hopefully, the error will be fixed soon."
2/28/2017,since this mistake led me to you....endorse the cause #quieroeveenespa<U+FFFD>ol ...we need a localize spanish client. +400 million people speak the second most spoken language in the world yet in new eden it is just a whisper.if want to have my vote and tons of eve players that speak spanish do this. we are growing in eve faster than any other cultural/language base with dozens of countries all over the globe after the alpha clone patch ran. it's time for ccp to act on this<U+FFFD>.we need the support of the csm on this.
2/28/2017,"yes, eve should also come en espa<U+FFFD>ol. i was actually surprised that ccp chose french over spanish as their latest localisation effort when the spanish speaking community is several times larger than the french one. i support this initiative."
2/28/2017,"after listening to you on podcasts and interviews i have a few questions.on podcasts you seem to be a bit of a wall flower. from what i've seen you have often been unable to follow a continuous train of thought and have hearing issues (i'm aware you're disabled). do you think you would you be able overcome this in a business setting? you haven't had much to say and fall back on the 'gamer girl' act a lot. the cutesy act only gets you so far.looking back at your past candidacies i also noticed a few things. one of those being that you had to record your csm watch interview for csm 10 twice due to having a panic attack in the middle of the interview. is your nervousness and awkwardness around people something that would be an issue working with the community and ccp being that this is a very public position?i also noticed you are part of b4r as a moderator. i asked around since i don't spend a lot of time in those communities and was told that you love virtual hugs, kisses and cookies. i also heard of more than one instance that you have banned people from there for using 'bad words'. is this something you stand by given eve is such a dark game?you said in your talking in stations interview that you want to give back to the community since people have been so nice and helpful to you. you mention 'you feel you'd be good at it'. do you think that is enough of a reason? it feels like you could have done other things with the time you've put into your csm candidacies that would have been more useful than running over and over. i'm trying to work out why you keep running. what are you going to be able to effect on ccps road map since they never change the whole road map because a csm asks for it?i'm not a hater and i'm sorry if this came off as that. i'm just piecing things together and not seeing a very good picture at the moment as someone who did vote for you last year. i'd like to hear your answers. i'd probably be more interested to hear your reasoning with these questions in voice rather than in text which you have said you would rather people use primarily, which mainly gives you time to think and rethink your answers.-edit to be more friendly"
2/28/2017,"thank you for your questions!to first point out about the 'gamer girl' bit. i want to clear this: i do not like the term 'gamer girl' - and when you hear my talking in stations interview, i actually cringed when materall brought it up asking how me being a girl effected me - but i answered anyways because i'm not wanting to turn down a question, i also mentioned in the interview how i dislike the term. to me, it doesn't matter if you are male of female, we all play together as a whole. i do admit that during interviews i do get a little bit 'giggly' but that is also my nervousness and anxiety kicking in. this happens to me irl as well - it is a hurdle that i have to try to overcome - but i can assure that once i am over that hurdle of interviews - it's a whole other ballgame and i am a very hard worker and focused.this is the same for the csm watch interviews - anxiety and panic came over me on top of hearing difficulties - it was pretty much a disaster and i wish it would have went better. so i have nothing really much to say on that bit other than jumping over that hurdle to overcome this. despite the anxiety and panic ridden interviews, i am 100% confident that once i can get past the interviews/debates/ect, i will have no issues working with ccp and doing the job at hand. i am hearing impaired, however, i do not feel that will hinder me from being able to still do the work - i just may have to ask someone to repeat sometimes if i don't catch something.i am a moderator for b4r, yes, but i also do a lot more than just virtual hugs and cookies - a lot of my time on there is also spent listening to people and just being there for people who need it. there is a lot more to that. in regards to banning, i first have to say on the note of b4r, it is a channel that is held to a higher standard because of the nature of the community. but with that said however, it takes a lot more than a few 'bad words' for me to actually ban someone - and anyone who knows me can vouch for me on that regards.the reason i keep running? because this is something that i want to do. yes i want to give back to the community. being a part of the community has helped me so much - from when i first joined and having people taking the time to help me out, to being able to actually open up more. before i came to eve, i was basically a hermit - i would never talk on voice unless absolutely needed because i used to get anxious just at the idea of speaking - but being with this community has dome something for me - it's changed me for the better. i can't explain it. i went from being a quiet fly on the wall to being someone that sometimes my own corp mates have to tell me to shut up. so yes, i want to give back to the community that has done so much for me - and having this opportunity to be able to do this as a voice for the community that i love would mean a lot to me. so this is why i will keep running and won't give up despite the hurdles that i have to go through. i also feel that my reason is good enough - i feel that i am knowledgeable about the game to be able to provide the feedback to ccp. i also look at things differently, and by that, meaning accessibility. i go over in my head how things can be improved or worked on to better be accessible to other players of other walks of life. i feel that this type of mindset would be very valuable - it's also a area that has never had any real representation. i also feel this answer goes over how i would be able to provide constructive feedback for ccp as they progress through the road-map.i am also more than willing to talk on voice and i also frequent eve radio's public ts at voice.gamingradio.net if you wish to join to get to know me a little bit more.thank you!"
2/28/2017,"if you're still as soap-opera level pitiful as i remember you being, then i would be absolutely floored if you could slam your honeybaked ham hands against the keyboard into microsoft notepad, somehow congealing your whining, derivative-authority rambling manifestos into a single coherent thought.i would rather vote republican."

2/28/2017,you mentioned citadels need to be looked at.what about citadels do you feel needs to be addressed. and what is your opinion on the dps cap on citadels?
2/28/2017,"at that point, perhaps asking if any of what they are working on can coincide with working on pi. ill be honest, i don't code, nor know how to, but i can only imagine that there are things, even if little and non time consuming, that could be done at the same time with little to no loss in productivity on the primary project."
2/28/2017,"well, in my experience the squeaky wheel gets the grease. so with that being said, if it gets brought up enough times, something will happen, either they say nope, not going to work on it or they say they will. the best way to get things done is for it to be on the forefront of thought. looking forward, if elected, i will push at every opportunity possible to excel these points. though at the same time having the understanding that it may not be within the first week or month, it may take 3 months or more. but it would be something that i would bring up consistently."
2/28/2017,"you've got my vote, sir."
2/28/2017,"you read that right.every player wants a deeper experience in the game. it is my goal to encourage that to become a reality. i want to work towards making all aspects of eve more challenging and more rewarding. pve players want more content. industrial players want more complexity and more options. pvp players want to be able to expand their fitting prowess. let's work to expand the sandbox.1. lets make the higher tier industrial aspects of the game more complex.2. increase the risk in pve. dread anoms, titan anoms. make it a challenge.3. bring proper equity to the mining ships. 14b isk ships should be bringing in the same ratio of ore that a 25m isk ship does.i<U+FFFD>m not afraid to speak up and say what<U+FFFD>s on everyone's mind. i<U+FFFD>m not intimidated by anyone and i think that what<U+FFFD>s right and in the best interest of the game and the player base is what is most important. i don<U+FFFD>t believe that one person or group is more important than another, but i also believe that the game should not be modified because someone has found a way to effectively excel at the game.lets talk about what you want eve to become for you, and get to work making it a reality."
2/28/2017,dancul has raised very interesting points and i for one am sure that he's the right man for the job.
2/28/2017,the reason this trash should never be anywhere near cfcsm of ccpl.do not vote for this piece of *snip* people. boycott cfcsm election entirely until even ccpl realizes something is wrong.
2/28/2017,is there a candidate anywhere in known space that can speak for ?
