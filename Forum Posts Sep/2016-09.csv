9/1/2016,"would like to throw my hat into the ring. not my first rodeo. my viewpoints on this matter fall somewhere in between the gank community and the carebears. there is room for both. i would caution this though. the rift between the two entities is very large. consensus will require level heads and well thought out solutions.max civil discourse is uniquely human. after all, when is the last time a pride of lions and a herd of water buffalo negotiated sov over a watering hole? never. someone either gets their ass kicked or eaten. at the end of the day someone holds sov."

9/1/2016,"and so what? he may be uninformed. but usually it's easy enough with a good attitude to get into contact with the ganker and ask him wtf happened and how he did it. many gankers are helpful players and will tell a new player what to look out for and how to prepare.there may be a little roleplay involved now and then, but omg, this is an mmorpg after all.that's what many gankers are actually willing to do. and you know what? quite a few of them are industrialists too. all the new player has to do is get a hold of himself and get in touch with the folks who peeled him out of his trit can.we don't need new game mechanics so much besides maybe what zappity stated earlier. what we do need though, is much improved information for new players about the nature of the game. ccp has been constantly failing at this since i started playing. just look at what they did(n't do) with evelopedia."

9/2/2016,"hi guys.i'd like to return once again to the topic of neural remaps. i think lots of pilots would agree that 1 remap per year is not enough. when you make a remap to save some time training a couple of very long skills, you get stuck with it for the rest of the year. this gives you no incentive to train skills you need right now if they depend on different attributes. so you have to defer them and defer your fun flying ships you want. it's dissappointing and it's not fun.i know there're threads about buying bonus remaps for aurum, and about ditching whole attributes system. but i'd like to propose an alternative.i suggest giving an ability to players to get bonus remaps as a reward for ingame activity.i suggest introducing a new kind of missions which will be:- available once in every 3 months (just like epic arc)- available in high, low and npc null secutity sectors- impossible to blitz- very hard to do solo (make it a real challange for a small gang of 4-6 pilots)- have no or very little isk reward- have a bonus remap as a reward for a pilot who started a mission with no ability to share it with the fleet.bonus remap is a very good incentive for a pilot to do anything. i invision pilots who really need bonus remap to persuade their friends to help them get it (or to hire a fleet of mercenaries).this will add some not isk oriented pve which will be very popular(even with hardcore pvp players), because everyone need remaps."
9/3/2016,"i tell my new players to stick with it and use the circumstances that the war creates to figure out methods to mitigate its effect by adapting. i set them up for it so they aren't unprepared financially and they can take a few hits and through some trial and error most gain the experience they need. now they hardly care if a wardec comes along. they simply adapt and continue with whatever they want to do.difference with a lot of fresh corps run by new players is that i got the experience to teach my new players and they dont. but from my experience it ultimatly comes down to an individuals attitude towards the situation they find themselves in. i recruit my guys based on this attitude so it helps greatly. but i've had some that slipped in that didnt have the right attitude and untill they change its hard on them dealing with wars.the op initially not wanting to drop his corp tells me he got the right idea. he just needs to stick with it and get himself into a position to be able to try some things and figure out what works. we all been there so we can relate. most wt popping a noob will explain how/why etc. it happened if you ask.anyway, wars are good. it matures players into better ones."
9/3/2016,"i concur.reading the old threads on the same topic with the arguments from some of the ""pros"", their argument seem to mainly fall in the category that it would favor the pros/those who have isk/real money to spend.so what we have are basically arguments from people who already have (found) all the optimal settings and tools to skill up optimally anyway. and so the argument becomes in effect /reality: ye, why change if it works for the few? screw the rest. as for the ""pay to win argument"" : as far as i can see it's not at all necessary to make it isk based (pay directly to change it) - and the options are numerous, and there can be no great income for ccp based on the errors of players who err here - on the contrary, it will take them longer time to get to the ship that cost more, and make them spend more on plex to buy more of the ships and module that require higher proficiency and are more expensive. (and income wise its really shooting yourself in the foot as a business if or when you make it more difficult for players to access more expensive ""assets"" anyway, no?)general example: like the skill injectors give larger bonus to the new players w lower skills - new players can be given this option more often or within shorter timeframes,(with greater frequency) based on age / time in game. etc or skillpoints (or whatever other newplayer trait really). at the very least one could give the newer players the option to reset it to a ""flat line"" if they find their mistakes have been too grieveous.while this mechanic heavily penalizes the mistakes of the new player, it's benefits is equal for all after a while when optimized, or like i said: could be nerfed as skillpoints, game time is increasing, thus not giving any extra advantages to ""the pros"". as it is it just augments the pros already enormous head start.as it is it's just one gigantic penalty to the new player and a huge punishment for his or her lack of knowledge/insight/time in game or stupidity if you will (mine included there in i'll happily admit).for those who never tinker much with the mechanic and just set the standard settings it is of course of little to no consequence, but already people with tons of isk can buy ourouborus modules, skill injectors etc. so harping on about how ""dangerous"" extra remaps (even just or enhanced for new players mostly) are - is really a completely mute point at this stage. a skill injector cancels out and far exceeds any benefit even a once a month remap the first year could _ever_ add. isk income, proficiency, experience and the wallet already rules supreme in all of this domain.

9/4/2016,"to be fair, if you're making that argument you should probably stop abusing the ellipsis, too... op: do you want ""meaningful"" pve content or meaningful pve content?"
9/4/2016,"he's right. the main problem is, that except for the epic arcs there are no ""great"" stories in eve. i very fast stopped the wall of text for missions, because there are no important informations. i think there should be more stories and modern missions with animations, voice etc.why not ditch new players into a story that will take them month of skilling to fulfill? maybe with triggers, when he reaches the needed stats to complete them and with meaningful choices. not just shooting x snakes but decisions. that's a maine part of the success of the witcher that you have to make choices!"

9/7/2016,"first, the space the op proposes already exists as its illegal to even bother new players in rookie systems along with a few other specialized places. so, great! you've already got it.second, ganking is pretty rare in most .8 - 1.0 systems as concord is pretty fast. the people getting ganked in the trade hubs are not new players but rather, greedy players who undock with their life's savings in an untanked industrial. these people need to be destroyed so its not helpful to anyone to give them some immunity.third, and this is the big one. if ccp made .8 - 1.0 systems relatively immune to ganking you wouldn't be able to get near the asteroids for all the veterans hoovering up all the ore. there would be even more massive bot fleets of mining ships than there already are working the relative safety of the highest security system. its why the ice isn't there. the new player in his venture or retriever wouldn't get a full cycle off before his rock disappears. and if you don't like the guys taking all the ore before you can get any? tough! you can't wardec them because they are all in npc corps and you can't gank them because its against the ""rules"". the one thing you didn't really cover in your rather lengthy idea is why anything needs to be changed to make things safer. danger is the nature of eve and the sooner a player realizes that the better chance he has of becoming a long term player. frankly, anyone who actually needs to be protected while playing in a significant portion of game space probably is going to quit once they venture into a scary .7 system and sees someone flashing red. don't coddle the kids. they need to learn to fight for what they get in eve. by choosing to mine in new order systems, highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct. www.minerbumping.com"
9/7/2016,"i'm answering this in a separate post because as clunky as the op's idea was it was sincere and deserved a polite answer, even if contradictory.but this! this deserves nothing but derision. it shows a complete misunderstanding of what the new order (or code. which is only part of the no) stands for, what it does and how its funded.please. shoot the miners. if they die its because they aren't following the code as we instructed them. clear out all those players who bought permits thinking they could return to their afk, max yield mining habits. if you kill them first, you save us the expense of a catalyst to do it ourselves. and the loss of our mining permit fees? oh heavens! how will we ever get by without our 10 million isk payments? why without those we will have to fall back on our trillions of donations received from code supporters across all of eve. or the trillions of loot that drop from the freighters, mining ships and afk plex toting shuttles we blap daily. at this rate we would be out of business in mere decades.as for the highsec miners. they are already damned if they do and damned if they don't. they choose to flying target ships in a pvp game. they choose to delay fun now for some sort of fantasy fun they think they will have ""once they get enough isk together to get into pvp."" the only way to win at mining is to not do it. whether you kill them or i kill them, they are just as dead. some portion of them will eventually decide to fight. if history is any predictor, they will decide to fight for us. by choosing to mine in new order systems, highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct. www.minerbumping.com"
9/7/2016,"many miners are against requiring the rorq/orca to be on grid and provide boosts to only those ships withing a certain distance.not posting here to argue the pros and cons, simply want to know if there's even one current csm member who will talk to ccp against this proposal.thanks."

9/7/2016,
9/8/2016,still remember!
9/8/2016,"many miners are against changes that put ships in space and expose them to the risk of exploding. these people are unreasonably risk averse. why should i be able to invest in an orca + pos and get a risk-free bonus to mining yield? it's a once-off cost that makes mining better. that's bad gameplay, and it's why ccp is removing it."
9/8/2016,"as stated, this post wants to know if any csm member will talk to ccp against the orca/rorqual boosting proposal, not rehash the pros and cons.miners are far from risk averse - we risk a great deal every day by putting squishy non-combat assets on the field. it's not risk aversion, it's risk management and under the proposal there is no way to adequately manage the risk of fielding a rorqual. you cannot asses the risk to the rorq when it will be subject to attack by an opponent that could be of any number and variety, meaning you cannot adequately predict and prepare a defense fleet to meet all comers. in a pos the rorqual isn't at risk, but neither is it receiving a benefit itself from boosting. in fact, it's using heavy water at a decent rate to run the core costing its operator isk. the rorq owner's mining toons may be receiving the benefit, but they're at risk.how much risk do station traders accept? industrialists?but back to the point, is there a csm member that will speak up to ccp against the proposed mining boosts changes?"
9/8/2016,the new system is boosters on the grid so there is nothing the csm can/will do. i will grant you that the mining system needs a twist to make it worth it to risk the rorq but ongrid boosters are out of reach for the csm. someone on reddit made a calculation that it's not worth to us a rorq for mining if you calculate the risks of loosing it. he came up with about 8-10 hour constant core to get even in null!!!
9/8/2016,"since the new system is still in the upcoming state it would seem that the csm could discuss the impact it will have on miners with ccp. even if it was already in place, they could voice the issues miners are raising."
9/8/2016,"risk vs reward, if you feel that its not worth the risk of putting a rorqual in to give boosts+ what ever extra it can also mine its self then you don't do it , you must feel that the mining amount is fine without the extra risk involved. some (not all miners have to use it) will feal that the risk is worth it and they will use it. some people don't feel its worth the risk using t2 barges over t1 and that is up to them.... other will and will then get to use it and will get the benifit of doing so....you are looking for all the benefits of using a rorqual without any risk...."
9/8/2016,there are safe bets which prob don't make that much isk and then theirs long term market speculation which could go ether way they could make loads or loose everything... just like rl traders.indi people risk things all the time.. like loosing freighters full of stuff... its all part of the risk of doing it and some times they make bank and some times they loose all there stock.you are asking for a ??? 35%? mining boost to every single person in your fleet with zero risk.pvp fleets will also have to risk there command ships on grid now with the changes (some fitted and mindlinked command ships cost just as much as a rorqual does)... the fleet could deside its not worth the risk and not run links or they could take the chance and use them.

9/9/2016,as someone who has only recently begun to organize against high sec ganking i am interested in the outcome even if i am not yet qualified by results to participate. if my point of view as to why players need to organize against high sec faux pvp is helpful then yes i'd like to attend.
9/9/2016,"forum tears!another cry baby ganker, this one is one who always whines in every thread.attacking those who pay extortion and those who request it will likely become very popular once the alphas hit, industrialists will weed out those who are not helping against the blight of high sec faux pvp. war decs are also a reasonable and more honorable way to discourage people from kneeling to extortionists. the game is going to get more interesting when the alphas change the balance upon arrival."
9/9/2016,"erm we do.... it's called pandemic horde. now i am not saying the op is not dumb and unless he has an idea for making it better he should just stfu... but well yes he is and he should.missions are very dull, your never going to be able to make it super exciting but dam anything thing that makes it more dynamic than warping into the same spot and killing the rats in the same order every single time because every mission is the same every single time would be good. even doing the scanner exploration game thing at least is a bit dynamic. i have no idea how it could be fixed but people that live in empire are the only real people that are propping up ccp's bank to a point that they can keep the servers running and i do think more needs to be done to help them.."
9/9/2016,"he's simply stating that in a fleet you have the rest of the fleet to defend your expensive ships, which is not the case in a mining fleet. it's also that the amount of risk/reward must be good on a money making activity. how high are your chances to loose your ratting carrier? and do you have to nail it down for 5 minutes to get it do his work?imho this is a perfect example for the limited fitting options on mining ships. a fleet can now equip boosts in spare slots on frontline ships, which mining ships just don't have, or use a dedicated booster ship. mining fleets don't have any options.i'm all in for boosters on grid but the mining fleets have different options then normal fleets and ccp has to target this problem."
9/9/2016,"1: a fleet does not always defend against alpha and just haveing your links vaporised2: why can the mining fleet not defend, does not sound like a fleet to me3: why does the risk reward have to be good/better than something like a pvp fleet where there is no real incentive other than kill mails, your reward is you get stuff. out of thin air, and you can calculate almost to the 0.01isk how much reward you are getting for doing something for 10mins 1h 10h 10 days. what other activity can you calculate the rewards so accurately? you can also calculate a worst case scenario where you send the whole fleet out to mine, you get nothing and all get wiped out, you can also calculate to the nearest 3mins exactly how long you have to mine to 100% pay for everything in the fleet. i don't think there is anything you can do in this game to make isk that you can calculate the risk-reward so accurately.using a rorqual to give bonuses has the same risk as using a dread, you know how much the ship is worth. and just the same as a dread all you are gaining by using one is time.... and time is the one thing you can calculate when mining and can also calculate how long you need to mine with the rorqual boosts to pay for the risk of losing it. you can then calculate the likely hood of some fleet coming that you cannot deal with and then work out if its worth it.4: only a few ships can use links not all of them. no one is forcing you to use a rorqual to run links... you can also just stick some mining links on a ferox.. just like a pvp fleet could put their links on a ferox to lower the cost risk of losing them vs a vulture or something. you can have lower cost links which boost less or you can risk more and get more... all very simple and nothing that a pvp fleet cannot or does not do. also most pvp people don't have links trained so even if you were someone like pl you cannot just run a command ship fleet and say hay every single one of our ships has links now because it just does not work that way. you will always have to have dedicated people flying dedicated ships that cannot really do much other than boost. at least the rorqual has more roles than just give boosts while its there... it can support other ships with reps it can mine stuff out of thin air (just like the rest of the miners).... it makes isk on its own, which also reduces the risk reward for using it. you are in the mind set still that a rorqual does nothing but run links but they do so so so much more, even now they can do more stuff than just run links and when the command changes come in they will be able to do loads loads loads more than just sit there running links.pvp fleet: hay we could use these dreads to kill xxx but if we get dropped they will prob die... or we can take some battleships it will take longer but there is less risk of been dropped and if we do get dropped we might be able to save some of the ships.we could use x and get z compleated in 10mins or we can use y and it will take 15minsmining fleet: hay we could use a rorqual to boost but if we get dropped it will prob die... or we can just run links on xxx (or no links) we will have to mine a bit longer but there is less risk of been dropped and if we do get dropped we might be able to save some of the ships.we could use a rorqual for links and we will make xxx in 30mins or we could use this ferox for links but we will have to mine for 6.216546% longer to make the same isk."
9/9/2016,pvp fleet are for fun not for making money. you have to compare with ratting or mission running. a mining fleet can't defend ships because they don't have weapons!and how high are the chances that your dread gets nailed when it has to be 8+h on the grid to be worth it...........
9/9/2016,erm pl run pvp fleets for making money all the time. #merclifejust like ratting and mission running sometimes it is not worth the extra risk of using more expensive ships/fittings to just earn 1-10% more isk per tick which is why people use things like vni's for doing it and don't use officer fit t2 bs'sa 20bill isk mission running ship cannot really defend against been ganked either but some people still do it as they think its worth the 2% more isk per tic over something that is less likely to get ganked. it seems you don't feel its worth the risk.... so don't use one.... use something else that's in your price range to run the links and because of the lower risk you get less isk... its really really simple maths.saying your special snowflakes and mining is nothing like the rest of the game in any way so you need your own special rules to make it fair on you is just dumb.you want to field capital ships. you want to field capital ships that give ?35-50%? boosts to other ships that make isk and can also mine its self and make isk.you want to field capital ship that make isk and boost others isk making with no support and no risk.you want to field a capital ship that can make isk boost others isk remote rep others that are making isk and rep people who are trying to support it and that can also put a special shield around others making isk and has the tank of a triage which even some alliances in this game would not be able to brake and have no risk to using it?would you also like ccp to reduce the skill cap and build costs of it as well? because i think this ability should be available to even new people to the game.
9/9/2016,"a superficial assessment of risk management with respect to the rorqual. sure, some will solo mine in a rorqual, but anecdotal nonsense doesn't make it good risk management.what we're looking for is a change to the rorqual that makes risk management sense - not a panic button. if it has to be on grid, it needs to be able to fully boost without the industrial core running. it needs to be able to move when necessary, not just when able.the changes we were hoping for the rorq had more to do with the clone vat, ore compression, and current trait benefits that didn't mean much. not this.those who operate rorqs risk a great deal with respect to their mining toons. too bad if that's not enough for you.but, i'll say it again, this post is simply asking if any csm member is going to talk to ccp about the mining boost changes on behalf of miners. those who want to argue the merits need to go to the dev blog thread."
9/9/2016,"maybe you should lead with we are hoping it gets a tweek to the clone vat ore compression and stuff when the rorqual is been looked at as at the moment these bonuses are not really used in modern eve. rather than starting with we don't want them on grid for boosts.... thats all you asked for in your op.and like i said you don't have to use a rorqual for boosts there are 17 other ships that you can use to give boosts, they are a lower boost amount but cost less than 1/10 the price of a rorqual. just like no one forced that guy that died today in a 15-20bill isk officer fitted mission running ship for his 3% more dps and income.i mean whats wrong with the panic shield? does it need to last longer? does it need more range? does it need to use less fuel to activate? maybe you could diversify members in your corp/alliance so there are people that like to pvp also so you have some back up... or maybe make some other frends outside of your corp/alliance just like everyone elce does.... even people that fight you might be willing to help if a 3rd party come.... just like pandemic horde today helped nc. (who every day kill horde members) with a thing. or the time any one helped any one else in this mmo.i mean if all it comes down to is you don't like to have to siege to boost why not just use an orca? thats cheaper, provides some level of command boosts, is moveable, not sieged i would love if pl could use titans as command ships all the time to get there dank boosts, but we cannot as its not worth the risk for the extra... so do you know what we do... we don't take the risk and go with a lower level command ship and miss out on the benefits. i would also love if i could build a 30bill isk kronos and then go use it with a very low risk, but thats not possible...people used to be able to out run missiles in hacs and now they cannot... miners used to be able to have 100% safe links and not you cannot. you also used to be able to aoe dd with a titan without the titan even been in the same system. and now you can not... things change, every one is in the same boat. all miners have the same problem... some will risk it and maybe they get mad bank or maybe they all die, some people will not risk it and will have to settle for a lower mining amount"
9/9/2016,"it's not completely clear to me why the rorqual's fleet boosting role needs to be tied to the seige mode (or whatever it's called, i forget). no other boosting ship suffers this limitation."
9/9/2016,"nor do i, and yes that element seems a little off... but the op was only asking for a csm to plead the case of 1: why does it have to be in a belt to boost and 2: only in a set km range of the rorqual when its in the belt."
9/9/2016,"i'm more than happy to play devils advocate, and i can agree not all parts of the change are perfect in my view (and hopefully we can hammer those out), but i can't in good conscience say i will ""oppose"" the changes. if your goal here is to have ccp scrap the changes, that won't happen. if your goal is to have your voice and opinion expressed at the summit then you are in luck... send me a well worded in game mail and we can go from there."
9/9/2016,"it is a sad commentary on the role of the csm and the way players vote when a large block of players can at best hope for someone on the csm to play ""devil's advocate"" on their behalf.although i sincerely thank you for being willing to represent players who would otherwise have no voice on the csm, i think the fact that the csm has no permanent voice of industrialists onboard is structurally a weakness.perhaps you might suggest to ccp that players should have category choices to vote for csm members, high sec, pve, pvp, low sec, null sec, rp, industrialist, anoikis, fw, and so on. getting an actual cross section of what players do in eve would/could serve the players, the csm, and ccp much better.judge, your opinion is valued since you are the only member of the csm to respond to this request for representation in this thread."
9/9/2016,"or maybe members of the csm have taken on board that something might need a look at but feel on the whole it doesn't require such a long discussion, and how do you even know that industrialists aren't represented? just because somebody is in a pvp alliance does not mean that they also don't run large industrial jobs, or small industrial jobs or mine or station trade or any of the other industrial type activities."
9/9/2016,"does the concept of stakeholder groups having seats at the csm table scare you that much? exactly what are you afraid of? is it the concept of people being represented by people who share their interests?somehow i suspect there might be some difference in point of view from a full time industrial player and a pvp null sec alliance fc that perhaps, possibly does some mining from time to time.perish forbid the thought that an industrialist might actually add something to the mix of fresh ideas, right?"
9/9/2016,"interesting that the high sec gankers are the biggest opponents of this change of restricting production only to lower security space, where they never go.sounds like they are tearing up because the use of boosters will make their targets a little tougher to gank in the time they have before concord kills them. they are afraid a little risk might be injected into their current sure thing.their forum tears are quite interesting. obviously anything that might offset their balancing act scares the hell out of them. towards that end i am going to distribute drugs that boost shields in systems that have a high gank kill total and see if we can rebalance the scales. going to build a lot of warp stabs also, giving them as gifts/ deterrents will cause a little ripple.one of the good thing about being a builder, i can decide to gift anything i can make, and trust me that is a lot.i will post a thread on the results if we can get ganks to fail more often. making it a little more dangerous in high sec for gankers fits right inline with eve philosophy, or at least as it should be, no guaranteed results when you undock, just risk, danger, and the possibility of getting what you want done."

9/10/2016,"need to get some feedback on this proposal, especially from csm members.dmc"
9/10/2016,"i think you are forgetting that some of the larger scale pvp alliances have massive industrial infrastructure backing them up.in pl we have teams of people who do nothing but the industrial side of things, mercenary coalition back in the day were a huge industrial machine able to produce everything they ever needed from mining the ore and moon goo to the construction of the titans,, hundreds and thousands of people working together for an alliance. yes there are people out there that do nothing but industry and are not on the csm but that does not mean their voices are not represented. how miners mine can have very big consequences to the way alliances like pl or goons operate.even if a csm member is a null sec alliance fc does not mean that he is not privy to the information of industrial activities and would not have advisers in those types of thing.some might say that the people that only do industry and have no real contact with pvp alliances are at the disadvantage in being able to balance things not the other way round"
9/10/2016,i think it would be reasonable to bring back mining signatures with these changes.
9/10/2016,"standing fleet to respond to your panicked calls, even if they are ratting? watching local? intel systems? the ~4.5 hour payback on the rorqual investment isn't that long and should be part of your calculations. anyway, i seem to recall pressing the <U+FFFD>siege<U+FFFD> button on my moros yesterday. i got really good value in the form of a ten-fold increase in dps and paid for it with being stuck in place for a few minutes. having said that, i don't really understand why boosting is the effect of the rorqual's siege cycle. why not give the ship immense mining yield for the duration of the cycle? no other boosting ship suffers the penalty of immobility. a direct mining yield would 'feel' much better for the user."
9/10/2016,will do.thanks.
9/10/2016,"i honestly think that industrialists do have a voice on this csm, be it members like myself who are yes, in a large nullsec alliance, but also help manage massive industrial production and mining, or members like steve in high sec or sullen who put together the industrial capital round table (aimed at talking about the changes to mining boosts mainly). i wouldn't be too hard on the other csm's for not replying because in all honesty they probably haven't seen the thread. i arrived in iceland on thursday (4 days before the summit starts) while most of the other csm members are either traveling as i type or getting ready to leave their homelands to come to this volcanic rock in the middle of the ocean.everyone deserves a voice. we all play eve. people shouldn't get too tied down to ""where"" the person is from but rather how well they can listen and communicate so as to represent you, as a player and customer, properly."
9/10/2016,"some might say the exact opposite is what we have now and it does not work very well for industrialists. so we can choose between your hypothetical and the in game current reality, easy choice for me, but i respect your right to search for explanations that will reinforce your conclusions."
9/10/2016,"i appreciate your response. i do not hold it against the other csm members, i simply am glad you were tuned in. you speak of the massive industrial needs of the big alliances which all industrialists who play the game know has to exist. the culture in game acts as if industrial production is not an integral part of the game design. perhaps if some on the csm spoke out against this false premise and articulated that industrialists play an important role beyond beind easy targets industrialists would feel represented.since that is not yet the majority stated position of the current csm i think a system that would insure that players who primarily focus on industrial game play could have a designated position on the csm would serve the game and all it's players better."
9/10/2016,"i hope the csm has a very productive summit. it is an exciting time to be involved in this game, changes are coming fast, and some are making things better. i have confidence that overall the csm shares my desire to make the game better where ever they can and i support their efforts to balance all the multiple communities of interest that compose the eve player universe. i am optimistic that a better system of representation will one day be implemented and be more reflective of the diverse community of players and play styles."
9/10/2016,"can we have ship module ""show info"" with hover over icons similar to those shown against the module in market view.the market view states whether a module selected can be fitted to the active ship with sufficient cpu/power grid.the show info view does not, seems a small ask.cheers"
9/11/2016,"another mechanic that creates many frustrating situations without adding meaningful complexity or positive gameplay.having to travel 30+jumps in an interceptor so you can buy a skill, having to clonejump to highsec and be stuck there for 20 hours, or having to wait for somebody to bring you the skills from highsec with the next jf run, so you are able to actually play the game, is not ""meaningful choice"" nor ""creating content""; it's only frustrating and un-fun.integrate the skill market straight in the character sheet. add a ""buy skill"" button on every skill, and detract the amount of isk from the wallet. voil<U+FFFD>, you've just fixed another ""feature"" apparently designed to kick the newbie in the teeth and burn out the veteran player. this kind of procedures create the ""eve learning cliff"", not the complexity of the mechanics or the gameplay. let's work to turn that cliff into a curve."
9/11/2016,"jump clone fatigue is a feature that creates many situations where the smart move is not to play the game. just a few examples-want to enjoy a little pve in the morning, but if i clone jump i won't be at the staging for tonight's fleet... i'll just play overwatch instead.-doing an exploration run on the other end of the cluster. ping pops up to get in fleet. if i go i'll be unable to come back here and keep exploring... crap; i'll have to get in fleet but just log off after the op. because what i really want to do now is exploration, not ratting. and i'm 19 hours away of jumping back to my exploration ship....-want to help the newbros in lowsec learn some pvp. again, if i clonejump there i won't be here for tonight's coalition-wide operation. sorry, newbros.i understand unlimited, free clonejump has issues, but the current system has the biggest issue possible: people not playing the game at times because of it."
9/11/2016,"""honorable"" lol.if many highsec residents can't be bother to even tank their industrial ships (or do one of the many other things that make you near invulnerable in highsec with only a tiny amount of effort) or even pay attention to their eve client, what makes you think they will start using alpha clones to start attacking other players? and if they do and are successful, they will be attacking other industrialists who are not following the new halaima code of conduct (even if they have a permit) as bing described above which means they are effectively doing the new order's work. players that follow the code are immune to attack and thus have nothing to fear from such actions. do you see now why the code always wins? best we get you set up with a permit now and get you compliant if you are planning to start a career enforcing the code on an alpha clone. once you have that, we can give you some tips on how best to gank or wardec industrialists to get you started.but as to the op: no. new players already have the rookie systems to learn the interface and get started on the game. if you want to expand that, or add some expanded protected area as part of a new npe i have no problem with that as long as it is completely economically useless (or even walled off) to existing veteran players. that means no rewards whatsoever that will affect the greater eve economy. no industry, no missions, no anomalies, no player-owned stations, no ore, no trading - nothing. any content there cannot reward anything of real value outside of that space and only should exist to train true new players. highsec is already saturated with veteran players abusing concord protection to gather resources and do industry. even safer space to hide in will just result in risk-avoiding veteran players moving in and out-competing the new players for the resources there."

9/12/2016,"it's up to the csm to bring ""neglected subjects"" to ccp's attention. it's up to the players to let csm members know what they think is neglected."
9/12/2016,"the item i would like to propose is a security log of who took control of citadel weapons, or who accessed certain hangars either in stations or in citadel.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
9/12/2016,"i'm sorry that this is somewhat of a duplicate post (in another forum), but someone really should sticky a post indicating the areas that each csm member is more focused on. i didn't know which csm member to send this to. feel free to redirect this thread as needed.let's face it, the game mechanics for weapon accuracy and damage are not obvious for new players, and even many that are not so old. and even if you understand those mechanics, it is still difficult to know whether your weapons are doing maximum damage while in the heat of battle because there are too many factors for which to account. projectile weapons:range - optimal, falloff and out of rangetracking speed (radians per second) versus transversal speed of targetmissile weapons:flight range versus range/vector of targetexplosion radius versus signature radius of targetexplosion velocity versus velocity of target of target(that is a lot of information for a person to memorize, recall, and estimate while doing everything else.)in the end, it always comes down to comparing predetermined sets of data. is the target too far, too fast, or too small?that's basically all that the player needs to worry about. (yes, i know can be a bit more complex than that, but it is close enough.) my idea is that there should be an optional visual aid added around weapon module icons in the hud. here is a hasty example:weapon effectiveness indicatorsif something like that (but less ugly) were used, it would drastically reduce the amount of confusion that new players experience while in combat. all they would have to do is look at the module to understand how effective the weapon will be against the target."
9/13/2016,"this comment makes me longing for a ""don't like"" button."
9/13/2016,"wardecs are fine, they just don't follow the paradigm of eve at all - with risk brings opportunity for reward. without a mechanic for the defender to force an end to the war outside of surrendering, the best bet for wardeccers is simply to have 300+ active decs at all times. for example, if you needed to have a citadel mod that could only be fitted to fortizars or higher for your wardecs to be active, deccers would have some skin in the game and deccing couldn't be so capricious, as there may actually be a consequence to the war. with nothing to defend, and no commitments, the mechanic is just lame. get some skin in the game!"
9/14/2016,"missions that work against main factions are just a pain if your are not running for the pirate factions. mission runners avoid them like cancer and they are a good way for noobs to shoot their standing to hell. they really don't serve for anything because the loss of standing to one faction outweights any increase on the other side. to get standing up again is a boring grind.even shooting the standing to hell in fc war doesn't really serve any means because you most likely have another char that is doing work you can't do yourself anymore. and after the fc war you need the long grind to get faction standing up again. where is the fun in doing x level one missions when you can easily do level 4? it's just a grind to get free from the faction police.capsuleers are mercenaries lorewise and everyone knows that these will fight you one day to help you out the next: no real bad feelings.maybe the csm could look into this part of the game, which is just annoying in every way without really creating roleplaying content. and i don't count agents simply not talking to you as content."
9/14/2016,you... you can just not do them?
9/14/2016,"good idea if you know what they are doing to your standing, but why are they here when 99,9% of all players avoid them like plague for good reasons? teasing noobs?"
9/14/2016,"i don't know, wasn't ccp affinity musing last year that she didn't think standings were consequential enough and that you shouldn't be able to be positive with all the factions? it doesn't seem like there are many 'consequences' for your slaughtering of thousands of npcs to benefit one of the empires as it is. seems like a better solution is to only allow anti-faction missions in highsec so that players have to make consequential choices of who they side with. it makes sense that the empires would be more concerned with battling their neighbours than sending capsuleers off on police or anti-pirate duty. and how do these npc pirates get into highsec anyways when i infallibly have the faction police on me seconds after entering >=0.5 security system? if you want to fight pirates in anti-pirate missions, you should have to go to lowsec closer to where they live to get these missions."
9/14/2016,"why not, but you need much better options to raise your faction standing again. the problem is the inparity in gaining/loosing faction standing. if you could raise it as fast as loose there would be no big problem. but for noobs with just one char most of the trade hubs will be unaccessable and they will be quickly killed by any gate gun. what wouldn't be a big problem for vet will be a great problem for noobs."
9/14/2016,what about tags and lp stores without antifaction missions ?
9/14/2016,"geronimo mcvain wrote:why not, but you need much better options to raise your faction standing again. the problem is the inparity in gaining/loosing faction standing. if you could raise it as fast as loose there would be no big problem. but for noobs with just one char most of the trade hubs will be unaccessable and they will be quickly killed by any gate gun. what wouldn't be a big problem for vet will be a great problem for noobs.tags for standings then. i really don't feel strongly either way (although given you can just pass on missions you don't want to run i don't see it as a major issue either), but i got the sense ccp felt that standings should be revamped completely to make them more meaningful as summarized on themittani.com:tmc wrote:content in standingless concrete than the convoys was the discussion on standings. ccp affinity offered her opinion that standings are likely due for a rebalance or removal <U+FFFD>in the next few years,<U+FFFD> but there is not hard timeline for when or even if this will happen. while not likely to herald any changes in the near future, her insight on the matter does show how each part of the game is being looked at for consistency and its ability to generate engaging gameplay. according to ccp affinity, the way the current system allows players to have positive standings with just about everyone at once does not make much sense. a rework would allow for more consequences for actions. factions would team up with or against players, and being beloved by both the amarr and minmatar at once might no longer be possible. besides creating new enemies for players to shoot, this would also allow factions to offer new services to their friends.i'm not sure your idea goes towards that goal but i guess it doesn't hurt to have the csm inquire as to where ccp thinks standings are headed. perhaps once the minutes are out we'll know some more."
9/14/2016,i know full well what they do to standing. i'm one of the 0.5% who prefer being able to make >20b in a few weeks to caring what empire facpo think of me.
9/14/2016,"that's a good point that the op should have a think about. while i tend to agree with black pedro's post and affinity's thoughts, if ccp were to remove all the anti-faction missions they would need to do a big pass on the lp stores as many items need navy insignias."
9/15/2016,"lorewise capsuleers are mercenaries which are paid for a job. so ccp would just have to remove the negative standing effect which would lorewise mean that the main faction accept that there are no ""personal"" aka standing feelings involved. like amaar has no problems with us shooting amaar ships in the purity event.fw or working for pirate factions may be something else lorewise so there the faction standing losses make sense."
9/15/2016,
9/16/2016,actually both are true
9/16/2016,"first of all, the code is flawless so there are no problems with itsecond. wow. i've been ""asked"" to stop thousands of times while bumping miners. i've stopped because someone asked me to, zero. the whole point of bumping someone is to get them to do something they don't immediately agree to. like buy a permit. does it make any sense that it would go down like:me: bump! buy a mining permit!miner: (well, nothing actually because they are afk)me: bump! this is new order territory. all miners must have mining permits and follow the code!miner sits 50 km away from the ice for a while, lasers off, just sitting afk.miner: wha!?!?!me: bump! buy a permit.miner: please stop bumping me. ( i added the please part. they don't actually say please.)me: ok, sorry. see you later.notper ccp, the miner can ""make an effort to move to another location"" and if the bumper follows them it can be harassment. they later clarified this to mean several jumps away. to me several is 20 or more. its never been tested as far as i know. in any case, i've bumped a miner for hours as he obstinately refused to buy a permit and stubbornly kept trying to mine. i know i've had enough petitions filed against me that i have my own little folder at hq up in iceland but i haven't been warned, suspended or banned for bumping someone who asked me to stop.of course now miners dock up when i enter system so there's much less bumping. by choosing to mine in new order systems, highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct. www.minerbumping.com"
9/16/2016,i would vote to keep missions standings like they are right now because they reflect the conflict of new eden but i would add a warning in the mission description or a separate notification about the standings drop.
9/16/2016,
9/17/2016,"even i personally dont give a flying **** about pve and lp stores in global, this seems like logical and legit request. why should some hardcore carebears have access to stuff the other hardcore carebears doesnt? makes no sense whatsoever. on the other hand how many things in eve actually make sense?"
9/17/2016,"i don't think that is the case though, since the only players doing such a thing in the game are anti-ganking and i don't think they get banned for it. they even have a whole channel and website devoted to following us around in highsec no matter where we go. luckily they are pretty bad at the game and have no negative effect on my gameplay, so it does not feel like griefing."
9/17/2016,i don't think that is true. these anti-gankers that you refer to are within their rights to shoot players that are kos or flagged as criminals. did you forget your coffee?
9/18/2016,any notes? (or dare to set an eta on that? :))
9/19/2016,op please understand this as you can see from some of the cynical responses. this is why this cool game has problems getting and keeping new players.. just cause those that be feel the need to keep it harsh and cold and all that bs.i think if you asked the csm how to get players and keep them playing and paying they'd blow their veins out honestly.the wardec system is very broken. it is.. there's loopholes in it which can end up having a regular corp to be endlessly wardec back to back.. all you have to do basically its been broken and they know it. just like other parts in this game are completely broken which gets pushed away cause they just dont know what to deal with.will eve online ever get back up to the numbers she once had? thats the main question everyone is waiting for an answer on.but we all know the answer already just by taking a quick snapshot at its forums most of the time.
9/19/2016,"speaking as a member of a large and relatively solvent alliance, being able to purchase wardec immunity would be extremely convenient for us.what other immunities might we be able to purchase? one example that springs to mind is that many of us have very low gallente and minmatar standings, owing to years of farming angel missions. buying immunity to the faction police would be very handy.also i don't really like having to make isk. it isn't my playstyle and it compromises my freedom. i guess it's ok having to do it once, but i don't see why i should regularly be forced to do something i don't want to. how about if i could purchase immunity from ratting? pay 1b, receive 100m per month income. i'm not greedy; a couple of bill a month would be ample for me."

9/23/2016,"csm,i'm after the summit so this may be after the point and an old topic but i would encourage a look at bumping in eve. please consider: 1. if one were to impact or ram another's vessel in reality it would most certainly be considered a hostile act. 1a. i get it, eve is not reality. 1b. should bumping be a ""concordable"" offense? 2. sometimes people get bumped by friendlies on purpose to help align time. 2a. exempt criminal status when in a fleet with the impacting vessel. 3. sometimes newbro's accidentally bump other players. 3a. can there be a way to have a box pop up that says ""vessel impact detected"" and give options of ""forgive"" or ""report""? 3b. in this way afk players could still be ""coded.""thanks for all you do!joe"

9/25/2016,"this is not just about learning implants.as for the question, ccp probably haven't decided yet.a case by case basis might work when we are talking about ccp intervention. but someone is going to login on a character that used to be an omega, with implants fitted that alphas can't use. then eve's code is going to have to decide what to do on the spot. possible responses include: - let the implant work. give former subscribers an advantage over people who have never subscribed. - leave it plugged in, but non-functional. now the former subscriber needs to decide between destroying the expensive implant or having an implant slot that they can't use. - lock the character. - crash the client. - crash the server.my guess is that the implant will remain operational. punishing people for subscribing is a good way to convince them to never subscribe again. it should be obvious why the last three options are undesirable."
9/26/2016,i will be extremely surprised if the large majority of implants do no continue to work. i would expect the only exception to be some kind of edge case producer scenario where the implants allowed the alpha character to be somehow way too effective at welath generation. no one cares about t1 cruisers having hg slaves or whatever.

9/29/2016,"ganking has no real disincentive. the overall consequence is marginal for the value generated (kb stats, etc.).a few thoughts:increase the criminal flag timer, possibly in a way similar to jump fatigue (ie, on a sliding scale) for high sec attacks. make it substantial so that ""death"" has a consequence in high sec. set it for days for negative sec status players. this would work well with npc corp gankers. the perk here would be that a genuine high sec blunder by newb would have a fairly insubstantial penalty while a habitual criminal would be slowed in his/her frequency to gank. however, the basic gank mechanic would be unchanged. coordinating a gank is not easy.make it cost zero isk to war dec corporations with over all bad security standings. this would work on a meta incentive (corp kb stats) and allow high sec players to proactively attack ganker corps who currently enjoy high sec protections when massing or otherwise performing movements to setup a high sec gank."
9/29/2016,"why should it have a disincentive? new eden was specifically designed as a full-time, pvp sandbox with no safe spaces. why should intended game play be discouraged through disincentives? but regardless, the consequences for being a highsec criminal are extremely harsh, so harsh that most players (at least highsec residents used to their npc-enforced safety) flat out refuse to ever commit a criminal act. the consequences for becoming an outlaw prevent the pirate from doing anything at all in highsec but constantly moving about in small ships: no pve, no other pvp, no resource gathering, or even just acting as a scout in space. even for non-outlaws, illegal aggression earns you a 30-day kill right that forfeits your free, npc-enforced safety blanket which many players are not willing to give up. i would say that is not marginal.what is marginal is the ""value"" you say they earn. killboard stats are not valuable <U+FFFD> they have no direct in-game impact on the game. killmails the same, they are just a record of an event. they may motivate some players, but they have no effect on the game itself. even things of real value in-game, like say the cargo of an overloaded freighter, are not ""generated"" by ganking. those assets are just transferred from one player to another as a consequence of a pvp encounter. this is not just a semantic distinction. risk vs. reward is an important idea to balance resource generation in a single-universe sandbox game. generating resources like isk and minerals into the universe devalues everyone else's resources. balancing the effort and risk of generating things against the risk of loss (and vulnerability to the other players) is necessary to prevent hyperinflation and to give meaning to these industrial activities (and to generate content). piracy has none of these issues <U+FFFD> it only destroys virtual items while creating content. from a purely economic view, it is only a good thing as it stimulates the economy. why should ccp lock out players from playing the game as they intend for it to work? it's doesn't seem wise to straight-out mechanically bar your paying customers from playing the game as you built and sold it to them. if ccp decides they don't want players shooting each other in highsec, wouldn't it be easier to just lock out the ability to illegally activate weapons against other players in highsec? then the pirates could at least go on and do something else in the game other than sit in a station unable to undock for most of their game time. outlaws are already free-to-shoot and enjoy no ""highsec protections"". you don't need a wardec at all <U+FFFD> just go shoot them.this isn't really the thread to rehash the ""one more nerf and it will now be balanced"" debate. the round-table is, i assume over, as is the csm summit. however, i will point out that the existence of highsec piracy is very much intended by ccp. the fact another player can attack you in highsec is not an oversight or exploit, but an intended profession and feature of the game which ccp developers spent significant development time coding into the game. whether or not you think it fair, other players have the option of accepting the consequences of illegal aggression and exploding you and taking your stuff. they can do that for in-game profit, for intangibles like a killboard, as part of a greater sandbox cause, or just for fun. it is up to you to use one of the many tools ccp has given you to protect yourself from them (and this is where you should focus your concerns about ganking if you have any <U+FFFD> the fact you can be attacked is not a problem and completely intentional but if you feel there are not sufficient tools to mitigate and counter those attacks, that would be of valid concern to the game developers). they have deliberately made you content, like they have of all of us, as that is the game. so i suggest you play that game and use the many methods provided to mitigate the risk from other players instead of coming to the csm and asking them to petition ccp to tilt their pvp game in your personal favour at no cost or effort for yourself. that is just a waste of time for all concerned."
9/29/2016,"from a pvp perspective, the risk is disproportionate between players. i'll skip detailing this for brevity's sake. i said meta-incentives because intangibles like kb stats, km's etc are partial motives that incent player behavior - these are indicators of one's sense of success or failure. the argument that the game is functioning as intended is problematic for a game like eve. there is an extended argument here one could make about change control and functionality and unintended functionality but it's tough discussion because of the sandbox nature - which means shoring up high sec mechanics such that high sec behaves as a more secure space than low sec or null sec is also a valid input into game play. high sec mechanic are fair game for change just like other parts of the game. high sec ganking is an insightful min/max assessment of game logic. but numerous changes which are cumulative in nature make it difficult to distinguish between performing as intended and unbalanced. the lack of proportionality in the risk between gank play style and high sec non-gank play style is both an innovative insight in how to play the game but also one that characterizes high sec as something it is not."
9/29/2016,"highsec is most certainly high security. it is not ""safe security"" as you seem to imply, but it never was intended to be. high security space is exactly that: highly secure. red frog freight makes 99.83% of its deliveries. ccp quant's numbers show that destruction in highsec makes up ~0.2% of the value goods imported/exported from the various highsec regions (and that is from all causes, not just ganking). the chance of you losing a ship to criminals is extremely small under most circumstances, probably approaching zero if you stay at your keyboard and spend any effort to defend yourself. the few situations that put you at great risk <U+FFFD> making yourself a valuable target by carrying too much cargo for instance <U+FFFD> are completely within your control and these risks are easily mitigated by various fits, ships or behaviours. i am not sure how much safer you want highsec to be before you consider it high security. a 0.001% chance of losing a ship? 0.00001%? actually i do know the answer: zero. you won't be happy until non-consensual pvp is not possible in highsec. if that is the case, i can only say that you should consider whether a pvp sandbox game that features non-consensual pvp everywhere by design is really the game for you.in any case, this has nothing to do with the op so i am done here. present your ideas in the appropriate forum if you wish to continue a discussion."
9/29/2016,"what i am arguing for is a proportional degree of risk. if you read my original post, i was *not* calling for a change in the mechanic. the risk becomes proportional as an expression of time. currently, within this power dynamic, the assets at risk between players is not equitable. longer criminal flags decrease the frequency in which the behavior can easily occur unless the ganker invests more resources (accounts, train times, alts, etc.). that investment then is similar in the sunk cost that to that of the target. that is equitable without changing the actual play style. and, importantly, the trader / hauler playstyle has a different domain of risk than a gank playstyle. i'll skip the elaboration here but these risks also make this less of an apples-to-apples comparison."
9/29/2016,"since they claim they cannot be beaten, join them. just start another permit organisation. then another and several more. mix it up and charge 2mil a month. just abuse it until it is declared a broken mechanism. it does not matter about tank - because bumping does not care and is perfectly legal. even an alpha clone can do it."
9/30/2016,"this idea of combat ships attacking non combat ships is a part of the problem. all indy type ships are designed so that they perform in a task with no though of combat. to fix a lot of these issues just make all indy ships (mining, trade, whatever) combat effective even if it is only really good at defensive combat, hell make it offensive if you want. but do this and let it stiff perform its intended role. there would be no reason that any race of people who were under constant threat of attack, would not adjust there ship building techniques to reflect the change in there universe to better perform and provide a harder target. we see this in our own historical evolution of warfare start back with sticks and stone to atomic age weapons, and now into unmanned weapon platforms. how is it that in eve we still have mining barges and freighters with no thought about defensive or offensive armaments...seriously like wth??? if miners, traders, and/or, care bears were able to have combative styled ships of their professions then there would be less issue with an unfair gank and more of an issue of learn to play.fix the ships and you will go a long way with fixing a lot of issues.note: i know that some will say that the shields and such are defensive....ya sure...but when you cant do anything but sit there and wait until your shields are drained or gone, that is not a form of active defense it is a horrible passive and not something anyone would use as a primary defense. it is only a partial method. after all of the ship rebalances and new systems that ccp has added the last change made to indies way the mining barge nerf/adjustment (which ever way you want to look at it.) force them to want to upgraded into a bigger and better ship that still performs its desired task but make it capable of either putting up a fight or give it some sorta ewar bonus to confuse its attacker so it can safely disengage. after all the wars and such i think someone would have made a safer or more combat oriented ship for trade and mining. and this would force indies to get their butts into combat oriented mindsets as in order to get into these ships they would have to learn some combat skills and such and then everyone is happy.yes either the ship would perform poorly at the combat or at the assigned indy task, i know that is the most likely result you would say. not really, we have tons of multi role ships that perform combat very well and their intended roles extremely well, indy ships could do the same and not break anything in game."
9/30/2016,no ship used for hauling should be as combat effective as a ship designed exclusively for combat.
9/30/2016,"(*snip*)no ship used for hauling should be as combat effective as a ship designed exclusively for combat.why??i see so many reasons that others have posted in so far as to why highsec players are targeted, is that because this is eve and pvp is eve. and that care bears, and what not need to not think eve it is a solo game, however by getting combat oriented industrial ships the first response is no, that should not happen. why not ? seriously, this would make the whole targeting of industrials fun right? it would get everyone into a more combat oriented playstyle.again why not? because it would make it harder to gank them..no that just means tactics would change. and it would definitely make them more lucrative with the mods being dropp other than mining upgrades. trust me gankers are gonna gank. if you look at all high sec combat i would think you would see that industrial ships are likely in 75% or possibly greater of those incidents.my question is why wouldn't they have combat oriented ships in such a dangerous profession.we used to have some cruisers and battle ships back in the day that were used to mine in. not sure but those got reworked for other stuff. its not like its a new concept. im not saying making it the best mission runner or make it the best gang support, or even the best in group ganking or solo ganking. i am however saying making it proficient in its role and combat, but it can choose to accell in either a defensive posture or a indy role but not both at same time. just as you can not go full tank and full dps in any ship or what ever. there is no need to make a hauler or a miner that is better than current ships out there who are combat role specific, but you do not have a single ship out there either that is best in all. each ship has its role where it is good, great, and some time op. lets do the same with a new industry line or some thing. let them have a choice as everyone else does. right now indies don't, ever single hauler (except the gallente now) have exactly the same ships with different looks, miners suffer from this too. we cant go out and try to build cool new builds because the ships are old outdated relics.the only reason that i think this is not something always thought of is because every game so far that i have seen other than some rts that have space combat is that industry ships have always been non combative...but so what this is eve. and anyone who has visited or lived here, knows combat is eve and that is why i don't think eve should allow itself to be dictated by old none eve concepts. combat is in every part of eve's creative life blood, but why is it not in the indy side of the game, it should be."

9/30/2016,"this is so true.pos vulnerability and timing was (and still is) working perfectly fine. i have no idea why they took it away. everyone set citadel timers to the weakest tz for possible attackers. weaponized boredome at its finest. furthermore, killing a pos requires 2 engagements - time of the first one is chosen by attacker, time of the second - by defender, which is fair. now it is - how many? 3? i never even bothered to find out. all of those timers are defined by the defender. seriously, i can understand forming 1 alarm-clock cta, but 3 of those to kill even the smallest undefended citadel? and if we're only 15 minutes late - all is in vane. that is hilariously broken."
9/30/2016,"my suggestion for citadel engagement rules: - keepstar is fine as it is - fortizar should be always vulnerable and have 2 timers - shield and armor - astrahus should be always vulnarable and have 1 timer for shield, just like ye olde pos"
