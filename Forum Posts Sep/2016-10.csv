10/1/2016,"because then we'd all just have 1 ship for each size of ship.or lets turn your suggestion on its head: why shouldn't a combat dedicated ship have enough cargo space to haul 25,000 m3?that is what you are asking for. we can simply remove the haulers, and increase the size of the cargo hold, or add specialized cargo holds to combat ships.as for ""this is eve and pvp is eve"" you do realized that the name, eve, if everyone vs. everyone....right?yes, the center position in this game is pvp. market trading? a type of pvp. even mining can have a subtle pvp element, if i get into the belt and start gobbling up asteroids faster than you i am getting resources you are not. even in a ns alliance, if i get into a sanctum or haven first, then i have denied you that isk. only one moon miner per moon, so moons and their wealth are pvp, and in this case of direct pvp as in shoot each other in the face.some of the more...shallow...posters like to try and differentiate pvp with this errant bravo sierra nonsense regard ""elite pvp"" or ""ebushido"". these people should stick to playing asteroids on their classic atari systems. bushido is bravo sierra and so is the e-version of it. if you are doing something to another player and they'd rather you not do...that is pvp.and you can try to play eve solo, but it is very hard because alot of the people who are going to try and push in your poop...they will bring friends, and their friends might bring friends and so om, and so on.as for mining cruisers, yes, the scythe and osprey, etc. were the mining cruisers, but they were seen as an intermediate step to mining barges and then exhumers. people also used to mine in battleships, but in terms of yield and cargo hold they were not quite as good as the barges/exhumers, but you could fit a tank on them. so, go haul in a battleship, fit a tank on it and haul. nothing stopping you.further, when it comes to large ships like a freighter these ships are essentially capitals and like all capitals they should require an escort. now you don't need much of an escort, a scout will help reduce risk considerably. a scout with webs, or an additional ship to act as webber will reduce risk even more. turning the freighter into a dread without a jump drive and a massive tanks is just not the right solution."
10/1/2016,"the main reason is that there's no profit to be made in aggressing them.hit a pos with 30b of stuff in it, you get an average of 15b in drops.hit a freighter with 30b of stuff - get an average 15b in drops.hit a citadel with 30b of stuff - you get a tiny amount of loot from the salvage.i don't agree with the original suggestion - i'm fine with them being fairly safe but there needs to be an incentive to attack them. asset safety unwrap fees should go to the aggressors, at the least."
10/1/2016,"the team phenomenon stuff was quite interesting.if it's done in a way where spawns of npc mining fleets are quite rare, but somewhat lucrative, this would create some interesting gameplay in the quietest areas of space.it would be a huge shot in the arm for lowsec, the region where belts are the quietest and these npcs could stack up the most - if you go through all the belts in a system and find two of these spawns, blow them up and loot their ore, that might actually be enough to make lowsec mining (with a combat escort fleet) viable in comparison to highsec."
10/1/2016,not sure if it is a good idea to recommend fw in the 'new' npe while having no time to fix fw. (both mentioned in the minutes)
10/1/2016,that's because anyone with the ability to defend a citadel gets a fort
10/1/2016,it would be really nice if they went with the idea from a year or two ago where corps/alliance can support a militia and then members can join or not. i know it would be great for corps like mine that make a point to help all types of new players
10/1/2016,"as a new player coordinator for pandemic horde. (nbi) i find that the skillets for any alphas that want to try and live in null strongly disfavor any player that chooses to play amarr, and to some extent galente. the galente characters have strong ratting potential being able to fly the vexor, but lack many offensive pvp capabilities. amarrian pilots are in an even worse shape. nully in general does not show a strong favoritism for armor doctrines for ships of under bs size. while ph can and will try to work around these limitations, and unfortunately i don't know exactly what could be done to help this situation i just wanted to bring it to attention."
10/1/2016,"as for me (and i hope a large portion of ppl in nullsec) it's about the ability to enforce your rules in a space that you live. there is already a serious frustration about those bloody interceptors that zip through any camps. and now we've got the citadels that once anchored are nigh on impossible to remove.the sense of ownership of the space is diluted. in my opinion, that sense is among the strongest initiatives that encourages ppl to live in nullsec. well i mean those actual alive alliances, not the renters."
10/1/2016,"(new player here)press ""f"" for instant action. that's not what eve is or what it should strive to be. if i want action, i join a corporation that shoots down players or i do a security mission. that's as far as it should go (i'm having this ""dungeon finder"" of other mmos in mind since ""raids"" was mentioned below that part). the mmos that have that and offer their players instant action don't last, they never do...because all the fundamentals are missing. gathering your ships to start a raid, instead of warping to some place, is part of the experience and really important, regardless of whether the player notices this or not. eve doesn't have to appeal to everyone and that is ok.if you worry about new players, look into reaching the people out there. define your target groups and actively try to get these people...or make yourself at least known. as a general gamer interested in sci-fi games, i would know about homeworld remastered, elite: dangerous and star citizen, certainly not about eve because it is only rarely in the media and when it is, it's about a story that happened and which seems so distant to the reader. getting articles about an ingame-event which actively involves new players + cheaper first few months would have been great (mostly too late at this point thanks to f2p). doing something like this once a year, preferably shortly before the winter season when people rather stay inside, might have been a good idea. apart from that, numbers are also lower because mmos in general are in a decline. communities on the internet have shifted and now there are hubs like reddit, facebook etc. ""infiltrating"" groups associated with sci-fi and rping on these media and advertising your product there could be worth a try. magazines have been in heavy decline for years and where are people going to read about your product? it's these hubs and media coverage that doesn't immediately show this game's hardcore side like the coverage of the stories that i mentioned. and obviously don't just stick to english/international places, different countries with different hubs are worth catering to. vk (russia), nico<U+FFFD> (japan), sina weibo/youku (china) + streaming sites. breaking into the large korean market could be worth it (they have afreeca for streaming)...or the brazilian one (they actually do play a lot of pc games since consoles are still expensive + 200 million people isn't nothing). india might be worth something as well in a couple of years. what i'm basically saying, potential does exist - the gaming market is constantly getting bigger and bigger but most of that is concentrated in areas where they are getting better and better access. wow is losing numbers too but their mistake is making the game easier and easier (to appeal to new, lazy players which doesn't work, as stated above) while trying to live on its legacy. eve has a huge advantage since we can write our own stories, so it should definitely survive wow.i agree with this...or rather, it is somewhat hard for new players to find into the game. this game is overwhelming and you have the forum, the rookie help channel and the wiki to get answers. that isn't necessarily enough though. the forum is a good place for guides and such but usually i have several questions and a new one pops into my mind but i won't ask everything(well, rather anything) here because i don't want to spam a thread...just imagine if everyone did that. apart from that, these days not everyone uses forums. the rookie help channel is usually overcrowded (even with the ""apparent lack"" of new players), so it's hard to get your answers or only read every fifth line since that one is addressed to you. i find myself mostly googling and getting the appropriate answer from both wikis and forums. not everyone does that though and it also doesn't help you decide what you want to do. in that case, you need someone to talk to and corporations would be one such an idea. the ones you start in, for instance, could be used to help the players more individually as it shares the load. (speaking for myself, i actually want to know what outfits best to use for x ship or what ships are good for this and that and etc, talking to someone experienced who knows about pvp (or pve for other people) you can't do that in the rookie channel since the answers aren't short.) the tutorial missions are great to see what you do in each but after that, you usually want answers about how much money each category brings, what you can do where and how to progress from your current point. the problem here is the different languages as people would probably all write in a single chat...unless it's possible to add several ones for starter corporations. and from there you could go out into the wide, wide universe.also something which could help with player retention: overview of (public) chat channels. create an ingame-overview with all the public channels available, under different categories, with the current numbers of chatters displayed. (i believe) most of the channels are player-generated, so make the creators administrators and let it work like an irc-channel. this buffs the social aspect of the game, creates bonds and that helps in keeping players in the game (well, with f2p they could just use that, instead of subscribing). this also helps with the downtime when you are piloting through several systems. basically, these channels make it possible to connect to a completely different player which otherwise i would probably never meet (unless i would also play in the same corporation/alliance or fly through similar space). after one month of non-usage of a channel, these could be auto-deleted to make the name available again.(well, reaching character limit...i haven't read past page 6, so some issues might be addressed later in the document.)"
10/1/2016,"the idea of combat ships attacking non-combat ships is a part of the bigger problem. as all indy type ships (miners, haulers, freighters, etc) are designed so that they perform in a task with no thought of full combat capabilities. a way to fix a lot of the problems is to just create these ships with combat in mind. consider that all combat ships now can be outfitted for different role types except the indies. take any combat ship and it has multiple bonus that allow it to be configured for different roles/jobs. take that same concept applied to indies. they could have options to run a build set up for either great defense or offense, or have them ewar to confuse there attackers and allow escape. or they could run a build set up for max proficiencies on their particular job (mine, haul).there is no reason that any of the races in eve, after years of wars and pirates and other such combative events would not have by now updated there ships to reflect the environment they work and live in. in all arms races guns get bigger, and armor gets better. from sticks and stones to guns and bombs, to nuclear warheads and unmanned drones. how is it that the indies are the only ships in eve that have not evolved with the game? you see all kinds of advancements with new technologies and such from the different races on how they build there combat ships but indies are just the same or worse off from 2003. seriously???if indies were able to have options to get creative with their builds like others are, there would be incentives to learn combat playstyles more than just the basics, they would provide a more lucrative target because they would carry modules other than freight, mining upgrades. ganking would not be consider such a unfair and unskilled possible harassing play style.(i know this will get some peoples hair standing up, i don't mean it is truly unskilled but most serious low/null sec and pvp players don't think taking toss away ships and ganking unarmed indies is a skill worth learning. it does take some effort to organize and equate gain vs loss on the gank runs. but the combat effort is warp in, stop indy from moving, then just wait untill it goes pop.)if indy pilots and high sec players were able to fight back, then it would not be so much of an issue about unfairness but more about a learn 2 play because they were ganked. and we all know gankerz are going to gank.there is no reason why not to do this.think about it for a moment, so many players have posted that eve is pvp and that has to be accepted when you undock. eve is not a single player game, interactions will happen whether you want it or not. not only would this make a better way of ""content creation"" but it would add fun to the ganker with more challenge and to the indy who wants to fight back and or protect his assets. this would force everyone to learn combat for self defense not just for mission running. by incentivizing indys with combat capable ships they would need to get(""gud"") proper skills to fight. as it is no indy really needs to train out side of their profession.would this make it harder to gank? no, not really. player will adapt and overcome by changing tactics to still get the achieved effect of a gank. look at all of the ganking over all, i would say that anything out side of high sec cant be considered ganking as it is open season down there and everyone accepts that. so that leaves the real issue only in high sec, and over 75% ganks involve indy ships. then my question is why wouldn't those people have outfitted their professional ships for such an extremely dangerous job with combat upgraded versions or something?we used to have ..i believe frigates, cruisers, and battle ships with mining options. so this is not a new concept and its not totally an alien one either. i am not saying to make these ships the best at any particular combat style like solo gank, group buff, or what ever. what i am thinking is that it would have bonuses that would allow it to either fit for its indy profession or have other bonus toward combat that allow it make combat builds to either flee, defend itself, or stand and fight.give indys a choice that everyone else already has. with the new update for barges and exhumers maybe there is some possibilities there, but in reality you still cant truly defend yourself from other players or even attack players with any of those. even so that is not comparable to full choice when looking at all other ships in the game and then looking back at the indy line and seeing how poorly they have evolved with the game.there is no reason i can think off that this should not be done. if you can please let me know.remember this is eve and combat is in every part of eve. it was in its conception, its in its creation, it's always going to be a part of eve. anyone who has visited or lived in eve knows this is true.combat and pvp is a huge part of eve, no one can say that is not true. so if it is such a big part of eve, why then do indies not get to be part of it? give indies combat capable ships that perform career specific roles and you will see a better overall eve. honestly what do you think?"
10/1/2016,"i think this has nothing to do with organizing a (now completed) roundtable and that your post should be in another, or a new thread."
10/2/2016,care to elaborate?
10/2/2016,"using implants+having to switch home stations back and forth constantly.besides, if as you say ""this is already in the game"", why not implement it in an intuitive and coherent way? it's actually better to be killed or suicide than jumping from a prepared clone bay in a controlled manner? sorry, but that doesn't make sense."
10/2/2016,"implants are optional. if alliance fitting doctrines require implants, that's an alliance problem not an eve problem."

10/3/2016,nobody mentioned alliances at all.
10/3/2016,so half of the solution is to not put implants in if you're going to hop across the universe frequently. my pvp toon only rolls implants when i'm going to be inactive for weeks at a time.

10/3/2016,"my view for the purpose of the scope network would be the system that replaces our current mission system. i've already spoken in the f&i about it. but it would be a system by system feed for combat, mining etc. provide through the scope network for players to take missions from the npc factions.""the lord loosed upon them his fierce anger all of his fury and rage. he dispatched against them a band of avenging angels"" - the scriptures, book ii, apocalypse 10:1 #npclivesmatter #freetheboobs"

10/3/2016,what if you couldn't light a cyno or interact with a cyno while within 1000km of an anchored object?
10/3/2016,"there are gazillion ways to nerf everything: cynos, capships, citadels. the challenge is to find a solution that would generate content rather than deny it. if traveling gets too easy, capital hunters will never bother - content denied. but if capship pilots feel it's too dangerous, they never login their caps - content denied again. so it's a tricky one. the risk vs reward should feel just about right for both parties.delayed tethering seems way too harsh. you get scrambled and you're done: no tethering, no docking. guaranteed death unless you get reinforcements really really fast. why do i even want to light cyno on a citadel then? lighting it on a spot seems a lot safer.i have another idea, which may work. citadels will give free tethering only to a proper ship size (that can dock). you can still get tethering for a larger ship if you activate a special module on that ship. on top of that, this module may or may not provide a boost to your ship's mass to help it against bumpers. you cannot safe-logoff with any module active, same for this case. basically, want a safe travel - build proper citadels. otherwise, you only have a ""panic button"". if tackled, push it and get reinforcements. you will have a fight on your citadel, which gives you advantage. lose that fight - lose the capship too. sounds fair for me."

10/3/2016,"jump freighter pilots wouldn't do anything of the sort. they simply wouldn't do anything. any jumps. any hauling. we'd be fine for the first week or two, then **** would rapidly start seizing up, and ccp would see protests that make monoclegate look like it was nothing. but hey, at least the problem of completely defenseless ships having some degree of relative safety would be fixed, right?"
10/3/2016,"you have a rich experience of leading fleets at 4 am, do you?"
10/3/2016,"heaven forbid that pvp would happen in a pvp game!why should jump freighters be able to jump from jita into the safety of a citadel with no risk of suicide ganking in hisec? it's a pleasure that every freighter pilot enjoys when travelling to/from jita, why should the lowsec/nullsec folks miss out? you are denying content to other players.there are adaptation paths available: use undock bookmarks use stasis webifiers to accelerate entry into warp on arrival do not jump into systems with neutrals/hostiles around have combat support available miners have to put up with suicide ganking, afk cloakers, and <U+FFFD> come november <U+FFFD> having boosters on-grid. why should jump freighter pilots miss out on the content generation opportunities fun?"
10/3/2016,"having wormholes collapsing behind you should be part of life in wormhole space. i wonder if there's opportunity for wormholes which can fit only a handful of ships (i.e.: a fixed number of transits, rather than mass-based limits), wormholes which collapse a short time after the first transit, and ""trap door"" wormholes which can no longer be entered from the ""other end"" once they have been used (signature x444 since 4 is an unlucky number for the chinese)? for trap doors, i'd prefer to see the transiting ship dumped in a random location, since kill-boxing a ""trap door"" exit node would be far too easy.these might catch inexperienced wormhole spelunkers by surprise, but surely there needs to be room in the game for expensive mistakes?if nullsec, why not lowsec too? add a station facility or deployable infrastructure which can generate aforementioned one-way wormholes (fluxing, trapdoor, otherwise) so that they can not be used as reliable means to bypass dangerous space (being the logistics routes that your enemy knows of). the intent here being to open up opportunities for exploration/roaming activity without making routine transit easier."

10/4/2016,"this is a ticket i have submitted to ccp recently and they responded that they would forward it to dev. they also suggested that i submit it to this forum and we will see the reaction ! so this is what i am doing right here :dear ccp, i have been playing eve for 6 month now as a new player, and would like to share with you a few comments and my opinion in general about the game. i am very disappointed by the pve aspect of the game which in my opinion is a real disaster.among the most annoying pieces:1. cosmos missions are broken, often end up in dead-ends. they loot nothing valuable and are not worth the time playing them.2. normal missions are obsolete, repetitive and extremely boring, each race has way too many agents, but they all provide the same scenarios, no surprises, no original content, no descent loot, no embedded pvp.3. faction standing progress cuts you out from a big portion of the game because when you progress in one you regress in another making it impossible later to participate in 75% of faction warefare. this is a disastrous design !4. ccp dev does not introduce original content (pve events) as much as they should. the only, i mean the only (besides citadels) original content ccp has introduced this year was the amarr purity event (which would also provide immediate trading and pvp possibility) which is the only positive note. you need to introduce many more like those. that is one event for the year (the others were no go's).5. there is no ""in-between"" difficulty playing environment half way between pve and low-sec/null pvp. its either too difficult (low-sec pvp), or too easy (pve). this design is again a disaster. this is because the eve player base is aging making for new players the learning curve way too steep.6. security status is a real pain in the neck, it makes you juggle between low-sec and high-sec in order to get your sec status back, either pay a fortune or spend weeks in obsolete missions.7. the incentive distribution in eve between high-sec, low-sec, and null is totally totally totally broken as well ! high-sec is dry like a desert, there is absolutely nothing nothing nothing to loot from. you battle for an hour just to get a few light missiles as loot !! what the heck. low sec same (it has become a pvp arena and nothing else which is quite sad), exploration same. null sec is in-penetrable, run by boring player run corporations which are all but worth joining.8. the game still has a very annoying flaw/exploit making suicide ganking way too easy. that cuts off for many players the hauling and mining activity. i know i tried it and its so easy, its almost like cheating.9. ccp will introduce in november alpha clones, a fitting tool, some graphical design improvement and gui enhancement. that is nice but ccp need to enrich the pve content before anything else. at this moment, i can tell you the pve content its not looking good, it's outdated, boring, is not worth the time because of disastrous loots. you urgently need to hire more/better devs for eve, i mean really, do it and work on that.10. the citadel upgrade is only directly usable for maybe 0.1% of the players, i mean seriously who can afford running those ?11. same applies for pos.12. please ccp, stop spending money and resources on ""vr"" virtual reality r&d, it's going nowhere ! the only thing you get with vr is a stomach pain (sea sick like hell) and you look like an idiot while playing it.13. forthcoming alpha clones: they wont work in the long term and will become ccp next headache because they will require extra man-power resources in order to monitor and fix abuses and ultimately they will de-gradate the overall game experience ! they are only a quick fix for more fundamental issues in the game (like i comment above). alpha subscriptions will create a 6 month rush in mining and missions and then it will all resume as today like a melted cheese. alpha clones will also open doors to bots, jita spammers, and more suicide ganking, which are all three cancers in this game ! it will be very difficult in the future to separate the noisy alphas from the real alpha players. ccp, it is not a good idea to under-sell your services. players are willing to pay if the content is good ! if you give it away for free, its a signal that you might not be in control of your business.as a general note, ccp, it seems to me that you are trying to dance on two different rhythm at the same time ! pvp and pve, and you sell your product as a pve game, where as in reality it is not a pve game (rather half way only). ultimately the game seems to evolve run by a fragmented community who cannot agree about the fundamentals on what should be done.i hope you will take my comments seriously and address them for the coming month and year, for the sake of this game which has huge potential.best regards, from ""a motivated player.""o7 !"

10/5/2016,"3. i should have said : ""...cuts you out from a big faction warefare portion of the game and some missions which are not presented to you"". fw is my favorite part so far, and i would like to participate in all 4 factions, but i can't because of my negative standing. as per today i am stuck on caldari fw. the least which could be done is to calculate the effective standing (taking into account the trained skills) when applying to a fw faction rather than the raw standing which is a pain to bring back to zero.you need to go back to the roots and do some fw and revise your opinion on this. i do it most of my time in eve. fw is already brutal because of pirates who roam low sec (solo or fleets endlessly back and forth the pipelines) in search for easy kills. the problem is that a vast majority of them are not looking for fights but only easy kills to show off on their kill board ! they often enter the plex with blink super charged faction ships against which you have zero chance and the only thing you can do as newbie is run and learn nothing in the process. i was lucky once having a fight with a pirate flying a ""normal"" t1 ship who explained to me a few tricks but this is nowadays pretty rare.this is a huge subject of debate, too long to elaborate here. there are tons of ideas to try out and make the ganking more interesting for both sides in the fight. definitively something ccp should try to elaborate and make it more fair for both sides. i have already presented some ideas to ccp so that the ganker still has good chances but is exponentially penalized if he repeats the gank over and over again at the same spot. i also had some ideas in order to give the targeted victim a better chance to escape.i do not have access to relevant data to prove this nor access the ccp databases. but this is how you and i would be able to have the real number: take a list of all characters who log on avg 10+ hours per week for 2015, filter them by age and consider only those ages between 2 month and 2 years, look at their wallet balance (isk cash, not assets) and sort the list. you will be shocked by the result, it would be nowhere close to what is required to run a citadel. do the same again but this time take only characters with age being the medium on a standard gauss curve on the total population.easy ! although i am not here to convince anybody, i am only here to give my opinion.alpha clones will break a fundamental rule in eve as you stated earlier: actions have consequences. an alpha clone is totally anonymous, no credit card attached, no valid email, no way to link the character with the player, they are also not garbage collected after one month. use your imagination and do you see my point now ? one possible scenario: an army of alpha bots cruising around belts and mining or suicide ganking at multiple gates systematically and repetitively around the clock, or sending out spams in local in crowded systems. it takes a cheap 200 usd pc and 5000 lines of code to program this with a scripting tool. there is no easy way to stop this possible scenario to happen unless ccp monitors this around the clock ! do you really think that ccp will spend their time in cleaning this mess if it happens ? its going to be a full time job which would be much better filled by a software developer rather than a watchdog !until now, temporary accounts would automatically expire and therefore doing an auto-cleanup. but with alpha clones: no more.yes, i understand and i agree with you fully, but ccp needs to adjust their advertising / marketing communication better and the first place to do so is in the o7 show ! and then on their web site. the web site is ambiguous, the marketing flyers miss-leading, it presents the game with blink open features without telling that being killed in this game by other players is the common denominator, and is in fact routine and not exception.i have already been insulted like a dog in local because i dear attacking a player in high-sec or try to steal his loot to force a pvp fight. this should be fixed by ccp. i think that local chat should be permanently removed from the game."
10/5/2016,"***introduction***greetings! i am pleased to say once again that i am going to be putting my name in the hat for the upcoming csm elections, csm 12! it's still a bit early, so this thread will more than likely change as new updates and devblogs come out, but i wanted to get out there early and open myself up for questions, conversation, and pretty much anything!this is my 3rd year running, but for those who may not know me, let me go ahead and introduce myself! i have been playing eve since 2011 (minus the one failed account in 2010 ... *close out tutorial* - *undocks* - *promptly gets killed by a rat and quits*). i found out about eve from eve radio and from there other players and staff members helped me get the hang of things and from there i think the rest is history. i was hooked, it was unlike any other game that i have played and i just love it. being a active member of the community is something that i am proud of and because of it, i have gotten to meet so many amazing people and it really has become like a second family for me. a couple of things about me ... community highlightsdj and station managment at eve radio (dj yumene) ceo of eve radio alliance regular organizer of eve radio mining operations owner of 'sounds of new eden' fansite broadcast4reps volunteer moderator/staff tweetfleet slack community moderatoringame highlightsthe soul society industrial and logistics director logistics owner/operator for army of new eden & phoenix federation coalition former deepspace alliance leadership / sov manager former deepspace alliance logistics director former logistics operator/owner for the methodical alliance & gotg coalitioni am a big supporter of player events and communities and have always been an active member myself. one of which i have been with since 2010, eve radio/gaming radio network, where i have served (and currently) as a manager alongside dj accy since 2014. i have also together with accy, regularly since 2014 organized and participated in every 24hr eve radio mining operation and are coming close to the 10th operation. in addition to these fleets, i have also been a regular member to spectre fleets for well over a year, a npsi community, among others.ingame, i am overall a industrial focused player living in nul-sec sov. i am a miner, manufacturer, logistics pilot, and pretty much anything in between. i so like to say i have done a little bit of 'almost' everything as i have tried my share of different aspects of the game as well; from being a pirate, faction warfare, exploration, mission running, and small gang/large fleet pvp.so this brings me here once again, asking for your support by placing your vote for me in the upcoming csm 12 elections in 2017! i still have the passion and drive to wanting to give back to the community and help get our voices out there to ccp.csm 11, i was 'very' close to getting a spot on the current csm, coming in at 15! i am still honored at the amount of support that i got and i hope that i can count on your support again this year again!***industrial focus***the industrial side of the game still seems to be the more under-appreciated. however i can't say that it isn't getting love, specifically with the number of changes and features that are going to be introduced - a strong industrial candidate is needed to get our voice out there - where past csm have lacked. the current csm has done a great job this term and have had a major role in industry changes - but with that said, i feel that with everything still going on and happening and the future plans that have been announced a stronger industry presence would be very beneficial and needed.***ideas and thoughts***some of my thoughts and ideas here. there will be a few that i mention here that i also talked about in my thread from last year, however it's something that hasn't really been addressed either.planetary interaction: pi is always going to be one of those things i feel is going to be brought up a bit i feel. i don't remember the last time that pi got any major overhaul, if ever. while it is a mostly passive task, it is still a painful one at that - specifically with all the damn clicking you have to do - and forbid you make a mistake and have to redo everything one by one. here are some of my ideas:- (1) factory plans/templates: this would be a way to knock down the amount of clicking you have to do to set up your factories where you could essentially save a pre-set plan to lay them down.- (2) 'move' button: a simple move button that will allow you to simply move a structure around instead of having to decommission and then set it back up all over again.- (3) 3d factory 'pop-up': possibly shrink/remove this. annoying to have your factories side by side and the 3d pop-up gets in the way of you trying to click the next one.- (4) resources/links: create a possible button where after you set up links that will route the selected resource to all target factories that use that resource. instead of having to do it one by one. (example: extractors set up to gather 'base metals' and routed to go to a storage facility. select on the storage facility and select the base metals that are incoming, then on the bottom have a button called ""route all"" which when clicked will create routes that go to all factories that has a schematic loaded requiring that resource - boom! one click!).industrial notification love: nearly everything in eve has notifications, but why no industrial notification love? indy job ready and needs to be delivered? no notice! pi extractors time runs out? no notification! moon silo's getting full? no notifications! where is the indy notification love?"
10/5/2016,"***accessibility***this is a topic that is pretty strong with me; the topic of accessibility. eve is great in terms of accessibility, however there can of course be way for this to be improved for more players. we have players with all walks of life and players who face different challenges than normal. players with disabilities are more of a minority however, they should still be represented and have a voice.there are a lot of options that ccp already has to help also, tools that were once in the game. eve is very accessible for the most part already, however there are little things that can still be improved in this area and also it is very beneficial to have someone who can give a voice to those who rely on options for accessibility. some 'little things'- more ui rescalling options- more text size options- bring font icons back to the main chat windows and not hidden in the settings- more color options (ie: being able to change the red sphere color in the scanning ui for colorblind players)- more visual options for hearing impared (see below)- make ui transparency optional, not forced when you first load up the game.for myself, i am hard of hearing (completely deaf on right ear, left ear is so-so). there isn't really anything that ccp can do about voice communications always being preferred, however, it would be nice to have more options for those who do rely on more visuals (ie: better and updated fleet interface with more visual options - possible fleet broadcast 'tabs'? or how about a visual for when you're getting shot at like red borders?).obviously this is one area and there are bits (as i put below) where you can also help in other areas of accessibility. ***industrial/non-industrial <U+FFFD>little things<U+FFFD> (w/ revisits)***- blueprint invention: bringing back the invention section on blueprint information without having to go to the copy tab and then click invention. would make it very much easier and user friendly.- courier contracts: ability to see if there is a cargo can inside of a contract. not able to see what's inside the cans, just to show if there is one or not. also add commas on the contract sizes!- cyno/seige timers: a timer on the top left (where all other timers go) that shows the time left on a cycle (ie: generators/industrial core). this is for convenience, and we have timers for pretty much everything else.- comet mining: not really a 'little' thing, but i have to make a note to put this in here somewhere. please?- mobile tractor units: new option to launch for corp would be nice."

10/6/2016,you had me at eve radio. you lost me at messing with pi.after/during world war bee & citadels there was a few months where you could make 10 bil isk a month with 2 accounts doing pi. pi i is a good income for click nerds if we make it too easy these spikes of billions a month will no longer exists.
10/7/2016,a freighter was bumped for 5 or 6 hours earlier this week and there was no gank attempt against the freighter. it was only freed from the bumping when the second bumper disconnected from the game.at what point is the ganker community going to collectively admit that bump-tackling *while defended by concord* is absolutely broken?
10/7/2016,"the capital class interdictor would be something you did not field regularly, and that you did not field lightly. it would have a hefty price tag being a t2 variant of an already existing capital ship. it would not carry any sort of weapon system or even be able to self sustain the scripted version of it's interdiction bubble without carriers or sc to aid it. these ships would share the jump range of a dread and would not be deployable in low sec.costing in the range of 3-7b mineral cost and not being insurable past it's t1 counterpart a capital interdictor would be something used when you have the upper hand and absolutely do not want the hostile fleet escaping. sporting several times the hp of a dread or carrier and dual defensive bonuses(resists and local rep) the ship is designed purely to soak fire and keep hostile ships locked down over a larger area than previously possible. it would not have the massive hp of a sc or titan but would be enough to soak fire with the aid of reps from your fleet.the normal unscripted bubble of the capital interdictor would extend out to a 40km radius, cycle every 30 seconds using a high amount of cap. the bubble would cause the ship to become immobile and increase it's agility/mass by 16 fold so you could not effectively bump it out of your way. after the bubble is disengaged either by the pilot or forcefully by nueting the ship would be unable to warp for 1 minute afterwards or jump for 10. the scripted variant would extend to an 80km radius and would require significantly more cap than the ship could generate for more than a very short burst without the aid of carriers or sc supporting it. scripting also reduces the cap recharge by 75% and has all the same effects as the unscripted bubble. in short- t2 version of dread or carrier(likely dread)- 7-10b to be determined by the dev designing it- several times the hp of it's t1 counterpart- only as insurable as any other t2 ship- 7.5% repair bonus per level, 5% resist bonus per level- 40km radius bubble unscripted. immobile while activated- unable to jump for 10 minutes after deactivation- scripted 80km radius. 75% reduced cap recharge.- no additional high slots, purely a support ship not a force multiplier in any way."
10/8/2016,"pi is a good income, but it's still something that does need a major overhaul. even when the changes i had proposed, there is still going to be a ton of clicking. i also don't feel that a few changes will change the income rates either.right now: you have 4-5 click to make just to set up a initial resource route, not to mention all the clicks to set up links and set up everything (buildings, schematics, ect). you are looking at around 2,000 and upwards to 10,000 clicks per account overall with the current system depending on what you are doing. what i proposed won't be able to get rid of all the clicking, i don't think anything can. pi will, i feel, always will be the click-fest that it is. with that said tho, pi is also one of the areas that has been pretty much untouched for years, and it really is time for a overhaul - time to upgrade!"
10/8/2016,"i'm glad you're running again, but i have a few questions and comments.my first question is this; what do you think the function of the csm is, and what do you think it should be?if you had to call one thing your platform, what would it be?with steve ronuken (fuzzysteve) on the csm, and a number of other csm's on csmxi that are very heavy into mining and production in all areas of space, are you saying that industry doesn't have a voice? i would strongly disagree. in all honesty i disagree with candidates when part of their platform is ""insinuate a portion of the playerbase aren't represented"", even more so in situations where i think they are currently very adequately represented. i'm much more interested in what makes a candidate feel they are the representation people need rather than the back and forth of ""well i'm better than that other guy"".with the introduction of engineering platforms for example, i can see why having a number of industrial focused csm's would be a bonus, but for someone who doesn't know you, what makes you special in this field? what do you produce? where do you do it? do you feel you can represent the higher end industrial players (capital, super, titan)?hopefully i don't come off as over critical as i'm not trying to be... you just happen to be first cat off the rank. i will be grilling most candidates to see what their motivations are. :)"
10/8/2016,"hey judge! thank you! i do plan to keep at it and keep running until i can finally represent the community, and possibly for further terms. i don't give up easily that's for sure. i want to bring up your last point asking what my motivation is. it may sound cheesy, but eve as a whole has helped me more than i can say. from when i first started with eve radio, my corp, my alliance, and the community as a whole. i have grown so much since i gotten to meet people and develop relationships - both online and in real life. because of the people i have come across, i have been able to open up more than i have ever done before - i have also been to eve vegas 3 times and that's a lot for me since i suffer from severe social anxiety where i have trouble even leaving the house. i really do love the eve community. <3being able to have the opportunity to do something like this for the community would mean so much to me and it would be a way for me to 'give back' in a way. it's much deeper for me. so i wanted to say that piece first and get that out there. as for the question on the csm: elected by the community to represent their interests. primary function - it is a way for ccp to directly communicate with players for feedback on changes/updates/additions/ect and also feedback and ideas from the community to ccp. i think that's a simple enough explanation and i'm not sure how it can be different than it already is. seems to be also doing better this term compared to past terms - especially last year with many rumors going around that there may not be any more csm terms because of broken trust. so that's refreshing to see. but i would like to see more promotion on what the csm is and that it's there. i remember last season approaching people, both new and older players who didn't even know about the voting season, let alone even knowing what the csm is. i also understand that steve for one is also a industry player, and i love steve, he's incredible! but he's also focused on high-sec rather than my area, which is nul-sec. the others may have done industry/mining, but if i can recall it's not their main area. tho even with that said, i want to say that the current csm have done great, don't get me wrong at all, on representing industrialists as well.industry is about 95% of what i do (i have to leave the %5 open for the other stuff i do of course - pvp/pve ratting/ect). i agree 100% that this next term with all the industry features and changes coming that having strong industrial candidates will be a major bonus and even more needed.if i could call to one thing for my platform ... i know i'm crazy and it most likely out of reach - comet mining! it's a topic that's been out there for a while and i have a habit of bringing it up at pretty much all my campaigns so far, and you gave me the perfect opportunity to do so again! thank you!

10/11/2016,"capitals meant to stay on a battlefield with subcapital support not to stay alone and dominate the whole field, without the need of subcapitals and tackle. carriers and sc can allready tackle with warp disruptor, and web fighters. (wich is allready too bad) not to mention aoe death rays..... and haw guns.what you offer is a solution to field only caps, without the need of any dictors, and pretty much without the need of any subcapital support. pricetag doesn't mean anything nowdays, even if it would come in a price of a titan it would still worth it, cause you free up all your pilots from subcapitals, and can make them sit in only capitals.we have allready way too powerfull capitals i don't think we'd need another unkillable capital what can tackle key enemy ships from 80km without the fear of getting destroyed, caue it's hp would last long enought to end it's cycle and repped up instantly by the fax machines. it would erase the mobility of subcapitals, and completely clear all their allready low chances while fighting against capitals.please no, no need for more capitals and capital classes."
10/12/2016,"i'm missing a lot of feedback or questions about the significant difference in fuel costs for a pos vs even a high sec engineering platform. there's a 10+% difference in fuel blocks required to run an engineering platform with the 3 high sec options, compared to a current large pos. i'm wondering if the representation at the csm is taking smaller corps and alliances into account when discussing these changes.the abilities of even a small pos, versus the 3 services you can put into a medium engineering array, don't match up.from a large pos, to a medium engineering array signifies a very large los of functionality for a small corp / alliance, yet has in increased fuel cost associated with it.could ccp / the csm please comment on this point and if it was discussed?i obviously wasn't able to raise this before the csm summit, as the numbers, sizes and setups were not available before hand and i had hoped wouldn't be as staggering a difference for a small corp as ourselves.this is making me want to petition to maintain the ability to use a pos for smaller corps, as at this rate, a citadel is unaffordable.thanks,ijlja"
10/12/2016,"the cost are/can be hard on a small corp of a only a few members. me personally, i am okay with cost. one of the worst features i find in new eden is how easy it is for people to make corporations. we need fewer one man corps and more small corps -20 to 100 members.the issue is the corp controls suck dinosaur nuggets - yet so much is tied to the piece of shat structures in space that ccp can't give us the corp/alliance control system we should have. so we sit and rot in these small corps of less than 20 people (most are alts) and ***** because we can't compete with, on a individual level with the large and mega-corps that have a lot more man power and finance option.so in the long run i am happy for the feedback you provide, but we need to adapt to the changes and most won't survive the changes. so make some friends, merge corps and go from there.right now, i have the system worked out for managing the numbers, i just need to get more people to join my corp.yet, i am also not going to kid myself with keeping a small corp. if i can't get the numbers i am looking for by the new year (or close to), i will happily close my corp and join a larger one. i am just waiting on ccp to upgrade their corp/alliance controls and inventory management systems.i hope this didn't come across harsh. i had no intention for it to if it did.

10/16/2016,"i did a quick read of the current csm minutes. it seems that most of the npe focus is on generating content to make npe more engaging. has there been any discussion or significant insight into what converts a trial player into a paid player? ccp seems to favor data-driven discussions/ideas, and to that end, would it be possible to make available new player usage stats to the csm as a way to discuss player conversion?in a narrative sense, most of us can probably identify key moments that got us hooked into eve. these moments for me were interactions with other, more seasoned vets. much of the npe content / discussion does not seem focused on ""soft power"" or social ideas. of course, that is not an easy idea to pull in programmatic terms. but, i bet the raw stats, especially with the upcoming clone changes will tell a story of npe and those stats could be used to help better convert players (and to rebuild the eve population).i'd love to see an active surveying, even if just short surveys, of incoming players with subsequent surveys along whatever time frame makes sense. one thing to capture would be the player's perceptions especially as they change over time as they remain in unpaid status. i speculate that a player goes from excited and engaged to having short or long term goals (and a sense of satisfaction) to paid status, or arcs from expectant to disappointed. this is just a strawman example. a lot could be done here and it's a lost opportunity if the data isn't generated too.it would be great to develop statistics on over this over the long term and to include csm discussion on this to make for an overall better npe."
10/17/2016,ever seen the mad max movies....tell that to those guys....or the new death race movie....them tractor trailers are pretty effective weapons if they are fitted properly....just saying...
10/17/2016,"yes, lets base game balance on....movies."
10/17/2016,"to start, i have made billions in the past suicide ganking and have given it up for trading. that said, i feel it is a necessary part of eve, and should not be nerfed, if anything it should be easier to successfully suicide gank a ship.the way i see it there are 2 aspects to ganking issue.1) ganker disruption/player precaution to prevent being ganked2) real consequences for criminal activity/ganker assets at risk for retaliation.all of these issues need to be addressed in ways that do not make ganking a ship harder (ex nerfing bumping, buffing concord, buffing freighter hp, etc.) because that will not prevent ganking. balancing this gameplay issue is dependent on giving players the mechanics to retaliate effectively against gankers. this way the gankers can still gank all they want, but they have to fight for their ability to gank. the mechanics need to be in place so players can police the gankers. code literally destroys hundreds of billions in player assets weekly and have been doing it for a long time now. imagine if all those players they attacked organized an effort against code tomorrow, the result would be code station/gate camped. code would not lose any assets other than throw away gank ships, they would just be possibly undable to continue to operate effectively. considering the fact they have destroyed trillions in assets in the past, one would think it is only fair that code assets would be at risk for destruction if this coalition was organized. under current mechanics that is not the case, there in lies the problem.1) ganker disruption/player precaution to prevent being ganked-currently there are plenty of precautions one can take to prevent being ganked, that said just because one was careless and did not take proper caution to prevent loss of their ship that does not mean the mechanics that would allow one to retaliate should not exist. 2) real consequences for criminal activitynone of the proposed changes would change suicide ganking as we know it today, however these changes would make it easier for players to retaliate in significant ways.-changes need to be made to the undock invulnerability-aggress red blinking ship on the gate.. they jump through leaving you with a 30 second timer unable to chase behind, kinda ridiculous.-tags can only be used to increase security status to -5, from there players must rat to increase sec status, this way gankers undock in something other than a throw away gank ship.-ganker toons in npc corps really need to be looked at- allow unoccupied ships floating in space to be destroyed without criminal flag. if a player can take a unoccupied ship floating in space without a flag, they should also be able to destroy it without a flag.- toons with -5 and below sec status should not be able to dock in high sec stations, -4 sec status toons can dock in .5 systems and up, -3 sec status toons can dock in .6 systems and up and so on. all toons regardless of sec status can dock in citadels, at the citadel owners discretion. this restriction would push more players out of npc stations and into citadels. citadel markets specifically for criminals would spring up in low security space. this would also allow players who are fed up to target citadels that harbor and supply/harbor specific criminals. also, gankers would have to undock in something other than a throw away gank ship to go rat if they wanted to access higher security status npc stations, giving players the opportunity to destroy gankers in their more expensive ratting ships. this would create content, and would be good for eve.with these changes, suicide ganking stays the same, but those who gank are at risk of retaliation. this is needed, it's ridiculous that ganker groups can destroy hundreds of billions in assets with impunity. i dont expect to see this happen, even though i think it would be great for the game in many ways but these are my thoughts. this is how you give power to the player to retaliate, balancing ganking without nerfing it.also, allowing alphas to attack players in high sec is a mistake, players are going to abuse the ability to simply make another alpha gank alt again and agian and again."
10/18/2016,"hell why not, its a game right. besides if it works with random pickup trucks and station wagons in the middle east with 50cals and anti-air cannons welded to them it wouldn't be much different. if the flat bed trailers can haul a tank they can have a tank chassis built on to it with a working turret and other guns. the first armored vehicles to be used in war were basically civilian vehicles with armor and guns welded onto them. hell there are current black ops vehicles that are civilian suvs with armor and guns attached. why not a big rig? russia and most of europe did it with rail cars and trains during world war i, and ii. pirates would take merchant vessels and put cannons, flame throwers on them to attack other merchant vessels. ahh.....there's something to think about....all those ""pirate"" faction ships would be total crap if we were to use real world pirate examples lol. using movies as basis for game balance is far better than real life....."
10/18/2016,"those jerry rigged setups only work for as long as nothing shoots back.you can literally take one out with single grenade.armored or not, they can't take or deal anything close to the punishment that a dedicated war vessel can.that won't work either. recoil is a pita. and you can't accurately fire without a stable platform (which would necessitate you to actually stop and deploy ""arms"" like artillery to maintain stability).and you can still take out the front cab with a single grenade like you can with a pickup truck. it isn't built for war. put armor plates on it and you will need to upgrade the chassis to hold the extra weight. then you need to install a more powerful engine.at which point, it becomes unreasonably expensive. better to save costs by creating a dedicated platform with everything integrated. those are not made for ""war"" in a traditional sense. they are made to get in, get out, and only take damage from ""light weapons."" they will suffer against anything heavier (see: grenade).and they were laughably ineffective for multiple reasons (see: limited to tracks, train couldn't move when firing, reload was a pita, easy to interdict).and they all ran from dedicated war ships because they knew they could not actually fight.movies are made to ""look cool."" they are not good material for ship ""balancing."""
10/18/2016,"small arms fire like from light small turrets on a destroyer....hrmm....interesting....if pirates would run why is it that pirates namely npcs don't do that? most of the time they chill out and let you blow them up. the ai is pretty random on having them run away to fight another day. same goes for players, again if we wanted to balance ships based on real life than there would be very big changes that people would like or ""think"" looked cool. again its a game, why not."
10/18/2016,"""small arms"" in rl would be thinks like pistols, m16s, and ak-47s.so yeah... ""small"" class weapons would count.as for the pirate npcs...eve is a distopian setting. pirates are running military hardware equivalent to the npc navies.(imagine if somolian militias has us tech and hardware)but, according to the lore, most pirate npcs are ""traditionally manned"" ships with most of the crew being conscripts or the ""dregs of society""... not capsuleers. so that is supposed to explains why we are faster, tankier, and hit harder than they can. we are optimized and trained. they are not.gameplay-wise... because your typical filthy casual and nubbin don't want to enconter an npc that can kill them. so they are made as easy as possible.and i think you are still missing the point.we had balancing done on ""because it would be cool"" some odd years ago. some of the worst, overpowered / fit of the month ships came about from this. it was not fun. it was frustrating.edit: also... rl pirates during the privateer age did not run from military vessels because they were ""pirates.""they ran because it is very, very dumb to directly engage a dedicated war vessel with a retrofitted kludge of a combat vessel.there is a reason why q-ships (see: combat retrofitted merchant ships) were discontinued and written off as an ineffective tactic; because they only had surprise on their side and relied heavily on a hostile ship wanting to capture rather than kill them.a pt boat could have killed one!"
10/18/2016,"jin'taan, in a probably futile effort to get this thread back on a semblance of topic (seriously people, make a new thread for your latest ""nerf ganking"" idea), i would like to ask you if you could provide any information or feedback that came out of this roundtable, and the first one as well. reading the csm minutes, it seems that highsec criminal mechanics were not discussed at all outside of the impact of alpha clones on the practice. the only discussion of the actual mechanics of highsec crime (that made it into the minutes at least) seems to be a completely inaccurate graph showing the number of attackers vs. isk lost. almost certainly that shows all highsec freighter losses, not just those due to suicide ganks (given you can't gank a rhea with 4 attackers), and since wardec losses make up a large fraction of highsec freighter kills, especially jump freighter kills, the graph is really not useful. regardless, i would appreciate it if you could find the time to report what feedback you collected on this issue from your two roundtables whether or not you had the opportunity to present it to ccp."
10/19/2016,"okay, so you want your station wagon with a .50 cal to be as combat effective as a vehicle designed specifically for combat.no.and. this. is. a. video. game. not. the. real. world.and an armed merchant vessel is fine for attacking other merchant vessels...not so much for an actual...you know...naval vessel.and yeah, it is a game, but it should still be balanced. you are advocating for imbalance."
10/19/2016,"i can see you never played dust. when an orbital strike was called in it was from a destroyer. they were not ""small arms"". have you looked at a size chart for the ships in eve. the smallest autocannon in the game is a 125mm gun. that would put it on par with some of the largest tank cannons we have today....and that is the small stuff. the biggest autocannon that can go on a frigate is a 200mm gun. the largest artillery is 280mm. and this is not even considering the ammo. for example the fusion warhead is basically an artillery shell with a fusion warhead in it. compared to this kind of weaponry you might as well be pissing in the wind with that .50 cal.as for pirates in this game you do understand that they are essentially sov holding entities like the empires. they do not just put out cobbled together glue fits, but field actual battleships, dreads and so forth. you are comparing them to rl pirates who had nothing equivalent.and balancing on ""real life"" is just not going to happen. hell the physics for this game really has us all flying underwater...in case you didn't notice. and even in ""real life"" a support vessel in the navy would not have the armament to deal with a dedicated combat ship."
10/19/2016,"the thing that would most help ccp get and retain people is to get someone in from statistics iceland to teach them how to do a survey and how to objectively examine the results.the survey of 8000 people, how did they determine these 8000. was it a random sample? chosen via some other means etc..the output data, less than 1% answered ganking. how many didn't answer? how many said things that might incorporate this such as game mechanics or your game sux? what was the primary answer these 8000 gave for leaving?the better non-npe questions ccp would already have the data or should have the data for are:how many people leave within a few days of a gank? do people know how to tank a ship? how many are solo. how many in small corps, how many in large?what is the profile of the customer likely to spend the most? what do these people want? do they pvp/pve? are they casual players or hardcore? never assume anything.however given the levels of bias in some areas of ccp they are probably better handing the data and a wad of cash to statistics iceland and asking for an analysis.the other things they need to do is become part of the 21st century where overt forum moderation, like deletion of social media comments is considered a black mark against a company and the other is the same problem they always had and that was world class horrible customer service.and remember statisticians do it by the numbers"
10/19/2016,"seriously, you probably misrepresented that study in every way possible. i don't even address your points since i start to believe that you are just a troll who deliberately lies to get a reaction.if you are not a troll then you should probably watch the video once again and correct your post."
10/19/2016,"actually i did play dust514 and i believe it is still installed on my ps3. you are talking about two different games, also two different forms of combat. i was using a .50cal as an example to illustrate that it is possible to tack weapons on to a vehicle that would normally not have the ""hard"" points for those weapons.small arms when it comes to a ship like naval ships would be a 5in deck gun like you see on the front of a destroyer which is about the same size as as your 125mm rail guns, or the same size as a modern day m1's 125mm smooth bore. the larger guns like the 8 and 10in main guns on cruisers or the big bad 16s on the mighty mo. are your larger weapons. due to the armor thickness on cruisers, battle cruisers, and battleships. the guns on frigates and destroyers wouldn't do much except kill the people that were exposed on the decks of the large vessels. most of the time the frigates and destroyers were used as small escort vessels for convoys, or as over the horizon scouts for the big boys. this would give the large guns a visual spotting aid. again this is wwii era naval vessels if you want to talk colonial we can, or modern. every naval vessel has its pros and cons that could be analyzed and help balance this game with its futuristic weapons.in regards to q-ships they were extremely effective against the nazi u boats. a torpedo cost a lot of money and they only had a few on board. when attacking a merchant vessel they would first surface and use the deck gun on the u-boat. this is why a lot of wwii subs had a deck gun. the q-ship would mount frigate/destroyer size weapons like a 5 inch gun usually 1 to 3 turrets worth that the would cover with mock truck cut outs. so that they would appear to be a cargo vessel. when the u-boat would surface they would move the covers out of the way and blow the pour bastards out of the water. this is why modern subs no longer have surface weaponry. when the subs stop coming up the use for a q-ship went away. if you are ever in the chicago land area hit up the museum of science and industry they have a captured u-boat u-505 which you can walk through and tour as well as lots more information about naval combat. if you are on the east cost there is the uss intrepid which has more naval air history than naval combat engagement history. i believe there is something similar on the west coast as well.weather we use real world to balance, or movies we can all agree that the balancing does need fixing when it comes to ships, overall combat in the game etc. the industrial vessels need some serious work, as do many other types and classes of vessels in this game."
10/19/2016,"no. the plan was for the two games to become integrated over time. that people playing dust would even take part, iirc, in taking and holding sov.and my point is that such a ship would be no match for a combat dedicated ship, you have not implicitly agreed to that. oh, and there are haulers in the game where you can put guns on them. of course, they won't stand up very well to a dedicated combat ship, but you can do it.so get out there and go roaming looking for trouble in a battle badger."
10/19/2016,look a person who does not understand statistics complaining about others doing statistics.
10/19/2016,"but politicians complain that people didn't answer the questions the way they were supposed to, and argue the opposite instead."
10/19/2016,"no politicians and media organisations cherry pick the statistics that they want and ignore the reasons they occured or ignore the more important statistics that don't tell the story that they want to. they used to complain that people didn't answer like they were supposed to now they just assume most people are idiots and they are right.national accounts are a great example of this. where politicians and the media tell people how well things are going by pointing to growth in gdp figures. even though that growth has only occured because the economy is in such a crappy state that no one can afford to buy imported goods. so the gdp goes up because even though exports have fallen, imports have fallen even more and that imbalance causes a rise in gdp even though the internal economy is flat or going backwards."
10/19/2016,"yeah we were aware these stats were odd/non reflective, thanks to having asked a lot of questions from gankers in the run up to this. effectively it just came to us not asking the question of the data in quite the right way. a lot of the people who knew how best to torture eve's big data in the csm have left, so we made a few pretty simple errors. i'm hoping that we'll be able to work on this in the next summit and get some better input, especially given the influx of data points from alphas."
10/19/2016,glad to see some one on the eve radio team running
10/19/2016,
10/19/2016,
10/20/2016,"the fact you wrote that shows you should never use statistics as you do not understand them.sample, size, selection and relevance are normal parts of statistical analysis as areresponse rates and bias (both internal and external). while there are many others i will keep this simple.the fact that we do not know how these 8000 were chosen is by itself troubling. we know they were looking at npe but did these accounts die after the trial period, how many were reactivated, continued ect..how many of these accounts were done by recruiting a friend, how many were blind? while they may be statistically valid, we don't really know. subsequently they cannot be taken to be real, because we don't know.in the less than 1% stated ganking statistic, what is the percentage of no response, how many stated similar things? you see without knowing what is searched for you cannot determine bias and without knowing the response rate you cannot determine the validity of the samples or the margin of error. if say 10% answered and 1% said ganking then that is a big thing, while if 90% answer and 1% say ganking then it is no big deal.that is why i said they should consult statistics iceland. their current outputs are limited to say the least.with the new free to play starting in a few weeks people should have to provide basic information to create an account just like microsoft require. call it to make a ""better service"". things such as name, sex, income, country and then this should be linked to accounts and then when an account becomes dormant for a few weeks a survey should be sent to determine why.from that they can actually build better statistics and a better game. as for the players we really cannot validate their statistics especially given the bias that exists within ccp on all sides of the spectrum.after all i am sure their management would wish to know the income and play styles of the 8% or so that will spend money on the game to support those that don't pay for it.statistics will also add weight to the csm, while the csm ""influence"" ccp, there are times were they shouldn't and statistics will show this and there are times were ccp should shut up and listen to the csm. the two that come to mind are incarna and the pos debacle.as to the forums themselves. ccp should listen to the feedback on their dev blogs as that always seems to hit the nail on the head but the majority of it is just wasted space. take the current ganking argument. there are those on the forums who hate it. those who love it and don't want it changed at all. those who want it made easier and those that want it made harder. pure statistics is the answer, especially when you consider the fact that only about 10% of a game population read the forums and around 3-5% actually comment.so really forum discussions are more about self interest than what ccp should ever listen too. they have an economist, well they need a statistician and one with some power to do things.the fact that this game is about to go free to play is a huge wasted opportunity if they do not include a survey in the account creation section."
10/20/2016,"yeah, well i don't think so. you see, in your hubris, you fail to realize that what you are talking about is not science, but scientism (and in case you don't know it, it is a bad thing).it is hard to know what effect ganking has on players, the player base and new players because we do not have the counter factual. that is we cannot do the following:have player joe log in and get suicide ganked on his 11th day in game.rewind the clock and have joe not get suicide ganked in his first 15 days.(the 15 days was what was used in that presentation by ccp at fanfest).in essence we cannot to a controlled experiment. at best, we can go for a ""natural experiment"". which is kind of what ccp tried to do.they took 80,000 individuals--i.e. not accounts, but subscribers so as to avoid problems with alt accounts. then they looked to see how many suffered a ship lost in their first 15 days. of the 80,00068,400 were not killed in their first 15 days.10,800 were killed legally--i.e. their killer was not in turn scorched by concord800 were ganked.of those three groups the ones who stayed with the game the longest were (in order):1. those ganked,2. those killed legally,3. those we did not die in their first 15 days.in addition, the ""fun fact"" of less than 1% of those leaving the game cited ship loss as the reason. in listening to the presentation it was not less than 1% of the 80,000, but less than 1% of everyone leaving the game. so your 8,000 players is really...well nothing.now, is it possible that there was some confounding factor at play here? sure. maybe those 800 players who were ganked were all in really good player corps....which probably helps retention. and maybe the same is true for those killed legally too. but given the numbers that strikes me as unlikely, especially if they picked a random sample of 80,000 subscribers.and the reason you pick such a large sample is so that when you do start breaking that sample down into sub-groups you will typically have enough so that you won't have a problem with a small sample. for example, if ccp had sampled just 1,000 subscribers they might end up with 10 or 11 guys who were ganked. with such a small number then the ""good corp"" problem (for example) could ruin your results. but when looking at 80,000 with almost 12,000 of them having been killed in their first 15 days you probably don't have to worry about that kind of a problem. of course, ccp could have used a stratified sampling approach, where they go in and look for subscribers in each category and randomly pick say 5,000 each.and yeah, there are additional factors that can come into play as well that could influence these results. age, marital status, job, etc. could all be factors. but again, with such a large number of players who were killed and ganked those effects are likely to be washed out. also, ccp does not have much of this data. they might be able to get age, but job and marital status? nope, probably not...at least not from what they get when a person signs up from the game.as for the rest of you questions like know how to tank a ship, that would require an extensive bit of surveying done when people quite....which would likely be quite costly and you always have the issue of those who simply refuse, is there something about those players that are biasing your results."
10/20/2016,"i am not talking about scientism, i am talking about statistical theory. scientism does not allow for a margin of error yes it was in relation to this 1% i was stating that not knowing the number of non-respondants and not knowing what was searched for, eg. was it just the word gank or was it piracy and ganking etc.. without that that 1% is meaningless. you said the magic word. if. the problem is we do not know how they came up with those 80,000 subscribers, random or otherwise.as to age, marital status etc.. that is something ccp should be collecting. ccp is a business and they should be making decisions based on sound statistical information. microsoft and a lot of other companies ask for income ect.. in signup these days and ccp should catch up with the times, maybe even giving some ingame bonus for people to complete it.yes non-response is always a factor as to whether something becomes statistically valid or not, as to cost most of what i have outlined can be done fairly cheaply via a simple database and then just queries to resolve it.after all it would lead to a better game and a more survivable ccp."
10/20/2016,"again, that <1% was for all subscribers who have left the game. not the 80,000 players ccp used for that presentation.so you going on about 8,000 highlights, that indeed, you do need to watch it again and refresh your memory.as for the 80,000...well i'm pretty sure ccp knows that picking subscribers randomly would be the best way. that is really basic stuff. considering they probably have had well over 1,000,000 cumulative subscribers.....and collecting demographic data is not costless. would it be awesome to have it? sure. but it comes with costs. first of all you have to risk losing subs if you make such information mandatory. if you don't then that whole issue you were worried about with regards to ""how the 8,000 were selected"" pops back up--that is responders vs. non-responders vs. outright liars. and if you hire a firm to do it, that is an obvious and direct cost too.i work for a company that has lots of customers and we don't go out collecting that kind of data. and we are a utility...some people might think we'd have that data. how many people in the house, what kind of appliances, etc. but we typically don't have that data. if we want it we have to go to a vendor who has collected some of that data."
10/20/2016,"no i was referring to the 1% of all subscribers. how many leave the game and say nothing? how many said something that might incorporate ganking?as to random for the 80,000 you assume it was random. that makes the statistic worthless, yes random is the best but there is no proof either way that is what was used.as to costless, i did not say that but it would in the long run cost them less than their wild stabs in the dark have cost them over the years. as to mandatory, would you lose that many on sign up to a free game for that information? probably not. you would have to calculate the trend line and error margin to exclude erroneous data, from liars.as to a firm they should not need to do that. statistics iceland would probably bend over backwards to help them as would many phd students.as to your own work place, i guarantee they can tell you the average power usage on any minute on any day of the week on any street and given the country you are from may have required a credit check before connecting the power which has all sorts of useful items on it, depending on country.simple web forms by companies are occuring more and more, same as shopper rewards cards ect.. data is valuable and you are better to have it and not need it than you are to need it and not have it."
10/20/2016,maybe you should consider thinking like a bayesian.....
10/21/2016,"no something i have much use for, it is primarily used to determine probabilities with unknown paramaters.i am no astrophysicist or weather forecaster. subsequently i have never really studied bayesian statistics.i will admit it is an interesting concept for modelling especially things such as percentage of smokers (rising or falling) given a tax rate, using other economic indicators such as unemployment rates, cpi and the immigration rate. especially given that the levels of immigration to a country from other countries with variable smoking rates varies from country to country."

10/28/2016,"again, there's no timer for jumping to.a clone in the same citadel"
10/28/2016,"hello i am a new player too eve. i am not a new player to games have played since the first game systems hit the market.i have been playing now for about 3 months and have spent money on the game and allot of time. that means i enjoy it.as a new player i realized that i need to focus on a few ships due to the lack of skill points i have vs someone that has been here for years. so as a pvp ship i focused on trying to get all the skills to fly i svipul and fly it well enough to do something. i didn't know that they where considered op or whatever. so now i hear the ship is to be nerfed. and nerf so bad as to not be useful. so i ask what did i do deserve to be punished and have the time i just spent trying to get into this game taken away?instead of nerfing you made the mistake not me ""buff others"". doesn't it seem better to reward a bunch rather then punishing a few. this is not to complaint i have played many games that nerf peoples classes. have u ever noticed after nerfs to peoples classes in all games those people seem to fade away and quit the game.ever seen a bunch of people quit a game after getting buffed."
10/28/2016,"the svipul was/is overpowered. you're not being punished, you're having your unfair advantage taken away.that said, it's not going to be useless afterwards. it just won't be as strong."
10/28/2016,"buffing everything to bring one ship into line is a hideous idea.because it leads to power creep. and you can't just compare a single ship class, ignoring the others. so you'd have to buff pretty much _everything_ in game."
10/28/2016,"if you didn't know they were op then what drew you to the svipul? it will still look the same it will still fill the role it was made for, it just isn't the kill everyone else ship it was, but you have lost nothing of that since you didn't know and thus want that anyways, right?key thing is we don't want one ship to rule them all. we want them to be balanced and choices to be made about which to fly and what will counter what. steve, above, is right. balancing is not always about adding more but sometimes trimming back. that is what happened in this case and i seriously doubt that the ship has become unflyable, just it is not the overpowered beast it once was.m"
10/28/2016,"good question, what is the role of the svipul? the nerf sounds not that bad (though i have not tested the new stats yet), but i'm a bit salty that hecate and jackdaw (with rig) are allowed to keep their instawarp while svipul and confessor got the mode switch trick removed without compensation. this together with the new scram vulnerability removes the potential as general purpose solo roaming ship in the era of infiniscrams."

10/29/2016,"you're literally arguing that the game should be left unblanced or else ""those people"" (we're perfectly well aware you're referring to yourself here) will quit in a huff."
10/29/2016,"ship balancing is not a reward or a punishment. i cannot imagine the level of self entitlement that is required to think you are being punished by ccp while they are trying to balance the game and make it more playable and enjoyable for everyone.at any rate, if history is any indicator, there will be a new fotm. you can train for that.eve is like an addiction; you can't quit it until it quits you. also, iderno"
