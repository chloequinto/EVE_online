11/1/2010,supported ever since i laid eyes on one the current monstrosities in 2006
11/1/2010,still broken
11/1/2010,"more bumping.though... black ops is fine as a weak deployment vehicle. hell, if you made it both weaker in combat terms but made it a better deployment vehicle, it would be much more awesome:step 1: remove all turret/bay hardpoints, so top slots can only equip probes/utility stuffstep 2: remove drone baystep 3: double the base jump range, maybe more. cut fuel costs to 10% or so of current.step 4: add a bay to distribute bombs/ammo to other members of the fleet.there, fixed. black ops is now the raft that carries in the special forces for covert missions, rather than an orange-painted raft with two machine guns buckled to the sides for no apparent reason. doesn't need a covops cloak, really, bonus to velocity is fine, from what i've seen from the guy that runs ours."
11/1/2010,"no.and not because i'm a dinosaur, or afraid of change. eve is not to be measured by the standards of other mmorpgs. it would make them all look bad. keep it that way. keep innovating, ccp. don't borrow a half-arsed business model aimed at pre-pubescents presumably incapable of addition."
11/1/2010,nooh please no
11/1/2010,"no microtransaction's games are generally free to play, giving transactions a reason to occur. eve is far to be free to play !!"
11/1/2010,no!
11/1/2010,no.
11/1/2010,no a strong no to all this nonsense

11/1/2010,"no.people play eve to get away from that garbage. there are plenty of ""microtransaction""/wow/pretty pony games for people who like that. keep eve uninfected!"
11/1/2010,no
11/1/2010,"not that this thread necessarily needs it, but i feel a bump is in order"
11/1/2010,"supported. motherships should have been half the size of titans, at least. carriers should be equal to or slightly bigger than dreads in size."
11/1/2010,"supporting the second idea. would make it easier to uh, compare things..."
11/1/2010,compare tool would be 1337!!
11/1/2010,"sounds sweet! much easier than opening every ship from the market, or auto linking, and messing with the windows so you can see the stats."
11/1/2010,capital idea chap.
11/1/2010,"oh, come on! the male/female split in eve is bad enough as it is! do we really need more testosterone? meh. supported edit: actually, i'm going to suggest that the increase be provided by resists, rather than by a straight increase in hp. it's not like remote hull repair is going to get a sudden boost because someone has 80% hull resists instead of 60%, and it'd save some very remote repair pilots a few hours...taking a leaf from the slave set's bonuses we derive:rambo alpha: 1% bonus to hull resistsrambo beta: 2% bonus to hull resistsrambo gamma: 3% bonus to hull resistsrambo delta: 4% bonus to hull resistsrambo epsilon: 5% bonus to hull resistsrambo omega: 1.5x bonus to rambo set bonusesfollowing the slave bonus pattern, that would give a 34.04% bonus. however, as i'm suggesting a resist bonus instead of a straight multiplier, we have to take the reciprocal, account for diminishing returns ... after which it corresponds to approximately a 51.6% bonus to hull ehp.okay, yeah, values would need to be tweaked. still, awesome idea. =p"
11/1/2010,more stuff?good stuff!~o~
11/1/2010,"eve's not about being ""fair.""but it is about providing a full sf background for our silly pvp and pve shenanigans.so i'm not going to complain too much even if ""concord passes new rules of engagement"" and the orca providing the hot-swap now goes blinky red, even though i never mine and trained up two orca pilots in different alliances just to hot-swap and/or move groups of ships in high sec. if i whine because concord now treats me like an accessory to an incident when i actually am one, then i'm just being silly. and i agree with the point that people shouldn't be able to continuously swap out ships in the middle of combat without being insta-podded.so though it may be unfair to some piwates to close this loophole, i'd not whine about it.but i'd really, really love it (and consider using the trick) if the orca only went blinky-red aggression-wise if it were on the same grid, and was able to hot-swap with impunity elsewhere in the system. ;)"
11/1/2010,"yes lets wardec federal navy academy, right?seems like risk averse wardeccers at work here. eve is supposed to be harsh and all that, so if you directly aid flagged people in your mining support ship you also should be flagged and not be too scared of combat."
11/1/2010,"not supported, ooc alts need a nerf. especially in hi-sec wars."
11/1/2010,"i support the original proposal in part 1 also, support this sentiment..."
11/1/2010,"while you're at it, make giving fleet bonuses pull aggro too, and cap bounties on npc's killed in highsec at 300k so that griefer decs (and thus development time spent on aggro mechanics) become largely unnecessary."
11/1/2010,i wouldn't be surprised if this could cause client-side graphical lag during busy fleet fights......but that's hardly reason to remove support for the feature entirely. just have it be one of those performance-tweakables in the options menu. +1.
11/1/2010,"+1if it indeed causes client-side lag, make it optional, but bring it back."
11/1/2010,"yes, but that's hardly an excuse to deny them a proper damage bonus as well.considering that legions don't have the powergrid to use a beam laser configuration, i hardly see the relevance in comparing their long-range tracking characteristics. besides, who ever heard of a covert sniper? this discussion is about the covert ops subsystem. stay topical.and yet missiles can, as well. when 50% (minmatar, caldari) of eve can change damage types, the inability to do so is a significant disadvantage to a given weapon systems. this is made worse by the fact that the laser damage is so variable in effectiveness (utterly useless against armor and t2 minmatar resists), whereas kinetic and thermal are always at least moderately useful...and yet when ships have powergrid and cpu to spare, they opt not to use the supposedly ""better"" laser weapons systems, instead going with autocannons. doesn't that strike you as odd? it is absolutely relevant. when ships lack compelling damage bonuses to their racial weaponry, they consistently choose autocannons. you see this not only on the myrmidon, but also on the punisher, the maller, and the prophecy -- all ships which get a 50% capacitor bonus and ignore it entirely. i would wager that you could take capacitor out of the equation entirely (100% bonus) and they would still opt for autocannons because of the improved tracking, easier fitting requirements, and selectable damage.i was obviously being facetious. the fact that you seriously thought i was suggesting nerfing the omen makes me question whether you have the grounds to discuss any turret platform, laser or otherwise."
11/1/2010,"i mean precisely what i said. the legion has 5 effective turrets, the proteus has 6.25. that's a 20% loss in damage output relative to the other covert strategic cruiser platforms. it's basic algebra, your inability to perform it probably has something to do with your position in this debate. when something lacks a 25% damage bonus, it has a 20% loss in dps. take the reciprocal. of course, if you want to compare to the loss of a 25% rof bonus, then then it's actually a 25% loss in effective turrets. however, given the disadvantages of a high rof (capacitor use, ammo use, reload time), i felt it more reasonable to compare it to the proteus's bonus, rather than the loki's or tengu's.and while you may certainly argue that examining effective turrets ignores the variations between turret types...haven't i already established that in the absence of any other determining factor (such as meaningful ship-specific damage bonuses, and abundant powergrid and cpu), autocannons are the short-range weapon of choice?if i haven't, then let me make it abundantly clear: the punisher, the maller, the prophecy, and the myrmidon all use autocannons. indeed, you will even see autocannons replacing blasters on caldari platforms like the merlin, the moa, and the ferox. they do it because their mediocre weapons bonuses don't give them sufficient reason not to. projectiles offer superior tracking and range, combined with lower pg/cpu/capacitor costs and selectable damage type. when people can use them without giving up vital ship bonuses, they do.let me now remind you that the covert legion also lacks compelling ship weapon bonuses. doesn't the earlier comment about the myrmidon seem awfully relevant now? yes, i believe it does.what makes the covert legion subsystem so unforgivable is that all these other platforms have some other bonus provided to them -- typically a resist bonus. that is a gank/tank tradeoff, something wholly inadequate for a covert strategic cruiser. as such, the covert legion needs some laser bonus that compels it to retain its signature weapon type. a range bonus would let it use higher grade crystals and give it the dps advantage necessary to make lasers a compelling alternative to autocannons."
11/1/2010,"the funny thing is that it's not about the range. anyone who thinks that it is completely misunderstands the amarrian weapons system.for lasers, more than any other weapon type, range is damage -- because with an instant crystal swap, you turn turn any excess optimal into a higher damage multiplier.the choice of a range increase was threefold:provide a unique bonus that differentiates the covert legion from its counterpart t3sremain consistent with the amarrian tradition by adopting the offensive bonuses of the armageddonlimit the scope of the buff to make it more psychologically acceptable. heavyhanded buffing is bad. (projectiles!!)"
11/1/2010,"completely irrelevant! produce an autocannon fitted covert ops legion that out performs a pulse laser fitted legion and it becomes almost relavent. even then, the relavence of such a fitting pattern is to prove that the legions bonuses do not need to be changed. if the problem exists on more ships than just the legion, it is not the legion that needs fixing, it is pulse lasers.if you want to prove your point, then produce a viable comparison that shows an autocannon legion out performing a pulse laser legion. otherwise, compare full fittings, not contextless bonues. the 20% difference that you cite is meaningless. you need to apply those bonuses to actually fittings for any comparison to have meaning. provide a comparison of actual dps, tracking and range if you want your comparison to be worthwhile.also remember the intended role of pulse lasers. if you want your turrets to work at bumping range, then you picked the wrong race to train for. if you want them to work at web or scram range, then you will find pulse lasers are at their optimal while the others are falling off fast."
11/1/2010,"very well, please allow me to do precisely that.consider the following legion fitting. it has a relatively impressive 102k ehp and boasts a 2218 m/s speed under mwd. however, due it achieves only a lackluster 319 dps with faction multifrequency, reaching out to a paltry 8.63+6.5km range. tracking is 0.32 rad/s, and the high powergrid/capacitor requirements of lasers force two compromises onto the fitting:it has insufficient pg to use the augmented capacitor reservoir subsystem, and must instead utilize the power core multiplierit has insufficient capacitor to fly without a capacitor booster, even before you consider the dangers of energy neutralization.[legion, covertlazor]legion defensive - augmented platinglegion electronics - dissolution sequencerlegion engineering - power core multiplierlegion offensive - covert reconfigurationlegion propulsion - chassis optimizationheavy pulse laser ii, imperial navy multifrequency mheavy pulse laser ii, imperial navy multifrequency mheavy pulse laser ii, imperial navy multifrequency mheavy pulse laser ii, imperial navy multifrequency mheavy pulse laser ii, imperial navy multifrequency mcovert ops cloaking device iiy-t8 overcharged hydrocarbon i microwarpdrivewarp scrambler iitrue sansha medium capacitor booster, cap booster 800tracking computer ii, optimal rangetracking computer ii, tracking speedarmor thermic hardener iiimperial navy energized adaptive nano membraneimperial navy heat sinkimperial navy heat sink1600mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates imedium trimark armor pump imedium trimark armor pump imedium trimark armor pump i"
11/1/2010,"i don't use because i don't think its a good choice given its lack of 'zazz'. however, i'd be willing to try it some more if you are implying it is more useful than it seems, aside from the obvious tactical advantage a covops cloak grants pilots.i honestly would rather fly a stealth bomber, from a cost effectiveness standpoint.edit 1: wordingedit 2: stealth bomber comment added"
11/1/2010,"now consider this fitting. due to the ludicrously low powergrid requirements of autocannons, the engineering subsystem can either remain (allowing for additional plating) or be swapped for the augmented capacitor reservoir, as i have done here. i opted for this configuration so that the tank and number of damage mods would remain identical.moreover, the lack of capacitor use (nevermind the addition of the augmented capacitor reservoir) allows the legion pilot to forgo the medium capacitor reservoir. even after doing so, the setup remains cap stable at an astonishing 50.6%, microwarpdrive and all! note that the use of capacitor-free guns makes energy neutralization less of a threat, as well. in exchange, the empty midslot can now be fitted with a stasis web, all the better for striking at small targets the legion would otherwise struggle with (no drone bay in any decent subsystem configuration).finally, note the scripts in the tracking computers. despite the fact that both are fitted for optimal range, this autocannon configuration actually achieves identical tracking to the laser loadout. what it improves on is range, accomplishing an incredible 2.0+19.7km range. with barrage, it strikes out to 3.9+29.5km.for all this, it need only sacrifice 10.4% of its dps output, dropping to 286 dps. do you really mean to imply that lasers are still the weapon of choice under the covert subsystem configuration?[legion, covertauto]legion defensive - augmented platinglegion electronics - dissolution sequencerlegion engineering - augmented capacitor reservoirlegion offensive - covert reconfigurationlegion propulsion - chassis optimization425mm autocannon ii, republic fleet emp m425mm autocannon ii, republic fleet emp m425mm autocannon ii, republic fleet emp m425mm autocannon ii, republic fleet emp m425mm autocannon ii, republic fleet emp mcovert ops cloaking device iiy-t8 overcharged hydrocarbon i microwarpdrivewarp scrambler iistasis webifier iitracking computer ii, optimal rangetracking computer ii, optimal rangearmor thermic hardener iiimperial navy energized adaptive nano membranerepublic fleet gyrostabilizerrepublic fleet gyrostabilizer1600mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates imedium trimark armor pump imedium trimark armor pump imedium trimark armor pump i"
11/1/2010,"@ op, you know something is wrong when you get better effectiveness fitting autocannons to an unbonused ship. brings me back to the bad old days when projectiles on an apoc was considered correct."
11/1/2010,"as a reminder, i'd like to point out that these fittings should not even be close. a t3 offensive subsystem provides tremendous bonuses to its pilot. using the tengu's accelerated ejection subsystem as an example, a level 5 skill literally doubles your damage output with missiles.even the more modest covert configuration derives a 33% damage bonus from training the relevant subsystem skill to 5. these fittings should not even be comparable -- the laser setup should blow the autocannon setup out of the water."
11/1/2010,"sadly, that's almost universally true -- and moreover, the legion, the punisher, and the maller are not unbonused ships in the first place! they all ""benefit"" from the 50% capacitor use bonus, and you can see the effect (or lack thereof) in the use profile of their turrets."
11/1/2010,"i also ran a comparison of those two setups. to ensure a more favorable assessment for the autocannon setup, i dropped one of the tracking computers on the lazer setup so that both setups had a statis webifier.i agree that it is fair to switch the engineering subsystem and cap booster for the autocannon setup. however, i disagree that the change will decrease the threat of energy neutralization. the lack of cap booster would increase the danger of energy neutralization. while your weapons would continue to function without cap, your mwd, web and scram will fail. if you faced a real threat with energy neutralization, the result would be your death or your opponents retreat. keeping the cap booster would shift the resulting conclusion further in favor of the laser loadout.this is not an increase in range over the laser setup. the autocannons perform best within their optimal range. as the range increases past the autocannon's optimal range, the advantage of pulse lasers increases. at point blank range the lasers have a 11.3% damage advantage over the autocannons. at 9km (scram range) the lasers have a 21.4% advantage over the autocannons. at 24km (disruptor range) the lasers have a 53.6% damage advantage. going past that range, lasers retain their advantage.looking back at your specific proposal: how does giving the legion a range bonus improve on the current balance, given that it already has significantly better range than is needed for the role you are describing, especially if that range bonus comes at the cost of the capacitor bonus that it already has? there might be grounds for a 5% to 10% boost to pulse laser damage across the board, but there does not appear to be any grounds for the suggested range bonus to be added to the legion's covert ops subsystem."
11/1/2010,"not supported. horrible ideas, leave learning skills in just as they are, if people can't handle it eve is not for themnobody forces you to invest time in learning skills to 5/5 just like nobody forces you to train racial cruiser to 5of course if you are not an idiot and want to get the most out of your character then at some point you will spend the time and do itthere seems to be some hidden implication in all this that learning skills need to be trained to 5/5 as soon as a character is created while doing nothing else but thatwhich is so dumb it's not funny, that is supremely flawed logic and i find it reprehensiblei see this thread, a microtransactions thread and a plex for remap thread on the first page alone, wtf is this cancer ccp? do you think i have spent thousands of hours and thousands of dollars on this game over the years because i thought it was subpar and didn't like the way it worked?give it a rest you jokers ha ha ha ha ha"
11/1/2010,you should read the press releases ccp has said you don't matter as much as new players.
11/1/2010,"very supported.simply put, the learnings are a fossil of an era long gone and place a huge burden on new players. not only this but the arguments for keeping them often come from trolls with 3 or 4 accounts and titans/carriers/whatever already trained that would like to share their grief and misery about the bad old days with the world and that hate on every change that would make the game more accessible anyway.""it sucked for me and it should suck for everyone"" is not an argument, nor is the false ""you dont have to train them, have fun lulz derp"" choice.begone with them, refund skillpoints, and let the bittervets be bitter about one more thing."
11/1/2010,"supported.this solution makes a lot of sense. people who have learned the skills already will be reimbursed accordingly by having accelerated learning to regain those sp and newer players won't feel so daunted by the really horrible choice of being stuck in a frigate for 2 months while learning them, or suffering diminished skill gain rates in the future for ignoring them.it's already daunting enough coming in to the game as it is and making the realisation that it'll take 20 years to max out all learning and that there are players out there already with 7 years headstart on you. also knowing that to keep pace and not lose further ground, you effectively can't play as you'd prefer for 2 months adds salt to the wound so to speak.the system is a flawed design, it needs to change."
11/1/2010,"dear piloteers,tl;dr: ""wardec prices are too cheap, raise them to reflect current isk inflation""i know this is an old discussion, but i personally believe that the wardec mechanic for high sec needs many revisions. nevertheless, as 90% of eve makes it's money by either scamming, ganking, or destroying then old game mechanics need to be ""updated"" to the current market of today.the overall goal of this thread is to mention that there needs to be some kind of change to the wardec pricing mechanic. 2 million to wardec a corporation is just pennies on the dollar in eve. anyone can fart out 2 million if they know what they are doing. so an increase towards wardec pricing is due. this is because of eve's inflation and needs to be taken into consideration.possible proposals:increase the base cost and stacking costs for wardecs using this formula.b + (c * (w-1)) + (c * wo)where 100 million is the base cost for corporation on corporation wardecs. 200 million for the rest.c = 25 million for corporation on corporation wardecs, or 50 million for everything else.w = wars that the wardecie is currently in (including the one starting at the wardec).wo = wars the wardecd corp is currently in.pros:increases the cost for wardecs to current market inflation.will reduce the amount of grief wardecs and afk freighter wardecs.will make wardecs seem more reasonable compared to cheaper rates from before.wardecs are still cheap enough at these costs per week for novice corporations to be able to pool funds together and fight for a cause.significantly decreases the stacking penality for the new proposed cost while not increasing the cost for sustained alliance wardecers too mucha reasonable change that, hopefully, is not going to kill anyone's pocket pvp side and a much needed 'update' for the wardec mechanic for carebears.a simple code change that can be implemented in a matter of minutes, tested in a few hours, and fully incorporated within a day or two.cons:this will not eliminate grief wardecs entirely.newb corporations can not wardec for the lulz anymore.wardecs are still cheap.not a significant cost for many alliances to stop wardecing smaller corporations. (similiar to first point)will not stop corp hopping.the sliding rule concept:change the cost based on members in a corporation/alliance total amounts. impose maximum and minimal boundaries for cost (25-50 million for corporation on corporation wardecs no matter the size and maybe 50-100 million for alliances). stacking decs still occur.pros:increases the cost for wardecs to current market inflationwill reduce the amount of grief wardecs and afk freighter wardecs.will make wardecs seem more reasonable compared to cheaper rates from before.wardecs are still cheap enough at these costs per week for novice corporations to be able to pool funds together and fight for a cause.cons:a very time consuming measure that is not apart of the current game mechanics. instead of modifying a line of code, this becomes a new module. etc, etc.second biggest flaw: corp hopping for the wardecers will happen on a weekly basis to keep costs down, thereby skewing the results.grief decs will not go away.does not stop corporation hopping."
11/1/2010,"add one more thing, if 20 or more people from another corp aggress the corp that started the wardec they should be able to wardec the people who aggressed the corp with the 20 rrers instantly (no 24 hour waiting period). this would make it harder for rr to unlevel the battlefield."
11/1/2010,it does strike me as a bit odd that concord sanctioned combat is cheaper than a competently t2-fit rifter...
11/1/2010,"supported, very needed."
11/1/2010,not supported.if anything wardecs should be made cheaper. the fees should just be a token administrative fee not a barrier to declaring war. so long as high sec remains a major isk faucet it should become less safe not more so.
11/1/2010,not supported. this is pvp game and pvp should be cheap.
11/1/2010,"can't really support it. for any serious corp/alliance the suggested (raised) fee is still nothing but pocket change. heck, a couple thousand players could probably pay those fees out of their own private pockets for a good while. thus too pointless to make such a marginal adjustment."
11/1/2010,"to those who do not support the idea.towards pvp- yes eve is a pvp place, but for the majority of people in small corps who live in high sec pvp is not profitable towards the more industrious corps. nevertheless, the wardec mechanicis useful to heavy producers for ships that many high sec lovers use. destruction does mean sales, but 2 million per week is nothing and it leads to the point of less tactful wardecs to *let's wardec as many idiots as possible*. hence, grief engine.price - 200 a week is is still cheap. that is less than 30 mil a day.everything else, ssdd."
11/1/2010,gb2wowkthxbai
11/1/2010,"pvp is cheap. in fact it's completely free is vast swaths of the game universe.that said, just making war decs more expensive will not fix what's wrong with them. at your proposed prices (30 million a day, etc), i can pay for a weeks worth of war dec in an hour or so of playing the game."
11/1/2010,"so its been the norm for a hell of a long while (possibly since eves inception) that when in warp ur able to, and im sorry for the fps phrase here, no-clip through practically everything in eve.as a professional commercial computer game, i could understand this ""feature"" in an end user design environment. but not in an intended final product.buuuut as i know eve is constantly evolving from a product built an age ago, i know theres some deep routed things that will get re-coded eventually.now... to the detailed issue i wanted to bring up.eve online's warp feature seems, to an end user, to be almost indistinguishable from another space simulators faster than light flight feature.anyone familiar to the independence-war series of computer games by infogrames and particle systems will understand the stark similarities.the differences are the ftl warp feature in i-war was discretely controllable, as well as having an autopilot feature. particle systems warp function in i-war 2 could also navigate around obstacles without dropping out of warp as a feature of the autopilot.i do not know if the coding behind it is similar to ccp's coding for the warp feature in eve online. i could only assume its relatively similar.what im stressing is that the warp around objects had been achievable since the sequel i-war 2 released 2001.to recap:warping through planets, moons, stations and ships makes eve online seem inferior in quality and breaks the feel of a physical interactive universe.other developments from the same time as eves inception with the a similar feature (in form and execution) had solved this issue.cheers for reading, i know this doesn't impact gameplay, and such things should be prioritized before this, but a solution as far as i know should be simple, easy to implement, and very much achievable.it would help with the quality and immersive nature of the game.flame on!"
11/1/2010,"supported, would make the immersive nature of the game as you put it, alot better. warping through a station/planet does kinda kill that a bit hehe"
11/1/2010,"i think this would involve more resources to implement that it would be worth. consider how many celestials there are in eve you'd have to ""warp around"". the load on resources would probably be extreme. we already have problems with lag in the game. lets not add things that could add to peoples' performance problems that aren't really necessary."
11/1/2010,i have no problem if ccp wants to take this on after several older and imo more pressing features/issues are looked at with the added requirement of allowing us to initiate 'blind' warps of which we can set a default possibly with a 'max' range of a few thousand kilometers.if you are going to prevent us from warping through stations/ships/clutter in space then we need to be able to get 'away' from those that would make use of this new feature to keep you from warping.
11/1/2010,1
11/1/2010,"heyy!as far as i know planetary systems have huuuuuge bodies of matter and because of that.. the effects of them should reflect on eve onlines day to day activities.im unsure if planetary bodies in eve actually orbit or if thats just a non functioning property of planets at the moment. what i am proposing are more areas that have, not unexplained phenomena, but phenomena that can be explained rationally... for example:1 - warping to 0m on a sun (although i know u don't literally do that) should cause a continual thermal effect and thermal damage to shields etc... high radiation near a huge fireball caused by a fusion reaction should also have obvious effects on other sensor systems.2 - certain planets (gas) with very low orbit moons should exert electromagnetic/electrostatic fields between them. point in case would be jupiter and its moon io. this situation could be a point in case to have warp points in such situations to have em damage fields in those areas. others can be brainstormed but the idea is there.these and other system features can provide different tactical opportunities as well... further enriching the end user experience.btw im not a pvp wannabe thats looking for ways to gain an advantage... just a logical thinker that realizes if ur gonna be diving into a stars corona... u should at least feel a bit hot under the collar.flame on! muhuhahahaha!"
11/1/2010,it won't fix anything.
11/1/2010,"as a same account hauler alt of alara i aprove this message!seriously anything will help at this point, this should not be allowed. but here i am re-supporting a cause!"
11/1/2010,"pointless idea without some way of also preventing people doing the same thing over multiple accounts.besides in serious discussions, rare they may be here, reasoned good arguments remain reasoned good arguments whether posted by a ""main"" or an ""alt"", and posting for or against such an argument with a dozen alts doesn't change a good argument to a bad one, or a bad one to a good one."
11/1/2010,1
11/1/2010,"well, the forums are already crap because of the people who post in them. i don't see how this would hurt (it can only get better from here), so i support it.only, make sure that you only implement this in sections of the forum that have debates. i.e. leave character bazaar, recruitment, etc. open to alts also.edit: i would also make it so that anyone who posts off topic or something that doesn't add anything to the discussion at all (i.e. a random ""this is a pointless thread"" or ""this is in the wrong section"" and simply ending with that) should be deleted, and the account be warned."
11/1/2010,"just limit it so only the char with most sp on the account can post, alt posting fixed."
11/1/2010,"so for example if verone got a character on his account with more sp than him, verone would never be able to post on the eve-o forums again? more sp does not equate to main character.as i always say with this argument, if i can use an alt ingame to spy/scout/steal/scam (the four s's of great justice) then i should be able to use an alt to post as well. either get rid of all alts or allow them all, getting emo over an alt that got you riled up on the eve-o forums is pathetic. htfu."
11/1/2010,"people should read the proposal it isn't about forcing the use of a main character by sp or age or anything it is about limiting responses to a thread to one character per account, ffs there is even a tldr version.you want to force 'mains' to post make your own proposal and i will gladly rant at you with how you are wrong and ignorant of why people don't want to be forced to do that."
11/1/2010,i'm just pushing it to the limit to show what a stupid idea this is.
11/1/2010,fixed.

11/1/2010,this. i don't think what they've come out with is terrible. i think it is just not complete and needs to be finished.
11/1/2010,i think my reasoning for this to be looked into has been remarkably similar to ccp greyscales reasoning. i guess he must be trolling too.
11/1/2010,"btw to rehash because you have dragged this so far off the original point this is a small summation of jumpbridges and the problems they create.1. they promote extremely large scale fights which the server will never be able to handle.2. the larger a coalition gets the easier it is to move numbers, encouraging people to move towards this unplayable scale of conflicts3. this doesnt even make sense on any other model (rl or any other games i know of... because it is illogical)4. even should it not be just bad logic (which i assure you it is) it promotes an ""un-fun"" style of play. and i use the un-fun definition provided by you and your coalition. ie. long load times, lots of lag, 3k man gangs trying to fight on the same node...what would looking into jbs do probably?1. promote smaller scale conflicts (still large... just not as large)2. create more value to regions of space, eg closer to empire will be a more valuable (safer to travel too)3. benefits of holding space will be directly related to the act of actually holding space for yourself. - this isnt a super strong point i just like the idea of being able to justify use of your space by actually holding it. as opposed to just pretending to be ""friends"" with another entity so you can get all the benefits they do for holding their own space.you say i can make a choice adapt or die, well i say there should be a choice. and that choice should be to either be in an alliance or to not be in it. this middleground where you can just use blue alts / corps to derive benefits of not holding space circumvents consequences. which i think is a bad thing for a game like eve.in the end i think if it really came down to it, more people want their actions to actually count ingame. being as ccp greyscale said ""just another cog creating lag"" is not what i believe eve was ever intended to be despite what you might say, and i think it is not the right way to go on to continue encouraging and rewarding the style of play that will lead to more and more unplayable fights."

11/1/2010,"according to patch notes for quantum rise released november 11, 2008, this is one of the changes:- important multi-part storyline missions have had their expiry timers increased to one month to allow for completion. -i searched through all the patch notes posted after that and did not see any retraction or changes made to it.it took a while for that to be implemented and as of now when offered a multi-part storyline mission such as the 10 part 'kidnappers strike', the expiration timer does indeed show 1 month. however, after completing part 1 the expiration timer shows 1 week and continues counting down from that for the other 9 parts. the way it stands now, have 1 month to accept and complete the 1st part of a 10 part storyline mission and then only have 1 week to accept and complete the other 9 parts. a lot of those parts are long missions and some players just don't have the time to complete all of those within 1 week. also the 1 month timer for part 1 isn't really helping much considering that the mission (part 1) can be completed easily within a few hours.i propose that the 1 month countdown timer continue counting down for all of the parts of the multi-part storyline missions. meaning that when offered, you have 1 month to accept and complete all the parts, not just part 1. i don't know how many parts in a storyline mission offer is required to be included in the 1 month expiration timer. maybe it's set at 6 or more parts. however i do know that the way the timer is set up now, it's just about worthless.thank you all for taking the time to read this."

11/1/2010,"can i suggest two additions:1. that the arrow pointing directly at the camera be unclickable.all too often i try to move the box by clicking on top and it grabs the arrow (handily in the centre of the area i'm supposed to click) and shoots off vertically - i then have to spend ages moving it back down to the plane.2. that the plane not cause the boxes and arrows to be dimmed if they're below it. it's often twice as hard to scan below the plane because you either need to squint to see the arrows/boxes, or you need to flip it upside down and move from underneath the plane."

11/1/2010,"i have a proposal for a way for players to create skillbooks. this would add to the sandbox aspect of eve by increasing the number of items in the game which are created by players.a new skill would be added to the game. this skill would be teaching. i'm a relatively new player, so maybe some more experienced members of the community could suggest appropriate prerequisites for this skill.in order to create a skillbook, you would have to have the skill you wish to create a book for at level v and the teaching skill. the level in teaching would determine how many books for that skill you can create (with v being an unlimited number) and/or how long it takes you to create each book. the books would have material components, which would be various electronics components (perhaps salvage items) since the books are digital and not paper.so, for example, to create a skillbook for mechanic, you would have to have mechanic v, teaching skill, and the appropriate materials."
11/1/2010,"there are two problems with this:1. who creates the teaching skill book? (think chicken and egg).2. you're going to have a hard time preventing abuse of new players - there is nothing really stopping me from making say minmatar cruisers and then charging 5 trillion isk a copy for the book. (yes, i know, someone else will make that particular book, but it's an example, bear with me). effectively, this means that no one who doesn't have that skill will ever get it.i'm a big supporter of the player driven economy in eve, but there are some things it just makes sense to have supplied by the game, not by the players.not supported."
11/1/2010,"1) the teaching skillbook would have to be seeded, which is no big deal considering all skill books are seeded at this point.2) although that is theoretically possible, all it takes is someone to undercut that person. you seem to assume, to use your example, that you'll be the only person making that book. obviously that won't be the case. additionally, the skillbooks could still be seeded until there are enough players with the ability to make them to make the economy of those items stable."
11/1/2010,"1. sort of defeats the purpose. if you're going to have on that's still seeded, you may as well leave the system the way it is.2. the pos fuel market would like to have a conversation with you about the inherent greed of the players in this game."

11/1/2010,"the idea is simple and probably has been brought up before. as it stands, pos are difficult to use at best, this is widely regarded as a fact. currently, tech 3 cruisers have no means of changing subsystems at pos. if an array was introduced that allowed players to dock, but had limited capacity like the ship maintenance array and the corporate hangar array, i feel that it would make it easier to use the pos fitting and storage mechanics, and allow tech 3 cruisers to change their subsystems. if some other workaround to the subsystem issue is developed, there would no longer be any reason for a docking array apart from the aesthetics of docking.edited for clarification"

11/2/2010,"so as bad as it sounds, i think hybrids in general need a gimmick. sure you could play with the base stats of range or tracking or damage, but then you run the risk of just making more of the same when you run into the other turrets. instead, give them something that is still of direct benefit, but without homogenizing the turrets still further.just as an off the wall example: take all the dedicated blaster ships like the brutix, deimos, etc. take away one turret slot, and upgrade the damage bonus from the hull to compensate. same damage, but now you use a little less cap, have a little easier fitting, and your ship is a little less expensive. you also have a spare utility high, always handy. but wait! this doesn't address the main problem with blasters, which is putting damage on target!true, so maybe that extra utility high can be migrated to a low or a mid. now that blaster ship has the spare fitting and slot for a speed mod or a web. if you really want to go overboard, reduce the cap usage of blasters a little more to offset the requirement of high usage on the mwd and scram+web.now you've maintained a unique close range niche for blasters but still boosted them.obviously this isn't a panacea, but i think this type of solution is far more promising than simply adding 10% more tracking or damage."
11/2/2010,"""10% more tracking and damage"" - is the simple possible solution. all other solutions look pretty complicated without braking existing game.as for gallente ships it looks strange: 1) armed with extremely short range weapon you should approach to enemy as soon as possible but ship bonuses and slot layouts tell you to use armor tank that means mass increasing, speed penalties because of armor rigs.2) first, there are less low slots comparing amarr ships and there are active tank bonuses on some ships so it supposed to fit active armor tank (if not let<U+FFFD>s switch to 5% resists?) <U+FFFD> it significantly consumes cap. second, mwd is highly recommended module for extremely short range weapon <U+FFFD> it significantly consumes cap. is it logical to fit cap consuming weapon on such ships? 3) lasers (pulse) shoot farther than projectiles (ac). lasers have slower tracking. projectiles have faster tracking. ok it is logical. (mega pulse on abaddon = 0.04219, 800mm on maelstrom = 0.054). but now<U+FFFD> projectiles (ac) shoot father than blasters. why blaster tracking = projectile (ac) tracking? (800mm on maelstrom = 0.054, neutron cannon on hyperion = 0.05412). it is logical shorter range - more tracking is needed."
11/2/2010,"i actually agree on most of this. blaster range causes a number of other problems that are only compounded by being on armor tanked hulls. if you go active armor tank, you have no cap stability at all. between the required mwd, tackle, and guns, trying to run any sort of realistic active tank is out of the question in many cases. however, running a buffer tank slows you down significantly, making it even harder to put damage on target.my point is that simply adding some random boost to tracking and damage isn't going to help blasters' primary downfall. yes blasters could benefit from tracking and damage, but that's just a band-aid fix to help the symptoms of poor damage application, rather than addressing the root cause that is cap-hungry, slow, armor tanked blaster boats. this stew of various problems has all now congealed into a general hybrid failure, and '10% of x variable.' is not really the cure. the weapon systems and ships need a large overhaul."
11/2/2010,support the idea with the dmgand bumping the thread
11/2/2010,"i do agree that something is needed to address the poor performance of hybrids but... i agree with herschel's assessment.look at the gun stats. look at the ship bonuses. if the guns match up properly but they fall out of line depending on the ships they are fitted on, fix the ship bonuses and not the guns.tweaking ship bonuses is a bit easier to live with than adjusting baseline guns. that can be applied on a ship-by-ship basis but guns... as you say, 50% of the races favor hybrids for their weapons. the potential ""oops"" of adjusting the guns is far higher than fixing the ships they are fit on and such adjustments could be rolled out ""over time"" instead of a gun adjustment to optimize how the ships use their weapons."

11/2/2010,"if you need more than one cycle to get a warpable hit, you're doing it wrong and deserve to fail."
11/2/2010,wait for the rage when he runs into the first unprobable t3 cruiser that just keeps running missions with him probing in local.
11/2/2010,paging angry german kid to the thread.also no.
11/2/2010,lmao great idea with the stealth probes though. maybe the prequisite skills can be all the astrometric skills at 5 or something
11/2/2010,"just a thought bout the physics ur talking about in here... although there are systems and ships that can cloak and still recieve information about items in the game that are on the same grid as itself.. probes are inherently not on the grid that whatever theyre scanning down lies.plus if you've not noticed how the scanning system works its much the same as a sonic ping but epicly hyped up! u cant have a cloaked thing send out a pulse of energy and still not be noticed.itll be like u dressing head to toe in black with a black mask and shades etc... and running round in the dark lighting up flares above ur head thinking no one saw you! theyll see u cause theres a massive flare above ur head!your absolute best bet in this endeavour are probes that can warp to location cloaked but scan uncloaked... and if ccp ever put out suuch a thing u can guarentee theyre gonna slap a decloak penalty onto it, whether its scan time duration or a delay before a scan can occur."
11/2/2010,cloakers don't need to be made any better than they already are. they honestly need a bit of a nerf due to how people use them to grief entire solar systems with impunity.
11/2/2010,"carebear: wahhhh, i got killed running a mission in low-secpirates: lololol adapt or die<carebear adapts>pirates: wahhhh, they adapted, give me new tools so they can't adapt again."
11/2/2010,i lol'd. nice tl;dr there.
11/2/2010,"agreed, let's start handing out ships and fits for free from now on.times have changed and mechanics should keep pace with it. ""grief engine"" seems to be an acceptable term for the current system."
11/2/2010,i support this. i am tired of free wardecs.
11/2/2010,"it is ""supposed"" to be a healthy even mixture of pve and pvp. i prefer this scenario. i also like it to be fair, not easier towards one side of the spectrum. right now with the prices, they are easier towards the agressor.well thankfully, not everyone can afford to throw away 200 million+ a week per wardec towards a war. i didn't say the mechanic fix was a perfect system, but at least with this fix it'll be somewhat more balanced towards both parties. this will also help to prevent afk trader-gank wardecs (i.e. where the agressor is in a 2 person corp and only comes online to see ya come into jita/dodixie/amarr to gank ya). like i said, 200 million is still nothing, but it amounts to something after a while."
11/2/2010,"agreed i can war dec 190 corperations a corperation war should cost you a bit more then it does, so a corp has to pay for it and not a person.edit: forgot the thumbs up thingy!"
11/2/2010,"not supported.highsec already is ""safe enough"".there is already a 48 hour delay till a war can start.. this is also to be considered a cost - which is pretty high in my opinion.if you want to increase the wardec fee, make it optional.. but for the agressor to pay for that option the war should start lots faster...i'd pay you 100m isk if i can dec a corp instantly (after 15 minutes or so) for that.. so how about that, huh?edit:btw.: a corp can only dec 3 targets at a time.. one could argue that after the many years eve is out there might be a change needed to that, too?! as there are so many corps around.. the limit should be raised.. so one could dec maybe 10 targets.. which i'd like as well... hehe..but well.. as you can only dec 3 targets the other targets you cannot dec at the same time are ""opportunity cost"".. so add these on your 2m dec-fee again plus the 48 hours delay (24h vote, 24h warmup) and you get a sense of the costs of a war for an agressor.so again: nt supported. defend your corp and its assets yourself and dont ask for a game-mechanics change to do that for you!"
11/2/2010,"the point of view of people supporting this is not ""pvp needs to stop nerf pvp nao!"". it's the fact that eve is based on making decisions, and it's not really any kind of decision to make when it costs you 2 million to start a war.war is srs bsns, it should be something that has to be weighed as an option, and right now there is no gravity in that decision. the wait-time before going active does not count as a cost, and is irrelevant in making the decision to go to war.better yet, i think it would be more fitting to have a ""bid"" system, whereas the aggressor corp pays for the initial war, and the target can pay the same amount to cancel it. all funds go straight to concord (isk sink right there).pvp takes many forms, not all of them are ship combat."
11/2/2010,"to nithi haya'jithe 24 hour period is a requirement (24s if your ceo says ""let's do it"".) to give the other corp a heads up to get ready. that part is the only benefit the dec'd corp is given. if you didn't have that, then people would wait in jita and start wardecing freighter pilots as they fly through. thus making the concept of high sec a 'semi-safe' place pointless. ya might as well turn high sec to null sec, and what a giant cluster-frack that would be. if you want to increase the amount of corps a corp can wardec, then by all means. this time around, i would suggest that concord would be allowed to display all corporations other corporations are at war with by using a bribe (2 mil + depending on the price) just to make things fair on both fronts. i don't see how you can't bribe concord to display that information, it must be cheaper than cow dung if you can ask concord to wardec another corporation for pennies in a jar. bid wars are also nice, but they can get wayyyy out hand. i rather just make a minor change in the code than to add a new module altogether.to the 'highsec is safe enough' thought... well i never said that high sec was safe, i will admit i do like the system of checks and balances placed by concord. the ability to blow something up before concord blows you up is a realistic flaw in any criminal system out there (although concord is sanctioned by the eula that you must dieeeeeeee if you do agress a non wt in highsec) and i am okay with that. all i am trying to say is that wardecs are too cheap. even 50 mil would be better than 2 mil. just fix the cheap rates."
11/2/2010,very nice . . . how much
11/2/2010,good idea.
11/2/2010,"i agree with removing local and the idea of unclaimed systems not having local seems fine, however why would an alliance want to pay so that both them and their enemies could see local. in reality, if the alliance has to pay for local, then they should be able to choose to allow local based on standings."
11/2/2010,"this is a good feature... although ccp would argue that a local chat feature is something that is inclusive in the gate system... any ship coming in and out is logged and communication between ships is done via the gates and their inbuilt systems. so naturally any system with a gate network would have a local chat channel. wh systems obviously do not have gates and therefore its not applicable that this feature would be available. ...although you could say that a system like local chat would be very inefficient to run in a practically dead system.ccp could throw it out fictionally as a subsection of a concord efficiency directive, stating: for star systems of less than 0.05 security rating a monthly subscription would be required to keep a star systems local chat channel and its underlying technical operating systems up and running. in order to process the subscrition for the said star system, evidence of sovereignty as a signifier to pay and use local would need to be met.;)"
11/2/2010,"if this was done, it would also make sense that npc controlled null sec would based off pirate standing. where only those with positive standings to the controlling pirate faction could see pilots in local.that said while i support the removal of local intel in null sec, i don't like the idea of giving any more advantages to sov holders, that have advantage enough with expansive numbers already. ccp needs to encourage players not to join the bloated napfests, this idea only encourages it further."
11/2/2010,or at least make a warp tunnel that is very hard to see through.
11/2/2010,"this. in order to implement this, it would put a very heavy burden on the system. i would support this thread, in 20 years when we have much much better computers. now, however, i just don't think it's worth it."
11/2/2010,"well once u have the basic static points in space and a radius of each one, how hard could it be to crunch some numbers to not fly through the mantle of a planet?if you thought im trying to make sure u dont fly through someones 5m wide drone or probe in some random part of space while ur flying faster than light, when u think about it, you wouldnt even notice it... its just the huge planetary bodies im talking about.theres a case to be made in high population systems for still flying through freighters, battleships etc... as number crunching everything (and i do mean everything) in a system would melt the ccp servers or your own computer obviously.but think about it... if a british made development studio consisting of 6 people could do it on a comparable, almost interchangable form of spaceflight simulation (with interstellar gate travel) comparable to eve's, in 2001!! to work on a 400mhz pentium 3 with 64mb's of ram... along with every other part of the game including full inertia non 'roll of dice' dynamic space fighting, in a full professional product, why cant ccp do it with theyre huuuuge hardware muscle, scores of development staff and us with our computers wayy in excess of the 400mhz p3 dinosaurs of the turn of the century?and if ur gonna whine about number crunching im sure a lot of peoples mobile phones could crunch the numbers for a few planetary bodies, their sizes and whether they intersect a straight line from a to b, in realtime without breaking sweat!"
11/2/2010,"stealth caldari t2 ship buff. (for those of you that didn't catch it caldari t2 ships have high thermal resistances)still, my fail trolling aside i think that this is a pretty valid idea. actually i remember when i was afraid to warp to the sun because i thought it would one hit my ship."
11/2/2010,"it would add a new layer of depth to the game, which would be extremely interesting to me.however, i'd rather not see the planets orbit, as that seems like it might a bit calculation intensive for all of the planets, moons, and all the systems, and i'm not sure how it would have much purpose.other than that, support."
11/2/2010,"+1and also gravity and atmosphere on planets/moons.now you can just fly to a planet and pump it, which is very wrong.well, what if a planets will have a gravity field? for example, when flying directly to a planet, velocity of ship increases witn decreasi"
11/2/2010,"this is interesting - kind of like localised wormhole effects.the only possible problem i can forsee would be fleets refusing to engage enemies in locations where they're at a disadvantage because of local conditions. there's already far too much waiting around for fleet fights, this could make that even worse.still supporting this because i'm sure it could be done well."
11/2/2010,"well one such though occured to me as well... thermal radiation is just a portion of the em spectrum so it makes sense that being so close to a star (pulsing or not) should incur slight em damage as well as thermal.. (although i think thermal should be the main player there)the other shining light to balancing the caldari perspective (soz for the pun) is that caldari sensors are gravametric... and warping to the largest mass in the system should play havok with grav sensors more than most... so in a sense u can hide bt cant fight.of course the right fitting on a ship could work bt it would weaken certain areas... eg putting additional sensor booster or secondary sensor clusters on caldari ships may remove the annoyance of constant natural ecm in the stars vicinity, but will use slots that would typically be used for defence/ecm/web/disruptors.im not saying caldari ships should be the only ones affected by a naturally occuring ecm field.. i just think the ecm strengths should be tailored to be grav heavy.and i do understand the problems with fleet fighting and getting engagements happening can be a problem. but after all... its an fc's job to be intelligent enough to see an oppertunity when its presented to him, whether its natural phenomena or covert intel.adding complexities allows situations to present themselves where intelegent fc'ing can gain an upper hand against brute force fc'ing.tbh i ideally want the players of eve to once again realise that space is deadly in itself, and that adding pulse lazers, autocannons, missiles and railguns to it are seen merely as multiplyers of the death and carnage thats already evident! :d"
11/2/2010,"i like the idea. when i first started playing eve, i was kinda disappointed that i could fly right next to a sun with no ill effects. there could be so much done with natural phenomena in space and not all of it has to be bad...certain gas nebulae should have a masking ability due to disrupting of sensors (yours and your enemies).larger bodies such as moons or even big asteroids could be used to slingshot a ship thus temporarily increasing non-warp speeds even without an afterburner.there should be places to hide in space especially where there is a lot of mass, i.e. inside a thick asteroid belt or tucked in close to and/or behind a moon, planet, or sun, especially if you have all systems turned off so that you don't have any type of signature. of course if you're close to a large body you then run the risk of decaying orbit and falling into the body due to the gravity field.and on the bad side...those same asteroid belts that you can hide in should also be difficult, if not deadly, to navigate through with the possibility of collisions that could cause damage or even destroy your ship.as with the hiding next to a large body, if you are working on your pi and sitting stationary, you should run the risk of getting pulled into the gravity field and atmosphere.during pi, the size of the planet you are working should have an effect on launching your goods into space - the larger the planet, the harder to attain orbit.star types would have varying effects on ships too - quasars, pulsars, red giants - all would have different effects on certain ship systems.i'm sure there are a plethora of other effects that could be found while roaming the expanses of space, both good and bad. having some of these in eve would definitely add to the flavor and immersion of the game if done right.+1 supported"
11/2/2010,"please, no. that's a bit much. i would like to be able to run eve on a reasonable aged computer.give it about 10 years, and then i would support the notion of gravity and atmospheres on planets and moons. otherwise, you're looking into making this game like crysis, where it's made for a computer that hasn't been made yet..."
11/2/2010,"i doubt eve will ever have collision damage tho i like the idea that small grav fields would affect ship speed.i think its safe to say that there shouldnt be any augmentation of direction due to grav effects though.. im pretty certain that a starships computer systems would use lateral thrusters to compensate. but increased speed/reduction of speed to and from objects with large mass seems logical.tell u what would be awesome... if u had an extremely small sig radius and hid in a dense asteroid belt should mask u... would be good to try and impliment some level of physical searching by eye of some places. tho that particular idea was inspired by some dialogue in the film serenity.i do believe that some of that does occur in wh space... been through pulsar systems that have a small shield hit when u jump into it. tho i do believe its no where near what should happen... the level of energy a pulsar releases on average would incinerate an entire planet like earth in close proximity, obviously with a lesser effect further away from it. plus gamma radiation streams from 2 poles of some stellar phenomena (black holes etc...) would incinerate anything in its path... but would be obvious to see... easy to manouver around but should insta-pop sum1s titan if they were feeling inherrently god-like and dumb."
11/2/2010,"...which is a myth perpetuated by hardware benchmarking sites. you can run crysis just fine if you have a 2 year old mid range graphics card, just not with aa.as much as i'd like to see realistic orbital mechanics implemented, it's just too big of a change. not only the actual implementation/simulation, but game mechanics. with proper orbital mechanics, you'd have a hard time even getting the orbit of two fleets to cross, let alone achieve a constant relative distance so they could fight. the concept of ship speed would also be greatly overhauled, as ships would need a minimum velocity (for a planet like earth, it's roughly 11km/s), otherwise they'd enter a decaying orbit; without external forces applied, a ship would also drift indefinitely; there wouldn't be a maximum speed (alright, only when you start approaching relativistic speeds), the turn radius of frigates coupled with their speed would create g-forces strong enough to make pulp of any crew and the ship itself, etc, etc."
11/2/2010,"i know the thought of a more physical stellar environment can get pretty damn deep... i wasnt thinking of going so far as to have realistic orbits, though i know showing info on planets in eve shows properties pertaining to such things.... thinking more rationally eve obviously doesnt have orbital bodies as bookmarks inside pos's would fail 99.99% of the time.im taking the idea of orbits right out of the proposal. (although im not sure i formally put it in) either way, there are other real world physical effects that can be replicated with ease in eve, without any kind of major overhaul in base code and complexity.i would love the idea of ccp getting creative with natural ecm effects on ships and the interplay of other cosmic signatures on sensors... both in a hostile environment and also in ways to provide more covert gameplay.one would be, 360 degree scans via d-scan picking up object behind massive planets and moons etc... this is a simple line of sight/intersection of lines and objects check. if a large body is between 2 objects when one is performing a d-scan i dont see why it should show up. signature shaddowing makes sense especially the way ccp has implemented the scanning in eve online.tbh this is shaping up to be not just a single idea but a group of ideas oin the same subject.. so if any1 wants to carry on brainstorming then at some point we'll all pull it into a big list and see whats the most popular of them all.. and have a go at trying to get ccp to implement say the top 5 or top 10!:)"
11/2/2010,"so if they make it so that that happens, i'll stop posting in reply to off-topic replies. until they do, i'll keep on havin mah fun...."
11/2/2010,"i wonder if i can support my own proposal?thanks for all the support so far. i will clarify something so that my stance is clear as there seems to be some confusion about exactly what i intend with this proposal.this proposal isn't meant to remove someone's ability to troll entirely - it is designed to reduce the amount of trolling done by individuals. the person above who mentions having 6 accounts is a good example of the problem. at the moment this person can post with 18 characters in a single thread - and probably does - which is just insane. something needs to be done about this. my idea is simple, elegant, and has can have no possible opposition apart from that of people who wish to protect their multiple character in-thread trolling.please, ccp. save our forums."
11/2/2010,"this is a repression of free speech, people who don't like the arguments of others always revert to censorship, not supported."
11/2/2010,"nothing wrong with arguing, it is to lessen the ammount of people who use alts to pretend to be someone else."
11/2/2010,"it won't change things a lot, but that's an easy change that will improves things a bit"
11/2/2010,i'm afraid that you are completely incorrect. this proposal would in no way limit someone's ability to freely express themselves. if someone has a stance on an issue they should not have an issue with expressing it universally.why would anybody post a contradictory argument to themselves or even the same argument with multiple characters in a thread unless it was for trolling or subversive purposes?there is no good reason not to support this proposal.
11/2/2010,"you are proposing great limits on peoples ability to express themselves, thats the very nature of your proposal. you surely accept, for instance, that one legitimate and effective way to undermine an argument is to 'subvert' it, derail it, or otherwise reduce to nonsense the 'seriousness' of that arguments supporters. if that is a chosen tactic of some, then i see no reason to impose a 'law' preventing it."
11/2/2010,anonymity. due to the same reason why we all have an avatar and a made up in game name to post on the forums.
11/2/2010,"only afterwards, u'd still have an avatar and an alias to post on the forums?"
11/2/2010,"they would still be perfectly able to express themselves. if they need to use accounts full of sockpuppets to undermine an argument they should not be participating.i cannot conceive of a reasonable situation where you would need to post anonymously in a thread with a character from an account which has a character you've already posted with.remember, this proposal is not about denying anyone anonymity or the ability to troll or alt post - it is about improving the quality of posting while reducing the quantity of posting."
11/2/2010,knee jerk much?christ it was an observation you tard.
11/2/2010,i was going to ignore your post but decided to address it in case you misunderstood my intentions. i apologize for my selfish and oafish behavior.
11/2/2010,"you missed what i did there.....anyway getting rid of alts post will not improve the quality. as an example, i post with my main, and it obviously has not improved your ""quality"" one bit, nor would you ever expect it to.so to get what you want, you will have to get the forum nzais (<-- you get who i am reffereing to) involved. and as much as most folk enjoy gustopo style enforcement of conformity....well you get the idea."
11/2/2010,"it's funny how threads like this seem to attract the trolls out, who want to keep their anonymity just so they can further screw with people, since the majority doesn't really agree with them."
11/2/2010,"oh, it's this proposal again...- there is low correlation between quality of posts and if poster is main or alt, rendering your proposal pointless.- what ah needs are better tools for rating/organizing/filtering proposals, this will enable ah to easily deal with both bad and good posts appropriately.personally i post with this alt (actually another main) because i'm mainly active in ah and don't want the proposals to be stigmatized just because i'm in alliance _whatever_, not because i do ****posts."
11/2/2010,"1. good posts don't need alts. bad posts do to project a better appearance.2. the mere fact that u acknowledge it's a stigma because of your proposal and on whose behalf u're pushing it through for means that it is good to force ppl to post with their main. 'cause then, we'd all know u're only trying to nerf others and buff yourselves...just like what u're doing now."
11/2/2010,"so letting the alts post does somehow improve the quality? i guess this notion is why many others do just that, huh? the only person crying ""facist"" is u. no one once said u can't post at all (besides the other ones against this that r making **** up from outta nowhere)--u just can't do it over several chars because u know your posts r so bad u need imaginary ""friends"" to support u. is any of this getting through to u?"
11/2/2010,"now now, no need to get your panties in a twist.the author of this thread stated he wanted to improve the quality. i simply stated what needed to be done to achieve that.now say your sorry....."
11/2/2010,"who's getting their panties in a twist? obviously, the one crying ""facist"". but thx for trying. yes, i know--your sorry."
11/2/2010,"oh right, i see what you did there....you sir are a master of **** posting."
11/2/2010,"actually your right to free speech stopped at the login button. it's a private computer system - ccp can (and do) censor what gets posted here at will (and on a regular basis).that said, what does your inability to post from two characters in the same thread have to do with your ability to say what you like? you can still use all of the letters on your keyboard regardless of which avatar you happen to attach to the post, right?right?!?"
11/2/2010,"took u that long to think of and respond with that much, huh? figures. actually, i had a valid argument, which u conveniently ignored and just continued to mudsling and blow out of proportion...over a forum change. we all know u don't want this because the **** posting u're demonstrating would look even more pathetic if u weren't doing it with your imaginary ""friends"" to appear that u're not alone. and we all know what type of post u're gonna go with next so in advance: btw, u do realize that in your effort to not use alts to try and ""debate"" this proposal, u're now gonna using your main in razor? of course u didn't but way to represent your alliance with your **** posting. it didn't stop u from doing so but we all know who it's really from, which is this proposal is really about. see what u did there? if not, plz continue making your alliance look stupid--i'd really love to see it."
11/2/2010,it baically insults their e-honor (the op and his henchmen) when confronted by a faceless alt that can not be linked to the actual main character they would never really confront in game anyway.
11/2/2010,"a lot of people are not understanding exactly what my intentions are with this proposal.i will simplify it as much as i possibly can:a) i have one account and three characters. there is a thread i would like to post in with the intention of offering my opinion.using my main character, i post my opinion in this thread and engage in a discussion, making several posts and replies.there is a thread i would like to post in with the intention of trolling. using my trolling alt, i post my troll in this thread and engage in trolling, making several troll posts and off-topic replies.b) i have three accounts and 9 characters...i am only put at a disadvantage by this proposal if... my characters are posting in the same thread.it's a tactic or practice used too excessively these days. these forums need this proposal to be enacted to reduce the quantity of self-serving and pointless troll posting and increase the quality of posting made by necessity.support this proposal."
11/2/2010,"you do not correctly understand the proposal. you also failed to observe the sarcasm i responded to you with previously.i do not have any issue at all with being confronted by faceless alts.i have a qualm with being confronted by several alts puppeted by the same individual, all with contradictory stances and opinions. it will always be present in eve and accept that, but with my proposal it would, by its nature, reduce the amount of posting of that nature by 67%.the trolls still get to troll. the posters still get to post. the only people disadvantaged by this are the people who need to have their errant behavior curtailed, it's gone on long enough.support this proposal!"
11/2/2010,i support.
11/2/2010,"so currently there is a mechanic, which alllows targets to be assigned a number (0-9), or a letter, (a-z), which will appear in a column you can place on your overview.the tactical uses of something like that are pretty helpful, if you sit and think about it for a bit.the problem with its current iteration is its slow and clunky to interface with. heavy right click menus with double drop down menus completely negate any chance to use something like this in large scale combat.butif we were to change this to a keybound inteface, it would allow for tactical target calling on a more dynamic level, and do away with another of the rough right click menus that are poopsocking an otherwise useful feature."
11/2/2010,"+1.and maybe more digits than 0-9 too, 0-99..."
11/2/2010,"heres your chance to prove that you did answer them. thats a post i put up earlier this thread. if you can answer that without resorting to ""you are a liar, you just want easy mode, stop trolling"" then i will be seriously impressed."
11/2/2010,"i realize this might not be as exciting as fixing certain ships, but here we go.recently, there sees to have been a rash of hijacked accounts in eve, and ccp's always been fairly paranoid about security, and with good reason. given the real world investments, both in terms of time and money, accounts have actual meaning. what i propose, then, is something similar to paypal's security key. in essence, a physical device/system that provides single use codes to you, to help make accounts more secure. thanks for your time."

11/2/2010,opposed. need more pubbies going testy for hilarity.
11/2/2010,i might support this topic if i new what you where talking about
11/2/2010,good proposal. the scanning interface as it stands right now is an eyestrain nightmare.alongside arrows that are viewable from all directions: colors that don't fade into the background from various angles. and shadows that don't blot out all the probe graphics if viewed from the wrong angle. and getting rid of the huge pile of mist or fog or something that covers the whole background of the probe display.
11/2/2010,"this would be cool for dust, give pod pilots something to do..."
11/2/2010,maybe a betting system for at?
11/2/2010,in my particular case it would be quite lucrative to also bet against a player in a pve enviorment.. maybe recoup for all my lost ships. =/
11/2/2010,"i am a lover of the high speed frigs that eve has to offer, the feeling of manual flying at top speed is so close to a flight sim that it keeps me in the eve universe for days at a time! the only draw back i find with them is that when it comes to firepower out of the 5km range they don't seem to be able to kill anything above a players destroyer when it has a decent tank on it, and most players above destroyers have wild tanks. there main strengths seem to be electronic support, stopping players from warping, pack hunts and low level missions. what i would like is a tech 3 frig that would have the ability to be able to kill cruisers (besides the stealth bomber) at a competitive range and being able to do it solo. it would bring a new level of fear to players in bc's instead of thinking of frigs as 'annoying' and just there to scramble, and fearsome in packs, or maybe have one as a capital ship that does just mean size, and that it would mean a lot to loose one, and take tons of time to reach it and a solo frig/intercept wouldn't be 'everywhere' so it wouldn't out weight the eve factor in a pirate way. the loki is closer to the solo fighter with high risk of loss, but it just doesn't 'feel' the same as a frig. and it would give us frig junkies something to aim for outside of the basic lock and hit style, lvl 2 missions and fleet combat. please support this vote as a yes, or maybe have an idea posted for something similar or fully argue against it."
11/2/2010,"frigs arent designed to go toe to toe with ships of such higher order of magnitudes in size. its like saying i want a new breed of chihuahua dog that can take down a lion. its not reasonable, not feasable and not within the realms of a mmorpg space and social simulator. i think you'd find that the only way a typically fitted sb would take down a cruiser solo would be in null sec or with an exceptional sb pilot and an extremely dumb cruiser carebare with nervs shot to hell and back.if you're hunting in a pack thats another story, but im sure there are frigs that have all the bonuses required to take down something larger.. you just have to prioritise certain tasks to certain types of frigs and fit them appropriately, as well as not fly them like armor buffered bs's.the amount of points, tracking disruptors, webbers, ecm's, neuts and vamps that u can get in a frig gang for a relatively little amount of isk is amazing when u really crunch the numbers.i just wouldnt go after any caldari passive tank if i were you."
11/2/2010,"i agree that there great for fleets, but i'm not trying to say that they should be mega strong or anything else similar, i'm not looking for a dread frig, just something better, even with full skills and faction/specialist ammo its dps is weak at any type of range outside of a scram range, most players i know love frigs but have to ditch them for more firepower, i don't think the defense or range on em should change one bit. its just in the eve food chain, you have frigs then destroyers and every other ship on eve above it, even good drones a stronger. i believe it should be able to compete with something other than the lowest 2 ship levels 'sololy'"
11/2/2010,"may be interesting to have a frig with bonuses to remote repping and bonuses to remote repair drones. a few of them piloted by some really good pilots would keep frigs alive against scout drones (a frig pilots worst nightmare), and have the maneuverability and speed to not be affected too much by being alpha'd, especially if theyre flown in groups of more than 2 so they can rep each other if they get heavily alpha'd.could be enhanced by a lower class frig version of an interdictor... slowing down backup from surrounding stargates."
11/2/2010,"i completely agree, it would add a nice complexity to eve as well, and in designing something new having some 'tweaks' could make it a tech 3 version, and is a highly interest topic that wouldn't be just about different fits for different types of tanks. an intercept shouldn't be a weaker drone, lol"
11/2/2010,"perhaps check this similar proposal...shameless self-promotion for idea feedback, not votes."
11/2/2010,"you'd only have to seed the teaching skill for so long, maybe a month or so, until people start to make it on their own. after that they wouldn't need to be seeded any more.pos fuel is much harder to make and mine, most items that can easily be made by players are cheap enough. the upper limit of how much player made skill books cost would be determined by the materials and time needed to make them."
11/2/2010,"and the number of people willing to train teaching to 5 just to make more teaching skill books, as well as the number of people willing to train esoteric skills like tactical shield management to level 5 to be able to produce the books for that skill so that i, as a new player (for example) can train it to level 1.i mean let's face it, how many active people in the game have gallente titan to level 5 so they can create more copies of the skill book? a handful? do you really believe they won't gouge the hell out of the market if there are only five or six people making it?if so, you should consider the possibility that you are not cynical enough to play this game."
11/2/2010,"also bear in mind u can get skillbooks for free by doing missions for certain npc corps and going to the lp store, so if the principle idea behind this was to not have to pay the high isk pricetag on some skillbooks by making them or getting a friend to make it, this idea is sort of redundant."
11/2/2010,also books are isk sinks that don't need removing..
11/2/2010,"why is the spaceship command skillbook even seeded when, afaik, you can't create a character which doesn't already have the skill trained to at least lvl 1?"
11/2/2010,"lol. i never noticed that before, but it is a good question."
11/2/2010,"nah it's just the team that worked on all that stuff think they are too cool for school.afterall they did an sql query that showed only 1% of players have over 300 ""contacts"".so it was ok to kick them in the balls. they forgot that 1% are the hub people, the content creators.so funny watching them try to push a social network website while breaking the very network of contacts people had already created."
11/2/2010,1
11/2/2010,"yeah, the whole zooming in thing doesn't even work anyway. lol i've tried it multiple times. my map always opens up on the east side of the galaxy, no matter where my ship currently is. this is really annoying, and doesn't seem like it should be that hard to fix. i have to zoom out in order to find myself and then zoom back in."
11/2/2010,/takes out pen and paper/ /are we in silent protest of something?/
11/2/2010,locked per request.
11/2/2010,marketing department and middle management.
11/2/2010,"propose moderation be brought up at the next meeting.this topic is in the right thread. after all, we are discussing an organisation. also; could any gm please elaborate on what is considered legal and illegal during downtime?"
11/2/2010,true. but they just make up rules. depending on what favors it
11/2/2010,i hear molle likes brown sauce..new rule: no ketchup at the bbq's.
11/2/2010,moved from corporation alliance and organization discussion.
11/2/2010,"i, too, would like to see a complete explanation on just how long before an extended downtime structures should be onlined."
11/2/2010,"also.. it would be nice to inform us about these rules before removing our tcu's. i mean, why waste all the time if it was known that it was illegal? problem is this rule didn't exists before this downtime."
11/2/2010,"yes, if ccp is going to decide that a certain amount of time must be spent onlining outside of downtime, they should give us a firm number to go by rather than making arbitrary decisions.what percentage of a structure's onlining timer must be spent outside of downtime?"
11/2/2010,"all ccp policy changes are announced via ingame decisions favoring it, i'm not sure what you're confused about."
11/3/2010,instead of giving a opinion of how it not should go figur a opinion how it does should chnage
11/3/2010,"cosmetic onlyi'm not really into it so ""no"" was my first reaction but, with incarna, they are aiming for it and won't be dissuaded.where i have a problem is this plex for remaps. isk for remaps - i have no problems with that but plex? that i have an issue with.if you look at the char count of 360,000 they aren't having financial woes when that exceeded their ""dreams"" of more subscriptions than iceland has population. this is flat out ""more money"" on their part. such isn't necessarily a bad thing but i'd prefer to see them get the money by getting more players in the game than by trying to bleed more funds out of the current subscription base.i don't like the ""first step"" towards a store being game mechanics bypassing. that's bad. wait until they have the pretty hair cuts or outfits, etc... then use cosmetics but right now eve has no cosmetics to ""sell"" and only 1 item that is bought - plex. so they should wait until they can get some ""pretty items"" to sell vs this bogus stunt.ps: if you really want to stop this, there is a way but it's not easy and i doubt it can be pulled off. you get multiple account owners to let all but 1 account lapse/cancel them while signing that they are doing so ""in protest"". 10k-30k accounts take a powder for even 1 month would get the message across in a fashion that gets the bean counters attention and posting that it's being done in protest... they don't quit, just drop back the number of accounts they are using. yeah, this would get ccp's attention a hell of a lot more than these threads will. such threads are just ""muttering"" and ""whining"". the above would be pocket book style attention grabbing and that's where they are looking -- their pocketbook."
11/3/2010,"yes.it's going to happen regardless of what you say though... that's just business as usual. ccp can do whatever they want to their product, they own it, you don't. the only statement you will be able to make would be to unsubscribe en masse... when you do please contract your stuff & isk to me for safe keeping.zug"
11/3/2010,no leave them for dust
11/3/2010,no
11/3/2010,nohell no!
11/3/2010,no
11/3/2010,yes please.
11/3/2010,"^^this. the nano nerf, the removal of 90% webs, and don't forget about the speed nerf. any one of these nerfs would have made blasters difficult (but not imposible) to use effectivly, all together they make blaster boats impractical, except for camping undocks. blasters and blaster boats need a total overhaul."
11/3/2010,"i think it would be interesting to see hull tanking be made viable on gallente ships. make it roughly equal to armor tanking, but without the speed drawbacks."
11/3/2010,"wouldn't it be more logical to reduce size of battleships? ship with 500,000 m3 volume shouldn't really be longer than 320-500 meters."
11/3/2010,yeah okay.
11/3/2010,bimonthly bump to keep this thread alive.
11/3/2010,"i support it, its a sound proposal. but the repair should take alot of time outside triage mode for carriers (somewhere around 10 minutes) and 5 for motherships. it'll get pretty annoying if it only had a 1 minute timer and 2 minute cooldown... (and i am not saying this cause my main can fly carriers soon... :))"
11/3/2010,eve did lose a lot of key players when they were forced into the previously optional premium graphics package.
11/3/2010,"not supported. id rather the devs fix actual game issues or add new features than waste time supporting archaic machines, especially when the overwhelming amount of users have put minimal effort in the last decade to upgrade beyond those specs."
11/3/2010,"because, as explained above and in the original announcement, that support isn't free. you can't just ""leave it in"". it costs non-trivial development resources to maintain.since at the moment, we're yelling loudly at ccp for not putting enough dev resources in to eve, it would be just a teeny bit inconsistent to ask them to spend those scarce resources on supporting a few people who wont upgrade to a technology standard that is only a few months younger than eve itself.sm3 cards came out in 2004. you can buy one for the price of a couple of large pizzas. as ed from hr correctly pointed out, you've had 7 years to get on this, and you've still got time left to do it.expecting people who play video games to have graphics hardware that supports a seven year old standard is not unreasonable."
11/3/2010,"it was so much nicer in here when you weren't posting...also, proof of that or htfu. the switch away from the classic graphics to the trinity engine caused headaches for (at most) macroers running 10 y/o systems for a low budget or people that ran secondary clients on their old boxes while their main was on a newer box.statistically, eve players come from countries where dsl is probably the slowest form of connection that people use. dedication to an eve subscription also indicates that the person would have to have a decent form of income generation. are people playing eve over a 56k connection? probably not...and if they are, they probably don't undock.asking ccp to keep the engine running with both shader 2.0 and 3.0 support is like asking me to keep coding in php3 when i already know the standards for php5. stop whining about it and upgrade your outdated hardware or play a game meant for what you've got (like minesweeper...)"
11/3/2010,"supported, a 3 year-old (3.5 by the time shader 3.0 is required) laptop should be able to run eve on low settings.at the very least,have a console command to force the disabling of shader 3.0. maybe i won't see the bumpmaps on incarna or the other new effects will have inverted colors, but so what?"
11/3/2010,"yes, the omen sucks. it'd be nice to see it fixed."
11/3/2010,confirming that the omen is terrible and that atm you can get kind of an okay fit with fmp and that it fits really well with qlb but those suck anywayplease fix the omen; at the moment there are zero good cheap laser cruisers and that sucks since lasers are awesome
11/3/2010,"the omen is in desperate need of some extra pg, supported."
11/3/2010,another proposal thread popped up for this issue here...
11/3/2010,adding support
11/3/2010,"well. props to aiden here. i constantly use this tactic. mostly for its pure wtf factor. carebears will always be present. they will always want easy ways to do things others actually work to find a way to counter. of course they just want aggro rights. obviously, the original tear fountain comes from someone that fell victim to this tactic. now really, don't you think ccp knows about it? it's working as intended. it is not unfair. if you want the same thing, train an orca alt, get in a shuttle when i start shooting you, and fly the hell away. it's not that hard.complaining about it because you don't wanna find a reasonable way to counter it is what 90% of eve will do. and for the csm rep that gloated about it.. really? because you obviously have the sway to get it fixed right nao, amirite?we (general rule-bound griefers) enjoy it when someone stands up and points fingers at us. we found a mechanic we can make use of, you ***** about it, we lol. life goes on."
11/3/2010,i'm nearing my own legion myself and support this fully.
11/3/2010,^ this
11/3/2010,blizzard can help you with these problems.
11/3/2010,"as someone who spent their first 6 months of eve in wormhole space, let me say this:probing is easy as fsck already. htfu.seriously, are pirates this lazy these days? holy crap..."
11/3/2010,you fail at scanning. and the csm will not help you.
11/3/2010,"i support topicstarter's idea.it doesn't really matter for me how new players enjoy or don't enjoy to start eve. and what they want: smart strategy and tactic game or counter-strike with space ships. if ccp removes learning skills, safes my skill training speed and returns sp to me i would be happy to invest those sps into new skills i want right now. i haven't anything against learning skills and i spent time after calculation. never was angry or pity about this ""lost"" time. because it is element of strategy. like any other skill (does anybody like to spend 10+ days to get +2% bonus to something??? i don't). but if ccp makes us gift (some amount of free sp) i agree with it. because i like gifts."
11/3/2010,"hello there person with no life outside of eve. this is supposed to be a game. dont take it seriously and whats with ""if people cant handle it eve is not for them."" cmon man this is a game not some private thing only pros should play. its like ""i suffered **** you should suffer too."" man your selfish. whats with the nobody forces you to train learning skills 5/5. why in the world would a person invest 15/month on a character that is sub par. its more of a soft power(not **** related) politics thing. the right choice is so obvioius its not even a choice to begin with.this is for improving the game widening its fanbase/supporters and giving ccp a fatter wallet so you can play the game you want with quality updates. last thing how the hell did this become a microtransaction we dont pay money to take away learning skills my god! your so passionate about plex for remaps you see it everywhere. i support this because the learning curve is really steep as it is and i dont want to add more to that burden by forcing new people to wait it out to actually play the game. personally eve is lightyears away from *** as a game but *** is more welcoming to the new players because the game actually allows then to do something in the game the first few days. the time where new people are all hyped up and excited. dont want to mention names and im not recruiting for ***"
11/3/2010,"yes but why stop there.maybe incorporate sec status into the dec cost. higher sec status more it is to be war deccedwar decing shouldnt be free or any cheaper ( this is at the yarrtard and morons saying this is a pvp game)just fact this is a sandbox, highsec? a faucet? i would like to see some number on income, but scaled to populationi'm sure highsec makes more, but then again 80% of players are strictly highseci hope they increase the price, because again, they need new isk sinks and wardeccing is a prime way to do this. 200mil is nothing to a lot of players, let alone an alliance"
11/3/2010,"the mechanic isn't perfect, agreed.but i'd much rather see people running around in rifters with their underwear on their head, drooling like puppies after a tasty treat, wardecing each other left and right than people not decing like crazy due to cost constraints."
11/3/2010,"i see comments here about eve needing to be a balance between pvp and pve. however, in my view the game is heavily skewed towards pve already, and getting worse not better. even null sec is mostly pvp optional to pveers due to local mechanics etc. unless you count ""market pvp"" and scams, pve is the major or only real source of isk for most players. i suppose ninja salvaging/looting could be considered a pvp source of isk, but then most people wanting to make wardecs harder also want to nerf the salvagers/looters as well.at a minimum i think the p alliance wardec nerf should be reversed.but ideally i would like to see pvp and game lore put before pve for once in eve. have players and player corps tied to the in game empires and factions and then have war automatically between players of rival empires/factions."
11/3/2010,"supported... for less frivolous wardecks by small corps, and a very much needed isk sink for the game with an unhealthy infinite isk inflation."
11/3/2010,"from a lore standpoint, capsuleers are the lucky few who have paid the price for what essentially equates to immortality, and are considered neutral agents. as for having players and corps tied in with empire factions and warring, we already have that, it's called faction warfare. perhaps you should check it out.if i wanted to have a strong identity based upon my race, i'd go play wow. a large chunk of eve's appeal is the sandbox nature of interaction between players. if you want to yell about how amarr are horrible racist slavers, go join your militia and get on with it, but there's a segment of the playerbase who couldn't care less what happens in empire aside from if it means a different system is a primary trade hub, but probably hate a group of other players that they may live next door to.to me, eve is balanced between pvp and pve. i go shoot rats to make isk to pay for spaceships i can afford to lose while shooting at the guys next door (who are real players and probably hate me just as much). while i'd love to have billions of isk to throw around, it wouldn't really mean much other than that i have to spend less time doing pve things. pvp in eve is a lot like real combat happens, from my understanding of real combat/war. sixty minutes of waiting for sixty seconds (or less) of action. and before that sixty minutes of waiting for an enemy to shoot at, there was the five hours i spent ratting up the money to buy those modules/ships/skillbooks involved in the eventual shooting.i'm supporting this on the fact that it's a decent isk sink to increase wardec prices. it's doubtful that serious wardec corps/alliances will feel any real pain from it. the best solution would be to scale prices based on the size of the corp/alliance declaring war and the corp/alliance that is getting dec'd. your two man corp wants to attack a 5000 man alliance? you're going to have to pay for it."
11/3/2010,wars themselves would do a much better job of that than fees used to prevent small or poor corps from declaring war.
11/3/2010,"if capsuleers were considered neutral agents we wouldn't have any standings to empires and factions in eve. we do have standings therefore capsuleers are not neutral, they pick their sides based upon their actions. what's missing from eve is real consequences for those actions and resulting standings.yes i'm familiar with faction war is eve, and to me it's rather lame, despite being a gamer that played in a number of sandbox mmos as an rp/pvp type player... exactly the sort of gamer fw was meant to attract, i have zero interest in participating in it's current form.pve free from pvp, to then go pvp with the gains made in pve. that's pretty much the exact formula for thempark mmos dynamics between pvp and pve. this is what you want, and your talking to me about sandbox mmorpgs? everyone's entitled to an opinion, but the justification for those opinions here for a wardec nerf are quite frankly pretty weak or nonsensical. it would be much stronger if you were just straight up and say you want a game where you pve free from pvp and leave it at that."
11/3/2010,"four people can run level ivs in drakes for a few hours and easily get 100 million (probably faster if they use cnrs/golems/nightmares correctly fitted). if a corp can't afford a 100 million towards a wardec, i doubt they need to be in a war(otherwise the miner corps will just stomp all over them in bigger ships...unless they are idiots).most corporations i have been at war with fly tech 2 expendable ships. i mean, if pvp high sec wardecs are a way to help create isk sinks/keep markets going.... an increase in wardec costs is not going to be that much of a dent in their wallet. they are probably just going to spend wiser on who they wardec, not just wardec people because a corp has a stupid name or they were looking at them funny. i really do believe that the amount of deaths in high sec are not going to change due to the increase in cost, but i do believe pointless wardecs will be avoided.like i said before, wardec prices are not relative to their cost from then to now. there needs to be a 'market adjustment' fix."
11/3/2010,not supported ... mechanic isn't perfect but is far from brokenwe spend 2.75 billion a week every week we run 10 wars ...being in a corp/alliance is a privilege .. not a given .. if you don't like wars .. stay in npc corps -or- get better wing-mates
11/3/2010,read the thread and this is basically the tldr:penalize a corp / alliance that pvp's in a pvp game because the defending corp is not motivated enough to defend nor aware they are playing a peeveepee game.i think this pretty much sums what they are asking for.
11/3/2010,supported for the destruction of those god damned rr domi's.
11/3/2010,"that can be easily twisted to ""don't be in so many wars at once"" and ""you have the option of wardecing or not"" and ""raise your taxes""."
11/3/2010,^^ this
11/3/2010,not really ... i'm not the one in the 'sand box' crying cuz i'm getting sand kicked in my face wardecs had been nerfed years ago .. look up the 'p-nerf'next you'll be asking for ccp to have a dev hold your hand while you play the game
11/3/2010,"p-nerf...very cheap considering the fact that an alliance is made up of a series of corporations and those corporations are responsible for those funds. if you have 10 corporations in an alliance and are at war with 10 other corps/alliances then its 50 mil per group a week (plus whatever the cost is for continuing the wardec). if you have 3 corporations in your alliance and are having this issue, try consolidating the alliance into a corporation. nine times out of ten, its an alliance wardecing a smaller alliance or corporation when you consider the grief engine mechanic. no sand is being kicked in my face. this is more targeted towards corporation on corporation wardecs. besides, i also noted that it can be an additional 25-50 mil per wardec addition (not another 200 mil). to be honest though, you should really not be in that many wars if its costing you that much isk or at least make them mutual. i am not against a corporation's ideal if they want to shower themselves in wardecs with as many corps as they want. just against the cheapness of it all.but if a dev wants to give me a dutch rudder while i play the game, i really can't complain. :)"
11/3/2010,"technically you do warp around objects, just in a polymathatical n-dimensional way."
11/3/2010,"what? exactly how would it be a ""heavy burden"" and on what system? this doesn't need to be a server-side effect at all. just have the client pick some random arc that doesn't intersect with any planetary bodies.(i never understood why missiles have to fly in a straight line as well; they could arc on your screen in whatever way, regardless of where they really are according to the server.)(edit for support)"
11/3/2010,"alright, so i love the idea completely. but that one guy's right about creating lag, so if they add it as a feature you can take off if you want for performance reason, it would definately be ****ing awesome.supported anyway for great idea."
11/3/2010,"no burden needs to be put on the server whatsoever. since there is no way to interrupt warp anyway? and warp only get a player from a to b, server does not need to know that player is going around a planet. on the server the ship will go in a straight line, and the client will display it going around. as long as ship arrives to point b at the same time as it does on the server, there should be no problem and no extra load."
11/3/2010,"it wouldn't really matter. people who really wanted to troll would just log to another account. god knows, half the people i know in-game have 3 or more."
11/3/2010,"supported. this is my alt. you can post with an alt, but not in the same thread. it makes perfect sense.edit - you know what, they're right, people are just gona use a different account anyway. i guess just live with it."
11/3/2010,"the point of this proposal still remains--placing restrictions on alt posting. it's not gonna eliminate it completely but 1 alt per extra account is much better than 2 alts in the main account plus 3 per extra account. so if the trolls wanted to restore the number of alts they could've previously used, they'd have to pay triple the total subscription for it. hell, u can even tie it to the credit card number that everyone has to submit upon creating an account. and if the occasional troll, for some reason, still feels the need to troll a forum badly enough to pay that much, then it's their money, which goes to ccp as an incentive for other improvements."
11/3/2010,exactly why this game isn't even half as popular as people on these forums make it out to be
11/3/2010,"no.isk for remaps i can see but plex? no. there is a difference between them though you obviously are too blind to see it.this is flat out buying a way around game mechanics with cash. your cash or someone else's. with isk more could be done with respect to how it operates -- rep at stations, etc... could effect the prices but with plex... that's cash & carry.as for the effect of remaps, i sure as hell know more about this than you do. i misunderstood what ""2 free remaps"" meant at the start so had to remove a remap across my first year of play. i saw over 2 million sp come out of my first years training plan so this isn't ""trivial"". this *is* buying sp with cash just the same as the ""logic"" of buying isk with cash via plex comes into play.so isk for remaps? i'd support that. how someone got the isk is their business but plex? that i don't support. try interacting in the game vs just tossing $$ at it to advance faster and buying gtc to immediately swap for remaps isn't ""interacting"" with anyone beyond ccp."
11/3/2010,"i support this, as this will bring up plex prices and therefore get me more money when i put real $$$ into a game."
11/3/2010,drowning in a sea of terrible ideas.
11/3/2010,"great idea, i have made previous suggestions as to using hotkeys for target tags. not only for being able to set a tag on a target, but being able to target the tagged target as well. example, target caller assigns tags like, 1 to the primary, 2 to the secondary, 3 to the tertiary e to the ewar primaryf to the ewar secondaryremote rep boats could assign r to the repair target, s to the shield rep cargett to the cap transfer targethotkeys allowing the targeting of a given tag could allow the fleet to coordinate targeting more effectively with less overview issues."
11/3/2010,"of course, either you simply lack all comprehension or your claim that i should 'prove' that i've already answered what i've obviously answered is a troll.with you, it's hard to tell.anyways, i'll do a quick rundown just to point out that all your nonsense has already been dealt with. already pointed out that you simply have no idea how the game works, how large-scale alliances deploy to forward operation zones and your whole whine about ""zomg, nine whole jumps!"" is just whining. jump bridges played absolutely no substantial role in allowing pretty much every single large scale invasion in eve, and obviously as successful invasions have gone on, your whines about how stagnant they make eve are nonsense, too.already dealt with as this is just more of your ""nine jumps make me impotent at eve! nine jumps!!!!"" coupled with your whining about how it's almost impossible to incap pos mods, reinforce pos's, destroy those pos's and take sov coupled with your whine about how alliances could just station titans at pos's and set up jump portal chains anyway.to say nothing of the fact that there's no actual way to deal with this as any alliance with a pair of brain cells to rub together will just give a few systems in their constellations to other blue alliances to set up their own jb networks. what you don't know about logic could fill a book. i'm not even sure what sort of response you think this deserves. i'd ask which specific logic fallacy you're claiming this is, but, come on, we both know you're just babbling. again, you wouldn't know logic if it bit you on the face (not that your assurances aren't worth the electrons they're written with... though they're not). also, you are again trying to pretend that you are the emperor of fun and you get to define for other people what they find fun. your absurd game that you're really using other people's definitions and they just don't know when they're having fun, but you can tell them, is simply more of your trolling. aka ""nine jumps""!!!""just more ignorance of basic facts of eve. as if regions like delve, fountain, tenal, etc... haven't been seen as valuable even before the advent of jb's despite their distance from empire and as if there isn't already value to being close to empire. also coupled with your ""zomg, who could ever reinforce a pos????"" no rebuttal necessary. an admission of your own that you can't even support your own point, but you like it so you're going to advocate it. yet more ""mommy ccp give me easy mode!"" nonsense. there is no reason that the average individual should be able to significantly influence the dynamics of interactions between tens of thousands of people. as noted, that bit of trolling doesn't fly. when you know full well that you're trolling, pointing out as some sort of victory ahead of time that someone will probably point out you're trolling... is hardly a logical point. it's like vomiting on someone and then complaining that, why, they're about to claim that you puked on them."
11/3/2010,so your argument is that this is incorrect:and you have provided no further justification other than i dont know how this game works. well isnt it funny that a ccp dev has said the above? and that this:
11/3/2010,"supported.jump bridges make managing vast tracts of space far too easy, and cost is not an issue when you have a monstrous number of players farming those vast tracts of space for resources and isk. they also give a ridiculous advantage to defenders in sov warfare, as it makes 'divide and conquer' moot when the defender's fleet can literally be everywhere at once.i dont have a problem with jbs in theory. my problem arises when the mechanic is abused by entities such as the nc to make moving freighters full of poses, supplies whatever, completely risk free. they bring it in through a high sec entrance that they have camped and then its a hassle free 5 or 6 jump trip to cross multiple regions. theres something wrong with that picture. the idea behind freighters is that they can move huge amounts of stuff, but they are vulnerable to attack without an escort. jump bridges make logistic chains invulnerable. nothing in eve should be risk free, least of all managing sov and alliances"
11/3/2010,"gee, what are the odds, shown that you're lying and trolling (again) you've decided to try to change the subject (again). greyscale was talking about jump drives or titan bridging/black ops bridging. not jump bridges. he, at least, understand the very basic facts about deploying and how alliances actually do it. you still think that jump bridges are the key and that nine jumps(!!!) will ruin your entire eve game. greyscale did go on to state that, probably (in his view) jb's ""contribute"" to ""big wars"" but of course he never went on to describe how, and as already pointed out via your impotent whining, entire coalitions can deploy in force to assault their enemies without any reliance on jb's, at all. nor is pointing to a rather poorly thought out musing of one dev somehow proof of anything (and is, in fact, fallacious). you might as well point to zulu's carrier proposal as proof of... something. the idea that groups won't assault other groups if they have to move a few more jumps to get to a staging area is powerfully ignorant. the idea that ccp should somehow try to break up people's natural tendency to work together (in an mmo of all places, for shame!) and to force them to have ""small wars"" is also an idea that is jabberwockian in its absurdity. but if all you've got is the appeal to authority fallacy (and yah, that's all you've got) i guess that you'll clutch at any straws that come to you. just like the best way to break up ""blobs"" was to create a class of ship that could fire aoe doomsday blasts through a cyno. and then the best way to boost small-gang warfare and help small alliances was to create the current system with sov structures that take hundreds of people and days of sustained combat to convincingly threaten. to say nothing of the basic point (that you keep ignoring) that greyscale's mistaken view is not due to him trying to game the system so ccp can save him and give him easy mode, like you're doing. an essential distinction that you keep deliberately avoiding. moderated for trolling. zymurgist"
11/3/2010,"not to interupt your rant about my reading comprehension.ps. i am not at all against nerfing titan bridges and cyno jumps either, i think ive said so in this thread also. i just think we should start at a pretty logical place ""instantaneos travel should have limits such as alliance only use.""if you think this wont promote more importance on the alliance in which you reside and less on your coalition therefore hopefully leading to smaller and more frequent battles... then i mean sure you can say that. but it would have to be for a reason other than my poor english/stupidity/trolling/easymode lust.also you look at one aspect of jumpbridges being ""offencive"" but they are far more useful in things like defencive actions where entire coalitions of forces can be funneled into system using jbs/titan avoiding many of the risks / traps another force may have set for them.it also regardless of what you say makes living further away from empire easier and more viable for the day to day member, by doing so may promote less competition for regions closer to hubs/empire. but i guess this logic doesnt count if i knew how to play the game... your coalition is firm and strong and built on friendship and trust and honour!!!!! not on greed... so enforcing that regions like tribute/vale may be easier to live out of than branch/drone regions would never cause problems for coalitions... hopefully leading to what i now term as ""funmode"" eve.now im not saying this is the only way of adding value to regions, but it is a way relevant to the discussion of jumpbridges."

11/3/2010,"do you know whats the same about these three quotes? other than you said them all...well... its that they arnt the same as this... so i wonder, are you a liar or just not able to follow your own arguments? you know just give yourself that same rant you just gave me about simple english.if you are actually interested in having a discussion now you must answer is greyscales position on jumpbridges (similar to mine) accurate? or is it not? and why?and this is all i have been waiting for you to argue."
11/3/2010,"you cant do it can you?heres the line your argument needs to start at:""jumpbridges do not promote increasingly larger coalitions/larger fights/more boring stuff""edit: btw autism is an extremely serious condition and i would hope you are not trying to use it to mock someone on a forum that is intended to be constructive and for discussion about how to improve the game.funny that you would tell me that stuff belongs on caod should i have said it."
11/3/2010,"in this whole thread you have not said ""jumpbridges do not promote increasingly larger coalitions/larger fights/more boring stuff""you need to say that because i believe the opposite. and you have spent a long time saying that i am wrong."
11/3/2010,"i agree.i woouldn't say remove them completely, but i think the alliance only use is a good idea.i would also like to add on a side note that has nothing to do with jbs but could make small gang stuff more fun and act as an incentive to travel/roam more.> i mentioned it a while back but i really think ihubs should be attackable while the sov is still in effect, even if it is just to neutralise them so that they only run at 25% efficiency etc [requiring reps to be bought back up to 100%]. this should be do-able with a 15 man gang or so and i think it will really help provoke a fight rather than roaming 1234567 jumps only for the carebears and locals to dock up and look from their windows.anyways, i support this idea, gj mini."
11/3/2010,"ive asked you politely to not joke around about autism, so im just going to put it out there that i have reported you for this now.but let me get back to your post, you do realise it would be far easier to just point out where you made this argument rather than post over and over again that we are liars and trolls.as ive said it makes no sense that you ""arnt going to jump through more hoops"" when you continue posting at such length about things of no consequence to the argument at hand."
11/3/2010,thread cleaned of trolling and off-topic posts. please remember to post in a constructive manner.
11/3/2010,"lets discuss the problems with this.option one: i am a troll (which lets hope for your sake you dont believe, we will look into this in a second.option two: i am not a trollshould option two be correct you have not provided a sufficent counter argument to ""jbs enforce a trend towards a game style that is inherantly unplayable"" now lets look at the more worrying of the two. should i be trolling and you seem insistant that i am, whether to discredit an argument you have no other way of doing or because you actually believe it to be true, i point out that should i have been trolling you, (which i have not been) you have clearly become emotional about what is being said. you have started quoting me as ""troll who is an idiot"" or things to that effect which im not sure you can claim has been done because of your unwillingness to be trolled. if i was a goon... i would ask you ""u mad?"" i cant see anyone using phrases such as ""i know you are just pretending to have autism"" can claim they are how do i say it... ""not mad bro""?so please, stop with this straw man and just answer the questions.1. do you want to have fun in this game?2. is unplayable gameplay fun for you?3. do jbs lend to this style of gameplay?4. how can we start to change this?if your answer to any of the first three questions is no... then we really have had nothing to discuss this whole time.the reason i brought this here was to discuss the fourth issue."
11/3/2010,"i suppose that i could point out that this makes actual logic curl up into a ball and cry itself to sleep. but i'll content myself with taking your fallacy as an acceptable material conditional and point out that i have, numerous times, specifically and at great length, described the many reasons why each and every single one of your claims about jb's and their detrimental effect is wrong. and since the thread has been cleaned, people can find those posts that much more easily now. so, by your own logic, option 2 must be rejected.qed."
11/3/2010,removed discussion regarding moderation. if you have an issue with the actions of a moderator submit a petition.
11/3/2010,"the closest thing i see to an argument from you in those remaining posts is you downplaying the importance of jumpbridges in moving numbers around. (and you have not addressed that there is a strong implication that titan bridges should be looked into also)which is completely ridiculous. im not sure how you can stand here and say ""jumpbridges play no part in making it easier to move numbers around""the next closest thing to an argument is that ""having more people in fights is fun"" ok im not exactly sure why that is the case? maybe thats just your thing you want to feel part of something important or something which im not saying is bad, but i think the majority of people would much appreciate more instances of battles and more playable engagements. and changes to jumpbridges/titan bridges (i would go as far as saying jump freighters and other cyno type things but thats for another thread) which make it harder and more riskey to move around in relative safety/quickly would end up giving more people more fights and more of them being playable.am i wrong?"
11/3/2010,"as this is another wildly obvious fiction, i feel that it should be pointed out. you advance the fiction that those aren't the ""same"" thing and since you're for some reason unable to follow the argument, that i must be. to remind you, greyscale said that ""probably"" jb's ""contribute"" to ""big wars"". your argument, on the other hand (to remind you, in case you've forgotten) was, via direct quote: ""now days anyone set blue to a coalition can jumpbridge over half of eve in a few jumps. this allows for massive numbers to stagnate 0.0 being able to control pretty much whatever they like.""not contribute, and not contribute only to ""big wars"", but that 0.0 has stagnated and big groups can ""control pretty much whatever they like."" that is wildly divergent than greyscale's views and, as pointed out numerous times with copious examples, simply wrong and ignorant of basic eve mechanics. just wanted (yet another) object lesson as to why your demands to see things that have already been posted (and in some cases, which you have already responded to) but you claim don't exist is a waste of time. 1. that's dishonest, i've pointed out that they are functionally irrelevant to long range deployment to forward-hq's in invasion zones. 2. and, of course, as you've just been claiming i didn't advance any arguments you've now admitted that you were lying. eviscerating your whole ""nine. jumps!"" argument where you tried to argue for how those dreadful nine jumps were somehow the driving factor in the nc being able to invade lxq was, indeed, an argument against the only concrete example you've even attempted to provide of the deleterious effects of jb's which you claim exist. likewise, this is a lie. because that too is a lie and i never said that. it's not hard to understand how you're ""not sure"" i could say something when you made it up and pretended i said it in the first place. likewise you're lying and making that up and pretending i said it. this is why people should not believe your claims that arguments which have been made do not exist or take your claims at face value when you claim that things have been said."
11/3/2010,"ok after briefly going over all 3 pages ( current) worth of posts im gaining that you want jump bridges hit with the nerf bat or remove completly. my question to you is why jump bridges alown cost a huge amount of isk to put in place both in the jump bridge and its constant fuel needs and in the pos that is required to support the bridge. they are currently limited to 2 per system so its not like its a insta jump to target system. currently eve mechanics are if your red your dead if your blue i like you. i see no reasion why my buddy in the maelstrom cant follow me through my own jump bridge.if your in a 0.0 alliance you can under stand that you have multipal frounts that you can be attacked from at the same time. there is nothing worse that getting eve-mails saying ever pos in system x is being destroyed and your 45 jumps away having to use every singal gate to get there. jump bridges are not invulnerable, get a fleet of 45 or so people and blast them half way into structurebut leave them up , doing this means that the corp cant put down another bridge to fill the gap as there at there limit and they cant tear down the current one cause its damaged hence they will have to get a big logi fleet to repair it for about half a day."
11/3/2010,"i dont think we can have an argument if you think rhetoric such as ""you bastards friggin blue whoever you want and can be wherever you want in a couple of jumps"" nullifies ""jump systems make it easier to move around with larger numbers.""i think this has been the biggest problem between us and why you insist on calling me a liar. its because my use of rhetoric is interpreted by you as hard and fast fact.simile, metaphor, euphemism, hyperbole. i still cant believe you are arguing that my argument is ""you can save 9 jumps via jump bridges its unfair"" my only explanation for this is either willful ignorance or misunderstanding of rhetoric. you can always take up my offer of a chat on voice coms if you want me to make clear to you free of the problems you seem to be having with my posting."
11/3/2010,"iirc, vuk said this and was ignored. his own argument is that,in the current nc invasion of the drone regions, pilots coming from mm space may, potentially, have been saved a whole nine jumps and therefore jb's are game breaking and the game is stagnant and blah blah blah. he's ignored the fact that the defenders have jb's and major battles for sov have been going on for some time now there. (examples of how the game isn't stagnant even when jb's are in full effect in other conflicts have been ignored too). the fact that they don't offer an instajump to a target system isn't relevant because the argument he's advancing doesn't need no facts to get in the way. he hasn't advanced any reason that's remained unrefuted, either. he's voiced a lot of anger at the nc but has had absolutely no answer for and has in fact deliberately ignored the fact that even if blues can't use each other's titans/bridges, then all that has to happen if that alliances let each other's titans park at staging pos's and bridge their own alliance members and/or alliances just trade individual systems in their constellations so other alliances can route their jb's through if they're not allowed to use other blues' bridges. his argument is that he knows, better than you, what you want out of eve and what you find to be fun. if that argument fails, he's argued that bridges make 0.0 space stagnant (as well as the exact opposite, that it lets large groups take whatever space they want)despite the fact that defenders can, have and will continue to lose even when they have a full jb network in place. this was pointed out to him too. he argued that it was virtually impossible (for him) to incap mods, reinforce towers, etc... i believe he also blamed triage carriers at one point.edit: oh, i see there are more lies. okay. of course, that is a lie and you're making it up. what really happened is that i pointed out that your entire argument actually boiled down to one single, solitary concrete example (as the only one you could provide) and that it was that the nc had roughly, 9 saved minutes on a trip from h-w to lxq and you were arguing for why those whole 9 minutes were an insurmountable advantage (while you were ignorant of how major alliances actually deploy to forward staging areas). because you keep lying. unable to deal with what's actually been said, you invent something else and pretend i said it. that is your argument, and your denial is laughable. that was the single, solitary example you provided of how unfair the nc was. and to do it you had to ignore that the drone regions have their own jb's. and that the conflict invalidates all your nonsense about ""stagnant"" nullsec. of course you want to claim that your argument is mere rhetoric and sadly 'misundstood'."
11/3/2010,"thanks for responding in a decent manner.let me go through some of the things you are talking about.firstly jumpbridges are not costly at all, this is only an illusion. as vuk lau has stated in this thread mm (which i believe to have the most used jumpbridge network anywhere in eve atm) is paying 10-15b a month in fuel. now lets ignore for a second that this is actually cheap for an alliance to run, a few moons would do it, lets look instead at how it is being used.the mm bridges are ones i like to camp sometimes, so ive seen first hand some ridiculous stuff going on. one issue is the majority of the traffic on jumpbridges such as mms does not come from mm directly. it comes from assorted nc entitys, secondly people often ignore alliance rules such as ""dont jump carriers/jumpfreighters through the jbs"" and some alliances dont have those rules. this further bumps up the cost, thirdly it is a frequent occurence of gangs and fcs that are too lazy to fly somewhere manually to jb 40-50 ships to get where they are going slightly faster.now all of this i think is misuse of jbs, i honestly think jbs would cost next to nothing if people who had the time wernt just being lazy and other peple wernt jumping carriers through jbs to save themselves on fuel costs...now two jbs per system is imo too many... but i havnt really discussed this yet. the reason i think this might be a little strange is because a well set up network will allow people to get where they are going (assuming its somewhere theres lots of travel/hub of some sort. without ever needing to use a regular stargate bar entry system.) call me oldschool but i think stargate travel is really meant to be the inescapable traveling system of eve its how we were raised ;p.now the point you made about letting your friend follow you through etc etc, it isnt so much about you being wrong about that. its got a lot of things to do with the culture of eve and the model underwhich the game should be played (at least imo). in eve we used to blue people we actually liked so that we could fly with them. as time progressed we started to blue people we didnt really have any feelings towards so that we wouldnt be attacked by them. more time passes and we start to blue people we dislike and start to try to force ourselves to like them so that we collectively are unconquerable. so from that perspective i disagree with it. but a far more pragmatic answer would be - it detracts the need/desire to build up your own alliance.there should be a strong insentive to build oneself up and not to simply rely on bridges/space you dont/cant control. i am unsure of the wisdom of a model that is not reliant on you being able to do anything whatsoever.the point you make about the 45 jumps thing and you having to fly all the way to save it manually is one of the big reasons i would like to see jbs removed... not just looked into. this would encourage players to hold space they actually need and not overarch. atm we have giant slabs of sov space that are completely uninhabbited. and i think this is largely because its so hard for a non-coalition force to break in and start using unused space. and this is because it is relatively easy for a coalition to just move far away from where they are staged and grab what they want rather than what they practically need.now this is a bit of a greedy cycle, the more you get the more you can have, and theres no real reason to stop...your last point is a bit on the naieve side, a 45 man gang can reinforce a jb but its unlikely that it will remain reinforced for long. triage carriers can rep them up extremely quickly and even should they not, its a very difficult buisness to reinforce a jb at a hostile deathstar likely stacked with ecm mods. couple this with the fact that youll probably get jumped on by even/bigger numbers its just not really worth the risk/effort to go reinforce for eg. the ncs entire jb network."
11/3/2010,my previous post was in relation to the guy above the guy whos calling me a liar.btw seeing as i only had the one example... here ive just made you another one:
11/3/2010,"called it. most people who want to deal with jb's attack them. mini is, yet again, arguing for his inability to accomplish pos warfare (complete with complaints about triage carriers ignoring the fact that they're delicious targets). this is the problem with easy mode advocates. the rest of us accept the game works the way it works and if we want to incap enemy mods or take down their towers, we attack them. others argue for why ccp has to make it so that they don't have to attack them. because it's ""a very difficult business"" to attack a deathstar pos, the answer isn't to adapt and if you can't handle pos warfare, to go do something else in eve... it's to get easy mode. no, it's your lack of understanding of economics. spending that isk on jb's has an opportunity cost. you are deliberately ignoring that and acting as if enough isk to buy 12 motherships a year can be handwaved away. it's the same sort of fundamental lack of knowledge that informs the broken window fallacy. subjective opinion backed up by... nothing. also (much) less than honest as you're a 2006 character. jump drives were already in place in 2006. so you have a subjective opinion backed up by nothing and supported with something untrue that you made up. unsupported, nonsensical claim backed up by... nothing. and, of course, debunked by actual facts as dozens of major alliances have spent considerable time building themselves up even with the dastardly jump bridge menace in effect. see above claims that mini was really saying the same thing as greyscale despite mini wanting jb's completely removed from the game and greyscale suggesting slightly modified factors like jump range. standard ""people who can't adapt or compete need eve on easy mode and ccp has to save them"" coupled with general ignorance of the game. as if, deciding to take enemy space, the (nine! jumps!) a coalition might save matters and they can't simply throw their forces into attacking a region even if it's half way across the map. evidently those nine minutes are drastically important and 4 filled fleets won't be able to threaten sov if it takes them nine whole additional minutes to get to their target. welcome to eve, surprisingly enough an mmo with player-created content in an area specifically set up so that players can take and hold turf. but some people need ccp to give them easy mode so that they can compete in ways that they wouldn't be able to accomplish without ccp's direct influence."
11/3/2010,"heres the thing that gets me about your entire line of argument. your counter to jbs is exactly why im saying they need to be looked into...because the fact that you need(no two ways around it) to have vastly larger numbers than the people you are attacking and over a longer period of time to do any significant damage to their jb network, the advantage swings more and more readily into the court of the people with larger numbers.all this encourages is coalitions to not stop growing and to hold more and more space so they can reach further and take more things they dont need. - all of this promoting fewer, larger/unmanagable, and more boring styles of play. (my major point in this thread)and the next time you claim 15b a month is expencive because you can have however many motherships by the end of the year, ask yourself where all the isk from the ncs moongoo has been going for years. you know before you had to pay this arduous tax for using jbs... and back when moongoo was worth a friggin boat load (4b a week some moons). if you believe for a second that there isnt massive ammounts of embezzeling going on and that there hasnt been for years... actually... that would make sense given your arguments thus far."
11/3/2010,"mega-fail on understanding what an example is and what's it's supposed to do. ""zomg, fewer jumps!"" is an example for nothing. it's just you wasting electrons. nobody has denied that jb's shorten the total number of jumps. but you know that. so you're arguing against something that nobody has said, anywhere. just like you've conveniently forgotten that your original argument wasn't just that there were a whole ~gasp!~ nine jumps shaved off a route, but that it was a hugely significant situation that led to nullsec stagnation (in the face of one of the most massive conflicts that eve has ever seen, complete with significant shifts in territory) and such nonsense. now of course you're trying to change the subject by showing that, gee, some routes with jb's take fewer jumps than without. shocka! unsurprisingly you've really just spent however many minutes trolling through an app to find any route you could that was shorter than any other route without jb's, all without bothering to show the least little effect that we've actually seen in game from that that so awfully disrupts the ability of groups to fight each other. what's ridiculous is that you still think you're making some sort of point with this nonsense. ""look, fewer jumps!"" is an argument for nothing other than that there are fewer jumps and that you can't attack pos's and you need ccp's help and so on and so forth.edit: more ignorance of basic mechanics. fiction. my counter is that it's perfectly possible to raise a fleet and go do something about them other than complaining that ccp needs to alter the game itself to help you. yours is that you cannot possibly attack them and so ccp needs to help you. simple ignorance of eve game mechanics. smaller groups can, and have, dealt with larger groups and pos warfare in specific is notoriously open to timezone warfare. again, argue for your own inability to accomplish anything and, go figure, it's yours. back to the emperor of fun speaking, ex cathedra, about what people should want and what they'll really find to be fun. coupled with a total lack of understanding about basic eve mechanics and the fact that 0.0 space is supposed to be carved up by player-driven content and if a group of people manage to use valid game mechanics to take more of it than others, then the response is to fight them and not demand that ccp give you easy mode so you don't have to fight them. fallacy of non sequitor, broken window fallacy, and deliberately ignoring the fact that isk spent has an opportunity cost. so add in ignorance of basic economics. and anti-nc trolling that has nothing to do with anything, at all. go figure."
11/3/2010,"hohohoho, misterfinn, you're going to be mister finnagain!you are typing so much... but saying nothing of value..."
11/3/2010,"one of minigin's original points was to restrict bridge usage to the alliance that owns them. i say come it from a different direction:move the jump bridge from a pos module to that of a stand-alone structure anchored at a planet. give it some resists/hp increases due to it losing it's tower defenses but keep the restrictions of 2 per system, sovereignty, etc but make three changes. 1) members of the owning alliance, when using the bridge, have the fuel cost deducted from the fuel stored in the bridge. 2) any allies must carry their own fuel which is deducted from their cargohold. (this next change could go one of two ways, so i'm putting both here) 3a)hostiles/neutrals can, through the use of analyzer and hacking modules 'trick' the bridge into thinking they are blues and use the bridge or, 3b) the bridge is totally jumper-neutral and anybody can use it if they have fuel in their cargohold. changing the bridge like this puts into place a catch-22 situation. yes, it gives a bit easier movement to the owner and their allies but also opens up the opportunity for hostiles/neutral to exploit it. i liken it to a real world invasion..just because someone invades your country doesn't mean they can't drive on your roads."
11/3/2010,bridges are a little more sophisticated than roads. i think the idea of hacking them is indeed interesting though.
11/3/2010,"not supported. if you don't like enemy jump bridges, all you have to do is get a few super carriers out there and blow them up. it happens all the time. you can also put some bombers near the bridge and watch as the incoming fleet is demolished by your bombs.. oh wait you suck so bad you cant do that either lol..not only that but they aren't as easy to move thousands of ships as you say. lower the fuel capacity? what are you smoking.. bridges need to be constantly fueled or they run out already. if you moved 1000 ships through one it would run out and a good chunk of the fleet will be left on the other side.if people want to move large fleets around they can without a bridge anyway.. there is that thing called a .. *cough* cyno..fuel costs money, sov costs money and time.. bridges are working as intended.i actually wish that bridges could be fueled by blues, so that when it runs out of fuel, you can add fuel to it to jump, rather than wait for one of the owning corp members to have to come out to fuel it."
11/3/2010,"good luck. several people have tried to explain to mini why actually playing the game to counter jb's is the way to go and not asking ccp to save him from game mechanics, but he keeps talking about how he can't deal with pos's. i believe that the reasons are ""death stars"", ""people might defend them!"" and ""triage carriers!!!""maybe i missed a reason why unlike everybody else who plays the game, there is a certain group of people who need ccp to save them and can't fight over territory and resources but need ccp to remove them instead. ah well."
11/3/2010,"yeah, i know a few players, including myself, that have had the one week timer expire on them about the time they start or complete part 9. part 10 gives a major boost to both faction and corporation standings. i did a petition on it when it first happened to me quite a while ago. after about a week a senior gm reset part 10 for me. during that week i found the patch note information and added it to the petition. this was before the timer was actually active on multi-part storyline missions. it's just a shame that the so called 1 month expiration timer is only good for part 1. i'm sure there are probably other players who have missed out on completing that mission series."
11/3/2010,"it could provide a much needed extra layer of security to your eve account, but if said hacker has installed something on your computer and has remote access to your computer what's to stop them from getting this information as well? a keylogger that included a time stamp or whatever else is used in the generation of these numbers, plus said numbers, caught you logging in 3 times... would be enough to crack it... example wow security solution the authenticator was bypassed in this manor, it uses the time and the number on the back to generate the 6 digit number.all being said i support more security even if it is breakable."

11/3/2010,"i don't believe pgp would work in this case, since we're talking about passphrase systems, not the encrypting of files.as for cost; if ccp where to go the phone route, the cost would be little to none, and if they went the physical route, it's unlikely it'd cost more then 5 dollars."
11/3/2010,"if you wanted to point to existing solutions, you could have gone for otp with printed out lists instead of hardware tokens. pgp is sadly not the same.(edit: fix typo)"
11/3/2010,"printed out lists would be horrible. we are in the 21st century ffs.if you want proven and reliable solutions you want something like paypals security key (that i never heard about before, i immediatly wanted to add to my paypal since i hate the lack of security at paypal, and promptly told me it wasnt available atm), every serious bank uses something similar for online banking security.also honestly, this is the 20th proposal we had about this."
11/3/2010,you could go with rsa securid but those things are 60 dollars a crack...
11/3/2010,sure it would be horrible but it would be kinda cost effective for ccp and get the problem solved ;p
11/3/2010,already a discussion for this with lots of supports and further information here....

11/3/2010,"ccp has asked the csm to provide suggestions on what they would like to see in incarna and what functionalities would be desirable.so what would you like to see in incarna.1) gambling(poker + others)2) trade of illegal boosters3) corp lounge/bar (customizable and additional functions for meetings.)eg) map room that all can see with improved maps drinks strippers rooms for private meetings option to not save chat logs when in a room recruitment bots who provide a longer write up on the corp. trading with out any fees, a station bazaar type deal with store fronts4) way to harass war targets, maybe blocking there ability to trade until the deal with yousomething to end station games.others?"
11/3/2010,"i think a lot of people have been wishing that a viewport into their hangars or some random hangar from inside the station would be cool.a sparring minigame would be cool... just gonna throw it out there. kinda like tekken bt without bull**** super abilities. and the ability to place bets on who wins. im not saying promoting violence all over the station but behind closed doors, and only 1 v 1 but possibly with the chance that prolonged dualing can damage implants and even clone death. would make a change from ship pvp toou can even remove the button bashing by having the fight consisting of charges, bare with me here... in the same way that scissor paper rock has an ability to win loose or draw, u can have a fight that consists of a set of moves, say 5 in each... where u either attack, defend or block. and you can only block a max of 4 out of the 5 times for example.attacking causes the most damage but leaves you more vunerable to counter attack on the same move, defending allows a radomiser to score an attack hit lower than a full out attack.. but also allows a randomixer to reduce damage from an attack from the opponent. and a block blocks any attack and doesnt allow any attack hit on your opponent.u can add a set of skills to improve the randomising agents in the minigame tooso u choose a string of 5 attack, defend or block choices within a time limit, and when both players have, the sparring encounter occurs. then these rounds carry on till either 1 player gives up.. is knocked out or gets dealt a deadly blow.u can even add various types of matches, clean matches with no additional items and no drug use and vice versa!((edited to support)"

11/3/2010,i would like to see more than a handful of these 168 mostly pretty good and already csm-approved suggestions implemented.why bother posting more ideas when they can't implement more than the most trivial ones? w
11/3/2010,"i'd like an option to access a kind of vr booth which allows me to experiment with various ship classes and fittings (for free, or a small charge) against purely ai enemies. this would be especially useful if it allowed you to try out ships which you can't fly for real due to skillpoint or budget limitations.this should be strictly single player, just so that people don't end up logging into real eve just to play vr eve.various card games like poker and blackjack would be nice, but i think a lot of nations have rules and regulations about gambling online, and it could be argued that gambling with isk is equivalent to gambling with real money. i'd love to be proven wrong on this one, because meeting up in station for some poker would be ace.it's been mentioned before, but some kind of strategic map which can be annotated and updated by the viewer, who then sends info out to fleets in the field, would be really interesting. there would have to be some unique functionality to this map, or it's no better than the fc having dotlan open in a second screen. one feature i can imagine would be to introduce a new sov structure which automaticaly tracks the number of pilots in local, along with their standings, and then presents that info on the strategic map. in this way a player watching the map could get great intel from multiple systems and inform the fleet as to the situation in friendly or contested space.scouts would still be needed, however, as enemy space would not be covered by this system, and even in friendly space the map could only tell you the number and standings of pilots in systems, but not what they're flying - necessitating direct observation by a scout if you want detailed info."

11/3/2010,note to self raise this
11/3/2010,there is no issue...
11/3/2010,"if your going to try and shoot something down saying that its so bad it doesnt need an explanation only works 5% of the time, like trying to figure out why some guy fitted a titan with mining lasers and such.that said im generaly on anti logi duty when it comes to fights as silly me i trained caldari bs5 and have no real turret skills, so im generayl flying my scorp.the main strenght of a logi blob is there ability to lock each other as they take incoming damage and rep faster than the damage there taking, if i can knock out 5 logis even for 20 seconds thats generayl enough time to actualy kill one , simply rince and repeat.that said the main problem in eve is not that there are to many logis , its that there are to few other roles in fleets. currently there are 3 fleet parts, command ships, main fleet, logis. command ships generaly take a very long time to get good at and every one can be part of the main fleet, hence the only other avalable part is logis"
11/3/2010,"tl;dr: after 54 replies and 700+ reads, only the original poster thinks this is a good idea.meanwhile, almost everyone agrees that logis warp speed should be upped to match most normal fleetships, it was approved by the csm, submitted to ccp, involves changing one value in the database, and ccp has done jack **** about it.is it just me or does posting ideas in here seem increasingly pointless?"
11/3/2010,"im sure if everyone had their own mint, and was able to print however much money they wanted, they would also (at least in the short run) think its fine.its only after you start having to spend a million dollars on a loaf of bread that you realise what you have done to yourselves."
11/3/2010,hold on so where are those eccm projectors coming from?
11/3/2010,"yet again, faced with someone who (yet again) is trying to remove his ignorance and point out effective ways to counter logis, mini is arguing for his own impotence. it's almost like no matter what, mini is going to aruge for reasons why he simply can't accomplish anything and why ccp has to save him and put his game on easy mode. oh, wait, i mean it's exactly like that. it's a decent tactic (in certain gang types) for standard ships to fit a remote eccm or two and to have logi partners that they can pair up with. of course, as i keep pointing out, mini is a liar and a troll and nothing he says can be taken at face value. a basi with one local eccm and two remotes on it has a sensor strength of 153, not 269. but of course his ""all level v"" should actually read ""all level v - modified"" because he's got a full set of high grade talon implants in there, for, iirc, about half a billion isk. i guess mini just accidentally forgot to mention that."
11/3/2010,"if i wanted eve on easy mode... should i not ""make friends"" and join a coalition such as the nc?we talk as if its something hard/worth doing, how you are playing the game. like i should aspire to be as good as you...if i was in it for the fun, should i not look at things which arnt fun in this game and say... ""is this fun/not fun... why/why not... how can it be made more fun?instead of everytime there is a suggestion of change i choke in my own furrious splutters of ""that guy just wants easymode eve he wants mommy ccp to come save him"". lets face it, youve spent the better part of the last few days claiming i cant adapt to what eve is like, yet ive been there done it all, and suggested that it might be in everyones best interests if it not remain so. if anything all you are proving by blind ranting is that you would be unable to adapt to changes such as logistics blobs becoming marginally important and jumbridge systems being slightly less effective. and i think the reason why is because it took you so long to figure out how to use these things to begin with. you dont want to learn how to do anything else. its really quite sad.your sense makes no."
11/3/2010,"caught in the fact that you were lying and trolling with that picture and its half billion in implants that you just happened to forget to mention and edited the info to hide, you are (again) trying to change the subject. and you're attempting to change it by:-trolling the nc.-trolling the nc again.-again pretending that you are the emperor of fun and nobody can decide for themselves how to play the game but since you need mommy ccp to protect you and set your game on easy mode, that you're really doing that so you can benefit other people (whether they want it or not).-the same trolling tactic you keep using where you troll, and then post about how someone is going to call you out for trolling, and then claim victory since you're obviously trolling but someone pointed it out so you win valuable points redeemable for fantastic prizes.-then trolling that since you're unable to adapt and you constantly argue for your own impotence and talk about how you need mommy ccp to save you and give you easy mode, that really it's the people who can adapt and play the game who are the ones who want easy mode. it's your traditional troll on this subject: people who play the game and adapt are the ones playing on easy mode, those who need mommy ccp to save them (like you) are hardcore. -then of course more trolling (probably anti-nc trolling) about people ""learning to use things"". as if it takes time to learn to use jb's or, more likely, your often repeated lie/troll that razor didn't use armor hac gangs about a year to a year and a half before pl did. but, of course, this is again just your trolling attempt to change the subject from the fact that you're arguing for how impotent you are and for why you so badly need ccp to save you, so you'd rather troll the nc and act as if you made a point. because if you're impotent and need ccp to save you, then the people who are actually willing to adapt to the game must be unwilling to learn to do anything else. not like you, who are not only unable and unwilling to learn to do anything, but you need mommy ccp to save you and set your game on easy mode (which is really hard-****ing-core)"
11/3/2010,"considering how cheap and useful those sets are i would be surprised to see a logi pilot without one, unless he is going for a different strategy.with all the macro ratting in the north, you would think you could afford a few implants to make your hull tanked ravens rat more efficiently :pbff"
11/3/2010,"i heard in eve you arnt allowed to use implants... fyi 500m to be unjammable is relatively cheep, especially if you play no risk style.dont pretend for a second you didnt run straight off to eft to see how i was doing that just as i expected you to. and just as i expected you to you ran back sceaming how i was ""caught out"" by you... the point of that link was to show how ineffective ""ewar"" can be against logis. 150 strenght isnt exactly weaksauce... so i am perfectly sound to have said ""yah ok if you know how to play this game you know why jams wont work against anyone running a proper logi gang""instead i get idiots saying things like ""i fly a scorpion... i can jam 5 logis""then you whiteknighting them saying ""its ok you are easily jammable(completely ridiculous) if you dont use implants!""edit: and exactly like the guy above me just said... if you arnt using implants you should be..."
11/3/2010,"mmm hmmmmm. this from the same person who thinks that jb's are ""risk free"" for freighters jumping through them. oddly enough, you also somehow missed the fact that those implants were on mini's ship fitting although he deliberately tried to hide that fact.but of course you also included some trolling-the-nc in your post. if there's anything that helps support an argument, it's some trolling. ayup.p.s. learn to play eve, mini. jamming is percentage based and there's no such thing as unjamable. but typical trolling from you. caught in your (pathetic) little bit of deception, you're trying to change the subject. oh, and if you're lying and trolling, admitting that you're doing it is even dumber than the awful trolling you love to engage in. just like you rather obviously have no clue how to play the game if you think a pack of scorpions can't absolutely ruin a logi chain even when two remote eccm's running on each logi. to say nothing of your hillarious ignorant babble about how any pilot who ever flies a logi ship should invest half a billion isk in each and every jump clone that might get into a logi. and, of course, as you really like lying you've fabricated yet another quote and pretended that anybody ever said it, anywhere, let alone in the service of ""whiteknighting"". you're not very smart, are you?"
11/3/2010,"surprise, mini is again trying to argue for why he's unable to do things in eve and why ccp needs to save him. meanwhile those of us who actually fly logis (with or without spending .5 bil per jump clone) know that even an enemy that puts a lot of ec-600's on a logi wing can count on enough jams to make things significantly tricky for them, to say nothing of a dozen scorps too."
11/3/2010,"no im not saying i have trouble dealing with logis... im saying you do... and im saying its going to make the game boring.you just said ""a scorpion wing can mess with logis easy"" but i just showed you why thats not the case... so you changed your argument to ""ecm drones!"". ill let you figure out why ecm drones dont work well on your own. rather than me having to friggin babysit you all through very simple tactics we have been using for years.btw even assuming you cant figure out the exctremely simple solution for ecm drones you should know they are actually bugged. ill let you run off to the test server to try figure out how."
11/3/2010,which ships do the eccm projectors get fitted too? i havent seen this tactic used and i cant imagine it being particularly viable in an ahax gang (i could be wrong there)
11/3/2010,"what ships cant you fit them to? the hardest gang to run them in is a shield gang because you need the mids to tank and tackle also, but even there we have extremely strong setups that involve a lot of projected ecm.and this is what worrys me about this game, im being shouted down by people who are using the setups incorrectly or at half their potential. just wait till people figure out how bad they have been up until now."
11/3/2010,"they're quite effective in ahax gangs (ignore mini's trolling about how other people fit ships, he likes lying about that). in a standard gang you want to have at least two or three zealots (ideally) that each have one remote eccm on a guardian buddy who they have watchlisted. it helps boost sensor strength but, of course, as it's percentage based drones, scorps, etc... all can pose problems to a logi chain, especially when coupled with secondary effects like neuts, damps, painters, etc...were you lying then, or are you lying now?as for your troll that you haven't been whining about how you can't deal with logis but really it's other people (who've spent many posts trying to tell you how you can deal with logis) who can't deal with logis... okay. i guess it's that kind of tard logic that you keep using to troll.no, you didn't. you understand less about math than you do about logic. and that's saying something. also, you're (yet again) lying in order to troll. that's (yet another) thing that nobody ever said, anywhere, that you're making up. go figure. you're lying about that too, and of course you're still sucking at math.your general ignorance about eve and total lack of knowledge about how to play is, again, hilarious as well. yep, liars have to have very good memories because evidently you can't even keep track of your lies. which is it, there are very simple tactics that you've been using for years, so there's absolutely no reason for you to be whining about how mommy ccp needs to save you and give you easy mode? or your original claim that it's almost impossible to counter logis so mommy ccp needs to save you and give you easy mode? see, this is why not lying is much better than lying. try it out, you might even like debating honestly."
11/3/2010,"you can also use more against logis than ecm, with damps it takes longer to lock the target which might be just enough to kill him before reps kick in.also it is pretty funny you choose the basi for your ecm chance calculation, quickly followed by the remark that it might not be too viable in shield based gangs. where exactly were you planning to use the basi? or has it something to do with basi having highest sensor strength? (too lazy to actually check, but since it is caldari it is a reasonable guess).anyway logistics make fights longer. longer fights are more enjoyable, spending 30 minutes before seeing the opponents, hoping you actually get a fight while most times one side just wont engage, and then the fight being over in 10 seconds because you got primaried first is no fun. shooting on each other for a long time is way more fun."
11/3/2010,no. purely because you posted in green. no idea what your idea was.
11/3/2010,"yep, just like his 'forgetting to mention' and then later 'hah hah really i was trolling you' bit about putting in .5 bil worth of implants."
11/3/2010,"ah never heard of them being used like that, interesting idea."
11/3/2010,"no i chose the bassy because thats the one i have used most(and had the fit ready for on eft). and i said it was ""less viable"" the bassy is still amazing and you can run friggin insane gangs with them.you can still get a guardian to 230-250 sensor strength with relative ease. the difference between the two is really negligable. - and in day to day use it is more practical to have the guards with higher strength than bassys (simply because of my already stated argument that in armor gangs you use your mids for a lot less).also i dont see why you cant use implants... i just said ""even assuming you are all bad at the game and dont use the implants... you still get remarkably high strength""yes one of my counters involves sensor damps but its not nearly as effective as you might think. there are much better counters, the problem is you wont see them very often for various reasons.besides lets face it... if you had the choice of flying somewhere with 50 logistics of 50 scorpions supporting you... what would you rather (assuming of course you would fight even or greater numbers).im just warning you that once people get their acts together and you start seeing 100 vs 100 heavy logi gangs, this game is going to get pretty boring. and that people are having one of the very good counters (eg. missile volley) removed so they can cycle their reps in time... (rather than broadcasting when things start redboxing) leeds me to to believe that you guys dont actually want counters for logis to exist... you like them the way they are because you dont die as much as you used to...thus i can see when someone stands up and says ""yo this is gonna get friggin ridiculous and boring soon"" you all want to continue printing money in the short run... because hey... youve figured out how(or so you think)."
11/3/2010,all im saying at this point is that a stacking penalty should be looked into...theres stacking penalties for practically everything else...
11/3/2010,"caught lying and saying both that it's virtually impossible for him to deal with logis, and it's trivially easy for him to deal with logis, and really he has no problem dealing with logis but the folks who have problems dealing with them are all the people who've been trying to tell him how he could deal with logis while he's been saying he can't do it... mini tries to change the subject and keep trolling. unexpected. and novel! you draw conclusions like a spastic five year old on pixy sticks draws starry night with an etch-a-sketch. the fit that you had ready with no mods other than an eccm and the edited ""all v's - modified"" that you tried to sneak in as a normal one and which you already admitted was part of your plan to try trolling people?yah... good call there. you're even going to lie about what you, yourself, have and haven't said. amazing. of course, again, you're the one who uses your claims that you're horrible at eve to claim that you need mommy ccp to save you and give you easy mode. also, loltroll, anybody who can't spend .5 bil per jump clone is bad at eve now. zo noez!!!also, as the emperor of fun, you can tell people when they are and are not having fun, even if they (annoyingly) think they know better. peasants."
11/3/2010,"so far you have said the following:.5b is a lot.rzr didnt steal the idea of armor hacs off anyonescorpions can mess with logisticsecm drones can mess with logisticsyour limited understanding of this game is only eclipsed by your limited understanding of how to argue a point. you actually need to have one, you cant just say ""my counter argument is that you are a liar and a troll"".now a perfectly valid argument for you to have used (which you didnt) is something like ""after a certain number you can just get enough dps on the field where no matter how many logis there are you can volley down people."" now im sure this is true and a good argument, however i would rather not see the effective counter to a mechanic be ""bring so many that there is no chance they can rep in time"" because again that promotes a type of play which imo shouldnt be promoted.its funny because now im actually arguing your side for you =s as well as presenting my case.feel free to continue calling me a liar and ignoring valid points at your leasure."
11/3/2010,"by the way, have you figured out yet if you were lying and trolling when you claimed that it was almost impossible to counter enemy logis, or lying and trolling when you claimed that it was trivially easy to counter enemy logis and you'd been doing it for years? just curious which story you're going to try to stick to. thank you for reminding me that you are a committed and relentless liar. going to retract your lie yet about how rzr didn't use armor hac gangs roughly a year to a year and a half before pl, led and organized by rzr fc ernest grafenberg?or do you just like lying? value is relative, genius. and i'll point out that you're lying, again, as your demand was that anybody flying a logi should have .5 bil worth of implants in that clone, which means every single jump clone that might see use in a logi. both are true. you not having a clue how to play the game doesn't invalidate, ya know, facts. or math. or logic. fancy that. of course, you're lying (and trolling) by claiming that i've ever done that. go figure. every actual argument you've advanced has been dealt with. every, single, one. of course, i've also noted that you are both a liar and a troll, as proven by your own posts (including your own admission in this thread that you were trolling). liars needs to have good memories, yours sucks.trolls need to make sure that they haven't already trolled the same point that they're now claiming is a good one. failtroll. being that you're not presenting your case since you evidently can't decide how you're going to troll (you still can't figure out if you're going with the story that it's nearly impossible or trivially easy for you to counter logis), you're also certainly not arguing anybody else's side.the **** you just pulled, actually, is known is the strawman fallacy. pretty textbook, actually, in that you set up an argument that nobody was using and then knocked it down for (bogus) rhetorical effect. but i guess when you're a troll who's pretending to have some sort of cognitive damage, that goes with the territory. again the same trolling tactic of yours. you lie and claim that i have ignored a single valid point and then preemptively whine about how you'll be caught at lying. just like you lie constantly and then preemptively whine that someone might point that fact out. speaking of which, figured out yet whether or not it's trivially easy or virtually impossible for you to counter enemy logis? just want to be clear as to which claim you're (now) saying was a lie and which you're (now) saying is what you really meant to say."

11/3/2010,reading all 3 pages of this proposal was a waste of 15 mins of my time... and i want those minutes back minigun.i think ive figured out wtf is going on in this thread...i think sum1s a little ragey that they were pulled from the fc list. bt the again if i was joining a fleet and told i could either snipe or be logi... id probably have grounds to complain bout the level of intelligent command.-1 on the request tho... ahh if only!

11/3/2010,"you seem to have forgotten to answer this. please do. describe what your real position is and identify which one you don't believe. is it that logis are almost impossible to counter or logis are trivially easy to counter and you've been doing so for years? yes it was, it had a full set of high grade faction implants. and as you already stated, you included that with the hope of provoking me into a response. which you don't have open on the image you used. to say nothing of how you admitted that you were using the image to troll for a reaction and are, again, trying to change the subject. this time to a totally different screenshot. you could try addressing and trying to rebut them, rather than repeatedly pretending that they don't exist. i've at least directly addressed and eviscerated each and every single one of your points, but you still can't and won't even admit that my arguments exist let alone honestly discuss them."
11/3/2010,"i think bad logi gangs are very easy to counter. i think good logi gangs with good fcs are also counterable, but the counters to them are pretty hard to pull off and often rely on their fc not suspecting you of doing something fishy.i wasnt ignoring you because i didnt have an answer, i was ignoring you because you have no idea what you are talking about.again i need to point out that i dont think you seem to understand very much of my rhetoric. you might be misinterpretting it for trolling. in fact... i think thats definatly what you are doing."
11/3/2010,"nope, sorry, i want you to clarify not try to evade. were you lying when you said or were you lying when you said:both can not be true and so one is, obviously, a lie. which is it? it's nearly impossible for you to counter a gang that isn't making serious mistakes, or you simply do not have trouble dealing with logis. only one can be true, and one must be a lie. which? mmm hmmm. two quotes, one is obviously a lie, both are your words, you've ignored them for about half a dozen times and now you're trying to obfuscate and claiming that it's really only about ""bad gangs"" when you said both that you have no trouble dealing with only bad gangs but the rest are almost impossible to counter and that you have no trouble dealing with any logis at all. mmmmm hmmmm. i recognize that you're saying things, regardless of whether or not they're actually true, and using them to prop up an argument that is unsupportable and then when caught on the facts, you claim that your, shall we say 'innocent factual errors' are simply ""rhetoric""."
11/3/2010,"... but im not having trouble dealing with logis... because of two reasons one as ive already said most people are still learning how to use them, that you have to run off to eft to figure out that scorpions are crap against big logi gangs shows that...the second is that critical mass hasnt been reached yet imo. can see this happening pretty soon tbh.notice how this leaves room to be more than able to deal with logis inappropriate language removed. but leaves me wondering what will happen when people finaly catch on?the most concerning thing isnt even that no counter will be found im sure something will come up, the real concern is that people will end up meeting frequently with other logi gangs and neither gang will be capable of inflicting any real damage to the other...rkn that could be pretty friggin boring."
11/3/2010,trolling comments removed. please keep this on topic. discussion of the proposal is ok if you have an issue with someone's posting habits please click on the report button.
11/3/2010,can i report someone for posting in all green?
11/3/2010,"nope mini, your quotes have been posted. -both that you have easy logi counters that you've been using for years and it's easy to counter them (with none of your new nonsense about how unlike every other thing in the entire game, somenhow your easy counters don't scale due to ""critical mass""-and how it's nearly impossible to deal with logistic ships (only later coupled with your epeen nonsense about how everybody other than you sucks at eve and only you understand how to fly logis). but that's okay. you've made two wildly divergent claims if you thought it helped your argument, and you have no way to reconcile your two diametrically opposed statements, so you'd rather spin it in some way or another. ahhh, so that's why you were trolling on that point, you thought it would be a ""gotcha!"" later. of course, it isn't. no, people are not just learning how to use logis, most of us have been using them for years. (oh, i know, other people aren't as awesome as you and blah blah blah). and, of course, as pointed out you simply don't understand basic math. scorpions are not ""crap"" against logis, by any stretch of the imagination. having been in logi wings with sensor strength in the mid 150's and still being jammed out with fair frequency, i know that you are using theorycrafting to eft warrior your way out of a situation that you have no actual understanding of. based on real first hand experience where scorps (and ec drones) have provided significant annoyance to a logi chain, and your eft warrior stance, i'm going to go with reality. also, i'm able to deal with math and it doesn't baffle me that even a three percent chance iterated several time a cycle and cycling several times a minute will most likely lead to several hits over the course of several minutes. but math probably likes the nc, so you can ignore it. i know, surprising! ah, the same sort of doom and gloom psychic prediction nonsense that fortune tellers use. nothing firm or concrete or even specific but at an unspecified time and unspecified critical mass will develop in an unspecified way and it will result in unspecified horrible consequence through an unspecified mechanic but it will happen pretty soon unless you pay them, or uncritically believe what you say. funny that everybody who's tried to educate you on ways you can counter logis understands that the counters scale and there is no mythic 'critical mass'. that is, those who were trying to educate you while you were still arguing that it was virtually impossible before you decided that, really, all along you were arguing that it was trivially easy but only you were cool enough to do to do it right before you decided that, really, all along you were arguing that it's only because you hate the nc that you can easily counter logis but once a mythical 'critical mass' is reached the sky will fall and armageddon will occur. also disco will be popular again. except in reality that's already happened and your nonsense turned out to be false. oh wait oh wait, i know, it's because nobody has as awesome an epeen and everybody but you sucks and blah blah blah and eft beats what actually happens in game."
11/3/2010,i wanted to put back on the table this subject since i think it would be a good opportunity for the players to be involved at the maximum in the events and politics of new eden.both for rp and have as much as possible reason for pvp and other players interactions.this is the precedent tread about the subject:fw and alliance
11/3/2010,"i understand that the universe can be a harsh place you often have to watch your back and watch your wallet too to make sure you aren't cheated by the latest jita chat scam or the like.most scams in eve i think require just a bit of commen sence to understand that something is up. the old saying don't trust someone you do not know goes a long way. but i recently ran into an exploit where a user (or group of users) can list a set of items say in the same region on the market in my case it was the hardwiring - zainou 'gnome' kxa2000 item which was selling on the forge region area. there was a buyer for said item for 25,000,000 for a minimum of 19. so i go around the forge and gather up 19 of the items which cost me around 280 ish million isk. then i go to the station to sell the items and a error pops up and the listing is gone.contacting ccp i got this reply:gm correspondence removed. please see forum rules number 9 for more information. zymurgist --my suggestion is that i think this should not be allowed i believe the simple way is that if a person makes a buy order that requires a set number of items for x price he must put the money up front first. this would insure players that in a multiple item deal they will get the funds.if not that then some way of notifying next to the buy order that requires a set number of items that the creator of the buy order currently has enough funds to fulfill it. i just think this form of scamming /manipulating the market is wrong. i think some scams in eve online is fine but i thnk some scams and manipulation for players who might be new and want to get into trading it just makes them that much more hesitant. scams should only be allowed if they are more or less common sence /trust issues where a smart player can know how to avoid them by the old saying ""trust no one"".i just think that you have to be careful in making eve online ""too real"" in that it can keep a lot of players from getting into the game.the large amount of scams in eve i think personally will keep it from ever being as popular as say games like world of warcraft which can have scams too , as in any game but i just think eve online has too many scams that are allowed for its own good.please don't allow people to fudge the market like this i think this really needs to be brought up to ccp's attention as this kind of exploit should not be allowedthanks."
11/3/2010,you are not allowed to post gm mails.
11/3/2010,"though shall not speack the game of w for it gives it power over your very soulthat said this particular scam type has been known for the last few weeks but is still one of the ones you cant verify by ""looking into it"". bet you didnt know that the people who you bought all those implants from where in fact the scamers selling them at a generaly inflated price to boot.that said the margen trading skill is usefull but it does need a counter.how about if a player places a buy order for 100 items at x price using margin trading they cannot remove isk from there account if it would bring there total account to under what is required to pay for any market orders currently in effect, or should a player have 7 market orders for 100 units of x items and there isk balance is reduced to under the total amount required to pay for said order the orders are imedeatly canceled.or lastly if a player places a market order and does not have enough isk to pay they go into negative isk all market orders are cancled they cant open more and the negative isk is tyed to the account its on not the character so if they try and delete the char they still have the negative isk."
11/3/2010,"in before the lock for posting a gm response.also, welcome to eve, its worse than mos eisley in this place (hive of scum and villany...)"
11/3/2010,"oh look, another ""i've been scammed change the game"" thread. dude, if you can't spot a scam or can't handle being scammed. then perhaps you should consider returning to elf and fairy land. /not supported"
11/3/2010,"while perhaps harsh, this is a fairly accurate view of the matter. scams are not only allowed in eve, they are encouraged. you will, unfortunately, encounter very little sympathy or support."
11/3/2010,"the game is fine, scams are not supposed to be obvious. jita contract scams are not the top of the fraud food chain...htfu"
11/3/2010,"thanks for all the support, people!also that idea for the arrow facing the camera would be also a godsend."
11/3/2010,"certain (n) coalitions are obsessed with comparing this game and wars in 0.0 to iraq vs usa so i thought we would introduce food consumption.this is how things will gowhen two forces collide, (lets say when n vs e), the total morale will be calculated and the side that has more morale will have to pay <trade goods> per person in penalty afterwards.here is an exampleblob 1 = 2100 playersblob 2 = 1000 playersstatistically blob 1 would win due to node crashing, lag and general ******ation, the overall morale will be 3100. if blob 1 wins they will have to celebrate (like in rl) and in effect would have to pay 1100 players in luxury goods.lets say everyone likes caviar, spirits, tobacco, wine and livestock, or the equivalent to 5 mil per person. so say the above blob fest happened and blob 1 won they would have to pay a 5.5 bil penalty in celebrations, parties and foodthis means alliances can still stay blobby as ever but would have to reconsider blobbing, even the rich wont be able to satisfy my appetite note: this only applies when there is a huge size difference and will only apply for the difference which means (based on the above example) blob 1 would have to cover for 850 pilots (25% bigger than the smaller blob)blobs will be worked out through standings and actual attacks (based on fleet)."
11/3/2010,"it's very simple:1. drop booster(and maybe others, i'm not sure) is increases a tracking of capital turrets.2. crash booster is not affects capital missiles. alrough it's should, as shown in eft.so i think it's something wrong here :)"
11/3/2010,you might want to test it ingame before claiming things based on eft. eft itself has bugs aswell.
11/3/2010,"yes, i've asked about this before in other forum and it's has come to a same thing. so i've tested this in game, no effect on missiles(i've checked an actual damage, so this is not a ""info"" bug), and corpmate says that he uses a tracking booster on his dread sometimes."
11/3/2010,"1. what did you shoot at with your dread? what sigradius had the object?2. if you go to the fitting screen then hover your launcher and select ""show info"" for the ammo the missile explosion radius didnt change before and after taking the booster?more facts really."
11/3/2010,"1. sleepers :) with some painters and webs, damage is around 21k, which isn't changes. even with painters, explosion radius is far more bigger than signature radius, explosion velocity is enough. (btw it's has a good alpha, so i'm not complaining, it's just about boosters which i think should influence all caps or none at all. in case someone will troll about such use of a dread or anything)2. no, it's didn't changes."
11/3/2010,"while i like this idea, this would infact limit the sandbox and some enterprising pilot would be out of a possible mini profession.this is a perfect oppurtunity for someone(s) to make a service."
11/3/2010,"theres a point in case for arguing why if you're flying in a frig gang u shouldnt have a trailing interdicter to set up bubbles to slow down any backup someone calls in.really the only thing that would be an addition would be a frig based repping platform. ...although a couple of t2 logistics a good distance away would do that well. would have issues of maneuverability but with points, webs, etc.. on the frigs around the target, the target wouldnt get anywhere to be effective, any weapons systems could be countered with that many different frigs and mid slot choices.there are ways to do what you want... just not in a solo aspect. eve online is ment to be something that encourages teamwork and co-operation, whether good or evil!"
11/3/2010,"the burden of proof should be on the player. realistically, if they start tracking down on claims of exploits, then they're not gonna have time to investigate every claim. especially bogus ones."

11/3/2010,"okay im no great fan of test, or it/bob/t20.the issue that has me worried is the inconsistant and quite frankly blatantly biased descision making of the gm's in this issue.we know that gm's are basically free to do as they wish citing the ""interpritation"" get out clause. however when bias is as clear as this and the gm wagon train is circling for all its worth (no public discussion of this decision?? are you serious??)it is time to call in a 3rd party to investigate what exactly happened and why. while i understand that many feel the csm is a talking shop for ccp to fill with hot air, it is instances like this that they should be investigating. ccp you want to regain the credibility you have lost yet again by a biased decision? open your doors to the csm and let them investigate.*********************************************edit for latest case of gm abuse/incompetance*********************************************can we also add in the latest incident, a legal war dec being cancelled by a gm, with the usual ccp whitewash reply???seriously it seems some gms are just not up to the jobgm incompetance"
11/3/2010,"oddly enough, isn't that what the ccp internal affairs division already does?"
11/3/2010,"it were the only ones initially to petition it.the use of extended downtime to take sov is blatantly wrong.everyone else has got in on the act and all downtime actions have been dealt with.cry less, the sensationalism only makes you look more stupid."
11/3/2010,"with ccp's previous history of internal inquires (t20, ferrogel et al), i would be safe in saying that any result that a ccp employee came out with would be biased towards the company.this needs a nominally neutral party, one that is not paid by the very people who made the decision."
11/3/2010,"wow yes lets waste everyones time with something non-controversial at all. goons/test are making fools of themselves all over eve, the correct response is to ignore the ******s."
11/3/2010,afaik the other tcus form other alliances were removed as well so it is no real favourism per se. because the dt tcu onlining is kind of an exploit
11/3/2010,"to be honest its a simple matter that this has never been punished before, the original punishment was to offline the tcu's and then *shock horror* they ""accidently"" get destroyed, and then rather than respawning the tcu's offline in the systems the gms just shrug their shoulders and walk away from it.it has never before been called an exploit (see previous instances of this being done) and the actions of the gms are suspect in the least."
11/3/2010,"since when was the csm capable of running investigations, i think you have misjudged there purpose and there reach to be honest, they don't have access to the resources they need to do what you are suggesting, they bring the issues we raise as the playerbase to ccp that's all."
11/3/2010,this. test is acting like a toddler that did not get his binky and is now throwing a tantrum. grow the **** up. **** happens that you may not like over the course of your life. throwing a tantrum like a 3 year old is not going to help your cause at all.
11/3/2010,"again the point remains that the other tcu's were only removed after petitions.i am happily awaiting the banning of market trading exploitation, contract scammers and anyone who is using in game mechanics to gain an advantage.do you think this will happen? well only if its a itbob petition"
11/3/2010,and thus proving op is a ******.
11/3/2010,...ok test alt. please attempt to waste everyone's time more. in fact you should send an angry letter. because nobody cares.
11/3/2010,tests were removed hours before the others. the others were removed after test petitioned for fair treatment. this tactic has been used for years and it wasn't a problem until it happened to an alliance that ccp has shown favoritism before.
11/3/2010,"coming from sys-fail, no wait thats too easy im sure theres some kittens to drown around here, it would be more challenging"
11/3/2010,"cms has nothing to do with this. test was using unfair advantage, and they got punished. end of story. live with that, or stop posting and quit the game. goons/test always tried to **** up the game, they tired numerous times to use exploits etc."
11/3/2010,why bob alts are the best
11/3/2010,"hey, it had a unfair advantage when the delve sov fell, we demand a rollback!"
11/3/2010,"i would like to point out that contract scams are a built in mechanic and is works as intended, however this whole tcu thing was not intended to be possible, hence the onlining timer that allows counter attackwhen people find a way around that built in vulnerability then it sure as hell is an exploit"
11/3/2010,"we used a game mechanic that every 0.0 alliance has used, including it."
11/3/2010,"wow really? you mad? dude nobody cares about your temper-tantrum... bashing someone's alliance has nothing to do with it. (coming from someone who hides behind an alt) if you'd like i'll post with a different alt... is this what you want? keep your thread on topic... or keep flailing that seems to be working for ya. to flail; def: to beat or thrash about, uncontrollably"
11/3/2010,"until test crawls out from under goon's skirt and survives on it's own, no one will care about them except the members. your alliance is a joke. your leadership is a joke. your membership is a joke. you are a scar on the face of eve and i hope each and every one of you who spam petitioned gets perma-banned for wasting gm's time from other legit petitions.and before you say it: yes, i am mad that i have to shift through one alliances **** posts all over the forums. i know it is a cool story, bro!"
11/3/2010,":sigh:no im not an alt, i am an honest to goodness main, dont beleive me check on bc.paranoia - def you"
11/3/2010,this is such a non-event. despite the best efforts of test frankly nobody cares. i certainly don't want the csm wasting its time poking about ccps cupboards. c.
11/3/2010,"people afraid of losing ships ... decided to put the tcus up shortly before an extended downtime for patch maintenance. knowing this was going to happen, they circumvented a massive mechanic for claiming sovereignty, and in-so-doing used an exploit to capture multiple systems without needing to field the appropriate fleets to defend their tcus. ---quendishir"
11/3/2010,"test is really making themselves look stupid. and consistently demanding that everyone care/respond positively to their personal struggles would be entertaining if it wasn't so annoying. if any of this was legitimate test/goons wouldn't be running around spamming/trolling our dead, boring, broken forums."
11/3/2010,obvious it/bob/kenzoku/gm/dev alt trying to spin their crap
11/3/2010,"haha im no csm but heres my thought anyway. you are both wrongaltho dropping the tcus before the extended downtime was kind of lame, the systems were unclaimed, there was nothing to defend per se. it had no horse in this race. it had no business crying fool over some systems they dont even fracking own."
11/3/2010,"it was a nice try from test, but dont whine when it doesnt work out as planned. even my pet hamster understands that this is a reasonable decission from gms since normal gameplay limitations were evaded, and my pet hamster is dead."
11/3/2010,obvious test/goon/nc alt trying to spin their crap
11/3/2010,"the point is all the tcu's that were removed, were removed after petitions. so where is the inconsistency?"
11/3/2010,"wow, many of you folks are really stupid.the tcus were destroyed during the downtime. the tcus setup by others in the same period were not destroyed until enough folks petitioned them and it was done two hours after the downtime ended (so they were able to take advantage of them for a bit).ccp claims that this new rule is also retroactive. do you have any idea how many alliances have used this in the past? if ccp was truly going to apply this retroactively, there would be thousands of systems lost as this was a huge game mechanic when patch downtime occurs.not only that, but ccp keeps iterating that this is only tcu related. i'm not sure why using timers and patch downtime in other situations (like, timing a pos to come out of reinforcement during downtime or dropping many other types of structures) is perfectly acceptable but, as of the past few days, tcus are not allowed.this is even more ridiculous because a gm actually has an alt in it (the same gm that destroyed all of the tcus). very suspicious that these tcus were immediately destroyed by a gm who has an it in the space where they were dropped and yet nothing happened to anyone else who dropped tcus at the same-time until a few hours after downtime."
11/3/2010,every alliance that has deployed sov stuff has used dt (normal or extended) to minimise the risks. if putting an outpost up coincided with an extended dt then if you don't think that was used then i got a bridge for you.they'd have been dumb not to.i'd be willing to bet that if test had put up maybe 2 or 3 tcus then this wouldn't have been any sort of issue at all. fourteen is the problem. anyone with half a brain can see test did it just to take the p*ss out of it and/or ccp.tl;dr if you're going to use dodgy but accepted mechanics then don't rub ccps face in it by taking the p*ss. if you do then this is what happens.
11/3/2010,moved from general discussion.
11/3/2010,"all the tcu that were petitioned and found to have most of their onlining time fall in the extended dt have been taken care of. the test ones destroyed were replaced by gms as were the funds for the sov fees. the argument, if there should be one at all, is whether ccp should allow (or continue to allow if you want to look at it that way) the anchoring during extended dt or if this policy is fine. either way, there's no scandel here."
11/3/2010,"so basically, they're at fault for not seeing the others when dotlan was flooded with 14 new systems? i doubt ccp would have done anything if 1-2 systems were claimed after downtime. yes, downtime was abused pre-dominion for pos timing and that sort of thing, but you could still do something about it when the server came back up. with 14 systems to sbu and shoot at for hours...that's a different story.i think what crossed the line was what i highlighted in my previous point. there is a difference between timing reinforce timers for downtime and a tcu onlining. abusing the extended downtime so there was nothing anyone could do about the onlining tcus (unclaimed systems or not) was what ccp saw and thus took action against.as for the other tcus...they were likely taken down later because it went unnoticed. yours would have as well if you grabbed maybe 2 systems. but hey, let's all whine about an obvious flaw in the game mechanics that provide unfair advantages shall we?"
11/3/2010,"you sir have hurt my feelings, i demand a apology immediately. i'm crying at the keyboard and i think i may quit eve."
11/3/2010,"more testy emo tears, please. makes eve somewhat interesting again. and yeah, epic idea to have the csm launch a full-scale investigation and demand from ccp to disclose all relevant facts related to this. because we all know that is so gonna happen... gl with that testy/goons/shrubberies/pubbies."
11/3/2010,you guys wanna know how i know you don't care? everyone keeps posting about how they don't care.
11/3/2010,"i don't see the problem, looks like ccp were notified of people taking advantage and so fixed the problem. after being notified of others doing the same thing, they dealt with them too.if you do something knowing that you can get unintended benefits from it, you should expect that theres always a chance that you'll be caught. there is however the issue of either ccp not being aware of this problem in the first place and if they were why was it allowed to continue?"
11/3/2010,"there is an issue here. i have not been party or have first hand knowledge of the communication between test and gms. however, if what has been reported elsewhere is to be believed it has not been classified as an exploit. rather it has been referred to as ingenious timing which have been giving players an unfair advantage. i believe it was not even referred to as a true unfair advantage, but just one of sorts.(gms: i really am trying to stay on the correct side of the rules here. but i realise that i can easily be faulted for overstepping. my only question would be how shall the player base then ever be able to convey opinions between themselves  and to the cms  and have a meaningful discussion about gm actions.) the issue here is then not someone having used an exploit or anything of the likes. test seems to have just had too much isk and their usual want for messing around. ccp sells this game as a harsh place. learn game mechanics and live by them. if a rookie falls for a can flipper or baiter outside a rookie system, too bad. there is no reimbursement. this in ccps view, must then be fair. but someone looking at a map and seeing a bunch of open systems, checking a calendar and seeing downtime and acting upon it is unfair. and unfair, while not an exploit, leads to intervention. so this saved it alliance some hours of shooting tcus. the question is, was this the correct way to handle it? would it have been better to take the rl approach and say that this act may or may not demonstrate a need for some new rules. and if new rules are required make them valid for what is done from the time at which those rules are put into function. was this really serious enough for the rule to be implemented not only for future cases but also to be utilised retroactively? i dont have the answer for that, but i believe that this kind of discussions are precisely the kinds that the cms need to address towards ccp if the organ shall have any justification. on a personal note to tamber. according to the transfer thread you are the new owner of that character. why do you post with it? argumentation has many ways to reach its potential, argumentation is one and pre-existing reputation another. why do you utilise the latter when it isnt yours?"
11/3/2010,sorry its still me. :|
11/3/2010,then my sincere appologies. and glad to have met you before you changed persona
11/3/2010,"i just wanted to say that in my ceo's communication with the gm in question, we could not get a solid answer as to how long before downtime is ok. additionally, in a petition from one of my other alliance members, ccp grave failed to see the parallels between timing structures to online during downtimes (extended or otherwise) and timing pos to come out of reinforced during downtime. i would post the logs, but apparently that is not allowed on the eve-o forums.the long and short of it is that we're not receiving any specific rules as to how this brand-new policy will be implemented, which is frustrating to say the least. how can we make strategic decisions without specific guidelines? moreover, how can a gm ensure his or her decision is just without some kind of outside measurement? perhaps a timer which seems suspect to ccp lalouche would not seem suspect to ccp grave. without a guideline, who is to say which one is correct?"
11/3/2010,"probably because:1) writing a program that check what percentage of a process is completed during dt and what percentage is completed outside dt, with variable duration daily dt, unexpected dt and programmed extended dt that can last for a longer or shorter period than the one scheduled is a nightmare;2) because probably a program doing that will be so full of bugs and touch so many seemingly unrelated things that it would require months of patches to the patch that patch the patch before really functioning and a lot of developer time. so it is better to let the gm handle the problem when someone petition and let the stuff stay if no one care about the onlining.probably after this the number of petitions for dt onlining will increase but the time the gm will spend on this will still cost less than the developer time required stop it changing the eve program."
11/3/2010,"the idea that the gms should decide what form of onlining structures into downtime is egregious or not is ludicrous. there's simply no difference between us onlining 14 tcus and someone onlining, say, a single small tower in contested low sec ( or even hi sec! ). there should be hard rules that apply to everyone equally.you can try and say that the 14 tcus are a bigger deal, but they aren't. in small corp warfare a single tower is just as important to that small corp as the tcus were to a huge alliance. rules are rules, they cannot be arbitrarily decided, they must be applied equally to all.that requires that the rules be stated and adhered to. anything else is favoritism. you're implying that one paying customer ( a large alliance leader ) is more important than another ( a small or solo corp leader ). they both pay the same amount per month."
11/3/2010,"i created an assembly hall thread on the fitting issues of ammars only laser dmg bonused cruiser the omen.omen(issue)so far it has been floating around the front page with as of today:36 statments of support by different people, and 35 supports.4 direct supports against.i would like to know the possibility of bringing the omen fitting buff to ccp's attention for the reasons stated in the preposal.thank you for your time."
11/4/2010,no.
11/4/2010,"you missed out, it was on sunday lols.-t'amber"
11/4/2010,noand i have canceled my accounts if it turns out to be cosmetic only then i will return.if they fundamentally change the game with microwhatsits then this is my last post.
11/4/2010,"i see several people suggesting that the kitsune is more or less okay. this is an understandable conclusion; unlike many of the eafs it does work. however, this functionality is more a reflection upon the effectiveness of ecm than the ship. it is an expensive t2 frigate that is only marginally better in some ways than its t1 counterpart while being actually worse in other critical ways. that aside, ew offers an opportunity to add real tactical depth to the game. a fleet that elects to go this route should be every bit as effective as a fleet that goes for straight spank and tank, and arguably even more."
11/4/2010,"supported, wanna' hyena that is somewhat better than a vigil...."
11/4/2010,"this is a suggestion for what would be possibly a lot of work, but i feel would be very well received within the community. the suggestion is this.1. first off, all the pirate ships that are missing unique models should be given them. ditch the reskins, and make them their own hulls. 2. replace the generic stations in pirate space with unique pirate stations. this could be as simple as one pirate station for each race, or as complex as each type of station having its own hull.3. for each major trade hub, and corporation, and factional headquarters, create a unique station, like the roden centre. it'd be a lot of work, but it'd be amazing when done, it would really give people some real reasons to go sightseeing, provide some real landmarks to visit."
11/4/2010,do want. been waiting for updated pirate station models since trinity.
11/4/2010,naturally the only time the sansha bandwagon with an angel is when they stand to benefit as well.edit: :) comical smile addedi would think it be quite easy to convert some of the existing battlestations into pirate stations (if war installations that imitate existing stations are any indication).

11/4/2010,then don't forget to check the support box :)
11/4/2010,"supporting this, definitely."
11/4/2010,"i like this take on wardeccing. the argument is not that the mechanic is broken, but more that the prices are outdated. with this i agree. 100mil/200mil means that you need to work to make it financially viable. war is supposed to be expensive."
11/4/2010,well that would be also a solution for highsec wars. no corps and alliances made by highsec players means no reason to fight wars in highsec at all. congratulations your suggestion kills highsec warefare even more than higher fees for wars.
11/4/2010,"again, you are overcomplicating the system for no good reason. still not supported."
11/4/2010,always annoyed me. supported (although low priority)
11/4/2010,"thanks every1 for the support in this topic... and for a lil bit of multimedia in the discussion follow the link to see exactly what i mean about avoiding obsticles and changing direction in warp. and bare in mind the whole game runs smoothly on a 400mhz 64mb pentium 3, physics, spacebattles n all!independance war 2 - edge of chaos gameplaythe intro looks at cool things bout ship setup and changes u can make in space, then the physics engine and how inertia is modeled into piloting in space2:25secs - shows u warp with manual control.. and its a ***** to control!3:27secs - shows what i want to impliment... autopilot controlled approach that aviods planetary bodies.the rest is a lil bit of space **** battling for u to enjoy! :)"
11/4/2010,"1. letting your standing to the originator of a proposal bias your opinion on it is petty to say the least.2. i never pushed a proposal on anyone's behalf (in fact i have voted against bad proposals from members on multiple occasions). you demonstrate exactly what i'm trying to avoid: just because i'm alliance _whatever_ people assume i must be pushing personal agendas, it's inconceivable that i'm actually trying to make the game better"
11/4/2010,"1. fyi, the op and i don't even know each other. and u don't have to take my word for it because even if i was lying, that would be more reason to support this proposal anyway.2. so how is it even the least bit conceivable that u're making the game better by trying to block this proposal on an alt? u honestly think if u posted on your alt rather than your alliance main, it's better because of the stigma avoided, which somehow makes it valid? here's the thing--regardless of whether or not there's an ulterior motive behind something, if u give good support (aka quality not quantity) and refute the opposition (aka not ignoring them), it won't matter because even if u had an agenda, the argument would still be valid. therefore, good posts give the associated party a good outlook, while **** posts reflect a bad outlook, aka the stigma. and that's why the only reason u would not post on your main is because u know it's a **** post with no valid arguments that would stigmatize your affiliation, which can only lead back to the conclusion that u're trying to nerf others and buff yourselves with more trolling alts. and we all know it as well so u can stop pretending it's anything else. at least with your main, u'll be held accountable and we'll know who the idiot/troll really is. maybe then u'll think twice before making your affiliation look stupid and risking your removal from it. the only thing demonstrated here is exactly why this proposal will truly make the game better. and your continued self-defeating attempts, as well as others, to derail this proposal only furthers it. and these self-defeating attempts range from accusing me of ****-posting, working in collusion with the op, and the ""htfu"" after denying us the ability to hold their mains accountable (which is admitting they can't handle the supposed ""risk"" of trolling in an internet spaceship forum, despite hiding behind an entire alliance no less). but plz, continue to block an anti-trolling proposal with more trolling--it's really convincing...on our behalf."
11/4/2010,"i do believe the orgianl proposal:it has nothing to do with what you are ranting on about.so please stay on topic with the op's proposal, you have done nothing but troll and derail this thread."
11/4/2010,"l2read and l2think, stupid troll. there's no difference at all, whether it's across one thread or multiple--it's still one char per account. but thx for ignoring everything else with a stupid, half-assed response like u always do. way to represent your alliance...again...so plz continue--at least the other trolls can find some entertainment in a thread against them."
11/4/2010,"no you are pushing for the main to post only. the op states and posts with his alt to make a point.so yeah, you get a 3/10 for trying."
11/4/2010,"and obviously, u're too stupid to figure out what that point was, which is that alts can be abused to make something look better than it really is. and that's why in order for ppl to see the good points, they have to sort through the clutter of garbage, something u clearly have no trouble creating. way to talk out of your ass.so yeah, u get a -10/10 for trying 'cause many other trolls fail less than u."
11/4/2010,"u mad?because you really sound mad. if you have to resort to using terms like ""stupid"", ""ass"" and to try to brow beat someone that opposes your stance... you are proving your self too inept to actually argue your point, and you should not be one to articulate some else's point of view."
11/4/2010,"and yet it describes a troll like u perfectly--conversely, u have to resort to ignoring everything else u can't troll, including refutes, nitpick on trivial or imaginary issues to derail the topic, and best of all, u cry over name-calling after u already cried ""tard"". furthermore, u accuse others of what u're doing aka hypocrisy. and last but not least, u've done all of the above in one single post! the real question would be:r you mad?'cause u sound really mad. p.s. if u think trolling/raging on your main will magically absolve everyone else who trolls on their 3-alts x account total, think again--it's not. and for u to ""try"" this hard in doing so, especially without any merit behind your ranting, can only lead to the conclusion that u're probably one of them as well. so plz continue some more as a lesson in futility--it's pretty entertaining."
11/4/2010,you are demonstrating the behavior you claim you wish to stop. you incessant rantings of self importance is leading down a dark path of fail. stop now and repent.
11/4/2010,deleted for double posting.
11/4/2010,"or what? u'll troll some more 'cause that's all u know how to do? ok. do unto others as they would do unto u. u troll me, i troll u. the fact is we've made our point (well u and the other trolls to be exact) and u've got nothing. 'cause no matter what u do, it doesn't change the lack of content in other threads infested by trolling alts. u've already lost--that's why it's futile and stupid for u to even try. your move."
11/4/2010,"there are three that i know of that do not make any sense and may have been posted before.firstly jump bridge do not allow alliance member to use it unless they have a password and to make it worse it's not a different password and has to use the same as the pos shields.it should have a settings:allow use for corp/alliance/standingspassword use for corp/alliance/standings.secondly bubbles and points stop people from jumping, now considering that the bridges are meant to act like gates why does pointing a non aggressed ship stop it from jumping.it just seems really weird.lastly jump bridges don't take fuel from your cargo which is a bit of a hassle for some people as you don't know exactly how much fuel you need and then have to put that amount fuel into the bridge."
11/4/2010,"absolutely. it's about time that every jb doesn't require you to re-enter a password. gates are different from bridges and i don't really have a problem with prohibiting ships from using a bridge if it can't activate its warp drive. bridges are more like jump drives anyways, and you can't jump out if you're scrammed. there should be some sort of script that the server runs that checks the jb itself for fuel and if it doesn't find it, looks in the ship that's activating it and asks the pilot if he wants to use x units of lo to jump through."
11/4/2010,"i support allowing jbs to have a separate password from pos shields, at the very least.in regards to the not knowing how much fuel you need to jump, there actually is a formula for it, but it involves knowing the distance of the jump in order to calculate the fuel required."
11/4/2010,"""lastly jump bridges don't take fuel from your cargo which is a bit of a hassle for some people as you don't know exactly how much fuel you need and then have to put that amount fuel into the bridge.""yes please. the rest of your idea is garbage."
11/4/2010,"i'm very aware of it but there isn't an easy to work it out in game which is more of the problem, unlike jump fuel it varies dependant on the ship you are flying.your entitled to your own opinions."
11/4/2010,"""absolutely. it's about time that every jb doesn't require you to re-enter a password.""it just occured to me you have spent about 5 pages on the other jb thread claiming i wanted easy mode for eve because i wanted to have alliance only use of jbs..."
11/4/2010,you're not particularly good at drawing logical conclusions.
11/4/2010,i just thought it was a little funny...
11/4/2010,"mmm hmmmm.hilariously funny. why, your desire for easy mode is totally the same thing as not wanting to have to hit g5, g6, g7, etc... for the various bridges. getting rid of a minor annoyance is the same as your desire for easy mode. perceptive. yep."
11/4/2010,"if you still cant see why this would be in a problem after all this time(well for one im certainly not going to convinse you)... there are two answers... you are just being stuborne or you have just not played from outside a super-coalition in a long long time.""yeh whats the problem... why dont you just put supercaps in a system two times into a system (one time while people are expecting it) to destroy a jb... which can be put right back up again, against someone who can field at least 5-6 times the numbers of supercaps and 10-20 times the number of support most other groups can."""
11/4/2010,"yet again, called it. and this is the same basic problem as before. some people want to play the game and understand that if they're unable to fight effectively against a large group of people, then either they need to adapt to that situation (like, say, burn eden has done spectacularly) or they need to find an area of the game where the dynamic is different. like, small-gang roaming. they understand that ""and the enemy might have more guys!"" is not a gameplay mechanics problem that suggests that they run to the assembly hall and demand that ccp save them. that's because they understand the game, understand how cooperation and combat works, and understand that they're the only one's responsible for their success or failure in the game. other people don't get that, at all. if they don't have the resources or tactics to compete against a much larger group of people, then ccp needs to save them and alter the game specifically to help them. that this so often happens to be tied to anti-this-powerbloc-or-that-powerbloc trolling is, of course, coincidental. of course. when you're arguing the logis are broken because some people may be able to field more than you are,and pos's are broken because defenders may be able to field more than you are, and triage carriers are broken because defenders may be able to field more than you are with a support fleet larger than you can field, and pos modules are broken because defenders may be able to field more people than you are, and jump bridges are broken because defenders may be able to field more than you are... well, it's probably a good hint that the problem isn't really with game mechanics, at all."
11/4/2010,"fallacious reasoning ftw... jb's are ******ed to the point that any lemmming can do freighter runs on its own. i get you enjoy trolling miningin, fine, but right now you look like a total douche. nullsec shoudn't be the place for the lazy's playing easy mode and you perfectly know it."
11/4/2010,"using words you don't understand ftl. but please, explain which specific logical fallacy you allege has been committed. go for it. also worth noting is that you only pretended to answer what i actually posted and then changed the subject (that'd be the fallacy of non sequitor, btw). i was discussing mini's consistent arguments for why he is impotent to effect change in eve/counter enemies/incap mods/destroy pos's/etc and why they miss the point and deliberately obscure the fact that there is supposed to be choice in this game and if you're unable to play a certain style, then you can choose another one rather than demanding that ccp save you and alter the game so you don't have to make any choices. you tried to change the subject to an argument that jump bridges are somehow ""easy mode"" because a freighter can jump through them. of course, while never explaining why the ability to use a jump/titan bridge is easy mode (fallacy of begging the question). most likely because there was nothing you could say other than the bare assertion, and it makes no sense that a carrier being able to jump is totally in line with game mechanics, but other ships using the same exact game mechanics are just horrible. horrible! proving that you have no idea how the game actually works. a freighter can do runs on its own? of course, this is as absurd as the claim that it's ""risk free"" to jump blind into a bridge/cyno system. the number of times that neuts/reds have had a single cyno scout post up on a bridge and then bridged in a dread/supercarrier to kill a freighter/jump freighter/carrier simply goes to show that not only do you not have a clue what you're talking about, but you're using your fictions and ignorance of the game as a club. indeed, which is why i object to your ignorance-based trolling and nonsense about how being able to jump blind into a potential ambush is ""easy mode""."
11/4/2010,"ok.. well i said supercaps to demonstrate how ridiculously easy it is to incap and destroy the bridge without even bothering with a reinforcement timer. it is very possible as i have seen it done many times.i have also been with a team of stealth bombers several times which took out large deathstar pos. so, if you want super easy mode then yes you can do it with supercaps. or with a bit more skill a group of people in cheap bombers can take it out as well.either way, there are plenty of ways to deal with a pos whether you are a super alliance or a single corp. all you have to do is use a bit of your brain to come up with a solution."
11/4/2010,"come now. people have been trying to educate mini for literally days now on why his problem isn't a problem at all and both pos's and jb's can be dealt with. it hasn't worked so far. largely, i'd wager, because mini's argument is based around his claims that since he can't accomplish certain things in eve, ccp has to save him and alter the game specifically so he doesn't have to make any choices. folks have also pointed out that if you want to be able to challenge a large group of people in eve, you have to be capable of fighting them and if you're not, you need to make the choice to do something else or to adapt and find viable tactics. mini doesn't want that. he doesn't want to have to choose between small-gang and large-scale warfare, he wants to be able to challenge thousands of people working together and if they're able to, as he's complained, raise a larger fleet than he is, than he wants ccp to simply remove the structures that he'd otherwise have to fight over, so he no longer has to make the choice and ccp simply punishes his enemies since he can't do it with his guns."
11/4/2010,you are awesome thx mate
11/4/2010,"and you're trolling, please stop mate. you ignored the fact that you alleged a fallacy but can't point one out. indeed, you ignored that and tried to change the subject.you ignored the fact that being able to jump to remote locations with structures/titans/jump drives is a specifically designed feature and game mechanics working as intended. indeed, you ignored that and tried to change the subject. now, inexplicably, you're trolling on the point that being able to jump blind into a potential ambush is hardly ""easy mode"" and is in fact a very good way to lose an expensive ship and its cargo. evidently jumping blind through a gate is also ""easy mode"". and, naturally, you ignored that and tried to change the subject."
11/4/2010,"this is litteraly what has happend in this threadi say something along the lines of - jumpbridges promote an unfun/unmanagable style of play.you say - jump bridges can be dealt with.i say - not in a fun/effective/managable way, that is to say they promote unfun/unmanagable style of playyou say - ive addressed your issues... they can be dealt with...ok... good luck with that..."
11/4/2010,"again mini, you lack basic understanding of what you're arguing:and again you are pretending that you are the emperor of fun and only you get to define what fun is. likewise, if you're impotent to effect a specific change, it must be not just unmanageable but an all-caps barrage of screaming that it is ""unmanageable"". even when people try to educate you on perfectly effective counters, you resist. even when people point out that if you can't handle dealing with pos's then the answer is to choose to do something else in eve, or adapt and find tactics that don't fail, and instead your reaction is that ccp needs to alter the game in order to save you. and yes, that is exactly what's been going on during the entire thread. you argue for your own in-game impotence when it comes to effecting any sort of change, people try to point out that you're not as powerless as you want to claim and that even if you were, that there are other things in eve you can do, and you again just loop back to arguing for how powerless you are to effect change."
11/4/2010,"you are ridiculous... just because you say something doesnt make it true... i challenge you to to take a 45 man gang as you have suggested and go hit the delve jb network...looking forward to your results. oh and the ""fun"" you have doing it. remember to give a big cheer when you are done reinforcing it..."
11/4/2010,"ah, i see you're ignoring all the actual counters posted and still arguing for your own in-game impotence. this is novel and unexpected. likewise, you are again arguing for an anti-choice position where a 45 man group should, definitely, be able to challenge much larger forces and ccp has to save them if they can't, rather than groups chosing their engagements based on what they can accomplish and the tactics they have figured out. again, the emperor of fun speaking ex cathedra about what people can and can't enjoy and how they should and shouldn't play the game, and why ccp needs to directly intervene and save him so he doesn't have to adapt.thank you, emperor, thank you."
11/4/2010,"personally i think it is you and your alliance that is ridiculous, the other day i was going to jump my jf to seed a low sec market and your 30 man hydra gang spent the best part of an hour chasing and camping my cyno alt around low sec and smacking when she docked up, great eh! all that effort to try and gank a probe with no weapons.now you talk about taking down a full regions jump bridges with a 45 man gang, if that is your method you are doing it wrong, 45 man gang in supercarriers would have no problem, hell even 1 supercarrier makes short work of a pos.we now get onto the thing that i wanted to mention, you had an alliance that could in effect cause headaches for major space holding alliances, 1500 man if i remember correctly but you couldn't resist scamming them for as much as you could, this is why you can't have nice things, nobody wants to help you cos' you are unreliable and petty.live with it."
11/4/2010,"say it for me ""seiging poses and jbs is fun""... otherwise i think im relatively safe in my assumption.and no thats not a friggin counter... that is the cause of the problem... having to drop 45 scs to down a jb is encouraging giant numbers the server cant handle in the event such a thing happens...wether to save your own or to kill people who do that to you.if there was a counter that didnt require you to drop giant numbers or scs on jbs then sure... this isnt related to the problem of leading towards the game being more and more laggy with more and more problems with less and less fun.but as it is... your ""counter"" is directly related to the problem that ccp greyscale was underlining. and that is that ""the jb networks lead further away from a playable/more frequently engagable/more sandboxy(each player has a real impact as opposed to a lag impact) game""and as such it is not about ""crying"" about the counter... but saying that your ""counter"" is part of the problem."
11/4/2010,"this makes no sense, pl and the russians have just proved how effective a sc gang is at destroying infrastructure, just because you have not got that capability and are unable to have it due to your alliance reputation of unreliability and scamming, who would want to join an alliance with a sc alt when they don't know wether they are going to be killed by their own alliance mates or not, or have their sc stolen, does not mean the mechanic is broken, as i said live with it, your alliance screwed the pooch."
11/4/2010,"the same errors over and over and over and over and over... it's like your argument is trapped in one of the lower circles of hell. as usual, readers should note that mini is lying and has invented yet another quote that doesn't actually exist. yah, it's just a thing you can do in-game, following in-game mechanics that are working as designed, that allows you to effectively deal with and neutralize opposition. oh, wait, that is exactly what a counter is. but because it shows you're totally wrong, you're going to try to ignore-it-away. now you're just making things up. 45 people in system, why, that's nearly a number that the server just can't handle! and of course, your whine isn't even really about jb's, it's just another handy issue you've found to try to hammer on any group that's larger than the one you find yourself in. the same objection you have to jb's (zomg, someone might defend them!) is the same you'd have to pos's in general, moon mining, capital ship construction, drug manufacture, research pos's... the argument is, again, why you demand that you're powerless within the game and why ccp has to deliberately alter the game to save you, rather than you just finding something you're good at and doing that instead. small numbers via supers? that's horrible!large numbers via a regular fleet? that's horrible!moderate numbers via a bomber gang? that's horrible! ccp altering the game so that people who can't manage to counter pos's don't have to? awesome! yes, it is is crying about the counters, plus saying that being able to actually do things in eve is a ""problem"" but that having ccp fix things so that you don't have to actually do anything to compete with larger forces is a ""solution""."
11/4/2010,"i dont think you ""get"" hydra alliance and i bet you got scammed by them...you guys have spent the better part of the thread saying that we can not dictate how people play this game, yet the only thing dictating 0.0 politics atm is the ability to just form these giant napfests.someone was saying the other day at the start of the game it should give you an option ""coalition a"" or ""coalition b"" - thats what your sandbox game is coming down to...and im pretty sure if you had any clue about whats going on in eve atm you would know why pl is having success (perhaps more than they otherwise would be having) should things be slightly different. im not sure why people are pretty stoked that to accomplish anything in this game you must have at least 50 scs and this is their evidence for how things arnt broken."
11/4/2010,"good grief, you simply do not understand the game at all. in other words, while you refuse to adapt and demand that ccp alter game mechanics to save you, other people are pointing out that players themselves being able to work in concert and carve out player created and player run empires in 0.0 is game mechanics functioning as designed. you're actually arguing that having to play in an mmo with other people (oh no!!!) who define how conflict will play out is the problem and instead, getting the game developers to specifically modify the game so that you don't have to actually manage to compete with superior forces? well, that's the solution. twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe... again, arguing for your own in-game impotence. and you're surprised that you're unable to accomplish things. of course, you're not required to live in 0.0 spaced. you're not required to participate in large-scale sov warfare if you do. you're not required to join any coalition at all. but you're unable and/or unwilling to adapt, so you believe that the correct course of action is for ccp to save you and remove the levels of choice we already have in the game. ahh, the delightful ""i can't come up with effective tactics therefore... you are bad at eve!"" plus some gobbledy**** about why ""pl is having success"" ""should things be slightly different"". again you are screaming in all caps to hide the fact that you have no point, at all. you can accomplish a great many things without supers. you are whining that you want to be able to engage in conflict with entities many times your size, but you don't want to actually have to do what's required to fight them so you'd rather that ccp just alter the game to save you. but of course you'd prefer to lie and claim that people cannot do anything in the game, at all, except engage in large scale conflicts in nullsec."
11/4/2010,"lol, no i didn't get scammed by them, a simple bait and switch is easy to see, my point is that you are unreliable and vindictive and although you had the chance to be a contender and take the big boys on ypu blew it for iskies, anybody in their right mind with a suitably skilled character will not join you for that reason, due to that you are crying because you can't compete and want the game dumbed down to your level.why don't you go and scam someone over it or spend 30 man hours chasing a weaponless probe who, by the way had a whale of a time avoiding you and laughing at your incompetence, blob much btw, you are guilty of doing exactly the same to the noobs and small corps as the bigger boys do to you and nobody wants to join you because of your attitude and reputation, so carry on with your 1337 pvp.that would be the reason you are posting in green, jealous much"
11/4/2010,thread cleaned. please refrain from running personal attacks/trolling in this thread.
11/4/2010,"im not sure if your issue is with my argument about jbs or with hydra alliance.it seems like you are trying to disprove what i am saying by saying ""ah you are in hydra alliance"" well not only does this have no relevance at all, but i would point out that i have only been in hydra for a couple of days and for the record im not sure if any hydra guys are vindictive or bitter towards space holding entities. from what ive seen of them they really dont give a **** what the rest of eve is doing they are just doing what suites them.and for the record i think they are p. chill about how they play the game, not that i always see eye to eye with all of them. but i just dont see how your rant about hydra alliance at all nullifies and again i will restate my position...everything about jumpbridges encourages larger coalitions to hold more space which is going unused, which in turn promotes less fights, more blobby fights where the server often struggles, less emphasis on the player (which i thought eve was meant to be about). this encouragement of this style of play is of detrement to the majority of the community.insistance that ""jumpbridges can be countered by shooting them"" is not really a logical rebutal to this because it is one of the aspects in which jbs encourage the style of gameplay we are seeing more and more of.if your argument is that ""i find it fun to shoot posses and lag out all the time... you cant dictate what is fun for me"" then ok... i cant argue against that really, but i doubt the majority of people shooting these posses and sitting through this lag are enjoying it because we hear so much complaining about it. (from the people doing it btw... not from me... because you know... i dont do that. im more the guy that is complaining that other people are complaining and nothing is being done... highfive!)"
11/4/2010,"personally i don't go on pos ops because they do not interest me but i do know how easy it is for a smallish corporation to wreak havoc with a few sc's on a large alliances' infrastructures and they really enjoy that type of gameplay.if i had a sc i would enjoy doing it also, i also get great satisfaction from camping hostile jump bridges and with a small group using the right mechanics you can rack up a hell of a lot of isk damage on jump bridge using alliances very easily.now we come onto your last point, that your alliance enjoys the way they play, well kudos to you, the large space holding alliances also enjoy the way they play as do the sc pilots that can wreak havoc on a large alliance with so few fleet members.what you forget is that so not long ago you were using the tactics that have been described to deny other alliances the use of their jump bridges but hydra decided that it was better to scam their member base than to seriously use the numbers to get results, so you are as guilty as the aforementioned superblobs, you have used the same tactics.jump bridges create excellent pvp potential to all types of pvpers, the alliance that owns them can use them to cut off and pincer a roaming gang, the attackers can rf them and so coral the defenders into a situation of their choosing and campers can get bucketloads of idiots to gank with a bit of pre planning, what is their not to like.your argument about ease of logistics is non sequitur also, it improves the possibilities of supply line destabilisation, when freighter runs were the norm it was extremely hard to break these up unless you had overwhelming force, so point in mute there, you still needed force in numbers, nowadays you get the ruperts jumping into unscouted systems solo, what isn't there to like about that?with a little pre planning you can use an enemies jump bridge network to your advantage, it increases the possibilities of pvp."
11/4/2010,"hrm, so they'd find their own thing to do that they enjoy, and they wouldn't feel the need to demand that the entire game proceed according to their wishes and their views of how things should go? and if they weren't suited to a specific type of warfare, they wouldn't do that and would instead do what suits them, rather than starting a thread in the assembly hall demanding that anybody who can't match larger numbers be helped by ccp so that they don't have to match them?they sound okay. nonsensical rambling, not only without support but hilariously auto-refuting. if coalitions are holding space in order to plant jb's, then that space is being used. again, unable to find a way to make an impact on your own you'd prefer that ccp directly help you by altering the working-as-intended game mechanics that you don't enjoy. to say nothing of the fact that you simply don't get eve. for the love of all that's simple and easy to understand eve is an mmo. eve is an mmo in which a huge swath of territory was designed, specifically, so that groups could claim it and hold it as theirs. faced with the fact that the game is working exactly as it was designed, with emergent behavior dependent on the players' interactions, you'd rather have ccp just alter things so you can play on easy mode. that's. not. eve. you obviously understand neither the concepts of ""logic"" nor a ""rebuttal"". pointing out that it is easy to counter jb's as long as you're semi-competent shows that nothing actually needs to be changed. likewise, whining about jb's is really just yet another one of your backdoor attempts to have ccp help you by altering game mechanics you don't like. there is no functional difference between attacking a jb pos, or a staging pos, or a moon mining pos, etc, etc, etc. your real argument is with the fact that there exist assets in the game that can be defended with more force than you're capable of bringing. that's the game working as intended. if you bring a knife to a gunfight, you end up perforated. just a suggestion, but don't try to sum up others' arguments, you're rather bad at it. to say nothing of how your bizarre emperor of fun routine doesn't make any sense, anyways. flying dozens of jumps manually isn't fun, but there you don't care about that, because you hate jb's. you are, naturally, rather... selective with what type of fun you want to champion. and, go figure, it just so happens to be when that ""fun"" lines up with changes that you've already wanted and while you're looking for rationalizations to support them.i'm sure that's just a coincidence. also not fun: having to wait 60 days for capital ships v, just give it to me right now. having to grind isk to pay for new ships. just give me free ships. having to schlep ships half way across empire to forward staging areas, using freighter run after freighter run to transport dozens of rigged ships. give me jb's in empire. etc, etc, etc. come on emperor of fun, at least be consistent."
11/4/2010,"trying to change the subject, again, coupled with the nonsense and already-rebutted claim that somehow being able to use jump bridges creates big conflicts. you've already had your ignorance cleared up, it's already been explained to you that setting up a forward deployment zone is hardly effected by the dastardly nine jumps of doooooooom. you seem not to be listening.p.s. as always, readers should be sure to check anything and see if it actually says anything even remotely similar to the nonsense that mini is spewing (just like his faked greyscale quote above that he didn't acknowledge but simply kept rolling on). heptameron's lament, in particular, was over sever instability in a conflict that had absolutely nothing to do with the invading force being helped by jump bridges. nothing, at all. it's a totally unrelated point that's simply included so that mini can troll the nc (yet again)."
11/4/2010,"way to miss the point, personally i feel that this topic is in the wrong forum, it should have been in the ideas section and then it would be suitable to be discussing it.i agree with finnagain, you do not seem to be capable to think outside the box to realise that jump bridges actually increase small gang pvp.but then again you are not after that are you, your thinly disguised troll is an attempt to buff your preferred method of km whoring, by using your superior numbers in risk free environments."
11/4/2010,"jumpbridges do save time, but they also do things like allow you to run and manage a much larger coalition of blues with far less trouble. further there is more reason to blue people with established jb networks etc. being able to run massive coalitions with relative ease and safety with more reasons to ""be good friends"" clearly promotes the style of play your fcs/leaders/members are complaining about. and im hardly changing the subject im not going to spend an hour each time you say ""this is just rambling"" telling you its not and why its not when you will just repeat the very next post ""this is just rambling"". so instead i am arguing the core basic points of what i believe in the hope you can actually look at them without saying ""well i dont need to answer this because it doesnt relate to jumpbridges"" my point is about the style of play, and how jumpbridges are one contributing factor. dont get me wrong... there are other things that should be looked at... but i think jbs are a good place to start as i feel they were hardly a necessary addition to begin with.now theres all this talk about how you can effectively camp bridges with small numbers and what not, ill have you know that i am well aware of this and the nc knows about these tactics largely because of my ex-corps(bope) escapades:"
11/4/2010,"erm, no, jb's do not intrinsically allow anybody to manage anything, let alone less trouble, what do you mean by that? i'm not complaining and i'm sure the fc's/leaders/members of the affected alliances are not complaining either, just seems to be you, plenty of smaller alliances like the idea of jb's also, you don't have to be a behemoth alliance to have and use a jb network.now that is rambling..."
11/4/2010,"i dont see how a coalition force being able to use the same instant travel options wouldnt be more managable than having to sort out each alliances options individually. threads i have linked above come from mostly coalitions (most of them from the nc) so i can tell you they are complaining, they just arnt blaming ccp for the right reasons. being their mechanics encourage the game to break. also what i am saying is along the lines of if person x is living far away from empire, or wants to break into 0.0 or something of the sort, there is far more reason to blue and keep blue someone whos travel networks allow you to move faster to where you want to go etc etc. one of the suggestions in this thread was ""yes ok jbs are here... it is unlikely they will be removed... so a way of slightly drawing them back would be to relate their use to the alliance you belong to"" this would maintain a benefit for them even should your alliance not be a behemoth, i mean yes there are unforseen issues such as alliances starting to trade systems to extend their networks and such which can all be looked at in time, but for now i think its important that people start to consider things like this.i hope this answers the questions you raised.but i really must insist that small camps of jumpbridges are hardly devestating to coalitions and do not deter the overall encouragement of the jb system in reinforcing a ""strong coalition system"" in eve."
11/4/2010,"really? the subject was server-side lag in the max campaign? no? go figure. of course, you are impervious to facts as well. you've had it explained to you over, and over, and over why jb's do not do any of the nasty things you've claimed, from making bigger coalitions to, well, whatever other fantasy you've tried to sell. but you keep repeated the same debunked nonsense over and over and over because you can't simply admit you're wrong. total non-sequitor. which is of course your plan as you're trying, yet again, to change the subject. when it's pointed out that of course there are easy ways to counter and/or farm jb's, now it also has to be a way to cut off a significant percentage of jb traffic with a small gank squad on a bridge. i don't think even you believe this nonsense anymore. if it's such a ""crucial"" point one wonders why you deliberately refrain from understanding it. there is nothing inherent in being able to take a bridge that makes for ""larger numbers"". you've had this explained to you time and again. but like i said, facts bounce off you like bullets off of superman. again, facts bounce off you with no effect at all.you don't even realize that you're refuting your own argument as you babble, because you don't care about what makes sense, you're just trying to rationalize a reason for ccp to give you easy mode. if coalitions take space to put up jb's, then they're using that space. how it is that you're unable to understand that ""they're using that to put up a jb network"" doesn't contradict ""they're not using it"" is, well...and of course, large powers have always had tenets/renters/slaves/pets/whatever. the idea that groups only control their sphere of influence now that there are jb's is risible for its sheer ignorance quotient. again, unable to accomplish something with your guns, you want ccp to intervene directly to help you and give you easy mode. your lack of logical insight is truly stunning. all other things being equal, two people will beat one person. four people will beat two people. ten people will beat five people. the idea that alliances won't want to work with other alliances to increase their combat capabilities on offense and defense is... well, it shows the very strange lack of understanding that all of your arguments do. and this is (yet another reason) why you simply do not understand eve. you want ccp to save you, you need ccp to give you easy mode. even if your massive nerf goes through and groups ~gasp!~ adapt and overcome, you'll still want that ""looked at"". because your goal isn't any of the obfuscation you've used to sell it, it's just to hurt anybody bigger than your bunch who's actually able to project force and who you can't counter without ccp's help. alliances cooperating and sharing bridges? nerf bridges. alliances trading space so they can each set up their own jb networks? that has to be looked at so we can see how we can nerf that, too!"
11/4/2010,"a strong coalition in eve terms does not come from having an uber jb network or by any infrastructure.it comes from solid leadership/good fc's and clearly defined goals and direction.removing jb's from game would not affect the oh so human condition of strength in numbers.you are barking up the wrong tree, small gang warfare is becoming vogue again, it is healthy all across eve, space holding under sovereignty is available to all from the largest group to the smallest, just the requisites differ."
11/4/2010,"""all other things being equal, two people will beat one person.four people will beat two people. ten people will beat five people. the idea that alliances won't want to work with other alliances to increase their combat capabilities on offense and defense is... well, it shows the very strange lack of understanding that all of your arguments do.""aside from this you continue to say stuff like ""you just dont understand logic"" without actually saying why those things dont make sense... and if you do provide any reasoning its along the lines of ""its already been debunked"" which is a word you seem to either love using or throw around without much understanding of its meaning.but for the time being i will look at the point i believe you raised.yes there is always insentive to work with other entities, but i think that insentive has gone well beyond the primal ""stick together"" instict. ccp by introducing/implementing things such as jbs/titan bridges has said ""yes we will make it easier for people to work together"" this is the wrong way to go about it i think. if people want to work together that is always going to happen, but i fail to see the need to make it even easier to do if it is the natural thing to do anyway... because while this is a game ccp should be encouraging a more fun model of play, im not saying people wont band together if there arnt so many insentives to do so, but i think fewer people may. further i think if real teretorial greed is reintroduced (eg. some regions worth total bank and other regions will run you into the red) more entitys may be ready to play their hand and see what they draw.now none of this is a ""this will fix eve forever"" type of thing, this is just a lets get things headed in the direction of a fun game rather than where its headed now, where it is encouraged by game mechanics not only by human nature to try cram as many people onto your bluelist as possible.also i think youll find that people do at the very core want to have fun(because at the core of it they do know this is a game), and the only reason they are so insistant on having this many blues is because it is so reinforced by all the game mechanics just how massive an advantage you can recieve if you do get into these supercoalitions. i mean i can ask you a simple question to tell you why it is people will put aside their fun. do you want to lose more often than you do now?just what it comes down to i think.btw i need to say this again it seems: i am not saying ""a jb network is what makes a coalition"" no im saying it makes it stronger and gives more reasons to join/continue to be in a supercoalition."
11/4/2010,"ok i just read on that other jb thread this from you finnagain ""absolutely. it's about time that every jb doesn't require you to re-enter a password.""then as i said there it occured to me that you have spent a lot of time here claiming ""i want easy mode"" i was originaly ignoring this because of how ridiculous it sounds because i really thought it seemed apparent what was easier joining a giant coalition or trying to do something else.but then it occured to me that it is actually an inconsistency with your argument, and a rather big one.you spend half your time saying that jbs dont make a difference / wont make a difference if they are nerfed, and the rest of your time saying i just want easy mode. like there is a pretty basic contradiction there in that should you honestly believe its not a big deal yourself... it wouldnt make this game any easier for me at all... now lets ignore for a second that this change probably wouldnt make this game too much easier for me(because i will likely still not get involved in 0.0 stuff beyond small roams)... and take it is a big part of your longrunning argument in which all i wanted to do was make it easier for me to take your space or something.does it not make a difference? or are you worried things will get harder for you? (which i have long assumed is the reason you are trying to deflect this off as something that will make things easier for other people ""that need saving"").i mean lets face it... if as you say jbs arnt any of what i have said... and you have spent the better part of the thread downplaying them... youve got no worries, i say bring on the change so you can keep winning."
11/4/2010,"un-****ing-real.you just quoted the entire paragraph in which i explained why you don't understand the logic involved and why your formulation ignored basic game mechanics/human nature/math. as trolling goes, this is particularly lame. if you don't understand what words like ""refuted"" or ""debunked"" mean, you can ask. alleging that pointing out all your refuted arguments somehow means that other people don't understand the words is risible. already refuted: if coalitions wanted, they could just trade systems to set up alliance-only jb networks and put their titans in each others' pos's to set up bridging chains too. to say nothing of the fact that this is, yet again, only your subjective opinion with no value other than the novelty of knowing what you think about how groups 'ought' to work together. ah, back to the emperor of fun. and of course, as long as there are objectives worth fighting over, people will gather in numbers to attack and defend them. and as your claims about jb's being novel in any way in that context have all been refuted, you're now at the point in your argument where you simply repeat things that have long since been debunked. as for your nonsense about why your proposal is a troll for you to find a way to hamstring those people who are actually able to work in teams but would still be, functionally, impotent and so it shouldn't be opposed... well, like i keep saying, you draw conclusions like a blind man on meth draws accurate portraits. ""hey, let me paint your bmw tiedye so it goes faster."" ""that's... that the dumbest thing i've ever heard, no. and it wouldn't even make it go faster."" ""well, if it wouldn't have any real effect then why won't you let me do it? that's a pretty big contradiction.""""your mother fed you paint chips as a child, didn't she?"""
11/4/2010,"irrelevant! you dont know logic, game mechanics or human nature!"
11/4/2010,"removing or nerfing jb's will not reduce coalition size, period.why would it?yes it would impact on their gameplay but it would not reduce that alliances member base, why would anyone leave a large alliance just because they have no jb's, where are they going to go, to another alliance with less members with 'shock' no jb's.as i have already mentioned, jb networks have nothing to do with the size of a member base, that comes from other aspects, look at my post above for those reasons, you attract new players to your alliance by making sure you follow those three rules alongside others that are not as determining. andwhich are not mutually exclusive, you have a vested interest, you like small fast roaming gangs and want moar targets for your style of play.transparent much..."
11/4/2010,"people dont want to fly 60 manual jumps to have ""fun"".limit their ability to derive the benefit of being 60 jumps away from ""hostile territory"" while also deriving the ability to get out of those 60 jumps with ease, all the while not having to actually hold anything themselves, and i suspect people will start to fight each other for fun.ive heard the line used when tri was blobbed out of the north a few times ""you were the only game in town"" well two things, if it wasnt about winning and greed would have been pretty smart to leave that only game in town and not blob the **** out of it, but more related to this, its a choice that is becoming easier to make.""the only game in town"" is getting closer and closer because of jbs, stopping people from saying ""hmmmm this is an interesting dilema... there is no one to shoot within 60 jumps because i have everyone set blue... could this be a problem for my memberbase?""ps yes there being more targets in 0.0 is a pretty good thing for pvpers, i dont see why this isnt meant to be transparent? does this mean the limiting of such mechanics would only benefit me?"
11/4/2010,i support changing jump bridges. i also wish the few nc mains and alts who seem to be the few against the idea give it a rest and let some others speak. we all know that your coalition would seriously struggle with jump bridge limitations but please let some others speak. i for one would like to see the upkeep cost of networks increased greatly to the point where when anyone *not* in your alliance using the jb simply makes the upkeep so cost-inefficient that you are forced the find other means of travel and either one of the following: 1. limiting 1 jump bridge per constellation or 2. jb's cannot be anchored 5km outside a pos. make them only anchorable at a celestial.one last thing that i don't like: caps can use a jump bridge to get into a cyno-jammed system.
11/4/2010,"either remove jbs or make it so that anyone with the pw can use them, pretty much if i can't have it nobody can."
11/4/2010,"someone trolling the nc, in a mini thread? what're the odds??? which is exactly how they were designed, so that the defenders would have the advantage and be able to get their capital ships into a cyno jammed system. feature working exactly as intended. but let me guess, if you can't muster a fleet to get in and incap a cyno jammer, then jb's have to be removed ""for fun!"""
11/4/2010,"i support that there needs to be renovations to current jb systems.its wayy to far easy to move stuff around. i dont care on the blue system, but put a better limit on how much/often they can be used.as to it breaking sov, no itll just force alliances to have smaller space, which i believe is a positive as it gets more alliances in nullsec."
11/4/2010,"dear piloteers,i know this is an old discussion, but i personally believe that the wardec mechanic for high sec needs many revisions. nevertheless, as 90% of eve makes it's money by either running high sec missions, plexes, or some other pve stuff then old game mechanics need to be ""updated"" to the current pvp avoidance and rampant pve isk farming of today.therefore, i propose that the wardec mechanics be shifted to a more ""reasonable"" form.1) a corp can now wardec another corp for the standard price, regardless whether either is in an alliance. * the alliance who's corp has a wardec placed against it, can then choose if they wish to honor their alliance and adopt the wardec across the entire alliance. there is no additional cost to either party as a result of this action.* if the wardecing corp is a member of an alliance and has it's war against another corp adopted by that corp's entire alliance, the wardecing corp's alliance can do the same and adopt the war at no additional cost.2) any character that leaves a corp during a wardec may not return to that corp for twice as long as the war remained active. thus if a war lasted 3 weeks, a character that left during that war may not rejoin until 3 weeks after the war is ended.3) any character leaving a corp during a war must also pay a declaration of neutrality fee equal to the cost to fully insure their clone. the player now has a cool down period of one month, where any further declarations of neutrality multiply in cost, in exactly the same way as multiple wardecs. the cool down period being extended after each declaration.the other costs can be left the same or reduced. maybe the multiplier for additional wardecs has a cap on how much a war can cost. somewhere between 3 and 5 times the base cost.the reasons why:a.) cost of war declaration shouldn't be a barrier to empire wars. the cost of war comes from buying and losing war materials, not making a declaration of intent.b.) players are avoiding wars by switching corps, a cost needs to be added to that in both isk and inconvenience.c.) instead of alliances being majorly a nice tactical and social tool to enhance game play and player politics it has in some instances become a means to simply avoid wardecs from smaller corps and paupers due to increased cost, not as it ought to be, the added security of allied corps to fight alongside in the event of war. (and this is true).everything else can remain the same for now."
11/4/2010,"so essentially, you want low cost targets that can't avoid you. no."
11/4/2010,"some guy called frug i think it was, brought up another issue with wardecs over at features and ideas regarding issues for people that like to shoot towers.so an addition to the proposal would be:* corps leaving an alliance at war would now have a 48 hour period where the war continues. (previously 24 hours)"
11/4/2010,"this. wardecs are broken, no one would disagree with you there, but all your suggestion does is multiply what's broken about them, making them even worse than they are now."
11/4/2010,"i like this, but then lets make the standard price 2 trillion isk to make it fairthis is sandbox gamenot pvp in highsec because i have no balls to go to lowsec"
11/4/2010,"lets see. are costs of war in highsec to high? 2 millions against a corp? doesn't looks like it. 50 million against an alliance. also not very much. so from the financial perspectiv it's cheap maybe even too cheap.what happens during highsec wars? most of the time the mighty pvper hunt in wolf packs against lonely targets. if they encounter a force that could be a thread for their precious ships and killboard statistics they start to play docking games. very tactical, very skillful.my guess would be that funding is not the real problem in highsec when it comes to war."
11/4/2010,"i say gambling is a go, but only in lowsec, because the empires outlaw it. it'd be a nice way to boost traffic there also. maybe even extend it to say that gambling can only be done by bartering hauled-in boosters/other illegal goods to make it really illicit and seedy.some kind of unique functionality for player-owned stations would be interesting; perhaps alliance / corp monuments you could build / tear down? and continuing the gambling idea, the ability to run the casino / host tournaments?some way to leave local would be interesting. if you're not in a ship it doesn't make much sense that you'd still need to show up / be talking to people there, does it?maybe a mini-game for running locates, for yourself or others? or mini-games for industry, making building / researching more interesting?"
11/4/2010,"they actually had an arena on singularity for a few days a year or so ago, it was basically whatever ship you're in now vs some ai enemies. but it never worked so they removed it. just thought i'd mention it."
11/4/2010,the only thing i would add to this (and i like all of the suggestions) is minigames. lots of minigames. minigames that don't necessarily require gambling with isk. it would make a good dent in the station-spinning time waiting for skills to train up
11/4/2010,"all good ideas. i'd like to see it open up the underbelly of society, with black-market jobs board and contracts, hidden agents, in-station missions like steal the decryptor, free the slave, assassinate the cfo of a corp and the like. specifically eve is in a unique position to provide in-station content that star wars and star trek cannot, since there are no rules in eve. i guess it will mostly depend on if the devs are just making a lounge for capsuleers, or if they are going to provide a immersive extension of content. if they do opt to create in-station missions i have tons of cool ideas."
11/4/2010,quite simply the ability to see what is outside the station to a radius of 100km so you don't have to partake in silly docking games if it turns out you're being camped!
11/4/2010,"the feature i'd like is for the project to be cancelled so that the enormous amount of our money being wasted on this could be redirected into development of eve online, the spaceship themed mmo.thanks in advance.this is a good example of a feature that definitely should not be in incarna, but absolutely should be in eve.i don't want to have to session change out of the spaceship mode into incarna mode, just to look out of the window, then reload eve-mode and undock."
11/4/2010,"actually, i think it needs to be in both - or at least some generic method that is available in both."
11/4/2010,i would like to see this in incarna:
11/4/2010,"if they incorporate incarna into eve, i'll finally be able to enjoy hunting neuts that appear in 0.0 stations."
11/4/2010,"1) clothing stores2) furniture stores3) upgradeable personal space to include the following:trophy casesshadow boxes (rendered display of decorations/medals)certificate wall4) non-interactive pet habitats (vivarium-style)5) agents that give missions with incarna rewards such as:clothingfurnituretrophiesdecorations/medalspetsideally, availability of the above items will be divided across the universe and require extensive amounts of travel to get them all and include multiple skills to successfully collect. e.g. one must travel to drone space and hunt down a metric crap-ton of drone sites to get a pet drone for display, or travel to amarr prime and do a number of missions to get ""photo of me & empress"" for their trophy case, and all sorts of regional merchandise that is only sold in a specific region/system/station in the wide universe. additionally, i would like to see a method of establishing corporation/alliance exclusive such items in various nullsec regions/systems, so that it becomes impossible to get everything without plying the favor of other players and player organizations and traveling out to their stations as well. edit: if you still have a fashion designer on staff, you can keep them busy making new things for every expansion or so while they work with the wod stuff. that would be great, just like ship updates get rolled out, but without the need to balance it against the meta-game.edit x2: the player's killboard wall, the vanity item to end all vanity items."
11/4/2010,dolls we can dress up.my-little-pony accessories.amen. incarnia might be cool eye-candy to sell at conventions but doesn't help the many things that have been left unattented for too long now.
11/4/2010,"how about some actual gameplay that relates to the spaceships game we all know and love? even though incarna will not run on the same servers as eve in space, it will be stupid if what happens in stations is entirely unrelated to the space game. some ideas off the top of my head: -- hacking public terminals (by solving some kind of cypher-type puzzle, not just a module with a random chance of success as we use in radar sites but something that requires brain power) to discover tidbits of information about the current or immediately adjacent systems related to a corporation or players in space at that moment. might be useful, might not. might have an option to ""dig deeper"", might not. might even give you access to a snapshot of someone's hangar records so you could see what they have in system. anyone walking by could come up and inquire what you're doing, potentially screwing up your progress (assuming the hacks are timed activities).-- bribes to the station manager to delay docking of certain individuals for a short period of time...might need to be based on criteria related to standings or other stuff, not just isk.-- black market trade (only possible via direct handoffs in certain establishments) of special hacked implants or designer-drug boosters which cannot be sold through traditional channels. -- smuggling in-station (one assumes there are station security personnel) of black market stuff carried on your person...where you have a chance of getting busted by random electronic scans when moving illicit goods from one part of a station to another. getting busted would have various penalties associated with it...fines, hold-ups due to interrogation, temporary short-term confinement, etc.-- the ability to put up any item as collateral in games of chance offered in station; you lose, the item is immediately confiscated and placed in the winner's hangar.-- sabotage of industrial facilities, affecting some percentage of currently running jobs...success maybe requiring a series of puzzle solving activities combined with placement of explosives or other disruptive items-- bribing agents to take a day off...oops sorry, no missions from that agent, that day. would have to involve more than just isk though. you might, for example, discover that agents have a penchant for gambling and might invite you to a game of chance just to see if they can take your money for nothing rather than risk their own jobs.now granted, some of these ideas are probably full of holes and even stupid. but i haven't had four years to sit around and think them up."
11/4/2010,i made me do it.
11/4/2010,"it's been proposed here before and i'm proposing it again. give the players the ability, for a fee, to change their character's name. there is absolutely no legitimate reason to disallow such a mechanic. here are some ideas for ccp to implement name-changing:charge $20.00-$30.00 per name change and limit the number of changes to 1 or 2 per year per account. given a conservative average of 500 name changes per month, this would gross ccp $10,000 - $15,000 monthly. to get a more accurate estimate, look at the number of character transfers that occur per month - most of those would have their name changed.increase volume of character transfers due to the ability to change the name. this would, effectively, boost the fees collected for character transfersappease your player base! the vast majority of players in eve are either for the implementation of name changes or indifferent. the cost to implement the code would be low compared to the revenue gained and the appreciation from players.respectfully submitted,afflikshon"
11/4/2010,"i was about to say ""but man it exist already o_o"" when i realized that no, i was thinking about the portrait ^^seein all the others paying services it's strange this one is not available.i suppose they didn't implant the code for it, player name = player id ? so it's a pain to change ?i don't care this thing, but need to know it if someone on our contact (be it red blue or neutral) use it. a simple notification mail would be enough."
11/4/2010,its easy to change your characters name.transfer all isk and assets to a temporary character.press the bio mass button on your main.wait for dt.create new character with a new name.transfer assets and isk back.the cost of course is all the skill points you have ammassed.a fair trade for the anonimity of a new identity me thinks.
11/4/2010,"the following can be inserted pretty much anywhere inbetween what dav said.deal with the consequences of making an idiotic nameanddeal the the consequences of doing naughty things with your characterandthink before you ruin your reputation or create your character's name.i've had my stupid character name for almost 5 years now.if i can handle it, so can you. oh wait... also, there are multiple posts on this subject already.-t'amber"

11/4/2010,my proposal is to adjust some systems next to m-d (?) on the sisi client. i like to experiment around with plexes but finding racial plexes is a pain. my proposal is to upgarde a few systems next to the ffa system that has all the plexes ingame * 5 that insta respawn when completed.
11/4/2010,"in keeping with ccp tradition, the proteus really got screwed compared to it's other t3 counterparts. amazingly, it's the slowest ship of all 4 races, has the weirdest slot layout of all the ships, and is arguably one of the weakest tanks of all the ships.one of the things that baffles me is it's gravitational capacitor sub system. the bonuses reduce warp capacitor cost and increase warp speed. yet even with the boost, it can't even warp faster than a t1 frigate, and why anyone would believe you need a reduced warp cost is amazing. it's a cruiser class ship with an over sized capacitor. it can warp just about anywhere. and longer warps see the capacitor recharge for longer, so that's a non arguement either. so i propose to do one of 2 things to replace this sub system and boost the proteus appropriately. either a: reduce mwd capacitor and boost mwd speed by 3% per level. orb: reduce mass by 5% per level but add 15 base sig.this enables the proteus to get a useful buff that also allows pilots to choose b/t an effective mwd platform, or an effective ab platform. this of course keeps on the track that blaster ships need to be able to close the gap and defend better in their blaster optimal that everyone is preaching."
11/4/2010,yep
11/4/2010,you're arguably one of the dumbest pilots of all the capsuleers.
11/4/2010,"awe, cute, look who's hiding behind his newb corp alt. could you please explain which other t3 has a worse tank when considering all factors including sig, speed, capacitor, hp, and actual rep amt?"
11/4/2010,"all of them. proteus has the second or third biggest buffer cap, behind either the rattlesnake (depending on fit) or damnation.u mad bro?"
11/4/2010,'the proteus really got screwed compared to it's other t3 counterparts'might i introduce you to the legion?
11/4/2010,"umm, besides the loki which gets some other awesome bonuses, the proteus has the 3rd highest buffer once you account for resist just of the t3 ships. of all ships in game, it's not even close to the top unless perhaps you go for some ridiculously nonviable setup. proteus also has to plate to get that buffer, which totally ****'s on it's already bad speed. a mass reduction change for that subsystem would actually help it plate easier. go try an ab or mwd fit on any of the other 3 t3 ships and you will find that they beat the proteus heavily on speed. and all 3 of them have much more significant range. this is the only ship that doesn't get some sort of aid to it's speed in defense of it's other subsystems. and how can anyone argue that the warp bonuses are useful? i'm not so sure why you guys are focusing on the fact that it can get a decent tank. by comparison to any of the other t3 ships, it's totally inferior in terms of speed and total defensive ability. i'm sensing yet again csm forums fail b/c people can read past a first sentence."
11/4/2010,i too think my t3 that has a bs buffer and damage with a long range scram and plated cruiser speed and agility is underpowered please boost it
11/4/2010,"just lol, not supported."
11/4/2010,i lol'd at work. not cool.
11/4/2010,"there are good fits for all the t3s, i think the proteus is probably one of the stronger t3s though, in my own experiance you can get something like 1k/s tank off just one rep. and you can fit two on =s. and lets not even get started on its passive tank.dont think this is the way to go im afraid."
11/4/2010,somehow i agree more with this user than with the op.
11/4/2010,think it's time you find a decent fit for the ship instead of complaining.

11/4/2010,"ok i see many funny sides to this.first i will state my honest opinion: i dont think the tcus should have been removed, because in the past this has been abused and nothing has been done. (this could be because no one has petitioned it of course... but ill get onto that ;p)the second point of view is: on be extended dt someone was saying ""2b is well worth it to get molle to rage"" and well... i think this kind of exploded in tests face because i know not all of them have raged about this... but a lot of people seem to be having a bit of a cry about how unfair it all is...so i would like to thank test for spending isk to troll themselves sorta... its pretty funny.the third point of view is: in the past ccp has flipflopped on decisions like this, and a lot of the times its been against whatever you like to call your big bad molle empire ;p. eg. bubbles being classed an exploit... and i remember a bunch of people clamouring to lol at bob (many of which are people crying about how unfair it is now lol.so im just saying... sure this hasnt been entertaining in the way you planned it to be... but it has been entertaining none the less. thank you."

11/4/2010,"in other words, you have no actual ""counter"" to point out (after arguing for post after post as to how it was almost impossible for you to counter logis before you decided that really you could but it was other people who couldn't), you cannot propose an actual mechanic by which this counter no longer scales, but you can type in all caps. go figure. and then of course you're reminding folks about how you've fabricated several quotes and claimed that other people made them, and pointing out that after you were caught lying and claiming both that it was almost impossible as well as trivially easy for you to counter logis... you've decided to ""bio"" that too. the fact that your quotes were posted is relevant as you you posted (at least) one obvious lie out of two wildly contradictory statements. yes, you then went on to try to claim that you hadn't said what you said, but you meant somethign totally different that just happened to be what you didn't actually say. and you still haven't addressed which time you were lying, and why you felt the need to lie. the funny thing, amidst your epic-all-caps-freakout-text is that you didn't feel the need to ""clarify"" anything for post after post while you were arguing either the lie that it's almost impossible to counter logis or the lie that it's trivially easy and you've been doing it for years (for post after post while you were trolling people), but as soon as it was pointed out that both can't be true and one had to be a lie, all of a sudden then you felt the need to 'clarify'. and when called on that clarification, you babble about drakes and vagas and not the counter to logis that (you swear!) is easy and simple and you've been using for years but nobody else can cuz of how 1337 your are. even funnier in your epic-all-caps-freakout-text is that you're lying and claiming that anybody else is trying to claim what it is you said when, after your, your quotes have been posted. and you are trying to deny, spin, or ignore them. when your own words are in a conspiracy against you and someone posting what you yourself have said is somehow ""deciding what you said, and not you"", well... it's time to stop the nonsense and just address which of your claims was a lie, and why you were lying. most likely, however, they were probably both lies to a certain degree. the first, that it was nearly impossible to counter logis in the present, not in some mythic 'post-scalable-counter' future that you later lied and said you were talking about, was both to bolster the claim that logis need to be possibly removed from the game and that you're awesome but that your enemies suck and aren't as cool as you. along the same lines, your later lie about how it's trivially easy for you to counter logis (after you were arguing for most of the thread that no such thing was true) was because you wanted to present yourself as 1337 some more and get the good ol' epeen going while you were alleging that all the people who'd been trying to educate you on how to deal with logis while you were arguing for why you couldn't possible? well, they were the ones who couldn't deal with them, not you, because you're awesome. which is to say, much more likely than not you can't identify only one quote which is a lie, and identify why you were lying about it, because both contain dishonesty and were used for the purpose of your regaling everybody with how awesome you are and how not-awesome everybody else is. speaking of you lying: the fact that you find it hard to fly one logi ship in a big logi gang reflects on let me finish that sentence for you, shall i?... reflects on the fact that mini is lying, again, and there is no such ""fact"" because mini made is up and is a liar, and nobody ever said that anybody found it hard to fly a logi ship in any gang, big or small, but a lie serves mini's purpose far better than an honest discussion of the issue. glad i could help."
11/4/2010,"im not going to give you counters you havnt thought of... if you are bad at this game its not my problem.in fact i think you have mentioned almost every ""counter"" in this thread except the ones that work (somewhat) against good logi gangs. so go back and by deduction work out what they are for yourself."
11/4/2010,"thought so, you're just trolling.you spent half the thread trolling by arguing that there are no counters and you can't counter logi gangs and ccp needs to alter the game mechanics to save you. then you spent the other half trolling that you have lots of easy counters that totally work, you just can't say what any of them are. and, naturally, if you do have easy counters that work then the very premise of your own thread is refuted. but naturally the super seeekrit counters (that really exist, honest!) that you just can't tell anybody also have some sort of undefined, unspecified mechanics (that really exist, honest!) that prevent scaling. and you argument, no matter what lie you use, that it's almost impossible to counter logis or it's super easy, ends up being used for you to claim that you're 1337 and everybody else is ""bad"". you've gone as far as to lie, hilariously, that while many people have tried to explain to you how to deal with logis, both from the perspective of flying logis extensively and flying against logis extensively, that it was really other people who were saying that they were unable to deal with logis but that you knew how. what luck, the counters that you claim you know are secret and you can't tell anybody. but that proves how leet you are and how bad everybody else is. your claim that you couldn't counter logis even while everybody else was trying to tell you how you could, that too just showed how leet you are and how bad they are. it's almost like no matter what position you invent, no matter which of your own statements you have to contradict with obvious dishonesty, the argument is always about how awesome you are and how bad anybody is who disagrees with you. almost like it's deliberately set up to troll people. and by almost, i mean exactly."
11/4/2010,mmmm good point youve totaly convinsed me that logi gangs of 50+ vs logi gangs of 50+ will be lots of fun. excellent job.

11/4/2010,csm are discussing this with ccp. nothing to report yet.
11/4/2010,it does seem like a double standard for players. some alliances are allowed to do this while others are not.
11/4/2010,"this is all based on the assumption of point 1 being true1) anything that happens over a regular dt is allowed2) tcu / sbu: this is where my idea is unfounded until now i guess. iirc you are not able to wardec anyone before an extended dt as they count doing that to rundown the warmup timer as an exploit as it denies the opponent the chance to become prepared. i assume ccp is following the same thing here. test did not allow it the chance to fight back. the reason that test got their stuff moved and the others didn't is because until now people may not have gamed the extended dt and had their stuff petitioned. ccp looked at it and said its a valid argument and removed test's then when they cried ccp went and took out other tcu/sbus (these probabally were petitioned too after exact precident was set)3) stations: petition away, ccp will tell you to run away. stations work by you putting the station up, throwing all the crap in and clicking build. if you were to press the build button at 2 seconds after dt you get to wait til the next dt, if you press it 2 seconds before dt in two seconds your station egg is going to morph. this is due to the fact that one of the scripts that runs at any dt has its sole purpose of looking for any itemid's registered to eggs and morph them into a station4) pos's you can anchor these and start their online timer during a standard dt and have it come out done. so doing this during an extended dt does not matter other then you anchor guns at a time different then before. having them come out of ref during a sov timer is valid too iirc. granted it may not be valid to time them to come out at the very beginning of a 15 hour dt as i am not sure if that is enough time for the tower to passively rep its shields back over fifty from twentyfive. then again this crime could be committed by having the tower set to whatever the dt is going to start at (in this case 500 game time) and your plan is to never even bother during the fight to reinforce so you wouldnt be penilized for passively exploiting due to when you got attacked."

11/5/2010,noi don't mind cosmetic.i don't mind cool modules.as long as they are expendable it doesnt matter. your character's skill points are pretty much forever though.in essence the selling of remaps is the selling of skill points.one of the things about the sandbox and hostility of eve that made it fun was that it felt fair in its own skewed way. being able to buy skill points makes this less interesting since it makes one feel like they have to sink more real money into the game to stay competitive. will not renew my subscription either when this goes through.

11/5/2010,"too much of eve is generic, exploring space just isnt as exciting as it could be if the same models were not used over and over again."
11/5/2010,"there was another thread asking for the same thing a while back, and i believe the op in that post showed that ccp already has unique station models for pirates which aren't being used in the game. it'd be nice to see them pop up."
11/5/2010,"/signedas much as the workload would increase for this, augmenting current station would also be a good thing, and by augmenting i mean the physical models not just the paintwork."
11/5/2010,"yes to eye-candy. considering the amount of work involved however, it shouldn't be a priority right now. as a workaround, ccp may want to consider more art contests like the one on da recently, but for specific, not generic ships. many of the submissions to the contest were epic, and if the incentive is ""if i win, my model is gonna be the new bhaalgorn!"" rather than ""my ships is gonna be some random thing implemented at some point in the future and probably with the utility of a zephyr"", i'm quite certain more people will put larger amounts of work into it.e:typo"
11/5/2010,yikes... i wouldnt touch on the eve da contest... that was quite a can of worms in the end.. a lot of unhappy people.. tho i did very much like the winning ship... bt art contests would be awesome! im sure theres quite a few eve enthusiasts that are capable 3d artists (plus ive a few i didnt submit) n get it judged by the eve community this time rather than a non associated pannel of deviant art peeps.
11/5/2010,"should have clarified that - art contests, but not with da. that was fail.da or a similar outfit wouldnt be needed to advertise something like this - the eve community and mouth-to-mouth propaganda would be all thats necessary for this to spawn whats needed - a shiny new model and valuable addition to the game with less effort for ccp and, if selected by the community, less chance of getting reactions along the lines of ""eww""."

11/5/2010,"in news today, you don't know what top teir means. that is the maller.max skill so it should take more skill to fit then a harbinger or zealot, let alone the very fitting friendly stabber and vexor...hull cost is close the same because is in the same teir as the arby, guess you missed that.everyone already flys arbies which is the issue. the omen is close to a dead ship in pvp because of fitting issues and a buff would be acceptable. next time read up on the ship before making failed opinions."
11/5/2010,"the description for the omen says ""the omen is a stereotypical example of the amarrian school of thinking when it comes to ship design: thick armor and hard hitting lasers.""it has to be able to fit thick armour and hard hitting lasers. and not the abominations that are quad light beams.similar size or cost ships have more hp, more firepower, and are easier to fit as well.""meh, skip laserboats till harbinger"" is no good for the game.""meh, crosstrain x race instead"" is no good for the game.what eve needs is for all ships to be useful. when there are ships which are more useful to build t2 ships with than to fly in their own right, then that's no good."
11/5/2010,"rsa ftw, passwords are totally yesterday"
11/5/2010,"updated with a few more examples and refining the ideaproblem:i want to invent (or manufacture) using ten blueprint copies. i need to select ten unique instances of options for input/output hangers, decryptors, desired results, industry slots, etc. this is time consuming, requires an abundance of queries to the servers, and is highly repetitive.solution:select all the blueprints in question at once and choose to invent (or manufacture etc). select options a single time that will be used for all blueprint jobs (input/output hangers, decryptors, etc). select a bank of industry slots to use using shift-click methods. confirm the last screen which is updated with materials required for all jobs as a whole. each blueprint (and therefore each industry slot) will still count as one job skill-wise, and will not allow an artificially high amount of industry jobs to be in progress. think grouping turrets in combat. why not treat industry jobs similarly?pros:industry as whole will become slightly less frustrating. competition may increase due to more players running more jobs.cons:newly available npc industry slots could be snagged many at a time by a single player, instead of being filled one at a time by multiple players. this situation does not yet exist because industry slots are currently available one at a time, as jobs can only be started one at a time.(the public industry slots can be protected from this by limiting the new feature to pos-only slots, though it would not help the thousands of industrialists that rely on npc slots. or, could place a limit on the number of slots you can batch-start based on how many are available at a given station)optional thoughts:-allow an option to run a job with particular settings and auto-repeat that job until some condition is met (run out of materials, no available slots, repeat x number of times, etc). public slots will be auto-repeated after a short break (a few hours?), to allow other players a chance to move in and use the empty slot. think autopilot for industry slots. it's convenient, and there is a penalty for using it (lost time between jobs), but you can escape the click-fest."
11/5/2010,from your lips...gets suggested in here at least once a month. current system is egregiously ****ty and the ui requires 8 clicks and 3 dialog windows to start 1 ****ing job. the ui designer who came up with it should be dragged out into the street and shot.will be nice when ccp is done making wod and dust and can get back to this game and make changes like this.

11/5/2010,"um i'm a toon with less than 48 hours of training, and i fly in a thrasher (destroyer, btw) and i can be in a drake and still have less than 900k sp, which is what, a week of training? pretty sure you can be in something other than a frigate much sooner than two months - and sprinkle in learning skills as you want/need.select a ""group"" of skills to train with matching primary/secondary attributes (i.e. gunnery or spaceship command skills)train the matching l1 learning skills to 2/3, remap the attributes to boost.train skills.rinse, repeat for other skills and 2nd remap (available to all new players/characters).don't bother training charisma skills at all, and save yourself the hassle unless you are a mission alt/pi alt.don't train tier 2 learning skills past iv, if you train them at all.the complaint ""omfg if i don't train all the learning skills to v then it will take me 370 days (instead of 300) to fly a carrier"" is a shallow argument."
11/5/2010,"dunno bout u guys bt i remember in education going through and learning about the techniques of learning and how your brain facilitates thoughts into short term and long term memory, along with practical ways of being able to learn more, faster and with better recall... but then again if its good enough for real life i guess its not good enough for ccp. failzorz!"
11/5/2010,try and fly that drake into a level 3 mission with only 900 k sp.i dare you.
11/5/2010,"not the point - the point being it's much more than a frigate, in much less than 2 months. what is level 3 mission, anyway? is that a pvp corp?"
11/5/2010,that's the point i was trying to get across. *gives menacemyth imaginary kudos*
11/5/2010,"finally a good suggestion, even if said before ( i think it was)100mil is nothing for a week of war, its easily possible to permanently wardec a corp as it stands now with basically no issue,2mil a week , even i can afford to wardec for months/years. 100mil will make wars what they should be wars. not zomg lets lolkill this corp for a week. of course the ""propvp"" corps are *****ing, but its what is expected.eve needs and isk sink, this is the easiest one and would be a very fast one to implement. 2million isk? come on 1 lvl 4 mission and u can dec for a month, actually, more then that."
11/5/2010,"can't have this...2.75 billion is the cost of 3 tech 2 fit carriers and for what they do that is plenty money(10 wars is not a good enviroment to grind on a weekly basis and afford the ships to fight). i guess it would be better if we remove the stacking system and have it at a higher flat rate.that way corps mercenary corps can actually afford to run multible wars, but the first one isn't ******edly cheap. might actually be a buff to people dedicated to wars.just a thought..."
11/5/2010,"could always have zones, i put that idea forth like 6 months ago0.0 wars freelowsec cheaperhighsec more expensiveyou could even divide highsec into .5~.7 and .8+ or somthing"
11/5/2010,supported.
11/5/2010,this is the best ideal for high sec war decs. it even makes common cents. if the cops can be payed off to not do there job they can probly be payed off to do there jobs as well.
11/5/2010,agreed.
11/5/2010,"you mean griefing should be cheap. pvp is always cheap, go out to low sec/nullsec or have a mutual wardec (or trick someone and **** them off into wardecing your corp/alliance). wardecs will still be cheap, even if there is an increase in costs, just that a person has to actuallly *gasp* consider who they wardec. fighting is cheap. war is expensive."
11/5/2010,"since the bid system has been mentioned, i guess i need to decide whether or not i support it. frankly, i do not support a bid system for a variety of reasons. i will list them below.a.) the bid system is a new ""module"" that would need to be tested and incorporated into eve. that would bring much more overhead, many more months of bug testing, and there really needs to be more people dedicated to other things. with my fix, its a few lines of code change. with a bid war, it requires opening a new set of databases, more error checking, and a whole new set of rules and logic. yes, its simple from a person who does not code for a living... but i rather see the lag problems fixed than to burden ccp with a bid war set up. there are already enough problems in eve than to keep adding ""more crap"" ontop of each other. (not saying the bid system is crap, but its just that there is more of a chance that bad things will go terribly wrong if you continue to add more things to eve).b.)it will be broken and abused. for instance, small corporations who can not afford the bid system get overrunned by griefers. bigger corporations have more isk to toss away at smaller griefers. yes, it creates a isk sink, but not an effective one.c.) another big issue - say corp a wardecs corp b. corp a pays 2 million to start the bid, and corp b pays 2.00001 mil the next day. does this mean that the bid system will continue for 24 hours before the war bid will be cancelled? how much of a cool off until corp a can wardec again? even if you limit the window for the bid system to last 24 hours, there are a few people who have a life outside eve who can probably not make it in that kind of window and then their votes in the corp are shoved aside. much more coding, much more bickering, too much of a pain in the ass for ccp to even consider this option right now. towards the rr corps issue...simple fix is to hire a merc corp to do the same thing. even i have to admit that hiring a merc corp is sometimes the best option to alleviate the strain of a wardec. nothing says ""**** you"" like a stream of 30 kestrels against 7 wardecing hacs. if the rrers are still a pain, switch to neuting and using cloak ships to allow ""warp on zero"" tactics. its going to cost the offending corp more isk if you use a dominix to neut a dedicated logistics ship even if the dominix goes pop. always have a ""higher- up"" friend in a merc corp you can talk to on a normal first-name basis. do a few roams with them, learn some tactics. if your miner/high sec corp gets wardecd, i am sure you can afford to spend 100-300 million towards your friendly merc corp who will love to cause the station camping to be in your favor.still, they can escalate...nevertheless, rr can be used both ways. its... fair. anyone in ccp can agree with that."
11/5/2010,"war decs can be loads of fun, but i must agree the fee is too low. an established corp will have no problems with an increased fee. personally, i think something should be done with the neutral rr game mechanic."
11/5/2010,"i think there is something wrong with the game mechanic. everytime i get decc'ed, i wake up with a sore anus."
11/5/2010,"i think 300 mil for a corp dec and 600 mil for a alliance dec is about right. declarations of war are a serious ting and should reflect that seriousness in their price. right now, decs are being used 85% of the time as a means to pvp non-pvp interested targets in high sec or simply as a griefing tool by those who get a chuckle out of seeing newbie corps squirm and disband. the fact is that ccp designed these particular regions for a reason. high sec is for youngins to learn the game and for casual gamers to roam more securely. low sec is for pvp'rs, pirate activities, risk for reward and general butthurt. nullsec is for those corps who want to run things their way and god help you if you get in the way. cheap and easy war decs have led to what is an ever growing epidimic of grief deccing by experienced pvp corps looking for a good time at the expense of corps who don't even know what they're doing yet. i'm not saying it should be made illegal by any means, nor am i saying that high sec should be overtly safe. what i'm saying is that it needs to be expensive enough that you better damned well mean it or else it becomes nothing more than paying next to nothing to shoot ducks in a barrel.to put it in different terms, you wouldn't want mike tyson to be able to walk into a local boxing gym and pay the manager 2 bucks to run around knocking out all the amatuers before they even learn how to throw a proper punch.he should pay 300 bucks, lol."
11/5/2010,"eve and i-war are completely different beasts - the comparison falls down on many levels.i-war is entirely single player and has full control over how much calculations need to be made at any given time. eve is single-shard multiplayer where the amount of small (easily run on a 400mhz cpu since 2001) calculations is an unknown because it depends on how many players are in one place at a time.it's also not just about the number crunching, but the gameplay too - how much would it take a player to navigate around celestial objects and how much benefit will it give to the game experience. tbqh i would see this as similar (in terms of gameplay enjoyment, naturally it would work differently) to having to scan down each gate in the system before being able to warp to it... yawn!"
11/5/2010,make large colidable objects invisible while warping / thread
11/5/2010,two facts:1) they chose to waist resorces on re-making all the models and effects in the game.2) they chose to waist resorces developing a purly cosmetic out of pod experiance without any functionality beyond a chat room.one point:if development resorces are so limited they dont even need to have our ships go arround objects they could just impose some kind of funky distotion effect when we pass through things. as things are now it just looks crude and unpolished.
11/5/2010,"you want something to compare the eve development to that has credable ties? ok!look at pioneer space sim and tell me thats closer to eve than i-war? bear in mind pioneer is an open source graphical update on david brabens elite... a game that even ccp have said eve online distinctly evolved from! ohh and theyve solved the warp round planets thing too. dont say it cant be done or shun it cause its not got a suitable comparison... the closest comparisons have been made, and each time this particular issue has been solved, even by amateurs!plus if eve truely is an evolution of elite and therefore pioneer, which ccp say it is, the code is there to implement already! its open source!ohh and 1 other thing.. if you actually read the thread and not the last 2 comments ud have realised i have been talking all along about avoiding celestial bodies only and not every tiny little item in each star system!"
11/5/2010,"yeah... sure... that would effectively remove poses from those moons because they will keep getting damage.as for the general idea, do you really feel that general gaming experience for all players will benefit from this in the amount that could be justified by development time needed to make this? i think not.not supported."
11/5/2010,"i guess u only put ur pos's onto moons with very low orbits around gas planets... jesus how picky are you! even so i do believe the general gaming experience will benefit players in the end. im going to make an analogy that will help u see it more clearly. eve online right now is the space sim equivalent of an fps shooter having a flat arena with no walls or objects in to block either your path or your shots. just safe areas u can run into where u cant be hurt and the ability to change how fast u run, how much damage u can take and how powerfull ur guns are. if an fps game came out like that itd be shunned by the likes of everyone unless it had some severe distractions and minigames along the way. i know the combat system in eve is chance based rather than dynamic hit detection based bt if u truely can say ud be happy bout playing in a fps game like that, ur better at dealing with a bad compromise than me. this specific change adds dynamicism and new oppertunities for risk vs reward which seems to be ccp's motto, as well as adding a new level of tactics and random occurances to pve as well as pvp. it would influence tactics on scouting and recon duties against corps and alliances in hisec and null sec, offer sanctury to people who've planned ahead, and the ability to plan traps based on actually knowing an area of space that you traverse rather than abusing broken game elements for a tactical advantage.but i guess if u wanna stick to what u know, dont like embracing change for the better, because it screws with you comfortable little world then ur not really going to embrace rl properly, let alone a space and social interation simulation./rant"
11/5/2010,"you know, if this was caod i'd fully agree (imo the no-alt posting rule there is definitely right)... you got it backwards. i'm not talking of what image my posts would project onto my alliance, but what stigma my alliance projects onto my proposal. people do have their stereotyped thinking, even if unconsciously, and i won't claim i manage to be bias free, but i try. for instance, imagine you saw a proposal by a goon...and if you are righteous like you claim you should consider the proposal implications for all parties , who would be buffed/nerfed by it and if somebody might in fact be pushing some unilateral agenda, regardless of the proposal op.a) feel free to check my posting and proposal historyb) its funny because most bad proposals are done by alliance members or well known characters, not some unknown alt.i'm gonna go ahead and call troll, because discussing alt posting in a ban-alt-posting-thread is very much on topic. we can agree that improving ah is a thing that should be pursued, but you want to inhibit discussion on why the proposal at hand is not the solution were looking for, trying to impede what is ultimately a democratic process.so who's the one more interested in pointing fingers instead of improving the game after all?"
11/5/2010,"and if it wasn't caod, it wouldn't be any less important, despite what u alone favor.1. the direction of the ""stigma"" is irrelevant--they affect each other the same way. u ****-post, u make your affiliation look bad. your corp/alliance mate ****-posts, they make u look bad. but if u're that obsessive over e-image because u think your affiliation makes or breaks your stance (it doesn't), then u might wanna leave your corp/alliance if u don't even want to associate with them. simple as that.2. so if u can make a good stance, regardless of affiliation, it's a good stance. however, if u're gonna ****-post by giving no good reasons and ignoring the opposition, then it's not valid. when that happens, one would take a look at your affiliation and then it boils down to ""buff me and nerf them because i said so"".3. u're not really trying at all to be bias-free if u're gonna comment on another corp/alliance's proposals right after. in other words, u totally ignored almost all of this thread...again...when all that would be nerfed r the trolls who resort to hiding behind another identity. of course, caught up in your own hypocrisy and self-righteousness, u're incapable of noticing that. so when u mention this unilateral agenda, r u talking about your idea to only apply this to your precious caod and not anywhere else? u're not special so why don't u take your own advice? because so far, all u have left is to complain about how it would affect u and your e-image only, which isn't saying much... a. u still don't get it...figures... no matter what u do in your self-righteousness, u're not gonna absolve all the other ****-poster alts. u're not special--get over it.b. and who's supporting them with trolling comments? their own alts. it's real funny how u somehow failed to notice that.1. only your discussion just proved our point.2. wow...just...wow... and u're calling me a troll? again, no one said u couldn't post at all. only your own side said that. good job on missing that completely for the millionth time, moron. u already answered your own question with your self-defeating attempts i mentioned. i was merely making note of that. not to mention, only thinking of yourself and disregarding everyone else sure as hell isn't gonna improve the game. in case u still haven't figured it out...u're not special. so try to get some perspective and some words of advice: check yourself before u knock on someone else. next."
11/5/2010,i'll bump this since i'd like some input.
11/5/2010,"itt nc finds it too ""annoying"" to tpye passwords for various jbs that let them travel practically anywhere in the top hemisphere of the eve universe.instant conclusion everyone else wants easy mode! carry on brave nc!"
11/5/2010,"it's not just the nc that has massive networks of jump bridges. they exist through the drones as well as delve/querious.you seem to single out the nc for everything based on your own political affiliation. i'll agree with you that with the current situation of server node lag the tendency to very large fleet battles is bit conflicting. those battles could be awesome, were the server able to handle them anywhere close to playable, and were there viable options for meaningful smaller conflict.folks are going to find a way to work together in these big coalitions, that's always going to be a tendency that you're not going put a stop too with some game mechanic changes. it's possible to influence or encourage the opposite, but it's difficult to do so without placing arbitrary restrictions or inequities (which ccp wishes to avoid).i think there are many other things ccp could do to revise dominion sov that could help a lot more than some restrictions to bridges, i don't think we should completely discount some changes to bridges, but they aren't the fix all solution you make them out to be. what do you think of the idea's here..."
11/5/2010,"mini's love of trolling aside, there is no good reason that bridges can't be set for standings rather than requiring the annoyance of retyping passwords for each bridge."
11/5/2010,"while we are at it, we should also make it so that you dont need a cyno to jump places, lets face it... its too annoying to have to put a cyno where you want to go...lets make it so that you can just jump to wherever you want!this game is way too tedious with all these severe restrictions to travel."
11/5/2010,"sarcasm doesn't work well in text my friend, well maybe for you it would if you adopted a different color to indicate sarcasm, but i digress...if you couldn't make it out from my post i was trying to agree with you on your concern for fleet warfare and perhaps get your thoughts on some of my idea's. but it looks from your response that you're more interested in trolling."
11/5/2010,"it's interesting, and hard to tell. does mini troll constantly, or are his logical skills simply nonexistent? he likes to feign stupidity/mental damage in order to troll people, i think. i waver back and forth in my judgment. maybe he really does believe that not having to enter a password for every bridge, saving someone literally .3 seconds to a whole two seconds, is somehow analogous to being able to use jump drives without requiring a cyno and having limitless range for those drives. but probably he's just trolling. in any case, the 2/3 of the op's points are solid. pointless restrictions like requiring someone to enter a pw each bridge or not being able to take fuel from authorized users is simply a set of annoyances set up for no real reason; it's adding gnats to the picnic because some developer thought that the gnat quotient wasn't high enough. but effectively allowing the equivalent of using jump drives while pointed/bubbled is a bad, bad idea. still, 2 out of 3 aint bad."
11/5/2010,"i wasnt talking about or to you. im just laughing at that finnagain guy who spent the better part of the last week telling me that this game shouldnt be changed because ""you want easy mode""i also have another suggestion btw, maybe we should make it so that you can autopilot a fight also! so that you dont need to fire your guns or lock targets... the game should detect ships that are being primaried and just shoot them with the right ammo.its too annoying to do those things manually."
11/5/2010,"as it says.i propose adding a column to the ui that specifies the signature radius of all potential targets. it goes without saying that changes to signature caused by target painters, micro warp drives and other modules and rigs (e.g. shield extenders) should be dynamically accounted for.i feel no need at this point to specify why this would be an improvement but reserve the right to do so at a later date should it be needed."
11/5/2010,"definitely, if there is traversal there should also be sig radius."
11/5/2010,yup
11/5/2010,"this would be a nice feature. as a pre-emptive strike against those who might claim that there is already a size column available in the overview: that column does not show signature radius, it shows a standardized value base on ship class.afaik this information is not currently sent to the client; therefore adding this feature might cause lag, especially in large fleet battles where there are alot of ship. in those large fleet battles, their might be a lag spike if there is a change in fleet boosting effects that changes the signature radius of many ships at once.if this can be made to work then great, but i doubt it would be acceptable if it caused the lag monster to return."

11/5/2010,yeah but it means local isn't the perfect intel tool as ccp intended.
11/5/2010,"you don't need incarna for any of that - all incarna can do that eve cannot is rp dress up toys made possible because you can look at your avatar in 3d and mechanics related to physical location - but short of adding avatar combat i'm not sure what gameplay elements could be improved by that.i don't give a crap what pointless dress up elements ccp choose to add, but the last thing i want to see is meaningful station functionality which i have to pointlessly walk across an irrelevant station to reach, when it could easily be added to the station dock menu. this goes for suggestions like gambling, stores, black markets, map rooms etc, just as much as for public terminals, recruitment, station windows and so on.eve does not need more trivial timesinks forcing me to slog around an irrelevant station map to access eve mechanics."
11/5/2010,i like mynxees idea of finding people to bribe. probably find these folks in low sec. say you want to transport boosters from point a to point b. if you could meet someone they might say pay me this much and you can go this specific route safely for the next 72 hours or whatever. now there could be a skill of bribing. and/or it could be based on your standings with the faction who owns the space you are going through. and/or the corp you are dealing with. maybe if you have a high standing with the faction you are better at detecting if the briber is really going to bust you. this would be explained that with factions that you have high standings with you have connections. so if the potential person you are going to bribe were to tell you you can get past someone you know is honest you would know not to take the bribe. this would be automatically detected in the background you would just be told something like you have a bad feeling about this plan or conversely this seems like a good deal and then have the option to accept or reject the plan.maybe there could be some high sec equivalents too. maybe you could see someone who you could pay a bit more to get some added concord protection for a certain route. if someone tries to suicide gank you on the trip concord response times could be lowered. whether others (suicide gankers) could pay off someone to be made aware of these deals or not is something that could be considered.you may have to stop in to stations to see what the demand for certain consumer items are. that might change based on the news. maybe a scare about quafe potentially causing an illness will reduce its demand or some health benefit would increase its demand. so if you had connections with the company you may be able to find this sort of thing out before the news hits and stock up or sell off.whatever it is i think the amount of information you can get will depend on your corporate or faction standings. perhaps you will get better information/bribes from minmatar if your amarr standings are very low as well. so there can be definite trade offs to the standings game. maybe different corps who compete will also give better intel if your standings are low with their competitors.
11/5/2010,"whatever people who have been playing eve for a while think, most people new to the game think its odd that you only ever see your avatar. having a body should definitely add to the immersion. its the same thing with why they make models for spaceships instead of all of them being just white spheres of various sizes labeled ""merlin"" or ""tempest"" depending on what they are. the mechanics would all be the same but the immersion would suffer. but anyway back on topic: here are some random ideas that i havent really thought through very well and probably wont work:another idea (probably a bad one) that would be a really big change from the current system but might be very good for the whole spying thing would be if you could pay someone to tap into chats. local chats would be easy to get even if you are not in that system. private chats and eve mail a bit harder and fleet chats would be even harder. the only way someone could really talk in private *in game* would be if they were literally face to face in the same room and had a device that scrambled any bugs that might be on the other person. the advantage here would be there would be a way of detecting spies similar to real life. seeing someone meet with your enemy allot would then be a tip off just like in real life. plus if you used these taps there might be ways others could detect this. add tools that would make allot of the intel aspects happen in game instead of out of game. of course third party methods of communications would be a straightforward work around such as vent or e-mail. so the idea may be a complete bust. but it would be awesome if we could get the spying dynamic which is now solely a meta game into the actual game. of course the concern would be that this sort of thing would just force everyone to no longer use the in game communications. the other problem may be that your scouts would end up sitting in a station instead of actually flying around scouting. which isnt really fun. maybe you could at least bribe someone to find out who someone is in fleet with. there would be no easy workaround here. if you want to warp to fleet member you have to be in the same fleet.i really dont know whether any of these later ideas could work because of third party workarounds. but it would be great if it could work. it would truly be that sci fi universe we all would love to see."
11/5/2010,she ^^ made me do it.
11/5/2010,"thiswould benefit scammers, corp-theifs, and the like. would not benefit honest or average players in the least, aside changing from a name they no longer like (which is easily remedied through character transactions right now). there are consequences to every action in eve, this is one of it's best traits. you can mastermind the greatest heist in history, though your toon's name will be tarnished as a result. make it worthwhile. there aint no such thing as a free lunch."
11/5/2010,"op, you really haven't found anything else to troll about, have you?"
11/5/2010,absurdly terrible idea. die in a fire.
11/5/2010,i can't support this. i understand your feels but they payed to play and train up to fly thoughs ships. i would not want to pay more then other people just to fly my bs's. it's just not a good ideal. i dont even fly caps and i would stop playing eve if they started charging more mony to fly differnt kinds of ships.
11/5/2010,moved from the assembly hall
11/5/2010,perhaps you can discuss with ccp the matter of the treatment of veteran players and how they should listen to us more often?
11/5/2010,give the bug hunters the ability to teleport on tq? if theres people floating around invisible for a while get one of them to poof over to that area and look. it would give ccp word from someone they semi trust more then random player with photoshop.
11/5/2010,well you would certainly see an explosion in apps. to be a bh
11/5/2010,add covert ops cloak and a buff please. btw they also need more fitting help. sin needs more grid for sure.thanks
11/5/2010,"why so serious? for real though, this is a game dude, not like resigning (lol!) from congress or....a job."
11/5/2010,"simple way to improve low sec is get rid of gate camps. i would live in low sec if it weren't for lolgatecamps. buff the sentry guns, tinker with session changes/ cloak/ invulnerability mechanics, whatever. gate camps are bad. only bad players camp gates. get rid of gate camps and more people will use low sec."
11/5/2010,"forcing isn't quite in the spirit of a sandbox game.however ... if going through lowsec would allow players to shave a couple of jumps off commonly used routes, there would be an incentive to go to lowsec without anyone actually being forced to do so.also, beefing up the rewards for doing stuff in lowsec would help. right now, there's hardly any difference between mission rewards in a 0.5 and a 0.4 system, while there is a huge difference in the risk involved."
11/6/2010,absolutely supported.
11/6/2010,cosmetic only!character portrait...etc.
11/6/2010,yes- cosmetic only.
11/6/2010,no
11/6/2010,noi have stopped playing many a mmo for microscrewing my wallet!
11/6/2010,6 months doesn't really seem like enough time to create and launch a full expansion. i'd be willing to settle for one expansion a year if the expansion we got was well built and interesting. and i'd definitely like to see them revisit existing content before charging ahead with more new content.
11/6/2010,man tbh it is absolutely the reversal....jag is the munin's light version.wolf is the vaga's light version.4th bonus is ok.mixed bull****s like sacriledge strange bonuses not.edit: 100% supported topic
11/6/2010,"let me just say how fantastic i think the communication to the community is now. all these dev blogs mentioning the csm, wiki is updated, mailing list, sticky post, we even get to know details about ccp's development queue - that's intimate. keep up the good work !"
11/6/2010,yes to this - rsa ftw.. tho its definitely not infallable. bt only if u browse the most dodgy sites on the net totally unprotected.
11/6/2010,this enables secure account sharing. this will allow someone to lend out their account with no threat of it being stolen.if it does not then it is worthless.
11/6/2010,#NAME?
11/6/2010,"if only one security key can be associated with an account (typical) then this isn't making it easier for account sharing. you'd have to have the person your sharing with to call you (ts or w/e) and read the passphrase of the moment of to them. it's no different than if you where to reset your password for each person you share with prior to allowing them to login and then reseting it.sharing will continue to be a risk as you still don't know that the person you're sharing with won't otherwise compromise your account, wipe your items/isk, steal your mom&titan or otherwise. and when those situations get petitioned someone usually ends up taking the ban. (read recent evenews24)if this is combined with ip based security it would make it even more difficult for account sharing to take place."
11/6/2010,"i never said anything about it being easier.not true, you could recover your password because you still have the key.i was talking about account being secure, not assets.that is why you never petition account theft via sharing.yes but no one is talking about this.this feature could make account sharing safer. that said i support this proposal on the condition that all that is required to transfer all three characters on an account is a single rsa key entry."
11/6/2010,"i know there are reasons to not do this, but i believe the reasons to do it far outweigh them.characters, corporations, and alliances all save to the same name spaces. a lot of these names are taken by trial account players that tried eve in the early days when eve was completely different and will likely never return(at least to the same account)what i am suggesting is an extremely selective purge of character data for those that have never subscribed, and whose accounts have not logged in in the past 3 years. if you want to be even more selective you can delete only characters with less than a weeks worth of skill-points. these characters have very little invested in them and are littering the name space.the benefits given would be that new characters would have a greater identity to them as they would not have to be as obscure in naming or be enumerated(enumerated pilot names seem to break the sense of identity).at the very least could we get a bit of research on how many characters these parameters would encompass or any thought on if this will ever be managed."
11/6/2010,good idea.it would also be interesting to know how much purging ccp already does.
11/6/2010,"i like this idea. while certainly non-essential to gameplay, it would be nice to clear things up for new players, or those of us who want to snatch a famous name taken by some guy who played for 2 weeks in 2005. what a bastard."
11/6/2010,this.
11/6/2010,"+1just delete all chars with some formula, like this: trial: 6 monts, 1 times payed: year, 2 times: 1.5 years... ...6 times - never."
11/6/2010,yehp
11/6/2010,"leaving for 6 months and getting your stuff back is one thing, but characters and corporations from 2003 taking up the names (and corp tags!) are another. one possible solution is to use the mechanism applied to offensive names: rename the characters/corps to caldari citizen ######, and allow them to petition for a name change when they come back."
11/6/2010,why? so you can be the one to snatch up the name with an alt and sit in a corner chuckling to yourself?what a colossal waste of programmers time and money.not supported.
11/6/2010,"not only do i support this for the original intent, this kind of data should be 'housekept' anyways else you get an ever-expanding set of database tables.oh, also: red on gray is so damn annoying. so now you're pink."
11/6/2010,"supported.with the coming of dust 514 the namespace is about to get crowded. there will be mass frustration if every dust player has to settle for their 5th choice on a name because some 2003, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 eve account is holding their preferred choice. if they haven't been back in 2 years then they should have ""storage"" added to their name like ""closed"" for the corps. if they re-sub they can pick a new name or use their old one if its still available."
11/6/2010,"this,but i dont think dust will use the same system, it will just go by xbox live gamertag"
11/6/2010,"in a falcon that warps 3,75 au per second it takes 58 seconds to warp from an alighned position 94,6 au to another point.from those 58 seconds it takes 5,3 sec to get in warp (14,980t, 0,3848x inerta)from those 58 seconds it takes 37 seconds to get under 1 au from destinationit takes 21 seconds to slow down. that is 36% of the total warp timemy proposal is to reduce this time. this will encourange more traveling between systems and that is good for the quality of eve. (94,6 au/3,75au = 25,2 seconds yet it takes 2,3 times as much time) it makes no sence"
11/6/2010,"the problem is that acceleration isn't variable, every ship has the same accel/deccel for warp, so faster ships don't actually warp much faster - it's not possible to enter warp before another ship and overtake them in warp, and it should be for ships with a huge difference in warp speed (1.5au/s vs 21au/s)i am not in favour of a general increase in warp times, though. only a change so that ships with a warp speed advantage can benefit from it."
11/6/2010,"yes, because there's so little movement between systems these days.if you don't have a reason besides ""i want it plox!"" just say that. don't come up with some half-assed attempt to justify your request. it makes you look like an idiot."
11/6/2010,"trolling posts like this also make u look like a idiot i support this, i think it will encourage more small roaming. who is these days botherd to roam because they need to jump 45 minuts to travel 20 jumps to get to some hunting grounds"
11/6/2010,"i would like to add my vote to this too. for example i had to make a trade run yesterday with a ship that can carry around 14,000 m3 for a set of items that were 8,000 total that i could only carry about 2,500 at a time. so i had to make 4 runs back and forth in a indy. now this may not seem like a big thing but the trips were 31 jumps apart.(this was in a indy not a much slower freighter too!) it took me about 9 hours to do the run back and forth (i used autopilot as the hell i was going to click 2 times per jump 32 jumps both ways for ..yeah plus they were in high sec).i just think that is a bit long yes.jump clones are good but i think they can only be used one every 24 hours yes?there should be some way to improve travel times a bit. mainly as suggested warp speeds not sub warp speeds as that might throw off game mechanics a bit. but just having faster overall warp speeds for all ships might help a bit.as one girl pointed out in her video blog the reason why many women do not like to play eve is it takes forever to do anything!:-). (im a guy though) but just saying :-)give us some luv."
11/6/2010,"variable warp speed up yes shorter warps no, new eden feels already small as it iswhen you need to transport big amounts of stuff just ask someone with a big cargo ship or set up a courier contract sure courier contracts may take a while but you don't waste playtime on hauling it yourself"
11/6/2010,yes pls.
11/6/2010,"the npc slot balance issue can be solved easily by running a simple check on how many bpcs are put into the batch job. you can them just set an arbitrary max number of bpcs per batch.supported, though i'm skeptical ccp's gonna raise a finger at this issue.they love pandering until the last minute."
11/6/2010,mhmm.
11/6/2010,yup.
11/6/2010,new players can get faster into peeveepee = moar pvp'ing players => better for everyone.
11/6/2010,erm... learn more about the mission system in eve.and if you only pilot a drake with 900k sp... well.... a frigate pilot with 900k sp would most likely be able to pop you
11/6/2010,/signed
11/6/2010,nooooo ccp dont do this! really verry bad idea.
11/6/2010,i also say no to microtransactions ... not even neural remap!
11/6/2010,"lol, i really like this analogy. +kudos"
11/6/2010,except 0.0 wars are always free. why would anyone wardec to fight in 0.0
11/6/2010,"ccp asked the csm for ideas for incarna. well this one seems obvious: show the character's public decoration on their outfits, military-style. people with many decorations should be able to select a limited amont of them (5?) to display."
11/6/2010,"this is a neat idea actually.and if it's not going too far into dress up barbie territory, it'd be cool if corps and alliances could design their own uniforms and so on. i'm guessing there will be enough variation in the clothing for this to happen."
11/6/2010,heck^yes
11/6/2010,"decorations and stuff would be an idea yeah.outfits for the militias as well.could have other outfits too, with corp/alliance logos on them as well."
11/6/2010,very nice where do i sign ?
11/6/2010,"^ this. this has to be a point of excellence for them. it is part of the immersion of the game.imagine some close friends watching you play eve, and then they stop the awing experience to ask why you just clipped through that planet/moon..."
11/6/2010,"anyone familiar with that game also knows that you can lds through celestial objects as well, though you have to be going fast enough. i've flown through plenty of stars just to watch my heat gauge redline."
11/6/2010,"forum warriors, take it somewhere else"
11/6/2010,keep going. you are really helping the proposal.
11/6/2010,"+1especially in c&p. some days it feels like there's this one person who posts there, and nobody else.edit: i also like your implementation idea. i don't really see a downside."
11/6/2010,"exactly. and u prove my point yet again, trolling alt."
11/6/2010,"as an alt i support this idea, hell i even support the idea that only the highest sp character can post,"
11/6/2010,accepted!
11/6/2010,"yes!!!(nice monitor setup btw, that must be awesome to use in practice)"
11/6/2010,can you expand on how this is useful?
11/6/2010,"yeah, knowing my weight is useless in space...knowing my combined mass, on the other hand, would be most excellent."
11/6/2010,"i'm not talking about knowing it in space. as it is right now, when you have items in your hanger, unless you move them to a cargo hold, there is no way to see their combined weight. this would allow you to simply select multiple items in your hanger or in any cargo container and see what their combined weight would be."
11/6/2010,do you mean you want to see the combined volume in cubic meters (m^3) ? (ie... how much stuff you can fit into a cargohold of a ship)
11/6/2010,"exactly. i would like to be able to select multiple items both in hangers, containers and carp holds, any selection of different items and see their combined weight in (m^3).there are many situations i can imagine where this would be very useful. it wouldn't be very hard to implement i don't think as its simply a matter of selecting whatever combination of items you choose and have the weight show up in the right click menu."
11/6/2010,"let's clarify some terminology.the weight and mass of cargo is useless and unused information. the game never cares about how much mass your cargo has.however, the game does care about the volume occupied by your cargo. all cargo sizes and cargo limitations are expressed in cubic meters (m^3), which are units of volume.change your proposal to talk about the volume, not the weight or mass, and i'll support it."
11/6/2010,"this is a great idea that i can get behind. in addition to the jb (jump bridge) checking your cargo bay for fuel to activate, there should also be an option to check for any fuel in any stations in the constellation. maybe region but that might be too much.on another note, bittergin (minigin) needs to go back to his own mega fail thread about nerfing jump bridges and stay there. honestly man, you want to make something that needs fixed even worse? stop smoking that illegal stuff and start making sense."
11/6/2010,"see what i mean? anyways, low-comedy aside... nah, that makes them gravely op. with current mechanics, at the very least, in order to use a bridge you actually have to physically bring fuel to it, making haulers or other ships vulnerable to attack while they're adding fuel. allowing ships to use their cargo holds removes a layer of unnecessary aggravation, but allowing bridges to check stations (to say nothing of all stations in a constellation) allows a bridge that's functionally impossible for an enemy to keep un-fueled. if all you have to do is get to the bridge and click 'jump' and you don't actually have to bring resources to it, there's no way to prevent the flow of lo to the bring short of multiple corp-thefts and robbing every corp that has an office in ever station in the constellation (or even that station). not a good idea."
11/6/2010,"instead of vacuous raging, please describe what ""hypocracy"" you've convinced yourself exists. (the word, by the way, is hypocrisy. the suffix ""cracy"" denotes a form of government, so hypocracy would be a government ruled by lower oxidation states)please, no more trolling about having to type a password is equivalent to jumping without a cyno or the server running battles for the players. it's obvious that you don't actually belive it, and i've asked you to stop pretending that you have autism in order to troll people. there are people with the disorder (asperger's) that you're pretending to have, and in general they are some very decent people dealing with a very hard situation. you mocking them by pretending to be autistic in order to troll people on an anonymous message board is a really, really, really slimy behavior. there are people who have actual problems with obsessive and repetitive behavior rather than the stuff you engage in jut to troll people (the nc, the nc, the nc!!!). there are people who actually lack fundamental semantic understanding and are unable to recognize the nuances of how language works (it's easier to not type a password than to type a password, it's easier to have the server decide fleet fights while you go grab a snack instead of piloting, and it's easier to be able to jump anywhere in eve without a cyno, therefore they're all an easy mode of play in the exact same way!). and there are people who actually lack empathy and the ability to understand where other people are coming from (based on what you have said, i will define how you can have fun and whether or not you are really having fun doing what you're doing). for you to pretend to be autistic and mock them with your behavior simply to **** people off on the internet is shameful, and you really should be ashamed of yourself. stop it. autistic people have it hard enough without some guy on the 'net using their difficulties as some sort of sick joke. sick and shameful. do you actually have any logical arguments to contribute, at all, or is it simply ragetrolling? would you like to calm down and start over, and i can try to discuss whatever it is that's got you so angry without trolling?"
11/6/2010,no.i have a few old alts for somone to buy if this does go threw. 3 from 04 and 2 from 05
11/6/2010,"i imagine if you ask anyone who has tried eve online and has not gotten deeper into the game after the trial most of the time they're reply would be ""it takes forever to train for anything"". for long time eve players it is something that most wear with a badge of honor they are proud of the skills they have trained for, and rightly so. but for newcomers to eve it can be daunting. eve in itself has a lot of options already that can overwhelm players and over the past addons some things have been added to try to make new players feel more welcome (as well as corps like eve university and the like) but one of the biggest hurdle is skill training.the bad thing about skill training is that while eve advertises itself as a game where anything is possible where you are not set in stone who or what you can be. the training process pretty much restricts you. you can only train one item at a time. at first its not so bad because lower level skills do not take that long to train but once you get past those you start looking at better ships and fittings and then you start to see that for the better things it can require weeks if not months of training.if you add more skills or go on a different path for a bit , it just makes the other thing you are training for take that much longer.even with very high learning skills and implants it can still take a very long time to train things. i think there should be things added to help new players better and those who have been in eve for a while but still need to skill up.i think honestly skill remapping should be added a lot of people might not like the idea but at least say once every six months maybe (or even just once a year) you can change a certian percentage of your skills to something else if you want to.another idea would be for new accounts add double learning time for not just the first month or the first million skillpoints but maybe for the first year. many older players might not like this idea but...it would greatly help new players or players who have been in eve for a while but have not skilled up much. to get into the game faster.another option would be to allow for training two skills at a time. that way a person can now have the option to explore two paths at once instead of being stuck on one narrow road.another thought. expand the training queue from just one day to a week or maybe even a month. some people might not like that eitherbut lets face it do any of you really find it fun if you dont play too often to have to come in every day to recheck your skills?i think that can help also a system where you can inject skills you do not have the requirements for yet so that when a certain skill that is required for it trains up , you can train for it.and also have it in the queue that as long as you have planned to train for a skill or set of skills that is required for a certain skill (and have it injected) it can be added to the queue.i just think something like this should be thought about to really update the training system.it just takes way too long for people wanting to get into the game to really enjoy it.and after a while they might either get too frustrated to figure out what to train or get tired of logging in nearly every day or every other day just to trian up they might end up leaving.eve online has a lot of great things and its good that is has deep options and varied game-play but also consider that sometimes things can be a bit too much for their own good.a player might see all the cool videos about pvp but then not realize if you really want to get into pvp you need a good ship with good fittings even smaller ships require a good setup to succeed often and that can take months!now im not saying lets turn this into a game where a power-leveler can reach max skills in a week. im no where saying that.im just asking that some of these thoughts be brought up. thanks!"
11/6/2010,well that is what makes eve eve not everyone is supposed to like eve
11/6/2010,while we're at it let's make titans the starter ship. i've always wanted to fly one of those.

11/6/2010,"so true, jump bridges have needed changing for a long long time. also lawl @ nc scrubs trying to argue with minigin. you actually have to understand game mechanics to argue in this thread and no one in the nc has even a base understanding of how this game works. stfu scrubs"
11/6/2010,"hello,i believe that sovereignty is a broken game mechanic. it is far to easy for large alliances to be able to pay for sovereignty rather than actually having to defend it. they took sov at the change of the mechanic and then only have to ever defend it if someone decides to pay 350mil (per stargate) to contest it. with unlimited resources (isk) one could run 10 men to take sov from many alliances. one could blockade the many of systems one large alliance owns, and take the ones they choose not to defend.quoted from evewiki.eveonline.com---(on tcu mechanics) the structure is vulnerable to attacks while it is in the ""anchoring, ""anchored and ""onlining states. an online tcu is invulnerable unless both of the following conditions are fulfilled:sovereignty blockade units are anchored and onlined at more than 50% of the gates in the system.the sovereign entity over the system does not possess an outpost/conquerable station nor an online industrial hub within the system.if this statement was revised to say---the structure is vulnerable to attacks while it is in the ""anchoring, ""anchored and ""onlining states. an online tcu is invulnerable unless one of the following conditions are fulfilled:sovereignty blockade units are anchored and onlined at more than 50% of the gates in the system.the sovereign entity over the system does not possess an outpost/conquerable station nor an online industrial hub within the system.this would require the large alliances to actually fight for their space... which i believe they can do, they just aren't required to do by game mechanics. the game was once a game for those who liked large scale battles and one for those who like small scale battles. now small scale is not viable to contest sov.i understand being part of the minority (small warfare) i will not have many followers in this thread, but this isn't a popularity contest, it is a request for fair game mechanics for all who play it. thank you all for listening and for your time upon this subject.respectfully,sanicity"
11/6/2010,a further note.someone brought to my attention if the tcu used stront to go into reinforced than it would give the alliance time to stage a defense. reasonable arguement.with reinforced timer/stront capacity being dependant upon sov level.again thank you allsanicity

11/6/2010,"you'd be surprised. even the large alliances are rather fed up with the way sov warfare works post-dominion. the system heavily favors defenders and only encourages both sides bringing enormous fleets to one point of contention. i, for one, would be ecstatic to see a system in which small alliances can take and hold sovereignty from large alliances who are unwilling to at least mount a defensive effort. as nice as being a member of the ""naptrain"" is, having to fly 30 jumps to find someone to shoot at because every adjacent conquerable region is held by a rather small number of alliances is frustrating. i don't support this specific attempt at a fix, though, because it's trying to put a bandaid on a rather large problem, and i also don't believe that sov issues can be truly fixed until lag is reduced to reasonable levels."
11/6/2010,"stuffing everyone and their mother into one system is not ~pvp~trolling aside, i'd say the real issue with sov warfare atm is the timers, not the ability to attack the tcu. station + ihub hp is ridiculous, and the timers on those are heavily weighted in a way that you can force an attacking force to fight you in your most effective tz, thus allowing you plenty of time to cram as many people into a system as you possibly can to deter a ~good fight~"

11/6/2010,hi alli have a techy question if anyone can answer it :)i have two gas planets yet one has more buildings on it than the other one and the only difference i can find is in the gas planet informaion.one has a surface grav of 63.7m/s^2 and the other one has 12.1 m/s^2 does this mean that surface grav affects the ammount of buildings on the planets ?
11/6/2010,"you sure that one planet isn't just bigger than the other? pi modules are designed to look the same size on widly different planet sizes, so your links could be hundreds of miles longer and consuming more power/cpu each.ps: i don't think the assembly hall is the correct forum for questions like this, just for future reference."

11/6/2010,"when tech 3 cruisers were introduced, they were billed as the totally customizable ship. you were supposed to be able to switch from an active shield booster fit to a cloaky bubble immune fit with the same ship, as needed. and while this has proved true to some extent, something has always anchored the t3s down ever since they were released: rigs.think about it. every other module on the ship can be swapped out at a moment's notice, the entire ship can be disassembled and rebuilt into an entirely new ship. except for the rigs. when you install a rig you are committing to it. it can only be removed by destroying it. this is especially troublesome with t2 rigs as they are so expensive. this is entirely counter-intuitive to the purpose of the t3 cruisers.current rigs limit the customizability of t3 cruisers, especially when t2 rigs are involved, by forcing you to use a ship with a vast number of possible configurations as though it were just a single ship, with a single loadout.say i have a tengu. it's currently setup with a shield buffer and ham launchers, making it an impressive straightforward combat ship. since the ship is inherently expensive i decide to splurge on t2 core defense field extenders to improve the tank.now if i need to, i can't convert my tengu into a covert ops setup without either leaving the t2 shield rigs on, though they are useless to the covert setup, or destroying them, losing a large amount of isk in the process.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------so here is what i propose: tech 3 rigs.t3 rigs would have the same bonuses as t2 rigs, but in the spirit of the modular design of the tech 3 cruisers, they would be able to be removed without destroying them, thus allowing you to swap them out with the rest of the ships modules. this would allow the tech 3 ships to become the fully interchangeable platforms they were intended to be. in addition, it could be an opportunity to reduce the cost of t2 rigs and make them a little more viable in regular pvp, as the way prices are now, most t2 rigs are effectively off-limits to most pvpers. think of how ludicrously expensive t2 rigs are now. the price effectively prevents anyone (or at least anyone in their right mind) from fitting them to regular pvp ships. t3 rigs would be balanced by the same principle. t2 rigs would come down in price a bit, somewhere between where they are now and t1 rig prices, and t3 rigs would take their place as the expensive rigs. (though maybe not quite as ridiculously expensive as current t2 rig prices.)what do you think? thoughts? comments?"
11/6/2010,forgot to support my own idea. (the bump doesn't hurt either.)
11/6/2010,"you make an interesting point, however..it might make sense to allow t3 ships to remove rigs- any rigs, but only a limited number of times. for example, a cccii might be removable up to 10 times before finally exploding. where as a ccc1 only lasts five times."
11/6/2010,"but why limit the t3's customization in any way? to avoid non-t3s from fitting removable rigs? why would that matter? most normal pvp ships will never have them because:a.) they don't need them to be effective, non-t3 ships are generally bought and used with a single setup in mind.b.) the cost of the t3 rigs would make it not worth it to fit them to just any ship. (like current t2 rigs.)however, i believe it's in the spirit of the game to leave the t3 rigs fitting options open to t1 and t2 ships rather than limit player choice. in this case the balancing comes from the market, rather than game mechanics or ship stats."

11/6/2010,"actually it is.with every patch ccp would want the people using the test server to test every aspect of the game were possible, this includes stuff you do with npcs.also, i can't remember exactly were, but it has been stated that the test server, while also being there for patch testing is also ment to be used for ship testing.after all, how else would one test the effects of changes to ships.also, you might want to ask yourself this; why has ccp bothered placing all those beacons in fd- ?"
11/6/2010,"so then your saying its a good way to ""test"" all aspects of plex's by having them a) spawn in systems they wouldn't on tq. b) respawn everytime its completed (like anoms). c) not have to do all the foot work involved with the scanning out of the plex's as required on tq.my statments stands. ""if"" and ""when"" they make ship changes most times they give you the ships as a reward to test for bug's etc. plex's aren't broken or being changed with these future updates. although incursion will add a different kind of plex. and those are being spawned in a few systems just for the sake of testing (not this current version of the mirror, but the one upcoming in a week or two).the spawing of ships and plex's is not what sisi is about. it's the testing of ""current"" changes."
11/6/2010,"so any update on blob warfare ;) while i appreciated your reply 2 months ago it doesnt really change the fact that blob warfare has been one of the major problems with 0.0 and still is being ignored, yet blob masters such as vuk lau continue to be hypocritical saying they would love to get rid of blob warfare however not only does he ignore his own priorities he also promotes blobbing.stuff like this doesnt really help ccp with anything, how can ccp work with a team that arent even consistent with what they believe in, its like the saying goes ""practice what you preach"" and this by far was one of the biggest priorities csm agreed on yet once again least spoke about.the assembly hall in the last 2 months has increased in anti-blobbing threads, people are getting fed up with how numbers are ruining eve, with recent battles increasing past 3200 people are losing faith in both csm and ccp, especially since expansions such dominion were meant to promote encourage smaller alliances to enter 0.0. heavy abuses of blobbing are nc who managed to have 2200 people within one system (which was less than 50% of their nap list, since western nc was busy with ev0ke) just to counter 1000 players, which resulted in the server lagging @ 3200.all that has changed is ccp working on fixing lag which historically will return due to the mechanics of blob warfare, players are tired of blobbing, hypocrisy and ideas given to ccp that only helps a few players."
11/6/2010,"blob warfare was supposed to be addressed with the dominion expansion. ccp has stated they wanted small gangs to affect sov with the dominion expansion. what we got was another half finished expansion, with sov structures consisting of mega hp, so the only way to contest sov in a resonable time frame was to increase the blob, and blob with supercaps. excelence, at its best. the half finished system now, so grossly favors the defenders, that they litterally have to ""not want that space anyway"" for the attackers to have a chance at capturing any space at all.every 0.0 sov holder applauded the dominion expansion as ccp stated the goals, but when it went live every 0.0 sov holder was dissapointed, and the only comfort they could gather was,""at least it's not pos bashing/pos spamming.""ccp, finish the dominion expansion."
11/6/2010,"the lack of understanding here is shocking. as is the incoherent rage. the very term ""blobbing"" has no meaning at all, it's a content-free snarl word most of the time simply used to describe someone who can field more numbers than you can. let's not kid ourselves here, it's hardly an objective claim. (is 2:1 blobbing? how about 3:2? 4:1?) claims that ccp somehow has to fix the fact that, all other things being equal, greater numbers will have an advantage over fewer numbers are, simply, ignorant. what can ccp possibly do to alter the dynamics of reality itself? and no, fixing dominion won't get rid of it. you have a csaa pos someone else wants to take out? well, if they can raise twice the numbers you can, they have a much better chance of destroying it. you have a moon mining pos someone else wants to take down and tower up for themselves? well, if they can raise twice your numbers they can take down your pos, put up their pos, and defend it so that you can't take it back. you have a station that someone else wants, well...complaining that, in an mmo of all places (~gasp, shock, horror!~) people are working together in groups to beat other people working in groups, but gosh darn some of those groups are larger than the other groups so it's just not fair! well, let's say charitably that it simply misses the point. if people cannot handle the fact that in an mmo, there may be a mass of mutiple-players online who can oppose you, then mmo's aren't for them. single player games can have a finely tuned degree of balance. say, mass effect 2, even on insanity mode, never overwhelmed you with more than you could possibly handle. there were no complaints that the husks were ""blobbing"" you, even when they outnumbered you, because the game devs specifically crafted a balance so that the individual player would always have a pretty decent shot to fight through and win. but people seem not to understand that there is no such balance, and nor should there be, in a game that isn't a single-player game.and for some reason we see this whine and don't simply laugh, yet if it was another game we all would. if someoneme wanted to play modern warfare 2 online without it being so 'unfair' while they were one guy against a squad of 8 players and how they wanted infinity ward to ""fix"" the game so that numbers weren't so decisive. if one guy was playing team fortress 2 against 16 other people and complaining that he should still have a fair chance to defend his flag as well as capturing the enemy flag, we'd laugh at him. but when it's the exact same thing in eve, all of a sudden it's serious biznezz and ccp had better do something about the fact that mathamatics holds true in reality. math will always hold true in reality, there's nothing to be done about it. demanding that ccp stop math from working is, to put it gently, quixotic.p.s. if you want an mmo which does its best to get the ""fairness"" thing that people seem to want, world of warcraft has instanced areas with strictly limited groups that are able to enter. that seems to be what some people want, so rather than asking eve to change to that model it makes much more sense to go to a game that already has it."

11/7/2010,"i see, you're saying that the risk of having something unrecoverable stolen due to account sharing should be an effective limit on account sharing. i don't know that that is the case, i have heard of several situations where someone sharing an account just reported it as ""hacked"" and had their characters/items returned. (the article in evenews24 is the most recent such report of such a situation)if ccp where serious about account sharing violations they would have ip based access control and would be issuing warnings and temp bans for suspicious access. i've actually never heard of them doing this. personally i think they don't really care until it causes them a support ticket. you are right, security keys could remove one of the possible risks in sharing an account, however, there is still the risk to assets, corp/alliance roles, reputation. and i don't think that that those risks are really an effective deterrent in the first place. i think that the pain of communicating the key's pass phrase for every login would make most account sharing folks choose to use just passwords and not get a key."
11/7/2010,agreed.
11/7/2010,"should be part of the normal course of maintaining the game, and hence, not a waste of programmer time and effort."
11/7/2010,sounds like a good idea to me. supported.
11/7/2010,my idea behind it is that that roaming in small gangs is very time consuming without actualy travelling far. my idea behind it is to shorten this. warp speed is a good way to accompish this. a 20% reduction in a 4-5 hour roam (+-3 hour? of warping) is an exta 36 minuts time saving that u other wise spend staring at an almost static screen.
11/7/2010,"that wasn't trolling - it was honesty.trolling would probably have been either funnier, or sadder.the issue is, at it's heart, that small gang warfare has gone the way of the dinosaur in eve, but warping to more places faster will not fix that."
11/7/2010,"your small gang may be able to move around and find targets more quickly, but so can the blob that will overwhelm you, and so will the extra ships hiding in the next system who want to join the fight to make it 2v1 odds, and so will the supposed lone-wolf bait-ship's support be able to get into the fight and annihilate you before having a small chance to do something about it.bad idea, combat is not bottlenecked by how slow warping is.if it's for transporting large amounts of stuff in a freighter, deal with it. it should take much longer to move hundreds of ships in one go than fly them one or a few at a time in an industrial hull.-j"
11/7/2010,"you'd still have at least 1 session change per system (after jumping in), so the potential for time savings is perhaps not as great as the op indicates. that said, supported."
11/7/2010,"as others have said, there's no particularly compelling reason to increase warp acceleration rate across the board, but i'd like to see varying rates of acceleration according to ship size."
11/7/2010,"eve is too small as it is, this will just make it smaller."
11/7/2010,"i currently own a comet that does 11.7 au/s and for most jumps, i spend more than half of it speeding up and slowing down. acceleration/de-acceleration should be in line with au/s speeds. a ship that goes 9 au/s should accelerate/de-accelerate 3 times faster than a ship that only goes 3 au/s."
11/7/2010,"pos managementas we all know, at the moment it is very difficult to make member specific poss in a corporation.this thread will supply you with a problem and a reasonable and absolute solution. to start off with, corps at the moment cannot efficiently manage a pos for a specific member. you must give them a certain level of rights that could jeopardize your corp's poss as well as others poss. one must asign a dodgy role to do so and with that role that they must maintain they could easily thieve another pos. another temporarily solution is to allow the pos to be configured via corp or alliance. this is not very safe seeing as anyone at that point could then take down their pos.my solution:the solution is very simple and not difficult to implement and i am sure many would appreciate it. there should be an option on a pos to assign a specific person in a corp absolute power over every function of that specific pos and only that person could manage the pos. if they wanted to assign more specific roles to a friend of theirs they would have their own role management menu, but only for the pos that they own. you may ask yourself, but what about people who have config starbase equipment roles? anyone who has fuel and config roles for starbases would still be able to take down any pos regardless of who's it is. in that case only high officials would need that role for security reasons. i believe this solution is a reasonable one. another final management option on a pos should be to choose to keep the pos under the same (current) system we have now. this system would be called a corporate system. in other words, not a member pos, but a corp pos that would still be managed with the same roles we have now.pros: * more effective control over poss* privacy and self-protectioncons:* there are none?"
11/7/2010,just letting you all know i definately support my own proposal.
11/7/2010,"i agree with this, it would lower the amount of corp thieves and make managing a pos a lot more easier/supports"
11/7/2010,"sounds less like a fix and more like a band-aid or a quick patch. while it solves the ""i want my own pos"" problem it doesn't solve the whole corp shared pos issue. right now (and under your proposed system) someone needs access to the entire pos at a minimum to be able to do anything. they need their own wallet, their own corp hangar, everything. they also need access to see everyone else's jobs.i think that needs to be fixed more so than having an entire pos to yourself. i don't know how popular the idea is but it seems that at least some people setup a pos for the entire corp to use for themselves as well as the corp itself. that means members can research their own bpos, manufacture, whatever. right now that means each member needs their own wallet division, corp hangar and the role to view (and cancel) everyone elses jobs.i think it would be far more useful to stop doing it how it's done now. to treat a pos more like a mini station that can only be used by the corp. to let members set up jobs from their personal hangar and their personal wallet (skills for remote research/manufacture required, of course). have the materials in their personal station hangar, set up the job as with any npc station except select the pos array, and presto. i like your idea, i just think it needs expanded more. it only solves the issue for moon mining and such."
11/7/2010,i was saying that what my fix does is allow any module that is anchored on a pos to be the sole property of that specific pos owner. if the owner wanted to he could lease out rights to certain modules to members of his corporation using his own control system.
11/7/2010,any more pros or cons to consider?
11/7/2010,"i like it. should work for research too.a compromise if ccp doesn't like this is maybe make it only work in a pos array/lab. this eliminates the only con that has been thought of thus far. i feel open to all is a better option than restricting it to just pos users, though i'd rather have it for just pos's than not at all.--i too would also like to see it not take up another spot if you are queuing after your own job. ie, if i want to make 1000 runs of emp s then 1000 runs of emp m right after it, i should be able to queue those up in that order and only use 1 manufacturing skill slot. basically have it work like the skill queue in a way. this would need an interface redesign though (<- not a bad thing). i actually tried doing this once just assuming it'd work like that because it made sense.ps: menu option name suggestions: ""queue in succession""/""successive queue"" = queue one after another in the same slot, ""queue multiple"" = queue each in its own slot."

11/7/2010,"learning skills are a pain in the ass. this fix is doable, surprisingly, in a matter of hours instead of days (might take ccp a day or two to work out all the bugs, lolololol) but learning skills are just an overall pain in the arse. i would personally rather start being able to pew pew someone's head off at day one than spend several months training learning skills. nevertheless, keep learning implants. that is only fair, imo."

11/7/2010,"as a relatively new player i have this to say:i did not like training them, but i did train them a bit. on my main (this character) and my alts that i made.my friends that i got to join did not like training them but agreed that the eventual benefits were worth the wait.my friends and i are in agreement that it still takes too long as a new player to not suck. as someone else somewhere else on the forum said, you basically sign up, make a skill plan and wait 4-6 months to start playing. i'm not sure what there is out there to fix this, if anything, but if ccp removes learning skills and doesn't make up for the training time increase then this is just made worse.so i agree with the original post to a point. if learning skills are removed or made otherwise ineffectual it will not bother me as long as i get the sp back to use on other skills in some form **and** something is added to replace the benefit they provided (either more base attribs to assign or some speed bonus, maybe an implant? i don't know). i still spent time training them (my one character got them to 5/4) so i should get to keep that sp to spend on something else.for #3 on the original post, the 10,000% faster thing is odd, i think they should just go back into the unallocated sp pool. i'm not 100% sure how that works as i wasn't around for that whole ""free sp"" thing, but i'm aware of its existence and it sounds about right for this."
11/7/2010,i am new to this forum and i am surprised at the fervour with which this topic has been discussed. i have always viewed the learning skills as tools. i was prepared to get them to a level with which i felt the cost/benefit ratio was right for me and then got on with the job of getting other skills. i don't think that i would lose much sleep if the learning skills disappeared so long as i was compensated for the effort i originally put in. in the end it's all one to me if they go or stay.
11/7/2010,not supportedi didn't like training them but the playoff is well worth it.
11/7/2010,"[troll] yes plz giev mah sp now so i can trains dread?![/troll]okay, now that thats out of my system, lets begin.i started reading this and my view was ""are they serious? why on earth would they remove them..."", but then i talked with few buddies of mine that i attempted to get to play earlier on; and suddenly i found more interest from their direction as i flashed this idea.bottom line is that as said before, they feel that these skills are something that 'must' be trained as the first skills in eve; being older gamers we feel the need to min-max. but they are at the same time unwilling to pay for their subscription for several months before they can even start training skills needed to fly tacklers with me, or maybe salvager for mish running if we're in empire.what i'm trying to say here is that even with this minor change in the skill training system i got more interest; and i'm certain it is not limited to just my friends.now to the method of how it should be paid back; i admit having 3,5mil (sorry, 5-4 only.) sp gone missing would **** me off big time; but i trust this is not the way they'd do it as it would be a big ****-you note for everyone playing currently / in immediate future, and as such would highly out-weight any possible benefit. now if it would be given us to freely redistribute then, being the jerk i am, i would gladly accept. it would give me instant access to rather few ships. that aside; i don't think anyone would mind it other than losing their sp/h advantage over newly started; but they do have severe lead already that cannot be brought down unless the newbie suddenly gains access to +5's, and the older player has +4's.beside i don't mind even then; as i already am proficient with my selected ships, the newbie would have to train them all to be at same line; and even then i'd have something more.bottom line, on contrary to my original reasoning i am for this and would like to vote my support on the condition that i am refunded the sp spent on learnings; if this is not met whatsoever i cannot help but to feel violated. i wont make any futile threats that ""i quit!"", as i know damn well i wont. but still, it would make me as owner of 2 accounts very sad.<insert sad panda face>"
11/7/2010,"i only became for this idea when they put in the floating-sp system where i could put sp where i wanted.now i want that 5.4m sp to put where i want.giev plz. honestly though both my accounts already have 5/5 so i don't care how this ends up. i would not mind being able to max out some of the more esotetic racial skills with that sp though relatively painlessly.i suppose i can also understand the plight of the rookie in which it is an annoying obstacle to get to the ""fun"" of the game, however when i started playing (back in my day lol) it was seen as sort of a ""it's good, do it when you want to get around to it"" sort of thing.i blame impatient older players trying to force perfection onto rookies for the current stigma that it needs to be done right away."
11/7/2010,i don't like the idea of plex for remaps.
11/7/2010,"i will not buy plex (with isk or with $) to obtain remaps, however, i am not against other people doing it.i am impartial. this change does not effect me and it seems it doesn't really effect anyone. most of the people downing it seem to think it will just be the start of something bigger. if it stops here, i don't care if it's added.as much as i'd personally love the idea of me being able to buy sp for $, it's no fun if everyone else can, so i do have to down vote that. lol.ps. to everyone that's all ""micro transactions are the devil!!11 ebil i say, ebil!!!!1111"" i have 2 things to say:1- $17.50 (it's not $15, why does everyone keep saying that? it's $35/2 = $17.50) is hardly a micro transaction.2- ccp is obviously aware that they will have to add them eventually to compete with other mmos.now, poor ccp is like, well if we can't add that #%^@#^ what do we add then?!?! i came up with the following:1- skins for ships! i'd buy those. i'd pay maybe $1/skin ($2/skin if it was themed in a way that was licensed from someone else, see example below) as long as there was enough that it'd be somewhat unique. if there was only 2 choices/ship, i would not pay; if there was 10+ i would. (i would absolutely not pay if the skin was lost with the ship destruction even if it was 10 cents per skin)"
11/7/2010,"we already have microtransactions.pay $35 for 2 plex, sell plex, buy nifty battleship.so i think you guys should be more precise in your protest.i hear two things(my interpretation), which are the following:1) high sp characters should remain unique. in other words, you shouldn't be able to buy sp, or train sp faster (remaps) by using isk or $$. this preserves the uniqueness of high sp characters and makes them more rare. i agree w/ this.2) plex should be the sole link between $$ and isk, and the price should remain high. no one wants ""you must pay $1 to fight in system xuy-023"" or ""to buy that skillbook, you need $2."" by keeping plex relatively expensive, it prevents this type of thinking (even though economically it is still part of the game). that helps roleplaying. also decreases the hassle factor.fwiw - sp are currently purchaseable via the character bazaar. so it is inaccurate to say ""no $$ for sp."" the supply of characters, however, is very constrained, and the transfer fee sets a floor on the types of characters that are tradeable.if the transfer fee is removed, we could very easily see a character bazaar filled with all types of characters trained in just 1 skill... in that way you could buy skills. but as is - at $20 or 725m isk - it is too expensive to have trade such characters. that menas it is only practical to buy characters are the upper levels of the game or with significant $$ investment (2b isk = $35 x 3 = $105)i think the discussion would be much better with more succint points.1) keep sp purchasing rare.2) maintain the $$ to isk exchange rate at $35 minimum (regardless of isk value)."
11/7/2010,"i dare say it, bumping this thread. there has not been enough opinions/flaming."
11/7/2010,"considering it costs less than 2 million to start a new corp, i'd say this is a bit on the high side.the key is finding the balance point where people who don't want to fight aren't constantly getting grieved (because believe it or not it's not fun), but someone can't just corp hop to run npc missions with no tax.i think a flat fee + bid system is one of the better ways to resolve it. the aggressor would pay the initial fee (which really should be in the range of 50-100m), target can match (maybe at a 10% discount or so) to cancel before war goes active. if they do the aggressor can raise their bid to any amount, and the target would have to repeat the process to cancel it.of course, corporation creation fees need a bit of an adjustment too, so as to not insanely buff corp hopping."
11/7/2010,"my lord, that is an epic idea, i like it. i second your idea."
11/7/2010,"why not just scale the price to the number of members. either it could scale based on the compared amount of members (ie, if you have 2x as many members as the corp you want to wardec, it costs twice as much as normal) or it could be a fixed price based on your member count (ie, 10mil per member)example for a comparative fee: say the normal price is 100m...10 man corp wants to dec 10 man corp? 100m10 man corp wants to dec 100 man corp? 100m20 man corp wants to dec 10 man corp? 200m100 man corp wants to dec 50 man corp? 200m100 man corp wants to dec 10 man corp? 1000mfor fixed price based on member count it'd just be like 10m * members, or 20m * members, or whatever amount is decided upon.there should be some sort of mechanic (or rule) to prevent people from just having everyone leave the corp, place the war dec, and rejoin. perhaps something like standing where it takes a week for the system to recognize there is less members in the corp (but not for more members) or some other ""smart"" feature that makes it unrealistic/annoying to ""trick"" the system.could also factor in corp age too. deccing a significantly younger corp could increase the price. perhaps using an ""average age"", average the age of all characters in the corp. having lots of younger alts join won't help you defeat this when placing decs because then you will have more members which raises the price for placing a dec on someone else or will decrease the price for placing a dec on you by a larger corp. so this one combined with the above balances itself.---another option independent of those is maybe pay a fee to concord (as an isk sink) for protection/immunity from war decs in highsec. the fee should be quite large, significantly more (at least double) than it costs to place a war dec, and should scale to the number of members you want to protect, ie 200mil + (10m * member count). the fee should not cancel any war decs already in place. so paying it will not make decs go away or be unable to be removed/renewed. that means you have to pay it all the time if you want the protection. also, you cannot place wardecs while ""protected"" and any you have should cancel. it should also take a day to initiate just like a war dec does.since threats for most corps are not ""all the time"" and the fee will be high enough per member, it would likely only be used by corps with absolutely no interest in pvp. it wouldn't pay any corp which could properly defend itself against most threats to pay the fee. that means only pure pve corps would use it.this would also give corps that target rookies a recruiting advantage since they could promise ""safe"" (well, eve safe) corp play.perhaps add another penalty to it, such as concord adds 5% tax to all members in addition to whatever your corp taxes. so if your corp wants to tax 10% and concord adds their 5% and all your members take a 15% tax which is a lot and they aren't going to like that.another option for a penalty is to still allow war decs but only protect the targets in very high sec (say 0.7 and above).perhaps also make the option unavailable for very old corps (after say, a year, the option becomes unavailable). though this might be unfair.--for the record, i prefer the first option over the second but am happy with either.in any case, i support an increase in war dec fees, either as stated in the original post or as i just stated."
11/7/2010,"well ancyker, i've heard that idea proposed before and at the time i liked it. the problem is we have to think like ccp and think of a way to make changes that will cost next to nothing to implement and **** off at least half of the player base. ;)the amusing thing is that the pvp base thinks ccp sucks up to the carebears and the 'bears think that ccp sucks up to the pvp crowd. on average i just see a lot of sucking on ccp's behalf but i'm not sure that any one group is at the center of it. (j/k ccp <3) though in all seriousness, one day we'll all wake up and realize that we have ccp right where they want us. i just hope they include a tube of ky with incarna."
11/7/2010,"i guess the general gist of this thread, minus a few trolls, is the fact that corporation on corporation wardecs need to be increased in price. i will admit, an alliance in 10 wars that cost 550 mil does seem a bit high, but overall fair if you consider the fact that wardecs are by choice.i am going to edit the proposal and change it to something on more general terms. ""there needs to be a change to the cheapness of wardecing prices in high sec"" and ""that there needs to be an increase"".any other mechanic fixes, i would like to be avoided in this thread. yes, they can be suggested, but the overall goal is to adjust the wardec costs towards market inflation. the more complicated the change, the less likely it will ever be fixed or adjusted. keep that in mind folks. ccp only has a very small team, if any, focused on fixing bugs/making adjustments in eve. if you want eve stop rush-fixing a few of their releases, there is a quality control thread ""excellence"" somewhere around here. post in there too, and give opinions.eve excellence:"
11/7/2010,"since people are obsessed with comparing blobbing to rl i figured why not add rl related stuff in game.a while ago a npc crashed his nyx into a station; i think players should be allowed to crash their super caps into stations destroying the station and super cap completely.this is very much like rl, like where people crash trucks into shops and cars into houses and has already been done in eve already so why not.in addition to crashing into stations they should be allowed to self destruct causing huge aoe damage or crash into other super caps causing both target and said suiciding cap to die.this happens in rl and has happened in eve by npcs therefore it should be allowed by players.when a supercap hits a station, station will turn to rubble will not be dockable and all loot / assets will be able to be collected / looted (with a huge % destroyed)when a supercap activates self destruct an aoe like effect similar to titans old dd will be caused, destroying thousands of sub capswhen a supercap crashes into another super cap both super caps will diejust like rl!!1"
11/7/2010,never stop posting.
11/7/2010,just like rl!!1
11/7/2010,i propose that eve should actually be like this trailer.
11/7/2010,yes the abbadon should have the orb of death attack that 1hits titans and other cap ships
11/7/2010,"militia outfits/uniforms are a good idea. i'm not sure about showing corp/alliance logos on clothing - either it would be too small to be noticeable, or too large to be realistics (you don't see the nation leaders nowadays with huge us flags on their shirts). maybe allow alliances to design their uniforms in a similar ways corps can design their logos - i.e. picking from a relatively large set of options.supporting my own proposal."
11/7/2010,supported.
11/7/2010,"could be like how sports teams have their name in big letters on the back. having say, a jacket, with your corp logo on the back, to go with more normal clothing, maybe."
11/7/2010,more like a black leather biker jacket with a guristas pirates symbol on the back supported.
11/7/2010,oh man this is totally catering to my secret dictator fetish in which i am the ceo and i make a bunch of awesome medals for myself and the people who actually do work in my corp don't get them. i do though
11/7/2010,i second that fully decorations!corp and race military uniforms!one step forward to bringing the eve feel back to eve
11/7/2010,"something i wish eve let you do was put kills on your ships... so say you get a solo kill in an ishkur, on the ishkur you got that solo kill in you could paint that kill on the side...dunno if anyone else has ever thought this would be an awesome idea... but sounds kinda like this so thumbs up."
11/7/2010,+1 - make it so you can get local back with a 'communucations array' anchored at a pos with an ihub module installed. (like cyno beacons).
11/7/2010,"also if more than 30 people are in local, it will display the number of people in local, but not who they are. this way you can keep track of blob battles in systems that are not controlled."
11/7/2010,"that's very true! though i'd have to say that only occurs when you're manually piloting while in warp :) there's no chance ccp would ever implement that , though avoiding celestials when using autopilot warp seems very possible."
11/7/2010,supporting with maini guess this is more of a symbolic gesture than anything else at this point but hey there you go.
11/7/2010,updated to reflect volume instead of weight.
11/7/2010,"i agree. i don't like having to keep an empty station container sitting around to check volume. there should be a way to see the volume of a stack of items as well as multiple stacks. doing maths is lame, yo (seriously).this doesn't change the game play at all, so there is no con. it's a very simple feature to add i imagine and there really isn't a reason not to add it.ps. adding it in a menu is odd, just display it on hover. so when 1 item/stack is selected, display volume of it; when multiple items are selected, display combined volume.for hovering:giant secure container - 3,000 m310 - veldspar - 1 m3125,042 items - 1,320 m3"
11/7/2010,it would be useful- supported.
11/7/2010,"indeed ancyker, i didn't think of a hover approach to visualization. i wonder though if that would be a nuisance in the long run to have a volume tool tip pop up every time you hovered over a group of selected items too long."
11/7/2010,"issuethere is a problem on large planets that cause the placements of structures to be very long. the length of this distance causes the power consumed by the links to be far greater than on any other smaller planet. this graphics problem prevents the placement of at least one building (processor, extractor) because of the extra power consumed by the extra-long links.the length of the links are forced upon the user. the interface will not place the structures any closer than approximately 120km, whereas on any other planet the distance is more like 20km. i am told via petition that the reason for this is because of the distance of a pixel. something about a pixel and the scale of the graphics of the larger planet. its great to have an awesome looking environment to play in. but, why should the realism of the planet size come at the expense of consistency in the way that we interact with the planets? its a trade of realism for the looks of the graphics for the realism of the placement of the buildings. the prevention of placing my building at 20km because of a graphics pixel is not realistic, not to mention illogical.there is no documentation informing the effect that planet size has on the placement of buildings.it is very frustrating to go through the process of placing a colony on a planet exactly the same way you have for three or four other planets, and find out this planet is different somehow.proposal1-the ultimate solution is of course to change the internal mechanics so that the size of the planet does not affect the placement of the structures on the planet. 2-change the gas command centers so that they have more powergrid to account for this pixel problem.3-add a note on command center description that explains the issue of problem size. give a specific limit of planet size that will cause this issue. for instance ""a planet greater then size x will cause this issue"""
11/7/2010,"you just spent an entire week ranting about how things are working as they were intended and then you say jump bridges need to be fixed, they arnt easy enough to use yet????lets not throw stones in glass houses."
11/7/2010,"there is a bit of a difference between not having to enter a password to jump every time, and having the game make tactical decisions for the player (locking / selecting ammo).ccp have been trying across the board to make some of the tedious things easier to get through. stuff like ""align to"" on bookmarks. it was possible to do before by know which celestial the bm was near and aligning to that instead, or manual aligning. now it's less steps to go through to accomplish the same thing. the player still has to setup the bms, and plan ahead to use them. (sarcastic suggestion, how about being able to warp to anywhere at any range instantly...) see what i did there, bit of a difference. stuff like combat hotkeys that are coming in incursion. shortcuts to give your ship tactical commands, the player is still thinking and making the decisions, just easier to execute them. not having to enter a password every bloody time is not going to give a player advantage. it would simply remove one of the needless tedious annoyances in the game. again, i think bridges could use a look at balancing, but making them awkward and annoying as a balancing point is fail. did you get around to reading some of my other idea's on dominion sov battles ?"
11/7/2010,"yes, there are some bigger fish to fry, but there's no reason they can't fry a few shrimp too. most bridges only circumvent a few jumps. in a long haul across the nc's jump bridge network we're actually lucky to cut the jumps to destination in half with bridges. example, to get to lxq for me by bridge is 25 jumps, 39 by gate to gate. yes it's a difference, but not several hours difference as you seem to suggest by your ""20 mins"" per bridge comment. if we want to balance how effective bridge are in moving people around, well their being annoying to use should not be part of that balancing, it's just frustrating. i don't really agree that 0.0 is boring ""because of"" the big coalitions. i think that people are going to group up until a practical limitation in the group is reached. it is human nature, and ccp encourages this in eve. what makes eve boring in light of the big coalitions is that there are few opportunities for smaller independents to compete, and that the mechanics that ""artificially"" determine who controls sov encourage large blob warfare. definitely not what we expected when ccp described their intention for dominion to have ""emergent and declarative sov control""i expected something very much like how the industrial and military indexes worked. simply being in the space, defending it, exploiting it, would give you claim over a system. a combination of pve and pvp achievements would gain and maintain sov.be interrupted from pve or slaughtered in pvp and your control would wain.even if tcu's and sbu's and such where removed completely (which i wouldn't cry about) capital fleets would still have a place in attacking key infrastructure, like those bridges you like going on about. if you really want to focus on the bigger things we could do to improve the 0.0 game let's, i've given you several opportunities to discuss and you just stick to your trollish hardline of raging on the nc."
11/7/2010,"it's quite obvious that i am not a defeatist, i have presented multiple times ideas for improving dominion on a scale much greater than simply jump bridges. and it is ccp that is encouraging the nature to form large political groups, it's part of their ideology for this game.i've given you several chances to have a discussion about things that might actually help the gameplay but you persist in drilling anti nc into everything you say and squeezing every ounce of conflict out of the smallest of disagreements (passwords on a bridge)it is you who is ridiculous."
11/7/2010,"again you are lying and trolling. i believe that the harshest word used so far has been ""annoyance"". of course you are a liar and claiming that there is any 'outrage' going on. oh, and speaking of you trolling:x2 of course, if you actually have a problem with human nature (people will often cooperate if it brings them an advantage), math (2 is more than 1, 3 is more than 2) and a mass of multiple-players online who evince human nature and a basic understanding of math, then obviously eve is not the game for you. again, there are quality single player games out there for you, and if you like trolling people online or whatever, then you can go play wow which has balanced, instanced dungeons rather than letting any number of people who want to cooperate work against any number of people who're opposing them. yes, a minor annoyance like having to hit a g key or retype 3-6 letters is hardly a major issue. it's a shrimp in comparison to real fish that have to be fried. but removing minor annoyances is, likewise, an absurd reason to get you ragetrolling."
11/7/2010,"look no offence to you, but your ideas are not particularlly good on the sov mechanics. they are extremely hard to impliment, and furthermore it ignores a lot of issues with alliances being able to exploit stuff like third party involvement, avoiding fights etc.your system isnt reasonable to be implimented and it will never be looked at by ccp for pretty obvious reasons.the way to go isnt change things again, because there will always be unforseen problems. the way forward is actually to go back imo.regions need to be made of extremely different value, travel needs to be significantly impeeded for larger entites and if i had my way, removal of the standings system. - another thing which should be looked into is exponential rates to be enforced on space holding to limit alliances taking space they arnt using.if you want to form a large alliance, you have to formalise it and deal with the problems that come with a lumbering entity. not this garbage where you can maintain the benefits of being a smaller alliance and derive all the benefits of being a giant super alliance with lion feet and eyes of ruby.of course who are we kidding... some dev is just going to run along and say ""wouldnt it be cool if..."" and sov will remain ******ed."
11/7/2010,"and this is why mini needs to leave eve and go to wow already. same old whine. mini wants easy mode and ccp has to give it to him. not that travel should be impeded for smaller entities, nah, but it's the larger ones. there shouldn't be any sort of synergistic, emergent behavior as has been designed into the system from day one and is a feature working as intended. as always, this issue is really about mini being impotent to accomplish change in eve and wanting ccp to do it for him. ""larger entities"", e.g. anybody who can work together to field more forces than mini can deal with, need to be ****ed over by ccp. and again, mini simply doesn't understand eve and can't adapt, so mommy ccp needs to save him and give him easy mode. he's even against the ability for people to work together at all past the alliance level, and he also wants to be able to nerf any alliance that's bigger than his group so that they can't operate effectively. just, whatever happens, ccp needs to make sure to alter game mechanics to help him, since he can't do it in game. to say nothing of how he is, again, pretending to be autistic. an autistic person can't use enough empathy to figure out that people like having friends, and compatriots, and like having a team that can beat the other team. mini understands that groups will work together, but is pretending to have the same damage so that this even begins to make sense, as if the eve playerbase couldn't simply filter their overview by tickers and not shoot at people they like, and as if they too are ignorant of math and don't understand that 1>2>3. again he thinks that if he pretends to have autism and tries to make it really annoying to refute his nonsense, he wins the internet. anything to alter game mechanics so mini doesn't have to compete. and again, there's a sandbox, a mass of multiple-players are online using it, and they've found ways to carve it up. but mini wants to stop that (and is ignorant enough to think that lots of alliances are claiming sov and paying sov fees for space they really don't use). then again he's probably lying as, previously, he's described using space for jump bridges as not using space. how using something becomes not using it is probably only a troll that makes sense to mini. again a nakedly obvious statement about how mini needs ccp to directly intervene to help him. large alliances have more people cooperating, and he can't figure out a way to fight them. as a result, ccp has to change the game and actually cause them ""problems"" so that they're now ""lumbering"", and then maybe mini can accomplish things. .same old, same old. this isn't about game mechanics at all, this is about altering everybody else's play-styles because mini can't compete or adapt."
11/7/2010,"you are incredibly stupid... if i wanted your space, id come join your alliance...despite what you might think you arnt my ""mortal enemy"" because im not stupid enough like you to believe i should dislike people because they are in an alliance i am not allied with... (and on the other hand blindly support an alliance i am allied with)you talk about ""the sandbox"" and why this means ccp shouldnt place limitations on standings. well thats the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard. i dont think standings should ever have been included. for example, a big reason a sandbox game is the way it is, is that decisions made by players can affect the outcome. now if there are no standings available, there is a decision given to the players. merge into an alliance to get those extra numbers, negotiate a nip, or remain on neutral/hostile terms.this is the hight of a sandbox game. a sandbox game is not ""dont worry what you decide, because you can just set standings to every entity this side of the hemisphere and your choices will be irrelevant from now on, futhermore with any luck there will only be at most 2 or 3 super coalitions to chose from at any given time and their playstyle is essentially identical and largely unsupported by our servers.""rather than putting realistic and unintrusive measures in place to allow alliances to opperate as alliances... but i guess im just a liar a troll and a spastic... so hey... lets just do what you think is right."
11/7/2010,"so mini thinks it's smart to lie and claim that anybody has ever said that he wants anybody's space, at all. and/or he simply has no reading comprehension skills, and believes that's a good basis to call someone stupid. it's a bit like saying ""there is no such country as brazil, and you're incredibly stupid if you think there is!""it's quality palatr. his perpetual, frothing, sputtering, incoherent babbling rage over the nc says otherwise. of course, liars have to have very good memories and mini's evidently lasts about 12 seconds. just a few posts up he's babbling about how he doesn't like ""nc guys"". oh yeah, which is also funny because then his next lie/troll is about how he doesn't dislike people based on which alliance they're in. mini is again proving that he is almost incapable of posting without lying (and also that, by his own definition, he believes himself to be stupid). i wouldn't go that far, i think he's only pretending to be stupid. he can, of course, not find anywhere that i said i dislike people in alliances i'm not allied with, because he made it up. in point of fact several of my buddies over the years have been in different alliances and enjoy different play styles. but mini likes lying. he's also inventing something whereby i blindly support... anybody. anybody who's read anything i've written about rzr/nc ****ups knows that mini is, again, lying in order to troll. (you can also know he's doing that because today is a day that ends in the letter y)here mini demonstrates that he has no grasp on logic, at all. something is evidently 'ridiculous' about a sandbox allowing the possibility of both cooperation and opposition. with a straight face, this raging anti-nc troll thinks that ""don't interfere with me"" and ""shoot on sight"" should be the only options but ""let's help each other"" is just wrong and breaks the sandbox. i'm not sure, but i'd wager that guilds in wow are pretty much along those lines and when they enter the instanced dungeons that would make mini happy due to no numerical advantages, they have to fight as guilds and can't ally with other guilds. not sure, but it if so it seems that mini really should get over to wow already. here mini is just trolling and doesn't even believe his own nonsense. ""non-intrusive"" measures including geometric growth to sov fees, not allowing alliances to set standings and (only for larger entities) travel beiong significantly impeded. it's up to a troll like mini to try to rationalize how significantly impeding someone is non-intrusive."
11/7/2010,lets help each other is... lets join the same alliance...i mean im not sure if you want to believe im raging or you want other people to believe it... but im pretty sure your significantly more angry than i am as im yet to repetatively abuse you for pretending to be autistic...
11/7/2010,"i don't see how they are difficult to implement at all. eve already has military and industrial indexes that are tied to very granular activity metrics. add another index for security and have it change based on kills/losses (insurance systems' valuations) ratting/mining activity, structure reinforcement and destruction. i think it would do a great job of allowing an attacker to go up against someone who avoids fights or blobs. pos infrastructure is key to almost all alliances in 0.0, if they don't show up to defend it put it into ref and that will deteriorate the security index there. shoot the station services into incap, more security index loss. if they blob, split up and attack lines of supply (bridges and ratting/mining systems/stations). all of this varied battle will allow an attacker to widle away the security index of a sluggish larger opponent. after the index has been reduced it could allow - faster sbu anchoring- favorable station / hub timers (attacker sets preferred timezone in sbu)- lower hp on structures (perhaps through resist mods). these are easy changes to implement in the existing ""sov endgame fights"" what i am suggesting would give smaller entities a chance to do something meaningful against a larger/uncoordinated opponent. but numbers will still matter, a small alliance is not going to take and hold space in the territory of a larger entity. it seems that you would have ccp put some arbitrary restriction on the size of fleets, on the size of alliances, on the size of groups of players so that a balanced fight may be had. they have stated that these kinds of restrictions are against their very ideal's for eve.if we draw the line at alliances as you suggest, then everyone will just form up into bigger alliances. i agree we probably wouldn't have an alliance as large as the whole nc coalition, but look at the recent it come back, they have done quite well under a single banner approach. (~6000 members). and then when we're down to a couple mega alliances we'll be taking about eliminating alliances and keeping it to just corps, so that small corps can compete in the world of mega alliances."
11/7/2010,"i don't read anything about arbitrary restrictions in minigin's suggestions. he's just saying (rightly) that the fact you can designate a clearly visible blue bff status to a limitless number of otherwise unknown to you players makes the cat-herding of coalition forces a much more feasible process.i don't think removal of standings is a panacea myself, but i'd sooner see simple changes like that rather than some bloat-filled overhaul of sov with more indexed and confounding metagaming."
11/7/2010,"i'm not suggesting confounding metagames.simply this, get your fleet and go do damage to your opponent, damage their assets, damage their activity level, just hurt them in any way, and it will be affected in the security index. a wide array of strategies to weaken an opponent become viable means to conquer space. no longer is the only option to bring a huge blob to kill sov structures."
11/7/2010,"wait so are you suggesting that if you dont defend your own space (and actively) the said index will drop?i must admit its an interesting idea, but i dont understand how this index would be related to kills and such, eg an accidental roaming gang could end up taking sov... or a tiney entity with no interest in sov may accidentaly drop the rating to a level where another entity may come and take advantage of that?"
11/7/2010,"you'd have to quantify variables and values for every ""way"" that the index can be affected. pretending for a moment there would be no obvious ways to abuse it, i think it sounds over-zealous. trying to solve blobbing by creating a plethora of new sov. objectives doesn't solve the problem of thousands of players being interested in defending a single system and my experience tells me it wouldn't stop another 3k fleet from forming up."
11/7/2010,"yeah, i know, a simulator of a simulator, nonetheless, i think this idea has some merit.i would like to see something like an eve arena where folks with fake ships (as in virtual virtual ships) could play on teams or solo in death matches, team death matches, capture the system (or flag), scan-wars maybe, and other minigames like that, sort of like the bg's in wow, but rather just to be something without any reward or loss, so that it doesn't make up for pvp outside of the simulator (it's just a fun toy someone might use instead of station spinning). i would also like to see this being available only in high-sec stations while someone isn't at war or flagged for combat, so someone couldn't **** time away while they are being engaged by someone else.also, for mining, i would like to see a drastic improvement to this by making a minigame out of it. i would like to see something like an asteroid where you have to clear away non-valuable ore in order to get to the good stuff (without destroying the valuable materials in the process), or be able to, by chance, have an asteroid have surprises inside, like possibly remnants of old technology, possibly a datacore, or something like that hidden inside. i mean, this idea could be expanded on, but honestly, anything at this point is an improvement for mining.thoughts?"
11/7/2010,"the idea of a simulator has come up numerous times before. i think many of the things that you think would be great in a simulator could be organized by players, such as tournaments, races, contests, ext... there's many of these events out there now and certainly room for more. if you want a no risk/reward ever fight go check out the test server. there is a whole system on the test server setup with arena's for different ship classes and all conventional ships and fittings cost only 100 isk each. its a playground of mayhem. mining improvements have been talked about for some time, idea's about about more interesting mining sites via scanning, whole system belt mining, comet mining, planetary ring mining. the list goes on and ccp has talked about them at the most recent fanfest's. we'll see where they go. mining definitely needs love."
11/7/2010,"hmm, but honestly i would prefer it if there was a simulator, like i mentioned, where you don't need little games like races and pvp arena and such to be organized by players. i would like it if there was something like a matchmaking system, a ranking system, and etc. inside the simulator.yeah but i'd rather it just be on tranquility also. i'd rather not have to switch servers just to have this function, and i'm sure others would also like it if things were this way. see, my goal is to make mining an active experience. a lot of industrial things in the game are just start it up and wait for it to finish. i'd rather see the player take a very active part in the industrial side of eve. i have to wonder if my idea would have any effect on macro miners also... i guess what i was suggesting is more of a point and click thing where the player has different tools that he/she would need to use to extract the minerals from the asteroid. if there was something special inside, they would have to clean off a certain amount, and then gently pull the piece out, clean it off, and then put it in the cargo bay. i think things like this would make mining exponentially more enjoyable, but that's just my opinion..."
11/7/2010,"1) when changing blueprint in a processor, it should not throw out the materials to /dev/null. rather, it should either: only take the materials it needs when all of them are available or; toss them back whence they came if a route and space is available.currently changing blueprints in a p4 processor gets pretty expensive, or you have to wait an hour minimum. probably more, since you're most likely changing blueprints because some material isn't available.2) if you route two storages to the same structure, the structure should not consume double the materials as it currently does. there is no excuse for this to happen so far in the future. 3) holding <modifier key> while placing a structure snaps it as close as it can be to the structure closest to the cursor, and rotates around that when held.4) holding <some other modifier key) to place many identical structures. in every other application and game in the whole universe this is done with shift.5) higher tier items should have priority. if my processor throws in a wetware mainframe into the launchpad and it doesn't have space, surely my workforce would toss out some aquaeous liquids instead of the million-isk mainframe."
11/7/2010,"1. what it should do is kick back materials that are not required by the new print to the source of their inbound route, if space exists. if not, then they are lost.2. i don't do this, so i have no idea what you're talking about.3. yes4. yes, for the love of god.5. manage your storage better. that said - i would like to have the ability to define overflow storage as a route. so you would define another route to additional storage and only if both spots are full does the new material get tossed into the ether.in general, yes, supported."
11/7/2010,"i wouldn't be surprised if some of these things are already being worked on by ccp, because of that recent dev blog and all.generally, supported, however the one pi improvement i would like is to see actual structures on the planet instead of giant dots )"
11/7/2010,"ok. so everyone hates blob warfare. it's one of the biggest complaints i hear from people, and with good reason.it's boring.there's no tactics, no strategy, and no pilot skill required in the ""i have more ships than you!"" approach. inevitably, the smaller fleet will avoid battle at all cost rather than lose a fight they obviously can't win. nobody wants to waste their hard-earned isk on a suicide mission with no upside.another complaint i've heard involves fleet command ships. you don't see them all that often, and certainly not in roaming gangs. i don't know if it's the price, or an improperly defined role for the class, or just a lack of effectiveness for their purpose that deters their use. i'm not well versed in the complaints against them.but perhaps both problems can be solved together.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------here is what i propose: fleet 'bandwidth.'fleets would be governed by some kind of points, maybe similar to bandwidth. this 'bandwidth' would be provided from fleet command ships. you would still be able to create fleets without a command ship, but basic fleets like that would have only a certain number of 'points' and exceeding them would require you to have a fleet command ship.fleet command ships would have a certain base amount of this 'bandwidth' by default, as with drones on most ships. larger sized ships would use more of the fleet's bandwidth than smaller ones. perhaps there would be a module that would increase the amount, allowing for larger fleets controlled by a single fleet command ship.it would perhaps look something like this:standard 'gang' (no fleet command ship): 2-6 shipssmall fleet (w/ fleet command ship at default 'bandwidth'): 6-12 shipsfleet (w/ fleet command ship with boosted 'bandwidth'): 12-18 shipsagain, larger ships would need more 'points' than smaller ships, so the system would be based on those points rather than these definitive ship numbers, but something like this would hopefully be the rough end result.perhaps the command ships would have modules designating what kinds of ships they were specialized to command, like frigate/cruiser, crusier/bc, bs, capital, etc?or perhaps there would need to be several sizes of fleet command ships available, small (perhaps destroyer sized), medium, (like current command ships), large (battleship sized, for commanding battleship gangs?), and capital sized?i dunno, maybe we can take the command ships out of the idea entirely somehow?i know not all fleets conform to one size of ship. and i know this idea isn't well structured yet, but i just thought of it and i figured i'd throw it out there and get ideas from the rest of you.what do you think?"
11/7/2010,people will just work around it with multiple fleets. not sure if that is worth the effort then.
11/7/2010,paging finnagain to this thread...your ideas wont work anyway... but itll be funny to watch finnagain lose his nut about it...
11/7/2010,the only people complaining are the ones who don't know how to make friend to help them fight that other gang that actually has a group of friends.
11/7/2010,pretending to have friends isnt the same as actually having them...and i know saying that on an internet spaceship game online is going to get me lynched... but its out there now.
11/7/2010,"fleet command ships arent used anymore because the t3 cruisers give better bonuses, and are immune to bubbles.as far as your idea goes, it might help in some very specific scenarios involving small gangs, but even in those there are ways to work around it. wouldnt help much except hurting small gangs in the long run."
11/7/2010,you want some cheese wit dat?
11/7/2010,"the ""i have more men than you"" approach to warfare and conquest is part of human nature. people fight to win, and unless there is some unrealistic cap or ""arena"" style battles, people will always try to bring more however they can. if you make some kind of mechanic, people will just work around it by making extra fleets, having neutral reppers, etc. eventually you will have to rework the entire game in order to stop the ""blob"" and then it won't be eve anymore.you could say a ""blob"" has no strategy, but i disagree. for one, it requires recruiting, and effort to assemble the blob, get everyone in the right shiptypes, etc. when the blobs clash, it isn't some mindless random shooting all over the place. the winner is still decided based on a good plan and tactics."
11/7/2010,"actually this technique has almost never worked over the past several hundred years, in rl theres alot of factors, huge armies have crumbled when leaders were assassinated, revolutions caused empires to crumble, historically having more numbers has almost never played a huge part in winning.take rl current wars for example, despite blobbing certain countries there has been practically zero improvement / change.human nature may want to win but theres been so little evidence over the past to show that blobbing works in real life as well as it does in eve, even in the animal kingdom blobbing isnt a permo win as it is in eve. removing standings wont have a work around unless alliances just put everything in one alliance and even then it would require a huge amount of messing around to fix, risks would be involved, since alliances will only see themselves as blue having neutral reppers wont change anything.clearly you havent read ncs guide to strategy, i dont see how putting everyone online in one system just to crash the enemy is strategy.also their recruitment, check nc ads, they pretty much invite everyone in."
11/7/2010,"given equal technology of 2 sides, the only difference that can have an effect on the outcome of the battle is having more men, or better tactics. having both is even better still. real life wars wars are different because most of the time both sides do not have the same technology available to them, and natural resources are not infinite and evenly spread out like they are in eve.you can still change overview to see the alliance ticker on the ships. pretty much all you have to do is have a list of tickers that are friendly.funny how everyone whines about the nc, when there are other large groups out there.. it and friends for example. people band together to form larger/more powerful groups to provide mutual safety against perceived threats. and of course if a group wants to become a threat, they will have to be powerful enough to overcome their enemies.as for inviting anyone in, well besides the obvious spy issues, its a game and i don't see an issue with allowing people to play it."
11/7/2010,"you live in another universe with an alternate history?look what happened in the urss during wwii. better trained army with superior tactics and better applied technology in several fields (germans) vs larger numbers (russians). it ended badly for the germans. there were a lot of other factors, but numbers had a large impact. it was the same for most of know history. superiority in numbers count a lot."
11/7/2010,fyp
11/7/2010,"exactly. pretty much the only cases where overwhelming numbers haven't provided a winning advantage are those were overwhelming technological superiority applied. back in the days of 2005 where there were only a small percentage of players could both use and afford fully t2 fit sniper bc, hacs, etc. then smaller numbered fleets could and did successfully engage large fleets.now the guys that were getting worked over by those fleets in 2006 can all fly and easily afford hacs, capitals and so forth, and the technology gap is significantly narrowed. therefore it becomes about numbers.the people bawwing about ""the blob"" being ""so unfair"" are really just bawwing about the good old days when they could do the eve equivalent of mowing down 12000 tribesmen with a couple of dozen maxims, and then back to camp for tea and medals all round. now they have to engage the ""noobs"" on a relatively level playing field; oh deary me how awful for you lord and ladies to find out that you aren't really all that much better than those dreadful common natives at all when they have maxim guns too, and there are still 12000 of them.adapt or die. get over it."
11/7/2010,"glad you mentioned why rl wars is different in game, we have progress, also this isnt nc vs it, sc no longer exists and it has 6k+ people i would hardly say that is anything close to ncs 60k+ peopleas for the other guy giving 2 lines of examples ironically missing out ""germans attacking / conquering france with ease despite englands allegiance to france"" clearly you read to read up on wwii and how and why countries succeeded and failed in alot of stuff.this game isnt rl and will never be, rl is far more political, strategic and requires alot more than ""get everyone in the same system and they wont have a chance"".also ccp changed titan dd because everyone whined about pl hot dropping, a small alliance that successfully hot dropped to the point where in delve war ii them and nc made a point by dd'ing a cap.my point is, dd was changed because of how it ruined 0.0, (even though i didnt see dd being a problem).the reason the nap whines has increased is because the second there was a hope of fixing lag nc blobbed a system alone with 2200 players of their own, baring in mind 50% of nc were busy else where, the outcome was lag again, alliances are now either forced to nap everyone in 50 jumps to even have a chance against nc and any decent alliance hates having such a ******ly huge nap list. why?! because they want combat, they went to 0.0 for combat and not to blob.fixing this blobbing thing benefits everyone that doesnt hugely depend on nap warfare, the only reason nc and nc alts are in panic mode is because its their only strategy, if this wasnt the case they would openly welcome nap changes (like vuk lau promised many many times) and changes to blobbing.but until ccp change the mechanics on 0.0 to benefits smaller wars, smaller alliances and actually promote combat all you will see is lag node crashes and naps while players will leave 0.0 and either quit or stay in empire.oh and lag doesnt happen in rl so unless you can show me an example on how 'human nature' is to blob a place cause lag and win a fight i really dont think you can compare eve to rl."
11/7/2010,"edit- oh look a dreadlord deceived me by editting my post :shocking:as for you agreeing to rl wars, i really dont want to have to link everything over the past 1000 years on how certain battles / wars were won and not because of blobbing."
11/7/2010,"the point you missed, was that in eve everyone has access to the same resources and the same technology. therefore the battles are reduced to tactics and numbers. therefore a group will be motivated to get as large of a force as they can.and i think your numbers are quite a bit off.. lol.. 60k people"
11/7/2010,"i put stats up month ago, heres an easy way to work out who is part of nc and what numbers.click alliance tab (in corp) click ranking, majority of those top populated alliances (i think only 2 arent) are part of nc and that list goes on and on.it worked out 50k 2 months ago but hey dont take my word for it, you have all the info in game add it up yourself."
11/7/2010,it is funny that half of the people that are posting here are actualy useless alts that contribute nothing exept trolling. i dont know if the commandship is a good idea. it will turn out to be more of a hassle than anything else. the only solution so far vs blobbing is gurilia tactic's. small fleets (5-12) with a dictor few recons (rapier/falcon) and nano ships. if they bring the blob just run or logofski. a good scout is essential as that defines movement speed u need to stay ahead of the blob. u can still gank stuff/ bubble stations and they can not do anything. this do require experiance people.
11/7/2010,"i will actually pay 1 mill isk to the person who can provide a solution to blobs that actually works, without it either making the game ludicrously complex or actually just making blobs better."
11/7/2010,"during the invasion of france the german used the blitzkrieg tactic to get local superiority. i.e. they still used superiority in number and armaments. the allied forces were locked in outdated tactics and had little mobility, so even if they had larger numbers (but not by a so large margin) they were unable to use them.to cite another example:i can go on for several hundred of pages of examples. numbers count a lot."
11/7/2010,"for trolls sake i present you the case of finland vs cccp.for the actual idea; i disagree. i don't disagree with the actual issue but i disagree with the solution. i file this on the same with ""diminished damage per shooter vs one target"", just say no.problems that i'd foresee is, beside the neutral / multigang abuse, that it would bring more trouble to the mid-sized alliances, than it would to the truly big ones; in terms of skilled pilots / possible gang leaders.well, if this isn't the case correct me, but i still can find more downsides / abuses than what it would actually bring."
11/7/2010,"this thread derailed in such a weird way, however with you we can go at it all day, i can mention how napoleon got owned even after outnumbering the russians in the invasion of russia and how bad weather was a major problem for battles such as the spanish invasion as well as alot of battles / wars etc but since we are on the topic of wars why not look at stuff with a little more skill / equal numbers like 1066 battle of hastings, it is really difficult comparing rl to eveeitherway it doesnt change the fact that blobs in eve cause lag and coalitions main strategy is to put everything in one system to cause lag for enemies jumping in which eventually kills the node.this isnt rl and while i appreciate the technology / numbers comment the reasons for blobbing are much different in eve and lets not forget ccp wanted smaller alliances to move to 0.0 (through dominion), not only that wars in rl do massive destruction in eve the only things affected are ships items and morale, we arent even allowed to destroy stations, accel gates etc in eve making it hard to be strategici dont really think it is a good idea comparing a spaceship game to rl, especially when theres so many rl factors to take into account, like death, resources (in eve things respawn like asteroid belts), food upkeep for troops etc.if people want this like rl then ccp should change everything, make it so everything can be destroyed / built, how food / death play a major part to outcomes of battles and introduce super weapons that can cause much destruction like hiroshima ;)edit - oh and it really depends on what you are saying about 'numbers counting alot', yes numbers do which is exactly why things need to be changed in game to either make it more like rl or more skill based and not number based, you cant have it both ways; this is the point most of the anti-blob people try to get across"
11/7/2010,comparing eve to rl = fail.
11/7/2010,"simples,if the objective of alliance a is to take a system of alliance b currently alliance a's best bet is to send as many dudes as they can in a big blob. alliance b's best bet to stop them is to put together an at least equal or preferably bigger blob in the system to counter.this leads to a dynamic where alliances are constantly trying trying to engineer bigger blobs untill the servers explode.to reduce blob size you need to engineer objectives which mean alliance a has to split their fleet to hit them all across multiple systems and alliance b has to split their fleet to defend.something like systems a & b is impossible to take down unless you take some ______ generator in either system c or d.in contrast small gangs do nothing ... you can roam some systems, end some ships, but nothing that would really hurt a big alliance.so add something to sov systems without 00000000000000000000000's of hp for small gangs to blowup."
11/7/2010,"how about randomly banning every other account? but yeah, the obvious answer would prolly be to bring back area-effect dd... not that this won't lead to other issues in its wake..."
11/7/2010,1 giga blob-> 10 mega blobsconfirming this idea will not help.
11/7/2010,"this has merit. as long as the objective is singular, then the blob will rule. and when talking about system conquest, the system is the objective. so, yea. and clearly, spreading the attackers out within a given star system isn't really effective, as they'd just wipe out the defense force, then go after the objectives. maybe control of both sides of the gates into the system, or something similar is needed? thus, even when it's a dead end system with only one gate, the attacking force still has to take objectives in two systems. then a given blob is divided among different systems, thus reducing potential to kill the node, and suggesting a different fleet make up depending on the specific objective. fleet a needs to defend, fleet b is on offense, etc."
11/7/2010,simply trying to limit the size of blobs will not work. there must be a viable objective for smaller fleets and a benefit/incentive to split up forces. i have some ideas in the thread bellow for creating meaningful small gang objectives in sov warfare and alternatives to the toe to toe blob vs blob lagfest standoffs that dominate it currently.
11/7/2010,"i like both of your ideas. a combination of the two ideas would go a long way to making combat in 0.0 more interesting. the more i think about it, the more it makes more sense to give people incentives to go with smaller numbers rather than penalize larger numbers. people don't try to work around incentives.maybe there could be some way to make smaller numbers more 'stealthy' while making larger fleets more 'visible?' small groups of ships could perhaps move nearly undetected through enemy territory, while larger ships could be 'heard' coming from a 'mile' away?say your ratting, and a 30 man enemy gang is rolling down the pipe toward you. could there be some sort of 'perimeter alarm' that larger gangs would trigger, and smaller gangs would slip through without notice? perhaps it would count the total mass of the gang, rather than number of ships."
11/7/2010,"the current system of accepting and completing agent missions is both archaic and inefficient.current system [cons]1. requires traveling back and forth between agent and mission space. this causes unnecessary repetitive clicking, server and network load.2. wastes valuable player time. for mission runners, time is money.3. archaic. the requirement for traveling back and forth between the agent and mission only applies in games where the time period or setting is not futuristic. since eve is set in the future with advanced technologies, it only makes sense that all communication is done via satellite.proposed solution:--------------------------1. only require traveling to the agent to accept the initial mission. subsequent missions that are accepted and turned in from the same agent can be done from any location remotely.2. missions where an item is needed to be acquired can be turned in upon completion of the mission from any location remotely, as long as the required item is inside the player's ship cargo hold.3. for missions that require transport of goods from point a to point b, the goods will be placed in the player's ship cargo hold upon mission acceptance, no matter where the player is located. upon delivery of the goods, the mission can be turned in remotely.--------------------------these changes will alleviate some of the repetitiveness from running missions, help streamline game play, and reduce network traffic and server load.in addition, it will help reduce the over-crowding of mission hubs since players can base their operations anywhere. this includes use of an orca or carrier as a mobile base, where ship fitting changes can be done in space.this will benefit everyone including pvp players since they also run missions to fund their activities.if you agree that this proposal will enhance game play and be beneficial to you, i encourage you to send a proposal to ccp today."
11/7/2010,"1. seems fair enough.2. no. while it is reasonable to expect remote communication, when an agent wants an item brought to them, they don't want it 17 jumps from where they are. would you accept a courier contract as completed when the courier drops it off in torrinos and you're in rens? mission items should have to be returned to the agent's location.3. no, similar to above. having the transport goods put into the cargo hold seems fine, so long as the player's ship is at the point a station.same with remotely turning in the mission. it would just be cleaner if the mission can be accepted from anywhere (as in 1.), and completed from anywhere, but the goods are placed in the players hangar in point a station, and must be either in the player's point b station hangar or their ship's cargo hold with their ship docked at point b station for hand in.yes, some travel/time/effort would be required but that is the whole point. yes, time is money for mission runners, so they need to expend some to make their money. the more efficiently they as players can do it the better."
11/7/2010,"issues: 1: relatively few 0.0 systems are inahabited or used to their full potential2: server stability fluctuates with increasing numbers in ""giant"" wars (when 7-8 regions worth of players are crammed into one system)3: stagnancy of 0.0 warefare - long siege times / low chance of engagements that are playable4. evasion of consequencessolution:hate to be blunt yall... but complete removal of standings system would solve nearly every major 0.0 issue we are having with this game...how would it solve these issues:1. almost complete shattering of coalition system (likely that nips could still be used) - this would severely draw back the ability of 0.0 alliances to hold lots of space - obviously this would lead to more alliances being able to get a foothold in 0.0 and hopefully more people coming out into 0.02. far less likely to encounter server issues on a regular basis(being people from over half of eve converging on the one system to sit there lagged out for hours)3. weaker alliances may leed to more powershifting and a more dynamic 0.0 map, which again would allow more people to see more of eve - will also leed to more instances of battles for both small roaming gangs and large fleet fights looking to invade etc.4. use of alts to evade consequences/derive benefits would be stopped by such a thing obviously. bringing importance to choice of alliance / corp.problems: no one from a coalition that is benefiting from these standings is going to come along willingly. but i know finnagain would want me to tell you all to man up and adapt or die...(its a difficult task to convinse people that they would be better off in such an eve - particularly as they have experianced little but this sort of game.)random thoughts: uncertain why standings should have been included in the game to begin with, as both coalitions and alliances enable you to derive benefits. allowing standings is simply a way to circumvent any consequences of having to be in the same alliance. my thoughts are if people want to work together, they have to be capable of holding it together. further, at current being blue to another entity is essentially meaningless, it has nothing to do with friendship/liking we have seen leaders of alliances blue alliances whom they have aledgedly hated for mutal protection.interestingly enough i dont believe that a removal of standings would at all cheapen the politics of eve, it might in fact enhance it. instead of meaningless conversations essentially of ""are you scared of being invaded?"" ""yes, are you?"" ""yes... lets be friends..."" it might turn into something far more complex and delicate. something like nips or mutual invasion pacts, ie ""if im invaded you invade my invader"" etc. such a change could liven up areas of this game which have been relatively dormant. unforseen issues: if something like this is done, we could be surprised by the desperation of certain entites, and perhaps there could be similar issues if super alliances are formed, however it is my belief that it is far more difficult to maintain a 10k man alliance than 10 individual 1k man alliances. so perhaps it wouldnt be an issue but if we end up with two alliances holding the entire of 0.0 again... then i guess looking into other limitation options is also wise."
11/7/2010,"let me be first to say no, will edit later :pso what happens when standings would be removed? the allies are gonna fill up with members till they have a super ally which could do the same like the actual coalitions, maybe a little smaller but you could still do the same.how would you defend against such a super ally? cry till ccp cuts down the maximum of members an ally can hold?"
11/7/2010,"well two things,firstly, i think its much harder to try and get everyone to fold into one giant coalition because of things like pride, arrogance, mistrust etc etc, also i think once such a large ""formal"" alliance is made there would be significant internal struggles simply with the size. having too much isnt always good for you.aside from this i think if your only real argument is that, i cant see how it will be any worse than what the game is like now... so why isnt it worth the try?also supportin mah own thread, dont get me wrong i doubt this change will ever be made, but i can hope. and i dont want to give up faith in ccp just yet!"
11/7/2010,supportednerf the nc i mean coalitions
11/7/2010,because it's completely impossible to meta this whole thing... or form a super-alliance.
11/7/2010,how about no.. standings are used for a lot more than just 0.0 mega alliance formation.. even small corps and individuals use them for various things.
11/7/2010,"excellent idea but if this is introduced you will definitely need an alliance player cap because nc nap abusers will most likely put all their previous naps in their alliance.however this idea is brilliant it will finally allow skill to hold space rather than blobbing, it will also mean lag will only have to be fixed to counter at best a 12k battle (assuming 2 alliances capped go at it with every member online).it involves nice risk / reward but i think nrds alliances wont be too happy with the change.0.0 will become populated, with alliances craving blood no longer will naps prevent the outcome of a battle, alliances will have to decide which 'friend' is worth having and which 'isnt'.smaller alliances will now have a chance in 0.0outcome eitherway will be more pvp, more activity and most of all more lagg free battles!!mini, you should apply to csm your ideas actually will help eve unlike certain nap abusing hypocrites"
11/7/2010,"i think that removing standings from the game is probably the wrong way to go if you want a dynamic environment where borders change on a regular basis. unfortunately you're right in the respect that if standings are removed then most of the coalitions will just merge into even larger, more static, alliances and no real changes will occur except the further damaging of smaller alliances which are already pretty much relegated to becoming renters, pets or guerrilla alliances if they want to inhabit 0.0 with no real options for taking space on their own.instead i'd like to see standings severely nerfed. introduce real penalties and benefits for setting other entities blue or red (not a hard cap either because that has literally never ended well) and get rid of this stupid sov infrastructure system and static anoms.most of all for the love of god stop treating each system as an isolated unit of sov and instead start treating sov over all owned systems as a single entity being generated from a central hq system and systems that are being used for carebearing.the best way to nerf these supercoalitions is to reintroduce resource scarcity and give supercoalitions reasons to fight internally. then make legitimate ways for smaller pvp oriented alliances to have some sort of real effect against spaceholding alliances and their sov."
11/7/2010,"you will never be rid of supergroups, one way or another they will show up. it is human nature. this thread just looks like an attempt to get people to change mechanics because you cannot deal with it. removing standing is a good idea, but it will create mega alliances, fragile ones, but they will happen, and continue to do so as you guys keep forgetting about the industrial side of this game. who is gonna protect the people making you ships?currently the market is well fed from having safe supply routes throughout space. the market would take a large hit if these lines suddenly died, causing you all to lose wealth fast as your want for more pvp empties your wallets from ship prices suddenly spiking and more losses than you are adjusted to.i will agree it is nice thought to be able to have more groups, be able to fight smaller battles. one i can atest to as yea, i'm with the nc and no those lag battles are not fun.but this all looks like a way to get the game mechanics changed because you're losing, so find another way. politics aside, i however do like the idea of a consequence system on standings.-sephixan"
11/7/2010,"yeh red vs blue is very interested in taking your space, look out everyone!the reason people always assume i cant hack losing is because they assume (and poorly so) that they are winning.wake up to yourselves.speeking of being unable to deal with it: sephixan > you're right, standings wouldn't be pulled out, and if they were, and when my predictions come true, i'll just quit the game because the one thing i love about it is goneedit: after further conversation it boiled down to this... sephixan > k how do you get minerals from null sec to jita in your hundreds of unallied groups?apparently the reason coalitions need to exist is to that we can move minerals too and from empire in safety. brilliant."
11/7/2010,"i wish people wouldnt keep saying human nature, first of all 'human nature' alone covers several theories all which down the line go against each other and is broken down in alot of areas from psychology to philosophy which in the end are all theories.while i am fond of psychology and understand the importance of analysing and understanding stuff, i wouldnt and neither would any person simply reply ""because of human nature"", you may as well reply ""people blob because"".blobbing through survivability can be down to a **** load of stuff, dependency and ego come to mindnode crashing via blobbing can be down to alot of things like opportunity and dependency.seriously which ever dumbass made it openly acceptable to allow people to say ""because of human nature"" really needs to go study psychology.because guess what xxx does yyy because of human nature can apply to everything thanks to how vague the statement is, at least back it up oh and for the record, survivability plays a part in nature but even so if your logic is going to promote blobbing because it is natural then minigins idea should go ahead because it is naturalthis is what happens when people get their education from tv <sigh>"
11/7/2010,"the point is.. regardless of if you remove the feature to have colors to show who you like, and who you don't. people will still have friends and enemies, so nothing will change. they will simply work around the inconvenience.no-one would have a blue today, and then when standings are removed, suddenly go ""oh well.. since the game doesn't let me put a blue + next to your name now you are my enemy"" lol. instead they would say ""ok since we are friends and ccp were idiots to remove a useful feature of the game, how can we organize ourselves so we don't have friendly fire""."
11/7/2010,"never before seen such an effective method of removing the chance for small groups to ever be active in 0.0. blob warfare should be prevented by game mechanics, not by stupid limitations and making the ui worse. make travel slower -> less blob warfare."
11/7/2010,"well minigin, i think the issue list you compiled is valid, but i'm in agreement with furb:"
11/7/2010,"making conventional travel slower is a terrible, terrible idea. nerfing jump bridges however, is a very good idea"
11/7/2010,i believe that's what he meant.
11/7/2010,"pretty much everything with jump in the name: jump bridges, jump drives, jump clones, etc (no not jump gates). normal travel definately does not need to be slower."
11/7/2010,"your proposal is utterly stupid and full of fail.just because you feel removal of a game mechanic will fix things doesn't mean it will.we have these things called internets.... and social networking.what in the frakking hell prevents us from coming up with our own standings system?seriously... i suggest you take a step back from the gaming world and get a taste of reality again before you start banging your ""anti-coalition"" drum.if you want more targets... then don't blue anyone and red everyone... you have plenty of targets to shoot at that point.no one said you had to use it.ps: besides...everyone knows that these newfangled coalitions don't really work as well as they do... its a political game with promises and eventually turn out to be false anyway. just take a gander at the coad... oh wait... your from there.... never mind.it's really just blob insurance... but in reality its just mutually assured destruction... pay me rent and i back you up... and in reality they are just in it for their own agenda.ps2: honestly... you can't prevent blob warfare... so... fix the lag... so blob warfare becomes epic and smooth connection wise... if anything you get a nice movie."
11/7/2010,"ccp made a huge improvement on lag and what was the first thing you saw, nc bring in more people to bring back lag, this has been the same thing thats happened over the past several years and will continue toplayers blob and create lagplayers whineccp fixes lagsee what the problem here is, ccp could change it so 500k people are allowed in one system lag free but eventually the same problem will happen.so imagine this scenario600k nc vs 100k while all smaller alliances have max maybe 10k members.see what the real problem is? because unless the mechanics are changed, smaller alliances wont stand a chance in 0.0 and the only strategy will be to blob, mass naping and blobbing only encourages other alliances todo the same killing small gang warfarecant wait to see 550k titans on a killmail"
11/7/2010,"i like what you are trying to do mini, but i have to disagree on the effectiveness of the method. and that last line is partly why. people are going to find a way to adapt to the restrictions. the baseline mechanics of combat and sov present no benefit to split forces or fight in smaller force.the problem of blobs needs to be addressed there first. trying to place artificial limits on the size of gangs that an entity can field will not hold. people will find a way adapt because there is a incentive to do so. here is an idea i had brought up for discussion before, but cannot find the thread. if we want to reduce the blob we need two things. reduce the effectiveness of blob to provide incentive for splitting the force.give smaller forces a meaningful objective in sov. in your other thread on bridges we talked a little about changing sov mechanics to give small gang objectives so i'll leave that over there. but we also need to reduce the effectiveness of the blog force to provide an incentive for splitting the force, otherwise they will just blob one objective after the other. attacking them separately with smaller forces has to in some way be more effective. eve is a game of diminishing returns, yet the power of a large fleet to direct their fire on a single target in undiminished over numbers (at least until the server starts to lag).if there where some limitation of the effectiveness of a larger gang to all target individual members of a smaller gang we could see much more fluid and dynamic fleet fights. imagine that if only so many ships could affectively lock a vessel ( a function of signature radius vs scan resolution ) we would have a situation where ships where encouraged to primary their most effective target class and not all lump damage onto one primary as a fleet."
11/7/2010,real men don't need blues...

11/7/2010,you forgot the op.
11/7/2010,"i've never known a use for the size column, replace it with signature radius. no net lag increase :)"
11/7/2010,"sup hookers? how about a t2 small tractor beamz? stats: same tractor beam reach 20k (un-bonused) tractor speed= 900m/sec i think the standard beam speed is around 550m/sec give or take. ----------------------------------------------------------------faction small beam thingy. slight tractor beam reach increase, i'm guessing 25k versus 20k maybe increased tractor speed. -------------------------------that is all...i am a troll !!!11!!!"
11/7/2010,"i'm all for it, but i think a t2 version should get at least a 5k boost to distance along with speed."
11/7/2010,settle down!!!
11/7/2010,"just speed is kind of meh.range increase too please. 25km t2, 30km faction/named? if that's too high 22km t2, 25km faction/named.-or-there are medium and large tractor beams in the static database dump. medium has a 40km range and large has an 80km range. they all have a 500m/s speed. these seem acceptable, why not release these? then t2 could have only a faster speed since range would be based on size. faction would not be needed in this case."
11/7/2010,"i approve of the idea but think it's not really necessary, with marauders, orca and soon the noctis giving bonuses to tractors."
11/7/2010,"yes, moar t2 needed :)"
11/7/2010,additional t2 required
11/7/2010,and all t3 cruisers with emergent locus analyzer subsystem
11/7/2010,"i can understand your point of view, but i can't help but think every item should have at least one t2 variant available if for no other reason than to add more choice. admittedly, the noctis' huge tractor boost is going to change things, but not everyone is going to want to fly one. marauders are nice but not for everyone and orca's have their bonus for a good reason and salvaging isn't it.the majority of people will still place single or dual tractors on their mission and ratting ships and this is something for them."
11/7/2010,"i fully support the development of the api feature as long as we are able to choose what data can be sent out from our keys.however, i do not support the idea of write access, mainly because this serves two potental issues (as mentioned by other posters in this thread).1. server load my become unbearable2. major security risk"
11/7/2010,"i thought of an idea a while back that would be a secondary training cue. it would take 10 times the time to train the skill (instead of 9 days it would take 90). this would be a way to train for a secondary ship, extremely slowly, while working on a primary ship just like your normally would."
11/7/2010,"you obviously do not ""get"" eve. that's ok, not everyone does. please don't screw it up for the rest of us with inane ideas like these though.my guess is no."
11/7/2010,you've been playing since july and you have the tenacity to dare propose a change?
11/7/2010,"i think the word you're looking for is 'audacity.' back on topic, long skill training times in eve are absolutely essential to the game. it's the wall that keeps out most of the rabble. the bouncer at the front door of the club if you will. people who stick with eve tend to be more intelligent and mature than other games playerbases.everyone has to go through the rough first year, and new players will just have to suck it up and endure like we all did. the wait is worth it."
11/7/2010,"overall, no.but you did have two things in there that aren't bad:* allow players to queue up a skill that they cannot train until that point in the queue - yes please.* double training speed for newbies - we already have this - and we're about to make it roughly quadruple with the commissioned officer edition that's being released soon (already?)the rest of your post shows a lack of understanding of eve. everything is possible, if you work for it. you can do anything, but be prepared to be patient, and to accept the consequences if you choose poorly.*double skill training - ie: double training speed? the game is not supposed to be fast.*expanding the training queue to a week/month - it isn't very difficult to log in for 5 minutes per day, surely. and if you only want to change your skills, you're doing it wrong.*taking too long to get into the game - i am a member of eve university (look us up) - we can get newbies into useful roles in a fleet fight in less time than it takes to get them into the class that explains *how* to use the skills they've trained. you can be a useful tackler within hours of creating a character. you can be a useful ecm pilot within a couple of days. find some friends, fly with them, and realise that there is no invisible barrier to the game before x months of training. you can play today."

11/7/2010,"i agree, i posted a similar question earlier.this graphics problem of trying to make the buildings look the same size should not affect the distance between the buildings.i want a petition to change this affect. how do you do that?this problem seems to affect gas planets more then others. perhaps the gas command centers need to have extra powergrid to account for this graphics problem.i can't understand why they would let this graphics issues affect the placement of the buildings in the first place. why cant do they put in some kind of internal calculation that accounts for this?"
11/7/2010,"dear ccp: it isn't fair that people can choose a way of playing eve which differs from my own. the nc are mean and have alot of people, its not fair teams. also, allowing player-driven interaction is surely against the rules, ccp should introduce more railroading, and stop people from playing this open ended sandbox mmo in the wrong way.please nerf everyone who isn't me or i will sulk in the corner and stamp my feet."

11/7/2010,as much as i applaud you intentions navigator you know as well as i do and many others that flames and trolls occur everywhere on the forums which are only lightly moderated (some entities seem to have more of a carte blanche than others imo)however as you seem to be speaking more about this particular sub forum i believe you maybe hitting your head against a brickwall mainly for 2 reasons;1) its political2) the description of the forum seems to give a sort of free reign to the topics and discussion in comparison to the other forums;'a less formal venue to discuss or debate whatever you wish regarding the council of stellar management.'but i wish you luck anyway
11/7/2010,"hm, don't forum rules state that moderation is not to be discussed? time to grant the forums mods their wish and file a report..."
11/7/2010,"neresky,although technically you are discussing moderation i would like to point out that because it is a less formal venue to discuss whatever you wish, this does not mean that the regular forum rules do not apply. the point of these sub forums are to have spirited discussions regarding issues that you would like the csm to raise directly with us at ccp. if that thread is nothing more than two or three players holding a grudge at each other and posting flames or trolls then important messaging can get lost in that crossfire.i can tell you that the csm work hard to bring forward solid player ideas and we would rather see good ideas having a solid discussion so that the csm can get a broad feel of what players want."
11/7/2010,"didnt mean to cause offence, was just making a statement and technically i wasnt discussing moderation but wishing you luck in your endeavours.apologies offered if offence was caused"
11/7/2010,"the problem is, some players really do want to find ways out of game (e.g. through the forums) to beat opponents who they cannot beat in game. it's corporation-alliance-and-organization discussion masquerading as non-caod discussion. it's like if we saw dozens of threads from nc pilots complaining about the effectiveness of drone regions' drake fleets, and a dozen variations on ""nerf drake tank!"" ""no, nerf drake's ability to get remote reps!"" ""no, nerf drake pilots and anybody who flies a drake loses 1 mil skillpoints on destruction!"" we're seeing the same sort of thing now ""remove pilots abilities to tell who's blue and who isn't!"", ""don't let fleets use allied jump bridges, titans, or black ops!"" and so on and so on and so on. it's caod masquerading as game mechanics fixes. more importantly, the whole concept of ""blob"" this or ""blob"" that is 100% meaningless, other than to indicate that it's being used as a snarl word by someone. honestly, there is simply no objective definition of the word ""blob"" that doesn't rely, exclusively, on a whine that someone is able to bring more forces than you are. is a 100 man gang a blob? well, not if the defenders have 200 pilots. but what if that 100 man gang is fighting 2 people, is it a blob then? if the 100 man fleet jumps out from a system where it can't fight 200 people and then fights 2 people, is it suddenly not a blob in one system and a blob in the next, even though the actual fleet hasn't changed, at all? is a 50:50 fight fair? what if one side brings all supercarriers and the other has battlecruisers, is it a supercarrier ""blob"" then? obviously, it's not about how many people you bring, but what the opposition has. and that means that the only real definition of the snarl word is a subjective complaint that someone else can have more people in the game than you do and/or that they have better ships. which is, of course, game mechanics functioning exactly as intended. and it does miss the fundamental dynamic behind eve, which is that in lawless space players are the ones who decide how the game plays out because it's player-driven interactions that set up the market, determine the resources available, determine what empires exist where, etc... the desire for a game with artificial ""fairness"" (i.e. a game where nobody can bring more people or have better equipment than you can) is simply not eve. but it is, essentially, what games like world of warcraft have built in. not only should eve not try to emulate the softest aspects of wow, but arguments about how people shouldn't be allowed to bring more/better ships than others, or how only one playstyle should be boosted (e.g. small gang) at the expense of tens of thousands of other players because some small-gang advocates can't adapt and/or they want to be able to refrain from adapting and still be able to challenge those who can offer superior force/numbers... well, it's an attempt to sneak in-game conflicts through the back door as if they were some sort of necessary game-mechanics fix. ""i can't figure out a way to counter significantly greater force/numbers and i refuse to find a niche where that isn't necessary."" is not a valid topic of discussion, it's a blog post."
11/7/2010,"you are doing it again finn, dont you get it your argument can be used for every change in progress, completed or suggested, things change for a reason, as far as your replies have gone you have gone and truly in short said ""ccp except for bugs i dont wish for any change in this game ever"" and because you are so vague, yet you brand yourself as sincere and whatever you say you believe to be accurate without listening to anyone.i cant be doing with your inconsistence or ignorance anymore, say what you like, i will continue as i am but refuse to even acknowledge your existence even in game and considering how many arguments you get into daily i would be surprised if i am the first one to say this"

11/8/2010,"i believe that the black ops should be able to bridge all t2 crusier sized ships.recon or not,alsoi believe that all the bo should get a standard bounes to bridging -10% fuel need per skill black op lvl instead of the jump portal skill.i also think the jump range should be a bit longer and covert cynos should be able to be lit anywhere in empire aswell,i also think that the black op should be able use a covert ops cloak,also change the jump portal skill prereq to something other than a probing skill.i think the prereqs should be electronics lvl 5,bs lvl 5, jump cal lvl 4,scenice lvl 5,black op lvl 1,covert jump portal lvl 1 (note this should be a seprate skills book asdie from the jump portal,these prereqs are for the covert jump portal only).but i think there should be a covert cyno jammer as well for system that have sov lvl 5 for more than 5 months.but thats my idea for the black op."
11/8/2010,it should have went without saying.
11/8/2010,if your right and the wolf is the mini vaga that is really sad that the wolf is actually slower than the vaga.
11/8/2010,i also agree with this. give tracking a little bit of a boost so its between acs and pls. make the ships a little bit faster and call it good. also some more cap would be nice on the ships designed to active tank. either that or change the bonus to +5% ris per skill. could some one write up a proposal and start a new thread or get a csm to look at this. i get off of work in 13 mins and don't have the time right now. i hope we can find a way to get this problem fixed soon. does the csm have any ideas on this topic? i have read your logs and i know you have talked to ccp about it in the past but we need to keep on them about it. hybrids sucking is affecting 1/2 of the races in the game. if you want to salve problems with eve please make this a must for ccp to fix in the summer expantion.
11/8/2010,"the csm has shown absolutely no interest in fixing hybrids or the gallente faction, and i've never read any indication that any of them have even paid attention to these threads.if you notice, it wasn't even listed on the crowdsource csm issues to vote on!in other words, csm fail gal/hybrid users and need to pay attention."
11/8/2010,csm have got this issue on their (very long) list of fixes. however prioritisation is low and they suggested an increase in range nevermind eh? maybe someone somewhere in ccp is working on it and has a very good intuitive fix in the secret back store
11/8/2010,"i daresay rails need something to compensate for the fact that they require both capacitor to fire and ammo (and can't insta-switch), they need a distinct advantage over lasers and projectiles, and right now there's none.they can't change damage typedps output is poor to middlingalpha is nonexistentthe entire medium rail line is a jokerange is slightly longer, which doesn't make a difference in mediums, and makes no difference past 150+km when enemies can just warp to your wrecks.oh well, i get my zealot in a week, so i won't have to bother with em soon enough."

11/8/2010,rails could use some love
11/8/2010,yes!it's about time they invest in the core of the game and not features that the majority don't want anyway.
11/8/2010,sounds sweet.
11/8/2010,"/signed, definitely something i can get behind."
11/8/2010,this would be very nice.

11/8/2010,"there is general consensus that hybrids are weedy. however, for a number of reasons, previous proposals did not pass. i suggest we figure out what we need, and finally get hybrids fixed.content of this post may be modified as the discussion goes on, in order to reflect the conclusion our community will (hopefully) come to. i would like everybody replying to this post to agree or disagree with each point separately. the issue with hybrids today is that they tend to combine the shortcomings of all weapon systems, rather than their strengths: i.e. neut vulnerability, need for ammunition, etc. 1 the most bizarre aspect of hybrids to me, is the larger ammunition size. all hybrid charges are twice as large as their projectile counterparts. there are two reasons why this is wrong:the ship firing hybrid charges has to expend its capacitor energy to do so. that means it will need more capacitor booster charges and have to carry larger hybrid ammo. overall this will result in lower durability of hybrid platforms. rail guns have higher rate of fire than artillery canons. that mean they will chew through more ammo during an engagement, and since this ammo is larger, their durability suffers yet again.in the difference of projectile ammunition, hybrid charges are simply chunks of metal, containing no propellant. their calibre is also much smaller  425mm against 1400mm. assuming that the bullet length is the same (which it isnt) hybrid charges should be at least 10 times smaller in volume then their projectile counterparts, without the propellant. conclusion: size of hybrid ammunition needs to be greatly reduced.2 to give hybrids an extra edge, reloading time could be reduced from 10 seconds to, say, 5 seconds. that makes hybrids tactically more flexible. lower reloading time could be justified by smaller size of ammunition. 3 blasters have range several times shorter than that of projectiles, yet their tracking is the same. they have the lowest relative taking at their range. this tracking should be improved. 4 null ammo is the worst of all t2 long-range ammunitions. 25% bonus to optimal and falloff is substantially worse than 50% bonus to optimal scorch gets. to make them equal, null should get 37.5% to 40% bonus to optima and falloff. if someone doubts this, i will be glad to give you the numbers. 5referring to this topic, where author gave every weapon system a score. although arbitrary by nature, it reflects the situation quite well. ideally lasers should obtain the best score, then followed closely by hybrids, and then by projectiles, in order of their energy consumption. this is clearly not the case. as the author states, blaster damage output should be somewhat improved to compensate for their lack of range. their range should not be extended, otherwise we get op autocanons. 6 to bring the scores closer together, both tracking and damage of rails should be improved. i am hesitant to give exact figures, but adding 5% to each figure should do it. void and javelin suck, but thats the case with all guns, and reasons are well-known. there is also an obvious problem with gallente physisophy (britux with dualrepp, mwd and full rack of cap hungry guns, ), but i tried to concentrate o guns themselves here. please keep your criticism constructive. to csm: if you need numbers, references, or whatever else, tel me."
11/8/2010,"1 hybrid charges are mostl likly large due to there construction, ther ein essence micro bombs , they have a tastly core filled with some type of explosive and a hard outer shell, when used in a railgun the whole unit is fired at the target, when used in a blaster the core is suched out and super heated then fired like a water gun. which makes me think that they should most likly be doing more damage or like the rail guns in the moves , damage all 3 hp bars at the same time ( hey when was the last time you saw a movie that used rail guns the the thing didnt shoot a hole clean through its target)2 not sure if this would work, even due to size you still have some form of ammo belt to deal with and if that belt has 5 large projectile shots or 10 medium hybrid shots it gona take the same time to take down and replace.3 i personaly dont see why blasters have trackign issues to begin with, you woudl think that a weapon designed to work up to max 10k (ish) would be able to track anything in that zone. im perfactly up for giving blasters a insanly high hit anything in your range tracking ability, cause if a frig cant outrun a bs its doing something wrong4 never really used those ammos types so cant present argument"
11/8/2010,"heh true, never noticed maller was the bigger, so omen shouldn't be as good as it is then i guess.vexor compares to arbitrator, both in cost and function, arbitrator is easier to fit then vexor. omen compares to thorax, both take just as much cost and skill to fit properly, maybe the tiers are different but this is how it seems to be balanced. it's pretty awesome when fit right and using some decent cheap hardwires to boost it.bah i got the official tier wrong, but it's where it fits in the game regardless."
11/8/2010,"yes arby is fine, we know. this isn't a thread about the arby it is about the omen, ammars only dmg bonused lasor boat.doesn't even come close, the thorax can be fit below max skill with 800mm, 1-2 eanm. 1-2 magstabs and a dcu. the vexor fits any of the above mods just fine in it's lows,omen at max skill needs a powergrid rig or implant and has to fit 0 cpu resist mods.so noobs need max skill and implants to fly it while the harby fits fine, to bad you can't afford a harby or the implants while new.no maller fits fine with low skill and works even better with auto's...so yeah change the omens fitting to be more forgiving of low skill and more ease at high skill. good layout, weapons, bonuses and yet is the least used combat cruiser because of this."
11/8/2010,it does kinda suck
11/8/2010,"i'm sorry but i disagree. you want to be able to fit top tier weapons, a mwd, gank and a heavy tank? t.i.e. brother. you can't have it. all the other ships, albeit they aren't as tight, require some kind of fitting module/rig or intuitive fitting to make a good (t1) cruiser. have you noticed how small the sig of the omen is? its smaller than a stabber when fitted (shield modules/rigs)the vexor is a little different as it can rely heavily on drones but if you want to use that hybrid bonus you can only fit electrons and an 800mm plate with and a useful utility high (med neut. smalls are just too weak) if you use a fitting rig. yes the vexor has impressive dps but its using lolblasters and the omen can kite all that dps even within scram/web range and only has to worry about drone dps.the caracal is a real p.i.t.a. to fit. however i always like to fit it with aml's instead of hml's or ham's. this frees up loads of pg for those nice lse's and requires meta 4 modules or a 3% cpu implant to fit. its dps is fairly poor however those amls really hurt frigates. myself and a couple of other people in my corp have a navy caracal fitted with aml's to create a 60km frigate no fly zone around us. they even scare the balls off of dramiels.the stabber is paper thin. has low dps and fights deep into falloff. but wow! is it fast!.i really can't see anything wrong with t1 3rd tier cruiser balance in any way."
11/8/2010,"you realize that the omen has to use adaptive nano plating, 800mm plate and an afterburner to fit medium sized guns right? and it still gets less dps, slower and less ehp than the standard vexor with small guns."
11/8/2010,"the omen is faster, has a smaller sig and has considerably more range. a vexor has to rely on its drones to do the damage (unless you ac fit it). like i said, the vexor is a difficult ship to compare it to as intuitive fitting and thinking outside of the box works well with that ship. think of the poor caracal pilots who really struggle to get any meaning dps with a mwd and tank.an ab omen works well. a mwd + 800mm plate omen works well. a nano omen also works well. honestly. its already a good t1 cruiser. just stick your hands in your pocket and rig it."
11/8/2010,"and yet no one flys them.all your fits require high skill which is way to much to ask for newbe. go rig it? i am glad you are made of money but 7 months ago i could barely afford a cruiser hull. we are asking for the ability to fit a more conventional fit, not to make it overpowered. it's stats are not great fitting is just a little low for a standard armor ammar fit.it is great that you can fit it out well with rigs and implants, did you forget how it was when you had engineering 3-4 and electronics 3-4. the other cruisers not counting the caracal fit together at basic skill and all of are used(even the anti frig caracal). the omen is not on a regular basis. also you mentioned sheild fitting them? what new ammar pilot is training sheild skill?you can still use all your niche fits but this preposal is for new pilots with medium skill, and the ability to be able to get a more standard fit out of it. if you could the number of people flying it would rise and it would no longer be one of the dead ships.there is no downside what so ever to an omen fitting buff."

11/8/2010,"is that 3 rcu's...that is the most ******ed fit i have ever seen, you seem to be eft'ing with max skill caracters. which tells me you didn't even read the op or ignored it.the vexor can push that much dps with it's drones and fit over 20kehp. stabber kitting fits would eat both of those and the caracal needs a boost as well. but now it can fit an assault missile anti frig fit...try reseting those skill levels to below 2.5mil skill points and engineering and electronics 4 then make a fancy eft fit. use below meta 2 and make it cost under 10mil w/o rigs. you can do it fine with the others. then make a mwd, buffer, armor setup try not to use 400mm destroyer plates.three rcu's and less then 15ehp on a cruiser... thats a level of pathetic that is hard to top!"
11/8/2010,"this is an omen. it's a tier-2 cruiser. this is the kind of ship flown by people who can't get into a harbinger. you'd be lucky to get engineering 4, electronics 4, and weapon upgrades 3 out of these people.and this doesn't fit. it has three powergrid rigs and a meta-4 reactor control. no mwd, just an ab. only an 800mm plate, with a small meta-4 cap booster. the guns are focused meta-4 pulse lasers. there are no lasers that use less grid.nevermind the capacitor issues...[omen, the fitting mods -- they do nothing!]heavy modulated pulse energy beam iheavy modulated pulse energy beam iheavy modulated pulse energy beam iheavy modulated pulse energy beam iheavy modulated pulse energy beam iy-s8 hydrocarbon i afterburnersfleeting warp disruptor ismall electrochemical capacitor booster i, cap booster 200emergency damage control iextruded heat sink ifourier transform i tracking programbeta reactor control: reaction control i800mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates imedium ancillary current router imedium ancillary current router imedium ancillary current router iwarrior i x3"
11/8/2010,"no. those are top tier guns.the guns you were looking for are focused modulated pulse energy beams. those guns you got on there require 90 pg each (before skills) more than the lower guns.even with maxed skills you can't get the big guns on any cruiser without fitting mods. i've never been able to fit a thorax properly with anything bigger than ions. the vexor usually has to fit small guns instead of the mediums it has a bonus for and the vexor needs just as much skilling to get good stats out of it. honestly, these are t1 cruisers. t.i.e. understand that."

11/8/2010,"buying stuff in big quantities in the lp store is grueling, you click accept, the window refresh and you lose focus on the item you want to buy again. with the filter they implemented you can manage to display only the item you want to buy so you don't have to scroll each time anymore. that's the only thing that this overcomplicated filter achieves; getting rid of the scrolling. the dumb thing about it is that you still have to click 50 times on accept if you want 50 batch of ammo. why the hell can't you make the lp store like a real store ? you add a quantities column, you add 2 more columns: lp total and isk total for each row. big total at the bottom and checkout button. 1 simple click to buy everything you need ! numbers display as red if you can't proceed, displays as green if everything is fine, you need only 2 simple filters: affordable only and show all. you don't need more filters because we will scroll down the list only 1 time to add quantities...i want a lp store that works like a real simple ui store"

11/8/2010,"this proposal would increase the entry-level barrier for pvp, especially for new players. in my opinion the price of declaring war should vary with the corporation size and/or maybe character age.if two noobcorps want to fight, they should not have to give all their money to concord. it also clear that 2 mill is not enough o make someone think before declaring a war, so we need a sliding scale. anyway, that's not what is broken about high-sec wars. instead, two things need to be fixed for high-sec wars: station gamesneutral rryour proposal does not focus o the real issue."
11/8/2010,"so you do agree that the prices need to change? towards everything else said: there is alot of problems about neutral rr, but those are being addressed in different threads. station camping is always going to be there, i have seen both sides of the coin use it (i have seen plenty of omfgsohardcorepvpers and bleedingheartcarebear***s station camp like nobody's business) similar to the neutral rr fit. like i said before, if they neutral rr then have a cloaky+strike team on standby. its not hard to delegate these kinds of tasks if you are a decent fc. besides, best way to end a wardec is to cause as much isk harm as possible. fighting is cheap, war is expensive. towards the newb corps, once again 2 million is easy to obtain. its not necessarily a barrier if a corp knows what they are doing. a sliding scale would be beneficial, but even then if 7 man corp wardecs another 7 man corp, the price should definitely not be a pathetic 2 mil. maybe 25-50 mil for a corporation wardec, 100-200 for an alliance. nevertheless, the more complicated you make a damn module... the less likely ccp will implement. there are plenty of issues in this game that need to be sorted out. although this one is not as important as lag fixes, it is still an outdated issue that needs to be adjusted. thankfully, it is cheaper and easier to fix something as simple as prices depending on what kind of legacy code they are dealing with and what kind of module needs to be adjusted. i am not going to say wardecing prices are more/less important than station camping or neutral rr, but it is easier to adjust game prices than it is to implement new laws and algorithms for neutral rrers or causing pvp station huggers to bounce off if they have been aggressed."
11/8/2010,"jeez, just raise the prices high enough so that ward decs become serious matters again and not fly by night whims. its not brain surgery.atm, its just too easy to lock up some poor newb corp in their base for a month just because you think its funny to do so or have 3 ongoing decs at a time, all the time, just so you can free pvp in high sec without having to deal with pirates."

11/8/2010,"i'm wavering between saying that noobs should stick in the npc corps so they can't be war dec'd, and still have access to *somewhat* experienced players who can help them out every now and then, and player corps should have a large and stable enough pvp wing to be able to defend the new players on their own.there are, of course, times when the war dec should stop by force, as in when a group of people are just getting harassed constantly and not able to play the game because of this, but honestly, it's preventable..."

11/8/2010,@ durrrhhh ... please answer the following to show the masses your grasp of the current war dec game mechanic? 1) how many wars can a corp make?2) how many wars can an alliance make?3) how much is the cost of each war for a corp to make?4) how much is the
11/8/2010,well that's the whole point isn't it? high sec is supposed to be for new capsuleers to learn the game and casual gamers to tinker around. being stuck in an npc corp doesn't allow you to learn fleet cooperation or build a new corp for future movement into low sec and eventually null sec. discouraging new players to form/join corps hurts the entire community as a whole and the future of eve altogether.that's not to say they shouldn't face danger or the occasional war dec but too much arbitrary deccing goes on nowadays and a change in pricing to reflect how serious war decs should be would help to offset the issue.

11/8/2010,"ok this has irked me since i had enough sp to know what a hybrid turret was. there are a ton of rail gun type hybrids with many different names but there is one type that is mis named calling itself the ""xmm prototype i gauss gun"" when x is its size. i hope i don't have to get to technical but a gauss cannon and a rail gun are not the same weapon in both concept and design, in fact the only thing they do share is that they fire a ""bullet at high speed. now get this straight other than a name change this will not effect any stats on the weapons them selfs. i would like this implemented because as eve evolves there a good chance that new weapons will come out and i would like to see gauss cannons becoming a third hybrid turret type.as for the name to be changed to that could be a community vote, maybe a ""prototype lithium rail accelerator"" and yes if you want me to i will go over exactly how the 2 systems work and why there not the same."

11/8/2010,"i don't remember lds enabling flying through celestials, at least in i-war 2. your ship overheats by being in close proximity of a sun, not by going through it. fly close eneough, and you will blow up. anyway, lds doesn't function like eve's warp drive, it's is stated that it can't exceed the speed of light. i-war's counterpart to warp drive is capsule drive, which doesn't have option to change destination mid-flight."
11/8/2010,"*cough* warp disruption fields *cough*i do not support this directly. it does seem silly to see the ship fly through objects though. i suggest an option just to remove all object models while in warp.there really is no need for this, you are not ramming into something, there is a bubble around your ship (""warp bubble collapse in..."") and you aren't actually moving from what i've heard, the ship pulls matter around it or something. i don't know, sounded complicated when it was explained to me so i didn't really pay attention."
11/8/2010,there was a tim when we died warping through planets. . .abck in beta i think. it was almost as good as the amarr shuttle flying backwards. . .
11/8/2010,"well the term lds was ment to be linear displacement system, and was supposet to function up to the speed of light as neutonian physics says nothing can actually travel faster, so was the theory, although put into the game it made travel teadious as it took aaages to get to places. that sort of broke the games pace so they changed it to not have that upper speed limit. the capsule drive was another thing entirely, its i-war 2's equivalent of eves jump gate system... except the idea was that to activate the jump u had to be at a point of gravametric equilibrium, aka an area where gravity wells produced by planets cancelled each other out, they were refered to as lagrange points. anyways i digress!umm so ur arguing over semantics on something u didnt really listen to? and the idea of not moving and everything else moving around u to satisfy your own desires for travel is a tad egotystical. :si completely agree about the warp disruption fields btw and if spline curves can be created for routes around celestials so that the ships arrive at their destination on the same trajectory as if they came through whatever object then yah, that would be a perfect solution. warp disruption fields will then still catch people when set up normally. the only lag associated situ i can see is fleetwarp, alligning and fleetwarping to a location thats got a celestial obsticle would mean the fc or whoever initiates warp would have to upload the splines mathmatical formula (not much of a data throughput issue even on 56k's) to ccp servers to then distribute to all others associated. i guess a suitable delay entering warp would allow comms of that info so that every1 warps as one unit, and it would not need any ship to re-align to another point in space... just follow a curved warp trajectoryalso in terms of client side server side discrepencies.. a simple delay factor (dependent on celestial radius) server side when the warp line enters a celestial body would realign the time to destination on both client and server.. resulting in any warp disruption by another party close to destination to occur without differences between both parties.planting a large warp bubble perfectly on a curved warp trajectory round a planet would be practically impossible unless you travel on the same curves calculated client side (more than likely) on popular routes through systems. so that situation also stays unchanged.i should stop reading my gf's law books :s all in all.. not much addition server side apart from fleetwarp... some nice formulaic work client side and hey presto!"
11/8/2010,"the way i see it, the easiest ways of implementing this would be to either remove the planet models while warping, or make the ship do some kind of jump when passing through a celestial, like when jumping through a gate or like a probe warps. (alltho a bit less shiny i guess, to not wear it out)"
11/8/2010,nice idea
11/8/2010,my $15 bucks a month vote... says yes!
11/8/2010,"there has been a long need for bonuses depending on your race. now so.there is not some over the top ship to be preferred in large fleet fights, they will be limited.introducing racial tiers:**amarr**tier 1 = 5% bonus to laser capacitor usagetier 2 = 5% bonus to armor resistancestier 3 = 5% bonus to laser damage**gallente**tier 1 = 5% bonus to hybrid turret trackingtier 2 = 5% to drone damagetier 3 = 5% to hybrid turret damage**caldari**tier = 5% missles explosion velosity on misslestier = 5% rate of fire on missles launcherstier = 5% damage to all missles**minmitar**tier = 5% fall off on projectile turretstier = 5% to optimal rangetier = 5% to damageto unlock these tiers one would need to add a micro-plex to their account. micro-plex can be bought the same way as normal plex but cost on third as much.the first micro-plex added to your account would be tier 1. now here is where it gets good. the micr-plex last for 30 days. if you add a second one while the first one is still active, then younger tier 2. add another and you get tier 3.these racial tiers are dependant on your actual race but some people might not like that. i think it adds flavor to the game."
11/8/2010,don't forget to give a thumbs up if you like the idea. please do not discuss moderation. steviesg
11/8/2010,"firstly - terribad troll, terribad implimentation, terribad idea.secondly - what the hell are th bonus'? minmatar should be damage, rof and optimal range (for fleet), the and amarr should be damage, resists and optimal range. . .srsly, you want to make minmatar the longest ranged, fastest ships right?oh i see what you did there."

11/8/2010,nope not supporting it in this form at all.racial bonus' could only work if you would strip 1 ship bonus from all those and replace it with a racial bonus un racial ships.needing implants/plex/something is not racial based thats implant based....
11/8/2010,no.
11/8/2010,no.

11/8/2010,no.no because of the micro-plex idea.no because there is no need for racial bonuses. no because it won't add flavour to the game.and no because of the god-awful red text that makes my head and eyes hurt every time i try to read it (you are aware i had to copy your entire post into notepad in order to be able to read it aren't you?).

11/8/2010,"this isn't a ""graphics issue"" whatever that is supposed to mean in the context of the op. gas giant planets are, quite simply, larger than other planets, and as such the links between objects are longer. because they are longer they consume more power - it's not an issue, it's the way gas giants work."
11/8/2010,"a tcu would still be used to claim space, so there would be no accidental taking of sov.the security index would start at a medium level to give some security against flip flops but not provide the full defensibility right away. pve activity such as mining and ratting would contribute to the security index. killing enemy invaders would contribute to the security index. on the other hand, losing ships, losing pos structures, having station services and pos's reffed would deteriorate the security index. if you are attacking an afk empire you will quickly deteriorate their index even if they don't show up to fight by doing things like reffing pos's and station services. suppressing thier pve will mean they wont be able to re-cooperate those index losses, and in a short while the index will be in the attackers favor (low)once the index is low the attackers might be able to more quickly sbu, have less ehp to get through on the station/hub/tcu, and timers might be moved more towards the attackers preference. this would force alliances to use the space they claim, and to actively defend it. it would give small gangs a meaningful effect on the sov war by spreading out and hitting infrastructure and limiting pve."
11/8/2010,"well, if you go and read my full post"
11/8/2010,"the problem, of course, is that since the term ""blob"" is a meaningless word, it will always be the case that some people use it as a complaint. split up sov objectives and the attacker/defender can bring more ships to each relevant system? they're blobbing! split it up into 20 objectives and the defender/attacker can still bring more? yep, blobbing. get rid of sov entirely and there are some objectives that someone wants to take/defend (capital ships arrays, a bubbled titan, whatever) and there will still be bigger fleets and smaller fleets, better equipped fleet and more poorly equipped fleets, and so on. and thus, complaints about ""blobs"". refining how sov warfare works is a good goal, but trying to ""fix"" ""blobs"" is a never ending, quixotic errand. and one that simply ends up punishing those who are able to work together more effectively and punishing them again and again and again. because, really, even if your sov proposal was put into practice and each of the involved systems still had a defender ratio of 3:1 with the attackers, do you think that people would be fine with ""blob"" warfare then? or would we see another round of requests to accomplish, through the forums, what certain people are unable to accomplish in game? and requests to accomplish it by any means necessary? stop blues from using each other's titans, black ops, bridges. stop blues from even being able to identify each other without opening up the ticker column on the overview. what's next, if you're in a fleet that's greater than 2:1 with you opponent's fleet, your subscription fee goes up by 50% per month? there will never be a valid mechanics fix to a ""problem"" that isn't a problem at all, and is due to mechanics functioning exactly as intended. each and every single proposal, even if followed to the letter, will simply generate calls for even stricter, even more extreme, more draconian and more importantly, more nonsensical punishments to anybody who beats someone in game when their opponents can't adapt and are unwilling to find a new niche. short of wow style arena combat, the ""anti-blob"" faction simply will not get what they want. not ever. and when eve switches over to instanced combat arenas, it's pretty much dead."
11/8/2010,"i never suggested that it was the solution to blobs.only that it would offer some viable options to counter the blob, or at least split it up and annoy it a bit. numbers will still matter. eve will never be a game like wow where the opposing forces are carefully balanced against each other."
11/8/2010,then what's the point?
11/8/2010,"i know (and for what it's worth i like your suggestion a hell of a lot more than dominion). but that's what people are demanding, and that's what all these suggestions are about. it's all ""blob"". again though, you're thinking about it from a problem solving point of view. the whole complaint about blobs is a solution in search of an actual problem, however. even if you split up the ""main blob"" into 20 groups, there will be the same complaint if the attackers can't outnumber the defenders ""they're blobbing every one of the 20 systems!"" altering sov so that it makes more sense and doesn't involve shooting sov structures with more ehp than some supercaps is awesome. but it is impossible to ameliorate let alone solve ""blobs"", because the term is meaningless. a fleet battle which is 1:2 will almost always have cries of ""blobbing!"" i agree, but also that's the point. some people will and can never be happy if that's not the case. as long as attackers/defenders can drastically (or, as we've seen sometimes, even slightly) outnumber the other force, and/or if they can field better shipes, someone will be complaining about a ""blob"" and looking for ways to change game mechanics to hurt those who can beat them in game using game mechanics functioning exactly as intended. eve is a great game, and it'll work on the axis that makes eve great. and wow, if you like that sort of game, is great on that axis too. people who need ""fairness"" out of combat and don't want groups to be able to cooperate past the ""guild"" level already have a game that caters to exactly what they want. hell, for all i know you could also build a mod to make your elf look like a spaceship."
11/8/2010,"i like the idea of at the very least changing the jb pass from the tower pass, but would like the idea of not having to have a pass if i'm in the alliance, or even if i'm in an alliance on some kind of allow list like in chat channels. reds apparently can't jump anyway even if they have the pass, and having to put the pass in for every jump is annoying, it doesn't do anything, just requires more repeition.also, i don't get the way some people seem to think that making some things easier in eve is turning eve into easy mode. ""i want fewer clicks in pi"" ""no your making eve into easy mode""""i want to be able to rename ships i'm not currently end""""easy mode!""""i want to be able to organize my stuff""""easy mode!""its like trying to talk with conservatives about real issues. they just automatically call it communism, socialism, ****sm, facisim, anti-american, helping the terrorist, etc. then they use them all interchangeably."
11/8/2010,see?
11/8/2010,"this is very interesting but it wouldnt stop things like still assembling a giant fleet from a coalition to siege stuff etc, or worse using an alt corp to drop towers so that you can just reinforce them yourself to mess with the index.if the intention is essentially to limit the ability to hold lots of space, why not just stop taking half measures and put an exponential cost on it? if you make it so that its unrealistic that an alliance can hold more than say half a region... a region at most... then we would start to see alliances start to trim the fat, more alliances get out into 0.0 more boarder skirmishes etc etc..."
11/8/2010,"reffing towers that are neutral to the sov holder wouldn't detract the index. (this would discourage in a way having a bunch of allied towers in your system who don't defend their stuff, adding a small layer of difficulty on managing coalitions)ccp originally did plan to have exponential cost increases, after further review they decided against it. i think that we have a lot in common mini, we agree that sov warfare in its current state can get a little boring likely because it places too much focus on getting large maximum dps fleets together to siege the key structures. your focus seems to be on reducing the size of those fleets, mine on providing a role for small a mobile fleets in sov warfare. perhaps we need a little bit on both ends."
11/8/2010,"i wasnt suggesting that such a tactic would be used to take sov, i am far more concerned it will be used to keep sov.eg. i own a system, someone else starts to pvp/npc whatever in my system. im worried my index will drop too low, so i dump a bunch of poses into the system with either alts or whatever, then i reinforce the poses i have put down, instantly jumping my own claim to the system without really having to do much."
11/8/2010,"ah, i believe that a tower metric should only affect the towers that are owned by or blue by the system owner. shooting neutral towers in the system would have no gain or reduction in the system. think of it kind of like how pre-dominion sov was. you had to bash all the towers down. in this model you wouldn't be required to bash them all down, but it would be one option among many. though the same argument can be said about hiring a merc corp to come and die to you a lot. but that will cost a substantial amount of money as the index gain for killing invading ships would be based on insurance values. we're getting into the technicalities of how the indexes function, which should ccp implement a system like this i'm sure they wouldn't get into publishing the inner workings. but with some thought it certainly possible to limit the ability to exploit the system."
11/8/2010,currently the prophecy has very little to differentiate it from the harbinger. the -10% per level cap usage bonus of medium energy turrets is very underwhelming and so many people are much happier to fit ac's or blasters.i propose that the prophecy's turret bonus be changed to +10% optimal range of energy turrets per level. this will then give the prophecy a far more defined and different role other than a brick with epic ehp or the poor man's harbinger.
11/8/2010,"well acs work wonders what you need lazors for? :pyeah it is true, its like a brutix fit tank and acs and you'll do better than tank and blasters.dont know why you'll need more optimal on pulses :\ (oh shut up they have the best optimal+falloff combination)"
11/8/2010,just trying to give the prophecy a really useful bonus that isn't a damage bonus. an optimal bonus would make little difference to pulse's but a great difference to beams. a sniper prophecy would become very appealing.
11/8/2010,it will suck just like current railox.
11/8/2010,"over 200 dps @ 90km (optimal) with 50k ehp, mwd and 100km targeting from a t1 1st tier bc is good enough."
11/8/2010,yes pulse sniping is definatly underpowered.i always prefered the idea of an rof bonus for the punisher maller and proph so if you fit auto's you get lol dps and if you fit lasers you get a quicker cap out but they are better dmg.but anything to make the laser chicken a better laser boat then auto's will do. go go scorch sniper laser chicken!
11/8/2010,"i sort of like this, it would make a nice little trinity between the harbinger (tank and dps but not range), zealot (dps and range, but not tank) and the prophecy (tank and range, but not dps).however, i'd prefer the prophecy to be khanidised. black ham prophecy ftw."
11/8/2010,"i searched and i honestly couldn't find a thread like this, so here's my proposition.i know that suicide ganking is still somewhat of a problem in eve, and if i remember correctly, ccp has said that suicide ganking is an unintended result of the mechanics of the game, and it is still somewhat of a problem in high sec. my very simple proposition is this: fine players a dynamic cost for each ship that they destroy in 0.5 systems and higher that are not at war, or do not have any kill rights whatsoever (no red flashy), or in other words, any incident that requires concord to step in. the fine would be given to each player separately, at the same amount, and would change depending on the size of the ship and the estimated market value of the materials on board. i.e. let's say there's a regular industrial carrying 1 bil worth of material, based on regional market prices for the material. for the industrial, the fine would be 500k isk. for the material, the fine would be equal to the average buy order price per unit of that material. also, in order to filter out the scams with prices that are extremely low or high on the market, the fine could be calculated excluding orders that are a certain number of standard deviations away from the median.please note that i am not a carebear, i just think that attacks on convoys and freighters belong in war decs when it's in high sec, and not with suicide ganks.thanks for your time"
11/8/2010,"ccp has also stated that highsec is safer, not safe.it is a good thing that most suicide ganks are to grab juicy deadspace/officer modules that are valued about 10k isk according to the material value. i mean who in their right mind would gank a freighter full of tritanium?also how would this fine work for people with empty wallets?"
11/8/2010,"and how do you suggest we handle the npc corp alts that do the bulk of the hauling?since you can't war dec an npc corp.or is this really a stealth ""let us dec npc corps!!"" whine?no. sorry - just no. suicide ganking is fine, and charging people to do it will only raise the thresh hold of what they gank. it won't stop them from ganking. especially those are doing it for the lulz anyway."
11/8/2010,"i understand high sec is safer, but not completely safe. however, this wouldn't make high sec completely safe, as corps could still start a war dec with another corp in order to destroy their industrials and such. also, what i meant was the value of the material or item itself as a whole, not the materials it was made up of. that was a mistake on my part. i.e. for faction modules, the fine would be according to the value of the faction item itself, not the materials it's made up of.also, for players with no isk, this is an interesting problem. there are a couple solutions, and the one that comes to my mind is that the player would then have to work off the debt to concord by doing missions and such in order to make the isk back to concord. i.e. they would get none of the isk, but it would go directly to their debt. this would make it so that if a player has a main where he/she would keep all of his or her isk, this person would still have to pay the fine, either by transferring from their main to pay the fine, or doing the work on their alt."
11/8/2010,"quit assuming every post i make is a troll post. this is not a stealth whine, it's just an idea that i had.definition of griefing according to ccpaccording to that, if people are ""just doing it for the lulz"", then they are griefing. with my idea in place, suicide ganking would no longer become profitable, and hence could be defined as griefing and would be against ccp policies.also, according to my post, the fine would be relative to what was in the cargo of the destroyed ship and the ship itself, so no, it will not raise the threshold of what they gank.as for npc corp alts, i'm open to suggestions."
11/8/2010,"i don't assume that every post you make is a troll post. in fact i've even agreed with a couple of your posts (one of them this morning in fact).my issue with your idea is you're trying to fix a non-existent problem. there's nothing wrong with suicide ganking. it's not even that hard to protect yourself from it.as for the profitability, you're right - i misread your original post. of course, you could accomplish the same thing by saying suicide ganking is against the rules and that spawning concord = instant ban. no programming required.of course we'll lose a lot of new players that accidentally shoot their fleet mates, but omelet = broken eggs right?"
11/8/2010,"it's not a problem? how so? i thought it was still a fairly large problem in eve.particularly, a few days ago i was transporting some superconductors to jita in order to sell (for about twice or 3 times the amount they would go for in my home system, yay iskies!), and on the way, i was targeted at least 4 times. that indicated to me that suicide ganking is still somewhat of a problem in the eve universe (no one ganked me because it wasn't worth it).as for the suicide ganking against rules, instaban, that might be true, however i think we would find it more effective to take away the profit of it in order to discourage it in other ways rather than just punishment by ccp officials. in other words, motivate people not to do it, as it would make an automated system, instead of people possibly trying to do it and not get caught.as for new players, i would honestly think that they would get popped long before they accidentally destroy a fleet mate's ship. if they're in a corporation together, then i wouldn't impose the fee, because that is simply the corporation's mistake for letting that person in."
11/8/2010,"suicide ganking as it is now is a definite problem to those being ganked. i wouldn't expect those who live by ganking to be in here supporting this. after all, its pretty much an exploit as its based on figuring out how to circumvent the concord game mechanic. either way, i'm all for a middle ground here. the problem is easily solved by making the wreck of ganked ship accessible only to the the person ganked, thereby negating the potential payout that makes suicide ganking worth the initial cost or by having either no loot dropped on high sec ganks or by having concord destroy the wreck.none of these options makes suicide ganking impossible or illegal thereby making high sec safer, it just eliminates suicide ganking for profit. iow, you can still gank people for revenge or kill mail, but not for profit. this is really the way it should be as it means you would actually have to lose something in order to kill illegally in high sec but the option would still be there.problem solved."
11/8/2010,or people could just stop flying around as pi<U+FFFD>ata. there are plenty of ways to avoid suicide ganking.1. don't carry more than 1bn in a freighter2. use the corporate hangar/ship maintenance bay of the orca3. use cloaky transports. (not afk hauling ready)if you really have to violate rule number 1:a) have a scoutb) have someone webbing the freighter (double web daredevil or rapiers are awesome for the job)and suddenly ganking you becomes much less likely.
11/8/2010,"eve is an mmo, it shouldn't be designed for people to fly 10b of stuff in a freighter solo. ever. there are so many different ways to prevent getting ganked in high sec. laziness and stupidity is why people get ganked in high sec, not game mechanics."
11/8/2010,"if you know of someone who has performed a suicide gank and not gotten the ship they were in popped by concord, you are correct, that is exploit. by all means file a petition, and that individual will receive the swift banhammer of justice.on the other hand, if concord showed up, and said individual(s) lost the ships they were in at the time of the gank, then no exploit was committed. they committed a crime and they paid the price."
11/8/2010,"the ""exploit"" i'm talking about is figuring out how much firepower is needed to take a certain ship down before you yourself get popped by concord. not a strict exploit of course, but that's why in my op i said ""pretty much an exploit"".reading through the thread you can plainly see it consists of 2 groups of people, those who get ganked and those who do the ganking. guess which ones support this and which don't.like i said, i'm not saying it should be illegal to suicide gank, just that they're shouldn't be any payout for it.how fair would you think it was if i put up an insurance policy on my wife, murdered her and even though i went to jail, i still got the insurance payout and everything she owned. current suicide ganking is too much like laughing all the way to jail while flashing your victim's wallet."
11/8/2010,err lol yes... well ... no :)
11/8/2010,"like i said, if you're the one doing the ganking, then of course you think its good and fair.you're right darius, don't fly a money balloon around and it won't happen to you. i only find it aggravating because i'd love to be able to put together a mission ship with officer modules loaded, but that's become as dangerous as giving northern coalition the raspberries in null sec. some things you just don't do out of common sense, but it doesn't mean you have to like that you can't do them or not try to change them.will this issue be resolved in the future? no, of course not but i'll still give it a thumb."
11/8/2010,"i don't gank, and i don't support this proposal either. your initial premise is flawed."
11/8/2010,"no, they actually said it's an intended mechanic that is fully supported.it's only a ""problem"" for people that persist in afk-autopiloting valuables in untanked haulers."
11/8/2010,"no, its a problem for any pilot flying a ship that's worth enough.well vel, if you don't gain or lose from this proposal then why are you even interested enough to be in the thread? not that you aren't entitled to your opinion, i was just curious. you're certainly allowed to be in here, i was just wondering why it mattered enough for you to take the time to respond if it doesn't effect you."
11/8/2010,"that sounds like ""if you dont agree, get out of the thread"". sorry thats not how it works.p.s.: i havent been ganking myself either."
11/8/2010,is there a link to something from ccp saying this?
11/8/2010,"this comming from someone that has never suicideganked but has been suicideganked.its fine. i made a mistake, i lost my ship.if you feel you're scanned down by suicidegankers, quickly get the **** out and dont warp to next gate.if you feel you're afraid to lose your officerfit, dont fly it. and under no circumstance go to that one mission hub for that one corp in that certain part of caldari space. we all know what im talking about. bottom line is that you should neverever fly something you cant affoard to lose, including whats in cargo. lesson everyone should be familiar if they have found their way to forums."
11/8/2010,"because i like eve and changes like this will fundamentally affect the dark and dangerous feeling that makes the game fun for me. so it's not entirely accurate to say i don't stand to lose. i stand to lose an aspect of the game that makes it interesting - the idea that even in ""safe"" parts of space, i still need to pay attention, and not be complacent. that even in safe parts of space, i, my ship, and my cargo are at risk. taking that away would diminish eve."
11/8/2010,"not supported.at least not until highsec ceases being a major isk faucet through missions etc. if highsec was just for brand new newbies, industry and trading i would support this, but it's far more than this atm."
11/8/2010,"fair enough, that's one of the more logical reasons i've heard on this or any other subject of late. admittedly my own reasons are selfish since i would just like the ability to fly around a bs with officer modules without having a target painted on my back, but like i said, supported or not, this idea will never be implemented so it sort of makes the discussion rather hypothetical at best.cheers and safe flying."
11/8/2010,"you know you want them. we all want them.skills don't matter, make them insane. electronics v mechanics v gunnery v, hell make it all of them.but please make salvage runs less pain."
11/8/2010,"bump.also consider the social aspect of a system like this. currently the sort of cooperation you have while mining is hauling, mining, boosting.with this suggestion you can have someone first drill away useless rock with a strip miner, second person comes in with a smaller ship and removes the last parts that was missed by the blunt strip miner. a third person mines most of the exposed minerals with another strip miner and a fourth person mines the scraps that's left with a smaller laser.that's four people involved just in the mining process (two of which can be new players), then you also have the hauling and boosting like before. it got potential for being more social and newb friendly, while not stopping anyone from doing it solo."
11/8/2010,"this sounds an awful lot like my idea that i posted yesterday. however, this one has a lot more built upon it and is... meh... presented better than mine. i support it.what about having artifacts inside the asteroid that is scannable, and you would have to carefully clean it off and pull it out of the asteroid without damaging it, like i mentioned in my post?"
11/8/2010,"would love a link to that post btw.. cause as i see it.. macro miners/ratters are the only viable producers of isk to online eve isk sellers.we all know isk sellers are against ccp's eula as they allow players to negate ccp's methods put in place to allow players isk for cash. that cash goes to ccp... but instead its going to 3rd parties.. allowing payment of programmers to build better more sophisticated macro programmes to carry on the cycle.in my oppinion macro's are inadvertently linked to isk sellers. isk sellers are pulling money away from ccp. all the in game accounts associated with this process, whether buying, selling or producing isk in game, are funded via plex's because its relatively free for them and has no paper trail back to persons or locations.there are 3 groups that u can act against:#1 the in-game macro isk makers#2 the online isk sellers#3 the desperate eve-online playercombating #3 has some effects, but requires lots of time and resources to do. much like killing a tree by cutting each individual leaf off, and monitoring it constantly to cut any new leaves that appear.combating #2 has been tried but as online retailers, selling game currency isnt illegal under any law in any country. this practise can only be discouraged.combating #1 i dont think has been tried as it requires creating new features and trying to make it macro-proof. which i understand is extremely difficult. the raw data is there to investigate suspected macro'ers but again time and resources. plus shutting down individual players becomes ineffective as others spring up almost immediately to counter the loss.the only way i can see ccp creating systems that are macro proof is to include randomisers, much like in casinos and gambling websites, so that it randomises parts of the selection process in mining. that way if and when the random number generating formula is hacked and a workaround is developed for use in a macro, ccp can update to a new formula and block out the macro's attempts.the only other way, which would be entertaining to a degree, would be to include a system whereby damage is done to modules and ships that are not constantly monitored... im not a miner myself but remember reading about skillbooks that allow miners to stop or prevent gas explosions in certain ore types. if asteroids contained several types of ore that are only uncovered upon closer inspection with scanners, then situations can be put in place whereby a severe explosive event can occur without proper monitoring and preventative measures. btw soz for the wall of text!"
11/8/2010,"i honestly don't think that pi is a very good example in your argument of ccp not doing minigames well. pi is essentially an unfinished product, since it's going to be coupled with dust 514, and hence still has a very large part of it missing. honestly, i like pi also, i don't see how it's a bad minigame.honestly, i can't really think of any true mini-games in eve, and on top of that, even if there were a minigame that wasn't all that good made by ccp, that is by no means a reason to immediately discredit all possible minigames that they could come out with in the future."
11/8/2010,"i like this idea, would make minign fun and more profitable. though ccp might have to reduce the ore recovered from modules to force pirates to only kill a few mining ships per night"
11/8/2010,i like the idea of making mining more interactive but i do not like the idea proposed here.... where is the half support button ...
11/8/2010,necronotice that the op's last bump was back in july. double dee brought it back up to say not supported just before it would otherwise have been locked due to age.
11/8/2010,"nm, just read the last post."
11/8/2010,"so you want to virtualize a virtual game?and you want to split up your proposals into 2 threads. how could i e.g. support your idea to make mining more interactive (which ccp wants do with ring and comet mining), if i dont like your arena idea? correct, i cant."
11/8/2010,"ccp already looked into providing a simulator and it was rejected. as has been stated if you want risk free pvp the test server is available most of the time.i'm more interested in an arena system where you use ""real"" ships and have to pass though acceleration gates to enter. this would only allow ships (and pilots) conforming to the specific match requirements to enter."
11/8/2010,"an arena system would be cool, but i don't think that it is unsurmountable for a player organization to run this sort of event themselves.it's won't be free though, ship loss is what drives the economy :)"
11/8/2010,"yes we can set something up as players.we can also delete the market and establish a barter system where people ""give isk"" and jettison trade items out of their cargo hold in space near each other.sometimes it's nice to have a refined system for doing things instead of a clunky player-made workaround for a lack of mechanics.think for a second, people might actually be able to get some ""good fights"" instead of the ""never fight unless you can win"" mentality. it certainly helps keep a nation going, but it isn't necessarily the most fun."
11/8/2010,"well that's depressing. i wasn't necessarily just looking for risk free pvp, but rather just something that we could use to escape the dreaded station-spinning phase we all go through every now and then. the no risk, no reward thing was just to make it so that folks aren't immediately repulsed by it because of loss, and also aren't drawn into it as a permanent thing since there's no reward.to be honest, if any good, and somewhat in-depth, minigame could be provided in-station, i would be happy. again, all i want is something to escape the station spinning that we all go through every now and then..."
11/8/2010,"/signed - and we can watch from the comfort of an ambulation bar, in which scantly clad minmatar slave girls (r loose federation girls) dance on tables.one nice addition to the gates idea, would also allow it to be set to certain players only, so as to avoid the system being so badly abused that no one uses it."
11/8/2010,"slave girls? ok, i'm on board.we need a spectator sport to watch in the station bars...."
11/8/2010,i do like the idea of making mining more interactive. it would give mining fleets more to do while making it harder for macro miners to operate.
11/8/2010,"this should affect one in five constellations and is similar to how wh global bonus / debuff effects work.every now and then due to certain cosmic changes constellations will have a global buff / debuff depending on how you look it, it can affect any constellation and can last upto 48 hours and change every 3 hourseffect 1 - constellation is naturally cyno jammedeffect 2 - 50% reduction on em resistseffect 3 - 50% reduction on thermal resistseffect 4 - 50% reduction on kinetic resistseffect 5 - 50% reduction on explosive resistseffect 6 - 100% increase to shield hpeffect 7 - 100% increase to armor hpeffect 8 - cloaking modules cannot be activatedeffect 9 - larger targets (such as super caps / structures / starbases) will receive 5x more damageeffect 10 - aoe will deal 5x more damage (such as bombs / smartbombs)effect 11 - mining modules take damage while mining (like overheating)effect 12 - all ships will appear on overview careless of range so you can wtz on themtheres more but you get the idea.atm battles are all about numbers (in 0.0 at least anyway) with systems changing effects people will have to be more strategic with what they bring, ship types will be considered.also macros will have to be careful, as certain effects will not benefit people afk so to speak ;)idea may need tweaking ;)"
11/8/2010,i like the idea tbh... tho i think in terms of tweaking.. it shouldnt be a blanketed constellation bt a source point and any systems within a certain lightyear range possibly... otherwise alliance scouts and roams will pick up on effects and capitalise on them based only on targets in a constellation. a sourcepoint in one system and affecting only systems in a certain range will throw a complexity element into it rather than an easily identifiable area.it would also be advantageous to scout other systems to tie down a point of origin.kinda like 1 of my ideas bt with a bigger paint brush =) see my csm prop 2 link in my sig!
11/8/2010,i believe the sansha incursions will bring in some effects (cyno-jamming is one example)
11/8/2010,will this affect 0.0? also link please :)
11/8/2010,"i don't know about 0.0. and i honestly can't remember the location. it was a couple weeks back, i might hav heard it on sisi during the tests there. my apologies :son the other hand, i support some sort of natural phenomena. it would bring some variation in!"
11/8/2010,"this is correct. if you enter a system on sisi with an active incursion there will be a variety of effects - some that i have seen include market price fluctuations (war tax), and tank modifiers (i don't remember the specific values)."
11/8/2010,"why is ccp so bad at advertising future stuff to come, this sounds great but after checking blogs and well alot of other stuff i cant find any info on this.for an expansion that is rumoured to be out on the 16th there hasnt been much talk about it :(so i was thinking of sins of a solar empire when i came up with this idea and how magnetic clouds etc affected drones etc and noticed (even though there isnt alot of info on it) it is something getting implemented in incursion, does anyone know if it will affect 0.0 though??"
11/8/2010,gives spacebook a real use
11/8/2010,spacebook has no utility for me right now. this would be a positive step.
11/8/2010,"i like the idea of manually setting the skill queue from eve gate, but if full api access is exposed i fear that it defeats the purpose of the queue. regardless of the built in queue length, full api access to this would allow any 3rd-party tool to automatically manage an indefinitely long queue.it would be nice to be able to change training without the full eve client, but i think whatever mechanism that allows this should keep within the limits of the current system."
11/8/2010,supported for making sov warfare suck less. and not letting this disappear into the ether.
11/8/2010,they took somthing bad and made is worse.
11/8/2010,it really should be more compelling than it is currently.
11/8/2010,"sov and all things 0.0 need to be looked at and a team need to be focused on 0.0 at all timesoh and for the record, the team should look at the following areasnapssov claiming (timers etc)blob warfaresupercap spamming"
11/8/2010,"agree, sov needs some further attention.shameless plug for my own idea's here."
11/8/2010,"agreed, sov needs work. hope ccp take a look at sxygeek's idea."
11/8/2010,"hey ccp what is wrong with you !! i hear you are replacing live events with this incursion ncp rubbish, well done you just killed of the most fun part in eve, the interaction with devs. live events was not broken so why you changing it !! maybe some of us pilots want live events and liked how they worked. if i wanted to run dungeons there are plenty of complexes and scan sites around why oh why does live events get the axe ? speak up ccp explain yourselves !! so i put it to you the players and roleplayers, boycott incursion and let us keep live events, if we want just ncp's we can run missions/complexes/scan sites/wormholes.eve was the first game i played where i could see devs and likes in the flesh so to speak ingame. evetv = deadlive events = deadroleplaying = soon dead if incursion hits"
11/8/2010,"huh?you realize that the sansha incursions aren't the only live events the dev's are going to throw, just the first, right?also, roleplaying was very much alive for the 3 years where there were no live events, and i dare say it will be very much alive after them if ccp decides to stop...which they aren't."
11/8/2010,"supporting my own idea. as for routing several storages to the same process, i do this sometimes because i run out of storage in one launchpad and have to use some other storage/launchpad instead, in which case the new materials arriving to the old one are also routed to the next processor.. well, the really good solution to all this would be: *drumroll* upgradeable launchpads/storages."
11/8/2010,that would be nice too.
11/8/2010,"breaking up the blob fleets would be best achieved by first breaking up the players by discouraging large alliances and naps.for this to happen ccp need to ramp of the competition in eve over limited resources. limited resources being key. whatever, players are fighting over needs to be of a nature that only so many can benefit from it. that way expanding a corp/alliance roster or naping up the galaxy becomes counter productive to player goals.the other means would be to utilize the game lore, like nearly every mmorpg eve's lore is of races/nations/factions that are at war with one another. if players benefited for picking sides and having their faction prevail over others, directly drawing them into these conflicts we would have further useful divisions among the player base (and no existing fw does not do this).the first idea suits nullsec best and the second empire and npc nullsec,neither would take away from eve being a sandbox like many other ideas on this subject.eve needs a massive injection of cut throat competitive pvp over limited resources and an equally significant change in making the game's lore relevant to players. all of which in turn would mean a nuclear nerf of what amounts to themeparkish pve grinding in eve, which at present dominates gameplay.then when it comes to fleets, mechanics that encourage strategy and mobility. remove local chat, boost bo, nerf gate camping, more ae weapons, constellation or region wide simultaneous objectives for sov warfare. there's loads of ideas already out there. yeah i'm sure you could and would be prepared to waste your time doing so as well. although i do find it amusing that you would mention the battle of iswandlwana, when the battle of rorke's drift immediately following it is one of the most well known battles (in part thanks to the movie) where the very few stood against the very many and won.yeah numbers count a lot, but so does training/skill, morale, strategy/tactics etc etc. look on map at the size of italy or england, those relatively tiny places in the past ruled a good portion of the world. however, being a game it's fun and playability that ought to count more than anything else. of course that's far more subjective than even what contributes to winning rl battles and wars."
11/8/2010,"the problem is simply who you will favour:- if you split the targets so that the attacker need to destroy something in 2+ systems at the same time to conquer 1 system you favour the defender that will only need to defend one of the systems and will blob that one.- if you split the targets so that the defender has to defend 2 different systems while the attacker need to kill something in only one you favour the attacker that will blob 1 single target while the defender is divided.so essentially you will gift someone with local superiority at the expense of the other player. beside the strange dream where in rl having more people don't count , outside d&d and martial arts films in a battle numbers count. you can cover a 2:1 gap with better tactics, training and equipment. maybe a 3:1 but very rarely more than that (prepared fortifications and terrain change those numbers, but we are speaking of ""open space"" battles where the terrain and fortifications are the pos guns, cinoyammers and the gate). people want ""small gangs"" to be capable of making a ""difference"". the problem is that if the small gangs can make a difference the big alliance will send out three, four or more small gangs for every small gang sent out by the smaller alliance, so the smaller alliance will still be losing much more of what it will gain. the only difference would be that both parties would be losing terrain or structures at a higher pace than before. honestly i don't see how you can change the game in a way that will ""balance"" the number advantage without making the game unplayable.the people that gather the higher number of active players must have an advantage. if you look there is an exception in eve: wormholes. if you operate there the group with the higher numbers in ""normal"" space generally will not be capable of using its superiority in wh space thanks to the limited access to wh space, but that is not a solution that can be used in regular 0.0 warfare.and the wh solution is to offer ""local superiority"" to someone reducing the maximum number of ""troops"" that you can gather in the battle site. so it not really resolve the 2+ to 1 advantage, it simply force people to play with lower numbers of participants. sxygeek idea of a security number that can be ""eroded"" even by attacks from small groups linked above is the most viable i have seen to give meaning little gangs activity. maybe it could work."
11/8/2010,"hmm. damn, you're right. why defend multiple points if the objective can't be lost as long as you hold one?maybe, to use incursions as an example, when under attack, the sansha actually effect things in system. i forget what, but it's significant. makes day to day activites frustrating and slower at best, impossible at worse. thus giving players a reason beyond roleplaying to go kill the sansha.so, employ a similiar system for sov. alliance a is attacking alliance b, trying to take system 1. to do so, they've got to take objectives in the surrounding systems. the defenders, if they ignore those other systems, risk long term impact on day to day activites therein. though really, the security index thing you linked is probably a better way to go, and seems quite interesting."
11/8/2010,"having joined gallente faction warfare a week ago i have noticed that the hub system for gallente (villore) is bias to caldari in comparison to the hub system of caldari for the gallente proportion.this is due to the security rating and thus the strength of the navy npcs (0.5 gallente and 0.8 caldari). i have found that a few caldari corps base out of villore where they are attacked by the weak npcs which are easily tanked. however, i could not do this to them because the npcs would kill me due to the superior strength.moving isn't really an option due to the lack of fed def stations in higher sec systems close to the low sec battlegrounds.i believe that this must be one of the reasons for the high turnover of people in faction warfare. because we get camped in our home system people can't be bothered with faction warfare anymore so they leave. then this goes on to having a lack of pvpers in the opposition so those on the other side leave because a lack of pvp. if you followed this through all the way you could probably see some market volume reductions in it, in terms of ships and fittings etc.what i want brought up is the unfairness of the npc's strengths in terms of security ratings. either balance them out regardless of security. or raise all fw hubs to 0.8 / drop them all to 0.5.i know this is only really of relevance to those who are a part of faction warfare (and those corps exploiting this would hasten to disagree that this is a good idea) but everyone can think about this with a level head and see that it is bias. so please give your view.thanks,cap blart"
11/8/2010,"well, that's the lazy gallente navy for you. not defending their space because they're all still in bed at 11 o'clock in the morning..."
11/8/2010,"not supportedif you are trapped in your hub station, then get some of your militia and break out."
11/8/2010,"cannot be bothered to check out the exact ratio of which militia got how many stations in what sec systems. if it is heavily skewed though and not balanced between all 4 militias ccp should take a look at this. it is not like fw gets a huge amount of love from them anyway, so even minor tweaks will surely help."
11/8/2010,"since us players are not allowed to discuss moderation, perhaps the csm could attempt to do so for us.i propose the csm works with ccp to amend forum rules so they better suit the needs and expression of the players instead of the iron fist approach that is commonly taken.points that would be included:on patchdays, allow one feedback thread for each aspect of the patch instead of one thread for everything, in which nothing constructive can happen. getting pushed into one thread is like forcing us into an echo-chamber where our particular feeadback becomes negligible.when there is a controversy of some sort it results in page after page of locked threads. instead, those posts should be left open to allow the issue to run it's course, instead of having it dominate 3 pages of forum threads in general discussion.allow killboard links as long as the post has a minimal amount of content to go with it.generally make the forums more like the sandbox that the game is. the only real moderation that should be needed is to stop true spam, inappropriate language, and personal attacks."
11/8/2010,"the corp tab needs work, its outdated, its awful and it needs some help.i have no suggestions, i leave the particulars up to you - just make it better.thank you"
11/8/2010,"yay, more botting."
11/8/2010,watching good ideas sink in the sea of wrong that is the assembly hall makes me sad
11/8/2010,where is the surface on a gas planet?
11/8/2010,"at the distance from the center of planet where surface gravity is calculated. at least in eve. in reality it's matter of definition - most simple is some arbitrary level where pressure is ""x"" units. altho tbh with those distances between us as observers and gas planets for us they are kinda point masses."
11/8/2010,"under it's atmosphere.gas planets do have a surface, just not a solid one. think of it like the surface of water, but made of very dense gases."
11/8/2010,"in a gas planet there might or might not be a solid core below that layer. we've not found a way yet to determine this.if it's there the temperature at the surface would be in the order of 35,000 k and pressure around 4,000 gpa for your average gas planet. not an ideal place for a colony so best to assume the base is floating in the atmosphere.now go buy and read the algebraist. you can send me 100 m isk in thanks later."
11/8/2010,lol
11/8/2010,it has yet to be proved that a gas planet does not have a solid core.
11/8/2010,"you cannot prove a negative. as a previous poster stated though, at the depth where a surface would exist on a gas planet the environment is so intrinsically hostile that you wouldn't survive long enough to complain. best to just assume the gas harvesters are floating...you know,up where the gases are."
11/8/2010,"the csm have been discussing blobs and sov again recently and will be requesting a couple of sessions with ccp during the december summit. feel free to take part in the upcoming csm roundtable if you have ideas about this. as usual nailing down what the problem is becomes the primary requirement for coming up with potential solutions. for example, is 100 battleships a blob? if so, how about 10 super carriers? it isn't as simple as counting ships on each side from personal experience the term ""blob"" is thrown around so much it seems to mean anything from 2 vs 1 (seriously, we've been accused of ""blobbing"" people in a 2 vs 1 fight with similar ship types ) all the way through to the recent 2000 vs 1000 fights."
11/8/2010,"that's the issue and the reason that there is no actual problem. the term is 100% meaningless except as a snarl word. hayakawa referred to these as ""presymbolic noises"" that were pretending to be actual fully formed language. or as he put it: ""such statements have less to do with reporting the outside world than they do with our inadvertently reporting the state of our internal world; they are the human equivalents of snarling and purring. . . . to take sides on such issues phrased in such judgmental ways is to reduce communication to a level of stubborn imbecility.""nobody has or can define ""blob"" because it has absolutely no definition beyond ""something i don't like"" or ""more forces than the defenders have"" or ""better ships than the defenders have"". all of which are game mechanics functioning exactly as designed. there is absolutely no problem with ""blob"" anything, there is a problem with people complaining about types of combat that they're unable to adapt to and niches that they're unwilling to vacate once they're unable to compete. even a semi-decent metric such as ""enough ships to induce lag on a node"" is jabberwockian; i've lagged out systems to near unplayability by leading fleets of a dozen pilots. is a dozen pilots now a game breaking ""blob"" fleet? if the defenders of a csaa that's building a titan field 500 people, and the attackers field 500 people, and their ships are exactly the same but the node lags out, then even though neither has the slightest advantage, all of a sudden both are ""blobs"". the word is meaningless except as a snarl word. at least in through the looking glass style nonsense language we at least have context to give us semantic clues (we know what a frumious bandersnatch is even if we've never seen one). even in joyce's wake we can figure out how nonsense words are used in context (we know what joyce means when he says ""comeday morm and, o, you're vine! sendday's eve and, ah, you're vinegar! hahahaha, mister funn, you're going to be fined again"")but with ""blob"" the only actual semantic value it conveys is ""grrrr!"" we'd laugh if it was an industrialist complaining that he was being ""blobbed"" because his lone operation was in competition against an industrialist corp with 100 members and a huge mining wing. but involve guns, and all of a sudden it's serious business and something must be done! and it will continue to be used in exactly that manner, because ""grr, blob!"" is the eve equivalent of ""i dropped the ball because the sun was in my eyes and, also, you suck!"" short of wow style arena combat, if all other things are equal there will always be an advantage to being able to defend with more people/better ships than the attackers and attack with more people/better ships. it doesn't matter if you change sov, people will always have assets that they want to defend or attack. people will always have fleets that are larger than their opponents' fleets, and most folks are hardly going to start telling people ""leave fleet, we have seven more pilots than the enemy, and make sure that the ships that are left are a fair balance!""because ""blob"" has the semantic value of the null-set is really just a snarl word about people who can bring more/better ships than you, any discussions on how to ""fix"" blobs will really just be about using the csm to prosecute in-game grudges.a very, very bad policy to start."
11/8/2010,"blob isn't entirely semantic. considering ccp ought to know approximately how much their grids can handle, a ""blob"" in technical terms would mean a group of ships large enough to destabalize the node. ofcourse, with re-enforced nodes (or lack there of in some cases) this becomes variable."
11/8/2010,"limiting the number of people that can enter a system (node) will never work. if it's a hard limit then whoever shows up first wins. if it is a per side limit then one side may just split into two neutral forces , take the system to its limit and no one can enter. if it is per ally limit then one side will again use two or more neutral forces and do manual target screening or some other form of nip. the tendency of people to form up into a group will always be there. we can only offer some possible alternatives for smaller entities to have some effect. to spread the fighting out a little from the server crushing battles we have now due to sov focusing on a couple high ehp structures."
11/8/2010,"semantic, literally, means ""meaning"". so something that is semantic has meaning. my point is that ""blob"" has zero semantic value. zero meaning. it is a snarl word. it only means ""grrr!""and the metric of node stability is one i addressed. is a 12 man fleet a ""blob"", because i've lagged empty systems out with 5+ minutes of jump/module lag and only a dozen people in my fleet. it also presents an absurdity if we're talking about reinforced nodes and both sides have equal forces. if the defenders bring, say, 600 and the attackers also bring 600, and both sides have the exact same ships down to their fittings, then the node can still be significantly lagged out. what does it mean, then if both sides are ""blobs""? the term effectively loses all meaning if two sides have 100% identical composition and are 100% fairly matched, but we've still got ""blobbing"". nor are calls that either side should reduce its force particularly persuasive. if the defenders have something that they wish to preserve (let's say, just for argument, a dozen csaa pos's with titans in the oven, anchored in one system that are coming out of their reinforced timers at the same time). should we expect them to defend with even a single pilot less than they could? if they bring 300 players because they think that's a 'non-blob' and their opponents bring 500 and win, does that mean that they weren't ""blobbing""? if they bring 300 players because they think that's a ""non-blob"" and their opponents bring 150 and lose, does that mean that the defenders really were ""blobbing""?what if the node's stability sucks and it lags out pretty heavy in both situations, even when it's reinforced?and, more importantly, if the attacks aren't able to eliminate those pos's and baby titans, or the defenders aren't able to defend those pos's and baby titans, who compensates them for the opportunity cost of that lost ability? you? someone else? anybody, at all?of course not. it is, therefore, a demand that, in accord with a snarl word that's got the semantic value of the null-set, either attackers or defenders voluntarily sacrifice victory on the altar of appeasing a demand that can never possibly be met. there will always be someone who'll claim that two rifters versus one merlin is a ""blob"". i'd like to point something else out about this, as well. fleet a jumps into system 1 and fights fleet b, which has equal numbers, and it's reinforced and everything goes well. then fleet a jumps into system 2 and fights fleet c which is 1/2 its strength and/or system 2 is not reinforced, the system lags out. by some strange alchemy, fleet a is both a blob and not a blob.likewise, if fleet a has, say, 100 ships that have drones and fleet b has 100 ships that don't have drones, if fleet a deploys drones it will lag the system out a hell of a lot more than fleet b. fleet a, then, is not a blob as long as they don't deploy drones, but a blob if they do."
11/8/2010,"you're right, i should have said that refering to ""blobs,"" is not a game of ""semantics."" excuse me.but you have to admit, given the fact there are very quantifiable (if not somewhat complex) variables to mathematically decide how much the average node can withstand there is no reason not to assign relative values with a title, be it ""blob,"" or ""more than capacity.""i agree, there's absolutely nothing behind trying to enforce static limitations per node, but i disagree that is the only approach to discouraging node-crashing numbers of ships becoming a part of a single fleet. i believe the process to reform soverign warfare has to deliniate away from blobbing and look at the root causes of blobbing outside of creating ineffectual objectives. the root of blobbing directly related to how easily one can muster that number of pilots under a single banner. something i believe doesn't get a lot of attention (at least not the good kind)."
11/8/2010,"well yes, but it can vary from fight to fight and hour to hour, even in the same reinforced node. so even that metric becomes relative and somewhat subjective. let's say, additionally, that fleet a is heading to system 1 which is reinforced and in which it can fight an evenly matched opponent without undue lag. but on the way to system 1 it meets another enemy fleet in system 5, in which it lags the system out while taking no casualties. by this metric, fleet a is not a blob once it gets to system 1, but in system 5 it is a blob even though it has the exact same numbers in systems 1 and 5. this is my point, coming up with an actual definition that's workable is impossible. we can indeed talk about situational circumstances that leave specific nodes unable to handle certain fleets. but the issues presented haven't been ""make the nodes be able to deal with the fleets."" but ""try to find a way to stop people from using those horrible ""blob"" fleets!""outside of wow style arena battles, this will never happen in eve. so folks should accept the reality of the situation if they're going to keep on playing eve. all other variables being equal, numbers will be decisive. it's basic to reality/logic/human nature/mathatmatics/what-have-you that 3>2>1, and again all other variable being equal, 3:1 is better than 1:1 if you want to win.we've even had one person suggest that what we should do is remove standings themselves... which would simply lead to the same exact groups we see now, but they'd just have to add an additional column to their overviews. hardly a decisive change. it's just a function of emergent behavior in an evolving system with a population over a certain threshold. you cannot stop it except by gutting eve. ""hey, you like losing?""""no""""what a coincidence, i don't either.""""hey, do you like winning.""""yep.""""what a coincidence, i do too.""""hey, let's work together.""""okay.""this holds true for two people who play together and form a corp, two corps that play together and form an alliance, two alliances that play together and form a coalition...sure, there will always be some people who prefer small gang pvp, solo mission running, or what have you. and that's fine. different play styles should be allowed, of course. but what we see most now are people who are suited (by their numbers/skills/ships/whatever) to a certain style of play who object and want ccp to alter the game so that they can compete in a different niche. if someone doesn't want to compete with a group that can potentially bring thousands of players to bear, nobody is forcing them to. they can do many, many other things in eve. but once they do get to that level, they lose the ability to coherently complain. after all, a 3000 man alliance is ""blobbing"" a 1000 man alliance, but that 1000 man alliance is ""blobbing"" a 100 man alliance that wants to fight it, too. (which is, of course, ""blobbing"" a 10 man alliance that wants to fight it, which is in turn ""blobbing"" a guy who's playing solo)."
11/8/2010,"i think you've got a very defeatist viewpoint on the subject matter. i find ""impossible,"" to be a meaningless term when dealing with finite numbers. realistically, there isn't an exponential growth factor to the number of ships that are going to try and load a single grid. i think it's perfectly reasonable to try and quantify a mean figure for stability and worth with that information in-hand. there cannot be a complete disconnect between ""stop blob fleets,"" and ""make nodes be able to deal with fleets,"" when there are hardware or software limitations to be dealt with (be they short-term or long-term hurdles).once again, i dislike the wow tangent. i certainly hope nobody ultimately suggests instanced fleets of a very wow number of ships (what is their paradigm now, 20 players?). my argument is that the primary reason a ""blob"" materializes is very much supported by the strait-forward way in which an extremely large number of un-related players can tell one another apart from the enemy. even if there were work-arounds, the phsyical limitations of filling one's screen with overview columns seems to bear a reason itself. some players might not think that working with a group of thousands is worth it anymore. is that a static limitation? not really, but it is a step in the correct direction. this doesn't ""gut"" eve in any way shape or form. it merely creates a necessary level of confusion to discourage a player-driven need to condense into groups larger than the server can handle. the term ""blob,"" shouldn't be as relative as you make it out to be. blobs ought to be referred to (in this line of conversation) by their only meaningful value: numbers sufficient to crash a re-enforced node."
11/8/2010,"i think blobs are fine for null sec. huge fleet fights are a good selling point for the game. however it would be nice if ccp designed some game mechanics which didn't lend itself to blobbing. as far as reality: its not like in order to fight world war 2 the americans english chinese and russians all formed one big blob of troops and roamed around the world chasing after a great big blob of japanese german and italian soldiers. there are typically several smaller battles going on in different places. eve allows people to move into position before sov systems are taken. and this is for good reason, because people did things in game to get those assets. they should have an opportunity to defend them without having to be logged in all their lives. however more casual players should have a means to faster quality pvp. in fw there arent really big consequences to occupancy. accordingly it should be set up so that its just allot of fun. there should be many different places to defend with different types of ships. the fw complex idea is brilliant in that it restricts the size of ships that go in and makes it so you cant warp directly on top of your target. both of these mechanics are major accomplishments to prevent blobbing in plex warfare. however ccp also did some things with complexes that werent really that smart. if they make a few changes to the system it would be the best pvp in or out of eve. i have outlined some changes here:"
11/8/2010,"first, no, nothing defeatist at all. some things will work, some won't. and it's not a question of ""defeat"" either since i don't believe that open ended cooperation in an mmo is a bad thing. my saying that you can't make it so that people won't want to work together for strategic and tactical ends is a bit like me saying that you can't make it so that people don't like beer and/or sex. it's not defeatism. also, discussing the impossible is only invalid in an non-finite set (that is, an infinite one). in a finite set it is quite possible to define its nature and bounds, and be certain as to what lies within them. that's fine, but it also doesn't have anything to do with the subject at hand. let's just say, for example, that we find out that n is the ideal number of ships to have in a system in order to run properly. in order to actually act on that, however, we run into the problems that syx clearly described (as well as the simple counters that would invariably be used). and as i've pointed out numerous times, the 'sliding scale' nature of different systems, or even the same reinforced systems at different takes, makes this a meaningless metric. a 500 man fleet is not a ""blob"" if it meets another 500 man fleet at 1200 in a reinforced system that can handle the load. but by 1400 the system is littered with wrecks and abandoned drones, and now two new 500 man fleets lag the system out heavily, and suddenly they're both ""blobs"". to say nothing of the fact that, again, a 100 man fleet isn't a blob in the reinforced system, but if it moves to another system then suddenly it's a ""blob"". be that as it may, the wow comparison is apt and on-target. some people really do object to the basic dynamic whereby people can group together and put forward more numbers than fewer people. and we're not so far off from that exact proposal, either. you are altering game mechanics that are working exactly as intended in order to stop natural cooperation, and it won't do anything more than provide a bit of annoyance in terms of allowing groups to cooperate. you remove the ability for players to easily see who they're friendly and who they're hostile with, for people to decide who can and can not dock at their stations, for people to decide who their pos's will and will not fire on, etc...yes, it's gutting the game. just not as thoroughly as some more extreme suggestions. but as pointed out and elaborated on, even that metric changes can change rapidly in the same system, to say nothing of a fleet not being a blob in one system and the same exact fleet being a blob in the next system over. and as pointed out, using that as any sort of a limit is doomed to failure due to the factors that sxy has already addressed in detail."
11/8/2010,"i think there is much more to eve than you suggest. you're making it a good point to pump wow and alarmist rhetoric into your argument and i'm merely stating what i think is quite feasible for the design team to discuss in terms of making the quality of eve fleet combat go up without resorting to creating a grandios set of decentralized sov. objectives (in the vain hope players won't just re-group on one of them).i don't think i need to re-iterate what i posted above. it was fairly clear cut and i can sense that you understood my conclusion that the simplest possible solution was to stop trying to change how people deal with soverignty itself and instead change how they have to approach one another to build these soverign blocks that are creating fleets larger than node strength. that is not to say people are disallowed or discouraged to take the 'natrual' progression of gaining more friends and allies to fight with, but grabbing a random assortment of all-but-strangers togther is quite a simple task and i think that is the progenitor of most sov problems."
11/8/2010,"nothing alarmist and i've already described why wow is an apt comparison: the fundamental objection to ""blobbing"" is that people can cooperate past a certain small scale. wow obviates the necessity for that complaint in a way that eve never can, as player-driven content and cooperation is and always will be its central feature. of course i understood it, that's why i responded to it in detail and explained why it wouldn't work to effect change on the main issue and would have secondary, unintended consequences that would gut significant portions of the game that have absolutely nothing to do with fleet sizes (deciding who can and can not dock at your stations, for example). you can, artificially, claim that certain types of cooperation are okay, good, natural, what-have-you, but that doesn't put any logical force behind it. the reason for cooperation is a mutually desired outcome, not necessarily playing with your buddies. attempting to form sort sort of subjective cut off to enforce results based on a view of what 'good' cooperation is and what 'bad' cooperation is misses the basic point, especially of a sandbox game. the point isn't that there is player-created content but it has to be created by a group of players who might conceivably meet up for beers some day. i'd be happy to have a squadron of awesome sabre pilots who all have bad breath and listen exclusively to country music."
11/8/2010,"absolutely agreed. it makes actually for some fun moments when a roam of less than a single squad is accused of ""blobbing"" just because some clueless muppet got caught by them on a gate. otoh, for the sake of serious discussion on this matter it isn't helpful at all. apart from a rather fruitless discussion about mere semantics (see above in thread) and an official ""sizing"" of the ""blob"" by ccp (not gonna happen imho), some common base has to be found. even if it is a merely theorethical number and leaves much to be desired for most involved parties, you sort of need that common ground to make a discussion work. otherwise you'd just get talking people at each other about pears and apples. the only real indicator we got to deal with this, finding a ""common ground"" for discussion, is the limit to fleet size provided by game mechanics/ccp. if you do want to find a compromise to have a common denominator referring to what makes a ""blob"", ""anything above max. fleet size"" would offer itself. agreed, 256 players/ships is still a huge number for many, but it is the only ""hard"" limit imposed by game mechanics at all. and yes, i am aware you can form/coordinate multiple fleets. this would only be a theorethical ad hoc definition to enable discussion in any case."
11/8/2010,"there is no cut-off, you can make as many friends as you like. the only diffirence would be that you'll have to be aware of who they are rather than just the fact they have a given icon tint. there is nothing to detract from player-driven content in my proposal (hence why i used the term alarmist). you can meet up for beers with anyone you want, blue or not."
11/8/2010,"except, as pointed out, your proposal would simply lead to an additional overview column and significant unintended negative consequences like a total lack of control over docking rights in stations or pos's targeting profiles. and of course your proposal simply would not make you ""be aware of who they are rather than just the fact they have a given icon tint."" not even close. the only thing that changes is that fc's now have to keep a cheat-sheet next to them while they play or memorize a bunch of alliance tickers and instead of shooting reds, they shoot anybody without tickers x, y and z. or with tickers a, b and c. you're using the term ""alarmist"" as a smear. unless you're really arguing that not being able to prohibit your enemies from staging out of your own stations is doing ""nothing to detract from player-driven content"", or forcing your pos's to either fire on everybody not in your alliance or allow everybody, including your enemies, to camp out right in front of them. and so on. this is the fundamental problem; the law of unintended consequences guarantees that not only will your proposal not actually accomplish its main goals, but it will have serious negative ramifications for player-created content. to say nothing of the fact that if ccp actually takes the step of artificially trying to limit the degree of cooperation and brings eve closer in line with wow, it sets a very dangerous precedent. especially since your proposal would be wholly ineffective and would, undoubtedly, be followed by more calls that we must do something. in that manner each failed, damaging idea would be cause to iterate yet another one, because after all, it has to work sooner or later and/or it just wasn't implemented properly and/or people just didn't act properly and/or... do you really think that people would stop complaining about ""blobs"" and stop demanding change if your propsal went through, prohibited alliances from determining who docked in their stations or sat outside their pos's, but otherwise business as usual went on? or would they use that as a justification for an even more extreme solution? if your proposal was coded into an update tomorrow morning, do you think that it's allies, ra's allies, rawr's allies would all just pack up and go home? do you really think enough would to change the political landscape of eve?edit: unless of course your proposal isn't to get rid of standings themselves, and instead just the blue/red icon that goes next with 'em... in which case your proposal would have zero impact at all, as you've already got an option to sort your overview based on standings, blues still wouldn't even show up on your overview, but now they'd just be ""blues"" in name only. and instead of not seeing them and knowing that they had a blue icon next to their name, you'd not see them and know that they were blue but didn't have the blue icon next to their names."
11/8/2010,"to me, the 'blob' was never specifically numbers. it's the fact that there is little to no tactical value in most situations to moving your fleet in anything but said blob save for your 'scouts' which just jump to the next system and check local and your cyno droppers. with terrain being a nonfactor, line of sight not mattering, and friendly fire nonexistent save for a handful of aoe attacks it's one 'blob' of ships getting into range of another 'blob' of ships. in smaller numbers there's more room for the tactical maneuvering and usage of strategy that makes your group of 12 that lagged the system not a 'blob', but it could still very well be one if you just moved as a mass and focus fired.so, i'd say the call for reducing the blob isn't a call for reducing numbers, but for increasing the amount of thought and strategy fleet warfare takes beyond the fitting room and cta. hopefully that explains why people aren't so keen on agreeing with you that the blob is a natural part of the game, finn.edit - and of course the ones who *are* calling on number reduction and teamwork reduction are noobs and should gtfo. 300 didn't take place because of forum whining, it took place because strategy and tactics managed to minimize the effect of numbers. they still lost in the end due to numbers + tactics (the archers sneaking behind and whatnot) as it should be."
11/8/2010,"your definition of blob is highly idiosyncratic, however. and i'm not quite sure what you're arguing the problem is, then. can you clarify? if fleets are motoring around with sub-standard tactical acumen and individual pilots aren't taking the initiative and zooming around on their own (or what have you), then their opponents should have an easier time of butchering them, right? where's the problem?it sounds like your objection is more aesthetic than pragmatic, and i simply do not grok. can you please elaborate? how do you ""[increase] the amount of thought and strategy fleet warfare takes beyond the fitting room and cta"" other than by putting a fleet up against a tactically superior force that requires a significant alterations in tactics? and how does ccp get involved at all in this process? shouldn't forcing fleets to engage in more nuanced, inventive, individualistic tactics be the job of whoever is going to whip them good if they don't manage to adapt? however:doesn't really help at all, as i'm sure you'll agree that the vast, vast majority of people talk about ""blobs"" in terms of either numbers or negative effect on the server and your definition is certainly not in the majority. to be honest, it's the first time i've ever heard anybody, at all, describe a ""blob"" simply as a group that shows little individualistic tactical acumen. (sure, some people will probably add in a ""and their fc's suck and their pilots are all terrible!"" to a complain about someone who has greater numbers, too. but i've never, ever, ever heard anybody complain that they outnumbered their opponents 2:1, but their opponent had all their pilots aligned to the same point and was using fleet warps, so they were blobbing.)we do however agree about those who are calling for numbers/teamwork reductions"
11/8/2010,"many people forget that this is a game . they become very risk adverse with their internet pixels which encourages players to only fight when they will clearly win (there are exceptions, i'm generalising). there is safety in numbers so people cluster together, be it corps into an alliance or alliances into a nap. a definition of blobbing would be when multiple friendly fleets are required, but again that is too simplistic. a fleet of 250 frigs isn't the same level of ""blobbing"" as 250 bs, or even 50 supercaps.also there isn't anything that says you have to stay on the losing side, (and i'm not advocating there should be it is just an observation). this means that people can ""flip"" sides without issue or in some cases play both sides with alts.i'd love to see pilot skill have more effect in larger fights, rather than being reduced to +1 dps to alpha a target. but i'm not sure how that could work under the current ""shoot single huge hp structure 3 times to win"" system and with the level of lag that occurs when you have to do anything more complex than lock primary and hit f1 in larger fights.discussions continue and we'll see what ideas people come up with"
11/8/2010,"nah, people remember it's a game. but they also remember that it's got an awesome economy (some people who point to eve being a game forget that ). and so if you take your nice, shiny ships out and lose them lots, eventually the ships you can take out are much less nice and much less shiny, and the grinding you have to do to make more isk to buy new ships means that you have that much less time pewpewing. to say nothing of skillpoint loss with t3 ships... give someone a choice between ""spend at least 10 hours ratting/grinding isk to pay for the ship you are flying and might lose, or get killmails and keep your ship"" i think that many people would choose the latter. unless, of course, you are offering to pay for my losses, in which case i agree and i will get into fights much more carelessly. totally off topic, but this is a misnomer and it bugs the hell out of me. a nap is a non aggression pact. it specifies a simple lack of conflict. what we've seen that has many people really upset is a map, a mutually assistance pact. that, however, is just the nature of the game. sure, 1v1 interceptor duels are really nifty sometimes, but mathematics govern every level of eve. if you can get together enough ships such that they can one-volley an opponent, and you can kill their ships faster than they can kill yours, chances are you can destroy their fleet, loot the field, and achieve your objective(s). the way that pilot skill can generally have more effect in fights is to fight in smaller fights where the crushing burden of mathematics doesn't come down like a hammer.p.s. can you flesh out your description of ""blob"" fleets? if, say, i am a tyrannical alliance head and my alliance has 12 csaa pos's with 12 titans and they've all been reinforced and i want to save them, if i call for 300 pilots to form up and defend the system, and my enemy brings in 500, am i the one who's blobbing or are they? what if i see two other guys are fighting and each has, say, 200 battleships in their fleets but i want to be able to gank them all and i form up two fleets to go in and pound them, have they blobbed me or am i blobbing them?if i form up a fleet of 255 pilots and all you need to do to counter my fleet is to use a couple dozen bombers, am i not blobbing but if you don't have bombers on hand and have to use 255 + n pilots, am i back to blobbing? do the surroundings get taken into consideration, too? say, if you're fighting above a deathstar pos with many ecm jammers and the defenders don't need all that many people at all but you need a more than a full fleet to deal with their fleet plus the pos, has their pos effectively ""blobbed"" you? and is it necessarily a bad thing, in your view, if to ""blob"" means to field a fleet that requires more than one full fleet to counter? should ccp work to prevent people from fielding such fleets? if so, why? this is part of the problem, i think, in that the term ""blob"" really has no actual definition as it's used 99% of the time (and i'm not sure about the other 1%)."
11/8/2010,"tactics is positional and battlefield maneuvering, which eve is seriously lacking. my personal opinion is implementing line of sight, friendly fire, and shots that don't disappear if they miss would fix it without having to manufacture any pretend game mechanic to force people into some formation for a number bonus or random shiny. strategy is the overall warfare, choosing when, where, and with how much to strike, as well as the infrastructure behind your war. this eve does have but it's still limited compared to where i would like it myself. the infrastructure isn't my cup of tea to comment on, but when warfare generally promotes focusing all your efforts into one locale you're going to see concentrated forces, and as alliances get bigger those numbers get bigger. until this is fixed as the total numbers get bigger, the fleet sizes will always get bigger. the only way to combat that without getting some alien server technology is to encourage division of forces. if it takes 30 ships to successfully attack point a, and that group has 60 willing pilots with nothing better to do they're all going to come attack point a just to be sure. if it takes 30 pilots to attack said type of point, and it nets an advantage if both are attacked (without it being too easy to just wipe the first point with the 60 then move on) then the group is more likely to divide their forces. they still might not but that's life. tl;dr - you have to add both tactics and strategy or the fleet sizes only increase, with increasingly diminished pvp 'action' beyond activating modules and increasing lag. even then it might not fix it, but saying it's a nonissue is a bit much if only for the sake of player enjoyment.edit - and i'm not sure if i addressed your question finn due to this forums poor reply mechanics and it being 5 am. i'll look at this again later."
11/8/2010,"sir isaac newton is the deadliest son of a ***** in space. ahem.to be honest i simply don't agree as i've had fun in small, medium and large gangs with things exactly as they are. well... it is a non issue by most ways of looking at it. every single person who ever logged in for a trial account and stayed with eve did so, and enjoyed it enough to do so, without those changes. and many still evidently enjoy it well enough without those changes. to be honest, if i want a game like that i just load up freespace 2 and go blast the hell out of some poor shivan bastards. eve, from my point of view, is simply a different type of game. you are also, honestly, the first and only person i have ever seen who's said that it's an issue that there isn't true los or newton's first law in the game."
11/8/2010,"thanks for that, because my threads and posts arent limited to 1 character / section i will outline the main issues that i feel people are concerned about in regards to 'blobbing'in a game that prides itself on risk vs reward, the risk involved in having someone blue or red is political and poses no threat what so ever to a coalition. while i understand naps and confederacies can happen in strategic games players are aware that naping infinitely is what the problem is, no risk is ever involved in mass naping.the problem with this is alliances and coalitions can grow and grow and grow until eventually more than 50% of 0.0 is under one banner. this will go to 100%, now a few years ago no one would have expected it to be 50% but now since it is, we will see it @ 100%.when 0.0 is controlled by one coalition will people still be calm and relaxed about the mechanics involved in naping? even if things remain where 50% of 0.0 is under one banner things look so bad to the point where people are leaving 0.0 for whs or quitting altogetherprovidence is a great example of what 0.0 should look like, ofc some coalitions / alliances will grow more but when alliances mass nap everything in 50 jumps for 'safety' it kills 0.0 especially when powerblocks are so big they control half the mapthis is the first problem with blobbing which is directly linked to mass naping, ccp need to introduce a risk vs reward into naping, the same way there is a risk reward into almost everything else.strategies in huge battles are limited to ""who can get into the system first"", ""who can spam contracts / market while enemies jump in"" and ""who can crash the enemy making it free kills"".lets take lxq as an example, 2200 nc vs 1000 drone (approx), not to mention there was a nc fleet in a neighbouring system told not to jump in. this is only 50% of nc, the other 50% were busy with ev0ke, lag was fine @ 2900 when numbers increased things got messy, as far as smaller coalitions are concerned if lag is fine @ 2900 then it will be a while before lag will return (at least for reinforced nodes).historically when lag is fixed alliances / players try everything possible to beat the lag cap, this is a perfect example. the problem here is the strategy involved; in short lag was a direct creation of nc strategically to give them an advantage again.i will leave it at these two factors atm as i need to go out now but theres alot more, the increase of anti-blob / anti-nap whine is happening for a reason, the ironic thing is 0.0 alliances welcome empire to 0.0 and want people to leave empire but as far as i can tell the only place worth going to is heavily contested areas for example the south.i think the south is a perfect example of 0.0, theres large and small alliances who are obvious (not neutrals with benefits) friends and enemies but exist still, since the death of aaa and atlas many people have considered southern 0.0 as true 0.0 and the north as a cheap bad copy of macro empire.oh and because someone will mention and compare this to rl, in rl, food consumption, death, super weapons, biological weapons, destructible items (being able to destroy everything including stations and stargates) etc plays huge part of rl war. this is a game and is far from rl and in case someone says it, saying people do this because of human nature is like saying people do this because, human nature is split in a **** load of sections that i wont even go into again."
11/8/2010,"i think trying to define what a ""blob"" is or is not, is beside the point. the point is in eve it takes hours to find good fun pvp fights. 2 on 1 is obviously not a blob but if your in the same ship types it rarely makes for a good fight."
11/8/2010,"the problem is not blobbing it self , its a viable strategy.the problem is to how easy it is to assamble and manage blob.simple.try bringing 1000 people into wormhole system. not so easy to do it anymore , but still very much possible."
11/8/2010,"true that, because of the unique mechanics of a non-static access/exit route. and the non-viability of clonejumping. and cynoing into w-space. and prolly half a dozen other factors not coming to my mind right now. nice and well, but to adapt these specific mechanics even to a lesser degree to non-w-space...? sure, we/ccp could totally abandon clonejumping. brace for the incoming whinefest... and revamping/limiting cyno ability for capitals and supercaps will not really fix the problem either, just move the ""blob issue"" to exclusively sub-capital warfare. limiting access to any given system sounds easy on paper. but then you're talking about a massive breakdown of infrastructure if you were to adapt the same mechanics to non-w-space. all of sudden you cannot move your hauler/miner/ratting ship/whatever to the next system over because unfortunately 20 minutes ago a mid-sized roaming gang went that way? not going to work out well i reckon. this whole mess/problem/issue is exactly such a mess/problem/issue because way too many factors and game mechanics are intertwined there. the whole sov mechanics gimmick, general combat mechanics and not at least the somewhat skewed risk vs. reward ratio in battles. bringing ""the blob"" is a viable/popular/winning mechanics because with enough ships (of any type, tea daze, if you get just enough of those, frigates will do fine) you can ""do stuff"". which you cannot in many cases with a mere 10 ships (not talking 10 supercaps here obviously). adn that is, in my humble opinion, not the fault of the players or their stance, general attitude or that vaunted ""human nature"". it's game mechanics. one of the older memes of eve-o is ""adapt or die"". and that's what most people do at some point. on whose doormat is the blame to lie for players wanting to matter in 0.0 and thus ""blobbing up""? hardly their call that a lot of options these days vanish if you cannot bring enough firepower to bear. get a fleet of 200 together, then move them as a blob to do something somewhat ""meaningful"" (grain of salt there, for the sake of theorycrafting assume sieging a tower). then try the same after you split up that fleet into 20 units of 10 ships each. want to bet how much they can successfully take on? would be nice of course, if you had the tactical option to make the split-up fleet matter as much as ""the blob"". unfortunately, the lack of amassed firepower/tank/dps/whatever rules out many a venture straight away. and you can scale that up rather easily. basically same reason why people bring 1k+ instead of 200. as long as you can do much more damage and have the option to do anything (within sov mechanics e.g.) with a big blob, compared to split up little tactical units it is not going to change. mind me, i'm not belittling small gang warfare here per say, but did anyone recently succeed, say, reinforcing a tcu with a gang of 10?"
11/8/2010,"do you consider deliberately bringing more players than a node can handle ""fun"" ? even when you are well-aware that the target fleet is much smaller..."
11/8/2010,"this is the same nonsense as claiming that jump bridges or nullsec coalitions obviate risk. the risk/reward dynamic is exactly the same on a coalition level as it is when two pilots decide to cooperate. there's a risk of betrayal, under-performance, drawing in other hostiles who settle grudges, etc... it's telling that you're even at the point of claiming that setting people red doesn't involve any threat ""what so ever"". at the point where your argument deteriorates to arguing that having people who will shoot at you doesn't involve any threat at all, it's rather clear that you're using a rationalization to support a position that you've already arrived at and you're trying to retroactively find support for after the fact. 1. of course, you haven't provided any facts, at all, that ""50%"" of 0.0 is anything at all. 2. even if it was true, the claim that if 50% of 0.0 has a map, then we will see it at 100% is the most obvious sort of slippery slope fallacy i've seen in a while. i'd ask you to explain the chain of logic that goes from ""well, if half of a group is allied with each other, then absolutely all of that group will work together, with no exceptions!"" but since there is no valid chain of logic that gets from point a to point b before derailing violently, it's probably best not to ask. funny... out of all the strategies that've been discussed over channel command on teamspeak, in the fc channel on jabber, in the fc forum on any of the nc boards, strategic creation of lag wasn't ever mentioned. but seriously this isn't simple anti-nc ranting and you have logs of teamspeak meetings, or some such, right? actual proof?no?who'd a thunk it."
11/8/2010,is completely alleviated by the ability to out-pace a sever by deliberatly bringing many more than capacity.if that isn't part of policy then you wouldn't cta for thousands more than the opposition has in reserve and you certainly wouldn't attempt to jump them in system.i too find it quite difficult to believe that the nc or any other entity is claiming to be unaware of their numbers and just looking for good fights. if you wanted good fights you wouldn't bring a number of pilots sufficient to bring a node to it's knees at every opportunity.
11/8/2010,"i have been thinking of an easier way to describe blobbing and how its not the numbers thats the problem and always ended up with a wall of text, but you pretty much summed it up with the wh comment i really hope ccp and csm address this long going issue, i cant see how any alliance in the north would like the current mechanics considering how many players are leaving nc and moving south just for the hopes of having some pvp or going inactive."
11/8/2010,"found that proof yet, should be somewhere as you claim it exists. and you should have it since you made a claim that would've been based on proof if it wasn't a smear. so where's that proof hanging out? speaking of proof, large numbers of players leaving the nc? you have some proof of that too, right, it's not just something you're saying? and leaving to get pvp? what, near constant ops during major wars and riding bikes over half of eve aren't pvp, either? do you, perhaps, have proof that all the api generated killmails that the various killboards have, which show pvp going on, are faked? no? hrm. no. it's wholly possible for a fleet with massively superior numbers to simply blackscreen out while a smaller fleet farms them for kills. just like a small fleet can blackscreen out while a larger fleet harvests them. so do you have proof then, because your argument is logically unsound. once a cta is called, people show up. and then the fc's find fleets for them so they're not alarm clocking to get into the game, and then sitting around spinning their ships. as for jumping ships into a system, the dynamic behind your complaint is rather obvious. you're not complaining about the defender bringing massive numbers, just the attacker bringing numbers that can definitively defeat the defender. to say nothing of the fact that, even with perfect intel, you can never be 100% certain that your enemies can't raise reinforcements or that a third party won't take interest in the conflict and get involved. and as soon as you provide a quote, anywhere, of anybody saying that any entity claims to be ""unaware of numbers"", then that would be a valid topic of discussion."
11/8/2010,the assumption must be made that you're either unaware or purposefully node-crashing.what other logical conclusion can be drawn? did the leadership of 2000 pilots forget that even a re-enforced node wouldn't handle multipul thousands? do they fancy themselves in-game stress testers?the point is: it's completely illogical to assume that thousands of players would show up to one node (at this point in time) unaware of the consequences.
11/8/2010,"objective: defeat 400 pilots in system a.requirements: something greater than 400 pilots to ensure victory, but no more than 1600 pilots to ensure the sever does not destabalize.outcome: 3000 pilots enter system and node dies.explain to me how this happens accidentally."
11/8/2010,"1) have you seen the list of csm items in development for the next expansion? the stamp won't have enough space on it 2) there are over 150 issues raised by players and championed by csm in the backlog, you won't get all of those on a single piece of a4 unless you use a teeny tiny font3) break down the pallet of ""ignored"" proposals into duplicates, trolls and ideas totally unsupported by the playerbase and we have a deal i know many people will never be happy with the csm for various reasons. but like it or not the ceo of ccp specifically asked us to fly over for an additional summit to discuss a number of things. it seems the people who matter (those players who contribute to the csm process and those within ccp who make the decisions) feel there is value in what we do. haters will hate no matter what"
11/8/2010,"point 1 - as you said, they are not implemented but in developmentpoint 2 - again 150 items not implemented which maybe can go on a a4 piece of paperpoint 3 - ok i could have added duplicates, trolls and unsupported ideas to not discussed , ignored and used as paper aeroplanes/beer matsso obviously anyone outside of the csm process doesnt matter i would think everyone would matter the fanbois to the haters as they 'all' contribute in one way or the other, and why bracket this response as a hater, i dont hate the csm i just think money could be better spent without sending you guys out there for by all reports & accounts is argueing around a desk and drink huge amounts of alcoholbut as a poster advised earlier a job as a coat stand at fanfest or a coat room attendant (i remember having a helluva time finding my coats in the years i attended)"
11/8/2010,"due for release well before fanfest unlikely, even if you use duplex. the point is that players raised these proposals through the assembly hall, csm discussed them and added them to the list. it is counter productive to add duplicates and badly thought out proposals to simply clutter the list, hence point 3.sadly (and i blame the forum software) there isn't a very good way to search the existing proposals which means we get a huge amount of duplicated proposals.i wouldn't say they don't matter at all, however their views have less priority than the people who participate (even if that participation is negative comments on proposals. those views are frequently useful ). it stands to reason that the players who engage with the process get the most value out of it.i fully understand that people believe the csm process is a waste of time or money, partly because they see no tangible results. many people don't realise the amount of time it takes to get a feature implemented from idea to release (longer than a single csm session once ccp decide to schedule a feature) which adds to the ""what have you done"" questions of the csm. in addition the role of the csm has changed since csm4 to reduce the emphasis on purely raising proposals to instead include more discussion on upcoming features and ideas. of course there is also a pr aspect to the whole thing which we can't ignore.the best answer i can add for the worth of the csm that is that the senior eve producers have been in discussion with us for weeks about a few important issues and that the ceo valued our input so much he requested an additional summit. if he didn't feel it was worth the money to fly csm5 over for a 3rd summit this year then he wouldn't have asked would he? during that summit he personally spent over 3 hours discussing a great number of things with us."
11/8/2010,"well, my thoughts and opinion remain the same, as soon (as you put it) until i see some tangible results (how many years has it been sofar?, rather than points ive read in the minutes produced which appear to be a 'then v us' rhetoric rather than specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timebound agreementsthe few items that have been added sofar tbh are negliable ie;fully deployed: * summer: forum timer reduced to 2 minutes. * summer: view the fittings in ships in your hangar without boarding the ship (""view contents""). * summer: align to bookmarks.major issues seem to be still discussed and back logged on a continuous basis so ill close now and still re-iterate i dont think the csm in general is of no benefit however i do not believe whatsoever the gain outweighs the cost in a tangible sense especially with the state of gameplay re sov issues and that clickfest of pi (what were they thinking lmao)added to that ill also be quite impressed when issues raised by the players are treated with respect rather than the ones where csm has a personal/corp/alliance interest in - but again what can you expect from politicians in rl or game life ill close now as i think ive derailed the thread enough and for that i apologise - i still would like a cloakroom attendant though at fanfest if i go"
11/8/2010,"for most of the csm stuff i have been impressed, but my reasons for voting for csm were based on their priorities which have unusually been avoided and i am merely concerned about the consistency of csms, i think it would be great if pre elected priorities were mentioned at fanfest and compared to what csm have done or mentioned. it would definitely restore faith in ccp and players will see csm for who they are, lets see who wanted a free iceland trip and who wanted the game fixed and most of all who has stayed honest to their wordi for one would love to know why certain major issues have only been mentioned by a few csm yet ignored by others, i havent focused on last years priorities as much but i am well aware how blob warfare has been a constant issue with little or no discussion. i understand dominion was meant to fix most of the problems in 0.0 but clearly failed so i cant really mention about previous csms dedication and influence so i will just use this term as an example.plus since this is all political i am sure spending extra time proving to players how all (not just a few) csm have been dedicated and true to their word."
11/8/2010,"dear csm delegates,im writing to you today to request your help. i have seen the progress that you have made with ccp in prioritizing updates and new features for the eve community. like many others, we are impressed that you were able to dig so deeply into the corporate machine, that is ccp, and bring about change that the community has demanding for so very long.in the next csm term, i request that delegates make improving the corporation management game mechanic a high priority. i understand that this issue is not a low hanging fruit issue; however, it is an issue that needs to be addressed. as the system is now, corporation management uses a poor implementation of the role based access control model. you must go through endless pages of roles and rights and click trough a sea of check boxes to enable privileges to corporation members. this can get quite confusing after a while as you lose track of what privileges you have enabled and disabled especially when the privileges can get quite complex. on top of all this, ccp has a second management system based on the mandatory access control model. this compounds the confusion by adding roles and rights on an individual level as well.my request is simple; update the corporation management system so it is more in line with other usable systems like those found in forums and/or content management systems. a good example would be the user management system found in phpbb3. these improvements should be extended to the title system as well; to allow ceos and directors more flexibility in assigning customized titles to members. furthermore this system should also be extended to the alliance management system so that corporations can be managed much in the same way individuals are managed on a corporation level. i hope that this post gets the ball rolling in the right direction and that progress can be made before the start of the next expansion.thanks for your time,zen"
11/8/2010,we have a proposal in the backlog for an overhaul of roles and grantable roles which is still on our radar and has been discussed a few times recently.sadly like other changes that touch so many other parts of the game it is likely to be a difficult thing to get implemented but we'll bring it up again at the december summit. it is our hope that eve gate can be extended to bring some of this management out of the game client (the current corp ui is utterly horrible) but that might be wishful thinking for now.
11/8/2010,"thanks for your post, zen. i second what teadaze said...it was discussed at the june summit as well. ccp is aware of the need for a revamp but it's apparently a very big project that can't just be done in bits and pieces. all we can do is keep bringing it to their attention. fwiw, if i could only choose one ""big revamp"" ui project for ccp to work on, the corp management stuff would be it."
11/8/2010,"do people who say ""omg this would take codin!"" actually have any experience with coding?having done actual game programming before, something like the change suggested is mostly one or two variable calls and a formula. ogod teh coodinzthat annoyance aside, all you need to do to make eccm useful is have it reduce the effect any ewar has on you (aside from ecm which is already effected by the sensor strength). personally i think the scan mechanic should be changed to the prober's sensor strength versus the target's signature, with cloaking effecting the probed signature while not eliminating it completely save for possibly covert ops cloaks.my two cents on the issues."
11/9/2010,"supported again, change pos' into modular systems like t3 cruisers"
11/9/2010,still no fix so im going to start bumping daily
11/9/2010,"no.and i'm going to let my money do the talking. if they do push forward this remap for plex business in incursion. they can expect to see my subscription canceled until this feature is removed, indefinitely if that is the direction they're going to take this game. if ccp is having money issues,(which i find hard to believe) raise the subscription fees, you will loose subscribers obviously, but you will lose more, and eventually the majority of the player base, by making this game a cheap mockery of it's former self."
11/9/2010,"no.one of the reasons i started paying for a subscription to eve online was because it did not have the microsubscriptions. it starts with stupid little things like clothes and hats and what-not. but then someone will infiltrate something like a new module or 2. then a new ship, then this, then that. pretty soon, in order to even be competitive you have to pay extra for extras.if a game can't stand on its own with its base features, then it deserves to fail. can't tell you how many times i have played a demo or trial sub in a game only to find out couple weeks later that if i want to do more than kill sewer rats or be cannon fodder for more advanced players, i have to fork over (more) money.want that fancy +1 attributes hat? give me $$$! need the more advanced ship to clear that mission so you can get the pass to the black market? give me $$$! here's your pass. but wait! all the items in the bm are microtransactions!"
11/9/2010,"no.some of us remember the various promises you made at fanfests and in blogs throughout the years and you have a terrible record for keeping your word ccp and yourr core player base remembers.put in mt (its already there with plex imo - which you also said would never happen once) and you completly turn you back on the 'sandbox' that is eve and you will lose everything.i know you ahve vampires coming and are not afraid, but that does not mean we have to like it."
11/9/2010,[nope]
11/9/2010,"like i said, care to elaborate?i'll elaborate. assault ships already have a 4th bonus. it's resists. someone already explained that just a few posts above yours. go check it out."
11/9/2010,"i support some sort of change, as the current mechanic allows for extreme amounts of exploitation.station games indeed see the most egregious use of neutral rr ***giness, but even alts in non-allied corps should suffer some sort of prolonged consequence.i think at the very least the 1m redock timer should be in place. this would eliminate a vast majority of the opportunistic station gankers, as they are spineless in general and would not engage in such behavior if there was actual risk of them getting their logistic ship popped."
11/9/2010,"] teadaze > failed 1 for, 8 againstyou see - learn other weapon"
11/9/2010,good thing i have the fotm pulse lasers now...
11/9/2010,i totally support these ideas.
11/9/2010,supported
11/9/2010,"not supported while there are so many outstanding game play issues that need huge amounts of work. once those are finished, perhaps."
11/9/2010,i support this.
11/9/2010,... have you looked at railgun sizes vs projectile sizes lately?a 425mm railgun is a max sized battleship turret.a 425mm autocannon fits on a cruiser.i think it's a safe bet projectile rounds are bigger.
11/9/2010,"rail charges are accelerated to many times the speed of projectile charges, the cartridge must contain a significant amount of propellant to make this happen. in addition, in order to pack near the same energy they need to be much larger (hence the 1400mm vs 425, etc. both sizes are pretty arbitrary and ridiculous but whatever.)particle blasters similarly don't need to fire as much ...stuff... at the enemy. consider1kg 95+% u235 projectile - 88,250,000 mj1kg d2 fusion projectile - 576,000,000 mj1kg matter-antimatter annihilation - 90,000,000,000 mj"
11/9/2010,"what? railgun charges don't contain any propellant. they're fired from railguns. do a google search for railguns. you'll like 'em.also if you look at the measurements and graphics of the different ammunition in-game, the projectile rounds should be way bigger than hybrid charges, based on the listed diameters, and the proportion of length to diameter shown in the graphics."
11/9/2010,"those numbers are not really relevant, because railguns don't use fission, fusion, ot antimatter charges. they take energy from the ship's capacitor (whichever way it got tere) and use it to accelerate a chunk of metal. the hunk of metal melts partially during acceleration, which is why it looks cool the way it does, and hit it's target. no explosives involved. (except for antimatter ammo). as much as i enjoy discussing the rp perspective of this, could we focus on the effect it would have on game play?"
11/9/2010,100% support on all 6 points. excellent work bringing all the issues together. it's easier to grasp the extent of the hybrid problem and possible solutions in this format.
11/9/2010,"honestly, hybrids just need to do something different. lasers have high dps, missiles have higher (but lagged) dps, projectiles have alpha strike, hybrids have... effectively no niche. from a balance standpoint, sure, what the op suggests would make them better. honestly, i think the hybrid ships are a large part of the problem."
11/9/2010,"while gallente ships are certainly part of the problem, hybrids themselves being fixed would go a long way toward making them better in my eyes. as it is now, the only gallente ships i fly anymore are drone boats.i mean when you think about it, gallente ships suffer from the same 'lack of a niche' that their weapon system suffers from. they don't armor tank as well as amarr, but they're not as fast as minmatar. what you end up with is a ship sort of half-assing it, not quite fast enough, not quite tanky enough. the other races ships are more specialized for their purposes.anyway, i agree with the op's proposed changes. i especially like the idea of shorter reload times, rails that damage both armor and shield simultaneously, and better tracking."
11/9/2010,"i agree that ammo changes could allow hybrids to really be a hybrid.i suggested something similar to the projectile changes (3 range groups) but rather than damage type flexibility (as you get with projectiles) you could have different tracking and firing speed (adjusting the alpha for similar dps) within each group.this would allow you to pick slower firing ammo to give more alpha (with less tracking), a faster firing ammo with less alpha (but better tracking) or a jack of all trades with no tracking or refire bonuses within each range band.i also suggested 5 second reload to allow changing from long range to short range ammo to give better situational flexibility.cap use should be looked at as should the ammo sizes.now that roflkits have been looked at i think it is time for hybrids"
11/9/2010,"i actually didn't think about that,tand i think it's a great idea. nobody sane will spend 10 seconds reloading for 5% more optimal- it usually isn't a deal big enough. you don't see much difference between uranium and plutonium charges. there is little difference between thorium and lead. tracking and firing speed could, on the other hand, be immensely useful. mind if i add it to the original post?"
11/9/2010,"first off, thank you for posting a well reasoned topic with some positive changes.1this argument actually holds a great deal of water and i'm pleased you brought it up, because its something i didn't really notice before.2i like this idea alot. hybrid reloads absolutely slaughter the dps of gallente ships.3i'll up you one more step and say the whole sig radius algorithm needs revising so that blasters work without being broken and able to hit orbiting cruisers. the tracking issue is a tough problem because the math really isn't well understood. it seems to me that even though sig radius is supposed to simulate a larger target area, it's really just an abstract number and what the formula is really working on are two euclidean points. this needs to be revised to take into account how large a battleship orbiting at 2500m would actually be in terms of surface area to a tracking turret. it would take up a large portion of the sky in terms of arc-seconds and would likely be extremely easy to hit.4i think ccp are working on some t2 ammo tweaks but i have no idea what they have planned. i feel that blaster boats should be focusing far more on optimal range - the falloff bonuses given to many hulls are quite nonsensical. blasters should have a very low falloff as realistically, the plasma from the charge would lose cohesion rapidly.5i don't know if hybrids necessarily need to be 'better' score-wise than projectiles but blasters in particular need some kind of clear advantage for the risk involved in getting a gun platform into range in order to do damage.also hats off to teadaze for being the first csm type i can remember who's touched the hybrids issue. thanks :)*edit*this is a very good idea also. i remember when i was first learning eve and wondered why the hell there were so many different kinds of hybrid ammo that did absolutely nothing. afaik the only types that are used are antimatter, lead and sometimes i personally use iridium for range, because let's face it.. the t2 ammo sucks horribly and iron hits like a wet noodle.i keep coming back to wishing that railguns also had some kind of shield-piercing or shield bleed capability... perhaps that's something that could be done to buff the long range t2 ammo when it gets looked at."
11/9/2010,"as much as i would enjoy shield-piersing, and i am afraid that it might be overpowered. i mean, if you have a drake with 700 dps passive tank, and a ceptor/af with rails tackles it and kills it just by damage bleeding through shield, is that fair? i am not sure"
11/9/2010,"lots of awesome ideas here and i totally agreed with that hybrids need fixing badly but its not just them its also the ships that use them that for example have very hard time staying in range for the blasters to hit so in short fix the whole gallentean race look at all ship's stats, bonuses, how much its is used and for what etcespecially the diemost and the ishnotfittingtar(ishtar) need some luve also missiles on gallente ships are...just not right ~o~edit:yeah and fix the most important part about gallente ships being the slowest with the shortest guns that just does not fit i.e.make gallente ships the fastest yes that means faster than minmatar ships ps: don't fear to make hybrids overpowered as they have the most penalties of all weapons so (ammo use, cap use,) so in return they should be better then the others"
11/9/2010,"feel free to add it as another possible fix. i haven't quoted numbers etc because that is something for game design to look at. however i would say the max alpha from a railgun should be less than an arty for example and that a blaster should have the highest dps of any gun at point blank range.as with all csm proposals we can't promise ccp will implement the exact solution provided here, think of them more as guidelines."
11/9/2010,"1. the drawbacks of ammo size can be intentional because of other strong-points of hybrid weapons (there are no strong points, i would like to change that first)and roleplay reasons can be easily fixed, like, the unstable material contained in the charge needs a very large, powered protective container for transport2. like the idea, as a general game change to make weapons more diverse, change load times of hybrids to 5 seconds, and also change missiles to 20 seconds (also double the capacity of missile launchers)that way we have 4 flavors of weapon systems based on another factor, currenty we have normal systems and overpowered lasers judging by this characteristic3. tracking is a major problem for blasters, mostly caused by the great speed (web) nerf, webs got nerfed by 50% and now blasters are realy unfairly underpowered, they need an almost 100% boost to tracking just to bring them inline with the pre-nerf status, which would mean that you can hit things if you web them, still cant hit anything not webed... also all weapon systems got hurt by the web nerf, so the number shouldnt relay be 100%, but still, atleast as much that a bs can hit another bs while orbiting it4. agree, simple math 25% on half plus another 25% on the other half is not a total of 50%, it's a total of 25%, so yes that needs changing to 40%, regardless of any other changes to hybrids 5. agree, blasters need a major dps boost, current status is that you get maybe 20% more dps in exchange for something like 4-5 times smaler range. exact number for dps boost needs to be thought out carefuly, and also depends on point #3, if they get a tracking bost, then a minor dps bost is needed, and if they dont get the tracking boost then their dps should be insane, because you cant hit anything anyway6. rails are wierd, the main problem is that they suck at medium ranges, wich is a problem for galente pve, because at pve ranges of 20-70km acs and pulses double the dps of railguns with better tracking. for pvp they can be used as snipers on extreme ranges, and then work mostly fine. i cant propose a good solution to them"
11/9/2010,"imma kill myself. i just cross-trained amarr bs and guns to all 5 as i hate how useless hybrids are, and now everyone's on the ""improve hybrids"" train. god damn. i'm all for it, but it couldn't have been 3 months sooner no?"
11/9/2010,the omen has **** poor fitting skills and i can easily fit tech 2 guns on all the other races gun cruisers why not on the omen too?you can get 5 t2 fmp's fitted with an mwd and plate but that does require max fitting skills and a acr
11/9/2010,"heh, over the past 3 years i've been playing the game, i must've made like 5 topics about boosting omen's fitting stats, all i could ever get was a bunch of replies with that one ***got omen build with an ab and a bunch of resistance plating on battleclinic or the one with beam lasersit's awesome that this finally kicks in, an omen with a rack of medium pulses, 800mm and a mwd is something that would easily become my favourite cruiser"
11/9/2010,"oh lol, how stupid are you? i'm sure caracal/moa/vexor/thorax/stabber/rupture all need filler items like adaptive nano platings because they can't fit anything, you can't fit tech 2 guns/mwd/800mm plate no matter what on perfect skillsit's like, this ship is fiiinnnnneeeee, you only need perfect fitting skills to fly a basic tech 1 setup, forget about rigs, though and don't put tech 2 stuff in it or teh univers asplodes, ksrsly, this ship had 4 turret hardpoints back in the day, now it got 5th to deal competetive dps, but no one bothered to calculate how much that actually requires to fit, so it was a mistake, just fix it, there's no reason to argue over this"
11/9/2010,"wow! the emorage in here is awesome. these are t1 cruisers at the end of the day and your trying to shoe horn all that t2 gear onto it. i'm not saying that you shouldn't be able to fit t2 gear to t1 but it is difficult, it requires a lot of skilling, and in the end still probably requires some kind of fitting mod/rig.i am honestly for boosting ships when required. especially fitting requirements but when i can't see anything wrong with a ship i am going to say no.oh, and yes, those are expensive guns. use your brain and fit the nest ones down if you can't afford them"
11/9/2010,"your aurgument fails so you turn to insults...good job there buddy, you are almost at a five year old maturity levelnope the other t1's mentioned in this thread fit fine, it's just this one.so required is what...how bout when it is the least flown direct combat cruiser. thats usually a hint. the next ones down happen to be five mil, your grasp on market concepts seem to be as bad as your eft-fu. the ones before that won't fit with early to middle skill level and a large portion of your fit was meta 4 and costs millions. again for a starting level cruiser try not to make it more expensive then the navy version.at the cost you describe it would be cheaper to buy and fit a prophecy or harbinger.but go ahead and make more assumptions and link more overpriced eft fail fits. it only serves to bring home what 90% of people in this thread agree with, and bumbs it to relavence for new people."
11/9/2010,"well and the caracal, both that and the omen require more fitting mods for a tech 2 fit than any of there equivalent cruisers. vexor needs no fitting mods to t2 fit, neither does the arbitrator, stabber, bellicose, blackbird, celestis (probably spelt wrong), only the caracal and omen."
11/9/2010,"at least it has the assualt fit and the heavy sniper fit...but it is sad that the caracal can not run a ham+lse+mwd w/o fitting mods, like the 220mm+lse+mwd stabber can and the 800mm+mwd+electron vexor which can load three to four types of drones.kinda sad the first true ham ship you get is the drake. it is an excellent cruiser weapon and caldari's main weapon and it can not be fit.so much balence so little threads"
11/9/2010,saw all these thumb up pics and wanted to do one to... on a more serisos note i thing this is a good idea...scorpionidae
11/9/2010,"well tbh the omen has a sniper fit too - see below. the problem is that it can't fit hbls even without a tank and with fitting mods.but imo the bigger problem is that it lacks the saving grace of the caracal's amls: quads should be pulse lasers, not beam lasers.so i'm supporting but i'd like to see quads transformed to pulses, with the relevant changes in range, damage and tracking.[omen, beams]5x focused medium beam laser ii (aurora m)y-t8 overcharged hydrocarbon i microwarpdrivelarge azeotropic ward salubrity isensor booster iiheat sink iitracking enhancer iif-aq phase code tracking subroutinesdamage control iireactor control unit iimedium anti-em screen reinforcer ilow friction nozzle joints imedium energy burst aerator i** low skilled characters can change this to a shield rig and it should fit with awu iv."
11/9/2010,"to be quite frank i really like the caracal, it performs great in the right hands and along with the stabber it's a compact little cruiser that flies like a slightly oversized frigate, i'm really happy i have this kind of ship option in gamebut if someone's looking for a brawling missile t1 cruiser i'd see a problem, since caracal is the only candidate"

11/9/2010,"here's the thing--if u're a new corp planning to pirate in low sec and u can't even survive against just your war targets in high sec, how would u survive in low sec, where everyone is a potential threat, let alone 0.0? there r still plenty of corps out there that accept newbies and the only reason ppl war dec u is if u provoked them in some way. and smacking in local is reason enough, especially if u can't back it up or handle the consequences."
11/9/2010,"my corp was wardecd because we killed a stupid ninja salvager. ""provoke"" is just a loose term in eve, especially at the price of 2 million (or 10 million if you are already at war with 4 other corporations). i have been wardecd over stupid things, and at 2 million, its just easier to do so. towards new guys, normally any pvp corp will accept new guys with at least a little backbone and the urge to destroy everything in sight (within reason). i claim shenanigans if some corp requires some x million skill points before a person can join. if you have a good cooperative attitude, you can get in. and in hindsight, don't make a newb corp if your corp is filled with newbs. join an older corp, get some skill in, learn a few things and once you have some experience then open a new corporation. you don't open a shoe store if you have never sold shoes before (durh...common sense).once again, this just reinforces the fact that 2 million is garbage for a wardec. older/more experienced corporations can easily afford 100 million if they split it down the line. even if its just seven people in a corporation, that is only less than 15 million a person a week. whether or not if it should stack to be at war with a completely different corporation is up for discussion. maybe 25-50 mil for an extra wardec cost for initialization which stacks."
11/9/2010,"i get what you're saying anna and i don't disagree. hell, i think too many corps make the move to low sec too quickly without learning everything they need to know to survive down there and that ends up in many a dissolved corp. like i said, i'm not against high sec war decs. if one newbie corp wants to dec another and fight it out, i'm all for it. but as of late, its turning into a damned decageddon. the issue is 3 pronged. you have pvp corps decing high sec noob corps for easy kills, noob corps hiring merc corps for revenge against other noob corps and just plain dc griefing where you dec a noob corp just to make em hide out in dock. sure, the dec'd corp can always go out and fight, but some 3 monthers in caracals aren't going to do much against a corp with 3 times the members, 10 times the training and 20 times the pvp experience, flying t2 and t3 ships. that kind of crap just murders the learning curve which is already extremely deep in eve as it is.all i'm saying is that if you want to have fun at the expense of a corp that can barely fight back just because you want reward with little risk, then you should be offset by a higher price tag. it won't stop those with money to burn and it won't stop those who really want it regardless of the cost but it will hopefully cut back the amount of grief deccing and encourage more corporate growth which we need to keep the eve economy flourishing.every noob corp allowed to flourish now is a much richer target further down the line."
11/9/2010,so you would support removing level 4 missions from highsec?
11/9/2010,why not just increase the payout (not lp) when running level vs instead of nerfing level ivs in high sec?
11/9/2010,"in regard to my last response to lordelfa boosting level vs doesn't remove level 4s from highsec, and imo if your running level 4 missions your not a newbie or ""tinkering"".as far as i'm concerned for an mmo to be a real sandox pvp game, every real isk faucet into the game not specifically directed at starter characters should come hand in hand with an open pvp environment. this was the case with uo before the split, with shadowbane, darkfall, mortal online and probably every other sandbox mmorpg worth mentioning. while i'm not arguing here that any of those games were great, they all had/have problems, it's apparent that eve despite claiming to be cut from the same cloth in reality seems to be a lot closer with pve themepark games of the eq/wow model when it comes to pvp & pve dynamics. every argument i make here on these forums is to move away from that to a more true pvp sandbox model, your suggestions on the other hand aim to make things even worse and take things even further towards the themepark style of mmo where pve is separated from pvp.lets face it, players like you and players like me will never agree, because we want fundamentally different games."

11/9/2010,how if i may ask does this apply to my proposal
11/9/2010,because you're trying to apply real life definitions to a game. please please don't do that.
11/9/2010,what is the difference between a gauss cannon and a rail gun?
11/9/2010,"gauss cannon is also known as a coil gun, high direct current is switched through a coil or sequential coils, and the magnetic projectile is pulled between them by the induced field. the coil is switched off when the projectile reaches it so that it is accelerated instead of slowed.railguns consist of two charged rails that have a conducting projectile placed between them. the projectile conducts huge currents (basically shorting the rails together) which generates large magnetic fields around each ""rail"". since the current flow through the projectile is perpendicular to the magnetic field generated by the current in the rails, the projectile is accelerated in the third axis. railguns tend to propel the projectile somewhat with a charge before energizing the rails, as the high burst current (in some cases >300a) can flash-weld the projectile to the rails if it is not moving fast enough to spread the heat.magnetic force is generated by moving charged particles. take your right hand and stick your thumb out and curl your fingers. your thumb represents the direction of current travel and your fingers represent the magnetic field direction around the conductor.also see: inductors, magnetic force on current carrying wire, magnetic force on charged particles, etc.also not supported because proposal is bad."
11/9/2010,>> implying that a fictional world must abide by the rules of the real one there are much better things to be complaining aboot.
11/9/2010,so one of the hybrids uses a coil instead of rails...doesn't change the effect and creating there own group for a high meta gun seems a bit over the top.just means we have a coil gun.
11/9/2010,someone explain how a damage control works. in real world terms. :)
11/9/2010,"damage control rlthe one in our ship mostly use robots and nanobots instead of people running around like wwii warships, but the principle is the same. it cut oxygen inflow to burning compartments and instead sent fire extinguishes gases or open them to the space, seal bulkhead leading to damages areas, re-route power to secondary circuits when the primaries are damages and so on."

11/9/2010,"them meta 3 railgun is named ""coil gun"", witch would make it use coils?witch would also make it a second gauss gun?so that one needs changing alsoand since this is the asembly hallnot supported because the op is probably the only eve player that cares about thatand also because there's a lot of unrealistic elements to this game, in case someone didnt notice"
11/9/2010,"i fail to see why anyone would rat in a system without sov even nowadays.it's pretty simple, imo. change local mode to delayed for all of eve. local shouldn't be an effortless intel source."
11/9/2010,"full discolosure: i am a stealth bomber pilot. i still think sb pilots need some kind of enemy to keep us on our toes.when i'm not playing eve i'm usually playing u-boat simulators, and in those games my worst enemy is the destroyer - possibly one of the least popular ships in eve. my proposal is that this ship type should be made into the dedicated cloak hunting ship, through the use of one or two new modules.the first module should be equippable only by destroyers or destroyer hulls (although they might be overpowered on an interdictor), and when active would look something like an interdiction sphere, perhaps with a range of maybe 30-40km - this sphere would not have any direct impact on ships within it. here's what would happen: you're in a destroyer with this module active, and a cloaked stealth bomber strays within. immediately on your overview panel (but not in the gamespace) you see ""purifier 29km"" appear. you now know that a stealth bomber is within your spehere and can send a warning to your fleet. however, you cannot lock the sb due to its cloak, and you can not see the bomber in the gameworld, so you don't immediately know which direction it's in.now the hunting phase begins.a secondary attribute of this module (or perhaps a feature of a second module) would be a ""mass simulator"". as any cloaker knows, passing within 2,000 meters of another object in space will decloak you. the mass-simulator module would (only when active) have a range of maybe 5km and would basically act as a spherical object of that size - so that any cloaked ship which comes within 7km of it is decloaked. this mass simulator would consume large amounts of cap (think mwd cap drain), so that it would be used specifically for active hunting and not as a passive deterrant.with these two modules working together you could firstly detect the presence of a bomber, and then by flying your ship small distances in various directions could determine the general direction of the offending cloaker. then, either your destroyer or squad mates in interceptors with mass simulators could burn in that direction and have a greater chance of decloaking and (hopefully) killing the enemy.i think this concept, or something like it, would make things interesting for both sides because it's not a simple ""push butan decloak bomer"" ability, but would challenge both sides to try and outwit the other. it would give destoyers a specific role (which, as ships made to kill frigates, they are already suited to) but would still allow brave or cautious sb pilots the chance to try and evade the detection spheres and make their attack run regardless.let me know what you think."
11/9/2010,"i actually like this idea. it will force sb pilots to stay on their toes when near enemy ships, but if they safe up away from normal warpable objects, they can still perform other duties like gathering intel, and sitting afk in a system to annoy the farmers.the only problem i see with it is that it makes slipping past a gate camp extremely difficult, since it wouldn't take much math to figure out the optimum arrangement of ships to cover the entire 12k warp in sphere with anti-cloak. however as your proposal specifically says stealth bombers, this would still allow covert ops and blockade runners to slip through, so that might still be ok.also, there would have to be some distinction between active cloaking (i.e. i turned on my cloaking device) and passive cloaking (i.e. i just jumped through a gate). the module should only affect active cloaking, but i don't know if the game engine makes a distinction between the two.i like the idea, but i'd like to see it further refined before i offer support."
11/9/2010,"a ""stealth bomber"" pilot...creating a ""stealth-nerf cloaking"" thread? riiight... what about cloaking transports, covert ops frigates, or force recons? they chose to fly them instead of their non-cloaking counterparts for a reason.there's no outwitting anyone here at all. it's still gonna be the same gate camp this, burn towards the cloaker asap, and blob him to death, only u want it to be easier. u want easier ganks, adapt and get a heavy interdictor bubble."
11/9/2010,there are a few problems with your idea. 1 just because a stealth bomber is fast and cloaky does not mean that everything that cloaks is fast and cloaky transport and recons. also the man people that fit cloaks to hacs to ninja into 0.02 if a dessy could uncloak things 7k form it then all you would need is 5 or 6 to cover most of the gate anything that jumps in cant cloak3 anti stealth bomber already exist. we call them dramiels and taranis' 4 and the 0.0 proof t3 a tengu that cant be stopped by bubbles can cloak and cant be scanned down. your anti clod thing will make a lot of caldari ninja carebears sad
11/9/2010,"not sure yet.i like your first idea, it is interesting for both sides without being to overpowered. (though you might consider to make the cloaky ship appear on dscan for the destroyer pilot when it appears in his overview)your second idea might be a bit difficult to implement without shutting down gates with it.what about a 3sec anti-cloak pulse with 7km, but also with a 17km falloff that neutralizes any other anti-cloak pulses?(just to clarify this: 7km decloak every 3 secs, and no other anti-cloak pulse within 40km in the 3 secs following the pulse)p.s: if someone thinks that cruisers/indus with cloak should not be affected by this, another t2 cloak could be added, which is immune to anti-cloaking but needs like 75 powergrid."
11/9/2010,"check out my stats on battleclinic if you don't believe me. i don't have thousands of kills, but:i don't want easier ganks, i want an exciting game.thanks to everybody else for the comments. this isn't a well refined idea, i was just thinking about what makes the stealth bomber idea compelling to me, and how it could be made more interesting and dynamic. there are obvious problems - i hadn't considered the effect it would have on (for example) blockade runners or recon ships - mainly because i can't fly those yet.back to the drawing board i guess."
11/9/2010,amen!
11/9/2010,not supported here. i'll give it a very vehement vote for no.
11/9/2010,finally i can post here and say...**** no!
11/9/2010,well how about you can condition clones to be dependent on race. so a perticular clone would have the amarr racial tiers and then another clone would have gallente. that way it won't matter what your starting race is.
11/9/2010,or...we could leave it as is and not have any problems switching ships on the fly.
11/9/2010,"to be honest i don't see a big deal about this. yes, plexes will become slightly more expencive because people will buy plexes with isk to get remaps. that's about it. might not be a good thing, bu does not look like a disaster to me. that being said, i remain neutral, and will not show my support to either proposal or counterproposal."
11/9/2010,something i saw in an earlier thread made me want to make this suggestion here as a standalone. the sin as it stands now doesn't seem to play to the strengths of the dominix class it's built upon. a t2 dominix should have its attributes geared more towards drone use. what i'd like to see is the removal of all turrets slots and bonuses and have them replaced by a bonus that grants a 99% reduction in cpu and capacitor to drone control unit. this would require the sin to need 5 of its 7 high slots to fit drone control units and make the sin a true drone boat which plays to it's strengths better as a mini carrier of sorts. thoughts?
11/9/2010,i think you misunderstand the purpose of the black ops battleships.
11/9/2010,seeing as it's main purpose is that of a bridge maker and it's base stats are worse the the tech 1 dominix...i would say it's a covert infiltration ship and not a frontline warship at all.and therefor shouldn't fight like one.
11/9/2010,"where do u get the idea from it is a bridge maker? do u know why it is deffinaly not a bridge maker? it is really bad in making bridges. the current size of the fuelbay makes it impossible. they have no real role atm. i see way too many trolls around in the assembly hall last few feeks so let me start of and let me be a good example:changes needed: sin:-sin needs 2000+ base power more, a lol 8800 (ccp did u forgot a 1 in front of the 8800? redeemer has 17000 base power) base power on a semi hybrid? boat is fail-remove all turret slots and replace 5 % hybrid damage bonus for a 25m3 drone bandwidth usage bonus per gallente bs level and increase max drone usage from 5 to 10 (max dps 950 with ogre's).-change agility bonus to a 7,5% bonus in max velocity of drone flight time -give sin the special bonus of scooping drones from 7,500 meters and deploying drones at 5,000 meter (cloak).-maybe a 100-200m3 bigger cargohold to fit cap boosters (sin is horrible cap unstable)changes in general:-range increase from max 4,5ly to 6,5ly-range formula should get an exception that the black op can always jump 1 system jump. some systems with + 4,5ly (10ly-20ly, a to b with +4,5ly range need to be done manually in the current state)-standard fuel bay increase from 1000m3 to 3000m3-a bonus should be given to the fuel bay amount when a black op jump portal is fitted, it will add a additional x amount of m3 of fuel bay per black op level, example adds 3000m3 to fuel bay per black op level. -the black op jump portal should give a 10% reduction in fuel usage of that module per black op level. currently a recon that bridges uses 1500-1600 fuel while only 6666 fits in the fuel bayif u look realistic to all the black ops, u can assign certain roles to a black op based on its capabilities and the capabilities of its racial weapon capabilities. the redeemer & phanter gives insta dps on a target form a safe distance 30-50 km when used right (arazu (warp disr + remote sensor dampner) cyno ftw). the widow is a support ship with its jamms. just like the armageddon and typhoon is dps, scorpian is support. the dominix is a utility boat. if u look at the gallente weapon systems u see rails, blasters or drones. the dominix is a drone boat. its primary damage comes from drones. the t2 version should also use drones. there is only a problem, drones are not suitable for this kind of stuff, they take time to travel to the target (ogre's ii are slow). this makes it a fail black op. it would be perfect to make the sin an anti support boat with 10 drones with max skills & a good amount of high and mid slots for supporting its role. that role can be damage (remember still slow drones so it needs a drone velocity bonus) or anti support with its drones. it is easy to kill drones so i dont see an omgwtf anti support pwn machine.try to fit a sin in its current state with blasters or railguns. u will see that it is impossible to even come close to match the other black op's survival ability (ehp, buffer tank (2 x 1600 plates) and dps. the only way to get it all fit is by fitting 2 t2 ancillary current routers & by that the other black op's get an advantage since they don't have to fit fitting riggs. u could say ""why dont use sentry drones"". sentry drones are fail, the dronebay is too small for multiple encountes & drones loss. u cant restock drones from a hauler (try docking in hostile space). the optial and fall off (tracking upgrades are really bad a lol 70 km optimal with 20km falloff (lol?)) makes it a big disadvantage vs the primairy wepons from all the other black opstyphoon base power grid: 12500phanter base power grid: 12750armaggedon base power grid: 16500redeemer base power grid: 17000dominix base power grid: 9900sin base power grid: 8800scorpion base power grid: 9000widow base power grid: 8800why got a semi hybrid boat 1100 power less than its t1 counterpart while the other black op got 250 -500 more while the sin is an armour & hybrid boat that needs allot of power alone for armour plates & hybrid guns (shield boat's (widow) doesnt need power as much as armout boat's). fitting a large armour repair system is not a option because it will take 2300 power (1/4th) to get a 350 dps tank with resist's that are lower than a cruiser. the capacitor isn't exactly big ether.currently in short:sin = failsin drone speed = failsin with sentry = failsin with rails = triple failsin with blasters = little bit less faili support itoriginal black op topic to discuss stuff in"

11/9/2010,there is no need to change the cap usage bonus on the prophecy or any other amarr ship. lasers are intended to require a cap usage bonus. the ship bonuses do not need fixing. the base attributes of lasers need fixing.
11/9/2010,i disagree. i think that lasers are very well balanced at the minute. its just the prophecy has nothing really going for it other than epic ehp.
11/9/2010,"i would agree if it were not for the significance of armor tanking in the meta-game surrounding pvp. if you expect to face shield tanked opponents with comparable frequency to armor tanked, then they are well balanced. however, strong shield tanks occupy slots needed for tackling, making it unpopular in pvp. for amarr ships that do not have a bonus to laser damage, projectiles are a preferable alternative when fitting for pvp with the expected bias towards armor tanking: especially, since that allows for enhanced ehp when fitting autocannons. if fitting weapons other than lasers is a sensible option on a ship that has a bonus for lasers, then lasers are not properly balanced.if there is no issue with the meta-game significance of armor tanking, then there is no issue with the amarr ship bonuses as they have an effective damage bonus built into the base attributes of the lasers. that includes the prophecy.base dps of heavy beam lasers is 16%/25% higher than railguns/artillery, with an added tracking bonus for beam lasers over the other two. base dps of heavy pulse lasers is 11% higher than autocannons. base dps of heavy neutron blasters is 17% higher than heavy pulse lasers but only within a very short range, blaster dps drops off very quickly as range increases, but remains modest out to disruptor range. if you factor in armour resistances the damage advantage of lasers is a distant memory. hybrids are balanced to provide comparible damage to both shields and armor. projectiles are able to change ammo type to deal with both shields and armor. lasers are great for breaking shield tanks, but are heavily gimped when it comes to breaking armor tanks.without factoring in the bias towards armor tanking, lasers are well balanced with their advantage established in mid-range engagements. factor in the bias towards armor tanking and web/disruptor range engagements common to pvp, and lasers have a noticeable disadvantage. that is a systematic weakness of lasers. if that weakness is an issue, then it needs to be fixed for all lasers. medium range brick is the role that the prophecy is made to fill. if that role is broken, what role should the prophecy fill?"
11/9/2010,"current warp tunnel is fine, but maybe there also should be some animation on ship? change color of an engine flare, or some field around a ship.so for other players, warp of ship will not be just ""fly out of a grid in second"". there is also may be some use of knowing that ship is initiated a warp..."

11/9/2010,have you even checked out the new pi gui on sisi at all? a good proportion of the problems that you've detailed are being fixed or have been fixed already. check pi features in the upcoming new major winter patch cause this whole thread is not really applicable for csm approval and the assembley hall.edit... go here and read.. took me the best part of 5 mins to find.winter patch incursion pi improvementsif you try pi in sisi u'll also find that idle extractors create alerts in your science and industry window on planets tab. and extractors have been totally revamped so that they are more command and control facilities in charge of up to 10 traditional extractors.
11/9/2010,"not supported.i am not a suicide ganker, but i don't see an issue with it. if you are flying around in something that a dozen people are willing to *suicide* themselves over, even after considering loosing their sec status and their ships (keep in mind insurance has been nerfed so they loose more now), then you kindof deserve it.even if they did nerf suicide ganking, this method would not work. all a suicide ganker would have to do is move all their isk to an alt, and carry a negative balance."
11/9/2010,"you know, i did pose a possible solution to the alt thing...."
11/9/2010,"i'm with de'veldrin on this one. part of what makes eve so great to me is the fact that the game isn't there to make sure you never get hurt too bad or lose things at any point. in high security systems, there is a definite penalty for attacking a ship without provocation, and concord is able to respond reasonably quickly to attacks. i don't believe it to be necessary, however, to prevent players dedicated enough to taking out a high value target via ganking from doing so. yes, losing ships and billions worth of modules isn't fun, but it's always a possibility when you undock. players don't normally call it an exploit when their titan or supercarrier gets taken out because they did something dumb that resulted in them being tackled outside of pos shields alone, and it shouldn't be considered an exploit for a group of players to take down a freighter/expensively fitted marauder/faction ship in the time it takes concord to respond to their attempt to do so.if ccp wanted concord to always show up instantly every time to prevent ships from getting destroyed by gankers, concord would always show up immediately and have the overwhelming firepower to destroy any ship in one volley. this is not the case, though. concord takes time to respond to criminal acts and smart players make use of this game feature to facilitate ganking. if you don't like it, no one is making you undock in a ship carrying/fitted with billions in cargo/mods, and no one is making you play this game where a lot of what would be considered griefing in other games is just considered a normal event."
11/9/2010,"yeah your right, it would work to make the fine cross over to your other characters because no-one in eve has multiple accounts.."
11/9/2010,"my solution included basically putting the alt in debt. what i meant is that, if the player wanted to use this character for other activities again, the debt would have to be paid (either by doing missions or something for concord, or paying for it with a main).being rude is not very constructive, by the way"
11/9/2010,"i think the phrase ""working as intended"" comes to mind. the devs have repeatedly stated that suicide ganking is a valid tactic and is even encouraged in some cases. hulkageddon has the ccp's seal of approval on it. pretty sure it's their favorite in game event."
11/9/2010,"i've been the victim of a few suicide ganks, and lost billions of isk worth of goods and blueprints. i've never suicide ganked anybody in my life. that being said, i am against any nerfs to suicide ganking over the ones that they have already applied.suicide ganking is essential for the economy to continue, as ships and equipment (asides from possibly ammo) have no 'shelf life'. they're in the game until they're destroyed.if suicide ganks didn't exist, approximately 50-70% of the playerbase who never venture into low/null sec would quickly deflate the economy, as goods wouldn't be lost and need to be replaced.eve is built around risk vs reward, and the rewards of trade far outweigh the risks for those of a financial bent. suicide ganking is part of the risks, and deserves to stay there if only for that reason.also, suicide ganking separates the wheat from the chaff. when you're ganked (as i've been a few times in the past), you either complain and quit the game, or you learn your lesson and become a better player.it's like ccp once said - ""eve isn't built to resemble a cold, dark, heartless universe - it's built to be a cold, dark, heartless universe."" it'll help if you stop comparing eve to star trek and start looking at it more like firefly.not supported."
11/9/2010,"really? according to battle clinic you've only lost around 280 million in the 2 ships that were destroyed and both were in low sec space which doesn't qualify them for suicide gank status.perhaps they were on another toon? if not, i really hate it when people try to pretend like they were a part of something in order to make their opinion worth more than it is."
11/9/2010,"the one in decon hurt as if it was a suicide gank, but technically it was not. i took the wrong jump accidentally and lost my navy vexor when i was hauling it to another station.my main loss was the suicide gank in uedama under my alt, krazeek. i lost over 10b isk of goods, but thankfully only one y-s8 ab dropped from the whole ordeal, so it was a loss for the actor too.regardless, i have been through the fires, and they can either burn you up or refine you. that is the point i was trying to make."

11/9/2010,"llando,he was a cool guy wasn't he? well... except for having a welsh name."
11/9/2010,"if you don't understand the pedigree of the question ""have you stopped beating your wife?"", despite me just explaining it, i'm not sure how else to make it clear. begging the question: ""we just can't be sure if he has stopped beating his wife or not""loaded question: ""so, have you stopped beaten your wife yet?""begging the question: ""we can't be sure if they're totally unaware of numbers of if they're involved in a conspiracy to crash nodes, as those are the only two possibilities."" loaded question: ""so, are you just unaware of how many numbers in your fleets or is your goal to destabilize the server, as those are the only two possibilities?""and it doesn't matter which coalition you'd like to make this about, feel free to discuss any but my previous demand holds true it would be different if you had at least some kind of evidence, like credible reports of coalition (any coalition, at all) forces entering systems with freighters and dropping hundreds of shuttles on grid, or killmails showing that every battleship that's downed has a cargo hold filled with a sea of copied bookmarks, or whatever. that, at least, would be prima facie evidence of behavior going on that has absolutely no probable use other than to create lag. instead, all you can point to is various groups raising the forces that they believe they'll need (or as many as they can, at least) in order to defend a system/objective and others raising as many as they can/they think they'll need to score overwhelming victory. you're back to arguing a plot on the part of the sun to burn you and a conspiracy of diner-havers to produce ****. i've pointed all this out several times, but you keep returning to the ""so have you stopped beating your wife?"" school of argument.i'd ask again if you have any proof, at all, that anybody is involved in deliberately crashing nodes rather than simply attacking a target with as many people as want to/as they can get, but something tells me that such evidence will never be forthcoming. am i wrong on that point?"
11/9/2010,"the council of stellar management presents a public roundtablewhendate: november 21st, 19:00 to 21:00 eve timelocation: ingame chat channels 'csm_roundtable_answers' and 'csm_roundtable_questions'whatthe council of stellar management is organising a public roundtable where you, the players, can ask us difficult questions about what we've been doing and how we've been doing it. ccp will be represented by ccp xhagen, the csm project manager, to field any questions you may have about the relationship between ccp and the csm.as the roundtable takes place aproximately three weeks before our december summit with ccp, this will also help us determine if there are issues we need to discuss with ccp that have escaped our radar and provide some measure of how effective we've been in representing the playerbase.the following topics are under consideration for the summit agenda. agenda items get one hour (or more) of in-depth discussion with the relevant developers.* post dominion 0.0 * user interface * csm processes, tools, and evolution * economics/eve economy (double session?)* incarna game play * game balance requested by players * csm activities at fanfest 2011 * microtransactions * quality assurance at ccpnote that this event is not intended to pitch your own csm proposals or ask us ""why the nighthawk doesn't get a bit more powergrid""."
11/9/2010,i am so there!
11/9/2010,"tl;dr: mild rantjust because there has been no ""progress"" doesn't mean that things like ""blobs"" and other ""big issue"" topics have not been addressed by csm. lack of visible progress is not due to willfully ignoring these things. sometimes it simply makes the most sense to spend the limited time we can devote to this volunteer job on other issues. being on the csm consumes a lot of time. consider how much time a delegate might spend on average each month to:-- participate in eight fellow delegates' discussions on matters of interest to them/their constituents or general game/ccp issues-- complete tasks the csm related to dev planning meetings, summits, focus groups, and other activities that require preparation and have dependencies associated with them-- complete tasks associated with communicating with players (such as writing csm blogs, minutes, and forum posts)-- discuss csm process and admin stuff (boring but necessary) amongst ourselves and with ccp-- discuss topics raised by ccp, which often are ""time critical"" and thus get priority-- research proposals from assembly hall that delegates plan to raise for a vote in our bi-weekly meetings-- respond to constant emails, im's, forums posts, and forum pms from players with ideas, suggestions, rants, questions, etc.-- interact with your constituents to gather opinions, ask questions, and do research to inform the choices you make as a delegate. ...then consider how much time any of us have left after work, family, school, and life to devote to the csm. it usually adds up to the fact that there are a lot more things wanting delegate time than there is time for delegates to spend on them. besides time limitations and overshadowing priorities, another reason that some campaign promises may not get addressed proactively is because the glimpse we get of what's in the plans for ccp's dev resources over the next few dev cycles may make it clear that ccp cannot address a given issue at this time--especially something as undefinable as ""the blob problem"" which would take a lot of time and thought to address in any meaningful way--if it even ever could be. (admittedly, our influence on the big picture plans for eve is like ****ing into the wind so far. maybe the groundwork laid so far will permit future csms more success in that endeavor.)want your delegate to focus more on campaign promises? ask how you can support their efforts related to those promises. offer to step up and do research, be a voice, lead discussion, write arguments, and draft proposals. that is more likely to motivate delegates to focus on your pet issues than griping in forums. i can hear some of you now. ""but you get free trips to iceland! why should we do any work? we get nothing!"" to that i say, this is a community, right? what do communities do when they want to accomplish something? they work on their objectives together. many hands make work light, as the old saying goes. also, the trips to iceland aren't free when you factor in the value of an active delegate's time and the fact that in some cases (like mine) a week's pay is forfeited or (in the case of others) vacation time is used for csm work instead of spending it with friends or family doing something fun. compared to camping, fishing, sightseeing, etc., iceland trips are work and a lot of it (even if you do manage to squeeze in some partying or touristy stuff on extra days--for which you get to pay the hotel bill).i suggest everyone who is dissatisfied with the csm run for a seat in the next election. should you get elected and participate actively and responsibly, i'm willing to bet you'll come out the other side with a completely different perspective on just exactly how difficult it is to fulfill every campaign promise. a balanced assessment of how much good was done for the game in any given csm term might be a more useful metric.okay, rant over. damn, that felt pretty good."
11/9/2010,"good grief, was that rant absolutely necessaryeasiest option is dont make promises you cant keep, and also you say if we dont like it we can run for the job, i say if you dont like it dont do it rather than rant why dont you lot keep making some update posts in a short bullet point summary format, that way we can actually read a small piece of info pertinent to the issues we are interested in rather than pages of minutes only a minority will actually read,my attention span to such things are minimal anyway, the major issues will always be asked about but always seem to be lost in pages of verbal spew ie faction warfare seems to have ground to a halt, sov is talked about but no action and pi got slipped in how was that possible without csm interaction to either prevent it or at least appeal against it?you either represent us or you will continue being a usp for ccp to aid in pr ect"
11/9/2010,"the point i was trying to make is, it is impossible to know when campaigning in good faith on some issues whether circumstances will make it possible to keep those promises. certainly anyone who campaigned on promises like ""i will fix x, y, and z"" is skating on dangerous ice since it is improbable they will be able to accomplish that. ""my interest areas are x, y, and z; i will support and push for discussion on topics related to those things."" as used by myself and others is a much better approach.as for ""bullet point"" updates, that's a reasonable suggestion. i'll start doing this mid-month for the remainder of the csm5 term, here in jita park."
11/9/2010,well replied
11/9/2010,"thank u ruleofthebone for getting attention to this subject. i'm running that proposal for 13 months now and u seems to get more attention for it on this way in 3 months than i managed to get in 13 months. alot of people are just trolling without having experience with this ship. i have edit my first post of the proposal with stuff that really need to be fixed. the sin really needs more power grid, the rest of the racial changes are optional but i do want to remind ccp that black ops are t2 battleships and they should get some advanced racial stuff. in example more drones on sin, more laser dps on redeemer and more falloff on phanter. the current drone bandwith for redeemer and panther is like having missiles slots on the lachesis (hybrid/drone race with missile's as primary damage dealing wtf?) the stuff that really need to be tweeked is the general black op stuff:let me hook onto your reply teadaze; -any ship can cyno onto normal cyno's but covert cyno's need cyno l5, a 25day skill, a 300 mil skill in plex terms. -there is no other ship in game with a jumpbridge that need to risk itself by traveling trough normal gates to be able to use its jumpbrige/cyno; do u know regional gates? the ones that have +60au warps and the gates are +4,5 lightyears away from each other. it is risky to make those jumps unscouted in a 1b isk slow battleship.-do u know how much fuel a recon uses to bridge the full 4,5 ly? compare that to the fuel bay and the amount the black op itself uses. someone must have been sleeping at ccp when they looked at the fuel bay increase, no common sence used at all. (wts common sence on eve subjects, 500mil per hour ccp and u got yourselve a new wizkid advizor that can solve most probelms by just using common sence & experiance, do u actulay play/pvp in eve?)i really hope ccp does something with them in the winter patch. i have friend working for pc gamer who wanted to do this article about the csm incompetence for over 2 months now. he wants to use this subject (among others) as example how the csm - ccp relation is since it can be categorized to a certain level of deception towards players and non players. i might be able to stall him until winter patch, not sure tough."
11/9/2010,"let me be utterly clear - i'm not saying that black ops ships shouldn't be looked at again, i'm simply stating that they are usable as they are and have had one (minor) buff already. i personally don't believe they should be able to throw multiple t3 and recon ships around the place without support but i know that is what some people want to do.the cost of a covert cyno is irrelavant. how many isk worth of training time does it cost to get a titan pilot and titan which is the only other ship in the game that can bridge other ships? 1 month training is trivial even compared to the black ops ship itself. and that cyno 5 char allows you to bridge into a cyno jammed system which is a unique feature that people keep trying to ignore. whilst on the subject of cost, a black ops bs is now under 500 mil including the portal gen, they are no longer 1+ billion ships.i am certain (99% sure) that there will be no changes to black ops in the winter expansion. again csm would rather they worked on this than some of the stuff ccp actually planned but i digress i also fail to see how this shows csm incompetence. there are 100+ csm issues that ccp haven't implemented yet and a number that will be released soon. if anything in the last 6 months csm have had more effect than the previous sessions combined. attaching success or failure criteria of the whole csm process to one single issue out of 150 in total is pretty silly. there are other stakeholder departments within ccp who have requested features not yet implemented, have they failed too? but as you've made the threat - get your friend at pc gamer to contact josh augustine from pc gamer usa (who was present at the csm4 summit and wrote a nice article about the process). josh has my email if he wants to discuss this further. accusing csm or ccp of deception is a fairly serious charge and i don't think it stands up to scrutiny."
11/9/2010,this thread is not to argue that the dominion sov system sucks for attacking/defending/paying for whatever. this is purely to ask when we can expect to maybe possibly see a system support the kind of numbers we were told they would almost a year ago when dominion launched?a system can possibly support 10 people if a group runs high tier anomalies in a group for some reason and people rat without breaking chains in a system with good true sec. this is less than a fifth of what ccp promised a 0.0 system would be able to support and the current state of 0.0 is exactly what most of us were worried about. that ccp would give us the dominion sov system and then quickly forget about it in exchange for something shiny and new.which is exactly what happened. whats the deal ccp?
11/9/2010,space barbie has priority.
11/9/2010,do want one of these.
11/9/2010,we discussed this with soundwave during one of the summits (i think it might have been csm4). the outcome of the discussion was that it would be good for the system upgrades to increase the number of higher level anomalies and reduce the number of lower ones (because once sanctums and havens are available pretty much nobody runs the low level stuff. those people who can't fly battleships can also make more isk salvaging other peoples' anoms than running the low level ones).we've heard nothing since so i'll add chasing it to the list for the december summit.
11/9/2010,not to mention corporation and alliance tool overhaul
11/9/2010,"i have read through the proposal linked here. are these proposal refined well enough that ccp can make a ""story"" out of them or do they need more discussion?"
11/9/2010,we have to make the case for why ccp should make changes to the item in question and once that has been agreed ccp will take the ideas in the proposal into consideration. there is no guarantee that they will implement it as described.
11/10/2010,"modular systems sound good. imagine the pos shield being a module that you attach to a pos but it only has enough power to support the shield and no other systems. remote rep turrets added to a pos, drone spewing systems [that are filled with whatever drones you desire to control] that a pos turret user can control, actually add the gun turrets to the pos tower itself instead of drifting outside but can still be targetted and destroyed [like outpost sub-systems], reduced sig radius transmitter etc."
11/10/2010,imo -- big change to help them out: allow black ops use in highsec. all the ship types can go there and covert cyno's bypass blocks so...that'd make a very interesting change to some highsec war situations.
11/10/2010,"my sin is used as logistic ship - if it is used at all. shield tank, cargo rigs, cargo expander in low slots and i have enough fuel to bridge small covert op gangs around. but the bridge range is much to low for this kind of black op action. you can not have more then 2 or 3 target systems in range and even with so many cargo mods fitted you have not enough fuel to move your fleet around. cloaky t2 hauler dont have much more cargo space.more bridge range or _much_! larger fuel bay would help for this kind of black op use.i never used my black op in combat, because a 40 mio isk dominix > sin even if the sin would cost only 100 mio isk i would still prefer a dominix for combat.if you want black ops in combat you should give them a much better tank."
11/10/2010,nay!
11/10/2010,"you need to read the thread more carefully.the presence or lack there of, of children, a safety feature, parental control, or other ilk filtration method is not in any way part of this thread discussion and should have no effect on your vote to support or not support this thread."
11/10/2010,"yes and they had futa.if you read the back story for asari as the blue aliens are called you will find that they reproduce by ""parthenogenesis"" and have the reproductive organs of both genders in their resting state. as well as the ability to metamorphism their genitalia to meet the gender needs of the partner. look at how successful mass effect is! they did not have explicit scenes or imagery of the genitals for any actors in the game. however the body mesh for the asari did have a phallus as well as a vaginal opening, albeit a strange ribbed one. i know this because i extracted it from the game myself for erhem... private use.mass effect did not need to show you it because you already knew it was there and incarna can be the same way. i am pleading with the community to find a reason to justify your vote and then act on it by marking support of this thread."

11/10/2010,this could be combined with the blasters post as hybrids as a whole need a boost. but rails most of all.
11/10/2010,"if hybrids are any good at all, why do all my pvp gallente fits use projectiles?"
11/10/2010,let me guess :)- projectiles do not consume cap- projectiles have ridiculous pg requirements- considering selectable damage type projectiles have almost the same dps as hybrids- having all these advantages projectiles simply have longer range

11/10/2010,"i'll let my posting alt give support to this. i currently have assets trapped in 0.0 outposts/stations, losing them due to destruction doesn't seem too different. i've just a couple of things i'd like to add:i don't like the idea of making it a special ship to wreck outposts. it should be possible using conventional means. if this means that a titan blob kills it quicker so be it. this is a sandbox, stop putting artificial limits on things.if its a wreck make it function like a wreck. only a portion of assets should survive wrecking. i don't like the idea of the wrecker not being able to loot the station wreck. it seems a bit clunky to allow people to access their own hangers from external to the wreck as well. what is stopping other people from doing that?i understand that it is a ui challenge but it would be good to have various containers available within the station wreck corresponding to different corp and personal hangers. perhaps use of the archeology skill to open up the hangers, with the hacking skill being used to try and gain access to password protected containers stored within them. you could maybe give a bonus to people trying to recover their own materials from the station given that they'd know where to look.i'd also destroy all clones in the station, probably ships too. if you are docked you're podded and appear either at your clone location, or the nearest empire npc station, if your clone was at the station."
11/10/2010,not necessarily this exactly; but something like it or what teadaze has suggested.
11/10/2010,"1. size of projectiles got reduced to make it possible to carry different ammos and considering the higher ammo use. this change was done in dominion. ammo size reduction on hybrid ammo is not needed, since you only need 2 ammo types in general and it is only a issue for longer sniping sessions(aka pos shooting).2. reloading time of 10s is fine. changing ammo mid fight should present some drawbacks. 3. tracking needs a buff, however the real problem is the web strength. if you want to fix it all with tracking you will create a 25km death zone around any blaster bs instead of just a 10km(like it was before qr).this is actually the most important point, what made most blaster ships not perform proper in her niche role to a point where it makes no sense to use them.4. null ammo is designed to keep blasters short range, it is not like barrage or scorch. 5. a useless rating, since it is not based on how this parameters scale ingame but only on raw stats. the main problem isn't being far less effective at medium ranges, the problem is about being not better off at point blank.6. all t2 short range ammos suck.problem of the brutix is not cap in a armor tanked setup, it is the miserable range of electrons and the low speed. then again the armor tank bonus is pointless on it anyway, since the myrm does this far better and it totally gimps the only strong point of the brutix."
11/10/2010,"well, there is already a shield damage bleed effect that is mitigated by tactical shield manipulation. i'm thinking perhaps the slower-cycling, longer range siege ammunition you're proposing would also have a small shield bleed through (say... 5%... something quite low but enough to spook the targets) whereas the mid range one would not, and the high damage short range charges would again have a shield bleed through but less (3%) - or you could even go one step further and make the possibility of a shield bleed completely random.this certainly wouldn't be enough to kill a shield tanking ship by any means, but it would provide another niche for hybrid snipers being able to 'soften up' targets more effectively at range."
11/10/2010,"good proposal.one issue that is not touched in the proposal is damage type selection - projectiles have a good selection of damage types while lasers have none. if hybrids were meant to be hybrids, they should have at least a choice between more thermal and more kinetic damage, or another set of damage types (e.g. kin - exp)"
11/10/2010,"good proposal. i support the idea.on the idea of damaging both shields and armor at the same time, may be a little much to ask for. but...perhaps there is a random chance that the hybrid charge will penetrate the shield, although not cause damage to it, and damaging the armor. this effect could have similar chances of damage as how optimal and falloff work. with in optimal you have say a 50% chance of penetrating the shield and damaging armor, and then hull when armor is down. past optimal the chance decreases similar to the current mechanics of falloff."
11/10/2010,"so, long range ammo is designed to keep range short while incurring heavy penalties on everything except rangeand other races are designed to have long range ammo while galente/caldari are designed to be inferiorif you are right and it's by design then the design is bad and unfair and needs fixing, maybe adding 25% dmg bonus in adition to the current 25% range bonus to null amo would be fine then"
11/10/2010,"this idea i never understood. with missiles moreso than guns, but a flat 10 second reload on every weapon system seems kind of ill thought out. 10 seconds for a frigate to reload is considerably different than a battleship taking that time to reload."

11/10/2010,"level 4s arent really an isk faucet to me. yes, there are ways to easily get 20 million an hour, but even then normal players in their ""carebear mobiles"" mostly get around 5-10 million an hour, give or take. with the decline of salvage prices, i have found its better to just blitz level ivs for bounties and agent rewards than to salvage or collect loot. even so, i rather just do wormhole stuff (more isk/hr). the rewards for level ivs are lower than they were a year ago.. even with a high quality agent. i understand the fact that pvpers want more of an opportunity to destroy carebears, but there is a fine line between ""annoying but fair"" pvp and ""griefing"". with the corp on corp prices are, its pretty much griefing.nevertheless, i agree with the idea of the fine line with pve and pvp, but it shouldn't be pennies on the dollar to be an a-hat. high sec pvp is fine, i never had an issue with that. i just have a problem with the cheapness is all."

11/10/2010,"an isk faucet = wealth brought into the game that previously didn't exist.so npc bounties, mission payouts, salvage and npc loot, and minerals are all isk faucets into the game. isk made from trading, industry, or pvp is not an isk faucet. level 4 missions are most certainly a major isk faucet in eve, there's simply no disputing that.i completely disagree about your griefing comment. there isn't a fine line between pvp and real griefing, because to me if it's done within the legitimate mechanics of the game, ie not cheating or taken outside the context of the game it is in no way griefing. the problem is some players consider any negative pvp encounter that they didn't expressly choose to be a part of as griefing. it simply isn't griefing, not those of us that have embraced sandbox pvp mmorpgs.while i don't agree with his last comment, ""the pitboss"" has every right to be responding in your thread. he's the leader of one of the larger highsec wardecing alliances. your idea is a direct attack on the playstyle and interests of a lot of players he represents. you might say well he wasn't very constructive, but at first he pointed out that you didn't seem to have a grasp of all the mechanics of wardecs to begin with, you also didn't seem to understand what i meant by isk faucet. without understanding of what you meddling with your at best wasting peoples time with your proposal, even those that might agree with your general sentiment.people flame on forums like this because really there isn't much point doing anything else. i might as well have told you ""your idea is crap and **** off!"" and it would have about the same effect of me writing these long winded posts trying to engage in real dialogue. because it doesn't matter what we say, the same arguments and calls for change keep cycling around, there is in many cases no compromise, and no point in dialogue because we simply want radically different things out of a game like eve. even if i could persuade you to think differently it wouldn't be more than 24hours before another several people that simply don't get sandbox mmos post a ""nerf wardecs"", ""nerf cloaking"", or ""nerf ninja slavagers"" or some other stuff.however, here's the twist, i don't blame you or the flock of idiots that post nerf afk cloaking and other such posts. i blame ccp. like a lot of developers they pretend their game caters to a wide audience when in reality it does not, and cannot span the the spectrum of players they entice to play and pay a subscription. if anything, eve is leaning your way so maybe you should rejoice that eq in space is not long in fully coming to fruition. i just wish ccp and others would be bold and honest about who their game is for... if it's not for pirates, empire pvpers like pitboss, players like suddenly ninjas, pvpers that raid nullsec sov holders looking for ratters to kill, then just say. i for one will just move on and be done with it.. no more xorv essays on eve-o"
11/10/2010,"xorv, i would say there is plenty of your type of eve left to play. should level 4 missions be removed from high sec? not at all. they're an important part of learning combat in eve. hell, as a player barely over 4 months, i'm just starting to do level 4 missions. am i ready to competently fight other players in eve? not by my judgment. eve is not just a big game, its a huge game with nuances and skills i haven't even begun to understand yet. i'm earning money and learning things but i've only just scratched the surface. eventually, i'll make the transition to low sec when high sec no longer presents enough challenge or story but for now i'm just trying to wrap my head around it all. sometimes i think the eve vets forget what starting out new in eve is like. it is a big sandbox and its intimidating and imposing enough without the big kids coming over to kick sand in your face every few weeks just because they think its hilarious to watch you cry. i can only dream of what kind of place eve would be if everyone tried a little more cooperation and role playing in this game instead of just trying to see who can one up everyone else in being the most greedy back stabber in mmo history. if ccp is moving away from the pvp experience like you think they are, perhaps its because they think that too many players are pooping in their sandbox by perverting the experience they're trying to provide into something ugly."
11/10/2010,"the wardec system is definitely broken.it should cost way more for the wardec. it should be more less one sided than it is.currently, any 5 man corp can go around wardeccing anybody for no reason at all. this makes their target leagal to shoot. so then what happens?a) the target corp enjoys a little pvp every now and then and they engage in battle. if the goal of the war party is the rush of battle they are pleased.b) the target corp does not want to engage. they stay huddled in stations, and basically stop playing eve.does ccp really think this is good for business? do they really want war griefers running around and stifling the play of others?there are very few ways to avoid war. you can change corps. you can try to join an alliance so that the next time these griefers renew the wardec is costs 50million. but to create an alliance it costs 2.5bn isk you can lay low until the wardec is over. this results in players playing less. it discourages play, and from a business standpoint, i can't see that ccp benefits from this.the current system makes nothing but victims.change it so that actions by players give ""war rights"" instead of kill rights. when another player ninja slavages, suicides a transport, or can flips, this gives you the right to declare war."
11/10/2010,"well yes, when people think isk faucet is when money is generated from nothing. i know what you mean, but whether it being profitable or worthwhile is when it comes into question. when i think isk faucet in your context, i think money generated from nothing plus that it is worthwhile. this comes into question whether or not level ivs should be gimped and imo, they have lost their flavor and context... which is why i rat in wormhole space. of course, this is an opinion and is always open to discussion and flaming.see that is where i believe you are wrong. alot of people in high sec goto war simply to stat pads and to attack weaker corps simply ""for the lulz"" and to grief. of course, it makes logical sense to not wardec a corp who is more powerful than your own, but even so a good portion of those people who do not wish to fight, are newbs, or just really like to pvp in low sec are now forced to deal with a new problem. granted, this is the ever changing ebb and flow in eve, but wardecs were supposed to be towards a certain goal. to knock out newb corps, to stat pad, or just to be an overall a-hat are goals completely related to griefing. from all the corporations i have been in contact with and a few ex-corp mates i have that do wardecs in highsec ""for the lulz"", i have never heard one person say ""they are attacking us because they want to stop our market control"" or ""to take down our pos because they want to stop our ability to crap out ammo"" etc etc. its more of ""they wardecd us because one of our newbs was jet canning."" or ""they wardecd us because we blew up one of their ninja salvaging newblets."" reasons completely unrelated to the real ebb and flow of eve. instead of wardeccing because of economic control or military superiority, it is becoming just a way for someone to be an a-hat online to people weaker than them.and as a side note, don't give me the ""we do it to keep x prices up"" kind of excuse. that is a false security blanket that many corporations use to hide the fact they really just want to grief.towards pitboss, i understand that he feels threatened but he had zero constructive criticism. xorv, your posts are constructive and give insight to the pvp world. i respect that. i ""dig it"". and yes, i do believe wardecs should exist in high sec (omfg really?!?!). yes, wardecs should be in highsec! i will never say they should be taken away. i will never say they should cost a billion isk to wardec a new corporation. i do not wish to change the mechanics in any other way, except the price... primarily for wardecs between corporations. i can understand the fact that pittboss wants to prevent his wardecing prices from skyrocketing, but to be honest this attack is not really meant for him. if it costs him several billion a week to run all the wardecs he is apart of, then he has the right to protest these kinds of arguments. i wish there is a way so that we can increase the initial cost of the wardecs to a higher degree, but decrease the stacking costs. fighting is cheap. war is supposed to be expensive. if it really costs only a mere caracal to ask concord to ignore a war between corporations, i would love to see the cost for intelligence on what wars the wardeccie is currently in. would be nice to turn the tables against them.that is all i am trying to get at. fairness."
11/10/2010,"pittboss: i will not post my real id on here for the sheer fact that the second i do, my corporation will get wardecd. i may be a rambling idiot at times, but i am not stupid enough to cause my corporation to be a target for flaming. you may not want to waste your time on attacking my corporation, but i have a feeling a few others might and i rather protect the rest of my corporation from my opinions and concerns."
11/10/2010,terrible idea.
11/10/2010,"if changing the cost of wardec is a bad idea, then change how the surrender works.don't allow the warring corp to set the price (read ""ransom"") for the surrender.the only think keeping these idiots in wardec business is letting them think that it is a legitimate profession. it is an exploit, not a profession. make the surrender option at a set price, say 4 million. it costs you 2 million to declare, the corp surrenders 4 million, so the war corp gets 2 million. but, the war dec corp will not be able to reapply dec to that corp again.as it is, the 2 million it costs for wardec, usually results in a ransom of like 500 million. how is that fair? changing the surrender would legitimize the war profession, which i disagree with, but, at least it gives the victims an out. they wont have to stop playing eve for a week because of some griefer."
11/10/2010,"perhaps we are going at this the wrong way. i had an idea while i was out shopping today that may be a fair solution. leave the price of current war decs as they are, but make all war decs go through an actual petition. ccp should get a guy or guys who either part time or full time, receives ward dec petitions and decides if the petitioned reason is fair. you can't just tie ward decs to offenses like can flips or suicides since things like removal of competition are legitimate reasons for war. therefor, the system needs a moderator of sorts to keep things fair and legal. all you would need is simple proof of a transgression or need for a dec, send it in a petition and if approved, the war dec process would continue as normal, price and all. the surrender system would go through the same petition and the terms for surrender kept fair and made secure by the moderator. this system would keep costs as they are while eliminating the current rubber stamp that enables grief decs."
11/10/2010,"no after reading yours and other's responses i think my post was largely a waste of time, you think your having meaningful dialogue with me, but we aren't, in way it's like we're not even talking the same language. also, just to be clear i make no claim to be a representative of ""the pvp world"", especially in eve. sorry this is just so wrong i just had to respond. war may be expensive, declaring war is not. in reality the declaration part is dirt cheap."

11/10/2010,"once again people are comparing eve to rl and are still justifying actions because of stuff they do in rl, like i said, if you want things to be like rl you will have to change stuff to be like rl, not meet half way.in rl a person in the army / military gets paid to be in the army / military, in game this isnt the case, as well as blindly following leaders they also have to farm their own isk (alliance replacements arent that great).in rl this would never be the case, wasting your time, effort and your assets on other people for free, while moon goo material is used for titan production and rmt.i propose we introduce wages where alliances will be forced to pay members, this will mean when a player recruits they will have to decide if its worth the money they are spending.coming soon  new profession dentist, where you can check your members teeth and see if they are flossingjust like rl!11"

11/10/2010,why force the game mechanics in a sandbox.if the people want wages then advertise that your corp gives wages. idea acomplished and wages paid to those who want them.
11/10/2010,"no offense to you alara, but i swear if i hear someone use the word sandbox again in eve i'll kill a bunny. why do people keep keep bringing up the damned sandbox? we get it, eve is an interactive gaming environment but i'm not building sand castles, mistaking cat terds for lincoln logs or any other damned thing. for the love of all that's holy, leave that stupid marchitecture word the hell out of your posts.like i said alara, this isn't aimed at you personally, just at the people using this word in nearly every thread i venture into.that said, i'm not against wages, but i'd have to hear a more detailed proposal before i committed to supporting it."
11/10/2010,"i beg to differ. lordelfa. eve is indeed a so called 'sandbox' game. it is merely a tag to identify it from non-sandbox mmorpgs though. whilst wow, lotro, war, aoc, aion, and eve are all 'interactive gaming environments', only eve is the true sandbox in this list where content and world focus on player freedoms, control, influence and choice rather than story driven, lineair and often pve focussed gameplay with overly restrictive game mechanics in an overly restrictive gameworld. i'm not sure if you have played a great deal of other mmorpg's but if you would have played as many as i did you might actually start to appreciate the term 'sandbox'. just my 0.2 isk."
11/10/2010,"when ccp stops calling it a sandbox, so will we i expect. until then, we'll simply mock you for your emo-rage about the whole thing.also, on the subject of the op - i sense some hostility from you towards large alliances? anyway, while we're at it we may as well introduce crew wages and ship upkeep, as well as docking fees at npc stations (scotty's gotta eat, after all), jump fees (who's paying the upkeep and energy bills on all these stargates?), and property taxes based on ship market value (and you thought you were smart building all those super-carriers)."

11/10/2010,"sandboxes have walls and a finite amount of sand.i see no value in ccp forcing corps to ""pay"" their members. the concept shows ignorance - i suspect a deliberate ignorance, given the op's posting history - of how corps and alliances work. the members already derive a significant advantage from being in a well-run corp. if the op is, as he has hinted many many times, unhappy with how his current corp operates, the correct solution is to leave it and join one that plays the game the way he likes."
11/10/2010,"the problem is certain people / alliances / coalitions are obsessed with comparing eve to rl to the point where they think eve is reality, i just thought it would be good to have ccp add actual rl stuff like wages, food, hygiene into the game.at least that way people have an excuse to compare internet spaceships to rl"
11/10/2010,"not to derail here, but i have no issue with the sandbox style of game play, i wouldn't play eve if i did, i'm just sick of everyone using the word as if they've become marketing puppets spouting whatever tag word of the month ccp has tossed them. just pick a different word, i'm getting sand in my swimsuit from all this butt hugging.op, this is a game and after careful consideration, i can't support this kind of initiative as it adds too much rl to my fun time, sorry man.sandysandsandbox."

11/10/2010,well. in a manner of speaking this is already possible when dolling out dividends. if i remember right there is a way to pay out to the members through that without actually giving them shares. even if you don't several corps i have been that pay there members just do it. i will admit that they were smaller corps but still.... the thought is there of creating an easier mechinism for paying them when you want to.
11/10/2010,"what i'm wondering is if ecm burst takes covert ops ships out of cloak. if so...so i bring a scorpion out there with ecm burst loaded on it. when i get the warning, the scorp tosses out a burst. the burst reaches to ~52km on that hull, at 5 skills, and you pop the cloaked ship out of cloak.check the scorpion's bonus. that bonus works with ecm burst. so, at ""all 5's"" for ecm and caldari bs's, it's 18km optimal, 12km falloff: 2x falloff + optimal = 52km ""sphere"" type decloak range.to reach your 30km-40km range, it takes far less skills than i have outlined but that's the general idea.if not, no big deal but if so, i'm not the only one who knows about this particular ship bonus effect and how you could exploit it to push cloaked ships out of cloak near gates, in deep space, wherever..."
11/10/2010,"afk cloaking seems to bother macro ratters / miners only, any decent player can rat / mine without ever having to worry about cloakers"
11/10/2010,"our current options: prefer shorter, prefer safer, and prefer less secure are not specific enough. for example, if your security status is somewhere between -2.0 and -4.5, navigating through hisec can be a real pain. if you have low faction standings from running missions, it would be really nice if you could simply avoid those faction's hisec space altogether when trying to get from point a to point b. also, in some cases the prefer shorter option might plot you a route through some 0.0 space you'd rather not deal with. so i'd like to see the following changes/additions:more specific exclusions based on a system's security statusbasically something that gives you 11 options (0.0 through 1.0) to check, so if you cannot enter 1.0 space, you can uncheck the travel through 1.0 space option and the autopilot will generate a path that excludes 1.0 systems, where possible. similarity you can uncheck the travel through 0.0 space option if you want the autopilot to exclude 0.0 space in the route to your destination, where possible.exclusions in hisec space based on the owning factionyou have standings issues with gallente? no problem, just uncheck ""travel through gallente hisec"", and you won't have to worry about the gallente police chasing after you.of course all of these options would be under an ""advanced"" menu, so if you like the current 3 choice autopilot system, you don't have to change a thing."

11/10/2010,"i'm still pretty new to eve, been playing a few months now, but this idea keeps coming across my mind. i'm not sure how good of an idea it is, but i guess i'll find out. here goes...it shouldn't really need explanation, the basic idea is it works much like inertial stabilizers do in terms of effect but it would be an active module and would go in a medium slot much like an afterburner. obviously it would work better than inertial stabilizers alone.while i'm aware ships already have maneuvering thrusters (as that's the only way to turn) these would be an improvement (they could be named something else) to the existing ones. like afterburners they would come in different sizes and would need to be matched to the ships mass.they should have their own skill called maneuvering thrusters. it should have afterburner and/or evasive maneuvering as a prerequisite. it should increase the duration of the module in the same way that the afterburner skill does for afterburners.my backing for this idea is it makes logical sense, if you can upgrade the main engines to go faster there should be a way to upgrade the maneuvering thrusters to work better as well. there are passive and active modules for speed, but only passive for agility. in my opinion this makes sense.so... good? bad? so-so?"
11/10/2010,"well, maybe..."
11/10/2010,"it really is hard to say anything, since you don't actually propose anything with details. nothing on the module other than it being active. it could be good or bad depending on the details. so all i can say is, that this is definitely an idea."
11/10/2010,"well, that's because i'm not 100% sure on the game mechanics to try and suggest a specific number for agility. i'd say put it somewhere around 2 or 3 inertial stabilizers. like i said i'm still new, i'm just suggesting the concept (and leaving it up to ccp/the community for the specific amount and balancing).i think it should be grouped with mwds and afterburners in that you can only use 1 of the 3 at once. you shouldn't be able to turn really well and move quickly. maybe, maybe, use an afterburner and this, but that seems unbalanced to me. i'd only say allow that if there was a penalty of some sort (more cap usage to make it unrealistic without a bunch of cap rechargers?)"
11/10/2010,"you could actually make that the 5th subsystem for t3 cruisers. that way it can be somewhat ""pre-tested"" before you make a general module (or even rig?) for general use out of it. how it exactly would turn out (making direction changes without utilizing main thrusters or something) will have to be seen, but at least could give some nice additional graphics effect. doesn't even have to be tied to the current agility game mechanics actually. if you go beyond making it some sort of active inertia stabilizers, it could add a whole new element to flight mechanics. out of my head... imagine it enabling a carrier to do a 180<U+FFFD> turn without having any actual forward speed e.g.?"
11/10/2010,"so basically the afterburner equivalent of inertia stabilizers. huh... i like it.can't really see it being much practical use, but i like it anyway."
11/10/2010,"meh... its a nice idea but with the current combat system itd have little to no effect/advantage if its a rotation only, as your ship has to combat inertia before it can increase any traversial to affect hit types. but if they were used as a type of strafing module then new manual controls would have to be made.. or a multiplyer key in conjunction with arrow keys to manually control the ship.i could see hac's using this to boost their traversial quite considerably, and other ships using it to remove a targets traversial so guns hit better. that does induce a nice additional manual control element in combat situations ;)i like the name of ""situational thrust theory"" as the skillbook, and it should have a lot of prerequisits, evasive maneuvering 5 definitely as one afterburner 4 as another, nav 5 and acceleration control 4editing for support and id support it if it was manual control only so that hacs and ships using it to gain a traversial speed bonus would have to constantly manually control it. no autopilot control!"
11/10/2010,i do like the idea but it should auto off line itself when going into warp because other ways that module would let ships insta warp which is terribad
11/10/2010,i would like it as a module for some of the courier runs i occasionally get in the mood to do.
11/10/2010,bump
11/10/2010,"i think i'd rather have an isk-printing bpo as my useful xmas gift... and hell, yeah, some use for melted snowballs of old would be nice as well."
11/10/2010,"pretty simple. right now, 50% of the modules (ex rigs) and cargo drop when a ship is killed.this doesn't do much to encourage piracy and pvp because if you kill, say, a 100m isk ship with 30m of fittings and 10m of rigs, your expected revenue is 15m, plus possibly some salvage, which amounts to less than 20% of the total value of the kill. given that you probably need to risk at least as expensive a ship of your own to make the kill, and that it's relatively difficult to get a fight out of someone who doesn't want one, i think this system disincents pvp.it'd help if the drop rate were increased, make rigs drop sometimes, too, and possibly figure out a way to increase the salvage value from player ships. and, hey, maybe pend insurance is in cahoots with pirates (they're good for business, you know) and could make cash payments to players who blow up ships. these would all tilt the equilibrium towards more pewpew, which is the goal of this proposal."
11/10/2010,rofl!so how is having to pay out more than was spent on platinum insurance good business?its a good idea to get to know how the game functions before criticising it.plus if i blow up a bank and 50% of the money burns.. should i get the rest of them money and the money the building cost to make? the answer is no because the whole is not the sum of its parts in this case. the isk cost of a ship includes the work invested in it to change raw materials into functional and usable tools. if its non functional and will remain non functional then the isk invested in it has evaporated.btw.. not supported
11/10/2010,"this whole proposal reeks of fail. in particular, the parts about rigs dropping and the notion that an insurance company would pay to have someone make them lose money. in fact you should probably rethink this proposal entirely and forum-lurk for awhile."
11/10/2010,"there, fixed that for you.not approved."
11/10/2010,so i am a troll for having an opinion on the role of black ops.arn't you judgemental.why don't you take a look at what you are supporting. this would allow it to put out 942 dps with bouncer ii at up to and over 90 km with rigs. you really want to unbalance the races by supporting this idea. congrats you found a way to overpower gallente.call me a troll all you want i am not gonna support the op's suggestion of a 1000dps 100km sniper cloaky jump ship.
11/10/2010,"well hell alara, beef the rest up as well, i'm not trying to unbalance them. add a debuff to drone damage, disable it's ability to use heavy drones or even eliminate a few high slots to restrict the thing to only 7 or 8 heavies tops, i'm all for balancing. ;)"
11/10/2010,"i see you like the nonsequitor. heavens forfend ""overpowered coward fight""! that's game mechanics working exactly as intended, however. don't like it? kill their cyno ship faster."
11/10/2010,"i know where you want to go with it but i don't see what it will solve.outside 0.0 it will have no effect since 99% of cyno boats are neutral (usually in noob-corps), so you will still have to take aggression to quench the cyno .. in which case you can just shoot everything (ie. as it is now).in 0.0 it will only affect the very few places where nrds is employed, outside those a neutral is likely to get vaporized regardless so proposal is of little consequence.you have lived in blob-land for too long i fear. pray tell how you propose to kill a cyno-carrier, damnation, plate abaddon etc. when the hotdrop is made on your <20-30 man bc/bs gang in low-sec?counter suggestion:make jamming the cyno with a directed/targeted module increase fuel-cost (by a lot) for all jumps made to said cyno, orthe extend exit sphere of jumpees to 50-75km when jammed, instead of the current 2.5-5km (less attractive option in my mind).both still allow for ******s to fly around with their rulers to measure their epeen every five minutes, but also provide a little ""sand in your eyes"" o be used by a 'victim'."
11/10/2010,"oh my.... what game you palying ? you saw the new videos when 15-30 sc jumping to one single drakes in low sec?check it.kill faster cyno ship ? oh my....... open > jump 0.1 sec need to jump. use on a plated ship and you will kill the cynoship when everyone jumped in the system.ndrs ? does he have something to do with cyno module option ? nothing.cyno jammer module it's an opportunity against hotdrop or when the blobbers want to baiting, if you dont want to using dont use it."
11/10/2010,"you sure you don't want a death ray gun module instead with same fitting stats which can instapop any capital in game? there are capitals in game. fact. live with it or gtfo and live in high-sec. ""adapt or die"" all over again...not supported."
11/10/2010,"your fears are silly. if you can't quickly pop the cyno ship, then you engage knowing that in the time it takes to drop it, it can bring anything down on your head from a single carrier to a fleet of nyxes and titan bridged battleships. that's a deliberate part of the game and mechanics working exactly as intended. trying to 'fix' what's not broken because people object to others being able to throw superior force at them is, shall we say, less than compelling."
11/10/2010,that was nice back when there werent groups that had hundreds of moms and over 381 titans in the game.i do agree that the mod would need to be something bigger. if it was on a frigate like kessy coul could literally make the system impossible to jump into. and i could see the moms replacing a slot in their highs with them so they couldnt be counter hot dropped.
11/10/2010,"i think you misunderstood me. in low-sec you have no way of mitigating hotdrops, zero!in low-sec you can and will get dropped when in a lone cruiser!null-sec merely supersizes the whole thing with carriers acting as combat-cynos and sc's/titans being shat out rather than carrier/dreads .. end result is the same more or less.with status quo the only option in low-sec is run, blob or die. the blobbing is normally not possible as low-sec crews are normally rather small which leaves just running really (contrary to popular belief, dying is not an acceptable strategy).you cannot kill a cyno-ship in time for it to make a lick of difference, excepting of course that the capital pilots are drunk and asleep at the wheel, but basing balancing/proposals on people not actually playing the game is neither here nor there.or perhaps you have a bc/bs fit that is able to dish out the required 3-4k dps to kill the 1/4m ehp neutral cyno platform when not part of the 100+ man fleets you seem to consider the norm?hope that made it a bit clearer for you."
11/10/2010,"no, game mechanics don't suddenly get broken just because they're still operating as intended but there are larger groups. eve, simply, isn't fair. as such, eve not being fair is not and will not ever be a problem.again, you are wrong. you can pop the cyno ship. if you can't do that, then you can risk engaging whatever may be able to cyno through. and even then, you can fly aligned. and you are not talking about mitigating hotdrops, but eliminating them with the push of ""f1"". which is exactly as it should be. if someone brings superior force you can counter it, you can die, or you can run. if you normally fly with a small group, then the flipside of that is you may have to run from bigger groups. to say nothing of the fact that ""blob"" is a meaningless term, here used to simply mean ""counter force with equal or greater force"". if you need to do 3-4k dps, then looking to do it with 8 (or 12, or 20, or...) ships is a lot easier than with one. if you can't manage to fight back against greater odds, then tough luck for you. red in tooth and claw, and all that."
11/10/2010,nc advocating to bring bigger blobs to fight the blob. who would have thought.anyway... the module would mostlikely abused more than it would be useful. that said ... not supported.
11/10/2010,"yes, 8 (or, gasp, two whole squads worth of) people is a horrible ""blob"" and being able to alpha a cyno ship is something only a dastardly dastard could possibly think up. nice trolling though, i guess."
11/10/2010,80+ people is small gang roam right?i guess you are so active on the forums because nobody wants to fight you anymore?
11/10/2010,"trolling, then more trolling. nice! not very good trolling though, i'm afraid. of course, i said 8, not 80. the hint is what we in the business like to call a ""zero"".and if 80 people were required in order to counter an enemy force, then that's game mechanics. just like if you're flying an omen and you meet up with someone in a pulse apoc, you're probably going to end up dead. whining, while evidently satisfying for some, doesn't actually solve anything. if you go out on a roam, you're not guaranteed not to meet up with an enemy that can project more force/numbers than you can and which you cannot overcome. this is eve, you are not guaranteed fairness. you can adapt, you can lose, or you can chose another niche where you no longer have to compete with the same forces on the same dynamic. if you don't like it, go play wow. they have instanced dungeons there and the sides are kept even."
11/10/2010,"2 suggestions for name changes...1. old accounts not being paid / inactive accounts with names being used up should be free'ed up. if someoen is not paying for their timecard - why hold their toons name. put in a timeframe with a couple emails to them, and no renewal or activation on the toon, the toons name gets released to paying and playing customers.that toon gets renamed to some generic 1234sdafsd name by ccp and if ever that toon gets back online - they can change their name to a name that is not 'taken'.2.i wouldn't care if i had to pay 10$ or 20$ to change my name - but i would pay it. i hate my toon's name and would like to change it. to be forced to start a new toon and lose all that skill time is undesirable.i know its in the eula but i dont understand why ( if anyone has you bookmarked ) they dont get a notification email of a 'name change'.simple - and ccp gets some extra coin for the deed.that is the end of my rant."
11/10/2010,i completely agree.on both counts.
11/10/2010,i will vote for myself.
11/10/2010,"very open to abuse! ""ooo i need to change my toons name so i dont get suspected of being a corp and alliance thief... ill just not pay and play for a few months then come back, change name and apply to a new bunch of unsuspecting loosers!""this would meen any1 with a suspicious past could wipe the slate clean of their less than attractive past deeds."
11/10/2010,"geeshizzle,i see your argument...would you think it would be fair to allow 1 or 2 renames? that way it cannot be abused? i would just like/hope you put yourself in my shoes. i wanted to try the game - so i did. picked a name - played for a bit. liked the game - paid for it, and now 'stuck'."
11/10/2010,lol it star'd your name for some reason when i cut and pasted it.-the stars were not put there by me
11/10/2010,"lol i know.. its the forums auto swear filter thing.. which is wierd... 1 change would be enough, i know a few people who named themselves with corp tickers on their game names not realising they couldnt change it. so tbh if u started and realised u made a bit of an f up.. then 1 name change should suffice :)there should be an alias tag to the name like corp titles, but with former names."
11/10/2010,"i agree with recycling the names used on trial accounts that were never activated. (in fact, they should recycle the whole damned account - you're out what, 14 - 21 days of training and play time max? if they don't activate that trial within 6 months, can it).that's about as far as i am willing to go."
11/10/2010,+1 to 1st...

11/10/2010,"1 - i would only accept the recycling of characters and accounts for un-activated trials that are out by 6 months or more. if i leave for x months because of a problem or crisis in my life i don't wanna come back to my name being hamburgerstand1234 after paying for my account for 2+ years with my name.2 - as for number 2... i can agree with 1 name change and your old name tagged in there somewhere, but this gets suggested almost 2 or more times a week.oh!! there is another problem with doing the first as anything other than i suggested. it would allow people to get out of there name if they did something really crazy. gee.. i robbed that alliance. go inactive for x months and lookie here... my name disappeared and i still have the char.so i guess i could say i support the intention but not this implementation"

11/10/2010,"the current system makes nothing but victims. the wardec system as it is stifles the play of many, and decreases their enjoyment of the game. the war party always has an advantage because they declare war when they are prepared. the victims only start preparing when they get the notification of the impending war. the process is completely one sided.the war party often harasses the victims in order to extort funds. this game is rapidly becoming a game of scams, extortion, exploitation. change it so that actions by players give ""war rights"" instead of kill rights. when another player ninja salvages, suicides a transport, or can flips, this gives you the right to declare war. who cares about kill rights on the spot. if you out mining and someone suicides you, oh wow, you have the right to try to kill them. often times you are not going to be prepared at the time. instead, it gives you the right to declare war against the aggressor when you are prepared, not when they are. this means you cannot declare war unless you have war rights.keep the cost the same, if you change it to war rights. doesn't really matter then.the important part is to end the ransoms for no reason. some other player should not have the right to hold my game hostage unless i do something against them. the current systems stifles the play of many, while they are under a wardec. if players wanted to pvp, they would go to low-sec, null-sec. why even have high-sec if everyone can run around declaring war without reason or provocation.as matter of fact, i have a secondary proposal:if the system is not changed, i propose ""war week"" everyone during that week will go around and declare war on as many other corps as they can afford. this will create chaos and hopefully force ccp to respond."
11/10/2010,"the only reason peeps post this stuff is to troll, or looking to get flamed. probably a little of both.you are painting a broad brush stroke for the reason or the lack of going to war. and you are making assumptions based on your little tiny view of how things work in this here universe.essentially what effects you obviously is detrimental for all so it has to be tailored to your view of how things should be."
11/10/2010,"my little universe? lolwhat about yours, and who is the real troll. add something constructive, or dont troll.if there was a method that i could survey all the in-game players i would. and i bet you the results will show you that there are two distinct sides to this issue.side 1 : those who enjoy causing grief on other players through war-dec. they think it is all part of the game, and there is nothing wrong with it. its fine with them because they continue to get paid ransoms from corps that do not wish to play in their game. they call the otherside names and flame them when they try to fix a broken system.side 2 : those who want to play their game without the interference and disruption from others in high-sec. they think the war-dec system is completely one-sided. they think that the original purpose of the wardec has been subverted and exploited by those who want to try to make fast isk by ransoming others rather than doing the work themselves. the purpose of separate security levels of space is to provide areas of different play-style. the players who are good at pvp and really enjoy it go to null-sec. the players who want to explore and get their feet wet in pvp go to low-sec. those who want to play in high-sec don't want to be bothered with your pvp. if they chose to pvp, then they go to lower security space. simple enough for ya?all the war-dec system achieves is it forces players who do not chose to pvp on their own, to either pvp, or hide from the war. when they are hiding, they are not enjoying their game. can i speak for everyone on this point? sure i can. if they are hiding, they dont want to pvp. get this straight, some people dont want to pvp.pvp should not be forced upon them.if they are hiding from the war, how can they be playing? what are they doing while sitting in their station? make market offers, setting skill ques? you want to pretend that this is enjoying the game?survey:if you are a war-dec company, how many of your victims actually want to come out and fight you?how many enjoy the engagement?do you get ransoms from those who enjoy the engagement?i say with full confidence that you will only get a ransom from a corp that does not enjoy the engagement and does not want to pvp.if everyone enjoys the wardec system, then why do ransoms exist?ransoms only exist because many players do no want to pvp. if they did want to, then they would just fight you, and not pay a ransom."
11/10/2010,"either you're a complete choob or a troll, but either way i don't want you in my eve. also war-dec incoming. oh, that's right, you're in a noobcorp."
11/10/2010,"to troll is to post something that might be believable and draw out emo raging responses to perpetuate the thread into an epic ""gotcha"". however an opposing view, albeit somewhat gruff to your position is not a ""troll"".i posted a gentle flame. please note the difference and then we might be able to have a discussion about why you feel based on anecdotal evidence, the game mechanics should shift drastically to your point of view."
11/10/2010,"well, then by your definition ""to troll is to post something that might be believable and draw out emo raging responses to perpetuate the thread into an epic ""gotcha"". however an opposing view, albeit somewhat gruff to your position is not a ""troll""."" why then did you cal me a troll. my post is only a viewpoint on game mechanics and not something to catch a ""gotcha""but on the other hand, you have yet to reply to any of my points or present a counter argument. you seem to be on the troll, unless you present a counter argument.please, since you are so much the wiser, point out where i am wrong. give the argument. unless of course all you can do is flame and troll."
11/10/2010,"pro tip: if someone war decs you that you can't handle, hire someone that can.or make sure you have enough experienced pvp players in your corp to defend against such groups of people.corps that are simply full of noobs tend to be targets for this because they are defenseless. no surprise there..."
11/10/2010,(too) many wardecs happen on new industrialist corps and corps with few and new(ish) players. no real challenge in shooting a new player that spent their training towards the industrialist side of the game.and as for hiring a defending corp...not everyone buys isk through real money to have the few billions to hite others while having 3 months on their character.the system needs a review in order to at least reduce the bashing and griefing of totally defenseless parties
11/10/2010,highsec is noob space. if you're big enough to get griefer-decced then you should leave noob space.
11/10/2010,"this is true. and i would add that regardless of whether you are defenseless or not, you should have the choice to pvp or not. that is the purpose of having high security space.if i have plans for manufacturing, or inventing, or whatever, i might not want to pvp at the time, even if i am capable of defending myself. i may choose to pvp at another time, and if i do, there are plenty of places to go look for it."
11/10/2010,"i think the op might have the beginnings of an idea here. i just can't support the proposed solution.i do think that many industrial high-sec corps need more than 24 hrs to prepare for a war, and that those who thrive the tears of carebears need some more red tape in the way for wardecs. i just don't know how that would work, but i'm open to ideas. just not this one at this time."
11/10/2010,"no.you do not get sanctuary in high sec. high sec is safer not safe.the war dec system needs to be reworked, yes.... not neutered. and this is what you are asking for. flag pvp."
11/10/2010,"personally i don't want ""sanctuary"" but i don't care to pvp really. it has been nothing but loss and annoyance. ever time i deal with a wardec it usually means i get to pay for a month or more but not play.since you have agreed that something needs to change and the author suggested something you don't like, why don't you make a suggestion of how it could be made to work in your opinion. otherwise what you have said is nearly useless.back to the opening post - as for myself i don't like this current proposal as it doesn't let the legitimate corps run war-decs as they should. a boost in notice (maybe closer to 48 hrs to war) and a significant hike it war-dec costs plus shifting it to be paid daily would be more appropriate in my opinion. something more to the tune of approx 100 mill per day instead of 2 mill per week. at that cost it is enough to make you not want to go crazy but it is not unreachable. once again though this is the point of view of somebody who really doesn't care for pvp"
11/10/2010,"it is an issue!why are links longer on a larger planet?please explain how the size of a planet determines how close structures can be built to each other on that planet.the size of planet earth does not impose any distance limitations on how close i can build one house to another. i can put them right up against each other.what about the moon? is there any limitation to the distance that buildings could be constructed? following your logic, shouldn't they be closer on the moon since the moon is smaller than earth?no.the size of the planet does not determine the distance between structures.the only reason that structures ""appear"" to be further apart on a larger gas planet is because of the distance of one pixel. therefore this is a graphics problem. the size of the planet is expanded so that the structures can not be placed within one pixel of each other. because of the size calculations of the planet, this creates a longer distance of the links. the links should not get a longer distance just because the structures cannot be placed closer than one pixel.if the average distance of any other structure on any other planet is about 20km (for the closest you can get), then why should it be different on a gas planet?the only reason why you can't place a structure closer together is because of the distance of a pixel, not because of the size of the planet.all i propose is that changes be made to the calculations so that i can have links that are 20km apart, just like on any other planet."
11/10/2010,"the reason this happens is the pins sizes (and thus the minimum distance apart you can place them) are scaled directly tied to the size of the planet. they becomes, in essence, larger as the size of the planet increases. ccp needs to de-couple that scaling so that the minimum distance between pins is independent of the planet size."

11/10/2010,there should be a intensive refining array t2 or something that does not refine at 75% ( 25% loss ) but refines at the skill of the person who starts the refining processes.allowing that person to skill up that ore to level 5 ( because level 4 is really all you need in high sec ) and that could bring the refining % up to something like 90%.i am not asking for 100% - just something better than 75% with something that uses your skills.cheers'
11/10/2010,"a cap usage bonus at medium platforms makes very little sense as a whole. the cap usage amount is just not that big and is especially non-significant when you factor in cap boosters, which are kind of mandatory anyway.in case of prophecy, the bonus allows you to shoot longer, but what's the point in investing into this when your dps is that pathetic? it's like tanking a ship which does not do anything useful on the battlefield... oh, wait! that's exactly the second prophecy's bonus both of the bonuses of prophecy make the ship look like a heavily-armoured, extra durable infantryman's rifle, which yet projects 1mm bullets.what's the point in having those attributes in a weapon, which is a priori disposable? (prophecy is a cheap tech1 ship)the only purpose of cheap and disposable weaponry is to do damage. that's it."
11/10/2010,ship of another player...
11/10/2010,"why not? :) maybe it's a good idea :)there is so much another good ideas on forum, which i like, but don't care too :)"
11/10/2010,what if i want to test loot tables and chances but can not be bother to run to all regions of eve?
11/10/2010,"maybe i was wrong in assuming everyone thought it was the mechanics that start decreasing the effectiveness of point and click masses that eve is missing, judging by other people's responses. but if the realistic los and physics can't be implemented a stabilizing mechanic is needed. usually aoe damage and non-damage (both area and targeted) mechanics fill this role, but aoe in eve has either been too excessive (see old dd) or far too situational and limited (bombs being limited to one class of ship, and smartbombs are more 'aura' effect). non-damage suffers from the same area effect limitations (lol ecm burst) or actually lose overall effectiveness as fleet size increases. not to the point of being useless, but ecm in a small gang is radically different than ecm in a fleet.and i really wish the forums let you review the thread as you replied, i don't remember the other points i wanted to address and i don't feel like having multiple windows up to /forum effectively."
11/10/2010,"finn you're arguing with a group of people who honestly think ccp has a desire to stop large scale combat. which is so patently false it isn't even funny. their own cognitive dissonance prevents them from seeing that their view is in fact not one shared by the game developer or a very sizable if quiet part of the gaming population. ccp wants small gang and large fleet warfare to effect sov. that was the promise given in dominion. granted it failed because anything done well with a small gang is done better with a large one. they can't even realize that their classification of ""blobs"" is simply a group with more pilots than them. if you want forced teams that are always even go play wow for christ's sake. wars in eve have always and will always be won by ""blobs"". get used to it."
11/10/2010,"i think we should stop using blob to describe a larger force. blob = more than node capacity. anything else = superio(u)r fleet size.i'm still of the opinion large scale fleets can materialize in the absense of current standings and firmly believe that you don't need a multi-regional conglomorate to experience great fleet pvp. i wouldn't care to wager on developer opionion myself. they're going to work on whatever they deem worthy of their time and the players/csm really don't have much to do with voice their opinions and hope some kernal of it reaches ccp.at the end of the day there's going to be large naps, small naps, and alliances scattered here there and everywhere in between. but, the bogus opinion ccp is only interested in propping up this perpetual-node-crashing machine is pretty silly."
11/10/2010,"5 years ago the server couldn't handle 200 people. the servers are constantly being improved so the amount that ""breaks"" a node are higher and higher. so your point allows for much larger fleets than you think it does. and when they have the ability to dedicate several nodes to one system it will theoretically remove the cap of how many the system can handle."
11/10/2010,"it's an old eve whine, and i'm surprised i'm not more used to it by now, tbh. ""we have a large number of allies and a highly motivated player base that wants to pvp so we form large fleet. they blob.""""they bring fleets that are larger than strictly necessary and blob, we just want good fights and can't help it that so many of our members rally to cta's."" ""we have ehonor and are interested in ensuring good fights are had by all although we fly the best ships we can instead of rifter swarms, they have no ehonour and blob and they only care about winning at any cost."" then why remove them? and again, you changed the subject earlier when your proposal came up and never did explain exactly what you want. 1: remove ability to set standings and you gut a significant portion of the core content of eve, alliances can no longer determine who does and does not have docking rights in their stations and anybody launching an invasion can stage out of your own stations, your pos's can't be set to auto-fire on reds so they can simply camp out and gank people. or you can set your pos to fire on everybody, and then even people who you want to be able to sit there are at risk of being blasted to dust. 2: standings still exist but the icons for blue/red status no longer exist. has absolutely not effect at all as anybody with two brain cells to rub together has an overview set up so that they never see blues unless they specifically need to see/target them for some reason. nobody here, at all, has said that you do. nobody said that. it's been pointed out that large-scale conflicts are part and parcel of eve and, in fact, a major selling point of the game itself. it's also been pointed out that you can hardly have large-scale conflicts while somehow demanding that each side practice some sort of victorian degree of properness and restraint. syx already pointed out exactly why 'caps' don't work, and you've gone on repeating that anyways. it doesn't matter if the cap is hard or soft, it's totally unworkable (and your focus on the attacker and not the defender, likewise, makes no sense). if a system can take 1400 pilots before the system starts to see serious lag, and the defenders bring 1399 pilots (and they have absolutely no reason not to), then a 2 man attacking fleet is a ""blob"" under your metric. if the defending fleet doesn't bring as many pilots as they can, and then they lose? well, they have mighty mighty ehonor!!! and they've also lost significant assets, strategic position, momentum and morale. you can not buy ships with honor points. to say nothing of the fact that 'node death' is arbitrary and circumstantial, as i've pointed out several times and you've ignored several times. a system that's reinforced and sees combat right after downtime will perform a hell of a lot differently than a reinforced system that sees combat for 12 hours straight and has the gates littered with hundreds, or thousands of abandoned/lost drones and hundreds of wrecks. and cashing a node is hardly the end of a fight. node's get taken down and put back up all the time, then people just scurry to log in quickly and reform, and there are many, many stages of lag leading up to that point including but not limited to jump lag, minor module lag, moderate module lag, major module lag, crushing module lag, system-wide desynchs, etc, etc, etc. server instability is simply part of eve. **** happens."
11/10/2010,"so basically because nc can blob 5 times more than any other coalition, by default they have won eve, so really 0.0 is broken and all anyone needs todo is focus on spam naping in order to win.game over?fact of the matter is this blobbing is the issue, people want skill > numbers, otherwise ccp should prevent sov from changing and make it permanent since no other coalition can be bothered to lower themselves to mass naping and people prefer to recruit skilled players over stats.also lets not forget that goons were so obsessed with bob mass naping in the past that together with the nc wanted to rid the game of this type of game play. so whats stopping this happening again, well because if nc dies another nap fest will replace it.talk about becoming what you hate, again.either change the mechanics of fleet fights to favour skill > numbers or announce nc won due to more numbers and will eventually nap all of 0.0, because of this ccp speed up the process and just brand them sole owners of 0.0 aka new empire because pvp is something that needs to be avoided"
11/10/2010,deja vu all over again
11/10/2010,"you're ****ting up two threads now with the same jibberish but at least this one is actually about 'blobbing"" unfortunately you're just as incoherent and uneducated here as you are in the other thread that is completely unrelated to blobbing or fleet tactics at all.the problem with allowing small numbers of people to overpower large numbers is that if small numbers do well, why not bring more with the same abilities as those few and overwhelm even more?oh look the cycle has begun again.you cannot stop people from working together."
11/10/2010,"i am aware of that cycle which is why i stated already ""doing rock paper scissors"" wont work because the blob can just bring more of what the smaller force is.which is also why i am not keen on new ships designed to counter blobs, i am speaking of ways where blobs hold a risk without smaller groups sufferingif you think about it, only lag poses a threat to blobs but since it also affects small gangs too it hardly is a blob counter."
11/10/2010,"yah, most people don't really mind the ability to focus fire and such, they mind that their opponents can bring more people to focus fire which is just simply not faaaaaaaaaair. of course, strangely, they don't go around offering 1v1 to all the targets they find, as individual ships march out to the line of battle like ancient samurai accepting honor-deuls.curiouser and curiouser. to be honest i'm really not sure that's the case. nobody is forcing anybody to engage in the massive-scale grudgematches that are many large conflicts. instead of packing into a system to take an objective, it's still a (somewhat, after the nano nerf) valid tactic to get together a small gang and go hunting, and hitting the gtfo button once a force turns up that you can't gank. i think that's the main point that some of the people who are upset are losing sight of... if they can't manage to outfight a larger group, either they need to adapt or, failing that, they need to find something else to do. if i can't compete with an industrialist syndicate that regularly strips all the asteroid belts from entire constellations and has 100 people constantly running invention jobs with maxed out skills... i can either find some way to compete (doubtful), accept that i can't compete but still do my best in my niche, or find another niche. or, evidently, i can demand that ccp eliminate corps' abilities coordinate effort. that seems pretty popular recently. ""a fanatic is someone who can't change their mind and won't change the subject."" look, you just spoiled a perfectly content-free ragerant with elementary logic. wtf is up with that? of course, this is the basic issue and why some people are left raging against human nature, math, the laws of reality, what have you. even if we get to the holy grail of perfect small gang combat and good drugs for everybody, the first group to double their opponents' numbers will stand a very good chance of mopping the floor with them, looting the field, taking fewer losses and being able to, more easily, afford more of those kinds of fleets. which means they'll probably run more of those kinds of fleets. which means that someone, somewhere, will realize that if they can't match that double-sized fleet on their own, that if they team up with some other guys that the double-sizers were kicking in the shins, then maybe they can fight with even numbers. and, hell, if they can gather together a few more of the double-sizers' enemies and get them to work together, then they've got a very good chance of stomping those dastardly doublers right into the ground (except of course the doublers will be doing their best to try to find a tactical/strategic/numerical edge, too). it's funny that those who are demanding that skills should count more for numbers have evinced none of the skill required for them to outfight greater numbers. and instead what they most often really mean is that ""ccp > people who can cooperate better than me"". and, as always, there is already a game with millions of subscribers that keeps instanced combat as scrupulously fair as possible, and no guild can ""blob"" any other. it even has elves."

11/10/2010,"i really don't see the reason for arguing against people joining up. trying to take away the ability for people to work together is attacking a 'symptom', not a problem. finn and ed are right in that if ccp intended to ever put a hard or soft limit on numbers they wouldn't be so focused on their ""one server"" ideal. my harping on tactics and strategy is because it's a self rectifying cycle. you can still amass enough force to overcome a strategic advantage, but as the force expands it becomes harder to manage. if the fcs and wcs manage to employ the proper strategy with the larger force then of course they should win. that's why i said the mechanics are necessary, even if it allows the larger, smarter force to be more effective.i don't know. i just have an issue with fleet warfare seeming like 2 wraith and bc fleets coming head to head. sure one might have +2/+2 upgrades compared to the others +3/+3, but in the end it comes down to numbers and who focus fires correctly."

11/10/2010,"i'm a bit confused about what the point of this is.the csm has approved, what, 200 proposals by now? and yes, that list includes things like a rebalance of field commands -- why doesn't the nighthawk get more grid? (and another midslot and a higher base shield recharge to compensate)...i understand that you don't want cromo effect/double dee showing up to ramble about their own hairbrained schemes, but are we not to ask about particular proposals that have already been approved and gone nowhere? if not, what's the point? and honestly, even if we are, what's the point of that? hey, remember that stuff that we have been asking for over the past two years? we still want it.please provide some examples of questions that you think are appropriate, because your example of a long-standing balance issue as something that is not to be discussed is totally baffling."

11/10/2010,yes but even with that it doesn't begin to compare to the cash you can make in complete safety in empire. why the **** move to 0.0 if empire is *still* more profitable?the sanctum changes will increase the amount of people a system can support by about double. thats still less than half what they said systems would be able to supportedit: i do not think sanctums are the answeryour post has literally nothing to do with what this thread is about from any angle. read the op and respond accordingly or sit and spin you ****ty troll.
11/10/2010,"sheesh, i actually have to somewhat agree with the op. well, to a certain degree at least. i would want to argue the point though that the ""system support"", aka the/one pve element of dominion expansion needs to be the focus of change. i think pretty much the vast majority of 0.0 inhabitants can agree that the major revamp dominion brought us didn't turn out exactly to be what we did hope for. one way or another. but should we really argue/push for some minor tweaks in the area of income per system only?i do think that way we would simply risk ccp throwing us a small bone by, say, doubling the number of high-grade anomalies and try to sell this as a ""major fix"". considering there's so much more that needs to be adressed in 0.0 that would actually mean a negative effect coming thru. knowing how it often runs, having scored such a ""great success"", ccp would then prolly refrain from looking at nullsec issues for... ~18 months~? i'm not trying to say here the issue raised by the op is unimportant or negligible. but it should be the major point of content that the whole post-dominion situation is kind of found wanting. not an itty bitty point here and there. or, to put a more controversial/aggressive spin on it, the whole post-dominion situation is turning out to be unsatisfactory at best, system support just being yet another symptom of the whole issue. tl:dr - ccp needs to address the whole bag of problems dominion graciously dumped on us, not just patching up a little hole here and there when the whole boat is sinking."
11/10/2010,as for the it guy above. i agree with you. i was more pointing out that ccp put this new sov system in then promptly forgot about like they do everything else despite constantly promising us its designed in sucha way that lets them improve it easily.they did it with numerous other things before. in 5 years we may see a new sov system that sucks less with more reward but i doubt it.off topic quote removed. zymurgist
11/10/2010,"there's a bit more.what's currently on tq is lacking other important and vital mechanics, most importantly a way for holding corps to directly benefit from people killing npc in their space.the system taxation array as an ihub upgrade is long overdue and the same goes for treaties.the underlying problem is that nobody seems to care for 0.0 at ccp at this point. the lack of balancing work, support and game iteration is a very clear statement in that regard.as for the players supported, there is one problem if you just increase anomaly spawns: there is no good way to tell if someone is occupying an anomaly you have on scan or not, resulting in a lot of overhead since it's impossible to coordinate, even if everyone is in a fleet and on voicecoms.imo, agent missions are the vastly superior option due to their ability to scale well, unless the scanning- and fleet ui gets an overhaul.with that said, i very much agree that moderately increasing haven/sanctum spawn rates would be a very good idea."
11/10/2010,"well, we do get this new incursion **** now in 0.0 as well. so i'm looking forward to yet another big screwup in the next expansion instead of some needed fixes. *shrug* fits the current ccp agenda it seems, drop new stuff on the players no matter if they asked for it and ignore what they are actually asking for. at least if 0.0 is concerned...just wanted to add this to the topic, because if you happen to do anomalies in one of those affected systems it can screw up the ccp-promised ratios even more. apart from all the other issues it might get you."

11/11/2010,"i second this proposal.edit:one thing what about ability to use normal jump portal generators instead of just covert ops, give them 99% reduction for fitting and we would have a mini titan for a 10th of a price and smaller jump range that comes with it.this would also justify the small fuel bay and other drawbacks that bo's have, although sin and panther would still have useless bonuses that need to be tweaked."
11/11/2010,"general fix for them bo's: - increase fuel bay and/or decrease fuel consumption of portal - increase base jump range, or give a bonus for jump range, or both. - remove penalties for using cloak (but not the ability of using cov ops cloak), cloak velocity bonus should be replaced by said above jump range bonus.specific fixes: - sin's agility bonus is lol, sin's mass is lol, sin's agility is lol, sin's grid is, yet again, lol. change those for something more usefull like a drone bonus or a hull repairing bonus, since that's more useful than current bonus.- panther's speed bonus back in the nano age was good. with the nano nerf, not any longer. change it for a tracking bonus or a falloff bonus or whatever."

11/11/2010,"no (edit, see below: okay, if items are tradable and destroyable)and by the way: some people seem to forget, that we already have some cosmetic microtransactions for years: changing the portrait (10$) and moving character to another account (20$)you might also count plex as microtransactions, since you can use the isk to buy a ship you couldn't have otherwise (for example due to lack of time for playing/farming isk)the main difference - and the reason why plex are a good thing but microtransactions like '10$ for that hat' are bad:-with plex, the value (gametime) stays in game and can be used by another player-most bought items (ships) are produced by players, not seeded by ccp indefinatelyanother thought:if microtransacted items are allowed to be traded/contracted, this would result in some interesting things:-if the items are destroyable, it would create a constant demand for those items, similar to plex-the isk-price of those items would be tied to (and will most likely also influence) the exchange rate of plex ($ <> isk)-consequently, the relative isk-prices for those items will be set in stone by ccp and won't allow normal supply-demand market dynamics(example: if <fancy hat> costs 10$ and <fancy dress> costs 50$, <fancy dress> will always cost 5x the isk as <fancy hat>)hm, thinkin about it like that, i have to elaborate on my original answer:if microtransacted items are both, tradable and destroyable (like plex), it might be acceptable.this would just make the eve-community as a whole (read: the people okay with spending money for items or isk) pay a bit more for eve in general, without creating an unfair advantage for people with more money.this is what we basically already have with plex..."
11/11/2010,i am very much *in favor* of adding micro transactions for cosmetic purposes. i would like ccp to make more money from people who wish for whatever reason to change how they or their ships look. it will be more money for ccp and no cost to how the game is played. it will indeed be cooler to see many different ships etc. neural remap: i agree thats not cosmetic. but its not so bad. mainly i'm glad you can get these items *through plex* and therefore through isk. i hope they keep as many of these microtransactions through plex as possible. that way it at least has some bearing on the eve economy. allowing people to make micro transaction through plex as opposed to being forced to pay directly is something we as players should strive for. that way players who want to acquire this stuff with isk can do that. for example if you buy a plex it may allow you to buy 3 sets of clothes and 1 redo of your face (credit with a plastic surgeon) or 1 gender change or bloodline change etc. one plex may also allow you to reskin 60 ships or something. or you can make different bundles for each plex. if you fly many different fits of the same ship having different skins for each ship fit may actually have some practical use.
11/11/2010,no.
11/11/2010,"yes, take your time and make eve better. i dont want shiny new tools, i like eve and want play the game as it was promised and everyone expected.no new expansions anymore until the game works bug free as everyone expect it.make better whats there."
11/11/2010,"the bizarre thing is that if the ship being repaired shoots a neutral or a stargate, concord will kill the remote repper ship too. so the aggression consequence chain is already there and recognized by npcs. seems like it would be easy to apply that to gates and stations"

11/11/2010,supported
11/11/2010,"not supported.this is the only reprieve from a failing war dec system that needs an overhaul.war decs are out of hand and need to be changed.the cost of war dec is too little. it is too easy to declare war against anybody for any reason, and most of the time, the reason is to extort ransom.the neutral/alt remote repping is the last line of defense against griefers. you can not change this without changing the war-dec system and putting more restrictions on declaring war.otherwise, just line everyone up in a row like ducks and start picking them off. i mean really how patheticly easy do you want it? you dont want pvp, all you want are easy targets and easy money through ransoms.suggested fix: 1. stop pvp'ing in empire2. stop playing station gamesstation games are nothing more than a dps race...unless you have a remote repper. bring a rr into the picture and you actually have to think about tactics and come up with methods to counter the counter attack. without the neutral rr the agressors (the war-dec griefers) will always win. i assume thats what you want anyway. easy victims.strongly not supported. the war-dec system needs to be fixed."

11/11/2010,"there is a difference between building a ship with a utilitarianistic point of view and building a ship to make the design intentionally appear as an afterthought. there is no efficiency in a ship when all its parts are separated in random directions and seem to hang out in their own area, in real life it would also make a ship incredibly hard to repair as the entire ship is made up of random unique pieces made to cater simply to the chaotic design of that particular ship.also i hate the moa hull"

11/11/2010,it looks unique and any look topics are lost from the beginning since you're not a space ship designer living thousands of years from nowbeside this game has a milion more important problems than designing new models no one's going to look on 90% of the time anyway

11/11/2010,"updated and fixed some gramatical errorsthis proposal was written to cover the eventuallity of a new microtransactional payment system being introduced to eve online. currently it seems ccp is ignoring the outcry and votes regarding mts and they will introduce them whether the playerbase likes it or not.this proposal is not for microtransactions, but meant as a guideline for ccp to follow so that they don't break the game anymore than they already will by introducing them to the game.the proposal:that microtransactional items can only be purchased with plex, or if necessary, a more granular currency that is sourced from plex exclusivelythat all items purchasable using microtransactions be destructablethat all items purchasable using microtransactions be vanity onlythat ccp defines and publishes a set of descriptions and rules as to what can be or will be purchasable via microtransactions prior to this payment systems inclusion ingame and that ccp strictly adheres to these rules as closely as is possible for ever more.that the csm must be notified before any new microtransaction or microtransactional mechanic is introduced to the game (to avoid any more marketing nightmares, and ""oh, we didn't expect that!"")before any microtransactional item or microtransactional mechanic is introduced on the test and live server ccp releases the details and reasoning via the csm to the playerbase to gather comments and suggestions before its release.that ccp actively monitors the effects of microtransactions on the cost of plex and the market, and acts accordinly to ensure there are no adverse effects using all resources at their disposalmicrotransactional items or the microtransactional currency can only be purchased with plex exclusivelyall mictrotransactions can be bought using plex, or if necessary a more granular currency that can also only be purchased with plex. ie. if a hat could cost 1/2 a plex, you wouldn't have to waste a whole plex to buy it.microtransactional purchases are destructableif someone buys something via microtransactions then that item must be able to be destroyed by other players.microtransactional purchases are vanity onlyitems directly purchased via microtransactions have no effect ingame other than looking cool.ie. you can buy a pink hat, buy a new paint job for your ship from a colour palette specific to its race, account services etc.defined rules for items than can be purchased via microtransactionsccp defines and publishes a set of rules and descriptions for what items and the types of items that can be purchased via microtransactions and they will follow these rules as closely as is possible. changes to this definition should be published before it is rewritten.ccp notifies the csm before the introduction of any new microtransactions or microtransactional mechanicccp will inform the csm before they introduce anything new to do with microtransactions and use them as a preliminary sounding board before this information is released to the playerbase.publish the intent to introduce new microtransactions and microtransactional mechanics to the playerbaseccp will publish details and reasoning behind new microtransactions and mechanics relevant to them to the csm to be passed onto the playerbase to get feedback and suggestions before they are implimented and released.while i would not expect ccp to follow every item on here i believe that these few guidelines would help keep the playerbase happy and curb much of the fear surrounding this issue. microtransactions are coming whether we want them or not and we need to make sure that they do not unduly break the game or our community.cerbus"

11/11/2010,"ccp has already indirectly announced that microtransactions will be introduced through interviews on external websites and to the csm during the october summit. while they've yet to confirm which microtransactions they'll introduce you can now use plex to pay for some services (new portrait and character transfers) although i doubt there is anyone that will complain about these as they have no real effect ingame except for the power of 2 which is available to everyone anyway. the eurogamer article inparticular is an interesting read, see page 3 specifically.for some reason i do not think ccp will find the results of the crowdsources and other assembly threads to be relevant and the gates opening is inevitable.[td]"
11/11/2010,"we will evolve just like everyone else. we will certainly not become a dinosaur. that has not been our style.this quote made me laugh, following the pack and doing what everyone else is doing may be good if you bruisness model is to maximize profit over teh course of a few years, but what has made eve such a great game is because they have historically defined the terms of evolution. this is a sad quote really, conformist.and the devotd, loyal player base is exactly what is being thrown out with the bathwater here. i speak from expereince having seen a huge number of oldtimers leave over this mt stuff. bad bugs and poor patches are one thing, mts are another."
11/11/2010,"i'm not sure all your bullet points are realistic, however, supported in the spirit of ccp actually having a public policy with regard to mt in eve...and to announce updates to that policy when it changes. when asked about details related to destructibility, tradability, etc. for vanity items, ccp indicated such decisions hadn't been made. i find it difficult to understand why they would go forward with such a controversial thing before ironing out the details so that they can communicate clearly with players about it and so that the community can understand the full impact of such things on the game.with regard to plex only for mt items, that doesn't offer any granularity--it will force everything to be packaged in bundles valued at approximately one plex. in the world of vanity items in particular, this seems a bit inflexible and will force people to buy a bundle of items potentially consisting of 99% stuff they don't want just to get that one item they do want."

11/11/2010,microtransactions?bye bye ccp.
11/11/2010,"when you trade a plex you are trading ""30 days game time"" and swapping for isk.this isk isn't generated from no-where, same as buying a character - someone has spent the time to train it.swapping a plex for services can be ingame cost to out of game benefit, and out of game cost to out of game benefit, but it doesn't effect ingame. being able to purchase ingame items soley from rl money opens up the out of game cost to ingame benefit which is where things get dodgey. if these microtransactions use plex then its pretty much the same thing that happens now as long as these items are destroyable and/or vanity only, if they use another currency to make sure that the plex market isn't unduly effected then this leads to the darkside.i haven't yet seen ccp mention if these microtransactions would use plex or not, although its probably a sure thing, but i hope to gods if they do turn to the dark side that its paved with plex and not cash.the biggest problem other than that is that ccp says this is only a test.<cough>sure it is.didn't you just get a massive million dollar cash injection from your shareholders/ investers??? is this the reason for the double dipping?hmm.wtf ccp."
11/11/2010,"you are right, the isk is not generated from nowhere, it is generated from rl-money. instead of using that isk to buy things in the ingame economy and keeping the economic system closed to the outside world, every economic transaction ingame now does not have a solely internal economic mechanism to explain it but can be influenced by th real economey outside. in effect, all the economic analysis in eve is completly broken because of this (spacific data is usable, but is also corrupt). it would be the same if we tried to measure todays economy but also include some kind of religious metaphysical currency into the mix - i.e. the reason you are rich is because god loves you and rewards you with money. so love is now a second curency, and invisible currency that can be used to get real money. with character transfers, the problem is different because charactrs are a product of the game - klike ships or mods. the end remains the same though, real life money is converted into isk and spent ingame to purchase ships, mods and/or more characters. characters in this case is just a product.basically, with the way plex works right now, eve is not a sandbox, and the addition of more ways to use plex will continue to degrade that to the point it becomes a mere marketing scheme. should the plex market be taken out and characer bazzar terminated, then the game will return to being a true sandbox again (it was once).the debate on what is and what is not spacifically a mt is academic, the effect it has in the game is very much evident in the requests people make in th suggestions forums and the culture that has emerged in the past year of people taking for granted the isk to dollar ratio and profiting ingame off of it. i cannot see the difference between rmt and plex other then who makes the money, and how accountable and controled that process is - but the end result is the same. money buys isk."
11/11/2010,"alright i was talking to one of my out of corp buddy's lately and he mentioned a problem he was having. he currently flys in a small section of low sec ( no names ) and regularly must transport large quantities of what ever to that system. how ever roaming gangs have been a problem. even when flying a hard hitting escort fleet most gangs auto lock the indys/occasional freighters , pop them and then try an get the cargo , all while the escort trys to defend. and while they usually obliterate most of the attackers the indys usually suffer ship loses and no bs/bc can hold that much cargo.to this end i suggest a new module/flying technique.in any space movie bigger combat ships generally defend smaller ships by shooting fast and actually getting in between the attacker and the target acting as a physical shield. due to the current setup of the eve game engine i doubt that that can be effectively done so i suggest 2 options.option 1 skilled based ability - you select a right click option to defend, and as long as you stay with in 3.5k of a ship you take 20% * skill level of any damage inflicted to that ship. does not affect other ships that are ""defending""option 2 new module - a special ecm style device that projects a bubble 3.5 k wide. any ship inside this bubble cant be targeted with the exception of the host ship , but at the same time cant target anything itself. ships may elect to not receive this bonus through a right click menu option."
11/11/2010,"lol @ mobile rr safespot.i do agree tanking is something that would be interesting along the lines of your option 1, but as a module. mostly because eve seems slow to adopt the tank - dps - heal mechanic, partly due to tanking..not existing, and logistics being a bit straightforward and needing more sp.so sure, +1 to the spirit of this thread if not the specifics."
11/11/2010,"option 2 would be best. anyone within the 3.5k (skill dependent?) bubble would be unable to be targeted. the ships inside the bubble will be able to lock the ships outside but only the ship that is powering the bubble can be targeted from outside, once inside the bubble, everything is fair game. the ship would be a t2 ship cruiser sized hull. any ship within the bubble will be unable to receive rr support from inside or outside the bubble.this would not be over powered because the ship with the bubble would be able to be killed quite easily when the bubble is up. the bubble would also make it impossible for any of the ships inside of it to be repped, making any logistics ships in the bubble ""trapped.""or you might have to install a special form of eccm on your ship to be able to target outside of the bubble while it is up."
11/11/2010,"manual flight controlorbit the ships/or other closer and faster , or farther and slower, all goodplease give us a reticle and manual flight control option. let us seperate the real skilled pilots from the rest out there.allegiance(game from microsoft, very old one in fact) does well with this.{sorry about that, just figured it would be an easy ""comparison""}"

11/11/2010,"unfortunately, eve is not set up to be a flight simulator. there's too much happening on the servers as it is to add the extra overhead of accounting for what could be second by second changes in direction from all the pilots in the system.adding this kind of support would basically require them to re-architect the game completely. not supported."

11/11/2010,"lol.allegiance was a great game, though."
11/11/2010,this would be such a nightmare. no.
11/11/2010,"lol ... not the least bit threatened ... first before you want a major overhaul of the war dec system ... 1) show the masses you have a grasp of whats going on and whats going wrong ... i posted a few questions to help you get that across but was met with ... ::reported:: ( lol ) please leave .. right now you're another, 'hey this game is great ... i'm gonna play it for the rest of my life ... but this is what you need to change ... to make it that much better for everyone ...' trial pass player.2) post with your main .. if you're so confident and back you words ... why be scared of repercussions ... if not .. you're no better that every other trolling alt out there ...you're trying to gain support ... credibility helps this subject has come up every few months for the last 5 years ... trust me ... no body knows how borked the war dec system is better than i do ... but ... ccp has shown its not a priority of theirs ... so save your breath anyways .. good luck in your crusade ..."
11/11/2010,supported. wars cost corporations isk and profitable corporations are more useful to concord than non-profitable ones.
11/11/2010,"well pitboss, i can understand his fear. too many wardecs have been started by people against other players they couldn't create a constructive argument against on the forums. its both petty and amusing considering that this thread is mostly about putting cap on that kind of bs. however, pitboss is also correct. this is an important argument and to fight it you need proper credibility. posting about it from an alt is kinda like throwing stone with notes tied to them through your opponent's window and expecting them to think you are more than just a mad man."
11/11/2010,"and the second i do, my corporation gets wardeced. no thanks. i rather just deal with people like pittboss than to cost my entire corporation a month's work of annoyance.towards the general idea of why ccp doesn't have an interest:why not? what is more important than adjusting (not changing) code to match the growing isk inflation within the game? i understand that ccp is busy with other things, but even so there are many items in this game that are half-done or completely and utterly broken. yes, the game runs ""decently"" with ""minimal bugs"" which is what to be expected to play a game without major worries, but when it comes to changing code than piling more ""half baked"" code ontop of each other... bad things are going to happen. yes, wardec prices are not on the priority list... but why is dust 514 more important than fixing the tremendous amount of lag for fleet battles or the amount of minute bugs/changes that still need to be fixed (like adding probes to overview-originally impossible due to legacy code????, removing the cost for suicide gankers, removing the insurance for self-destructing...) and many more. the only change was the p-nerf some time ago to the wardec system, which forced alliances to stop insta-dec-destroying corporations without it costing them an arm and a leg and a few kidneys (considering the fact its easier to wardec multiple corporations at once to keep the stove burning). even so, the relative cost is still cheap compared to the amount of people in said alliance. nevertheless, this did not stop the cheapness towards corporation on corporation wardec prices.maximum wardec prices:b * (n +1) * (w + 1) = 2 million * (3 + 1) * (3 * 1) = 18 million per week, which is still cheap (maxed out on both ends).i claim bs if fixing garbage code is least important than adding more modules to the system. i know that adding more code to something that doesn't work at 99-100% is going to cause major problems later. major problems. i understand that fixing wardec prices is not a priority, but why can it not be considered past face value?"
11/11/2010,"""provoke"" is also a relative term here because there's no universal ""right"" or ""wrong"" in eve. it's all in how players dispense their justice. to him, u killing him was aggression, no matter how ""justified"" your reason was but don't get me wrong--i'm not saying u shouldn't have done it. but when u already have a corp formed and he tries to tear it apart, there's a simple solution--move to an npc corp. u don't have to say goodbye to your corpmates 'cause that's what public channels r for (i still use them after i left mine).then the target corp should've already known what to do when war decced because of experienced leadership. (durh...common sense). maybe if the aggressed no longer have the option to pull out of the war but they do so it works just fine."
11/11/2010,and that is exactly what you will get if the war-dec system is not fixed. is it the policy of ccp to discourage player owned corps? or do they desire player owned companies?what is the point of making goals and trying to build up a company if some yayhoo can come along and harass that company until it pays a ransom? why would anyone want to play as an industrialist? why would anyone want to play as some form of harvester?you will end up with nothing but the pvp'ers left. all your easy targets will leave the game for some other game.what sort of game will you have then? how much business will ccp lose because of it?the war-dec system is used for nothing but ransoms. it needs to be fixed.
11/11/2010,"not supported, the war dec mechanic does need a looking at but this is a bad idea.the only reason people get dec'd in the first place is:1. they ****ed someone off2. they look like a juicy target (be this isk, tears or both related)3. someone has been hired for the dec (linked to point 1.)the whole it being used as a grief engine, welcome to eve online you get a 24 hour warning telling you that someone doesn't like you and if you don't heed the warning and run around in your 10+ billion isk ship then you only have yourself to blame.from what i have seen most corps with newbies in will have a few vets and you see posts in c+p from time to time the newbies who are suited to this game asking what they should do and players always give them the usual advice of flying cheap, use alts etc."
11/11/2010,signed. id base it off of how many people are in corp/alliance and how many corps are in alliance though.
11/11/2010,"its way too small personally. maybe its a small complaint, but imo it could be largerlook at the size of the aggression timer? its much larger and in color.thanks!!( image of the current session timer )"
11/11/2010,"oh visual size, i was thinking you wanted to toy with the duration. i'd personally like to see a countdown instead of a spinning circle, but making it larger is a good step."
11/11/2010,"to be totally honest, i always wondered why something so innocuous, and yet so critical, is so tiny. also, it could really do with perhaps appearing in multiple locations and as mentioned with different display options. i myself like the spinning, but others want numbers!viva la ui improvements!"
11/11/2010,"yeah, i didn't even know what that was until you pointed it out (i thought it was my computer loading graphics)."
11/11/2010,"supported. kinda hard to see with all the other icons. maybe not a displayed timer, but at least in color and distinguishable."
11/11/2010,a-yup.
11/11/2010,"yes, it should also show the countdown without having to hover over it, for those ocd people who need to switch ships in the first possible momennt."
11/11/2010,"this.i suppose local was designed to be a social tool, but as it stands today it's nothing more than a brainless friend/foe assessement tool.editing here to also state that local denies all cloacked operations of their role. maybe you cannot see them, but you know they are there."
11/11/2010,"indeed, it would have to be an option that could be enabled/disabled at will. and then you'd need to put a system in place to ensure that there are no free loaders."
11/11/2010,id love to see this implemented at the corp level vs the alliance level. this would be a big thing for pos keepers.
11/11/2010,awesome anti-blob feature.
11/11/2010,"in general, i like this idea.i would tend to think the system would be more 'ping' based, like sonar.but i love the idea of giving the destroyer another role besides salvager."
11/11/2010,good idea! its gonna take some work to sort out but i hope to see it implimented.
11/11/2010,"i got an idea. how about give the dessies a modual that can find the sb on the d-scan like janos said when active and sucking cap, but they will have to use it to pinpoint their distance and location in space, and once they get their range and degrees on d-scan down to 5 they can fire this decloaking thingy that takes like a charge, and some time to charge up before firing, and 50% of the dessies cap, and give the modual a long cooldown. the shot will creat a decloaking zone at the distance and degrees on the d-scan decloaking the ship that may be there for lets say 30 seconds. maby also make it have a minimal range off grid so it is stuck to having to use the d-scan range thing to bump the sb.the effect can be seen on the system map so probers can quickly probe out the cloakie ship and jump it, but a smart cloakie ship will just warp away though.see it as some kind of depth charge. though jumping between safe spots or staying off the dessies d-scan would be the best way to avoid it.ps:on second thought this may be a bit usless or op depending on how it would be introduced."
11/11/2010,"after spending months training for mining and mining upgrades and a buddy's toon spending the same amount of time for missioning, it is very apparent that i took the wrong path. in the same amount of time, he can make more than double the amount of isk missioning level 4 missions.i understand that macro miners are screwing the market for minerals but there must be a solution so that someone running missions and someone mining in make close to equivalent isk. for me, i think i am gonna park my hulk and start the missioning route.a possible solution, reduce the amount of ore that is in high sec roid fields significantly, making it so that a hulk can mine it out in a couple of hours - this forces real miners to move around and would discourage macro mining thus increasing the price or ore and in turn all products on the market.thats my 2 cents, any comments?"
11/11/2010,answer: sansha incursions killing the macro miners.
11/11/2010,i couldn't agree with you more.mining ark in a wh while someone does a sleeper site still brings in 1/5th the amount of isk value they do.ccp has clearly shown they do not want to / or cannot do anything about macro-mining.1 hour of minining should bring in the same amount of isk vs 1 our of missioning.i don't understand why they skew the bounty's on missions so high - but leave the ore return so low.skilling up in mining is a complete waste of time in my opinion as well.
11/11/2010,"let's see--as a miner:1. do u need to train guns or missiles so u can actually shoot something else that's not a rock?2. do u need to heavily train shield/armor skills?3. do u need to train for capacitor recharge so your tank doesn't cap out?4. do u need to train for weapon upgrades, regular and advanced, as well as electronics and engineering to even be able to fit your ship to handle a lvl 4?5. do u need to train the social skilltree for better agents, payouts, and standings that actually gets u lvl 4 access in the first place?didn't think so. and that's not factoring in training battleships or hacs. hell, try training for a marauder or t3--it's a lot more expensive to lose than that hulk. then u'll have something to really cry about.p.s. your ""solution"" won't even discourage a macro miner at all when they just move to different belts."
11/11/2010,"anna,lets look at the time it takes to skill up vs all the skills you mentioned.par for par, hour for hour / weeks for weeks... in 1 month / 3 months / 5 months i can guarantee you the time trained for skilling up a miner vs a pve mission runner - the mission runner is always ahead.i do not agree with your ""post"".my hour of play should be the same value as your ""hour of play""."
11/11/2010,"1. then calculate the whole thing if u're so sure or should we just all safely assume u're talking out your ass?2. furthermore, why should your profession be just as profitable when it's so easy to the point where it can be macro'd so u can afk the whole time? bet u didn't know that huh? 3. u don't agree, fine. u wanna be lazy like everyone else, fine. deal with everyone else lazing it up and flooding the market with tons of cheap ore and minerals."
11/11/2010,"anna,i do not disagree with what you are saying - thus, parking my hulk and training all of the skills you mention above. it will allow me to get not only isk, but lp and standings for my time. it will also allow me to get implants, federation ships, etc for myself with the lp as opposed to buying them from market. the rewards of mission runners go way beyond miners... and the risk of losing your ship is pretty low. not very many missions have warp scram ships, and when they do, your drones make quick salvage of the frigs that have them. not only that, everyone can check out what the mission is about and how to go about killing everything online before they even start the mission. the non existent ai that enemy ships have and the consistency of resistance makes a mission runner just as mindless a task as a miner.a mission runners skills will also take them to other aspects of the game - low sec, null sec, wh space.... miners require mission runners ( pvp'ers ) with them to do any of that."
11/11/2010,"that's the reward of active play and more skillpoints spent to access lvl 4s. see how that works?1. it still takes time to train t2 drones to swat down the smaller ships. try using t1 drones and see how long it takes to kill an elite frigate. either case, it's still more risk to face lvl 4 rats altogether than frigate belt rats that never warp jam.2. the fact still remains--u can't afk in a mission without missing rat kills. afk for 23 hours with macro mining, u don't miss anything at all. but i'm glad u totally ignored the skill-training comparison mentioned--it further proves my point.1. yes, u need combat pilot skillsets to mission because active combat should be rewarding, not automating a program to shoot inanimate rocks which don't shoot back while u do something else.2. u can't turn the same char into a low sec pirate unless u plan to mission in low sec. and if u think low sec missioning is so glamorous, try it. the pirates there will thank u for it. 3. unless u're stupid, u don't need a blob escort to babysit u, even as a miner, because no one with a brain requires anyone else to go anywhere safely. in your case, though, maybe u would need one..."
11/11/2010,"lol, you seem angry and aggressive to a simple topic like this. fact of the matter is, if every miner out there does what i am gonna do, you will not be able to buy your fancy mission ship cause there will not be anyone mining the minerals to build it.mining is a necessary evil in the game - hopefully the removal of macro miners will help solve the problem..."
11/11/2010,"anne,i will try to prove my point without calling you an ass/stupid or any other childish name calling as you have done. i will try to keep this forum have a little respect between its members and its dialog.i simply stated that everyone's time is equal.lets start brand new toons -if you ar able to skill up ""gunnery"" for 1 month and i am able to skill up mining for 1 month - the return on investment (roi) should be 'close'its not remotly close.you state you need to ""activly"" be there to mission.im pretty sure you could go to a mission and ""tank"" a mission for quite a while without firing 1 shot and without losing your ship. just as a miner can click on a roid and walk away.you need to activly lock on to new targets / roids run out and need to be activly re-locked/ore needs to be moved to a can or somewhere as well.your point of using a macro is void in this conversation as macro's are against ccp policy and against the eula.so wether you go pew pew some rats or pew pew some ore - the return is not equal.not even with t2 crystals.have a smurfy day."
11/11/2010,"high sec is noob space. if you're still there after playing eve for months and you're not a war deccer or market trader then you're doing it wrong.nullsec has much more valuable ore and you'll rarely die if you're smart. join a corp that holds nullsec space and you'll make a lot more isk.also, eve isn't about making money. that's what real-life jobs are for. eve is a game, do what you think is fun in it."
11/11/2010,"slimy,the comparison started for us when in a c2 wh, comparing the ark vs a 100% anom sleeper site.i have not ventured into null sec yet. testing the waters in a wh :)i only wish i skilled up in pve first and then mining. cheers'"
11/11/2010,"i'm merely pointing out the obvious, something that even u r mentally unable to even understand. fortunately, fact of the matter is, u're not everyone--sry to burst your bubble. therefore, there will always be miners, despite what u wish in your fantasy land. remove the macros first, then talk about profitability.respect is earned, not given. apparently, u're used to having things your way all the time without even trying/thinking but too bad it's not the case here. so based on your posting, what's more appropriate for u? troll? carebear? ignorant? stupid? or all of the above?it's not remotely close because it takes more than gunnery training to do a lvl 4, not that u'd know anything about this.1. tanking mission rats does not make u isk.2. oh no--u have to relock on a new roid 'cause it finally ran out in 15-30 min when u could've survey scanned it beforehand. poor u. can't imagine the stress u'd be under having to relock ships every minute or less. 3. so go train gunnery to replace the strip miners, go into a lvl 4 with your hulk and ""tank"" all the rats (and kill them too) if u think it's as effortless as u make it out to be.and your babbling of ""rules"" is simply babbling because rules r meaningless if they're not enforced.refer to the rest of my posts for once. next."
11/11/2010,time to fly a drake with this fit:

11/11/2010,"you can still see your overview, there's no problem here"
11/11/2010,"well i first ran into this when i was flying through space and switched my wallet division in my corp to transfer isk from that division. all of a sudden i couldn't jump through the gate because i had session change from changing the wallet division. ok, i can understand cession change for changing ships in a hanger or docking and undocking, as it takes time for your pod to move between ships. but seriously, why is there a need for session change timers on corp wallets?"

11/11/2010,it must be too hard to reach your hand into your other pocket in a spaceship.
11/11/2010,"very recently in a dev blog, some things about the incursions were outlined as follows:ccp has always prided itself on being a sandbox game where people can choose their own destiny and create goals and act toward them. now before going further i will admit i liked the idea of this expansion.....in theory. but now not so much. it is one thing to give people tools and opportunities to get them to work together because they share common goals but it is an entirely different thing to force a situation where they must work together to accomplish something that they care little about before they can continue on. it chips away at the sandbox and lets sand out. we need more sand, not less and this seems like an instance ccp is letting sand out. i don't think there is any pvp corp/alliance out there that is going to be fighting and when an incursion happens they'll ask for a cease fire so they and the enemy can go kill it before resuming their battle. it just doesn't work.as to the penalties themselves. from an ingame role play perspective they don't even really make sense. a reduction in your shield/armor resists. ok did the sansha tow some sort of tcu with them that somehow gimps our ships? perhaps they went to wormhole space and brought back with them a pulsar or something? if this penalty occurs it needs a logical story reason behind it and i have not seen one yet.reduction of weapon damage. i can almost see this one being ok....if it was restricted to the incursion site. maybe the sansha could just have uber resists and this would work out to where you would feel you are doing less damage. but like the above, since it affects a whole system there needs to be reason behind it and again this feels like you are letting sand out of the box and forcing a situation.cyno jamming. now this one i can actually see happening. since the sansha are capable of opening wormholes on their own it is not too much of a stretch that their wormholes create intense spatial distortions in that system that might throw off the cyno signals for large ships. covert cynos are fine because they only allow select ships to use them so i figure they work on a very tight frequency below what normal cynos work on. npc bounty reduction. again this seems forced and aimed at mission runners specifically. though the argument could be made that the first 2 effects are also this as well. do player ships somehow lose their signal to concord? does concord say ""fu, there is an incursion that is more important"" again what is the reason behind such a change?so what could be done? how about this set of penalties instead:"
11/11/2010,could this be the end to botting? lets hope so
11/11/2010,"how about we try it out before whining and saying it sucks. i actually think its a good idea.also, if you think about reduced resistances and reduced damage, this would mean that ships/structures with normally a lot of hp and low resists would gain some usefulness in this situation, since hp is not reduced. augoror navy issue anyone? lol..j/kalso, since both sides of a battle are affected by this, the battle will go on like normal, except in the case of ships/structures with a lot of hp and low resists.and yes, i'm sure concord does say ""fu, there is an incursion that is more important"" since were fighting for the freedom of the galaxy, not just some puny one shot mission. if you don't like it, then of course you can blow up the sanshas and get rewards from concord for that, or go do your level 4's in a different system for a while."
11/11/2010,"yeah i've tried using the slider but its not very specific or precise on how it works. i mean, there's no specific way to avoid 1.0 systems but not avoid 0.9 systems, etc."

11/11/2010,"i'd like to keep it like afterburners, so it would off line the moment you enter warp, so you'd have to enable it again out of warp. it would allow you to enter warp faster as it would let you align faster. you'd still have to get up to speed and it costs a mid slot. for the purpose of warping it only seems worth it for industrials and any ship doing courier.even in the case of using it for warp, it would be the same as using inertial stabilizers. faster, not instant. using both together would be interesting though, that may be near instant for something that already was entering warp quick. frigate sized ships mainly. maybe make it disabled by webbers or something? if you fill your lows with inertial stabs and you have both an afterburner and a thruster, there's not much left in the way of defense or offense.what? manual control? what is this i don't even.that is really over complicating such a simple module. it's no more than an active version of inertial stabilizers. that means you can turn faster. that's all it means. after talking with some people in game about it i am start to lean more with letting it be activated with afterburners, otherwise it'd only ever be used for warping. i still stand by there needing to be some sort of penalty if that is the case. or maybe add it as a role bonus on ships that would benefit from it, so interceptors or something would get ""role bonus: able to use afterburner and maneuvering thrusters at the same time."" so it needs a penalty to use both and/or a role bonus to use both.another option i'd go for is keep the penalty from inertial stabilizers when using both an afterburner and maneuvering thruster. using it alone, no penalty, using it with an afterburner/mwd, 20% increased signature radius? what it seems to me that this would amount to is being able to orbit something closer without losing speed."
11/11/2010,"so basically an active mod that makes you align quicker? i suppose it would be useful on ships with atrocious align times. i believe titan pilots like to have a 100mn mwd for use to make them align quicker (correct me if i'm wrong in that case). so this could be useful on pretty much all capital ships, an orca and haulers, so you could save your low slots for cargo expanders while being able to boost your align time. i'm not sure what the drawbacks should be, but i'm thinking a sig radius boost like istabs, so that you don't become invincible to gatecamps."
11/11/2010,"correct me if im wrong but most ships sub cap (barring orcas and freigters) have relatively good align times. ccp made changes so that the align isnt what takes the most time.. its the compensation for inertia. that takes a while. and if this is an auto version that counters inertia drift then be prepared for the barrage of minmatar ships that use it to get their traversal up to a rediculous amount.it would unbalance the game for sure. sb's would be relatively uncatchable with a new faster align time, as would inerceptors. the only way you could restrict it would be putting a biiig cpu penalty on it. but then ud have to augment all bc ships and above to have bonuses in cpu reductions to that specific module... a lot of work for ccp for suuch little difference/convenience."
11/11/2010,correct me if i'm wrong but then they would already be able to do that by just using inertia stabilizers or low friction nozzle joints which have the same effect as the suggested module.
11/11/2010,"afaik yes, which kinda makes this module null and void.. except id guess the op is suggesting an active version of an inertial stabalizer that has a massive negative inertia multiplyer, waay above and beyone the -20% u get from a passive inertial stab ii.i guess a multiplyer of -50% to inertia when active. which is kind of insane, even with a stacking penalty :p"
11/11/2010,"it's a good bit, yes, but also it's an active module which means it uses capacitor and a mid slot. that means having something else turned off; ie, your warp scrambler, webber, afterburner, etc. that also means having 1 less module, such as a shield booster, extender, invuln field, etc. toss on an afterburner and with the proposed penalty for doing that you'd be easier to hit as well. i also said it should be equal to ""about 2"" inertia stabilizers.and yes, it actually says that it is basically an active version of inertia stabilizers... did you even read the original post?i don't believe it should have a stacking penalty with inertia stabilizers. if you want to sacrifice all your slots to aligning fast then so be it. you'll have almost no offensive/defensive power and will be targeted quite quickly in most ships as a result so... yeah. no different than putting a ton of speed mods to run away. yes, you can run away easier, but in the event you are caught and pinned down you die fast. it doesn't come without a price.regardless, as i said in the third reply made to this thread, the actual balance of the module should be left up to ccp. it would require extensive testing on the test server to see what the actual effects would be on the game and to choose a value that is high enough to be worth the cap cost and penalties, but low enough to not be insane."
11/11/2010,should use as much power as an afterburner with the same cycle time as a mwd making it vulnerable to neuts.
11/11/2010,"ill admit i'm not thrilled with the idea myself. but i do see how this is an obvious business decision that doesn't ruin the game. i'm supporting because they are allowing people to do this with plex and not just a direct money payment to ccp. i find it unlikely that i will use this feature myself but i probably would have when i first started. i hope ccp continues to make any microtransactions available through plex as opposed to direct ""cash only."""

11/11/2010,yeah fix the omen!
11/11/2010,"locked, no content."
11/11/2010,"the idea is rather simple. if you deal with contracts a lot and usually the same items this can be very useful. you usually have different settings for every search, for example when i look at caldari navy ballistic control system market i put 70mil as minimum price, to get rid of all pesky buy orders, and i limit the search to the forge region. it quickly becomes tiresome when you for every search have to change region, minimum price, search phrase and sometimes more. why not give us the ability to save search profiles with complete settings for the item we wish to search for?"
11/11/2010,"as a market trade alt, i support this!let us market warriors have our 'contract fittings'!i could reduce the number of sticky notes i have with settings listed on them for different items"
11/11/2010,a lvl 5 skill of our choice would be nice
11/11/2010,"a nice gift of say 1m sp would be awesome.for all chars on an account, not just the one with the most sp's. or atleast make it something you can put in the redeemable items so you can choose which character to put it on, not have ccp pick it for us."

11/11/2010,add a new itemname:sansha communication jammer who can use it: sansha effect:when sansha invade a system they deploy a communication jammer and the local chat channel is disabled
11/11/2010,"i won't be an asshat to the original op about this, but rigs are integrated into the ship which is why they can't be removed after placement. if the ship goes up, the rigs would go with it."
11/11/2010,lol. no.
11/11/2010,"i'm surprised to not see more support for something so useful, easy to implement and without a downside."
11/11/2010,"the sin is, in fact, terribly balanced when compared to the other bops ships.its actually just more effective to pack the high slots with large autocannons and neuts than anything else"
11/11/2010,my point exactly.
11/11/2010,"in current form absolutely not.as a carrier/ super carrier mod with 10 min cycle requiring fuel with the negative of the triage module but none of the bonus' of it ( no warp, no jump, no drones, no fighters, no bombers)........maybe. not likely but maybe.as for skills i would say a minimum of the following.electronic warefare vcyno field v+ new skill to slightly reduce fuel cost per level."
11/11/2010,obvious troll alt is obvious...
11/11/2010,"oh, and for the claim that server stability shows us when something is a ""blob""... so although neither crashed the node, the smaller fleets were more of a burden than the larger fleets. go figure. it seems to be part of a trend, but i'm not sure if it's increasing or not... essentially there are a few, very very vocal folks, who have been outmatched by numbers and/or superior firepower, and believe that the best way to deal with it is to have ccp directly intervene to protect them. hotdropped? nerf cynos, lowsec cynos, or titan bridging. outnumbered? nerf standings, fleet sizes, or the overview. and so on, and so on. it's... weird. especially since most of those whines come pre-packed with the ""blob"" snarl word as as some of argument winner. ""what do you mean that if they have twice my numbers i can either adapt, bring equal or greater numbers, or i'll probably lose? what are you, some kind of blobby mcbloberson blobermatic!?!?"" it's like we're being invaded by people raised on world of warcraft, people who simply do not get eve, at all."
11/11/2010,"in every game where territorial control counts, if diplomacy is left alone, the game is going to become a bipolar world. game designer can contrast this fate in some way, with world shaping, or more stringent rules of player movement. it is possible, in principle, to change gameplay in order to prevent a ""north vs south"" scenario. in eve it would possibly require too big of a change. changes in world shaping, nerf of capital mobility, more and more nerfing... and after these things the game may be the same. the game would be more boring, logistics will be more difficult, there would be less pew pew. in the end, i'm perfectly fine with the ""us vs them"", ""north vs south"" scenario. this is the political landscape that can fire the spark for huge and epic wars, that everybody would like if the package hardware+software+gameplay were able to handle it. small gangs and solo players have lowsec, empire and wormholes to play with. but in my opinion, small entities should have the ability to live in 0.0 hiding under the radar, with their logistic and industry, without being a threat to bigger forces. like smugglers, like pirates.right now living in nullsec conquerable requires at least a pos, and blue standings. the least object you can own in space has 10mil ehp, reinforce timers, and requires a lot of resources or money to work. that is, it costs a lot to own these things, but you also get a lot. why can't we scale down costs and effectivity, replacing defence with stealthiness and little costs? once i had an idea about this, that would not interfere with territorial warfare but could add a nice slice of gameplay."
11/11/2010,"god statistics **** is best ****.i would love to know so many things:statistics relating to account retention relating to age of accountvalue of assets on inactive accounts (also any t2 bpos, how many inactive acct titans and scs etc)how many accounts registered in the first month of the game are still active (and how many were registered total in that month).how many ship deaths (excluding pods, rookie ships, shuttles) there are to npcs, and to players, each day in eve.how many suicide ganks there have been in highsecwhat the least used ships arewhat the least used (t2) modules arewhich 0.0 region has the most been mined from, which has the most been made in npc bounties from?moon mins statisticshow many chars are currently in wormholes. how many ships. how many poss?what proportion of players regularly run high security level 4 missions?how accounts break down irl geographically?how much mins are produced from recycling compared to mining?what is the most used ship in pvp?how many t3s? most common configuration?i could go on all day!if dr eijo did a devblog full of delicious statistics (or a qen), he would get a lot of love."

11/11/2010,i can confirm that anything regarding stats will not happen anytime soon :p csm is still waiting for some data we asked for in 2006.
11/11/2010,"according to the tyrannis credits, research and statistics is a ten person department made up of eight researchers and two internal affairs overseers. they should have plenty of available manpower and oversight in that department, so why so much delay? what's taking up research and statistic's time?"
11/11/2010,"because there's not much we can tell you about specific proposals (either due to nda or because there's simply not much to say). issues that have been approved by the csm and ccp have gone into the development backlog. the fact that they havent been implemented yet is because so far other things have taken priority when it comes to development time. i want to avoid the whole roundtable to digress in 2 hours of players asking ""what about issue x"" and us answering ""it's in the backlog"". similarly, using the roundtable to say ""hey i have an idea, can you guys bring it to ccp?"" will only get you the answer of ""we'll look at it after the roundtable"".to get answers to questions like that, its more effective to contact delegates directly (outside meetings). it's ok, we don't bite ;)instead, focus on the general process. is the csm delivering what you, the player, expect from it? are we giving players enough information and do you feel represented? if there are problems and people feel certain areas of the process should be improved, how can we do that? also, if there are major issues in eve that we need to discuss with ccp that have escaped our attention so far? my hope is that after this roundtable we have a better view on what we are doing right, and what could be improved (and how)."
11/11/2010,"i was 4th last time.i was brainstorming myself on how the eve poker tourmnament can be improved.* at fanfest 2009 it was unlimited rebuys the first hour, all real money was for charity.** i would suggest some inprovements.in iceland it's illegal to play poker / pokertournament with real money and prizes, charity poker is allowed.the winners got a medali would suggest the following for eve fanfest 2011 pokertournament.administration fee: 2000 iceland kroner, this money will go to charity.buy in: 5 billion isk (eve money), 1 rebuy of 5 billion isk and an add-on of 5 billion isk. (5 is just a number)i guess you won't break icelandic laws when you can win in-game money :) now there are 2 options:the isks will be used for plex/ charity, and if so, ccp will hand out prices like unique ships, items, blueprint etc.or just have the isks as the poker prizepool so the winner can take a 250 billion isk prize home.the end word will be for ccp, they need to like and adapt the idea/concept.final words: i really enjoyed fanfest poker and it was good for charity, alot of money was collected.it was however kind of pointles poker as there was no prize at start, last minute 3 medals were called in.pete mckay was an awesome pitboss!edit:ccp could make the poker even more fun to put bounties on csm and ccp pokerplayers in case a player was able to knock the csm or ccp player out of the tournament. bounties can be ships and ship items."

11/11/2010,"i'd say low sec is the a good fusion between low income of high sec and low security of null, in so far it can be considered to be the hardest and most deadly environment for players and corporations out there.in a way it is ""the worst of both worlds"", a place never to be assimilated by high sec or null sec way of live.in so far thinking of worsening it might eventually give a good suggestion for ""improving"" it.okay enough with mad arrab like babbling.before anyone ask i'm a total carebear, so don't hope for too much pew pew suggestions.i've read some suggestions so far but i'd say although they sound good they are not very exciting, a lot of them are bit clich<U+FFFD> at the momentcriminal underworld (gangs online?)smuggling (infusion with stalker/privateer gameplay),pirate agents and pirate stations (burning seas in space fresh from the carribean is what ccp's vision has to be since 2003)low sec being borders between empires (can i get storm troopaz with blastaz then?)certain ships only buy able in low (good so while you drive around in your pimp machariel can i pimp my typhoon with paint?) so far the low sec suggestions seem to walkt three pathes turn it into a pseudo version of high sec just with better incometurn it into a pseudo null just without the hassle of politics and alliance land grabbingturn it into some place where players can play some game other than eveto be honest i've yet to realy see any suggestion that will work and give low sec any incentive to populate it.to be honest i've got no suggestion that won't do that also, and i don't think i can offer one but i'll try anyway."
11/11/2010,"the first question that has to be asked, how did low sec become low sec, not only game mechanic wise but also background wise, i won't say anything new anything exceptionally which hasn't been said before.game mechanic wise it is there to provide a training ground for small corporations and alliances to consolidate before moving into null, a place that is a bit rougher then high sec, less save and gives players opportunity to learn new survival techniques.in so far it was a total success, players that can't stand low sec would most likely be a failure in null. and those who can stand low will quickly see hey it's better in null and move out, in so far low can also be considered a population filter.that worked as long as null wasn't too crowded and there was still a little bit of space to conquer, explore and exploit without too much politics to care about.null has evolved, when politics became a driving force null sec owners suddenly had a need to refill ranks quick, they couldn't wait for some arbitrary filter to provide them with forces, recruitment became head hunter job and the forum the filter, statistics and tables full of numbers replaced the need for some game zone that acts in some membrane like way, in a way the recruitment board has superseded low sec.background wise in eve where there is a multinational ultra powerful militaristic police force financially backed by the mayor empires through concord, meaning the direct enforcement directive, how can it be possible that a lawless space like low sec is even able to exist?the same way as in the real world, fiscal and political reasons.fiscal as having the direct enforcement directive established in a certain system will cost billions if not trillions a year, so a solar system that hardly provides a million a year in taxes and is not part of any trade route is hardly worth the monetary pressure.political as when concord is democratically controlled by all empires - it has forces in - then still vetoes, which no uno like organisation can really exist without, will not always but sometimes stop necessary decisions.low sec can be considered to be the hypocrisies of concord and ded, here both fail to control and ensure anything not out of inability rather due to the very nature that both are made of.the grinding machine of the amarrian expansion would be put to a screeching halt through inner circle diplomatics yet in the same way increasing security of some fringe system of conflicting political interest will be vetoed if it hasn't been already curtailed to the same screeching halt.although i doubt any of my conclusions are the same one ccp came to when they designed low sec and you can be sure i came to the totally wrong ones some possible conclusion can be made about low sec:ccp has tried to manipulate this filter by lowering the income in low sec and thus create a push towards null, in so far they have turned a wheel on a mechanism that has slowly but steadily been replaced through tools provided by the community. in the same way changing income, establishing some totally new market or some game mechanic that doesn't exist outside of low sec won't necessary increase it's population.storywise the introduction of some pirate agents and bounty hunter guilds that only exist there might be clich<U+FFFD> and eventually look less like an interesting new story development and more like some b-movie. if it fails then it would be better to not fail in some obvious way cause it sucks rather end up a worse failure as twisted ending of some other story development.if carebear is about doing what you know you already have won, and pvper about knowing what does hold a possible win, lowsec has to provide more of both and at the same time make it harder to have any of the two  and that didn't work in the past, doesn't work currently and will most like not work in the future either."
11/11/2010,"so any visions of my own? hmm no not realy well so far i got a idea that doesn't need much new game mechanic just mostly using existing ones however doubt it is going to be established_personally an idea of limited control over a system and a limited ability to increase the profit is most likely something that would move lowsec again in the direction of being a training ground for current day null.and a right for the controlling group to shoot first and answer questions later without having to deal with security hit would give the system a slight might makes right feeling of null without making it entirely null.however each of the pathes would mean that something is gained but something else stays at the typical low sec space levelfor the possibilities to increase the profit that might be in three directions in form of higher paying agent missions (better payment, better lp given out)in form of higher amount space resources (better ores and drops)in form of higher amount of planetary and moon production for the controlling faction it should only be possible to achieve either the maximum for two and sacrifice one of them. a suggestion what three extreme combinations might be and what they mean:for higher paying agent missions and higher amount of space resources you have seen the light of police intervention and help. though the system is far from safe all pod pilots will find here a place where they can ensure a reasonable living standard to deal with the harshness of low sec space. agents provide a lot of money for various pod pilots, those support a industrial backbone that helps to bring in money necessary to support a strong military backbone. just the population has not really started to move in here, maybe you should have considered increasing the standard of living for the average workforce, well neither you nor concord lives on those colonies. yet with each passing day it starts to become obvious that by cooperating with ded you might end up in a jurisdictional conflict. while sentries are buffed in the sector your right to shoot anyone decreases until you can shoot only those with negative five or worse security standing, while shooting anyone else will get you a security hit.for higher paying agent missions and higher amount of planetary and moon production the controlling faction would work with the aim of creating increasing the living standard of the simple worker the controlling corp stands for helping the local population and thus factionalism. sacrificing space based profit in order to help the non pod space based population. although now that you secured the system and the unwashed masses look up to you as a guiding light in such dark times where the government is far away you wallet is not as you will need to import a lot of resources for keeping this state, even worse secret services of other empires will have an eye on you and some day you might suddenly find yourself on the wrong end of the faction militia's weaponry.for higher amount of space resources and higher planetary and moon production the controlling faction would work in allegiance with profit. security of space is neither an interest nor savety of people working here, ruthless economical exploitation of the system is the main aim here. problem is you forget to repair the sentries and gleaming over all this numbers you forget to check the immigration of pirates starting to settle your system and no everyone is so in bliss of richness to even care about telling concord about their barges being mindlessly slaughtered by sociopathic pod pilots out for wantom destruction. system becomes more like null. security hit when killing another player decreases. sentries are less dangerous until becoming a mere joke."
11/11/2010,"corruption isn't a system, corruption is a state, a state means someone is in power, in so far power corrupts  in straight forward logic that is true, i'm not sure it is that simple. after all no one will be corrupted because there is money, however everyone can be corrupted because he wants or wishes for something.i don't think my idea is realy complete or usefull in the way i presented it, but it might be a possible way to give the carebear side some reason to get to low sec while not making it a pure carebear paradise."

11/12/2010,i think the biggest problem with hybrids are that there are no good mid range guns/ammo it you look at must small to mid sized gangs must are fitted to fight at 10-30km at that distance the hybrids are just no good: blasters cant hit and rails cant do damage compared to other weapon systems there can hit in that range.
11/12/2010,a proposal on hybrids i can generally agree with. altho i wonder if all the changes combined would be a bit too much.tds idea on reworking the hybrid ammo variation concept is very interesting indeed.
11/12/2010,"i agree hybrids could use some love. i like the idea of reworking the ammo, similar to what they did with projectile ammo. also hybrid ammo needs to be smaller."
11/12/2010,"i give support to pretty much any attempt to bring attention to hybrids. some thoughts on this proposal though.1. the ammo size isn't as much a problem for small and medium ships, but i can remember way too many times when my rokh ran out of ammo on pos bashes. large hybrid charges are ridiculously large.2. if ammo changes are used to boost hybrids similar to how projectiles were changed then i can agree with altering reload times. it's not really that important though.3. tracking is one of the many proposed changes for blasters. it makes sense, though i don't think it's going help blasters as much as most people hope.4. t2 ammo would probably be looked at if ammo changes are made. no big argument here.5 & 6. i don't like using some arbitrary number to try and dumb down this problem, even if it is derived from the turret damage formula. it's just trying to put too simple a face on too complex a problem.also, i wish people would stop suggesting shield penetration. why are you trying to fix one aspect of the game by demolishing another?"
11/12/2010,"ok guys, i got the solution....swap minmatar and gallente play styles. minmatar gets blasters so they can dodge around with their speed and shield tanks and apply wtf damage. let them keep their racial ewar with web's and tp's and such. give gallente projectiles but let them be the slow armor tanking race that they are. they can keep their racial ewar with long points and damps and stuff. it would be awesome. also gallente still get's drone boats. hell we fit auto's on most gallente ships anyway, how bout we give em a bonus for it? i dont care what you say, gallente is under powered. you can ***** stat's all day about dps, range, ehp and cap consumption but you cant deny that 90% of the ships you see are either non gallente or an ishtar/domi/myrm. proteus's are sweet but rather rare. blasters should be setup where you can disengage if you want to similar to how minmatar is setup. with close range projectile ships, you can either fight at range or go nano and get in close with the ability to disengage. close range hybrids dont offer you this choice because of the ships they are tied to. with minmatar getting hybrids, they can get in close and fight but can also dictate range if needed because of their high speed and shield tank. gallente wont be able to dictate range but their guns will be much more effective considering their ship attributes. you can justify it by saying some crap like ""gallente and minmatar are bff's now and like to tell each other their deepest darkest secrets regarding weapon bonus's or something"". i dont know, i dont care but fix something."
11/12/2010,ok guys i have the real solution!this topic has been posted several times before in the assembly hall. please read the sticky of hot topics of the assembly hall before posting repeated topics. there are two hybrid topics already floating around in there. one for rails and one for blasters. please post in those threads rather than making new topics.
11/12/2010,"support 1 damned right they should be smaller, and i don't care if projectiles got reduced to make up for carrying more ammo hybrids should be appropriately sized to make up for having to carry cap booster charges to keep them running.2. totally agree this would give hybrids the ability to more easily switch between pathetic but at least some damage at typical engagement ranges and facemelting but pathetically short range if we can rub hulls.i also think that the fitting reqs on blasters should be lowered significantly. gal ships have lower grid than any race other than caldari which happen to be the other race crippled by hybrids sucking and at least they get to use less grid hungry shield tanks rather than the insanely grid hungry active armor tanks that gal supposed to use.the fitting req's at the small level are just brutal and medium isn't much of an improvement. lasers got it pretty rough too and should probably be adjusted as well but that's a different subject. either that or bump the the fitting reqs on small and medium auto's to be more inline with the other short ranged weapons so that ac users have to chose between tank and gank like the other races do."

11/12/2010,"well for example you can ctrl a to select all items in containers, etc. makes it very easy for can flipping, so::lets say you do a ctrl and mouse cursor over a ship and click it, then you can target all ships of that type within range up to your ships max targets.or do a ctr shift and click on it on any ship within range and target all ships within range up to your ships max targets.instead of clicking on or ctrl clicking each one seperately. can ninjas already have an advantage, why not give all other pilots an advantage of speed targeting."
11/12/2010,"um.no. i choose my targets deliberately, and unless the game is going to be smart enough to pick them in the order i would, i'd never use the feature.besides which, if it targets all rifters, how do i tell it not to target my allies (assuming they are flying a rifter). just...no. half formed ideas belong in features and ideas so they can be refined before being brought to the assembly hall."
11/12/2010,"i also can't imagine ever using something like this.if you are actually piloting your ship, ""range"" can be many things.- is it your targeting range?- optimal range- some sweet spot in your falloff?- ships within range that are traversing/moving at a speed that you can hit?- the ship you are orbiting vs other ships in range?- how do you tell it to not target ships that are too close to you?just seems like it would be easier to hold down ctrl and click on the things you want to target in your overview like you can already than to use a clunky method like that. picking targets is not as cut and dry like selecting inventory items in a jetcan is."

11/12/2010,"cloak gameplay changes needed.1) cloaks should have a cycle timer. short enough to prevent me from afk cloaking, long enough to allow me to gain on a sniper ratter.2) a dedicated module/ship is needed to confirm if cloaker is even on grid with your fleet. no details needed to tell if friendly cloaker. that is organizational. sonar ping effect is mandatory. ship scanner mod readout is fine.3) boost black ops/recon fittings/bonus. there is now a counter to them. and if they are afk they cyno out, log out. recons need to be faster in cloaked mode.4) time to look at depth charging ships to actively hunt cloakers. cannot be gate camp friendly. like hic bubble reduces speed. a game of warmer, warmer, warmer, colder! based on the range to cloaker only. no angle lines, no arrows. limited range is a must. can have blobs of these gridding out a gate but unable to actually decloak for a blob. just get them closer and closer.these ships must have no mids. no interdict launchers, no drones. no tankability. they seek and run.5) none of this matters, ccp does not send this tactical data to the appropriate client...and god forbid that 2 invisible ships know where each other are, but a scanner can tell you if you are being watched. asking for ganged coverts to not uncloak each other is too much. the rest...that's just good design.[also remove gang member sigs from probe results please, we can warp to them at will.]that's the covert ops i dream of. dream on..until my dreams come true."

11/12/2010,"i propose that csm adjust its approach to communications with ccp. as i understand it, what's missing are organized, thorough position papers on hot topics under consideration by ccp. case in point: microtransactions. csm has solicited player thoughts on the topic and gathered wealth of feedback. it feels strongly about the issue. in its notes of meetings with ccp it is also clear that csm repeatedly stated its concerns about microtransactions, however, those concerns were stated in the course of face-to-face discussions with ccp when making a forceful, cohesive argument on the spot is difficult.therefore, i propose that csm add position papers to its array of means to communicate with ccp. here is how this would work: csm learns of a highly important issue (be it from players or from ccp). csm solicits player opinion on the issue.csm then prepares an educated, organized and forceful summary attempting to reasonably reflect player consensus on the issue. csm then submits this summary to ccp.benefits: this approach would (1) make csm's arguments to ccp forceful, raising their effectiveness, (2) educate players as to the core concerns of csm and other players, (3) create written accountability benchmarks against which csm could measure ccp's adjustments to the game (e.g. csm says microtransaction are bad for this and that reason and states so unequivocally in a position paper. ccp decides to ignore csm position and goes ahead with implementing microtransactions, bad things happen, csm now refers back to its position paper and says: ""see, we told you so in an unequivocal manner right here""). overtime, ccp would be compelled to pay attention to position papers because they leave nothing to misunderstanding and are good evidence of why ccp should heed player feedback."

11/12/2010,"recently it has came to my attention that people obviously want combat and are getting nervous about the huge amount of titans being deployed, this isnt a dig at it i am sure players are well aware all nullsec alliances favour super cap production and mass produce them.this proposal is to introduce monuments so rare, that if an alliance captures one, they will be allowed to anchor it within a system increasing bonuses to a specific alliance.the bonus will apply to one system and will affect one alliance only, it will increase speed, damage output, optimal range, falloff by 100% and all resists by 50% of everything associated with that alliance including starbases (while in that system)in order to anchor such a monument 4 artefacts must be claimed which will randomly spawn in nullsec which weight 10k m3once all artefacts are brought together they can then be assembled in a system, they must be assembled in space and require 24 hours to be complete.during the assembly the monument can be destroyed so it must be guarded, the monument will in effect have 1 million hit points and when destroyed will drop 4 artes, after it has finished being assembled it will have 5 million hit points and if destroyed will drop 4 artes, monuments can only affect alliances who own space in that systemthis is just an example of an idea similar to how war occurs in a different game, i have noticed that alliances (at least in that game) risk everything and i mean everything to claim such rare stuff, either because they dont want enemies to claim it or because they want it themselves.i feel if something like this was introduced where something of great value yet rare was obtainable people would fight over it, probably not a great example but im open to ideas :dthinking about it now i think the main reason people arent fighting is because theres nothing really to fight over, maybe this thread is best of in f&i"

11/13/2010,"i was thinking the same thing reading the first few pages. vectors or whatever the new information is ... should only be displayed on the player's ship and the locked targets to reduce clutter and let us very easily decide which ships we want to pay attention to. new info should also shown on any ship selected or hovered over in the overview, so you can check on distant ships or fleets, or even maintain ""eyes"" on a nearby ship if you get jammed or sensor damped.i agree that semi-cicles, dots or other shapes would not be as easy to read as a simple vector. we would have to mentally combine a dot (direction) with a semi-circle graph (magnitude) to visualize the vector in our minds, which is just as much work as we do currently. cut out that middle step and use vectors, much less overhead and very intuitive.currently, when using the tactical overview and hovering the mouse over a module such as a gun, webifier, ecm jammer etc ... there is a shaded sphere displaying optimal range of that module. in the new system, add an icon or sliding scale on your targets depicting tracking when you hover over your guns, or a percentage chance to land a jam when hovering over an ecm module, etc.glad to hear you're onboard with the idea, this might turn into something exceptional.-j"

11/13/2010,absolutely supported. i like the omen very much for its design and have tried using it several times in pvp. the only thing it can really do is kill frigates.

11/13/2010,"hm, your proposal, even if it improves the current situation, will still be a click-sink, some sort of pve thing against a bundle of dialog boxes and a stop watch.additionally there might be all kinds of implicit issues with the ui that may make it slow and bulgy - like checking if x slots can be assigned, if x blueprints and materials are available in the selected hangar, if x jobs can still be created by the player etc.as far as i understand it the problem is rather that you have to restart the job every time manually at all. if jobs could be configured to 'auto-restart' after completion until they run out of materials or research slots, that'd fix it, wouldn't it?"

11/13/2010,totally like it. ofc you need to add something for 0.0 as well there. how about one plex buys you total invulnerability for all your sov mods for a month?
11/13/2010,"tl;dr they have low pg and bad dps, they are broken, fix themlonger version:at first let me define what i mean when i say that some ship is broken. if ship a is made for specific role and it is bad for that role, therefore no one likes to fly it, then its broken.most (if not all) caldari gunboats are dedicated snipers. they receive bonuses for range, unlikely to other races, they do bad dps as a compensation. this concept looks nice on paper, maybe when bunch of guys were creating eve they thought that its an awesome idea, but.. its not. whole line of ships is broken by this wrong assumption. for some reason ccp thinks that having extra range is such a huge advantage that its worth to sacrifice .. everything else! caldari gunboats shoot further than other ships from the same class, but they are very slow, have limited pg, bad drone bay, bad dpstake moa as an example and compare it with rupture. moa is unable to fit full rack of 250-s while rupture can fit 720mm guns and still has power for 10mn ab. rupture does more dps, is faster, has decent drone bay, can choose damage types etc.. only advantage moa has is range. same goes with ferox, eagle, vulture. only rokh is ok. its not popular because of shield, but this is another topic really.so what is suggested fix?moa: 1. needs pg enough to fit 5 250mm railguns without any kind of powergrid boosting module2. needs 25 m^3 drone bayferox:1. it also needs pg boost. not as badly as moa, but still. 2. dps of ferox is miserable, 6 gun slots is not a huge upgrade from moas 5 slots. ferox really needs 7 turret slots (like brutix) or 8 high slots (like cyclone)eagle:1. to keep eagle in par with other sniper hac-s, it needs pg enough to fit full rack of 250mm rails and mwd. all other sniper hacs can do that, why cant eagle? munin can even fit 2 heavy missile launchers together with mwd. eagle actually has only 3 effective low slots, as long as a 1 low is always occupied with rcu.2. well, thats pretty much it. eagle may easily become op due to its huge range.vulture 1. seriously why would someone snipe in a command ship? there is no point in giving to vulture 2 range bonuses. swap one of them with rof/damage bonus.rokh is fine, but it will shine if railguns get fixed. and why does it have only 50m^3 drone bay? apoc is also a dedicated sniper but it has 75in addition to that i need to say that all caldari and gallente ships are affected by broken hybrids. for caldari, railgun fix is particularly important. rails really need damage modifier boost. this simple modification would make them actually usable."
11/13/2010,"signed.also, add another turret slot to the merlin. right now, it looks like it was designed by a minmatar saboteur who wanted to force all caldari gunboat pilots to waste some time training missile skills, while at the same time omitting any flexibility."

11/13/2010,a smelly way to put it but i do agree that at least the pos interface stuff is in dire need of a revamp
11/13/2010,the eos... it needs love.125 drone bandwidth ktnx.
11/13/2010,why it isn't a feild command ship?the astarte is the combat ship. if anything the eos needs a stronger tank. it is dmg you want the astarte is the one you want buffed.
11/13/2010,de-beastify ? de-4star-tify?hm ...
11/13/2010,"the eos should be a dps powerhouse like the vulture or the damnation right?the problem with the eos is the bad ganglinks, not the bad dps."
11/13/2010,"learning game mechanics helps. fleet command ships are there to use gang links to boost a fleet. missiles on a damnation, for example, are pretty much just for killmail whoring or annoying fast tackle. dps is gravy and it's the nerfs that have hit ewar in general that hurt the eos. boosting the eos by giving it better drones is a bit like boosting the hulk by giving it a laser capacitor bonus."
11/13/2010,"yes please :) i guess the link bonus needs changing, i for one welcome any changes to information warfare links which imo makes the eos ****"
11/13/2010,"one of these things is not like the others, one of these things just doesnt belong... can you tell which of these things is not like the others? by the time i finish my song?""command ships skill bonus: 10% bonus to armor hitpoints and 3% bonus to effectiveness of armored warfare links per level""""command ships skill bonus: 10% bonus to medium hybrid turret optimal range and 3% bonus to effectiveness of siege warfare links per level""""command ships skill bonus: 7.5% bonus to medium projectile turret tracking speed and 3% bonus to effectiveness of skirmish warfare links per level""""command ships skill bonus: +15 m3 extra drone bay space and 3% bonus to effectiveness of information warfare links per level""did you guess which thing was not like the others? did you guess which thing just doesnt belong?if you guessed the eos is more ******ed than the others, then you might not be as ******ed as the eos yourself."
11/13/2010,i've already made a thread about it that somehow didn't get noticedwhat is needed to fix it is to make all command ships get bonuses to all types of gang links so a eos can also use armor com links and get bonuses for itoh and yeah the eos probably needs its bonus changed thats true
11/13/2010,"even more terrible idea. but hey, sure, and next we make all bcs have the stats and bonuses of the drake, right? if ganglinks on the fleet command ship of your choice, i.e. eos, are so terribad, get a t3 cruiser and use the ganglinks there. not like t3s are slowly stealing the role of fleet command ships already anyway..."
11/13/2010,"ahh ye the ships too close, i hear ya on that, the other points? well i wasn't looking for anything complicated like that, just simply as i put it, but the too close ships, ye that cuould be a big plus as it would target ""all ships in range"" and u wouldnt have to ""manually"" click the ones too close.i guess im just not as coordinated as that, seems like alot going ont clicking ship after ship, once you get into the mix. i would much rather just bang multi target, ok those are in range, pick the guns (etc) for whatever targets. and if they are too close, i was not paying attention;.. i should have burned away a bit to kite em or whatever the case may be."
11/13/2010,"except directed at the speaker. there are far worthier threads to troll with far worthier attempts at it.anyway, on both points you bring up:1- random inventing is actually the most plausible way i can see ccp implementing it, as in you start research on blueprint x, and you have a 80% chance of blueprint y, 15% for blueprint z, and 5% for blueprint qq. not the most elegant way, but until they change how items work it's probably a reasonable solution once you iron out the specifics of what researches into what, and is a good way to quietly seed some new ships in a more natural way than is done now.2- ""defender"" roles are something i personally want to see, but defender missiles really can't be worked on until such a role is fleshed out to be more than one piece of ammo for one weapon system affecting only a small portion of enemy offensive capability.and there's nothing wrong with the idea of turning indys into war vessels from a realism standpoint. ""i have a big ship..hm, let's throw some armor on and add guns!"" i wouldn't have felt the need to say it if fail troll hadn't mentioned it, though."
11/13/2010,"to the quote: ?? did you even get what i was saying? to both replies: and i wasn't trying to troll defender missiles, just use em as an example, and ye i dont do r&d yet, just thought it was more specific than random like that."
11/13/2010,"you want an answer that will draw people to lowsec?use these ideas (+1 btw) - however, allow for the overlord of the section to be bribed for protection similar to concord in high sec. use the insurance policy-type interface at a pirate spaceport to buy some level of protection (i.e. 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.7, 0.9, and 1.0 level of security) that is only active in their controlled territory. just imagine a spawn of bad ass npcs you ratted for years coming to your rescue from a gank in lowsec because you bribed them for protection. the tears of pirates would never stop flowing as the bears delighted in the chaos. hey, empire pays for concord to keep the peace, why not make peace for hire in lowsec?i do like the ideas posted, but it's never going to work as long as there are epeen gank blobs looking for their next thrill at someones expense. as the great bear once said - i play the game to entertain myself, not to entertain you! fix that, and you will have a higher population in lowsec in no time flat!let's face it, there is only one law enforced section, and two lawless sections. i think it should be one law enforced section, one quasi enforced section, and one lawless section.i like the idea, so i will support it even if there are no changes to the security of players from gank squads."
11/13/2010,"support the general idea.generally support most of the individual ideas. not 7. unless entrances to lowsec are more diffuse. i don't like the idea of making gate camps better, i would like to see that sort of pvp heavily nerfed to be honest. doing stuff in lowsec should be dangerous, not so much traveling to lowsec in the first place.i would also like to see standings to factions/corps have a significant factor in the game, and most certainly including pirate factions. things like access to stations and their services."
11/13/2010,bumped as a reminder.
11/13/2010,the csm convinced ccp of the benefits of delaying the expansion for additional polishing and bug-fixing. and the mini-expansion which we get meantime is basically made up of csm-relayed featured. is this going to be a roundtable or a party ?!
11/13/2010,"whats meant by microtransactions? pay a dollar and get your cargohold filled with ammo? pay a dollar and get a bonus million skillpoints?i certainly hope thats not the case.sigh, i blame the wow sparklepony for this."
11/13/2010,"if it is strip-poker, people will just lose to me because they'll be desperate to stop me taking off clothes. that's an unfair advantage that i neither want nor need."
11/13/2010,"i've noticed that there's an imbalance when you look at races in terms of ships using a specific weapon system. caldari missile trained characters have very limited options when it comes to choosing a ship they want to fly. let's take a look at some stats:amarr - laser ships:- 1 assault ship- 2 battlecruisers- 3 battleships- 2 cruisers- 1 heavy assault shipminmatar - projectile ships:- 2 assault ships- 2 battlecruisers- 3 battleships (typhoon mixed with missiles)- 2 cruisers (rupture mixed with missiles)- 2 heavy assault shipscaldari - missile ships- 1 assault ship- 1 battlecruiser- 1 battleship- 1 cruiser- 1 heavy assault shipthe similar situation is with gallente hybrid ships, but gallente also use drones which you have to train no matter what race you fly plus you must have drone skills to fly any carrier (in other words, you'll have drones trained no matter what race you fly).furthermore, there is only one non-faction pvp viable ship in any race that use cruise missiles - raven; and only two that use torpedoes - typhoon and raven.caldari players that decide to specialize missiles as primary dps have a lot skills to train and too few ships to fly. the only option is to crosstrain to minmatar where they need to have decent gunnery skills too if they want to be ready for pvp, which requires too much time.i would like to see csm's opinion on this.thanks for your time."
11/13/2010,"you fail to realize that your approach is a bit too theorethical here, i'm afraid. for starters, the actual slots on a ship don't necessarily mean you will fit the module there.then there's ship bonuses...for example... amarr afs can both mount lasers, sure. alas, the vengeance get missile bonuses though, why the hell would you mount unbonused lasers thus? you'd be better off with acs.same with minmatar, sure, they got turret slots on both afs. but also launcher slots. ever heard of split high slots on minmatar ships?and that minmatar players have to train both missiles and projectiles due to the high slot allocation on many of their ships is totally negligible or what? get a grip.incessant caldari whine spotted..."
11/13/2010,"typical anti-caldari whine detected.anyway, assuming all weapon systems being equal but separate (lol), i would personally prefer a switch to the one main preferred weapon type for each race with a preferred secondary showing up on some ships, but not in near a majority as the caldari presently have. this would allow tweaking of the ships into more specialized roles, especially for the missile ships which rely mostly on the attributes of the nonguided and guided missile systems themselves to play in different styles, as opposed to the ships lending themselves to a specific style. arguably, the versatility of the missile boats is a bonus, so it's not so much a 'whine' as what i would personally prefer style-wise.and if it comes across that way, my opinion is not to say the off brand ships existing is a bad thing at all. relying on one bag of tricks has never worked and *all* ships using one weapon type would be unrealistic.signed, caldari missile specialist"
11/13/2010,"well, it's not theoretical if you take into account that caldari have one missile battlescruiser and one missile battleship - two most common ships used for pvp. even if you have high missile skills, you're still stuck with drake and raven. that makes game for caldari players monotonous.you got the point about afs. i wasn't looking at the details.yes, i know about split high slots on minmatar ships (mentioned rupture and typhoon in the op). but if you train large projectiles, you still at least have the choice between tempest and maelstrom until you get missiles trained. amarr have the full set of battleships as dedicated laser boats. even gallente have a short range and long range hybrid battleship variations (with hyperion not being that usefull, but still it's better than nothing)."
11/13/2010,crosstrain.
11/13/2010,"what you're basically asking is to spread the race/ship distinctions thin so that everyone gets what they want and homogenizes the ship pool to an extent that there are negligible differences between ships of the four empires. there's a fine distinction between balance and flavour. what you perceive as an imbalance describes a particular distaste for the flavour. balance will never be achieved in any game, but a dilution of flavour is sometimes made in the name of balance. if that happens, the long term game becomes blander.being limited to a few decent missile ship is fine for caldari. i see no issues there. expanding the ship options for missile specialists can only be done in 2 ways - introduction of new ships or radically changing the bonuses/slot layout for minmatar and khanid ships. the latter change is unacceptable as it amounts to a dilution of flavour (aka caldari ships will no longer be unique in terms of effectiveness when using missile wepons). you've got only one left."
11/13/2010,"yes, it is possible to crosstrain. i've been in the process myself, since despite having gripes about the status of the game i still do play it, and make the decisions to help play it the way i want. i never saw a disclaimer in the eve ads saying that balance was determined racewise by pve effectiveness vs pvp effectiveness, and for such a dedicated amount of training time saying that it's fine because you either got lucky with your choice, had a friend tell you ""min or gtfopvp"", or what have you doesn't mean ****.because the solution exists doesn't mean it's a good solution. assuming (yes, assuming) that the game can never be balanced is never a reason to avoid attempting to do so. if you can argue for the stat quo being more balanced than an option go ahead, but given most lolposters have such a misguided view of what being 'balanced' saying it can't be done is at best a ""loliwin"" statement.anyway, like i said, the two weapon technique the caldari seem to have taken on is versatile, if more demanding skill wise. the issue is represented best (to me) by ships like the merlin. the shield resist bonus is weapon neutral and awesome, no argument there. then you pair it with a bonus that by its very nature doesn't effect half of the weapons it can equip. then there's the lack of modules that cross the missile-gun barrier for improving effect, and you get a ship that will never quite make up for that problem, even if it makes a valiant effort.tl;dr - ""crosstrain"" isn't an answer. people forget that just because it is technically possible to learn all the skills, the time spent in skills that are designed for the same purpose (piloting + combat) should have similar effect. equal time in racial piloting + equal time in weaponry skills *should* equal at least a reasonably equivalent amount of effective ships you can fly for both pvp and pve."
11/13/2010,"dominion, touted so much, but failed to deliver any but the most basic things. ccp seems to get the major stuff out the door, and never look back on any of their expansions. all that little stuff that was cut, and left on the dev room floor, would have made dominion ""excelent."" ""if wishes were horses, we'd all be eating steak."" jane cob.well ccp keeps wishing, but there ain't any steak on our plates, yet."
11/13/2010,"i'm not a ""bitter vet"", but i can see that this will end badly."
11/13/2010,"jw, not sure if there were minutes published after csm1 summits, such as we have now. i did find this old dev blog of xhagen's that summarizes results of the first csm summit. looking over that blog and the associated comments thread, you can see how much csm has evolved since then--in quite a lot of ways. and how it hasn't, at least in some players' minds, lol!"

11/14/2010,"not supported. suicide ganking is as valid a reason as ""legitimate"" pvp to lose a ship (based on the idea of keeping this as a sandbox), and should not be penalized any more than other ship loss."

11/14/2010,no
11/14/2010,"no, hell no! putting microtransactions in eve will ****ing destroy the game!"
11/14/2010,"ccp fix blaster range, it's been a huge problem for gallente pilots for years..."
11/14/2010,"no no no. the problem is tracking, not range. up the tracking so that we can hit at the shorter distances we fight within. extending the range would just make blaster even more like pulse lasers."
11/14/2010,it will blur weapon difference.blaster needs:more trackingoptimal + falloff is the shortest in the game. why is it challenge to hit an appropriate target at native range? small dps boostdps advantage should correspond with range disadvantage. pulses shoot 85% of blaster dps at 300% blaster range - it is not fair (comparing null vs scorch and barrage ammo difference is more insane). small dps boost is needed to compensate approaching time where a blaster boat gets damage without counterattack. more agility for gallente ships gallente boats tank armor - it means ships are penalized with speed and agility.gallente boats are blaster boats - it means they must approach as quick as possible at their tiny optimal range.but these two sentences contradict to each other. ok fastest ships are minmatar ships. lets give some agility (not speed) to gallente boats to move fast linearly.
11/14/2010,"make stations like t3s where you can choose which modules you want and thus altering the appearance? i support this though, instead of just changing the colour scheme small details should be added. a kronos shoulnd't just have a lighter hue of brown than the megathron, it should have a bulkier hull and some stasis webifier extension."

11/14/2010,"so let me get this straight. if you pay x number of plex (bought with real money) for a ship it should never be destructible... ? if thats how microtransations work i will be rofling till the cows come home. drop $100 on a (insert bad ass ship/fitment here) and go hunt titans in my indestructible ship. yea thats a great game mechanic. thats like a duel were if one cowboy pays $x amount of money the other guy is given a gun that has blanks in it. if modules are also indestructible does that mean i can over heat forever?so what happens when me in my indestructible ship attempts to blow up your indestructible ship? i would like to know. do we just sit there shooting till we run out of ammo? what are your thoughts on this?you say that you want an edge over the other players. you also go on to say that the ""other players are not that serious about the game."" im sure anyone that pays $15 a month for a game is serious about it. thats $180 a year for a game. what youre saying is that you want the ability to pay more then the other gamers to get an edge over them. why would someone continue to play a game that they now have to spend hundreds or even thousands of real life currency to stay competitive? thats on top of the $15 monthly fee they/we all ready play. you lol about how he is trying to tell ccp how to run there company. you need to step back and look at ccp as a company. right now the only game ccp has out on the market is eve online. if eve online does not make them enough money to pay there bills ccp will fail as a company and close its doors. who is paying ccp the money they need to keep making there bills every month, we do. as paying customers for eve online we are keeping ccp open. if ccp is thinking of rolling out a game mechanic in there only game that could potently make most of the player base quit said game i think he(we) has(have) every right as (a) paying customer(s) to suggest to ccp what he(we) thinks is a safe way of going about it. kind of like letting ccp know that if you do it this way, we might not quit your game because of it. if mt is implemented the way you want them to be i hope you will have fun flying in empty space. you wont have much to shoot at after that update. edit: added my support for this great set of guidelines. they should act as safety hooks for the slippery slop we just walked out onto."
11/14/2010,"yes there will still be a fair amount of clicking. however i hope to lessen the click-fest and bring the industry process more inline with the amount of effort required to do other tasks like: fitting a ship, creating a contract, etc.i'm not sure i see what you do. each of the checks you mention already happen, and either succeed or fail gracefully. the goal is to eliminate running these checks two, five, or ten times individually, and only running them once as a whole. think about how we can group turret slots in combat. there is only one ""stack"" of guns for the server to calculate and think about. lets treat industry jobs in a similar fashion.this would be great, and i completely agree. the only consideration is that almost every public industry slot would be occupied for much longer time periods, and reducing the chances that slot can be turned over to another player. however this option would be perfect on a pos as those industry slots are private by nature."
11/14/2010,"i like it, original post updated with the idea.thanks for the feedback, keep it coming! this is already sounding better than when it started."
11/14/2010,"+1, in loving memory of all small, reasonable, yet gamechanging features you'd expect in a polished, finished game."
11/14/2010,hi guys! if you really support this proposal we have a november 2010 prioritization crowdsourcing here is the wiki list ->> list and here is the the thread ->> thread and according to the wiki learning skills is at 113. enter a list of proposals that the csm should prioritize.
11/14/2010,not supported. solution looking for a problem.
11/14/2010,how about giving freighters/indies a percent increase of armor/shield rep amount per level?
11/14/2010,failing at trolling and not realizing the tactical difference it makes to be able to prevent a portion of damage as opposed to having to apply a heal after it hits? -2
11/14/2010,"additional failing note: adding a stupid idea into another and then trailing of wiht your own degenerating idea does not show a high iq level. this idea has nothing to do with damage reduction , simply damage redirection. the ability to use your ship as a living..... sort of shield to protect another less ehp gifted ship."
11/14/2010,"or, you could just stop failing and use a blockade runner/jump freighter to get in with no need for an escort, or use webs and ecm to clear tackle and web into warp, or use tanked haulers, especially deep space transports, and logistics plus maybe a bit of ew to keep them alive. there are plenty of options out there, if you fail to use them, a skirmish fleet should be able to take out your weak valueable haulers and then gtfo."
11/14/2010,no
11/14/2010,"nevermind all the rude replies you got, i will try to be a bit constructive about it.a mechanic like this would break the wardec system altogether. one of the largest (if not the largest) reasons people wardecc each other is to be able to pvp in empire space. offering a mechanic to bypass that would, imho, plainly make wardecs meaningless. what would be the point of deccing if your target can only take up a collection from its members (and it is only about 6 mil per skull in a 60 man corp, which is nothing at all for most players), and virtually kill the dec for a month? i am sorry, i see your point, but this will not add anything of substance to the game."
11/14/2010,just give them lasers?
11/14/2010,it's impossible to find any use for most caldari gunboats.. except eagle and rokh
11/14/2010,i approve
11/14/2010,my ferox wants a word with you.but it wants a small pg buff even more. supported.
11/14/2010,"i think most of these problems would be solved if rails didn't suck so hard, but at the same time i'm a pretty much pure caldari pilot on one of my accounts and it's a terrible problem that we have 1 missile battleship, 1 missile battlecruiser, 1 missile cruiser, and however many frigates it is that use missiles, and caldari's the missile-centric race. and the hybrid ships that the caldari do have are pretty pathetic.edit: forgot to click support the first time around."
11/14/2010,the real problem with caldari gunboats is that hybrids are easily the worst weapon systems in eve.edit: and lack of powergrid.
11/14/2010,pretty much this.
11/14/2010,"towards 1) - because they still sell in quantities and if they were totally broken they wouldn't. take a look at market logs in jita e.g. apart from this rather simplistic answer... bonuses and role is ""working as intended"", the main issue is really the general problem with hybrid weapons systems, not the ships itself. have to agree there with the goonie a couple posts prior.towards 2) - that may be your opinion. alas, before you can prove that all caldari gunboats are in fact ""bad"" and it is not more of a weapons system issue, that is a non-argument. apart from even a terrible ship adding variety, just not the one you would prefer. ""variety"" is by no means tied to ""quality"" or ""performance"", sorry. think you got your semantics wrong there.towards 3) - so all the sales of their hulls are solely for reprocessing and insurance fraud? i don't think so...tl:dr - terrible idea tweaking caldari gunboats to compensate for issues with hybrid guns. best way to throw the whole balance even more out of the window. how about you focus more energy on rebalancing hybrids instead?"
11/14/2010,"even if medium/large hybrids were super awesome, most caldari gunboats would still be crippled and near-unfittable."
11/14/2010,"this. bad tracking, bad dps, uses cap, uses ammo, extremely onerous fitting requirement weapon system plus low grid ships = fail."
11/14/2010,"i updated the first post with the two proposals so far. feel free to comment on them, etc etc."
11/14/2010,"november 2010 prioritization crowdsourcing (csm) list contains lots of duplicate proposals and the votes are spread across different ids for the same issues/proposals.just a few non-exhausting examples:#22 / #23 blackops improvements / blackops improvements part 2 (same proposal / different csms?)#51 / #52 drone implants / drone improvements#40 / #154 corporation bookmarks / shared corporation bookmarksdear csm members, imho you should do something to merge / bundle the duplicates, so the votes are not being wasted!"
11/14/2010,"i think that directors, ceos and fcs should be able to have a different color of chat in a given chat window appropriate to the task at hand, i.e. such as fleet and corp channels, etc."
11/14/2010,colored chat in the wrong place can lead to things like this.see what i did thur?
11/14/2010,"totally supported. i'd also like customizeable paint schemes for ships so i can have a ""hello kitty"" marauder paint job to go along with my pink chat lines..."
11/14/2010,"this. also i would like to be able to set things so that your own text appears different to all other chat text but only on your client. finally, contact chat looks different from non contact chat."
11/14/2010,"this thread is pretty funny considering players can already chat in colour, no idea how it is done nor do i care, but i have seen normal players do this many many times, so im thinking its an exploit.just checked my convo logs and funny enough they showed nothing not supporting since whats the point, you will only get morons typing in really **** colours *cough* double dee *cough*"
11/14/2010,"now that incursion testing is underway thanks to the latest patch and news that the proper expeansion will come out fully in january some thought should be taken into account of the test cycle so to speak of incarna. since this will be one of the most major ""changes"" to eve online since its launch. (even though as ccp has said this will not change so much as the core eve gameplay..as providing a more personal aspect into the game).ccp has made no plans or annoucements reguarding testing for incarna but i just would like to be the first to propose, since you are a bridge between the players and ccp, to encourage ccp to make a longer test cycle of incarna then any previous addon to date. even if the first ""test builds"" for sisi is buggythis would make the long term players have a better chance at providing real feedback and suggestions and as the latest email sent to players who have not been active in the past few months, more effect could be made into making more players aware of the tests (as i think there still may be a number of eve online players who do not yet realize that features of incursions are available to test now) it just seems in my opinion that incarna will benefit the most from player testing and player feedback and i hope that you would recommend to ccp to bring incarna to sisi as soon as possible (even if its in a half finished state at first) just to give exposure to it and allow us to feel like we have input into it too!expecally considering that some of us have been waiting to try it out since 2008 :-)thanks!"
11/14/2010,"came expecting a thinly veiled attempt to delay incarna, left pleasantly suprised."
11/14/2010,"incarna has no interaction with the game beyond avatars and rp elements. why does a graphical chat system require ""testing"""
11/14/2010,"i fully support this; however, the longest test period will only happen when it goes live.patch the patch anyone?"
11/14/2010,"well, if things were perfect that would not be necessary because ccp did strenuous qa before deployment of each patch/expansion. as we all know, that is not exactly happening. so yeah, supporting this, even if i won't put my hopes too high it will actually lead to anything. i seriously hope that will not lead to being spammed about beta-testing stuff i could care less about. fine with me if people want to spend the playtime they paid for on sisi, i don't care. i would most likely start to care in a negative way if any kind of pressure or even regular spam to play unpaid qa for ccp would be applied. ccp doesn't want to hire people to properly test new stuff and instead uses sisi for that - fine, their call.i don't want to be bothered with playtesting stuff i might not even be remotely interested in - leave me alone with that, my call."
11/14/2010,yes
11/14/2010,hey..not true! jump clones are real.err....eh...
11/14/2010,i've got to admit to being pleasantly surprised by that reply. damn.
11/14/2010,"i still don't see how you think a gauss gun is not hybrid. just because it's not a 'rail gun' does not mean it's not a hybrid. it's probably one of the closer associations to a hybrid-type that the game has. hot all hybrids 'need' to be a rail gun. they are hybrid because their charge group is in the ammunition, and the energy is provided by the weapon. not supported."
11/14/2010,the original purpose of plexes was to make buying time with isk easier for more people. as they are right now they are like everything else in the game adn easily manipulated. i really dont think you should be able to flip them because it artificially inflates the price and that means less players can use then thus affecting the playerbase and ccp's bottome line.my proposal to fix this is to make a patch so that when a plex is sold it is automatically applied to your account. this makes it forfill its intended purpose without screwing over peopel who have like 500 of them sitting in thier hanger. this would be good for both the players that use them (which was what was intended) and ccp.
11/14/2010,"basic economics proves your premise unsound.higher price = more incentive for people to buy plex to sell for isk. the more people who buy plex and want to sell it, the lower the price will be.also, this is eve. pvp doesn't just involve shooting stuff."
11/14/2010,"i have 4 accounts, but only a single char in jita/any other hub. i use that single char to buy 4 plexes and contract them out to my alts on other accounts. your system would give me 4 months on 1 account rather then 1 month on each of my 4."
11/14/2010,"it also defeats the primary purpose of the plex - providing game time for people who don't want to/can't pay with real money.if i can buy a plex, i obviously don't need to use it purchase game time, since the plex (at least in usd) is more expensive than just paying for my account.next stupid idea?"
11/14/2010,"buy low, sell high?if you get your way, then the market would be gone for making a profit in plex. no."
11/14/2010,"this is a really neat idea.as others have said, if it has the caveat of being able to show/hide on the overview, then i fully support this."
11/14/2010,yes
11/14/2010,"i'm sure this has been proposed before, but i am too lazy to find the thread....i get tired of having to go to a pos to see how much fuel is in it... what i am proposing is that there be a new feature implemented into the assets page of the corporation window that allows you to see the fuel levels in your corp's pos's that are up. currently, my corp has a few pos's up, all very far from eachother and that makes it hard to check the fuel levels on them efficiently. it doesn't have to be anything fancy, just the exact same page as what it shows in the pos management window at the actual tower. should be something simple to do.."
11/14/2010,yum
11/14/2010,i've always thought local chat was detrimental to the true tactical potential of pvp in eve. i think this would be a step in the right direction.
11/14/2010,"you do know that the local channel is technicaly created by the gates as your ship contacts them when it enters system( somethign along that lore) the current argument that removing local is both good for pirates as well as carebears is a load of bull. as it is a none pvp ships only defence is knowning 3-5 seconds before the hostile can get on grid that hes in system. so unless your ok with giving the indys tank equal to or greater than there size counter parts no.additionaly the ""if you dont know that theres a cloaker in system it cant hurt you"" also fails as it adds another layer of security to cloaked ships as they dont show up on dscan and untill it hot drops a sc fleet on your head you wouldnt even know it entered system ( over powered much)"
11/14/2010,"i had reservations supporting this, because it gave sov holders a means of keeping local. but after reading mchief117's response he's persuaded me to lend my support to this proposal."
11/14/2010,"well even if they make roids colidable objects (which i think they are) the combat system will mean nothing, solid or not will get in the way of shots regardless of where and when you move between those objects.changing the combat system so its a dynamic hit detection based will melt the ccp servers and prior to that induce sooo much lag that people will emoragequit right left and centre. maybe, one day in the future.... hmmm....no, what im talking about is planets, moons and possibly, just possibly, gates and stations. so when u enter warp and traverse through to your destination you dont 'noclip' through objects long enough to notice that uve done so.even inducing an effect when u go through something would be enough bt god the whole moving through an object like you're in a 3d modeling program or 'nocliping' on a fps game reeks of sloppy game design and an unfinished and un-thought out game mechanic."
11/14/2010,empty quotin'
11/14/2010,"anyone who considers themselves to be any better or smarter than the rest of the community because they have ""figured out blobs win this game"" are either bat**** insane or misguided.the issue has and never will have anything to do with winning eve.as a video game the priority off the developers (and the community - irony) to maintain a relatively fun environment.the issue with large scale warefare is that the novelty of it wears of rapidly. sure eve is unique in that how many other games give you an instance where 4000 other people are fighting the same battle, but lets face it these battles are not playable and the influence of individual players on them is negligable.im not saying nor is anyone else i believe saying remove blob warefare! i think the stance people are and should be taking is ""yo lets not encourage blob warefare any more than it already is by human nature"" these make belief added bonuses to naping gigantic coalitions only make things far worse in day to day gameplay and when wars kick up(and half of eve turns up to the same system to watch a loading screen).as a game this should not be exclusively trying to mimic rl or provide insentives for people to waste their lives doing things they dispise (see seiging towers etc)it should promote an environment where individual players have a real and substantial influence on the game, preferably more regularly than they do now. it should also promote a style of play that the servers will be able to handle and sustain with growth.above all it should promote a style of play which is fun.edit: clinging to a model of this game that is inherently not fun because you think you have figured out something that everyone else is yet to... is pretty silly, because you are assuming everyone is satisfied being bored out of their minds so long as they are winning."
11/14/2010,"thread cleaned of some off-topic posts and replies to trolls, please remain on topic."
11/14/2010,"folks can, of course, check eve search. ah well.here's a bit of a refresher, however.yet again, minigin is trying to pretend that tens of thousands of people have no idea that they're not really having fun (but he knows) and that the game they've been enjoying all this time isn't something that they're actually enjoying. evidently tens of thousands of people participate in ""blob"" warfare because they can't be trusted to make up their own minds as to what they enjoy or how they should play the game. as arguments against ""blobbing"" go, the ""i can read your thoughts and you're not really enjoying what you think you're enjoying!"" argument is, shall we say, unpersuasive. the standard troll response, at this point, is that anybody, anywhere, has said that lag/not loading grid/server weirdness is fun. it's a pretty good sign that your entire argument is completely bankrupt when you're reduced to arguing that you're doing all this for other people's benefits (who don't want your ""help"" or agree with you), that you know better than them what they enjoy and, more importantly, that your quest for ccp to alter how they are allowed to play the game is more valid than their simple ability to join large-scale combats or refuse to and only engage in small-scale combats. trying to rewrite reality is, likewise, not a valid argument against ""blob"" warfare. it is telling that minigin's argument against ""blobs"", already based on telling tens of thousands of people how they really want to be playing (if they stop listening to what they think they want and listen to what mini says they want), people now have to ignore that there are actual bonuses to having a larger team, while the 'make belief' bonuses like mutual defense and coordinated attack simply don't exist. screaming in all caps makes an argument goood!!!!!of course, it's almost like this is a game where a mass of multiple-players gather online and those who want to accomplish great things on their own must, who'd a thunk it, actually accomplish them. of course, rather than going down the ghsc path, or the haargoth path, or being a really great fc, maybe we should all be hoping that ccp will alter the game to help us.then again, i heard that in the near future some game developers are going to create some games that actually don't require a mass of multiple people to play them, and not even an internet connect. i think these may be called ""single player"" games, in which an individual player not only has an impact, but they're the sole driving force and they don't have to worry about not being significant despite them not doing anything that's significant.perhaps when these ""single player"" games come out, some people will no longer require the games with a mass of multiple-players who are online to let them have substantial influence even if they haven't figured out how to influence anything substantially.we can only wonder. there is a fundamental problem when someone's entire argument is based on mind-reading, a denial of reality and a claim that ccp should directly intervene in order to protect people who want to be able to achieve something in eve without actually being able to achieve anything on their own. the idea that ""blob"" warfare (remember, a content-free snarl word) has to be dealt with so that people who cannot achieve anything noteworthy as individuals can feel like they're impacting the game world simply misses the point. if you want to be able to impact the game world, you have to be able to impact the game world. asking ccp to help you is an absurdity. if folks want individual impact, and they're unable to impact the game as individuals, it's not ccp's fault, let alone groups cooperating."
11/14/2010,"let me ask you two questions first of which the answers i already know, then i will butcher the consistant and ridiculous thought pattern you have been using to seek to (not defend your own view or galvanize this game into a better one - which should be why you are posting on this forum - but instead to protect your own agenda)1. do you have any significant impact on the game you play? (would your coalition be any different at all without you?)2. what do you have fun doing in this game? (aside from mistaken feelings of pride)the problem with your reasoning finnagain is and always has been that you jump to conclusions far to quickly and seek to use invalid conclusions to support your agenda. in threads gone past your entire argument has been hinged on other people trolling you, being crybabbies to ccp or having serious mental illnesses. now these all may have negative connotations to you, but none of these actually disprove a well reasoned argument. simply restating them over and over will never change that.in this post you follow some of your previous processes, a mistake many people on the internet make, they believe the use of caps is ""screaming"", i wonder if you really are that convinsed that whenever someone types in caps they are sitting at their computer with veins popping at their heads yelling at you... surely this could not just be emphasis of an important point! you then seek to use your invalid conclusion of this to spin negative connotations (again not to do any real debate - just to discredit).ps if i had a dollar of every time you said ""yet again"" before leading into something i have explained about a dozen times and you keep using the same ridiculous argument for... i would have almost 50 bucks by now.one more time for the boat man i spose... i know you arnt having fun because i have been you! that is to say, i have been in the nc and i still have alts in the nc, so i hear you when you are complaining about the game, i hear you when you talk **** about ccp, i hear you threaten to quit the game if things dont improve.to me... it sounds like you guys are having loads of fun, so when i come here and say ""yo this isnt fun"" and am met but such fierce resistance that you are... i can totally understand why.pss. the fact that your only real examples of changing the game are through what has been heralded by popular thought as the most ******ed game mechanic in existance (insta disband of alliances at directors hands) makes me more worried that you really do want the game to be at a stage where the only changes can occur via such ridiculous means."
11/14/2010,"it's funny that you keep hammering on the point that what you're doing must be fun because it seems to me like you're trying to imply that everything else isn't. so silly of me but if that were true then something would be wrong also... whatever.my main argument against gigantic blob-hugs like the one that kept iron afloat for about 6 months too long is that when you blue up everyone for 100 jumps you aren't playing the game, you're having a gentleman's agreement not to. you're sitting in your little outposts in vale and tribute and tenal and whatever and you're sipping your tea, adjusting your top hat and telling all your friends how much fun you're having - 90% of the time - because there isn't a fleet going on and there's a hostile roaming gang outside your outpost. you two are too busy bleating about how much fun fleet warfare is when you're forgetting the obvious reverse, which is, when you only feel safe leaving home with 600 of your buddies, how often do you undock at all?"
11/14/2010,"btw the fact that so many of the csms got elected on promisses of looking into ""blob warefare"" (coalition issues/sov issues), i think its fair to say that this isnt a problem that a meer handfull of people are having.the real question i am here to ask isnt ""if this is a problem"" because it clearly is, but how csm plans to address this issue, or if they simply plan to let ccp ignore them and the playerbase that elected them."
11/14/2010,"i'll bite...methodology===========1) have you made any effort to aggregate accounts at the player level?2) have you made any effort to distinguish between mains and alts?3) have you made any effort to incorporate 1 and 2 into your stats? example: do you really think 11,000 toons fly kestrels as a 'combat ship'? no. 10,980 of those are cyno alts. how many of those 11,000 have cyno field theory trained? how many have their kestrel fit with a cyno lighter and ozone in the hold?i imagine you've made some effort in this regard for marketing/customer retention/subscriber acquisition, but you could put a lot more meat on the bones of your stats if you could break out alts and second/third+ accounts. you may have 300,000 subscriptions but you don't have 300,000 subscribers.4) given significant academic interest in virtual worlds, have you engaged in discussions with economics research departments at major universities, ideally with an eye towards enabling some sort of research projects?lastly, not to be a jerk about it, but i can't help but wonder5) of the 10 people on the research&stats team, how many play the game (read: log in 2-3x per week and actually do stuff)?bots/macros====1) how many accounts are logged in for >15 hours a day? >18? >20?2) how many toons have > 8.0 standing with these agents? of those, how many have < 5 million sp? <3 million? how many overlap with #1?3) what are the nullsec systems with the highest and/or most consistent bounty production? ore production?4) how many accounts per month are banned for botting/macroing? i'm not the first person in this thread to ask it, because the general suspicion is not many at all.gameplay data=====1) ships produced and destroyed, complete list. destroyed by players/rats.2) modules and rigs, as #1.3) or, perhaps, most common fits? i don't need you guys to run a query to tell me that the most common fit is going to be a drake with t2 sprs and a bcs or two. what's the most common arazu fit? muninn? i suspect there is a modal fit for higher-skilled ships.anyways, this is all i can think of for now."
11/14/2010,the trouble is you get statistical outliers like cyno alts and scout alts distorting the figures.
11/14/2010,this.
11/14/2010,i would like to knowhow many player starting to play with trial account per month?and how many of them deciding to pay and play?how many player paying with plex?
11/14/2010,"more like: wasting a plex to do an additional stat remap.at least thats what ccp was planing.btw.: regarding not able to tell stuff about the accepted proposals (by nda).... if i understand you correctly ccp censors the stuff the csm can tell the players by gag-ordering them, when they dislike what it would be?which kind of embarassing stuff would come out if they wouldn't?"
11/14/2010,"hybrid guns balance (csm)fix blasters (csm)hybrid guns balance csm meetingblasters 2.0maybe take a look at blasters....just saying. i know its not what your looking for but i can't make it the roundtable meeting to bring this up. if you guys would come up with a solution for this big problem that keeps being brought up i would very happy. saying us blaster boat pilots to learn another weapon type is not a solution like what the meeting minutes sugest. sorry but we expect more then that. the blaster 2.0 thread has 20 pages of ideas that would go along way to making blasters/hybrids weapons better. is it right that pluse lasers get 85% the damage but with 300% more range. yes they have worse tracking but they have longer ranges, thus not needing as much tracking. just take a look. most people arent looking for more range... there asking for more tracking. here is a quote from blasters 2.0 thread (page 20) that gives a good example of what people are saying in the thread and what there asking for. is it asking too much that this get brought up to ccp again? this effects many players of eve and needs to be looked at now. this needs to be kept in the spot light so that ccp knows that they need to look at this. this effects half of the races in eve! its not a small problem, its effecting 1000s of players in game. please spend some time on this. i would really like to see ccp gets this fixed by the summer expansion. this should have been fixed a long time ago... on a side note:thank you csm for your hard work on getting micro-transactions either out of the game for good or for cosmetics only. thats some bs that needs to be primaryed and killed."
11/14/2010,"no, ccp generally only imposes nda for features which haven't been announced, stuff that could be considered advantageous to competitors if it was public knowledge, proprietary corporate data (such as future plans or financial or legal data), and (most of the time) advance disclosure about which csm backlogged items are being worked on for a given patch. the latter is typically due to wanting to avoid player disappointment if a particular item doesn't make it in, since many factors impact the ability to achieve development goals. i am not in favor of this approach regarding status of csm backlogged items being worked; i think players should be told what's in the pipeline because i think they are smart enough to realize that saying that is not a promise, but a plan.ccp does not otherwise attempt to ""gag"" us from telling players things which would make ccp uncomfortable. if that were true, the june minutes or for that matter, the october minutes, blog posts, tweets, and forum posts from myself, teadaze, and a few others would not be nearly as critical or cuttingly analytical as some of them have been."
11/14/2010,"maybe you can remind them of the multiple threads in the assembly hall on microtransactions and get everyone to place their votes during your round table. there are over 1000 replies with peoples views.no plex for remapmicrotransactions - yes, no, cosmetic only?alsoguidelines for ccp to follow to not break the game even more after introducing mtscerbus"
11/14/2010,"umm... how exactly is this a feature? you bridge in a bunch of recons, covert t3s, and bombers to do what exactly? take down the cyno jammer? that's... not going to happen. cuz if you could beat the defenders with recons, you could just bullrush it with bss (which would be cheaper and kill the jammer faster). the whole jammer/cov cyno thing is kinda pointless when the ships you bridge in can't really do anything of consequence. so yes, it is an ignorable feature.in further commentary on your points about the bo jumping, fuel, and balance... you are forgetting the fact that bos have an atrociously poor jump range. it is truly terribad. that is drawback that balances out it's ""incredible"" ability of a subcap able to bridge and use both cynos and gates. having to have a hauler tag along is just too much. it's yet another anchor around the neck of bos. they shouldn't have to deal with that, the crap range is bad enough. (don't get me wrong. i'd love to see dreads and carriers need fuel ships too. but then i'd also like to see logistics be difficult again, and i think jump freighters were a terrible idea. but that is never gonna happen. so at least make it equal, and remove logistics hell from bos.)"
11/14/2010,"sure it is. each race has a combat profile for their ships, and that varies by race and by their ships. if you can fly all the ships in the game, you can choose what ships you want for what situation. there are going to be some ships that are crap, that's just the way the game works."
11/14/2010,"of course that i'm crosstrained and i will continue to crosstrain to other races. that's not the issue to eve junkie like myself. however, newish players that get into the game through pve mostly choose caldari missile ships. if you are new to the game and have missiles as primary dps, when you get into pvp you'll soon see that your possibilities are very limited and that you are basically stuck with drake/raven combination for at least couple of months. that could be discouraging for new players.don't get me wrong, drake and raven are relatively good in what they do, but as a dedicated missile pilot you are still stuck (most of the time) at looking at a drake or raven when you undock to get a fight, having 2 or 3 fits that are remotely viable and in drake's case no possibility of active tanking (like in every other race). simply said, you don't have choices like other races do.thanks for the responses so far. positive and negative."
11/14/2010,"i'll just comment on the above paragraph specifically. the statement ""a game can never be balanced"" does not imply leaving out the balancing exercise, nor does it imply that something is impossible to do. what it implies is that, as soon as you balance something, another imbalance pops out as players adapt to the new play rule and unexpected loopholes form. take a look at the eve mineral basket, t3 salvage and t2 moongoo scene. it clearly demonstrates the bottleneck effect no matter what sort of balance you apply to it; in the t2 scene with technetium replacing dysprosium/promethium. you will soon realize that it is a never ending chore. as such, balance hammer should be always be wielded cautiously and should only be applied to to things that are noticeably out of whack or seriously out of whack - instead of trying to fulfill every noob's insignificant whim out there.i leave you an exercise, take the case of the dramiel and drake which many forum posts have been making noises lately. figure out which one's the result of a balance exercise and which one's is the result of responding to changing tactics."
11/14/2010,"for the misunderstanding, when you say something can never happen it is saying it's 'impossible' to me. call me an idealist, but statements with such a finality and reeking of defeatism tick me off, and if you didn't mean that then take it as an overreaction on my end.for the 'exercise' - it comes off as patronizing, for future reference, but i'll bite anyway. i don't know the history of changes completely so i won't say i'm an expert on the specific matter. if i had to take a random guess, the dramiel would be the balance change and the drake the tactics change, primarily due to the drake fleets being relatively new and the dram being lauded since when i first began playing."
11/14/2010,"so?seriously, so what if some new players get discouraged and have to skill for something else? as you point out, caldari are the princes of pve, which is well and good and why many new players skill up along that path. but it's not that long to get into another race, either. iirc it's about a month to get into a perfectly decent t1 fit apoc. and times are somewhat similar to get into other ship types as well. to say nothing of how the whole ""but new players might not like it."" meme misses the point. if people can't handle making choices and differing skill paths and so on, eve isn't the game for them. sure, when i first got into eve i was also pretty disappointed to learn that it would take years to skill into a titan and even then i'd probably never afford one. i was also pretty disappointed to learn that all the best mods cost more than i was grinding in an entire year of pve. should i, then, have been given an officer fit titan?obviously, a bit of disappointment is natural.caracal is a decent throw-away cruiser. crow is a pretty nifty interceptor (as far as 'ceptors go). ferox isn't bonused for it but in the days before they added the drake, most folks skilled for caldari flew it before they got to battleships. and so on. to say nothing of the fact that active tanking a pvp ship is rarely a good idea anyways.if someone likes the game and wants to expand outward from missile boats, they can do so pretty easily. it's not like the strange people who roleplay caldari and refuse to fly any other hull."
11/14/2010,"don't get me wrong, i see where you are coming from, op, i just don't really see the great merit in your argument. unless you want to head towards a direction where basically each race got the same ships, only differing in names and graphics effects for their weapons. and that, with all due respect, sounds boring as ****. i am more than willing though to trade the amarr pilgrim for the caldari falcon and the armageddon for the scorpion likewise to help the caldari with gun issues. and just for the record - as a nub i used to fit on both maller and prophecy projectile guns because it works in fact better that way than with lasers. so similar issue there as with the afs... just to illustrate the point that not ""the poor caldari"" are the only ones with ""ship issues"". theorethical fitting options do not automatcally correspond to what you do in game, same as with my points about afs in my last post.i steadfastly believe furthermore that your point about the handicapped training for caldari due to is not quite right. sure, if you factor in the training for all available caldari ships on a high level plus crosstraining that might look that way, but the other races got similar issues. for example the whole bunch of missile support skills for the few missile boats amarr have. the general issue that as minmatar you have to train both shield- and armor-tanking, missiles, projectiles and drones well. and i could name even more, tbh.even if at first glance it might look like an overbearing burden to you, unless you can back that claim up with a bunch of conclusive numbers, i don't buy it. looks to me more like ""working as intended"". of course, if a ccp dev wants to chime in and contradict me by stating that in fact caldari ships are totally broken..."
11/14/2010,"thank you for your responses and critique. this constructive argument helped me to see something i haven't until now. as my original idea was not to complain, but to see why, your input is valuable.ofc, any further input or point of view from someone else is appreciated."
11/15/2010,"i have a great idea to combat suicide ganks without any of the changes suggested being implemented.create a cargo scan jammer. one simple, active high slot module that will keep those looking to snoop out of your business. if a potential ganker scans your ship and gets jammed, it means 1 of 2 things, either you're carrying something valuable and you want it kept secret or you are luring them into a potential gank mistake.the gankers keep saying that high sec isn't safe and there should be risk for reward, well, here is theirs. if you find a ship with an active jammer, take a shot.you may get lucky or you may get taken. fair is fair."
11/15/2010,i'd just get rid of insurance completely.personally i see no need for it. if you lose your ship and you cant afford to replace it then you shouldn't of been flying it in the first place.

11/15/2010,"it is obvious that dramiel is overpowered frigate, which has an unique position in frigsize rating.dramiel has a very wide range of targets and has good ability to escape from a battle. this ship has a good damage and also has a chance in many cases to leave the closefight and escape. it would be logical to cut the dramiel speed in 10-15% dramiel faster than the fastest interceptors, while still having good fitting solutions, has good dps like assauls ships. imho it is to much for one ship."
11/15/2010,oh **** someone has some balls you are going to get flamed.edit: but you are right look at the cynabal/vagabond almost the same speed so therefore shouldnt the jag/daredevil be close to the same speed? i think so i support this. nother edit i ment to say dramiel not daredevil.
11/15/2010,the dramiel is hilariously overpowerededit: fix some of the currently underpowered faction ship while we're there.
11/15/2010,"yeah, i agree the dramiel is overpowered, and it has really hurt frigate pvp in a lot of areas. the main reasons for this i think is it has the best slot layout, it can easily fit a dual prop setup with a medium shield extender, giving it almost twice the ehp of a standard dcii taranis, while also going twice as fast, similar dps with much better ranges, kiting ability and ability to leave, twice as agile, and capless weapons, as well as a healthy portion of its dps in drones which work at <60km and don't rely on the dramiel's tracking. it is very similar to a taranis, while having none of the 'ranis weaknesses. and it is very difficult to kill a dramiel (bearing in mind you need to be able to stop it from leaving, while at the same time being able to actually kill it, which is something which seems limited to bait fit ab/scram/web afs like the ishkur or jaguar, and such ships die to a counterfit dramiel with lr disruptor anyway.in my opinion, it needs to have the drone bay nerfed or needs to have the slot layout changed so it cannot easily fit dual prop and mse."
11/15/2010,"not supported. dont nerf the dramiel, buff the frigates that need buffing. if you nerf the dramiel, you nerf the jaguar because my jag will kill a dram any day. buff the hawk and the rest of the garbage."
11/15/2010,"if you nerf the dramiel, you nerf the jaguar because my jag will kill a dram any day. you are a ****** a dramiel would own any jag anyday and if it couldnt it would just fly away."
11/15/2010,"worm,cruor and the subbucus all have lol dps and speed when compared to a dramiel."
11/15/2010,"funny, my corp mate took out a dramiel with an ishkur. funnier is i used my curse in a mock battle with my corp and made a dramiel no better than a bantam. ps curse is win."
11/15/2010,think it must be 20%strip claw with mwd 4000m/sstrip dramiel with mwd 5000m/s
11/15/2010,"an ishkur or a jaguar can kill a dramiel with an ab/scram/web fit, as i mentioned above (assuming the dramiel is in the bread&butter dual prop fit, if the dramiel has ab/scram/web/mse he is able to run, although has to do it a bit earlier than he otherwise would) however, it doesn't mean the dramiel is not overpowered, the fact that it can go toe to toe with assault ships, while also being faster and more agile than interceptors, with more escape options is what makes it overpowered.also claiming that your curse shuts one down is irrelevent as a curse equally shuts down every other frigate in the game and additionally is not related to the dramiel, since it is not a frigate, and therefore not really an argument to this proposal."

11/15/2010,purging characters that are over 3 years old and have never had a paid subscription would be a great thing for cleaning up character names and even saving ccp some database space. it would be nice to see how many accounts would be effected by the purge and what benefits it might give to ccp at the least.
11/15/2010,good idea.
11/15/2010,"do want. i heard they were removed because they were causing server side lag, which was frankly the most baffling thing i've ever heard.bring them back, please. long trails was the main reason i trained up interceptors before anything else."

11/15/2010,"supported. ^^ yes they should have to change every other **** hull out there. the scorpion got fixed, so should the moa and uh what else how about the freaking bellicose like... please make the ships look cool....edit.some ships look cool to me like the stabber but still have ******ed engines in weird places ccp should also take off the big engines on the side of everything like wtf."

11/15/2010,personal hangars? the whole point of this is privacy. it will create a better hierarchy system and create a better system of control and power. i wouldn't assume any problems would rise.
11/15/2010,"o/ fellow lemmings and capsuleers.with the upcoming expansion i fear we will get our (tiny) butts kicked by the sansha in high sec.so far concord has barely helped us out in sansha related incursions and we even got betrayed at least once by a concord pilot (sutola endoma),where she became a slave too nation (slave endoma01).even the empires have yet too formulated a co<U+FFFD>rdinated response like they once did in the good old days (eve chronicles - sanshas nation).the least they can do is help us capsuleers deal with this upcoming threat with some political support and adress the ban of capitals like carriers and dreadnaughts by concord (gm grimmi, i believe).since political will is tight into day by day issue's it will not be strange that the populace of new eden will cry out for more protection once sansha start hitting harder and the empires response is a bare minimum.already we see that political pressure toward concord has made it possible that a few capital ships are allowed too remain in high security space(hail cribba, hugs).so when concord assembly hall policy is clearly influenced by the empire's political will i wonder if its just a matter of time untill we see more capitals in high sec (pretty plz ccp).i understand we need too discuss pro's and con's for this proposal and i figure these have already been talked about in the past, but plz feel free too run through them again.but for heaven sake's think of the children ppl, they need protection from the monsters that is all,alpha 1"
11/15/2010,"nice reasoning,also i dont understand why capitals are still banned from hisec, since concord frgates have doomsdays and insta-newts, also ecmi would like to hear cons of capitals in hisec, since i cant figure out any real problems with that"
11/15/2010,"nice try. very nice try, actually.you want capitals back in highsec because of the rp element and pve.well, capitals were removed from highsec for a reason. no need to go back in time."
11/15/2010,nice reasoning indeed =dbut you missed the fact that you can't go into incursion sites with cap ships =3 on top of that incursion systems are all cyno jammed =3
11/15/2010,why were they reoved from highsec?
11/15/2010,veldspar protection act of yc 107.
11/15/2010,and what is that?
11/15/2010,"i'd love to see some capitals back in high sec myself if for no other reason than just because. it would certainly make high sec wars more fun and capital ships more numerous. i imagine they were worried about capital ship mining abuse by macros, eh?"
11/15/2010,they were removed because carriers were like freighters are nowand inb4 highsec wars are cap blobs
11/15/2010,i want capitals to camp jita 4-4 23/7 as well... if only for the epic whines to be had...
11/15/2010,sub capitals are allowed in high sec. what do you think battleships are?

11/15/2010,"although i have no personal beef with learnings and i understand why they were put in (so newer players to train to use stuff faster? right? maybe i am wrong), i have to agree that this would be the best measure for all of eve.no, new players do *not* have to sit and train learnings for 2 weeks / a month to get things done. however, it would benefit them.anyone i've tried to introduce to this game i've had them make their character a month in advance and then train learnings to 5/4 before starting starting. :p"
11/15/2010,why remove them? make them unavailable to any toon that is younger than x amount of skill points.the argument that new toons skill this for month 1 to month 6 is solved.they are only available after a toon gets up to ( example: 15 million skill points ).new players are forced to play as if they are unavailable. you play long enough you have additional skills you suddently can/have requirements for.removing them - not supported.
11/15/2010,"this is ridiculous, are you even aware of how long getting to 15 million skill points would take without learnings?training anything takes way too long which is why people feel forced to pick up the learnings in the first place. they should be removed, and skill training times brought down across the board. number one reason i hear of people quitting who just started is ""training nothing for a couple weeks in order to train anything at not snail speed is ******ed"".and for the trolls spewing the ""eve is supossed to be hard lulz"" garbage: it should be hard to play, not a test of endurance of who quits because of not being able to fly anything first. the way things are it is very difficult for a new player to enjoy the game, and older players have an unsumournable advantage.this is ******ed and terrible design if ccp ever wants to get more players and make eve a more successful game.get rid of this terrible design asap, please."
11/15/2010,no micropayment! no plex for anything!
11/15/2010,no.
11/15/2010,"clearly, sarcasm is lost on you. i'll put it plainly. 1) create a fleet with six ships in each squad. 2) put each of the other ships in the squad in your watch list3) when one member of your watch list becomes primary, but your defensive bubble on it, absorbing 100% of all directed damage. use logis to repair and repeat until dt... have food and drink delivered and tie a bladder bag to your leg, because unless you self destruct or are met with a significantly larger fleet, this will take a while."
11/15/2010,"professor screweyes, here's an alternate scenario:i fly my falcon which is fitted for maximum ecm power, eschewing any pretence of tanking. it's all ecm and hypnos boosters, with something like 2k ehp.my 4 friends flying with me pilot heavily plated dominixes with this ""damage redirection"" module. their dominixes each have in the order of 60k ehp.we get into combat, my friends activate their ""damage redirection"" module on my falcon. in order to blow my falcon up, the enemy will have to do 240k damage.as opposed to your scenario where no matter how many ehp my friends could restore to my ship every second, the enemy would only need to deal 2k damage in one salvo to blow up my falcon.this single-salvo damage is often referred to in pvp circles as ""alpha strike"" or ""alpha"" for short. there is a very real difference between tanking versus dps or tanking versus alpha. you must realise that a damage redirection module is not in any way, shape or form equivalent to a remote repper.another application of a ""damage redirection"" module would be rr smart-bombing bs fleets with logistics support. the battleships cluster in close together, the rr orbit them tightly, and the bs activate the damage redirection module on their assigned logistics ship. so now not only do your attacks against the logistics craft get mitigated by the craft's speed and signature, you also have to chew through the vastly superior ehp of a plated battleship with your mitigated dps in order to destroy that logistics vessel.using a module such as this to simulate the effects of ""line of sight"" is - to my thinking - an acceptable compromise, except when it comes to having multiple ships redirecting damage from one target. if it was implemented, this damage redirection module would have to act like a tractor beam - only one should be allowed to be active per target.in the meantime, option 2 appeals to me somewhat, though i'd prefer such a ""bubble"" to cloak all ships inside it, in the same way as a prototype cloaking device does (as opposed to a covert ops cloaking device). ships inside the bubble would be able to target enemies, but doing so would decloak that ship. yes, i love the arbitrator in starcraft :)of course, i'd much prefer option 1 was replaced by actual line-of-sight firing rules, due to the opportunity to explore creative formations as part of space combat tactics."
11/15/2010,i like the second option
11/15/2010,"so what happens when i use my two nyxes and three aeons to ""guard"" my super-tanked hic?itt: virtually every un-implementable and/or stupid idea imaginable regarding fleet mechanics."
11/15/2010,it would be like a hic only 1 type of ship can use itsay t2 bc and with a bubble around itany ship inside the bubble will be unable to target anythingthe ship making the bubble can not get rrso if you escort an industrial you can get the industrial in warp inside the bubble but the bubble is useless in big fleet battles
11/15/2010,"for escorting freighters bring plenty of rr.escorting dst and indi's , make them fit cloaks.if you run into a camp cloak the indi's and have your excort fleet dispatch teh attackers."
11/15/2010,not the whole corporation. just the one character that uses the plex.
11/15/2010,"alright, thanks for clearing that up. however, that still makes things too complicated. what if, for example, two corps at war square off in empire space, and some pilots on either side have the protection you are suggesting? does that mean that if anyone in the opposing corp takes any action against such a pilot, they will get concorded, while at the same time the pilot that has the protection is free to fire away at the wartargets? if you want it to work, then you should make it work both ways, iow, having this protection simply places you ""outside"" the wardec: you will yourself get concorded for attacking your wartargets. otherwise, i can see this getting horribly overpowered, as plex-protected gangs can roam around looking for wartargets, and be more or less completely immune to them. it will simply be too powerful in my opinion.i still believe you have a point, but that this is not the way to go about it. an alternative idea could be to somehow use isk in order to buy immunity to locator agents during a wardec, although it is arguable if not even that might break it somewhat.i think that it is better to leave wardeccs as they are. the only thing i would like to see personally changed is the price tag - i would not object to the price for all kinds of decs being multiplied by quite a large margin. look at this:raise wardec prices"
11/15/2010,"i really don't want a micro transaction that makes it more difficult to kill someone.perhaps instead, use the concord lp points that you will be able to get from doing incursions?"
11/15/2010,no.
11/15/2010,"yes, many caldari gunboats need more powergrid.i don't know if caldari railboats really need more turrets or dronebay. they are obviously designed for sniping.i'm fine with the fact that caldari railboats do less damage at point blank then other races' ships. but they should deal competetive damage at typical fleet ranges.for example the rokh should reach 170 km with cn thorium with a sniper fit to compete damage wise with t2 ammo of other races' damage bonused ships.so, yes pls more range for caldari t1 and a different secondary bonus for caldari t2.a plain buff to railguns will probably make gallente ships more interesting, but certainly not caldari railboats."
11/15/2010,no not supported.1. we need to rebalance hybirds as a hole first before you work on ships.2. stop crying about pg on shield ships. you get higher cpu lower pg. armor ships get higher pg lower cpu thats the way it is.

11/15/2010,"i have run idea past the ideas forum in this thread, i think it has gathered some feedback to be posted under csm proposals.in the nutshell i think eve size has become too small and would benefit from increased amount of space, both in 0.0, wormhole and core systems (empire space).thank you for attention."
11/15/2010,"size isn't your problem, density is.within any particular system and its hundreds of cubic au there's only a few grids worth paying any attention to, everything else is just dead and empty or at best is a public bookmark to warp to.give systems more weight, more things for us to do inside them, and your issue largely goes away."
11/15/2010,"require an account password to be changed every 30 days, from date of account creation. deny login until password has been changed.an interview with jared psigoda, a well known gold-farmer/rmt broker, in which he states this would stop most accounts being hacked:"
11/15/2010,"very not supported. this would make the game too annoying to play, i already have ten random passwords like that for school, don't wanna deal with that for my spare time.also i would think the issue of people not being able to get in their account would be a bigger problem for csm and their customer support, too."
11/15/2010,"...or just don't be stupid about your password?sorry, but my pw for eve is a randomized string of 16 letters/numbers. i don't want to re-learn it every single friggin' month"
11/15/2010,hoe about we change rl so we cant do that. omg there should an assembly hall in rl my proposals right there.edit: and yeah kamikaze frigs xd
11/15/2010,i support all things that run along the line of capital car bomb. also. seriously ccp. make a module in game that does what that bs just did to drop the titan and support fleet.
11/15/2010,yes yes yes yes do want. then i can just fly a super cap into the enemy capital staging station and killing a few hunderd caps and thousands of ships and modules in one blow with only the build cost of the super cap as a loss (wich is low)
11/15/2010,wow i never even noticed that tiny little thing lmao
11/15/2010,yes please
11/15/2010,ccp will probably do something literally ******ed to enforce the use of incarna for things currently done within the existing eve client. it's too easy a solution to the problem of not having any compelling gameplay ideas we'll find out in a few months if my doom-mongering is justified.
11/15/2010,i have to agre with tea. after seeing the beat them with a stick for invations. you will probly have to got to market hubs inside stations or go see your agents in person now or something lolz.
11/15/2010,"hope not...csm was adamant that lame crap like that made no sense (""don't agents have phones, after all? we should be able to call them from our pods...it is 20,000 years in the future, right?"") and should be specifically be avoided. forcing players to do anything in station that they could previously do in their ships will do nothing but **** off everyone who has zero interest in incarna and no plans to ever step foot in a station. that is probably more players than ccp thinks.considering that after four years of putting resources on incarna, they plan to design, code, and test ""game play"" (hopefully something more substantial than an eve version of some already-existing third-party mini-game) in a mere 8 months (or perhaps slightly longer if incarna is also delayed due to the incursion delay), i'd say asking for additional testing time on sisi is a wise idea. the sooner we have something, anything to respond to on sisi, the better.slightly tangential: unfortunately, csm's--and most likely players'--definition of gameplay seems to be different than that of the incarna team's. i have created a thread on our internal forums to specifically discuss incarna gameplay and am waiting for torfi, noah, and anyone else working on incarna game design to engage there."
11/15/2010,if ccp can show us how this is more than a virtual chat room with pretty new colors i would support this thread. as it stands people have been asking for years how this will integrate into the game beyond cosmetics and have been met with silence.i still believe this is simply a tech demo for wod. launching and staying even more half assed than faction warfare
11/15/2010,this.with the information we have incarna is nothing more than a ghost for meps: i don't believe in ghosts
11/15/2010,agree'dthis forum should not be troll bait or have scewed numbers.
11/15/2010,"1. as already proven, the term ""blob"" is a meaningless snarl word and arguments advanced for 'fixing it' are baseless. 2. fixing sov is good. nobody who understand game mechanics is on the ""stop cooperation!"" bandwagon. there is no problem. there is a problem with people who can not or will not adapt and can not or will not vacate a niche once they're no longer able to compete, and want ccp to wave a wand and help them rather than playing eve to accomplish things in eve. which is why i've said time and again that there are and should be many valid playstyles and if someone doesn't have fun at one, they should try another. odd how you made such a mistake.do try to explain, though, how ""a is fun for some."" implies ""and thus b can't be fun for anybody!"" there is someone trying to dictate what is and isn't fun. it's not me.inappropriate comments removed. jericho your argument has been debunked on its merits time and time and time again.if you're not lying, show the syllogism you claim exists and has a major or minor premise that you suggest. actual, non-forged quotes, by the way. any time now. a very odd lie as the actual post is right above the lie about it. there's something like five paragraphs taking your nonsense to pieces and pointing out that your desire for to have ccp help you accomplish things in eve is nonsensical if you can't actually accomplish things on your own power in eve. shrieking, mind-reading and, damn i don't even know what that is... you are not a spokesman, you don't have a valid scientific sample. and no, if some people complain about lag then you can't conclude that tens of thousands of players must really not be enjoying how they play the game. talk about invalid and unsound...no, not even with trolling about how people aren't actually enjoying themselves, and you know better than them that they're just feeling ""mistaken"" ""pride?"" how about you let people decide what they want to do in the game and if you don't like it, you do something else that you enjoy. i know, crazy!although there is something truly hilarious about your view that 10's of thousands of people spend centuries of man-hours on a game doing something that they don't like (but only you know that they don't like it, they don't realize that and keep doing it). again a lie about something that's just a few inches above the lie. very strange. of course, you deliberately conflate the (social engineering), fc'ing, and disgruntled allies ****ing **** up. because you don't have a point about the first two, and really don't even have one about the third other than that some people don't like the specific game mechanics used in one specific situation, well."
11/15/2010,"yes i hear having a good fc in a 2000 vs 1000 man fleet through lag is a great example of people making a difference in eve.inappropriate comments removed. jerichoand despite claiming i have no proof that people arnt having fun i have provided you with far more proof than what you have been providing for them having fun. they dont have a great choice atm... they can be bored and ""win"" or can have slightly more fun and never have the ability to break into 0.0... lots of people go for the former."
11/15/2010,"finnagain needs to stop trumpeting i have proved you wrong again and again (without actually proving anything) and actually read what people are saying before launching into some pro-blob crusade. i think the only person who believes your 'arguments' is you, and i'm not even entirely convinced you know what you're saying half the time. you just spit out the first angry and bitter thing that comes into your head. you appear to have trouble understanding so i'm going to point it out for you again.80% of the csm candidates recognise blob warfare as an issue.a good chunk of the csm were voted in on the back of their policies on blob warfarethis means the general player base has a problem with blob warfarethus there is a problemunderstand now?"

11/15/2010,"throughout history, war has been a balance between having power, and being able to use it. battles required manpower, but also the ability to project it.one of the largest problems that faced your thousand man armies was that you needed a balance between having men on the line, and spreading the line too thin. if you're 50 men deep at all sections of the line, there's less men who can fight your enemies at one time. if you're 2 men deep at all sections, it's easier for your enemy to drive a wedge and break through. while being attacked from behind is somewhat irrelevant in a game like eve, the thing to take home from what battles are like in the real world is that when you bring a large amount of numbers, it also takes a large amount of training to use it effectively.being killed by a blob (i'd say 4:1 odds, taking into account ship types and experience, but it shifts downwards as you bring more people) isn't fun. losing a ship 1v1 sucks, but losing it to superior numbers and superior ships makes people wonder why they bother playing eve at all. the main reason blobs are so popular and so successful is that you can get literally anyone in a blob, and all they have to be able to do is warp to gates, jump through them, ctrl click on things, and hit f1. the amount of skill involved in coordinating blob warfare basically amounts to the fc being able to call targets, and the blob being smart enough to know how to click once or twice and hit f1.while i can understand that large scale fights are part of the attraction for some to eve online, and i personally find them interesting, the fact that there's no downside to bringing 200 people against a single person feels unbalanced. there's no skill or training necessary for fleet members to engage in blob warfare and that's what makes it so easy to do.while i love eve for the way it brings people together, eve should not be a game where all it boils down to is whoever has the most people in their alliance wins. it's this reason that there are so many power blocs. why would you join an underdog and be guaranteed a loss when you can join one of the big groups and almost never risk your ship?eve is a game about player skill. from playing the market, to knowing how to fit and pilot your ship. i see no reason why fleet engagements should be any different. if a change was made, yes, it would mean that various alliances would actually need to start training their pilots in more then ""lock primary, hit f1"" but i, and i'm sure many others, honestly believe that large fleet battles would become much more interesting and involved then they currently are with the result being the large majority of players having more fun."
11/15/2010,"you're welcome to show how any argument i've advanced is either invalid or unsound. the general avoidance, dishonesty and simple obvious lying that some posters have used in order to ignore my arguments is, however, prima facie evidence that if anybody could have rebutted let alone addressed them, they would have. one might notice you didn't, for example.bandwagon fallacy. again, you're welcome to actually address the arguments and show how they're invalid or unsound. something tells me that won't happen, however.the bandwagon fallacy is not called a fallacy because it's a really, really awesome argument. if tomorrow 80% of people thought that the sun was made of a gigantic butterscotch candy, it still wouldn't be. if you can address the actual logic involved it'd be much more cogent than ""nuhn unh!!!"" off topic comments removed. jericho"
11/15/2010,"a second ago you were arguing that the game is fine because many people dont have an issue with it... now you are arguing that many people having an issue with it is just a ""bandwagon fallacy""?"
11/15/2010,"that is a lie.i've never said any such thing. if you claim you're not lying, quote it. another lie and another one where the actual post you're lying about is right above your lie. again, what was actually said:"
11/15/2010,i believe minigin is referring to this:although i can't be sure.perhaps it's best if certain parties in this thread took a break and stopped accusing each other of lying and instead focused on trying to make the game better for the majority of people -- as that's the goal of this forum.
11/15/2010,"he might be, but if that's the case then he's lying. my quote is about how mini was (again)claiming that 10's of thousands of people who've devoted centuries of man-hours to a game and often log on by the thousands in order to play for hours at a stretch aren't actually enjoying their playstyle. that doesn't touch on, at all, the claim that ""the game is fine because many people dont have an issue with it"". in fact, it doesn't touch on whether or not the game is ""fine"" at all, but whether or not people are having fun despite mini's claim that he knows better than they do whether or not they're having fun. i have advanced numerous arguments about game mechanics and the lack of any objective definition for the snarl-word ""blob"". they've been scrupulously ignored and, instead, 'honest misunderstandings' like mini's keep getting trotted out, like how he ignores that one of his compatriots has based his argument around the bandwagon fallacy and instead goes on the attack with another fictitious claim. i'd be happy to take a break from pointing out that other posters are lying if they'd stop lying. i hardly think it's unreasonable if, when someone lies and invents something that i never said, that i point out that i didn't actually say it."
11/15/2010,"while i respect where you are coming from, i'm not at all impressed that you pick peoples posts apart and respond to small sections that you want to and and less impressed again that you've done the same to my response that was seeking to diffuse the bickering in this thread.arguing about whether or not minigin is lying has so far led to you saying he is, and him saying he isn't. there's very little ground to be won here. what i said was that instead of arguing about whether someone is lying we should be talking about how we can make eve a better, more interesting game. there's nothing gained by constantly attacking other players when the aim of this thread was to bring to the attention of the csm that people voted for the current csm because of their priorities, and amongst those priorities was addressing the perceived imbalance or lack of interesting gameplay in ""blob warfare"".i like good thread derails as much as the next person, but i'd wager this one has gone on long enough and you start look foolish for continuing it."
11/15/2010,"i think you're the one ignoring logic here finn. the logic is that this is a video game, and at the end of the day the objective is to have fun. if 80% of the player base are saying something needs to be fixed, then obviously logic would dictate that it is not a fun mechanic."
11/15/2010,"please, can you point out this ""80% of the player base""?by name, not ""i know a lot of people that want if fixed so it 80% of the playerbase that want it fixed"". take a poll or ask ccp to take it, knowing that only positive replies (i.e. blob warfare need fixing) against total players number count as abstaining usually mean that the person isn't interested in the issue. the basic problem is that the players want small group to count and make a difference when they are the people trying to do that, but hate it when they are the large number of players suffering because a small group can destroy what they have done. put it another way, we all feel that we are the ""hero"" of the tale, so we should be capable of fighting and winning against overwhelming odds and all the other players should be the conprimaries in our tale or the enemy cannon fodder.but that work in a single player game, not in a mmorpg. asking for changes in the game mechanics so that smaller groups get ""stronger"" than larger groups is following the hero mentality. exactly because ""this is a video game, and at the end of the day the objective is to have fun"" you can't pretend to put your ""fun"" above other people fun and be capable of destroying alone what 10 people had done or that a group of ten could easily destroy what has required a group of one hundred to create, and so on. sure there will be less fun for those that want to conquer, destroy and so on but increasing their fun would be at the expense of the fun of the people that want to keep what they have. so ""fixing"" the so called ""blob warfare"" would be reducing the enjoyment of the game for those on the ""blob"" side to increase it for those in the ""non-blob"" side, i.e. taking from 100 to benefit 10. not a good idea."
11/15/2010,"from a practical business standpoint, this is not quite true. if, for example, the 20% who love committing blobbery would all quit the game if the blobs were destroyed, but the 80% who hate blobs (and want them fixed) would still play even if they were retained, the rational game design team would keep the blobs. it's not just numbers; intensity factors in as well.note that i campaigned in part on introducing game design changes that would break up or highly modify blobs, but not to attack blobs per-se (though i personally don't like that kind of fleet experience), but because i felt it was needed to fight lag. still do, btw..."
11/15/2010,"spineless like the rest of csm thus far... you get to iceland realise ccp are people rather than things on the internet and you go soft. i dont feel sorry for you, you should have put your name in so that you can advocate for your beliefs and for those who voted you in. if this was ever more than a free trip to iceland for you, step up and do more. no one cares if ccp ignores you, but you practically arnt trying atm. go do something radical like get all the csms together and refuse to meet again until you are taken seriously, cause some drama cause some scandal, make ccp listen.until we see you trying you will get no easy relief for ""hey guys im for you... but ccp wont listen anyway""."
11/15/2010,"some solid research would be really nice. come on, the economics team are some pretty smart folks, they know (or should know, at least) that in a game like eve taking a simple snapshot and then not even really analyzing the data is worse than useless. take, for instance, the ""x percent of players are in empire during our snapshot.""it's utterly useless without analysis. how many of that x percent are above, say, 1 million sp?how many of those not over 1 million sp are on accounts that are 2+ years old? how many of them have placed more than 25 buy/sell orders in the week leading up to the snapshot? how many of them are on accounts with one or more characters that was in nullsec/lowsec at the time of the snapshot?how many of them share ip addresses with an account that has one or more characters that was in nullsec/lowsec at the time?how many of them are in a ship that has a cyno and lo?how many of them are in noob corps and are skilled only for hauling?how many of them have not been active since 2004?and so on. there's great potential for the economic newsletter to really elucidate the nuts and bolts of eve and show what's going on, but ccp has not been using it to anywhere near its full potential. and yah, it's about time that someone gave us some accurate figures on macroers reported/investigated/banned. not rmt'ers (necessarily), but macroers. doesn't have to be the qen, but outside of publicity stunts like unholy rage, most of us get the impression that nothing is being done."
11/15/2010,"i'd like to see the number of missions given out by agents for the reporting period, broken down by region, with the top 10 agents named and shamed."
11/15/2010,i'd like to know how many pages i've sniped.
11/15/2010,can you post a post summary of the questions and answers as discussed at the round table.
11/15/2010,we'll release the chat log from the moderated channel after the roundtable so those who are unable to attend can see the questions and responses.
11/15/2010,"damn, that's exactly what i was going to ask is anyone at ccp really in doubt whether they should increase its powergrid? other than that, nice initiative. i wish it would be of any usefulness."
11/15/2010,"no, we just cant tell you everything ccp tells us. for example, we've known for a long time which csm features would (most likely) end up in incursion. however, in order to correctly manage expectations (features may be dropped at the last minute) we can't tell you right away.the nda exists so ccp can tell us things they cannot tell the general playerbase yet, and is of great use to us. the june summit meeting minutes showed that they do not use the nda to censor us when our opinion is not a positive one."
11/15/2010,"jimm mayfield,125,171,203,79,161,163,48"
11/15/2010,"i dont know if i will be on for this, but things i would hope are discussed:1. is csm really having an impact on the shaping of this game?2. if so, how? / if not, in what way can we achieve a better voice for the playerbase?3. state of 0.0 (that is to say everything from stagnant sov / coalition systems / supercap production rates / instant travel etc.)4. how we can get more people and more groups out into 0.0?if i hear one more csm make an excuse about why nothing will change rather than how we can either convinse/force ccp to look at issues... just do the job you have been elected to do. if you cant please step aside for someone with a better idea of how to get things done."
11/15/2010,"if you think for a second that pl as an organization is smart enough to develop a method to hack eve, but stupid enough to both publicly acknowledge and link to it on our website, you have the intelligence of a sack of hammers."
11/15/2010,"i have had enough of these patches like many other capsuleers. i propose that csm should petiton ccp to roll back to pre-tyrannis. no one really cares all that much about pi, its a cool idea but its secondary to getting a stable client. how about you do some work on the mac client so that when i turn on audio so that i can hear my damage alarms, the game doesent crash while fighting npc's causing me to loose my ship. and to add insult to injury, some incompetent pos gm tells me there is no evidence in the ""logs"" (aka i would have to actually do work to help you so go away) even when i offer to provide video evidence that it's a client issue. but that's another issue. tl;dr: let's go back to dominion until ccp can get their **** together and make an expansion that doesn't need 5+ patches."
11/15/2010,when one door closes another one opens.nuff said(so i disagree with you)
11/15/2010,"even if we assume that would fix all/most problems with current eve, it would never happen. for a very simple reason. the pencilpushers at ccp would never allow it as it would create a massively negative pr for the company. the risk of appearing to be a company that totally screwed up the further development of their main product will be seen as way too risky. no matter how bad the actual ""progress"" turns out to be, the laws of ""corporate management won't allow for it. or in other words... welcome to 21st century capitalism."
11/15/2010,now that the item ids have all gone 64bit along with various other changes i doubt a rollback is technically an option without having to revert the database to a months old backup (which would be even worse than letting pi limp on till incursions).
11/15/2010,if you were going to roll back why on earth would you choose dominion?
11/15/2010,"well i think that the 64bit schema for database entries was a rather simple modification and could be applied do dominion. i think the roll back to dominion would be good because i felt it was ""good enough"" and an acceptable release. i agree with the fact the pencil pushers at ccp wouldnt be down for it. maybe i was just hoping that ccp could put aside gaining money by adding new shiny things in the short run and focus on maintaining their subscription base in the long run. it's sad to say but i can picture a day in the not to distant future where people start quitting left and right which basically forms a cascading effect of rage-quits because mmo's are not fun to play by your self."
11/15/2010,"there has been a lot of talk about whether its right for people to receive a insurance payout when they have had their ship destroyed via concorde.personally i would like insurance removed completely from the game.i wouldn't even allow insurance for new players as this can easily be abused.if you lose your ship regardless of how and can not afford to replace it, then you shouldn't off been flying it in the first place.just wondering what other people though about this."
11/16/2010,nonononono!
11/16/2010,"yes, just because i like to be different.honestly though, i don't really care if they happen or not. i mean after reading this thread it becomes painfully obvious that the fan base has no faith in ccp to do the right thing so you might as well reward them with exactly what they expect. i suggest you start by selling ships with unlimited health and ammo. after all, if you're gonna go out, go out big!"
11/16/2010,no.
11/16/2010,hell no !
11/16/2010,"yes.i can already start an account, buy some isk, and buy a 60m sp player all in one day. thats a hell of a lot more than a few remaps.gp"

11/16/2010,"here you go, balance fractions until the cows come home"
11/16/2010,"it is a mark of imbalance that all the faction ships with serious usage in pvp (as judged by the qen3) are angel cartel ships. drams have every single good thing that a frigate can have (besides a bomb launcher). no other ship of its class even comes close to competing with it, except the daredevil, which is essentially a dramiel killer that can't catch a dramiel in the first place."
11/16/2010,1
11/16/2010,"supported.all the angel ships really needed to be looked at twice before release. amazing that ccp can have the forethought to release some ships as pre-nerfed to hell and back, and yet somehow completely overlook these."
11/16/2010,"supported, i would say either slow it down or take its ability to fit dual prop/mse with an mapc fitted.either that or bring the others to its level. the dramiel although very overpowered at the moment doesnt need to have alot done to bring it back in line, certainly doesnt need to be sledge hammered by ccp which is what will happen inevitablyedit. cheers for suggesting a fix that wouldnt kill the ship off as something different to fly, dont want it going back to the days of having a turret bonus and more missile slots than turrets"
11/16/2010,remove the drone bay and increase mass by 10%.
11/16/2010,pick up one med slot and reduce the speed. it'll be ok
11/16/2010,"since ccp messed up and kept billing me keeping this account active, i shall bless the forums with my opinions on such things in the assembly hall starting with this thread./not supportedwhy? because if a hauler can kill a dramiel, then it is not op. i do not have hard stats and numbers to throw at you to support that. just simply, lol at haulers killing fotm faction frigates."
11/16/2010,so you think that just because some noob was in a dramiel and got killed by a badger its not overpowered? ive seen an omen take down a harbinger doesnt mean the harbinger sucks just means he was ****ing noob you ****** or that the omen pilot was like 100m sp.
11/16/2010,"fail fit is dumb. the dramiel is overpowered, compared to other frigates (besides the jaguar/ishkur/vengeance) meaning that, truly, the other frigates are the ones that are underpowered. cruor? sucubus? worm? pfft **** ships compared. you need to buff them. don't make the dramiel a piece of crap like the rest of them it is perfect as it is. you need to bring the others up to par."
11/16/2010,"at issue is the weakness of the other faction ships. i assume (hope) that sansha ships are going to be fixed in this upcoming release, as they are often sub-t2 in function. blood raiders ships are also lacking compared to t2 (ashimmu v curse for instance). gurista ships are fairly good, but could still use a small boost. angels are the only ones that really scale up from their comparable t2 ship (cynabal v vagabond for instance).don't nerf the dram, just fix the other pirate faction ships."

11/16/2010,"wild 0.0.. dominion coming out.. one-click sell multiple items.. if i'm going to vote on anything; i'd appreciate you bringing out a 'current' list. wild 0.0 is wormhole space, click and sell a stack; and you've got one-click sell multiple items(how unimportant is that anyway) you must be referring to everything in your hangar; which, is a completely unrealistic expectation. i can't even imagine how hard that would be to code; and with all the complaints about lag... let's just say it would be counterproductive. everything i looked at, is either implemented, or redundent, or uneccessary and potentially problem causing; though, i'll admit, i only clicked here and there on the list. my point is, i'm not sorting through all that; to find a few valid idea's or suggestions. i would ask that you truncate the list, reasonably; and consider the validity of many of the suggestions and idea's there. having people vote on all that, and sending in a list of most wanted additions and changes; is i think, going to lead nowhere, and end up with a lot of unsatisfied, frustrated people.cheers,"

11/16/2010,"destroyers indeed lack the edge they should have over frigates, which is a shame, considering that should be their role.i agree with the improvement on grid (not being able to fit all railguns on a cormorant is frustrating...) as well as the removal of the penalty to rate of fire.i would consider a rebalancing of modules as profitable: remove one high slots, add a low or mid-slot, depending on the ship."

11/16/2010,"i have to agree. though, the moa isn't as bad as some, there are quite a few ships that are even less than pleasant to look at. the gallente ships are the ones that are generally the worst for me. imicus(oh jesus christ why), atron(looks like someone sawed two different ships in half and glued them together), catalyst, thorax, vexor & dominix(just for their freaky face textures really) and alot of other plainly mediocre designs; ones that look distorted with no real direction or reason, aside from to tick all the boxes on their make-a-gallente-ship sheet. anyway, after the scorpion redesign, i was under the impression that ccp was already initiating (or atleast thinking about initiating) the process to sharpen up the older hull designs, and although i'd appreciate shinier ships sooner, i'd much rather have ships that actually functioned (atleast, to an extent). usable, reworked hybrids, afs/destroyers/gallenteshipsingeneral/faction ships rebalanced and that goddamn lag all need to adressed as soon as possible and i fear that ccp would be far happier avoiding the situation by making lots of pretty 3d models instead of doing something actually useful."

11/16/2010,"here's the deal, oh people who say this is a waste of time.model/graphic designers are not coders. asking them to redesign a ship means coders will have to focus on existing content rather than new content, as new content usually needs new models. so, if you want ships redesigned for aesthetic purposes, you should be in favor of this. if you want the code monkeys to be fixing stuff rather than making new content, you should want the graphics people tied up on things other than new content. simple as that."

11/16/2010,"common sense. using them to run mission and in wardecs would be too overpowered, without any reasonable counter to them. you can't suicide carriers the same way you can suicide faction battleships. if you want to play with them, you have to also risk losing them. it also gives people incentive to move out and try new things."
11/16/2010,"most missions have gatesso isn't the logical answer to add gates to other missions and not to ban capitals, also i'm pretty shure marauders do the job a bit better than carriersas for hisec wars,... like everything else in eve, you counter them with your own capitalshisec wars would change for shure, but why is that necessarily a bad thing?"
11/16/2010,"sorry vel, lol, that was supposed to say some, not sub. /fixed."
11/16/2010,"to the op: dude, ""to"" is spelled with one o, not two. unless you're like ""me too,"" which you weren't.caps it highsec? meh. if it's no supercaps allowed, sure, why not. just don't let them run missions, or be capable of targeting 'roids in hisec, so they'd be for pvp / incursions / logistics / pos-bashing only. although that would require letting caps into incursion sites, which would be rad."
11/16/2010,"lol, no worries dear. i did wonder what you were talking about."
11/16/2010,"i say yes, also concord doesn't guarentee their protection.but if you attack it your flagged to the corp, just to be fare.cept the veldnaught of course!"
11/16/2010,"oh, you think? ask chribba how much he made off the veldnaught each day if you think that's the case. i think he had said at one point, he was pulling in 100+ million isk a day by leaving it mining while he went to work. 29,531.25 veldspar/minute. 292k isk/minute. 17.5m isk/hour. 402m isk/day (23 hour days). 6 months of mining won't buy 1 month of plex? try about 1 day of mining will buy 1 month of plex.granted, ccp nerfed the cargo hold of dreads, so you can't afk mine for anywhere near as long as you used to be able to. but you can still do about a hour in a dread before having to dock and dump the ore, so you can only go afk for an hour at a time, so the afk income potential is less, but still fairly noticeable income for having to dock/dump/undock/warp/lock/engage modules every hour."
11/16/2010,"what about supercaps in high-sec then with full functionality? i mean, would be the next logical step, right?* insert random trolling *this whole idea/suggestion is getting worse the more i think about it..."
11/16/2010,"my main gripe about capitals being allowed into high-sec is three-fold:1. yes, it would vastly change the dynamics of high-sec... and not for the better. high-sec wars already have issues with neutral remote reppers, an issue that will only become worse with the introduction of carriers and supercarriers (not only will they be able to rep large amounts of ships but anyone stupid enough to actually shoot a carrier or supercarrier will be killed by the capital (unlike normal logis they are not defenseless)).2. since capital class ships are such force multipliers your only choices are to bring in more people or field your own capitals. this will exacerbate the problems of ""blobbing"" and ""capital proliferation.""more than that, not everyone in high-sec is so organized or wealthy to perform either counter and so a great deal many people will find themselves outclassed and/or outgunned. 3. major alliances will use high-sec as a ""sanctuary"" for capitals (you'd have to declare war against the alliance in question to take out their ""holding"" poss... which will be very expensive for your average corp/alliance). at least in low-sec you can do a ""surprise attack"" against a pos and only have to worry about gcc timers.other thoughts:- it would be way too easy (not to mention relatively ""risk-free"") to ship materials and ships around empire space, effectively raising the entry barrier to be an effective trader (you'd need your own carriers and jump-freighters to compete).- macro-miners would love to be able to field 15 to 25 mining drones in a ship that cannot be suicide ganked in a reasonable way.- not all missions have acceleration gates (ex. blockade missions)... you can bring any ship into those missions."
11/16/2010,player pirates mainly and the followup introduction of motherships and titans sealed the deal.
11/16/2010,"i read a thread whining about how railguns are much worse than the other turrets (my opinion doesn't carry much weight as the only turret i've ever used is hybrids and i quite like them, impossible to hit enemies close up though) well anyway, hybrid uses cap, ammo, whereas projectiles and lasers only uses one of these two components. couldn't we do something unique with cap and ammo together? now, i'm not really sure what the difference is between a coilgun and a railgun, so i'll refer to the prototype 425mm gauss cannon (which is a coilgun). when you fire the coilgun a magnetic projectile is fired away, if we do not include the coils' resistance then the force of the projectile would be the same as the energy used to fire it. e = (m*v^2)/2. the activation cost of a caldari navy railgun is 24gj (that's a ****load of energy). now we cannot determine the velocity (v) or the mass (m) of the projectile as apparently the hybrid charges are weightless. which renders this formula useless. now imagine having but one hybrid charge for each size calibre (i.e. 250mm, 350mm, 425mm etc.) and with a constant mass. lets call this charge ""425mm iron slug"". to determine it's damage you would have to increase/decrease the energy you use to fire the slug. the more energy you use to fire it the more higher velocity it will have (as the weight is constant) which means higher damage. to determine optimal and falloff you would have to calibrate your guns in some way, i havn't thought this through really as i wouldn't want balance issues but still be correct rp-wise. i think it could be fun with a different kind of weapon where you can alter damage and range with your cap. there would be no reloading as with lasers as you use the same charge all the time. thoughts?"
11/16/2010,"sure, let's also take into account conductor losses, maximum safe capacitor ripple current (wouldn't want to blow up your ship), emitted emi from switching and magnetic field generation, heating losses in wires and switches, projectile magnetic flux density saturation, etc, etc. oh, and there's the fact you can only use iron ammo.as much as i want to improve railguns, adding a bunch of math and crap isn't the solution."
11/16/2010,"guns in eve are about as unrealistic as ccp can achieve. that said, the problem with rails isn't rails specifically, it's caldari. more specifically caldari ships they are intended for. caldari are the range race, which they give up dps and alpha for. this means rails have to suck compared to lasers... or something."
11/16/2010,i thought i was able to do so at first
11/16/2010,"the learning tree does, imo, alienate new players and bog down veterans alike. it's essentially 2 months for increased training speed which should have just been there in the first place.i'm all in favor for completely removing the learning tree altogether (but refunding the sp in the process so they can be better spent elsewhere). and as recompense, base training speed should go at the speed of as if players already had trained the entire tree to 5."
11/16/2010,do this:almost triple base attributes (giving players a free remap to apply)change learning skills to be +1% attribute increase per level (learning skill too)change implants to be +1% too (+5 implant > +5%)fixed with minimal impact on current mechanics.
11/16/2010,whole-heartedly agree.not supported
11/16/2010,"very supported.learning skills add nothing to the game but a extremely frustrating period that scares people away, from personal experience.more people, more good times for everyone involved. eve should be about skill flying, not about skill waiting to wait some more to maybe fly something in a month or so."
11/16/2010,"the problem with learning skills is idiots keep telling new players they have to have them now. i tell new players to train them when they dont know what else to train.is it good that ccp wants to replace them, i cant say. it shows they at least understand the hole new and old players dug for themselves game longevitywise. i maxed every learning skill, i invested the time and money to do it. i did it informed of the pros and cons of doing it and because i saw it as a good investment long term.truly, the types of players that quit over training learning skills are the types of players that would quit anyway.i think the problem is the stigma attached to them, not the skills themselves."
11/16/2010,"vote 2010 is underway and we only have the option to say yes and add our opinion of priorities to the csm-ccp interface.i would like to see the option to vote no on specific items.reason:the list of options in the source list has a few items that i do not want implemented so much so that i want badly to vote against them.there are two distinct categories of 'passionate' issues:1. issues that request changes that impact player interactions directly2. issues that request changes that impact player interactions indirectlyindirect player interaction are observed through game mechanics, like industry, mining, hauling, etc.the problem with direct interaction changes results in the loss or gain of pvp combat.here is the underlying issue with a yes only vote - players will vote on their personal desires to improve the game they want to interact with. pve players will naturally vote to improve the game environment to better their experience. pvp players will also vote to improve their game experience. the problem is that pve players vote to impact the game through indirect changes (i.e. change mining, change missions, change environment, etc). pvp players will vote to better improve their chances to dominate their opponent directly (i.e. aggression timer, killmails, wreck loot, etc).voting only yes for each of the issues does not balance the wants of the community. although a pvp player might want better ways to dominate, others will specifically not want to see that issue implemented. therefore, if a no vote is allowed on, say, 3 issues, it is likely that the pve players will have a much stronger voice against obvious issues that ""unbalance"" the game. while pvp players 'no' vote will be diluted into the volume of other issues that would be viewed as 'less important'. the process that i have observed for the pvp player is that they have very few 'obvious' options to chose from and their voice is heard much more resolute than the diluted pve vote. pve players have way more issues to vote on, and have way more diverse interests; therefore, the pve vote is disperse in comparison (unless the issue is passionate). this might be the single reason we have observed ccp giving so much love to the pvp pirates, because there is no way to specifically voice opposition in this process. pve players need a mechanism to balance the voting process and bring resolution to the diffusion of our voice against direct player interactions.in summary:allow 3 no votes to the process. i realize it's too late for nov 2010, but it should have been done a long time ago.it should be easy to implement with counting (player name,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,no,8,9,10) using the forum bots used to count the votes.tl;dr - nope, not this time. read it.first edit:it seems that there is a viable alternative to a no vote for csm prioritizing. some suggestions herein indicate that putting the power of no in the assembly hall will result in the same voice necessary for the community to express wants.therefore, part b would be to either allow a no vote in csm priorities or a no vote in the assembly hall.*troll replies*no, not mad.no, you can't have my stuffno, this is not personalduh, it's a cool story, i know.no, just plain - no."
11/16/2010,very supported.
11/16/2010,"you raise some valid points.part of the problem is that there is a trade-off between making the process quick and easy, and accuracy of the data received. the process could require everyone to rank all of the issues, but that would be so cumbersome that only 5 people would vote, and 4 of them would be alts.the idea of anti-votes is an interesting one; the question is whether the additional complexity (for the voters, not for the poor bastard who tabulates the data) is worth the added accuracy, especially when you consider that this polling is used as advisory data to csm, so the judgment (or lack thereof) of csm members comes into play at a later date.i think it might be interesting to test anti-voting on a later prioritization to see what the results are. probably the easiest way to do it would be to have negative votes be negative numbers, ie: -37 is a vote against item 37.however, i think the other csms need to think about this and give their opinions."
11/16/2010,"it may be possible with the current system to identify voting patterns (using an automatic classifier such as autoclass which nasa used to find two different classes of infrared star in the galaxy), and have the humans identify patterns as ""nullsec pvp"", ""hisec pvp"", ""industrialist"" and ""pve"".i'm sure the members of the set of people who vote on ""balance destroyers"" are more likely to vote on ""review black ops"" than ""make mining interesting"", for example.once the easy-to-identify groups are discovered, determine the highest ranking requests from the two groups and build a combined list, rather than simply selecting the most popular changes overall.as an alternative to automatic classification, have a two-pass system where we first nominate a bunch of issues as being pve/pvp/industry/flavour, and then start the process of nominating issues for developer attention. then pick a few issues from each list which rate highest relative to the other issues from the respective list.my opinion is that negative votes will be too easily gamed."
11/16/2010,"i like how this thread easily splits eve players in 2 categories:pvp'ers, and mission runners.:(anyways, yes, this would be a nice option to have."
11/16/2010,"no!why:because that's not how the system worksthe list of issues there is filtered by the csm, those are the issues the players and the csm wantyou are not voting yes/no in that thread, you are only voting for the priority of the issue, and you cant have any valid reason vote down a priority, and by doing so postponing the issue.but!you are right, there should be a vote no option, but that should be handeled in the issue threads, by giving us a ""thumbs down"" option, or implementing some other better voting system in each thread (simple polls maybe)then an proposed issue could be voted down, and never make it to the csm prioritization listthere were proposals for a thumbs down option, i personaly think that's not good enough, we need a real (half automated) voting and issue tracking system adjusted to fit eve purposes, forums are not sufficient with any ammount of adjustments"
11/16/2010,-20? seems nice!
11/16/2010,"ah, false dichotomies. despite most of the blather in the op, i support the idea that assembly hall needs the ability to downvote ideas as well as upvote."
11/16/2010,"i was attempting to point out that all of eve is pvp. however, there are two types, indirect and direct. it is unfortunate that to avoid blathering ad nauseam, i had to resort to simple illustrations and the colloquial use of pvp and pve. i understand that it's not a simple 'this' or 'that' issue. it's hard communicate to a diverse audience and acknowledge known concerns in one concise post. i did not want to be concise because it's my post. i am more of the - ""say it twice in two different ways to reach more people"" - kind of person."
11/16/2010,"while i don't agree with the rationale, i do agree with the conclusion.i vote ""yes!"" to be able to say ""no!""(ami doin it rite?)"
11/16/2010,"/facepalmwhy do people keep insisting on arguing the easily countered point like they're some kind of game design guru?here's two counters i'll just crap out.1. increased damage to 'blocking' ships through reduced resists and higher signature. increases exponentially for additional blockers. range on modules should be within <10k even for bonused ships.2. limitations to number of activated modules. same range as above.if a fleet is designed to tank it should be able to tank. if your fleet designed itself for dps and tank, then grats, you didn't bring enough dps or alpha. tl;dr - i can use internet abbreviations too. presenting alternatives is one thing, slippery slope arguments of infinite doom and easily seen abuses doesn't amount to much more than herpderp when you can present a solution if you stopped for 3 seconds."
11/16/2010,"... or, your fleet could jump in *ahead* of the hauler, clear any hostiles, and then have you jump in."
11/16/2010,"yes, as another fleet chews up and spits out the token defence you left while the main force is *ahead* of the haulers."
11/16/2010,"or you could have one of the escort fleet, you know, scout ahead. i've heard that works well. hard to kill an indy ship if it isn't in the same system as the camp after all."
11/16/2010,"i hate to be a stickler about scientific jargon that i have relatively no true grasp of; however something i would like to see changed, would be form high school science classes when i was in school. scientific fact when a star is moving towards the eye, it appears redder while a star moving away from the eye is bluer in appearance; this is how scientists detect how a distant star is moving in the skies. though while i know it's only a small detail i believe that if when in warp the light around you is compressed therefore increasing the frequency in which you are exposed to it. low end frequency of light is blue/indigo in appearance while high frequency is red in color. i find that would only be a minor change that would bring a little more realism in to the game itself.by expression when moving in warp the light coming in to the eye in a forward direction would begin turning read rather then a blue appearance due to an increased frequency. while the same light from behind/ moving away would appear more blue in hue form a decreased frequency from the visual light spectrum. anyone agree that this would make sense?"
11/16/2010,"sounds good on paper, but it would not make for a pleasent game play experience. there is nothing realistic about matter traveling faster than the speed of light, so that ""problem"" would need to be solved first. at speeds sufficiently close to that of light, the effect of doppler shift is extreme enough to render blue shifted objects as white and redshift objects as black: not an entertaining view of the universe."
11/16/2010,"it's called ""red shifting"" and we already have such a phenomena (albeit subtle) in eve.when in warp, look towards the 'front' of the warp tunnel and you'll notice that space it is slightly 'bluer.' likewise, the back of the warp tunnel is slightly 'redder' than the surrounding space."
11/16/2010,this.though i think it's no where near as pronounced as it used to be.would support making it more visible.
11/16/2010,"wait, you want to see the rest of the universe the way the mortal proletariat do? no thanks, i'm a demigod and much prefer my elite perspective.that basically means that pod technology explains the lack of realism. sort of like sounds in space."
11/16/2010,"technically, in warp, you shouldn't see anything at all from behind you, since you are now outrunning the light in that direction.fortunately, this is a game."
11/16/2010,"that brutix has 370dps, almost as much as a good t1 cruiserand that on 1,5km range, that's just around 200 dps at 4km, which is as close as you are going to can get in an armor riged bc, and that's if youre lucky, 6km dps around 100 so a maybe 200dps brutix, with a active tank of 400..i didnt say it's impossible to fit, i said it lacks fittings because a fit like that sucks..... compared to anythingi'm not going to look at the hyperion numbers, but the same thing applies, only with that you wont be able to hit anything, ever, because of large blaster trackingall caldari ships can fit a rack of the smallest railguns, no problem, and youre trying to support this thread by fitting the smallest blasters to prove a point?my point still standshybrids need fixing first, then issues about ships should be raised, because now there's no problem with caldari gunboats, there's a problem with hybrids and all ships using them (except maybe mega)i do also apologize to everyone for the ot"
11/16/2010,you said try fitting them with an active tank like their designed and i did just that you ******. and those fits do exactly what those ships are ment to do the smallest medium rails on a ferox do not. and that brutix fit would easily own a blaster ferox so yeah... think before you speak derp.
11/16/2010,"try activating the drones *facepalm*gallentean drone boats should not have a huge amount of dps coming from the guns if they can fit 5 drones of the size they're designed for.1.5km range? you have an mwd, scram and web to slow your opponent down as you get in close to face**** them.brutix and hype are fine."
11/16/2010,"that's like saying it works because sometimes the other guy fails epically. lets be honest, if the other guy allows a brutix to get within scram range, he's made a big mistake or he's an idiot. in general, blaster boats are only functional when camping jita station or ganking an afk ratter/miner. that does not make those ships functional. outside those situations, which any other pvp-fit ship can also handle, they are useless, unlike every other pvp-fit ship.edit: the hyperion does have drones, so it is functional for ratting/missions."
11/16/2010,"let's start a new (actually not really new)topic about ""blasters suck"" but in this topic we should whine about ships unable to fit guns that would give them *limited* advantage over other ships. seriously, to actually outrange other weapon systems you need big guns and you can't bit them. and it you fit blasters instead of rails, besides general problems that blasters have, you get bad dps problem too.ccp should observe real player combat to make conclusions, when range is more important than gank, tank, speed and so on. idea that some extra range is such a huge advantage that they need to break every other detail of the ship is silly"
11/16/2010,"taken from an idea in the ships & modules forum, i'd like to suggest four new items for our friends in factional warfare.each race has a specific damage that it faces a lot of in factional warfare: the amarrians fight the minmatar, and need explosive resists. the gallente fight the caldari, and need kinetic resists, etc.this creates a resist table:amarr = explosive resistcaldari = thermal resistgallente = kinetic resistminmatar = em resistlet's add a damage control module designed to mitigate that sort of damage!<racial> navy damage control:armor <specific> damage resistance 19%armor <general> damage resistance 14%shield <specific> damage resistance 15%shield <general> damage resistance 12%hull <specific> damage resistance 67%hull <general> damage resistance 58%"

11/16/2010,"thanks for the clarification!anyway, i believe that organizing such csm votes and providing the required tools should not be entirely csm members' responsibility - you are not obliged to be software developers! if ccp really wants to have effective and transparent csm, they should invest 1-2 man/months to create some tools - e.g. on-line voting system."

11/16/2010,"first of all, ccp is completely within their rights to do whatever the hell they want to in eve online. they own all content within the game including your characters and all your virtual assets.secondly, even if there are gm alts in it alliance (i would be surprised if there wasn't given the size) test used obviously bull**** tactics that clearly works around intended ingame mechanics to gain an unfair advantage.now your main arguments are that it was: done before and nothing was done about it done by others and nothing was done about it but this is assuming that all other disputed sov claims using maint.'d tcus were both of similar size (14 goddamn claims) and against an alliance/coalition of comparable size (more people an alliance has the more they can spam their petitions). from what i understand, gms aren't particularly proactive, they generally require petitioning in order to solve player disputes. therefor the quantity of petitions and the overwhelming nature of test's gambit already shows how much of a disproportionate sway an alliance like it has in this case without ever needing to take gm alts into account. in comparason to smaller alliances dropping only a couple tcus in again smaller alliance sovreignty, where there's much less likelihood anyone would bother caring, let alone create a petition against it.tl;dr the entire situation is a nonissue, op is silly"
11/16/2010,"this whine thread is about a wardec that was retracted by a gm. internal affairs investigated and found the gm had made an ""honest"" mistake. now a bunch of people who are not associated with any of the involved parties are demanding that ccp publish the whole sordid affair as a devblog.but your final statement still holds true :)"

11/16/2010,"pretty sure the fitting window was created so that you could see everything you just described while docked and undocked...i'd like to hear your ideas for seeing the fittings without a fitting window. yeah. something about ""i want to have a fitting window but without using a fitting window"" is what i'm picking up in the op."

11/16/2010,i've found forced password changes result in users setting passwords which are easier and easier to brute-force.
11/16/2010,"the problem is that when forced to change passwords in this manner people start using stupid things like password1, password2 and so on, which would strike me as easier to hack\bruteforce in the long term.i know that when i have to deal with things like these, the sheer amount of passwords i deal with (bank, different labs at school, work) makes me end up setting them all to the same, and to rather ******ed things that anyone could guess like passw0rd.i'd support a reminder to not use the eve password in other sites, and not use the password here that you use in other sites when you make an account. or a keyfob if we are gonna get into hi sec territory."

11/16/2010,"i'd just love to see bounty hunting become a more involved part of the game. something i can sink my teeth into.i've been thinking an awful lot about this being a big fan of boba fett. i'm sure everybody who plays a game like eve is also a big fan. this is the problem. everybody wants to be a bounty hunter. everybody would want to be boba fett. so you have to cut down on the number of players fielding bounty hunters so the game doesn't just turn into one big bounty hunting game and everybody ends up with a bounty on his/her head.first of all, bounty hunting is not really about killing. it is about locating and turning into the authorities. assassination is about killing. so assassination could also be worked into the game as in a similar way as i will describe below.bounty hunting should not depend on the type of ship you fly. i like flying a frigate or a cruiser and i don't want to have to use a battleship just to kill a bounty because that bounty is always flying a battleship. i'd like to be able to fly my frigate and ""tag"" the bounty with a module that launches a tracking device that reports the ship's location to ded or concord. then that character would remain tagged for two days to a week and whenever they come into high sec, even if only in a pod, then concord would pop them.think about it. does boba fett go get a bigger ship in order to get his target? no. he stays in the slave i and turns his target in to jabba the hutt who paid for the bounty. however, bounty hunting is also not just about staying in a ship. boba fett needed to get out of his ship to get his target. so since incarna is on its way then bounty hunting that doesn't involve the player killing a player directly in a station can still allow the bounty hunting mechanics to work. bounty hunting that involves identifying and tagging the target for the proper authorities to deal with stays with the concept of walking in stations.the skills involved should be very time consuming to train. a player should have to dedicate his character to being a bounty hunter. just like mining. mining really is not fun or beneficial unless you train the skills way up and dedicate that character to mining rather than combat. different ranks of skills would allow for the bounty hunter character to locate targets in station via the ""station computer records"". just like a mix of locator agents and the trade mechanic the bounty hunter can gain access to station flight plans in order to locate a target in ever increasing range radiating out from the station he's at.having standings with an npc corp at a station would also affect the hunter's access to information. also, npc corps could issue bounties on players that fly into their systems with low standings and only hunters with high enough standings with that npc corp can take those bounties. standings could also add to the time intensity to being a bounty hunter. again, to force players to really have to dedicate a character to that and so not so many bounty hunters flying around.i think issuing bounties would work better if there was a legitimate reason to issue the bounty. i'd imagine it wouldn't be too hard to keep up with certain things that would validate a bounty. if a player steals from the corp hangar then that could be recorded and when a member of the corp places the bounty he can select the reason from a list and the game mechanics would be able to see that yes that player took stuff worth so much money and therefore a bounty of a certain amount based on the amount of the stuff stolen could be issued. if your ship was destroyed and you issue a bounty the game mechanics can see (this is already in the game) that a certain player did destroy your ship hence you have a real reason to issue a bounty.of course null sec would be a haven for those with bounties. that's the idea. you are forcing a player underground, restricting his movement."
11/16/2010,"there's a problem with polls though. put out a poll asking people to vote for whether or not they'd like 100 billion free isk an officer fit nyx and a pony, and a lot of people would say yes. doesn't mean that the game drastically needs everybody to be given a small horse."

11/16/2010,ok so ive been playing this game for over 5 years now and to this day i have been unable to get past the furst level of any complex due to the fact the rat that has the key is always deadevery single timeexmple i just logged on after dt and there was 3 people in local i jumped in to the complex rat dead key gone.look its redicules it makes it so that if i want to get a pith a type for instance i have to pay a redicules ammount of money for one why why why why!!! cant ccp make complex's instances with a cooldown so tht everyone has a chance to play them its not just the loot ive never been able to use this part of the game cos they are just farmed to death please guys raise this with ccp do somthing about it i just wanna play a complex (dungeon)tnx ajdeathgiver
11/16/2010,"despite the tears this man has a point. i've never been able to go past the first room in a complex because the rat containing the key has been killed hours previously and never respawns.fix, please. shouldn't be that hard for this.although on reflection i've just remembered i live in 0.0 and haven't tried to run a ded compound in probably a year or longer."
11/16/2010,"very true, these need to either be instanced or fixed in some way. its ridiculous that people can hang out in the complex harvest the key and destroy the gameplay in it for everyone. the rats in there respawn, so should the key."

11/16/2010,"op- i dont know who you are, nor do i care who you are, but i am pretty sure you are an idiot, and know nothing of software development or have ever read a dev blog."
11/16/2010,"well i never claimed to be involved with software development but i have read many dev blog's. i based my estimate on the 64 bit data base conversion timeframe which as far as my understanding goes was not a ""huge"" project. no need to be a **** about it, just let me know what you think about the proposal, not me. i don't care what you think about me."
11/16/2010,"a rollback of the codebase is not technically feasible, according to ccp.even someone like me, who has been known to make outrageous ""modest"" suggestions from time to time, doesn't have the anodized titanium nuts to suggest they do that, even if i thought it was a good idea (which i don't). after 35 year in the software biz, the mere thought of rolling back my own code more than a day produces prodigious and persistent palpitations.and you want 6 months? the poor bastards who greenlighted that decision would find themselves bound, gagged, loaded into an authentic longboat, doused in gasoline, launched into the nearest fjord, and given a traditional viking funeral. and that would be the lunchroom staff, giving them a quick and merciful death while the mob of outraged devs was distracted burning down ccp hq."
11/16/2010,"in my software development experience, rollbacks are for immediate reversion to a previous known working state--typically in response to a patch or something that utterly breaks critical functionality.you don't rollback software to versions of six months or two years ago or whatever. it is completely non-feasible from both a technical aspect and due to the impact on users.think about that impact for a minute. since it would be absolutely mind-bogglingly impossible to unravel all the interdepdencies and progress and gains and losses associated with player activity to cherry-pick the ones that ""matter"" and should be preserved, the only choice would be straightup rollback to an arbitrarily selected database state from the dominion timeframe. that means that everything players have worked hard to build since then--alliances, corporations, sovereignty, pos's, agent standings, pi (as **** as it is), etc.--would all revert to what it was (or wasn't, because much of it didn't even exist in dominion). everyone loses everything they have gained since dominion. that's just stupid, it is not possible to address that in a way that would satisfy the majority of players. subscriptions would plummet as people rage-quit.look, as wanting as eve is for iteration and polish of existing features, as unthrilled as some of us are about the direction ccp is taking it, as irritating as fleet lag is for some of you...you can still log in and have fun. the game works. maybe not as good as it could work or as we wish it would work, but it works. and lately--at least in some areas--there has been really good focus and progress on some areas of the game that are crying for it.seriously, a rollback to a game-state of months/years ago is a suggestion that can't even be taken seriously. not for something as humongous, ever-evolving, and interdependent as the eve universe."
11/16/2010,"caldari ships cause lag because of missiles apperantly , so they can't really make more missile ships and make lag worse can they."
11/16/2010,"i think what you are failing to realize is that everyone who flies minmatar, gallente, and amarr complain about how the best weapon/ships for pve are missile based and how they have to train this other weapon that they have no use for outside pve to maximize isk/hr. honestly, you should be happy that not only do you have the best pve ships, but also don't have much else to train to pvp fairly well. this is why there are so many people with caldari skills.if you were to complain about hybrids being the other weapon system for caldari and being pretty bad, i would accept that complaint. complaining about missiles not being an end all be all is a stretch."

11/17/2010,or will change dramiel dronbay from 15 to 0.
11/17/2010,"the dramiel needs a small nerf but only a small one. it needs it's drone bay removed, falloff bonus removed or speed cut by 10-15%. pick one and only one. some of the other faction ships are fine, some are not. the ashimmu, bhaalgorn, and entire serpentis/angel lines are wonderful ships. i wouldn't touch either as they represent exactly what the pirate faction ships should be. however the cruor and pretty much the entire sansha line need some love.the phantasm, for example, is a pure dps ship and yet it does less dps than the hac's it's supposed to be superior to. it needs a nice 50-75% damage boost over what it currently has. if it gets that, then suddenly it's a very appealing faction cruiser. as such, i would remove it's tracking bonus in favor of a double damage bonus. i would also add an additional turret to it (+2 effective turrets due to role bonus).the cruor suffers from silly bonuses. neuting bonuses are of no use on a frigate hull but the web bonus is great for a frigate. as such i suggest dropping the neut bonus in favor of a web range bonus. this would give it both a strength and range bonus to webs, a very powerful combo.i can't comment on guristas ships much but they seem to be very popular, so my guess is they are fine. as for those who think the ashimmu is crap, it's not crap, just different. it is not in direct competition with the pilgrim or the curse. it's a totally different beast and one that i like a lot. you could boost it's base speed/agility/hp and i wouldn't complain but it's bonuses are exceptionally powerful in the right hands. i wouldn't dare trade the web/neut amount bonus for a neut range bonus. nor would i trade one of them for a web range bonus. i have a cynabal, dramiel, bhaalgorn and tons of other shiny ships and yet i've run around in an ashimmu almost exclusively for the past month. that says something.edit: forgot to support."

11/17/2010,"summary the gameplay feature in null sec should be not limited to huge fleet combats only. but at the moment roaming fleets benefit not really much to the alliance, if it does that is probably kill some ratters and experience of combat.for realistic aspect, it is hard to image that a rogue fleet(s) intrude the system everyday but cause no loss to the vintim even no benefit for theirselves.solutions*option 1anomaly spawn from the system holder. there will be an anomaly spawns every 3 hours or more or any detailed time, depends on the military level. the anomaly will spawns a structure proteted by elite pirate frigates always. (the purpose for pirate frigates is to prevent the afk cloakers and the hit-and-run tactical)once the structure is dowm, the military level of the system will be decreased by a precentage(5%-8%)*option 2attackable ihub compounts. low hitpoints means easy to get incaped but easy to repair also. after the repairation there will be a reinforced timer to prevent repeating-attacks.the attackable ihub compounds will not be the current ones, but some new little bonus to the system which apply to.pros encourges people to fleet roaming and locals to fight with the enermies.consif the locals can't fight with the roaming fleet always then they will suffer from a lack of anomalies which will expand the gap between losers and winers.taking a system down may requires many stikes but ratting the military level back is fast and easy.constructive suggestions thank you i know it is far from a complete idea."
11/17/2010,"because roaming into enemy space with a dozen ships and ganking a jf, orca, ratting carrier, or a faction bs isn't enough?"
11/17/2010,"supported, guerrilla tactics should be encouraged mechanics wise."
11/17/2010,"going to start out with a link here to the previous thread this more or less continues and take a moment to laugh at virt who said this would never happen.anyways, the new ts mothership(i refuse to call these supercarriers because its a stupid ****ing name) seems uninspired. it has a lower ehp than a hel with the dps of a nyx and a jump range bonus that...leaves it able to almost jump what a carrier can but farther than anything else. i don't really see that bonus coming into any useful effect beyond getting further out of combat after an op and back to ratting asap. instead i propose giving it a titan esque bonus of +30% jump range to every capital and supercapital underneath your command slot in the fleet that shares your system when they initiate the jump. this would not only give it a role but would make sure that these fragile supercaps are actually used for more than anomalies. also they look ******ed but that can be handled another day."
11/17/2010,supported.
11/17/2010,i will support my own thread.
11/17/2010,"good idea, supported....should it also affect titan bridge range? i'm leaning towards no."
11/17/2010,i would also lean towards no. let's make the titans jump themselves forward
11/17/2010,dont think eve needs a direct boost to (super) capital hotdropping.
11/17/2010,supported.
11/17/2010,supporting a real fapital bonus.
11/17/2010,"pffft, fapitals are meant for sanctum farming. why would you use a drake fapital for anything else?[/sarcasm]"
11/17/2010,"i like the idea, a lot. anything that would cause them to actually be used is a good thing."
11/17/2010,"this is actually a pretty good idea.boosting the ability of supercap fleets to bounce around the galaxy annihilating everything in sight probably isn't a good move though, unless there's some further modifications to their abilities. restore a little balance between supercaps and regular caps first, and then it'd be an excellent modification."
11/17/2010,"<edit>nvm, i did some more research and i changed my mind."
11/17/2010,"if it happens, i will sell the jf."
11/17/2010,"thanks for the positive feed, lots of you like the idea of carriers in high sec.what will happen about the price of them in high sec ?ill gues they drop alot if you're allowed too buy them there."
11/17/2010,"neutral remote repping carriers in high sec. niceeee. no, thanks."
11/17/2010,lies. carriers get most like 50 shuttles at best. what you are thinking of is when they put tons of shuttles in a freighter; popped the freighter and smartbombed the shuttles.the only reason ccp is stopping capitals from coming to highsec is bigger bullies punishing smaller bullies. literally they dont want capitals to be used in highsec wars. hell highsec wars are scum enough... capitals can only improve the situation. infact moros camping stations in highsec would fix highsec wars immediately.supercaps have no business in highsec im sure everyone can agree. there's no real reason for plain caps being restricted anymore.the reason they got banned originally was because people could tank concord and gank people in highsec. that's fixed so lets get them back to highsec.
11/17/2010,"your right giving all the jita station campers 5-10 capital neutral logistics guys is a great idea..... really are you kidding me? hell 5 caps with 2 rr each is ..... what 15,000 every 5 seconds...... hisec would be the lamest place on earth"
11/17/2010,"a coil gun or guass cannon is a type of projectile accelerator that consists of one or more coils used as electromagnets in the configuration of a synchronous linear motor which accelerate a magnetic projectile to high velocity.a railgun is an entirely electrical gun that accelerates a conductive projectile along a pair of metal rails using the same principles as the homopolar motorthat said i actualy put forward a proposal to rename the prototype guass cannons so that the guass cannon could become its own weapon type.it would be cool however to be able to ""tune"" your shots. but the only real advantage rails have ( and its pretty small) is that they can deal any damage type lasers are pure em, thermal and projectils are kinetic/explosive. i would make it a standard set of 4 slugs with a modifyyable setting for the guns for range"
11/17/2010,"are you mad? hybrids have always been able to only deal kinetic and thermal. and projectiles, despite always dealing kinetic damage, can choose damage types (for example, they will always do kinetic, but they can also choose to do em/kin, em/exp/kin, etc.)"
11/17/2010,this is patently false. hybrids are easily the weakest weapon system in eve. they don't excel in any area except hitting a stationary target that is within 5km.
11/17/2010,and this is why we don't listen to you - because you have no idea what you're talking about.edit:emp ammo would like to have a word with you.
11/17/2010,"this seems like a fun idea. instead of different ammo ranges, put a slider next to guns that determines projectile speed by using more/less cap.more cap energy means more speed, which translates to more damage, but at the same time more recoil, ruining your optimal due to error. this would make them equivalent to lasers as far as choosing range goes.this doesn't help any with the main problem railguns have though. while their dps isn't that bad, the fact that they can outrange tachyons easily doesn't mean anything, due to 250km range limit and annoying probing mechanics."
11/17/2010,"op has a fairly good idea. shift to cap stable for a structure shoot. shift to high damage high cap for an alpha strike. considering all the things that can modify cap or hybrid damage, i kinda worry about the end result of such a mechanic. also, considering the current size of the overheat button, i worry about how tiny a slider for the guns would actually be."
11/17/2010,signed
11/17/2010,do this ccp! take this solution!
11/17/2010,"bad solution since it removes an important decision from the game.better solution:give every char after subscription around 2 mil of sp at his disposal. the owner of the char can decide then whether he would rather like to fly a fancy ship emidiately or invest the skill points in the learnings (you get 5/4 for 2 mil sp). but i bet people would still complain, since they would still have to make a decision and face the consequences."
11/17/2010,"i like your solution, but wouldn't it give instant skilled alts for a whole variety of things? for instance a market alt, freighter alt, or even cov ops alt would all be either trained or almost trained within the free points. combined with free trials it would give throwaway alt a whole new meaning. not to mention insta suic ganking trials.i think the idea is to make training faster and more accessible to new people, not provide infinite skilled alts."
11/17/2010,"not at all!that why i said ""give every char after subscription around 2 mil of sp at his disposal."" (on the sentece is maybe a bit f*** up :d )so the trial would still keep its purpose, you would still train with bonus on your trial and thus have the opportunity to try different things as a new player. however, after you swith to a paid account you would reveive those 2 mil sp as a welcome gift so to say. you could still create insta skilled traders, but not for free. the only difference to how it is now is that you don't have to wait for two months or to pay for a char transfer. however, to be honest i am happy with the system as it is right now. it is just, if they necesserily want to change the system, this would be the only viable way for me to do it. all other proposals i have read so far simply say: ""give me the learnings for free and reimburce me with the juicy sps i have invested so far in them, so i can fly the titan sooner."" its not like the people don't like the learnings, they just don't want to ""pay"" for them."
11/17/2010,"in theory, i agree with you. in practice, the current method of measuring player support is stupid and cumbersome enough as it is. we should be using an ideascale type site, that allows votes up/down. instead we're using these garbage forums and having people post comma-delimited numbers using up to 3 chars per account on the honor system.if ccp really cared what the players wanted, don't you think they could design a quick popup voting front-end in about two days? they do it for the csm election, how hard would it be to rejigger it to allow people to vote on proposals? not very.however, ccp doesn't really care what players want. they want to design space barbie and console games, and they're happy to take your money to fund that development while they let you vote on whether they should think about making black ops, eafs, afs, or field commands not totally worthless six months from now (pick one!)also, santa claus is your parents. they just eat the cookies and give you presents, and the guy at the mall whose lap you sat on is probably an alcoholic."
11/17/2010,a good compromise might be to re-open the locked older threads and request that all relevant parties involved with any implementation read the entire thread in good faith.i think that would be a good check and balance to a popularity contest and would probably head off some unforseen circumstances and unintended consequences at the very least.
11/17/2010,"this is simply false. the division in terms of ideas along these issues splits between players that want more sandbox and open pvp, and those that want more themepark and pve free from pvp. they are diametrically opposed and both will be interested in ""indirect changes"" as you put them. both will also look for changes that directly effect the other group. both are equal in terms of this form of voting.i don't support your idea, because the voting system is flawed to begin with, since many players, including many in the group you identify yourself with, have multiple accounts. also, there's very few non superficial changes that i think wouldn't have strong opposition, therefore giving negative votes real clout is a call to hold onto the status-quo. ultimately ccp needs to decide what's changed and what's not. they can serve us all best by making clear strong design choices, being upfront on why they make the choices they do and the direction they wish to take the game. ... not by counting votes."
11/17/2010,"ccp can easily eliminate most griefer decs by making highsec very fruitless and putting more isk into lowsec, as well as by adding more lowsec and making more entry points into highsec so that lowsec is safer.since highsec is noob space, if you're big enough or rich enough to be griefer decced then you're too big to remain in noob space.thus, i propose that ccp...+ make more lowsec systems, and increase the number of entrypoints from highsec to lowsec.+ nerf highsec missions again, possibly with a cap on highsec bounties.+ reduce or remove the cap on the number of wars that corporations can declare.+ increase lowsec rewards."
11/17/2010,awesome!/supported.although the second point needs to be stronger and go way further.
11/17/2010,having an incentive to get out of highsec if you really want to earn isk seems like a logical idea.
11/17/2010,"not supported.mainly because you encourage the use of a stick to get people out of where you don't want them and into where you do. presumably so you have more targets. stealth, i want more people to shoot, whine?!people don't go to low sec because they don't feel safe and can't effectively do pve which is a product of the people there.people don't go to null sec because if they try to establish themselves, they get stomped on by the alliances and it turns into a job rather than a game.the sole solution should be (and only needs to be):+ buff lowsec. change missions to require more pvp fits, change mission npcs to be more like sleeper npcs. add worthwhile features that only exist in lowsec (i'm not talking just level 5 missions and ore, but other stuff too). and add more routes into lowsec, so there's less chance of running into a gate camp.edit: there's far to much nerf this & nerf that in eve, and not enough buff this to make it worthwhile. if you continue to nerf everything, everything becomes rubbish, and nothing is worth doing."
11/17/2010,not supported.
11/17/2010,"i have to agree with sin. it's time to stop looking at what needs to be nerfed to get people to move, and start looking at what can be reasonably buffed to accomplish that goal.consider this:highsec, wh space, and nullsec are all, to a greater or lesser degree safer and more profitable than lowsec. so why the hell would anyone go there?the issue with lowsec isn't that people don't go there - the issue is thay have no reason to go there. nerfing high sec won't make them leave - they'll just adapt and make do, or they'll quit the game. you have to get them excited about going into lowsec. i'll be honest, the only reason i ever go to lowsec is because there's a shortcut to jita that runs through rancer. nothing else in lowsec interests me enough to put up with the risks of lowsec."
11/17/2010,"have to agree with skinsin on this one, not supported."
11/17/2010,"re-read and thought of it:personally i will agree to lure more people into low sec, and it will make eve a little more entertaining after all..."
11/17/2010,i honestly don't care about getting more people to lo but...bounties.high<<<<<<<<low<<<<nullthe ability for someone to be able to shoot you should factor into the reward hugely.
11/17/2010,i'm with buffing lowsec as well.. sure the 0.0 crowd will cry about it just like they did when bs rats were added to lowsec.. but more needs to be done.
11/17/2010,"not supported, high sec is nerfed enough, buff lowsec, not nerf high, if anything.there are a couple decent ideas like more entry points into lowsec, but overall i don't see anything ccp could do to make low anything other than a gate camper hangout."
11/17/2010,"not supported.once again - i have nothing against boosting low sec. as long high sec player dont get their style of play nerfed. taking fun from one group to give it to another will cost ccp player and doenst take into account that despite the pure pvp intention eve is no longer home of only hardcore pvp fans or pvp fans at all. i'd say war dec price should be raised to a amount which mirrors the wallets of the deccers and a variable fee for each ship taken down in high sec. as insurances are often a topic it is only logical that the value which is payed out by the insurance would be taken from the war deccers corp. mercs get payed like this - ""pay 100 misk for the wardec and replace me every ship...""oh and about the ""noob-space"". true noobs start there, but there are more advanced player there then you think. i saw loads of ex-null players who have ""retired"" to high-sec or experienced player who just dont want to go to low or null sec."
11/17/2010,"less stick, more carrot."
11/17/2010,"this proposal suffers from a lack of good understanding of what a grief dec actually does on a broader scale...as well, its the pitboss' sacred duty to cleanse the universe of carebears. wouldn't want to be mucking about in his fun"
11/17/2010,"i'm not proposing removing level 4 missions. the only change would be that people would get less isk for killing highsec npc's.since the content would remain exactly the same, nobody's play style will get nerfed. they'll just get less isk for missioning in highsec."
11/17/2010,"you obviously haven't spent much time in low/null sec then. i'm part of a nul sec alliance and the mear mention of any ship withing 30 jumps of are home systems causes a froth of hunting gangs that corner them and reduce them to constituent atoms. the main point of this post is being able to do something to protect your smaller ships once your caught, saying you shouldn't have been caught is not a smart argument , as every none consensual pvp pirate will agree to, as they find plenty. please refraim from posting any more use a scout posts as they are not constructive to the idea."
11/17/2010,"this is the assembly hall not features and ideas discussion forum.if you come here without a well thought through proposal , expect to have it shot down in flames.the problem with this proposal is you are requesting very powerful options/modules based on a specific scenario ( escorting vulnerable ships ) without any consideration such modules/options would have on the other 98% of eve gameplay.there are allready plenty of ways of moving goods safelly even in null sec.do we really need the devs spending huge amounts of development time on yet another ?"
11/17/2010,"i'm in the same alliance as you. i've also been in null sec for longer than your character has existed.your comment about a ship being within 30 jumps leads to everyone running out to kill them is because we are in the nc. nc space is not the same as any other part of null sec.neuts bringing haulers through nc space are committing suicide. nc pilots, on the other hand, regularly fly their haulers around nc space unprotected. we have caps, cyno alts, titan bridges, and jump bridges for a reason. in low sec, if you are in a cloaky hauler, you shouldn't die. ever.i'm also a freighter pilot. hauling ihubs and fuel around null is fairly safe with proper alliance support (read titans and scouts).usually, when we catch ships and kill them, they are flying alone. i've only once seen an escorted hauler fleet die and that's only because we hot dropped them.i really, really don't like collision damage. i've been in blobs in eve long enough to know that idea would go bad fast."
11/17/2010,"from my perspektive, if someone uses bots to sell the isk for real money, ccp sometimes finds them, they ban them and remove the isk from the game.but, if you run a bot in a remote 0.0 system and use the isk only for yourself ccp does nothing. even if you report them on multiple days for the same reason. they still are online every day, flying from belt to belt all the time.the only 2 reasons i see:1. ccp only bans bots involved in rtm, because it allowes poeple to pull money out of the game. other bot doesn't decrease the profit of ccp.2. i only can't see them be banned, because ccp doesn't tell anyone. also the dev-blogs talkt most of the time about rmt-bots.greetings hyperzerg"
11/17/2010,bot-usage (macroing through outside programs) is a ban-able offense already...ffs keep your whine-posts out of ah.

11/17/2010,"chapter 7 section a subsection 3, specifically restricted content (eve online eula)as i said, its right there in the eula."
11/17/2010,i can rat faster than a bot raven
11/17/2010,"thats great, can you do it for 23 hours without pause for the next 2 years on 4 accounts?"
11/17/2010,"in so far as low sec is an arid wasteland of piracy where people stay only for the shortest amount of time possible, and usually on their way to somewhere else (unless they are setting omg pwnz0r peeveepee gatecamps), and there is no realistic way to change the situation and make these spaces useful for anything (boosting rats/missions/etc? good luck, these are activities the masses need some kind of protection to do). and where for a long time it has seemed to be an interest of ccp and lowsec denizens to attract more people to their lovely lands, i propose this innovative solution:get rid of lowsec altogether.why?1. no good way to populate it, if you nerf high sec, people will quit playing, not develop a sudden interest in getting ganked.2. not enough points of entry (generally there are chokeholds where the aforementioned camps are ran for fun and profit and empty space everywhere but)3. this dearth of population in potentially very interesting areas (the rancer pipe for example) scream of wasted potential.how to fix?my proposal involves a few things:1. players tend to either hang in concord space, or claimable space, thus make low sec into either. this is, either concord on everything but 0.0, or make everything 0.4 and down claimable.2. add access points and jumps to connect more systems with nullsec, minimizing the current chokeholds and providing alternate routes.3. make pos's in claimable space less than 0.5 but more than 0.0 be not discriminatory in docking rights, but providing taxes and docking fees (of a reasonable amount to prevent removal of docking rights via lol 300 mill fees) to sov holding alliance (providing an incentive to hold these lands).4. everything else in lowsec stays about the same, except perhaps increasing mission payout and bounties, with a % going to sov holder. no moons are created in these places, however.result:give a better transition for players between concord and sov territory, encouraging landowners in important pipes like rancer to provide protection for neutrals, and creating a use and potential for the vast amounts of space that are currently nothing but gate camp playgrounds where people only usually go by autopilot accidents.also, put interesting high stake wars in more easily accessible places for the new and newish players to experience, while creating new business opportunities for established alliances and players. (via supplying/protecting/pirating the newly interesting lowsec)tldr: sov in lowsec, taxes for holding alliance, more lowsec/highsec connecting systems, higher mission and ratting payouts in lowsec than now."
11/17/2010,low sec wont ever disappear... there's 2 thing which need to change to fix low sec.1. remove gate guns replace with system wide concord npcs who do more or less same dps but are destructible and no ewar. this gives some security to lowsec beyond stations and gates.2. create anti-pirate incentive: my suggestion is faction warfare mechanics for pirate vs anti-pirate. bringing anti-pirates to lowsec creates incentive for pirates.this does one major thing. pirates cant sit around all day on empire gates and get away with it. which really bring non-pirate/anti-pirates to the space.
11/17/2010,"1 is covered in the ""make it claimeable"" proposal, with the idea that this will encourage sov holder to provide protection making this be done by players and not npc's, but i agree with the idea: there must be some protection, and gate guns are pointless garbage.i like the idea for anti pirate fw, maybe a concord faction for lp towards concord ships? the concord cruiser is beautiful and its a shame we can't fly it. anti pirate fw would give a incentive for people to hang out in low, but doesn't really address camps though.also, supporting my own proposal."
11/17/2010,"sov will make it 100 times worse, the only lo sec systems that will be claimed will be by the big 0.0 powers.you thought a battlecruiser sitting on a gate was bad try a super carrier. it would just increase the blob out of null sec and ruin small gang piracy.low sec isn't perfect but it is wild space, with no bubbles and using the map function you can navigate it fine. this would be a bigger excuse not to go down there."
11/17/2010,"no, i don't think that caps or super caps should be allowed over 0.0, and i apologize if the proposal is unclear on this. although 0.1 to 0.4 would be claimable, the idea is for players to provide concord like services for them. this is also why no moons should be created here, or other null sec mechanics brought in: the profit should be in encouraging people to use the systems (not only those in your own alliance, via taxation), and not so much on just holding them.so there would be no super carriers, but perhaps sov holder fleets guarding gates and roaming to make sure no shennanigans happen and or warping to gankings. you know, player provided security.by not being too profitable compared to actual null, small/medium alliances may claim these systems, also giving easier intro to holding territory and spreading it to more players.finally, it creates a market incentive to run good systems: if you don't, people will use other, better protected low sec systems, encouraging effective protection, since it would be tied to profits."
11/17/2010,"supported.low sec needs some sort of security, right now its less secure than null. gate guns don't do anything."
11/17/2010,thats the ideal but the chances of that are slim to none. they would just turn around and shoot anything that moves. if penalties for this are put in they will have the sov holder be an alt and continue anyway.there are a ton of pirates who would abuse the mechanic for there gain instead of providing protection and that will continue as long as killmails hold value of anykind. the people who want the protection are just not around in the numbers or willing to provide the support.killmails are just worth to much as a commodity to make it valuable.
11/17/2010,i do not support your idea but i do think low sec needs a makeover. i think some parts need to become npc space without npc mission/high true sec. something like syndicate. everyone can dock its the same as lowsec clusters now
11/17/2010,"well, in my view the market would ensure that things change: if there is an incentive to providing security and you want that incentive, you have to do at least as good a job of providing it as the neighbors. and with no jump bridges, capitals, or other 0.0 mechanics, people would actually have to hang in these systems and actively guard them, thus encouraging active participation.but lets say this doesn't happen and people just harvest killmails even though holding the system and making it functional to mission/rat in is more valuable: well, then things stay about what they are now. and it is my belief that at least in some places, things would change for the better.there really is no way to abuse the mechanic, especially if updates are provided (even via the news blurbs at logion) of what lowsec systems are safer, as people would gravitate there, and away from noob killmail farms, as they do now."
11/17/2010,except the issue that null sec ratting and anoms are so much more valuable. so for the low low price of setting a pirate corp to blue thay can effectivly shut down the gate. meanwhile any group that wishes to create an effort to dislodge the pirates will be blobed out of existance by the null sec'ers. our corp even now has a similar deal with a few lo sec corps which allows us to travel a dangerous pipe without resistance. you can bet that most lo sec regions will begin to operate this way shutting down many of the pipelines making even harder for new corps to enter null. any money they could make from taxes would be more then easily off set by the massive ammount of isk flowing out of null sec.all in all it will make gate camping much worse and make getting a foothold in sov even harder.
11/17/2010,"nice troll. not supported, low sec is just fine. i've lived there 2 years and have no intention of leaving. also, there are tons of entry points. the real choke points are to null sec, though amazingly about half of those are directly from high sec to null sec. that's not to say low sec is perfect, it could use some tweaking but the basic mechanics are good. if you think it's a barren wasteland, take a look in hophib (lvl4's), amamake (arena), egghelende (arena), auga (fw), sahtogas (lvl5's), aschee (lvl5's), kamela (fw), houla (fw), tama (fw)... get the idea? there are tons of low sec systems with very large populations. most of low sec is devoid of life, but it's the same with null sec and even much of high sec.low sec need not be removed, it needs to be expanded. we need more fw navies to join. i'd love to join the blood raiders, that should be added. the minor empires as well like ammatar mandate and thukkar tribe. these are just some basic ideas and they don't delete the game for large numbers of players. your proposal is about as likely to happen (and rational) as me requesting the deletion of non-npc null sec."
11/17/2010,"mission rewards, bounties, insurance and overseer personal effects. i believe adding new isk to the overall system of eve is bad. it devalues it, in some way. some isk disappears such as buying/trading npc goods, skill books, clone costs, paying for insurance, sovereignity costs etc. modules, ships & moon materials only add items that are paid for with isk etc. its the isk that is the problem.there are other isk sinks such as players leaving although players returning can also be an isk faucet.there should be steps taken to destroy sources and eliminate isk accumulation.could such measures include removing overseer effects, making some missions require a bigger fee so if you fail a mission you lose millions, remove npc trading, remove insurance entirely from the game and reduce/remove rat bounties so only the items/salvage are the reward. make plexes able to be destroyed more easily? what could be done to reduce isk entering the game?"
11/17/2010,"well, since ccp really seems to want microtransactions, have them use isk instead of plex.how about changing facelifts for plex to facelifts for isk? maybe adding name changes for isk (this would need to be recorded on a character history) or other non-game affecting (mostly) thinggs for isk (not plex)."
11/17/2010,"the big disadvantage of the client is a huge number of windows needed to solve various problems.on other hand not all of windows are needed at the same moment. for example, while scanning one of the windows needed to trade in jita - others, etc.my suggestion - save the settings of windows layout and the ability to quickly switch between them.to this end, in each of the saved settings are stored position ui elements and their status.the switch can be added to the neocom and give the power to assign keyboard shortcut."
11/17/2010,basically virtual desktops.
11/17/2010,i proposed this exact thing a while back and i think it would be a great improvement over the current cluster-f*ck of ui windows there are right now.
11/17/2010,"actually you have it backwards. as the star moves toward you the frequency of the light wave increases, which is a blue shift. anyway, not that it matters, but in warp, normal spectral light would be at such high frequency we woe not be able to see it. it would be a total blackout... or the ship would glow from the intense bombardment of high energy collisions. glad it's just a game."
11/17/2010,"no thats corect. the red shift is what happens when you have a high frequecy of light not a high wavelength. the blue shift happens wen the frequency lowers thus when relitave speed comes in to playsay for instance :o===================*==================osun#1 you sun#2sun 1 and sun two have the same chromatic value of say green for instance (dont ask me how a sun can operate with such a high copper content)with a visual specturm exactly the same and the output exactly the same.as you approach the speed of light towards the direction of sun 1 the wavelength is compressed thus givving the illusion that the frequency has increased.thus turning red while the wavelength of sun#2 has elongated. givign the illusion that the frequency has lowered. thus turning blue due to the time that it takes to complete a single cycle in the frequency.while i would agree that it woudl look pretty bad visualy. to make it entirley factual where warp eventualy turns you in to a hadron colider particle. and every thing behind you is black and every thing in front of you is white, i just think it woudl be a little more comforting to see the warp bubble switched to make a little more sense."
11/17/2010,"no. it's correct as it is: it would appear bluer at the front, and redder behind. it's you who has it backwards.to those who claim i am wrong, look it up. or if you're absolutely too lazy to bring yourselves to do it, i'll post a link or something."
11/17/2010,"ah yeas like i said before my science and space knowledge is wrong, i did do a look up on the ""red shifting"" subject and what you say is corect moving away form something makes it red, and movign twoards makes it blue. i concede that now, thank you for bringing that to my attention.heres the proof he's right guys."
11/17/2010,"nope.. ull be running into light that had already left the star a long time ago so looking behind u while in warp would mean ur technically looking back in time. but im sure we all knew that.thinking there'd be no light at all behind you would mean uve only considered the light thats left to reach u at the time ur warping around, and not all the light present and flying around prior to you warping all over the place... bt yahh as u said.. its only a game after all.i vote for seeing giant pink space elephants when warping around to add to the fantasy that im playing a game and not participating in real life. :p"
11/17/2010,"if you read the back stories you will find somewhere ( cant remember where ) that once you are in warp you are actually inside a total vacuum warp bubble.that means no mass inside the bubble ( except you ) , no enery either of any sort.no em radiation , no vacuum energy , nothing.the fact that you can still see is due to the fact that the pod computer generates a vr image for your brain.no need for red shifts / blue shifts.and btw go read your science books again because.heading towards something = higher frequency = blue shiftheading away from something = lower frequency = red shift.allways believe everything you read on wiki"
11/17/2010,bring back classic red shift! this current excuse for an effect is bad.
11/17/2010,ok how about they make eve silent cause there is actually no noise in space in rl.
11/17/2010,<obligatory>eve has sound?</obligatory>
11/17/2010,i just wish these tunnels generated a visible effect. not necessarily as obvious but ala babylon 5 would be nice.
11/17/2010,part from the fact there is sound in space... duh!sound leaps across a vacuum after all!
11/17/2010,"proposal : log off all characters after 1 hour of player inactivity (a minimum of one keyboard command sent to server?)pros:- emphasizes that ships/characters dont work without players, consistent with the anti-botting rules- incremental reduction in ccp variable expenses even if only saving the expense of sending chat information, market update information, etc. even 1/4 of one percent improvement in those incremental costs might mean the ability to hire an additional contract employee for 6 months. small improvements are not useless.- moderates angst: slightly moderates certain grievances that give some players a distaste for the game because of percieved inbalance and rl principles of what is model competitive play while, at the same time.allowing existing afk tactics to be used by players not completely absent. cons:- eliminates an existing game mechanic (intended or not) that has been adopted as a tactical tool in terms of surprise and psychological war-fare. - people may want to have a recent chat/fleet history to returnd to when the return to play after a few hour break and this would prevent that- creates a hardship for some players who might have many clients open or be tabbed out of the game and forces them through the tedious process of logging back in if they forget to check in once an hour.- might give another advantage to cheaters with technical know-how to fake a player at the keyboard response."
11/17/2010,"this will also hurt people who are providing covert surveillance of stargates or jump bridges. we'll be on voice comms for a long period, and being logged out after an hour of watching the gate simply because all communications were happening outside the game doesn't seem like a fair cop to me."
11/17/2010,no.
11/17/2010,hell no!
11/17/2010,"1. first of all, why would u think macros/bots can't make keyboard strokes? fyi, programs don't have to physically hit the keys to do so.2. hardly worth implementing when it all boils down to afk-cloak whining.3. ""competitive""? this isn't world of warcraft, where lines r drawn and matches r controlled. this is eve, aka cat and mouse, baiting, and above all, terrorizing your victims no matter where/who/how many they hide behind.if u can't even handle the thought of someone who can't even hurt u, then wow is that way..."
11/17/2010,this is an absolutely awful idea

11/17/2010,i like this.
11/17/2010,was looking for a skill to train and started to bite the bullet on doomsday operation 5 and noticed that it requires energy pulse weapons. the thing has been not aoe for over a year. as an easy fix maybe remove energy pulse weapons (smartbomb skill) since the dd is not a massive super smartie any more.
11/17/2010,"after a bit of thinking, how about this:1.remove energy pulse weapons from doomsday operation. 2.make it so doomsdays require the racial capital weapon at v (i.e. judgement needs capital energy turret v, ragnarok capital projectile, leviathan citadel cruise, erebus capital hybrid).this will increase the training time for people to gain access to a titan, but shouldn't affect current pilots.so supported only if another prequisitry is added."
11/17/2010,there is nothing wrong with the doomsday prerequ
11/17/2010,you are really sure that loosing e.g. amarr cruiser 4 wouldnt lock out amarr bs aswell?

11/17/2010,this is a great idea.
11/17/2010,how much sec gain per plex?i can't see this abused at all.

11/17/2010,"a lot of these nay-sayers have pretty weak arguements against imho. but there is a lot of negativity.perhaps a low-impact solution; rather than outright buying standings or security status indefinately, there can be some restrictions:- only being able to ""reset"" standings or security status -- ie to 0.- being limited to how often it can be done, ie 6/12 month intervals.- harsher sec/standings penalties if you pirate after buying back your sec/standings (ie, pirate resets sec status to 0; goes off and suicide ganks a hulk within the 6/12 month cooldown period; gets double the sec status drop; has to pay double the amount to get it back to 0)with certain restrictions in place there shouldn't be any problem; even so i don't really foresee pirates willing to spend billions of isk a month just to keep himself in highsec -- this solution is more for the casual gamer like myself who may find himself wanting to increase his sec status without having to spend weeks changing his entire gameplay to do it."
11/17/2010,you can edit your postnot supported for this reason.
11/17/2010,"let's think this through:it would take about 12-13 t2 fit battleships to do this first of all. so that's about 1.5+ billion isk down the drain. then there's the cost of plex for each pilot -- another 4.5 billion or so.so if you're up to spending 6+ billion isk every few days to gank some freighters then by all means, please inject this into the economy and drive down plex prices."

11/17/2010,"i think all that there is to say has probably already been said, but still;accepting the ""caldari for pve, amarr for face melting, gallente for mwd'ing then exploding ect."" ethos does more to homogenise the field of play than anything. when someone questions nullsec pvp crystalising into drake+scimi/zealot+guardian encounters, or vagabonds and dramiels becoming the dominant force in small man skirmishes, the first answer should not be ""lol crosstrain then you scruuuuuuuubs""; ccp should be constantly striving to balance the game, as otherwise it marginalises a massive portion of possible ships and fits, (as well as the players who put the sp into using them) thus destroying the rationale of ""each ship is situational"" when clearly some situations are far more likely to happen than others. there's simply no debate to whether level 5 in amarr battleships is currently more valuable than level 5 in gallente battleships. obviously factions shouldn't get carbon copies of eachother's ships, but there should always be atleast a one ship per faction per general situation without being too much of an obvious weakness to your fleet or just plainly being too innefective to be there (hi there brutix/ferox/hyperion/eagle/deimos/oneiros/basilisk/ect.). it isn't just a caldari thing though(i personally think we're fine on having all the bases covered, and torps can be used with all bombers too btw), there's serious issues with destroyers as a whole class, electronic attack ships as a whole class, hybrid guns and lets be honest, gallente ships in general. it's really just endemic to the balance situation as a whole."

11/18/2010,"because someone at csm didnt do their jobthis thread/issue can be found somwhere on the csm wiki and minutes(i am too lazy to link it now)but if you read that you see that the csm member said that blasters need more range, and pointed to this threadmost of the csm disagreed that they need more range, so the issue was abandoned, and i agree with them, boosting range is not the answer, then blasters would just be the same as ac and lasersi am, like you amazed that noone in csm read the whole thread and that noone raised another issue about it"

11/18/2010,"i'm not supporting this, but on a technicality.what we need is not dramiel balance, but universal balance. i want to see a large scale attempt at rebalancing every ship in the eve universe. the problem is, this would be an enormous job, and the question would primarily be ""where the hell do we start"".think bigger."

11/18/2010,instead of 3 range groups like projectiles how about just 2 range groups: short (-50%) and long (+60%)?
11/18/2010,"one of eve's challenges is to find a connection to people you're fighting against, while in battle. since the ships are miles away, they aren't exactly right in front of you unless you do a ""look-at"" or happen to be flying close to them.a great way to increase the level of immersion and player ""uniqueness"" is to display the actual ship, instead of a static icon. each ship that's targeted, displays as if you were ""looking at"" them, from the direction of your ship. any custom ships (if they give us custom paint or decals in the future) would show up. also give us a ""quick expand"" button that quickly expands one target to a larger window, showing the targeted ship as it's flying around, and the player who's flying it.also, when the ship blows up, the target should stay there briefly while the explosion lasts at least, until the debris shows up. it would help make battles much more fun i think. obviously all of these new options could be turned off if the user wants."
11/18/2010,i like this.

11/18/2010,i like it.
11/18/2010,or rotate the module so you can see the entire model like a heads up display on a real starship (showing weaknesses and other things about the ship you are shooting).
11/18/2010,"yes, or at the very least an icon which communicates the class of the ship. i can barely tell the difference between a titan icon and a drone icon.edit: i misunderstood the purpose of this, but i support it anyway."
11/18/2010,"yup. i could see the 3d aspect possibly adding client preformance problems, but it could always be an option to toggle it on or off. and a sencond +1 to a way to tell what class, frig criser, etc, it is."

11/18/2010,sounds logical.perhaps you should propose numbers though. perhaps there should be different quality repair stations that repair it better or worse changing the life expectancy?
11/18/2010,very no.this idea is bad and you should feel bad.
11/18/2010,not supported.i don't want to have to buy a new ship after (for example) 60 days because it aged and is thus less effective.
11/18/2010,"terrible idea. this would literally kill 0.0. every ""so often"" you would have to completely replace dozens upon dozens of infrastructure and csaa pos including the csaa itself which costs billions to replace. not to mention supercaps would eventually have to be replaced. this would be an incredible bane on all but the richest eve players. i happen to be one of those rich ones so this wouldn't really hurt me beyond the annoyance of producing ship after ship that takes months to build nearly endlessly to keep the one im using ""repaired"" but it would destroy the eve economy"
11/18/2010,"if you dont use the ship, it shouldnt age. the timer only should count while you are using it.maybe a counter who counts how many hits you got or anything what dont cause lag.of course people wont like the idea, to buy a new ship after a while using it. nobody likes that really. nobody wants to become older in real life, too. we love the idea of being undestructable, immortal, never losing anything because of aging, cumulate isk easily... .. just it doesnt work that way. economy needs aging, thats why mother nature let you die after a reasonable time to free up place for something new.and of course, small tech i ships are aging faster then big expensive or tech ii or tech iii ships. its all matter of numbers, scaleable.of course you can repair ships, but every time you need a repair, the ship looses a bit of its shinyness and becomes older. you can still use it, repair it again and again... but one day you want a new one."
11/18/2010,so you want to present a concept to put into the game that even you yourself admit no one wants for...what?
11/18/2010,trolling and attention whoring? that's my theory anyway.
11/18/2010,"back in my day, we didn't have fancy-schmancy ""warp drives"" or ""jump gates."" i remember when i had to travel from amarr to jita up-hill both ways, in the snow, with nothing but a snickers bar and a...okay, seriously, just no."
11/18/2010,"my proposal will solve lots of problems eve has now. there will be a logical and fair isk sink. the more you have, the richer you are the more isk you will have to pay, so noobs without isk wouldnt get a big drawback, because the cost for the aging of eg. a rifter would be marginal and affordable.pvp player who often loose their ships anyway, wouldnt feel bad with aging.but players with fully overpimped ships cant fly their marauders or supercapital forever. just an example: i am playing eve for many years now. i have one faction fitted marauder, which i am flying now for more then 3 years. i can do level iv missions with this ship with marginal isk. even when i fall asleep during a mission, the tank saves me and it happened that i warped back to a station with 5% in hull, burning .. i just press the repair button and my ship is brandnew again. i have the feeling that this is wrong.aging will boost market and i am pretty sure, builders and industrials gonna like that idea. its an isk and mineral sink, the eve economy really needs."
11/18/2010,"no, the eve economy doesn't need this. when there is hyper inflation (there isn't any now), then say that it needs something like this. but still not this because aging is the worst concept of this type you could bring into the game.if you take a look at markets, most things sell at very little profit over their production cost, and inflation on most things (other than plex) is minimal.eve has an excellent system for stabilizing market prices, its called ""station traders"". and an excellent isk sink: ""people who hoard their isk"". sure, it doesn't get rid of the isk for good, but it does take it out of the system. since eve is limited by skill points in which ships one can fly, regardless of wealth, even the very rich have a very strict limit on how much of that wealth they can use for anything practical anyway.this means that traders already keep isk out of the system and prices low, and thus even though the amount of isk is expanding, its not creating pretty much any problems.your proposal would destroy accumulated wealth for no practical benefit and effective detriment: people would quit en masse.so very no."
11/18/2010,"do you have a screenie of the ship's info card from the test server? just like to look it over to see its full profile before voting yes or no. also, lazy."
11/18/2010,"nice writeup and great idea. ccp already stole your idea the first time around, ed, so they should totally steal this one, too. totally supported."

11/18/2010,yes!
11/18/2010,"/supportedroles and right management really really need a lot more love.pos management like this would be a start, still there is much more to fix on that painful issue."
11/18/2010,nice idea.
11/18/2010,"missed by a lot!first, 30k veld per minute is around 3000m3/min, on a dread you can get a max around 500m3/min so lower your number 6 times, that's 66m/day then, currently the price of veld is less than 70 isk/m so your number of 292k isk per minute (based on 3000m/min) should be 210k isk/min that means lowering the final nomber by another 20%so... 500m * 70isk * 60 minutes * 23 hours = 48m/dayalso like you said yourself, cargohold got nerfed, so you have 5 times less cargo than a hulk, wich means you have to warp 5 times more often, so you cant afk without a bot (wich is against eula), and also you warp around a lot slower than a hulk, so you would loose a lot of time.. about chribba, i dont know, a lot of changes were made in the last years, i dont think he mines any moreand back on topic:neutral rr carrier... ****... i didnt think of that, that's a valid reason not to have them in hisec, atleast untill neutral rr agression and docking games are changedso untill then i withdraw my support"
11/18/2010,bear in mind that [properly fit] carriers typically field between 600k to 1 mil ehp and can locally rep about 500 to 1000 dps a second... even if the aggression mechanics behind rring were changed it wouldn't change much for carriers.
11/18/2010,"i like this idea, and i believe i can push it one step further:also include the ability to increase cap usage to increase tracking, and vice-versa. that would absolutely give hybrids a clear niche to work within. by being able to increase tracking and/or range without mods--and working even better with them--you have highly viable guns with a meaningful and balanced drawback, i.e. you can't fire your guns if you don't have the cap (and ammo of course)."
11/18/2010,"supported. it would be sweet if it was done like t3 guns were supposed to be done and given scripts to modify them on the fly. it fits well for gallente to because they are often considered the jack of all trades, master of none race. caldari sortof is to."
11/18/2010,this would be a welcome change that will break the monotony of combat.supported.
11/18/2010,"so ram up to full cap usage for a hideous alpha then be cap dead for the rest of the fight (which would actually make llente ships useful as alpha snipers or for rr pos shoots as they would do much more damage for the number of hybrid charges included), or settle in for the long haul chipping paint off the other ships but being able to tank.interesting proposal.orr... how else would this mechanic work?introducing tracking scripts or having some kind of doubled up slot (ammo+a script) might overcomplicate things. same thing with other proposals.. but i do like the idea of hybrids having a slidey scale instead of just a 25%-50%-75% script. that might give them a bit more flavor vs. the other weapons whose modifiers are fitted into very discrete objects."
11/18/2010,"heh, i want to use 11"
11/18/2010,god yes please!!!
11/18/2010,"i know, right?please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
11/18/2010,yeah but how many people joining the game would know about this thing after sub? none probably so they would still be stuck in this learning skill thingy where they would quit the game before they subcribed which would make your idea useless. this topic is trying to make it so new players can enjoy the game without haveing to go through a bunch of waiting first.
11/18/2010,"yes and no... yes in that the option to vote yes on a negative effect may be available. there are several items on the list for this round of voting that do not have negative direct interaction counters available to vote for. therefore, your assumption is false.no in that being able to vote no on an issue will be a powerful balancing tool to prevent indirect actionists (pve players) from proposing a negative direct interaction idea."
11/18/2010,"i do agree that lowsec mechanics fix is in order, increasing the payout for level vs or offering even better quality agents in low sec, but nerfing high sec is not going to substantially increase the chances of more people in low sec. if anything, itll make the vast majority ****ed off (80% of eve live in high sec?).nevertheless, this will not be supported for the original purposes of the op, because griefers will only continue to grief because they can. this will only make it easier for wardecers to find easier prey. this does not solve the problem. and asking griefers to ""play nice"" will only just make them work harder for the delicious tears of newbletts."
11/18/2010,"people don't go to low sec because there isn't enough incentive?! really?!?no, people don't go to low sec because it's become a tear wrangling, shoot on site **** hole. even pirates are leaving low sec nowadays. it's what actually happens when you give a large group of players an area to freely kill whoever they want with almost no consequence.first it becomes a slaughter house, then it becomes a wasteland. what ccp needs to eliminate isn't griefer decs, its low sec. take what is now low sec and split it up between empire space and null sec. then, open pvp arenas through high sec where people who want to fight can go to fight without all the smart bomb gate camping and pretend pirates that have made low sec the tumbleweed headquarters of new eden.or, you know, whatever. i don't actually care but i thought i'd just give my worthless two sense regardless. party on capsuleers."
11/18/2010,"/not supportedhighsec already is nerfed enough. there are people here who like to play the game more peacefully. thats what high sec is for.in fact i would like to get rid of -10 people, even if they are in a pod.they should get shot by concord instantly."
11/18/2010,"what bliss it must be, when you run around with such an ignorance. getting less isk out of lvl 4 is as much a nerf as taking away lvl 4 and put them into low sec. to earn as much you would need to go to low sec, therefore my playstyle would be nerfed. the same thing happened already to miner. when you could earn about 10 misk/hr in high sec two years ago its now far less, combined with favoring ganker in highsec."
11/18/2010,"not supported.does nothing to address griefer decs, artificially tries to populate a space that people aren't interested in by destroying one in which they are.this solves no problems, and creates quite a few."
11/18/2010,"everyone knows there is a ton of macro-ratting, macro-mining, and courier botnetting in this game. ccp doesn't do anything unless they link the account to rmt.and it sucks. i don't want to have to compete with automated programs.does anyone else remember reading about the game and about, say, mining and thinking that it would be lucrative and important, that there would be escorts for mining ops in dangerous territory? it's basically for afkers and botters, and as such, it's unimportant and unlucrative.i don't understand the previous responses. yes, it's against the eula, and yes, ccp *can* ban people for botting, but they obviously don't. go to ingunn and count the bestowers piloted by laura4398 and fred78927laksjd.supported."
11/18/2010,"1) typically a proposal is in the form of ""this is what's wrong/what i think might be cool. this is what should be done"" not ""wah wah wah i don't read eulas nor know how to use a search function so i want the csm to hold my hand wah wah""2) enforcement of the eula is solely ccp + the gm's domain, the csm has no oversight into this. yeah, we can complain about it (again, search function, this has been brought up before), but its up to ccp to actually enforce their own rules...or have the gm's actually play the friggin' game so they know whats actually going on and understand game mechanics"
11/18/2010,yeah this topic is retarted even if csm approved this or whatever they could never actually make the ******s over in ccp actually do anything its up to ccp alone. go make a petition or something oh wait ive done that several times about different things and they do nothing.
11/18/2010,"supported.capsuleer is a great utility. it's for me a part of what eve online is intrinsically, and to see it go to trash is seen (for me) as the destruction of a corporation you played in for two years. it hurts. basically i think it is a real shame to let it go.please find solutions to maintain it."
11/18/2010,"i'm with the op, though i'd personally like to see low sec become pirate faction space, held by sansha, angel and the like. in this space, you would have to pay the faction patrols to enter or leave their space as well as for protection from rogue pvp'rs. players with low empire standings could go there and enlist with say, the sansha, to fly as part of their patrols and get paid to fly as protection for transports and mining ops.think of it as a wild pirate version of high sec where the concord is a mix of npc and player groups that get paid up front for services."
11/18/2010,"this is what i proposed in another thread:the core problem with low sec is that ccp has allowed it to become infested with pirates, who rarely suffer for their criminal actions. sec loss is all too easily done, and npcs don't react fast enough or pod pirates for it to ultimately matter to these players if they need to travel to high sec."
11/18/2010,"i agreei'll put it slightly differently while saying the same thing roughly . i'd like to see low-sec go even lower-sec.. eliminaate concord's presence there and get rid of the sec status hits. basically make it npc 0.0 without bubbles or bombs. i like bubbles and bombs just fine in 0.0 ... its just another flavor and allows a few different options in fleet size and make-upit would be interesting if there was a way for people to install some sort of lower tech jump bridges without sovereignity. maybe one node per account link-able to another player with mutual assent?those player (not corporation) jump bridges could be a way to lure a few more players in with a method of safe transit... perhaps a business of tolls for jump rights and safe pos access by fee.so, make it more dangerous for lack of concord, but more managable to avoid attack...capital combat without bubbles? (and ban super-caps ) idk.. basically the contes"
11/18/2010,"do you remember when faction warfare came out at first? it was truly fun. you could log on and get in a fight within minutes. you could control the size of the ship that faced you. i remember intel being posted on a pirate gate camp and a fleet of disorganized individuals descending on that gate in mass to break it up. there are too many cool things that could be done with low sec. just off the top of my head:corruption - rather then get rid of the gate guns use your influence/bribery skills to pay them off! pay off your negative security status. (make it expensive) bribe concord so that you don't show up in local. (used by pirates and anti-pirates)hire npc mercenaries to accompany you.if you were an empire how would you appeal to the populace to move to a lawless area? less taxes and greater benefits! give low sec absolutely no transaction, manufacturing, or research taxes. boost those taxes in high sec to create a discrepancy that actually appeals to people.make npc corporations either all high sec or all low sec. this prevents lp's from being transferred in my next suggestion - make more exotic rewards in the stores available only in low sec.faction drops only available in low sec.minerals and such only available in low sec.gambling.pirates vs. concord faction warfare.my last point is that people are hungry for small group and solo pvp. low sec is the last area where you could really make it happen."
11/18/2010,"also to the guy above, add drugg production and trade, maybe have certain highsec system have some crackheads who need there blue pills, drug running should be a profession imo and manufacture should naturally be in lowsec."
11/18/2010,"that proposal is fairly bad, the way the pirate gets punished is there are mechanics there that once he/she kills you, you have killrights then you can kill him anywhere without any problems from npc's.all your idea would do is encourage people to bring larger blobs to kill single ships so when those npc's spawn the fleet kills them. your proposal would discourage small ships and solo pvp.to the op low sec is good as it is, it may need a little tweaking but largely its great and alot of people love not having the politics of 0.0 there."
11/18/2010,hell ya make low sec sov claimable. i would love to take over black rise to make our tech moons easier to defend and to completely cut off access to those mission hubs except to blues. ^^ this is why this is an awful idea
11/18/2010,i would love to see low sec claimable only by corporations not in an alliance. give a chance for corporations to dip fingers into sov holding.just a watered down version of null sec. even allow for ihub upgrades.
11/18/2010,this isn't a bad idea till you take into account that alliances will simply put forth alt corporations and back them with the strength of their entire alliance
11/18/2010,"i like the idea of fixing lowsec, and creating market incentives for it being ""safer"" with player provided security. or concord. either seems a lot better than what there is now.as long as no bubbles or caps it would be interesting smaller fleet warfare, and if profit is much smaller than moons/etc, big alliances should lose their interest in it soon enough leaving it for smaller/newer guys."
11/18/2010,"you can do that already, the only difference is that with the changes there would be an incentive to make the systems both inhabited, and relatively safe. since you wouldn't be able to discriminate with docking rights, bring bubbles, caps, or have jump bridges, if you wanted to hold sov in these places you would actually have to patrol them. and if you are just trying to keep them closed, well, you would have no benefit to holding it beyond what you get now.what the proposal does is that if a group or groups of smaller corps that feel like patrolling the system want to hold it, and make it livable, they can, and they get passive income from it.tldr: you can already camp the systems, the difference is that atm there is no benefit to not camping them. the idea is giving one."
11/18/2010,"terrible idea, not supported.have lived in lowsec for about 2 years, and it's the only place i've found you can get away from the mouth breathers in highsec (and nullsec) there's a neat little idiot filter at the edges.lowsec needs more non-pvp incentives, not some bastard transformation into 0.0."
11/18/2010,this.
11/18/2010,"they have that, they are renter corps and pets... (i'm a in pet corp \o/ money). why in there right minds would they want to live in a dangerous 0.4, if they have the military to patrol and keep it safe.in that case they have leverage to live in 0.0 where all the real money is made and hold sov in systems worth having. not only that but if they rent they can easily make enough money to pay there bosses more then could be taxed in low. all this while helping to secure sov from primary powers.and before you even say it will help secure routes to lo sec. you would be suprised how little 0.0 allainces care. need to get to sov, take a shuttle or a warp core stabed frig 2 jumps then use the jump bridge. by the time your there we will have your pvp and pve ships safe in our pos or outpost via carrier or jump freighter.there is little to no incentive to do this in the least and will bring to much politics into this. it isn't a problem to 0.0 corps but they will exploit the hell out of it and ruin the fun that is lo-sec."
11/18/2010,"i do agree that there are many things in this game that create large isk faucets, but i am going to take the opposing matter (glass half empty) scenario and advise it this way.salvage has decreased in price - therefore, level iv mission runners have been nerfed to acceptable levels. a decrease in payout, means less of an isk faucet.insurance payout has hit pitfalls of annoyance. a decrease in payout (which has already been implemented) means a bigger isk sink for eve. if it wasn't for payouts, then pvping would be a much harder game for many newbs and seasoned veterans alike.when you get pewpew-boomed, you lose most of your modules. isk sink. (which you covered)if pos equipment gets blown up, its gone. isk sink. clones, skillbooks, insurance payments, etc (which you already covered). isk sink. if you want to increase the isk sink, i guess the best way to advise is that is to increase the cost of wardecs, increase taxes (trading), increase the cap for wardecs on corporations, allow for bribing concord officials for information on people in corporations (like who they are at war with, for example), and there are a few others... those suggestions i would support. instead of gimping laid out mechanics already incorporated into eve, why not add new isk sinks instead?"
11/18/2010,ban all exhumers from high sec. helps greatly to stem the isk faucet from macros.
11/18/2010,"no it doesn't, unless u count the bounties from the occasional frig.isk faucets are basically mission+bounty atm.the sinks are taxes, sovernty, and lost modules.since so many people do missions, and get bounties there is a bigger faucet then isk sinkhow to fix this is instead of plex for (insert thing here like remap) make it straight isk.if you paid 400mil for a remap and not a plex then 400mil isk leaves the game spaceif u use a plex then only about 10mil leaves the game space."
11/18/2010,"uhm, people, don't confuse isk sinks and faucets with isk market earning.salvaging, for instance, does not create isk out of thin air - you need to sell the salvage on the market, to other players, if you want to earn anything. (or you could use it for production, and sell it, etc.)isk earned through npc bounties, mission rewards, overseer effects are isk that a conjured out of thin air by npc's.iirc the two last issues of the isk quarterly economic newsletter, the isk faucets had been around 3-5 larger than the isk sinks.that's a noticeable increase in the total amount of isk for eve."
11/18/2010,"put aging into the game. the more often you use a ship, the more you wear it, the older it gets, the more you need to repair it, and you never will repair it 100%, every repair will loose some percentages.so after a while the ships and items go old and need to be replaced.old items and ships wont reprocess for 100% anymore."
11/18/2010,"in this case you need to reduce the production of goods as well or you will face fierce deflation. as long as miners sort of couterweight the amount of new isk with an equal amount of new ore, the prices will stay more or less stable."
11/18/2010,"'cause there aren't also thousands of exhumers macroing it up, even in newb systems right? funny logic there--where do u think the asteroids come from? maybe u're the one confused when they're also ""conjured out of thin air"", just like missions. an isk faucet is an isk faucet--simple as that."
11/18/2010,"ccp doesn't decide how much you can sell minerals or ore for*.ccp decides exactly how much isk you get for killing a rat/doing a mission/etc.(* well, maybe there's some insurance -thing or whatever, but that's besides the point)if 500,000 macro miners suddenly decided to crash the price of tritanium to 0.02 isk, ratters would still earn 400,000-1,2mil isk for a bs rat kill."
11/18/2010,"wrong--ccp doesn't decide exactly how much isk for ratting/missioning is either because not every rat has a bounty and if they do, it still pales in comparison to the loot and salvage gained from them, which can still be ninja salvaged/looted. maybe if mineral prices actually crashed all the way down to .02 isk or mining wasn't so riskless and easily automated, then maybe u'd have a little excuse. but contrary to your hypothetical situation u made up, mineral prices r far from .02 isk so that's not the case."
11/18/2010,"if you mine you need to sell the mins to someone that has to have isk to buy it. you cant sell the the mins to ccp for isk....so the isk that you get from mining is already in game. only way you get more isk in to the game is mission rewards,bounties,sleeper loot and insuranace. module drops are not a way to get isk in to the game as someone has to buy the module or the mins your get from reprocessing. ways to get isk out of game is sov bills,clone upgrades,npc goods and insurance. i might have forgot some ways to get isk in or out of the game. but in short anything you buy/sell to a player isnt geting more isk in or out of the game."
11/18/2010,"reading comprehension 0, maybe?? are you really saying that ccp doesn't set the bountis for rats? who does if not ccp?if, as you seem to be saying, loot/salvage/minerals are isk faucets, tell me where that isk comes from?"
11/18/2010,your an idiot and probably didnt understand a single thing in there.sound may be able to leap across a vacuum separating two objects made of piezoelectric crystals.is eve made out of piezoelectric crystals? no it is not you would not be able to hear anything in eve.
11/18/2010,"as it stands now singularity is great place to screw around, try out ship builds, go places you haven't been before and generally test all manner of things out. why not just give everyone on the test server all skill points trained, hyper speed training or require no skill points for anything. there would be many more adventures to be had if you could go there and fly titans without fear or try out different t2 ships and see if they're what you want to train for before you do a lot of training on tranquility you may regret later. over all though, it would be a great way to draw more people to the test server and make things more interesting there. why not pull the capital ships in high sec nerf as well. who wouldn't want to see how long a titan could hold out against concord. there are just too many things that could be fun about singularity that just aren't atm. it's already like a partial eve simulator, why not take it all the way?my corp is new and nowhere near having the skills for titans and even then, you can't all have them, it isn't feasibly or financially sound. what corp wouldn't want to go and have a full on titan fight? think about it."
11/18/2010,"what part of ""public test server"" led you to believe it should be any more or less fun than tq?"
11/18/2010,thats exactly what happened the last time ccp gave everyone all lvl5 skills. it made testing bugfixes and stuff almost impossible.that said ... not supported
11/18/2010,so what you mean is that people would be too busy screwing around to actually test things out?
11/18/2010,"the issue, as dm alludes to, is that sisi is just not capable of handling as heavy a load as tq. i'm not even sure it's more than one server - the point is, you suddenly get a bunch of people over there for the hell of it to blow a bunch of crap up and introduce a lot of load on the environment and it'll crash, which could interrupt testing other people are trying to do."
11/18/2010,"you should get 2 training cues on sisi, your currently active one on tq and the one that you just added on to sisi."
11/18/2010,"new weapon type - tank breakersok we have all heard the many posts lately about drake gangs and how there more or less unbeatable ( and yes i've seen firewall) well with a little thinking i came up with this idea. a third weapon system that specifically targets either shields or armor doing massive damage , but little else to everything else. anti shield weapons plasma torpedo - a combination of a laser cannon and hybrid system the plasma torpedo fires a ionized ball along a lasers path towards a target ship , upon reaching close proximity the plasma balls field reacts with the target ships causing it to explode with a far greater impact zone than any other current weapon system. due to the sheer size of the impact zone the shields expend a far greater amount of energy blocking the attack causing massive damage to shield hpdust bomb - a small charge that when fired from a hybrid turret explodes mere meters from the shields perimeter showing it with superconductive spikes and dust, the spikes cause the shields reflex action while the dust causes massive shorting out of shield power due to arcing.both the plasma torpedo and the dust bomb do virtually nothing to armor or hullanti armor weaponskk missile - more or less a hollow tube with a dense armor penetrating head and hyper powered engine this missiles sole purpose is to hit a ships armor and do as much damage as possible. armor piercing rounds - a special super dense round that will punch through even the most heavily resistant armor plates like there where butter the shields energy reflex will cause these rounds/missiles to shattering impact, and they pass through the hull like tissue paper causing relatively little damage. these weapon systems could function in one of a few ways1 they could simply hit a ship and treat it as a zero resistance shot.2 they could simply remove x amount of shield/ amour hp per hitthis will also negate ""super ships"" equipped with these weapons as a full bs equipped with say the plasma torpedoes may be able to drop a drakes shields pretty quickly but it still requires buddies to finish the job . this would also lead to a way to tame the ever increasing drake armies without nerfing are beloved bent panel ship."
11/18/2010,"i stop reading right here. you have no clue whatsoever. drake gangs can be killed with many gang types. even when fighting 200-300 of them. firewall is just one of them.1. lr hac, only works reasonable if the lag isnt too bad. but you can stay at 95-105km out side the range of a drake and melt them.2. ahacs. requires good teamwork with tackle (especially webs)3. bs setups that can hit at the same range as drakes, set up with proper buffer. can be firewall, doesnt have to be.before inventing new stuff, maybe start using the options we have already. or at least dont use them as reasoning for your ideas."
11/18/2010,"drakes have numerous counters, even in large numbers. this is an awful idea. if one weapon does as you say a ""massive"" amount of shields or armor damage why use lesser weapons?to the other dude, firewall didn't ""work"" against the drakes. if you watch the video the drakes spent 9/10ths of the fight not even firing at them, anytime they did fire into the blob whatever they shot at died. they ignorantly thought ""lolsb bs"" and almost completely ignored the smartbombing bs fleet. their allies won that fight, it had very little to do the use of smartbombs. you can choose to not believe me but you will see in time that ""firewall"" is just a dumb gimmick that lucked into the right spot and time. what you see in the video is two drake fleets fighting eachother with a ball of sbing bs being orbited around."
11/18/2010,"because if you took the time to read my post you would see the lines that said that none of theses systems where any good at damageing anything they where not designed for. ie the plasma torpedo is great for bashing a draks shields but once there down they dont inflict any damage to the armor or hull, hence you would still need conventional wepons on an ally for finish it off."
11/18/2010,and once your tank buster comes out then people will want a tank buster buster.then youll cry for a tank buster buster buster. seriously its a stupid idea.
11/18/2010,"ccp have already implemented something like this system with racial resists.shields have a very low em resist and armor has a huge dirty explosive hole.both can be mitigated somewhat with specific hardeners but you'll never get a 98% explosive resist phobos, for instance.so what you're really asking for is 100% of a specific damage type weapon, which could easily be accommodated with the current ammo system- in fact, it's what makes caldari boats preferred for mission running."
11/18/2010,bombs???use a bomber blob to kill drake blobs.also for killing armor a missile that accelerates toward the ship and warps through it would be awesome.
11/18/2010,"not sure if this has been talked about before but there i go! i think that having an afk or inactive alt cloaked in hostel space is a bad idea. corps or alliances should be able to install a system-wide anti cloaking device. so such device could give out a warning to all cloaked ships in space every 30 minutes like the down time counter. if there is 0 activity within say. the time it takes to make a cup of tea or take a bio break your ship is de-cloaked.once in place you system-wide anti cloaking device (swack) sends out a pulse every 30 minutes, if you remain inactive for a further 3-5 mins (this is where the count down comes in) you are de-cloaked.<U+27A2> the pulse time can be whatever ccp deems to be inactive.<U+27A2> the swack should be anchored to a pos.<U+27A2> and the swck should not affect friendly ships.<U+27A2> the swack should only affect inactive cloaked ships"
11/18/2010,"you dont read the forums much do you.................. theres a anti cloak thread about every .00045 seconds or so that said it probly means that the majority of the eve player base want some form of cloak catching installed int the game, however beware that every cloak user from thispoint on will attempt to rip your throught out at the very attempt to remove there sheild of invulnerability that is there cloaking device. that said the biggest arguements against anti-cloaking are that they should not be able to completly bloak a ship from escaping a gate camp and they shouldnt render whole systems cloak-none-usable, with the last part being they should require some kind of player interaction.that said i do beleve we need some form of detetion, heck we have destroyers that track down subs here on earth why not flying in space in eve"
11/18/2010,there are some good ideas for making cloak/anticloak dynamics more intersting. this is not one of them.
11/18/2010,maybe we could have a similar device that ejects afk players from their pos shields?or that initiates a forced undock of all afk players in station?or that automatically logs in all afk accounts?or maybe your ideas are bad and you shouldn't post.
11/18/2010,"i thought that you could have a special probe launcher for the covert ops frigates. it would launch a probe that would scan the entire system for its cycle time of 1 hour. you need to remain undocked, uncloaked, and out of a pos shield. if the cloaked ship does not move within the hour you can warp to ""0"" to it. you will come out of warp within 10 km of the cloaked ship so you still need to be able to find the ship. if the ship moves at any time during the 1 hour scan time you will be unable to get a 100% on it.or ccp could make a pos module that only one exists in the entire game and when it gets destroyed a blueprint of itself is transfered to the corp hanger of the person who did the final blow on the module. this would make it really hard to get ships uncloaked, but if you were willing you could."
11/18/2010,"i keep seeing these threads, and i'm not sure what to make of them. i'm primarily on the side of ""no, don't introduce anticloaks"", but i have to admit bias; i like stealth. i've always liked stealth. but i like to think i can still acknowledge if something is overpowered, even if i like it.what it keeps coming down to, at least for me, is that everything a cloaking ship does, it seems like it was meant to do. you can't find it. you can't see it. you don't know what kind of ship it is, or if it's dangerous or not. these are certainly powerful tools, but isn't the entire purpose of the cloaked ship to have these tools?this particular suggestion bugs me because it appears a specialized solution for a problem i'm not even sure exists in the first place.honestly, the little kid in me wants to buff cloaks; i'd like to see cloaking devices activatable while you're gate-cloaked, just so you can seamlessly transition. that initial ""break"" bugs me, even if it's only for a split second. i'd also like to see passive targeting devices work while cloaked, to allow a sort of ""first strike"" bonus. hell, i wouldn't mind seeing regular cloaking devices buffed to allow warping at the cost of a larger ""expose"" radius; but i realize these things would all probably be overpowered.i'll happily support the anti-afk-cloaker agenda if i can just see a clear consensus on not just how, but why they need to be nerfed. and at the risk of sounding like a douchebag, the main reason i keep hearing can be summarized as ""i want to feel safe in nullsec"". i don't think that's a very good reason.in the mean time; sorry, i can't support this."
11/18/2010,^ this. and lol. of course not supported.
11/18/2010,these are pilots who join a corp with one thought in mind...to pod..without warning corpmates. the heart of eve is the corp. at the present time there is very little a ceo of a corp can do to get revenge. there needs to be set in place punishment for these destroyers of corpmates. i appeal to the csm to look into this grave matter and take action. thank you.
11/18/2010,"please state your proposal in the form of not a whine. im sorry but most corps dont have this problem, if you spend enought time looking through a players profile and look at there back grounds and they have been appart of 40+ corperations in the past ten days chances are that there not gona stick around with you very long."
11/18/2010,you need to propose something.what punishment and executed how?
11/18/2010,"bellator, when something happend you have to get revenge for you've done something wrong as a ceo (usually).""in looking for people to hire, you look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence, and energy. if they don't have the first, the other two will kill you.""you have to carefully sreen your wannabe-members. this wont safe you from someone who really wants to kill a particular pilot in your corp but it will surely discourage the ""casual"" approach to it by making it more time consuming.regards, lax"

11/18/2010,"hi,i was just talking to a corp mate about overloading and the range you can get from scramblers, with the correct scrambler you can reach 20km+ when overloading in a disrupter/scram bonus ship.now that we had the discussion going i was thinking what if we are for example camping at a gate with a lot of traffic and we don't have time to stop overloading (remember a scram stops a mwd). wouldn't it be nice if there is a possibilty to help the person that is overloading his mods with cooling them.i mean there are remote stuff for almost everything (shield, energy, armor, sensor boosting). this way there is a possiblity to overload mods much longer without having to warp out -> repair (or repair on the field) -> warp back in.there are couple of options ofcourse (which are maybe food for discussion)1. the module slows down the overheating of mods on the target gang mate (slows the overheating down)2. the module completly stop overheating of mods on the target gang mate, but cost alot of cap, which means you will need a logistic or something to provide you with cap (require more teamwork)3. other possiblities which i can't come up with atm."
11/18/2010,"sorry but overheating is meant as a shield not a sword. you get jumped and need a little extra damage, overheat, you run into a pack of reds and need to get away faster, overheat. its not a i can do this know so i should be able to do this all the time function."
11/18/2010,"with the up and coming release of eve online incursion, we cant help but wonder how long the extended down time will be! it has to be said that this expansion is set to make all our eve lives just that little bit better. if you havent had an opportunity to check out some of the new features i highly recommend you do. given the mass testing on singularity today thursday, november 18, 2010 at 20:00 utc, now has never been a better time to set up the test server.forget for a second the fantastic character creation, or the epic sanshas incursion. the ui has never looked and felt so good. the last patch left some of us wondering if ccp even listen to what the players what, well they have and it is ****ing great!hmm.. back to the point of this thread. will ccp finally you what most it professionals do and under promise and over deliver? when i tell my it director it will take 3 days to implement a new system i know i mean one or two days, in fact he knows i mean one or two days but i dont want to come up sort otherwise hell just ***** at me!now if a dumb grant like me knows that its important to manage customer expectations surely ccp have learnt (over the last 7 odd years) that telling us the extended dt will be like 4 hours is just stupid!do me a favour! please! tell me it will take 24 hours or get more mim slaves (or at least make the ones you got work harder).and whats more the customer relations department or what ever should be working overtime to put something on! i see there is a release of a new chronicle! chronicles are always a good read! why have 5 new chronicles on the day of release (you can redirect users to a temp site). i mean one can only read the patch notes so many times!""a promise made is a debt unpaid."" robert servicethe next expansion is set to be a real humdinger, thanks ccp.mike"
11/18/2010,i support the general idea behind this. keystroke (as the op put it) should also detect mounce movement and give a popup warning before logging a person off.
11/18/2010,"there are cons i understand, and i listed a couple without being facetious (a beensy bit with the effort required to log in every few hours)i guess i meant mouse then . somehow click resides in the same cognitive place ase as a keystroke .i'm not all hot and bothered about the thing personally. it doesn't affect me really. its just that i like rules that don't encourage waste of resources (i'm not an enviramentalist.. its more a matter of thrift as a virtue) or have a competitive dynamic that just doesn't feel exactly right. it feels like a ""two wrongs make a right"" sort of thing which isn't great. but i do understand that not all people feel that.i am always for compromise where a compromise that gives one party something with very little cost to the other. i don't really see how this holds a dertemined person back....having someone take a little effort to achieve a goal feels like the way to plan game dynamics... but, i think people are caught up in what is now, not how you'd plan in if you were starting fresh.if you were designing a game from scratch, would you , as a game owner, like to encourage people to stay logged into your game for hours at a time when they weren't there ?"
11/18/2010,daaaaaarrrrr i can poop!
11/18/2010,"are they paying customers? if yes, then what do i care, i think i'd prefer more than getting a number even lower than ""40 k users logged on"" on the one shard of my game.also, no."
11/18/2010,"lol wow.. you must take real whoppers if they last over an hour !well, i can certainly see why nothing of this order is on the csm list ....... to be honest, it would be inconvenient for me because i do keep a couple clients logged on most of the day when i'm playing just to save the bother of logging on and off to check a trade price or two.... missing the chat log is a pain too... keeps me from logging onto alts on my pvp ""main""'s account to update prices on those traders in the boondocks."
11/18/2010,"not supported. in addition to what other people have said, going afk in a covert ops and flying in certain directions is a great way to make tactical bookmarks.in the end, who cares if someone is afk? if there wasn't a perfect intel tool called local, then you wouldn't even know they were there since they aren't doing anything."
11/18/2010,"no, not supported. stupid idea.i can easily emulate keystrokes or mouse movements within a minute to simulate not beeing afk. its my choice if i want to waste energy on my computer and i love to read the logs of local and chat windows when i come back of being afk for a while.i also love laying on my sofa and listen to my corp mates while they discuss something important and when there is a local spike i like to help defend my system.i love to watch monitors cleaning my room and house, listening to voice and just sit there for another 5 min to micromanage something.i love to be ingame all day, all night without playing activly.this is no solution at all against macro programmers. you have now idea."
11/18/2010,"bumping to the top, i want to hear more."
11/18/2010,"supported.right now wardecs are too cheap and meaningless. they should cause significant financial hardship on the attacker. i also like the bidding idea for wardeck prices.""but this is a peeveepee game, wardex should be free lulz"" oh come on, you don't seriously suggest that wardecking high sec corps that can usually barely fight back is considered pvp do you? and lets not forget that there are vast vast regions of space where you don't need any fees for all the pee vee pee you may want, and where some of the players may actually fight back"
11/18/2010,ok--and i quote: simple as that.
11/18/2010,amen to that. op needs a somewhat better understanding of some basic game mechanics... terrible idea.
11/18/2010,"this idea has been kicked around in my corp some but not for racial resist bonuses. our thoughts were more of increased resistance overall over t2 or increasing racial stats (ie armor, speed and so on). something along the lines of this:1) amarr: dcii resists, +10% armor amount2) gallente: dcii resists, +20% armor rep amount3) minmatar: dcii resists, +20% shield boost amount4) caldari: dcii resists, +10% shield amountin any case, i'd like to see some more fw exclusive items added. the ones we currently have are few and many are worthless as they are inferior to meta 4 or t2 variants.edit: supporting but not your specific idea."
11/18/2010,"yah... didn't think so. poor epistemology. you didn't 'prove' that somehow ""naps"" will enable mass support, but that you in particular (for some reason or another) weren't particularly well supported by the community. then again, perhaps your 'exactly the same proposal' threads are like the 'contradictions that really and honestly do exist'.as nc folks have run and not gotten in. evidently, ""always"" is, shall we say, somewhat inaccurate."
11/18/2010,"finnagain, nothing you say ever has any relevance to the real issues at hand. your like one massive train derailment stuck on repeat.csm should be imo an anonymous vote, that is to say csms put in proposals and what they stand for without being identified by ticker or name.that way people can really vote on what they want as opposed to being coersed or hoodwinked into voting for ""their friends""."
11/18/2010,"turns out i am away this weekend, from tomorrow even going to go spend time with my bffs in rl, got this huge article on monday about how diseases have destroyed so many lives and why there isnt a cure.i will most likely miss the sunday roundtable, i am sure one of my many loyal members will be shadowing the rooms to see who is contradicting themselves and fill me ini like minigins idea on anonymous voting, especially since it is one account per vote and i would hate to have to see another vote for me thread by vuk.i mean if you look at things, based on reports, minutes and actual interaction who out the csm have actually been putting effort into helping ccp, helping themselves (make supercaps jammable lol) and who just wanted a free trip.sadly finn you fail to understand that the nap cancer will die and when it does you will be left with other nap cancers devouring your macro tainted regions, eventually 0.0 will be controlled by one or two powerblocks and when that happens i am sure you will change your tune on how naps / blob warfare works."
11/18/2010,"glass cannon? slow speed? uses a special smartbomb type that doesn't let you warp away for a minute or two after activating it(with it resetting every time is pulses of course), think normal cloak and cov ops cloak, like, this type of smartbomb can only be used on that type of ship?"
11/18/2010,not exclusively and only for a year but yes i do use it.
11/19/2010,i support
11/19/2010,signed
11/19/2010,its sad but i look at my 1 year old toon as a giant mistake. i would like to pvp but as of right now every fc just says go back to pve because im a blaster boat pilot. even then pve sucks. im about ready to give up and trian projectile weapons. its sad to think that almost 1/3 of my sp would be for a weapon system i no longer use.
11/19/2010,"it is almost impossible to do missions with blasters excepting maybe ae, damsel and buzz kill. because of range.if you compare 4 marauders equipped 3 t2 dm + 4 high damage turret/launcher you will see that blasters are not for pve:paladin 797dps at 15+10km (multifrequency l) and 730dps at 45+10km (scorch l)vargur 763dps at 3+36km (emp/fus/pp) and 700dps at 6+54km (barrage l)golem 825dps at 30km (t1 torpedo) and 743dps at 45km (javelin)kronos can do 929dps at 4.5+13km (am l) and 852dps at 11+16 (null l)"
11/19/2010,it really is adding insult to injury when csm decide to give rockets some love. as if caldary is the race with the most pressing problems. at least missiles are nice.
11/19/2010,"going by this thread, with the dramiel."
11/19/2010,"actually, i think the majority of the current combat frigates are balanced and working fine. the majority of the interceptors are balanced (particularly the combat turret based ones) and only caldari is really lacking here with the raptor, crow isn't exactly great either but the rocket buff will likely solve it's problems for the most part. i'd say the pirate frigs are fairly balanced too (except the dramiel), rifter, incursus, merlin, tristan, punisher, kestrel are all solid and perform well."
11/19/2010,bump
11/19/2010,"yes, i would hope that if ccp incorporated this feature, that an option to display basic ship icons instead of the real ship would be up to the user preferences, just like missile effects, etc.if anyone remembers x-wing vs tie fighter, they did something similar showing your current target as they are flying around. this shouldn't be a problem for modern game developers to accomplish.i would also like to get away from the system of icons used for ships, and use the actual ship they have as the image. based on player configurations, ships can look very different from each other, even though they have a basic hull. instead of creating a static jpg, why not just render the ship as it is, with all of its systems, sub-systems, etc?"
11/19/2010,"good idea. it'd be nice if we could also change the size and position of the lock icon like any other ""window""."
11/19/2010,supported! this would look cool as hell.maybe incorporate this into it too somehowdominion trailer targetting
11/19/2010,"i like where this is going. i'm guessing they'll be redesigning the ui for incarna, i hope they take a look at a way to clear up the ui clutter, while at the same time giving us a quick way to view both our ship, and our targets ship at the same time.actually, i have an idea - each targeted ship gets placed in the queue, like it currently is now, but each window has a min/max button in the upper-right corner of the little targeting window. clicking it, maximizes that window showing that ship flying around inside that window. it can also have a character portrait next to it, with the title of the ship, and the name of the character.allowing us to define the edges of the targeting display would help, ie put targets in vertical rows if they are wider than the targeting display area.i'll see if i can design a quick comp this weekend when i get off work."
11/19/2010,"i like this idea. just like you can turn off brackets, i would hope you would also be able to turn off these though."

11/19/2010,this would completely ruin the economy. unsupported.
11/19/2010,"i like this idea. it will hurt everyone but it will do so fairly. one of the most common complaints about eve is it's becoming capitals online. power creep is a universal problem in every persistent game i've seen. the solution is wear and tear though i've never seen it implemented except in some single player games (stalker comes to mind).adding it would force many people who can just barely afford to field capitals to downgrade to bs's, it will force bs's down to bc's and so on. why is this a good thing? well how many t1 cruisers do you see running around in ""proper"" fleets? my guess is not many. i certainly don't see them. t2 yeah, faction yeah, t3 yeah but not plain vanilla cruisers. the same is true for frigates. about half the ships in game are virtually unused because everyone is too rich to be bothered with them. but if a few extra isk sinks like wear and tear and ideally crews as well are added, then suddenly the smaller and weaker ships become more appealing.i think it's good for game play even if everyone's e-peen shrivels up because of it."
11/19/2010,this isnt a good idea imo i like many others out there still do a lot of mining and having to replace expencive ships like mining and industrial ships isnt my idea of fun id end up with a stuck in the mud feeling in the game and would then just lose interest and besides isnt the armour and hulls of ships supposed to have nanites in them wouldnt they keep the ship looking new ?plus on a side note what about those who live inside worm holes ?? having to take down a pos all its equipement and getting it out of a wh so you could repair it would be a major pain something i wouldnt want to do personally :(
11/19/2010,"sounds like a nerf to acive armor tanking, and what prevents you from slapping on a armor/hull repper and repairing to prevent these penalties if you dont. i feel that it is better to say in the future you can get 100% repairs.tldr:not supportedps:ccp make active hull tanking useable but slightly inferior to other types of tanking please. seriously though do it."
11/19/2010,i'm not against this idea if it was handled more delicately. just having random non combat repairs pop up from time to time would be interesting as long as they weren't like every day or ridiculously expensive.
11/19/2010,these are unusual cases.so not enough.
11/19/2010,this sounds worthwhile.
11/19/2010,this would actually make me consider cross training to fly one.
11/19/2010,this would also have the fantastic side effect of stranding the entire capital fleet while new midpoints were set up if you managed to take out the sansha ms with the fleet. giving you more time to obliterate said fleet.
11/19/2010,"this idea is more complicated than ww2 torpedo firing solutions. no way. also, more cap usage on armor tanks is not a good idea. i know caldari use hybrids also, but they're all in drakes and ravens anyway."
11/19/2010,your name is showing.
11/19/2010,"are you serious? how many people know that learning skills exist at all when they start? ccp could make a big blinky pop-up which states ""we will give you 2 mil sp after subscribtion!""marketing isn't that complicated. this proposal was never about new players.it simply tries to give old players max learnings for free + some free skill points. and you can't await to get these juicy gifts."
11/19/2010,"nice troll. some of us actually think the learnings are **** poor design, and quite a barrier of entry to the game, and you can think so even if you put the time into getting them, trust me.**** poor design is **** poor.i think removing is a great idea. free sp on registration, not so much (assumedly for every character on an account, else useless). suddenly every plex turns into an insta skilled alt, which i'm not sure most want."
11/19/2010,"free sp on registration is a not a good idea because old players won't get any free sp. people who really consider learnings being useless, poor design and a barrier, don't ask ccp to given them these very same skills for free. how is it about attribute imps? they force new players to grind isk for hours in order to buy them asap, since it is impossible to play eve without max skill speed. how is it then about removing them as well and to increase all attributes by 5 in order to lower the barrier? btw: i think ccp should just leave the learning skills the way they are."
11/19/2010,"i think your reading comprehension is off, old players, who have plex, can get a lot more off instantly skilled alts for the low low cost of 300 million. an insta skilled suic ganker for a plex? sign me up.who would ever abuse such a thing?!no, the poor design is the incredibly slow speed at which everything trains without them, which makes the skills a necessity in order to ever train anything at near reasonable speeds. that ""reasonable"" doesn't apply to high multiplier skills because they still take ******edly long, but the effect of not having the learnings is compounded.since unless you are a single purpose alt that is not going to train anything, you are virtually required to have them, they impose an onerous requirement of an insane amount of time, while not giving any tangible in game bonuses other than slightly less ******ed training time.implants are different in that they have all types of tangible effects and getting isk is much faster than getting sp. i personally think attribute implants are fine. not having 5/4 if a serious main character? certainly not.ccp themselves agree that they are a terrible design mistake that they wish to fix, and of the proposals i have seen to do that, this is one of the best ones.personally i think training times across the board should be reduced for everyone, but more so for new people if ccp ever wants to get anything near reasonable suscriber numbers (which by their marketing and focus on player luring features, it would seem they do.)tldr: learnings should go, your idea is still bad and open to abuse."
11/19/2010,i simply cannot agree enough. the entire learning tree needs to go. and all sp sunk into them by existing characters should be refunded and available to be instantly transferred into other skills. and base training speed should be increased to as if characters already had the entire learning tree 5'ed.
11/19/2010,"no, my reading comprehension is ok. i just don't see the problem. or how does it change the situation compared to now? are there now no suicide gankers? yeh, there will be more suicide ganks! so what? that is what eve is about, dark and harsh place.so on the one hand you say ""which makes the skills a necessity"", and on the other hand you say ""while not giving any tangible in game bonuses other than slightly less ******ed training time""why is a slightly less training time a necessity? i translate:""i am inpacient little kid and i am going to cry if i can't fly titans after 1-2 months playing.""attribute imps have exactly the same tangible effects as the learnings do, just for isk instead of sp. and to earn 10 mil would take a trial account about a week, and he only would get one +3 imp for it."
11/19/2010,"checked on that lately? running the epic arc and the tutorial missions made me about 30 million, and i am sure i did that in much less than a week. more like a couple nights.as a newer player the worst part of this game is waiting for the learnings to level while not gaining any benefits for my ships.very support removing them."
11/19/2010,"don't feed the troll """"i am inpacient little kid and i am going to cry if i can't fly titans after 1-2 months playing."""". i lulz'dhis post is so full of nonsensical garbage its not even funny.tldr: learnings must go, people who can't spell inpatient and have terrible ideas, don't like the idea of more people playing the game and the game being more accessible."

11/19/2010,"lmfao lord elfa. all i thought of when reading your post was runescape. take your two sense back, dont wana flame but what you say is scary.0.0 : strength in numbers, where i live is probably safer than highsec, and anoms are sweeet. keep it.lowsec : pirate hellhole is correct, so it should be made worth while to go there as this is most dangerous (in my opinion)highsec : i wouldnt change it."
11/19/2010,"lowsec actually needs to be made the most profitable area of space. it should produce more isk per hour than nullsec, wh space, and highsec.risk versus reward, as they say."
11/19/2010,"don't be mad portmanteau, i'm not trying to ruin your game. just because i've only played it for 4 months doesn't mean i'm not entitled to my opinion of what i would like to see. if i didn't like the game as it is now i would go elsewhere. i mean its not like ccp is going to read my post and go directly to making eve the way i like it or anything and nor would i want them to.. hell, even i laugh at some of the stuff i post days after i post it and wonder what i was thinking at the time.bottom line is, it was just a post, so don't get your knickers in such a twist over it. also, while i've only been a player for 4 months, it doesn't mean i haven't spent a lot of times digging through the forums and reading up on the history of the game. you know you don't have to play the game for 5 years to understand it. it's a sandbox game where everyone's combined efforts make the game world what it is. i'm also aware that if i and nearly 60% of the posters on these boards got what they think they want implemented in game, the whole thing would collapse into ruin inside of 2 moths or less.it doesn't mean i'm not going to say something ******ed and outlandish for ****s and giggles, that's part of the fun in posting on here, sometimes you say something serious with real feeling and sometimes you talk out your butt for great justice. it's all in good fun as far as i'm concerned.fly safe."
11/19/2010,there isn't one currently. and every other has one. so ecm needs one.thats all i have to say.

11/19/2010,"i'm sure this has been proposed numerous times, just thought i'd bring it up again.currently we undock, align, then warp. in a straight line. through planets, through asteroids, through the station right next to you. i overlook it, but it would be so much cooler to warp around them, and it would also add another layer of strategy to safe bookmarks and where to bubble someone mid-warp.to fix it, eve makes a few simple calculations, for a path that is bezier. instead of aligning directly towards your target, you align based on the path generated. going into warp causes you to swing around a station, around a planet, etc. it would also be an extremely cool effect, watching your fleet weave around planets as they warp to the gate.would this have effects on lag? i don't think so, if the fleet leader's client made the path, then all it would do is sync that path up with the server, and the clients would interpret the flight based on the points and the bezier to smooth out the motion."
11/19/2010,bubbling someone mid-warp...-.-
11/19/2010,"do you really think that ccp knows who the bots are, and is just sitting there with their finger on the ban button waiting for them to sell some isk? what benefit would that be to them? there will eventually be a holy rage ii, after which the bot/macro people will write a program to compensate, and the cycle begins anew. yes bots/macros are frustrating. welcome to mmo's."
11/19/2010,"obviously the botting issue is becoming increasingly worse... again.and, like last time, we the players are seeing little to nothing done about it. the botters (or macro users if you prefer) seem to operate with impunity. we report them day after day, week after week and nothing happens. the same botters are still there and new ones appear every day.maybe ccp is doing something about them. we don't know. all we see is the same bots over and over mining/ratting/hauling/trading and we report them over and over without results.hell, maybe i should start up a few botting accounts for the extra income. the chances of actually getting banned are slim to none."
11/19/2010,"ironically this particularly odd clause makes it ok to macro as long as you do it slower, ergo, macro-ing itself isn't actually against the eula?seems to me like if they'd meant no bots, they'd of put, 'no bots' irrespective of the speed at which they work. this seems specific? anyone clear it up?"

11/19/2010,"with real and honest respect, you guys are all full of it.there is only one game mechanic difference between high sec and low sec, and it's not so dramatic a difference, concord.you already can do everything in lowsec that you can do in high sec, and you can do it safely. the only people who get killed in lowsec are:1) unready people2) not paying attention people3) pvpers who all die once in a whilein lowsec, i mine in my hulk, i haul in my orca, i run missions, i rat, i do pi, i trade...i do all the things that most everyone does in highsec. the only difference is how i fit my ships, and i pay more attention to what's going on. in three years i beleive i have lost a total of 4 or 5 ships in lowsec used in an industrial capacity, and every time it was my fault (except one client crash).so this whole thread is a bunch of manure. what low sec needs are simply more incentives for more industrialists to take the time to learn how to reduce the risks. dying in lowsec is strictly caused by pilot error.want to learn how to take advantage if lowsec safely? join my alliance.escocealliance lead, united trade syndicatelow sec industrial alliance"
11/19/2010,"your idea has some merits to it but lo sec should remain as it is the only addition i reckon that lo sec needs is a bounty hunter option where you join a concorde bounty hunters squads, where you get paid for killing those with negative security standings and make it incremental -10 gets say 100,000,000 payout -9.0 gets 90,000,000 payout and so on, this would give players an incentive to go out and fight for lo sec making lo sec safer for neutrals to enter and would also give what i believe the pirates also want more pvp and loot."
11/19/2010,100 mill npc bounties on -10s? lawl.brb making my alt -10.0 so i can farm billions a day.
11/19/2010,"not supported.original poster has obviously never tried to live in low-sec and is clueless as to what to do to fix it aside from the standard ""add concord"". therefore i cannot support this stupid proposal in any way whatsoever."
11/19/2010,"exactly--doesn't matter what form the currency is--currency is currency 'cause it's gonna get spent one way or another.1. u're the one that needs to l2read--i never said they didn't set the bounties, moron. i said that bounties r only a small fraction, compared to loot and salvage. just because a small part of the value is fixed, how would that automatically equal its complete value set in stone? in case u haven't figured it out by now, it doesn't. and fyi, blaming someone else for your own illiteracy and stupidity won't help it at all.2. from rats. just like ore comes from asteroids. way to miss the point and the rest of my post."
11/19/2010,"1. salvage price decrease does not an isk sink make. i don't think you fully grasp the way it works. selling salvage at a higher price and getting more isk from players who buy it is not a faucet. it changes the amount moved around, not the amount paid out from the system. if npc's bought salvage, then it would be an isk faucet (sort of).2. you also pay less for insurance now.3. 99% or something like that of modules are created by players or looted from missions. refer to #1. buying modules from other people is not an isk sink.4 and 5 are good points, #2 was acceptable.an isk sink is only an isk sink if the isk is paid out to the system, not players, and is actually gone for good once it is paid. paying isk to the system (npc's, meaning skillbooks, clones, insurance, automatically generated modules for sale on the market by npc's, etc.) is an isk sink.an isk faucet is only isk paid out by the system, such as mission rewards, bounties (on npc's, not players, as those are paid by other players), insurance payouts, etc. as with point #1, selling anything to other players will never be an isk faucet. isk is moved around, shifted from one person to another, not absorbed into the eve system (effectively meaning deleted from existence)."
11/19/2010,this post is correct.
11/19/2010,hey! you did say they didn't set the bounties. i'm must be a real moron to say you did say that did.you still have no reading comprehension (or spelling/grammar conprehension). i bet you don't have the bain cells to truely understand what a real isk faucet or isk sink are.allow me to explain. an isk faucet adds isk to the game from out of nowhere. these come from non-player sources (always). an isk sink takes isk out of the game (permenently via non-player sources).selling loot only transfers isk from one player to another. did i raise you iq any?
11/19/2010,"real simple. any transaction of goods/isk that involves 2 human players is not an isk faucet, nor is it an isk sink. it is just a swapping of ownership."
11/19/2010,"yes, u r a moron. once again, i said they don't set the total value of the rats worth because (try and keep up) bounties r only a small fraction of it. 1. i think u meant ""brain"", not ""bain"", especially since u wanna be such a spelling/grammar freak 'cause u really got nothing to back u up.2. and in your stupid ranting, u completely miss another point yet again--the value of isk is fine. why? 'cause ppl still complain about grinding it, crying about taking risk out of their losses by buffing isk faucets and nerfing isk sinks (boosted t2 insurance, proposals to lessen clone costs, etc.). therefore, the current isk sinks work as intended.3. in case u haven't gotten it by now, the value of isk is fine--u're just making up a problem that doesn't even exist, except in your own little head. u've offered absolutely no proof to prove why it's actually a real problem, just a hypothetical situation that doesn't even exist. so really, all u're doing is crying about nothing. i know it's hard for u but try to actually comprehend all of this...if u even can."
11/19/2010,"there is nothing funny about his logic. asteroids != iskasteroids don't create isk. you can sell them for isk that was created from bounties and so on. this is also the reason why there is no hyperinflation.there is not only isk created out of thin air, but also goods (asteroids, salvage). as long as the amount of isk doesn't grow much faster than the amount of goods, the inflation will stay low."
11/19/2010,"it mostly partially is, due to taxes."
11/19/2010,"the fact remains--even buyers have to have isk in the first place to buy the ores. somewhere along the line, someone has to have actual isk to buy, not goods, but isk, and no one's gonna like spending hours trading, contracting, and sifting through all the scams to get all the exact items they need."
11/19/2010,"i don't get your point and still can't see the problem here. there is no problem with isk sinks and faucets. the inflation is like 10% p.a.? this would be a lot in the rl but in a game where you don't have to save for retirement and so on, it's just fine. if ccp thinks that the inflation is becoming too high, they will simply increase the sales tax, which is probably one of the biggest isk sinks."
11/19/2010,"that's exactly my point--with their definition of ""isk faucet"", ""there is no problem with isk sinks and faucets."" despite some morons that think otherwise..."
11/19/2010,"players do not collect taxes or broker fees, that transaction is between a player and npc's, not two human players. any item sold from one player to another, regardless of its source, is not an isk faucet, as it does not introduce new isk into the system. when a player buys an item from another player for isk, the amount of isk in the whole system does not change. it has only changed ownership. it doesn't matter where items and goods come from. if there were no asteroids, salvage, loot, moon goo, planetary products, npc sold goods, etc., there would be no products or goods on the market. everybody would be flying pods, and trading isk for isk. if there is no isk involved in the immediate event(items being destroyed), activity(mining, etc), or transaction(excepting player to player sales), it is neither a sink or a faucet. check out thisand this"
11/19/2010,"hey dip****, how about you attempt to spell out a simple three letter word before trying to attack me for a typo?where the hell did i ever state there was a problem? i only suggested that if ccp was going to introduce more isk sinks, that the way to do that was with microtransactions (leave the plex alone).i still see no evidence you have the iq to understand the topic that the op introduced. why don't you just go back to wow."
11/19/2010,"moron,lets do some economicsi mine 100000 veld.out of this i got no isk.i sell too youi take your isk. you get veld.in no way did i magically forge isk therefore its not a faucet.the only way isk is a faucet is if it gets created out of thin air, such as bounties, mission reward and insurance payouts."
11/19/2010,"1. because u're the one crying about my grammar and spelling when u can't even spell yourself. or r u just incapable of understanding what ""u"" and ""r"" means?2. and u were only greatly whining over semantics. but i do agree that it doesn't even matter, especially since u neglected to mention that now huh?3. i already stated it's not a problem and u just agreed--do u have the iq to comprehend that? didn't think so. but plz continue.and i quote: let us know when u're done whining over semantics because u have nothing. otherwise, continue whining."
11/19/2010,"in a game with as much complexity and dpeth as eve, semantic are everthing, not to mention proper communications techniques.we still continually have one dip**** calling player to player transactions isk sinks and the same dip**** continually states that bounties from rats are not controled by ccp and are not an isk faucet. it is obvious that this particular dip**** has absolutely no clue to what is going on in this thread.to the op: would you please show any evidence you may have that there is too much isk in the economy?the suggestion i made earlier, imo, should be implemented if ccp wants to do microtransactions (whether or not there is too much isk in the economy). i would always prefer there be too little isk in the economy than too much, as it is always easier to add in more in little bits than it is to ""nerf"" it."
11/19/2010,"1. oh that's right 'cause then idiots like u can label anything that doesn't coincide with their style of play or their likes as ""bad"".2. and i quote again: and what have u done? oh that's right. cry about semantics for reason #1.3. so in other words, u have no other reason to take away isk from everyone, besides u ""preferring"" it? yeah, sure...the only thing that's obvious here is that u're the ""dip****""."
11/19/2010,"wow, now i totally understand where all your emo-rage is coming from. you (not u) see the words ""isk sink"" and think that this is an attempt to take away your ginormagantuan pile of electronic monopoly money.allow me to reassure you, you can keep your play money, i don't want ccp to confiscate it."
11/19/2010,"pretty simple idea add the following line of text to all salvager modules and the skill books to use them ""salvage is only yours once its in your cargo hold, it is not loot so its first come first serve"""

11/19/2010,"ideally it would be a fuller explanation than the one mchief117 gave, but i completely support the idea."
11/19/2010,"right, so where are the piezoelectric crystals in eve?"
11/19/2010,this is a subsystem underwater simulator with friction while you are flying in space. there is no friction in space. fix that first.
11/19/2010,"i find it somehow funny that none of you noticed that an effect like this already exists in the game.just look at the ""ends"" of the ""warp tunnel"": the side you're warping to turns blueish, while the other side turns reddish.it's even influenced by warp speed: it's best visible while at max warp speed (warping just 1au away will not get you enough speed to see it nicely)best way to see it is having a dark/black background at the ""ends"" of the ""warp tunnel"".proof"
11/19/2010,derp
11/19/2010,"i say we stop all this red/blue bickering, and just compromise by making warp purple. and space unicorns."
11/19/2010,"while i'm sure this has been suggested before, i couldn't find an exact thread about it so i wanted to bring it up and bounce it off the player base to see what the pro's and cons were.the idea is independent module targeting. basically, in any space show i've seen, the captain never just orders his officers to ""fire on that ship until it blows up"", he orders specific systems to be targeted. in eve you could have a system that would allow you, if you had a a target scanning module equipped, to target specific modules on your enemies ships.an example of usefulness would be if you were being warp jammed, you could target your attackers warp jammer which would begin doing module damage to the jammer until it was no longer operational, allowing you to escape. the damage done would of course be offset percentage wise by your damage type and your attacker's resists. disabling certain weapons systems, repair modules or afterburner/mw modules would be some of the other tactical benefits.rather than make this a suggestion, i would prefer to here views on this from those with combat experience who could point out the pros and cons of such a system in order to more fully flesh out the idea and solve inherent problems before making an actual proposal."
11/19/2010,"this has been brought up, and it wont work.when can you dmg the enemy module?after shield? then armor tanking sucksafter armor? hull tanking works too.soon as you start?step 1 kill jammerstep 2 warp away... this will be non consensual pvp from now on.but wait,this could work if you can only dmg capital modules.death too cap blobs y/n?"
11/19/2010,"this idea has been tossed around for some time. while it is generally well received there are questions about how difficult its implementation would be and what effects it would have on the server load (i.e. how much [more] lag would it cause).also, just fyi... you're a pod pilot... you don't have a command crew (and this isn't a scifi show). you send out orders to the rest of the ship directly and low-level grunts keep things well greased."
11/19/2010,"this is just a thought; what if your entire ship was modular? what if not only could modules be targeted, but you could target your own defensive systems? perhaps you want to put all your armored plates on your weaponry. maybe shields are easy to switch around from place to place but armor is generally more solid? maybe every ship has a weapons array/propulsion system/main chasis or whatnot. maybe one of the key things would involve reacting to what the enemy is attacking? focus your armor repairers on your jamming systems.i think there's really a lot of room for potentially interesting stuff there. it'd require a massive amount of redesign and a dedicated balance team for the first few months, but it'd be an incredibly awesome system once fleshed out."
11/19/2010,"don't see a problem, bring more jammers. posting to confirm this idea and its variations would be awesome, supported.one of the most interesting parts of games like freelancer/etc is that you can disable enemy ships without blowing them up. there is already the potential to disable/destroy modules via leak damage, and heat, opponent being able to target them doesn't seem all that radical and makes sense.it just requires careful balancing, and perhaps less accuracy than hitting the hull of the ship"
11/19/2010,"well, my general idea wasn't that you could just target modules, just that it could be an additional targeting ability. either something trained up or added by addition of another module. you would still of course be able to target the ship as a whole and damaging a module wouldn't be affected by the shields or armor, just resists, as even damaging every module wouldn't destroy the vessel.keep the info coming please."
11/19/2010,ccp could always deactivate the no skill points needed crap when they have serious testing to do.
11/19/2010,"except when it comes to testing having a random guy who's never so much as sat in a capital ship ""test"" it isn't really productive by any standard as he simply doesnt know what the ****. people who own motherships and titans know their individual ships inside and out. that's one of the reasons most the input from armageddon day was simply ignored. it was coming from people who simply dont understand how a supercapital is used outside of sisi or how massive the difference is between the two enviroments battlefields"
11/19/2010,"well, that is an excellent point. it was just an idea, no harm, no foul."
11/19/2010,"i'm sure maybe some of you have thought of this before, and i'm not talking about the rorqual or orca. also, yes i know there's the hulk and a fleet of 10+ hulks can devour belts in less than 3 hours.however, what if there was an actual capital mining ship?i imagine its stats would resemble, at most, a dreadnought class using 3 capital strip miners and a monstrous cargo bay but never going any faster than 50 m/s or less (due to its godly cargo bay, mass and on-board electronics to accommodate the cap strippers). and maybe, just maybe, it could also fit a module similar to dreadnought siege modules, but for mining instead. activated to immobilize itself and all that, it triples the yield on the strippers and/or causes the strip lasers to arc into adjacent asteroids and mine them simultaneously.largely i thought of this as a high-speed solution to nullsec corporations that are unable to get respectable hulk fleets to mine fast enough or if they're in unfriendly territory and hulking the belts attracts enemies (not that this one wouldn't)."
11/19/2010,"no we dont need any ship to mine anything faster. though it seems good on paper you have to remember that these nullsec alliances you want to help would be able to mine more then currently. this means more ships to the point where they are near free. inb4 100mil super caps.if nullsec alliances need to get supplies use a jump freighter, or escort a chain of large normal freighter for some nice logistics."
11/19/2010,"if the supercap actually required attention mining (as in: lolwut no afk mining with 10 chars?!1?!11), it could maybe work.however, it'll be a cold day in hell before ccp *ever* does *anything* to make mining just a slight bit more interesting."
11/19/2010,ccp already stated that no ship in eve would ever outmine a hulk
11/19/2010,qft; further increasing the yield when profits are already low due to supply saturation is not a good idea. cc:ben bernanke
11/19/2010,"mining dreadnought that can drag entire asteroids into its cargo bay using tractor beams, and then strip them internally.make it happen ccp.i mean i'd never use it because mining makes me want to shoot myself, but make it anyway."
11/19/2010,they need to fix the issues involved with mining before they ever introduce new mining vessels. they can start by making mining a more involved experience that requires actual interaction too complex for people to use bots on.
11/19/2010,"supply saturation comes from the fact that it's so easy to mine bots are used for probably 70+% of all the mining done in game.giving them a faster ship would be awful, the whole mining system needs to be redone first (we might see it in 18 years)."
11/19/2010,"new map option. colour lines (or possibly stars, but lines would make security status still observable) based on how many jumps away i am from any particular system. the spidery mess that is our current map is a damned pain in the ass to read, and sometimes i just want to know how far away i am from a system that looks like it's next door but actually isn't because a line i thought lead to a star is actually connected to another star which is in turn five jumps from aeauuugh"

11/19/2010,"supported, but only if it's rendered locally (your client renders corp logo on your ship, as an immersion element, but you can't see logos on other ships to avoid transmission of unnecessary additional information in fleet battles)."
11/19/2010,"i'm very sure the visual aesthetics would be absolutely useless as ""pro"" players always play zoomed out and target purely by overview. who's gonna have time to look at ships up-close like that?but yeah, i dig the idea. an option to paint your corp/alliance logo on your ships. supported."

11/19/2010,"i don't see how it would contribute to lag as that information is already in the packet of data with each ship.if you like this, go and support my idea to show targeted ships up close in a targeting window. as they add rust, damage, and player customizations to each ship, this would really help us connect to our enemies during battles."
11/19/2010,"the point is, if you have a fleet fitted only with these super weapons (sorry, ""tank breakers"") half of them could have a shield breaker, the other half an armor breaker. once shields are down, the armor breakers fire and completely destroy the enemy ships. or a fleet could fit each individual ship with half a rack of shield breakers, and half a rack of armor breakers. it would be way too easy. if these can't damage the hull very much, just bring in a few other ships with normal weapons to kill everything.one melts shields. one melts armor. combine them and have someone else blow through the hull.edit: it seems to me that you're assuming an entire fleet (or even an individual) would only be using one of these weapons."
11/19/2010,"we already have shield and armor breakers.shield breakers used to be called em.armor breakers, explosive."

11/19/2010,"finn has a point. since the ""problem"" has not been defined, a solution can't begin to be proposed.with blobbing, we know it is a problem, but what actually defines blobbing? if we pick an arbitrary definition (say 200 ships per fleet), then would 199 per be any better?thats probably why they haven't done anything about it yet, because any attempt to define a blob is pointless, because blob-1 is not much better.though they could just say a blob is how many ships it takes to crash the server."
11/19/2010,"this is a functional impossibility as not one person has provided one single definition for the ""problem"". to say nothing of the fact that the only suggestions which have been offered, for a ""problem"" which hasn't even been defined, are wholly nonviable. as this thread is based around a snarl word which brings conversation down to the level of stubborn imbecility, it's a veritable index of logical and rhetorical fallacies. for instance, your response to the fact that there has been not one viable definition offered and all the ""solution"" have been nonviable (to ignore the fact that you can't have an actual ""solution"" to a ""problem"" that hasn't even been defined) is to lead off with the begging the question fallacy and then shift to a slew of red herring and/or ad hominem fallacies. that's been tried too, problem is that it doesn't satisfy even basic requirements of an operational definition. for instance, the server can hold one day in one battle with 3000 pilots, and crash another day with 1400 pilots. it can be laggy as hell at noon when the system is littered with wrecks and abandoned drones, but running acceptably at eight when it's fresh. it also offers no viable metric for telling who is and is not blobbing. let's say that two sides bring 1000 pilots to a fight and the server dies, is one blobbing, both, neither? if we're at the point where we're saying that two evenly matched forces are ""blobs"", then we've accepted that a ""blob"" can be a 100% equal and fair distribution of forces. that also brings us to other problems. what if a node can hold 2000 pilots but 2001 will crash it. if the defender brings 2000 and the attacker brings 5, then the attacker is the one crashing the node and not the defender. that means that 2000 is a non-blob and 5 is a blob.which also gets to another problem as well, which is the basic nature of game mechanics. single player games are fair. mmo games like wow can have scrupulously enforced caps to keep fights 'even' and 'fair'. eve is not, never was, never will be. and it's not by design. combatants are allowed to bring as many people as they can, in whatever ships they can. and there is absolutely no viable way to cancel this dynamic in a target system without hard/soft caps, neither of which are at all viable either. if you have an objective, you will try to defend it with as many people/as much force/as much firepower as you can, because eve is deliberately set up so that there is a viable economy and things have value. if i want to destroy your assets i'll do the same thing, for the same reasons. people can either accept that and try to adapt, accept their limitations or vacate a niche once they're no longer able to compete. the forth choice is not (or should not be, i should say) ""complain on the forums"". as pointed out, this sort of behavior is expected in virtually everything that has to do with gaming. 1 v 12 in team fortress isn't fair, and we'd laugh at someone who demanded it should be. 2 vs 10 isn't fair in modern warfare ii and we'd laugh at someone who said it should be. even in eve one lone industrialist trying to compete with a 100 man industrialist corp with 50 members who started in 2003 would be laughed off the forums if he was complaining that he was being 'blobbed' and ccp needed to alter game mechanics rather than him adapting, accepting his situation, or finding a new one. and yet when it's not an industrialist, but a pvper, all of a sudden there is a problem. although we still can't define exactly what that problem is and the discussion is still stuck at a snarl word.we should be very, very careful about things which ""we know [are] a problem"" or which are ""obviously"" a problem if we can't even define what the problem is."
11/19/2010,"i was kinda joking, but i get your point.defining ""blob"" concretely is near impossible atm, and would need to be done before we can reasonably come up with a solution."
11/19/2010,"ah, fair play. i had a discussion with another guy at the beginning of the thread about that, and didn't want to go round the mulberry bush again. and after it could be defined, folks would also have to provide a logical reason why it was a problem. we know, for a fact, that quite a few people don't like being outnumbered or outgunned, or competing against groups that can outnumber or outgun those who they cooperate with. numbered, tagged, and entered into evidence. seylah. but it's a long way from that to an objective definition and a cogent analysis of why it's a problem."
11/19/2010,"i still stick to my definition of blobbing as a tactical maneuver of simple mass movement with little consideration to position beyond ""am i in range?"" except for the brave tacklers. the numbers values that people begin to perceive it at change, but it's a viable enough 'tactic' in the current game state to compete well at 1:1 and dominates above it."
11/19/2010,"ah, you are absolutely correct, i'd forgotten. you have provided the only operational definition of blobbing, but it's also quite different than what pretty much everybody else is complaining about. and, i think, there aren't really many ways to institute los and projectiles continuing on with inertia (and such) other than by crushing the living hell out of the server in ways that even the largest battles haven't managed to do. kudos to you, though, for defining what you see as a problem and suggesting concrete solutions even if they might not be viable."
11/19/2010,"the only way to do the los and ff is a check from attacker to target at an interval of the smallest signature of the smallest object in the game. i'm not familiar with the code that could be applied to such a check, but it would at best take more resources (which inevitably is going to be noticed) and at worse make eve cry and /ragequit.that's why typically it's handled with a game mechanic as opposed to game physics, as one or two more checks isn't a very significant load increase. i'm not sure if i mentioned it, but in a mud i did a small bit of coding for they had diminishing returns as more attackers hit the same target. the end result was that numbers did bring an advantage but it was mitigated to an acceptable level.i don't have a proposed solution that could work for eve, though. diminishing returns doesn't make sense with guns or missiles. beyond that, it doesn't address the server load issue the number of ships represents, since even with the tactics adjusted you end up with the same number of ships in a fleet. they either perform worse, or have to try harder. that's why i said it has to be both a tactical and strategical mechanic change, or the common definition for blobbing - the committal of all your forces to one locale - is going to continue."
11/19/2010,"i'd be interested to know:* how many bugs are reported each month* how long it takes to process the bug reports: what percentage are processed within one day, three days, one week, two weeks, four weeks, two months, three months, four months or longer* what percentage are new bugs, duplicates, need more info, can't reproduce, working as intended, etc."
11/19/2010,"heh.. if you think that is bad, there is a cosmos mission for a rather pricey implant which requires an npc head. this particular npc is at an open site that anybody can warp to. and he does not respawn. it's first come, first serve. so if you live in timezones that do not easily coincide with dt, you will never be able to kill the npc, and instead must buy the item off of contracts for grossly inflated prices. that is what you call fair and far-thinking game balance.at least ded gatekeepers respawn, albiet somewhat slowly. but i agree, it is a problem."
11/19/2010,"for those of you wondering, monkeysphere did figure out a way to slow packets to the server resulting in his name not appearing in local, this resulted in a rather lengthy thread somewhere on these forums which pl tried to spam out with alts and the like.no one knows for sure if people other than monkeysphere have used this to their advantage but i suspect that a few temp bans and the like had something to do with accusations of such nature. pl now has a bit of a troll going either to try to further aggravate people or to smokescreen this issue on their website.the original exploit no longer works, i am not sure if people have figured a way around ccps countermeasures yet or if such a thing will be possible (as i dont know what ccp has done to fix the original issue).none the less, this was real and if the servers are still vulnerable to such style of play, it is certainly in ccps best interests to look into this, especially so long as pl or other entities are still able to agro things inside pos shields with ecm bursts.ps, someone ask grath if hes upgraded from t1 sentrys yet. =p"
11/19/2010,"i suppose there are many problems with it but here is the main one.the suggestion are are so vague that you cant tell if youre voting for something you would like or something you would hate.plus there is no way to actively vote against something as opposed to just seeing it as a low priority.for instance ""pos games.""im all for making it harder to redock after you go out and shoot at people. it has never caused me a problem but i completely understand why people are unhappy when a super tank comes out shoots at people and then redocks before its endangered.on the other i and most people like being able to peak outside the station then duck back in if its camped. its not cause i want to play games - its because the station has 100s of windows but oddly i cant look out them."
11/19/2010,moved from general discussion
11/19/2010,why is this not in in general discussion?are you hiding it because it shows the obvious uselessness of the who voting thing?im not talking about game issues here. im talking about how the csm thing makes no sense.
11/19/2010,"whilst i certainly agree 100% with your point about not being able to check who is waiting outside before you undock (which is kinda ridiculous when you think about it), i think with some of the subjects the idea is that they are brought to ccp's attention, rather than making an actual suggestion.at the risk of being flippant, if you want to be more involved in the nitty gritty of changes, run for the csm?edit: for what it's worth, i think the fact that they even have this kind of voting is a good thing - i know the validity and usefulness of the csm varies from player to player, but i don't recall any other game where the devs give a method of feedback like this."
11/19/2010,"you sir, are an idiot.let me explain this to you, you go to the wiki page, and you see the issue. you click the issue and you read on how it is broken down. some issues have more information than others. if you like the issue and want it to be implemented vote for it. if you think there isnt enough information or bad dont vote for it. or you know do something like put in effort into the original thread to try to clarify it."

11/20/2010,"i love this idea, if we show support, it could gather a bit more backing.it's number 82 in this list"
11/20/2010,"almost a year ago i posted here voicing my support for the idea of buffing black ops. one or two suggestions have been adopted since then. that is appeciated. however, the options selected were of the most modest variety and for the most part, fairly ineffective at boosting the desirability of flying blops bs. since i have now less than a week before completing all required training to fly a widow, i am posting again to reinforce my continued support for this class of ship.in general, all blops bs suffer from crappy tank when compared against their t1 variants. either give them t2 resists, increased agility, decreased mass, or decrease signature radius. i think the reduced sigrad is a fine idea firmly in line with the concepts and traditions of covert/black ops. these guys should be hard to catch, but not necessarily hard to kill.first, everyone please recognize that there are 2 bs bonus slots, 2 bo bonus slots, and 2 role bonus slots. let us start with the role bonus slots.the ability to equip a covert cloak would place the vessel more properly into the bo role alongside its counterparts, the force recons, covops frigates, and sb. it would be no more ""op"" than any other cov ops ship. and honestly, i don't see anyone popping a cov cyno with a bo. they cost far too much and are far too valuable as portal generators to perform a task that any other covops can do just as well, without having to sit immobile for 60 seconds in a barn-sized target with crappy ehp.to balance the addition of covert cloak and not make bo into a do-it-all covert vessel remove the ability to light covert cynos.the second role bonus is fitting a covert portal generator. needless to say, that should stay in place.as far as the bs and bo per level bonuses, i feel that they are not in line with the intended role of blops, and need to be completely redone.since i suggested above that we should allow for covert cloaking devices, there is no reason to have a cloaked velocity modifier. let us replace that with the oft and appropriately suggested jump drive range bonus. with a base range of 2ly and the jdc skill multiplier of 25% per level, we have a maximum range of a measly 4.5ly. lets give the blops another 25% per black ops level. currently, there is little incentive (other than the widow's ecm bonus) to continue training blops skill. this would make it more desirable to continue training the skill, as well as be balanced. you want more range? work for it.now we can address the second blops skill bonus. on all ships, this seems to be a utility bonus slot. drop all the current bonuses and replace them with the standard covert ops cpu reduction of 96-100% per level.now, as for the battleship skill bonuses, nobody complains about having extra dps. however, they simply don't fit the role and could be better used in an ewar capacity. let's build on that theme. all bonuses are percent per level of bs skill.widow, +30% ecm strength and +5% rof of launchers. redeemer, +5% laser rof and +20% neut/nos energy transfer amount. sin, +5% large hybrid damage and +20% to remote sensor dampening effectiveness. screw the drones. panther, +5% large projectile damage and +25% target painter effectiveness.if you want logistics capability carry remote rep bots. even the widow can carry 1 set each of 5 medium rep bots 5 small ecm or combat drones. that's a great use for a bo drone bay imo.one other thing i would do is to change the jump portal generation skill to allow for it to reduce the amount of isotopes used by covert jump portals. currently it only reduces stront usage for titan bridges. that would give folks the fuel reduction they want, again balanced by skill train time. (ref.)i hope this post stimulates some positive conversation. i can envision some interesting new fits."
11/20/2010,that's because csm has no power and doesnt do anything. ccp fixes stuff at a rate. csm just shotguns and talks about every issue and when ccp tells us what they are fixing. csm claims success.

11/20/2010,im in the same boat as the previous poster tbh... aging is a part of life. and as someone said... we capsuleers are immortal because we transfer our consciousness to other newer bodies. you've read it in the chronicles and the published novels of eve life.so long as its handled delicately then i would be up for it. the idea that higher tech level equipment/ships etc... age slower is a sound idea with logical thought behind it. im not suggesting t1 ships become gritty and unusable in a matter of months. just stagger certain qualities of the ship against its level of use.heres a lil scenario that can offer some interesting side effects:1)each ships systems run at peak efficiency when bought brand new. 2)10% degradation on systems due to continual use over a period of 12 months for a t1 ship for example.3)use of the ships systems incurs a slight but increasing penalty to that system (fly around a lot = slight loss in max speed)4)high sec systems would have faction run repair facilities in stations continually maintaining your ship.5)quality of the maintanence will depend on your standings. 6)repair facilities in 0.0 will operate in the same manner.7)ships being sold as used will create another layer of trade.8)used ships will allow easier transition of game elements for newer less wealthy players.9)used sales would be done under contracts as faction ships will soon be sold in the market tool. i know a major balance issue will need to be resolved otherwise people will just buy used ships rather than buying new ones. so appearance and quality of maintanence will play a large factor. as well as combat effectivenessas far as i can see there are positives and negatives. but implemented gingerly and adjusted over time it could add something cool to eve without wrecking anything.
11/20/2010,much better than the existing bonus. supported
11/20/2010,a reason to actually use a faction ship is an idea i can support.
11/20/2010,"i do agree that it needs something a bit more impressive, especially with two different races' carrier iii required. i am a bit hesitant to give it a significant jump range bonus, however, as just one could grant 250+ cap ships a greatly increased deployment zone. i'd like to see that play-tested a good bit before it went live. my inclination is that a jump-fuel bonus for a fleet would work better and could ease alliance level logistics significantly, but that's just my gut reaction. still, supported."
11/20/2010,"not supported in all aspects. it is not about the 'i had to do it, so others must do it too' mentality.i simply believe that learning skills are a purely optional part of the game. it would spoil the fun of trully building a character from scratch.it feels as if we'd be going back to square one, when a pilot had to choose a career path and render the alpha clone useless once again, let alone the skillpoint burden.as far as i am concerned, i trained learning skills because i wanted to."
11/20/2010,"i still fail to see where the issue is. really.as far as the ""ccp stated that they'll remove it"" claim goes, it all sums up to ""we've had 3 designers working on it for months and it still didn't go through"". so, to begin with a positive assesment: try as we may, we, as a player base, are not going to come up with anything as elaborate as this 3 people could muster, even if they spent only 2 hours a week for a mere 2 months on that particular topic.another statement which i really can't understand is soundwave's ""when i created my (first two) account(s), i launched the learning skills and played cs for two months"".first, this is a game, the purpose of which is (or should be) to have fun. learning skills are not fun? skip them. ""you need them to be competitive!"" you say? what do you want? to have fun or to be competitive? and what does it even mean, to ""be competitive""?let's do a bit of math, instead, will you?so, i'll focus on the idea that this whole skill category and it's (supposed) necessity is an impediment to rookies discovering the game. a rooky is any pilot below 1.6m sp. your ""rooky bootstrap programme"" could be (lower case for base skill, upper case for advanced skill), first to get cybernetics lvl1 and +1 implants for ipwm and a +2 c, then mil mil mil mil mi mi mi pwc pwc pwc pwc pcw pcw pcw. that would take you 6 days, 6 hours and 14 minutes to reach and earn you 347.025 sp, raising your attributes by some 216%.that means you still have a lot of your 100% speed bonus as a rooky. so much so that you can start from day 0 training concrete stuff, to get a taste of this and that, as the first skills available or required for something else are low rank, low level ones: so quickly trained that you're not penalized to get them before comitting to the learning family.in my opinion, the only real limiting factor is not time ""locally wasted"" on meta-training, but isk, as the cost of proposed programme is above 24m.now your mates are adamant that you should delve further in boosting your attribs? blow them a kneecap or two, then. or at least ask them if they ever heard of some ""break-even point"" stuff. all base learning skills to 5 and advanced to 4 account for some further 1.87m sp, which would claim 5.5x more time than what i proposed earlier, to get you to 248% of your initial attribs --- 115% of what you get with the ""4/3 bootstrap programme"" --- if it didn't rocket past the ""initial 1.6m happy hour"".so, before embarking on such a road, you have to work out how many sp you'll have to train on that attribute in order for the reduction on training them to equal the time spent on the meta-skill. i haven't pushed the reasonning as far as laying the final (in)equation for this, but it appears that a pair of lvl4 advanced can be paid for with a pair of lvl5 low rank (5 or below) ""actual"" skills. i embarked on lvl5 base myself as it shrinks my 115 week long programme to some mere 90, neural remap included.will i still be playing eve by that time? if i am, i'll be happy to have spent time on maxing my attribs. if i'm not, then it won't be an issue anymore ;)the important thing is: i understand what i get from it, and i know what i have to give for it."
11/20/2010,"now, let's take a look at some proposed solutions?first, i wan't to say i'm not criticizing the fact that this issue escalated to a csm proposal, neither do i simply want to burn down the propositions. i'm here to contribute to it: it's ideas i'm wielding, not people i'm fighting. i'm not even trying to fight ideas.1. give away all learning skills at lvl3 to every new character and somehow adjust former onesif absolutely everybody has it, then it's dead and useless. simply remove it altogether.1b. existing characters are given bonus skillpoints equal to the amount needed to train all of the learning skills to the levels now being granted to new players. while this gives existing players who have trained these skills a slight boost, it compensates for the time they spent training those skills that new characters won't have to spend6 rank 1 lvl 3 and 5 rank 3 lvl 3 skills make up for 168k sp. approximately two thirds of a rank 1 lvl 5. you might as well give a ""slight boost"" to your warp speed by flapping your hands inside your pod ;) what is 168k when you're tens of millions sp old already?2. refund all accumulated learning skill skillpoints and skillbook expensesthis one would be tricky. what do you mean by ""accumulated learning skill sp""? just the sp allocated in the category? that wouldn't even begin to be fair.to make me happy (and i'm really serious), you'd also have to take back all the extra sp i earned from having raised my attribs in the first place. for i didn't do it just for the sake of it, but because i could turn some profit from it. so, you wan't to take back what i invested? please take back what i earned from it too!that would of course raise mindboggling(*) issues, as it would be necessary to re-run my whole training queue since i first injected one of those damned meta-skill. and even further: gaining quicker access to more advanced skills gave me quicker access to other profitable things (let's say i became a refining expert much faster than a new character now will, which made more isk than i would have otherwise, etc.)if you don't do that, then even as it may seem to relieve new players of some burden, in some mid-term run it becomes a really huge penalty on them.3. replace learning skills with a boost to attributes, gained from having trained skills relevant of that attribi read that in this thread, and it appealed to me. i like the idea that making something makes you better at doing it the next time around. not in the ""knitting 300 socks will make you better at sewing smokings"" sense, mind you.but then again, in the longer run, it just further digs the gap between vets and noobs, as the former will have gained significant acceleration while the latter will not even have set speed.i believe that there are two points that make the current system work, at least ""not so badly"":a. it's capped, in an absolute fashion ;b. it's choice based: you're free not to train them.there are two other points that already allow new players to compete with older ones :c. the first skills you learn are low rank, low level, so you get really really faster at doing new stuff than a seasoned opponent ;d. team up with other noobs like you, do it cleverly, and you'll rip open any solo vet's pod like a tin can!so i'm back to that: if you do something, then you should know why you do it. the key to succeeding in this game, i believe, is grey matter.(*) by the way, where the hell can i buy a towel in new eden?!"
11/20/2010,my blog post on the subject.
11/20/2010,"finally, let's talk a bit of real-life currency, will you?one thing that really quickly popped up in my head after starting playing eve, is that your monthly subscription not only pays for the mere possibility to play the game, have a few kilobytes in some of tq-node's ram that make pixels dance on your screen, but also pays for raking in those precious skill points: no money, no skill points.so, somewhere, i see the learning skills as some loyalty program: ""if you're willing to pay some playing time for nothing(*), then we'll give you back a slight but permanent cut afterwards"". if you're accounting for your sp not in time but in (terran) money, the effect is the same: it's a matter of investment.also, as i said in my first post here, for me the limiting factor with ""rooky bootstraping"" is isk. if you can gather as much as 24m in your first (say) month in the game, chances are you know other players that are willing to help you. and of course they don't do it absolutely for free. to be specific: as a ceo myself, i'll gladly provide the books, implants and explanations to any oog friend that would join the game, just to have the pleasure to share the gaming experience, for as long as possible.so it somehow gets down to this when i speak of it to them: ""hey dude, there's this mmo i've been playing, if you join, i can make you get more for your money than you would otherwise"".that combined to the buddy program makes up, i think, an effective way for ccp to attract new players while retaining older ones (first you wan't to get your investment back, but then the longer you've been toying with anything, the more you'll want to toy with it again), all at the same time somehow cementing the social aspects of the game.now if you'll excuse me, i should have restarted my extractors long ago ;)(*) in terms of character development, that is"
11/20/2010,"i have all learnings at level 5, which took me 116 days salvaging in a catalyst, begging my corpmate to allow me cleaning his crap after him.that said, still the most adorable solution in my opinion is to:1. remove all learning skills2. give all characters 50 more attributepoints (as the learnings did)3. give all attributes 10% bonus the same way as learning did4. reimburse the skillpoints spent for learningskills (how much ever the player already spent)the above reflects my opinion that there is a good reason to train all learnings to v, that i do not follow the ""i-suffered-so-should-they"" mentaly and ergo think that new players should be having it easier in the beginning.this way:new players can enjoy the game earlier and hopefully stay playing the gameold players who did do the learnings do not have penaltyand most important:old players who did not do the learnings would have been punished having a slower training-time untill then (which they should, as the gamemechanics were there, and if they learned the skills now they equally would never catch up with me)ergo: no reimbursment of training-time on other skills (no no no!)this way we have a balance between ""good for new players"" and ""bad for old players"". i cannot count the new souls that left eve after the trial periode, because everyone was saying ""learn the learnings"" (which you really should right now!)but: one thing is missing here: what about the time i spent my money on the learnings?! 116 days worth of skilling something that is ditched? that's almost as much as 3 plexes (or 45 here in europe)!!so players who understood the gamemechanics and did the learnings, are punished by paying more real money than players who did not?! no way!!5. add the time spent on learnings to the account subsription or give me 3 plexes or reimburse enough skillpoints to cover the 116 days i have paid for nothing in the past (in eve it's skillpints for money, just as my pre-poster said)now i do not believe ccp will have point 5 added to their list (if not, don't screw with learnings), but perhaps they manage to surprise me.edit:i also vote for the removing of attribute enhancers (implants) as i think everything should be equal to everybody! but i do not have an opinion about if these five points each should be replced by a 5 point bonus each or if they just should be left away, without any replacement... but i am curious to learn about your opinions.if my proposal was implemented, should the possible implant stat bonus be replaced or not?"
11/20/2010,supported! also been waiting for this. x3
11/20/2010,"i never thought that ""i don't have a figure but, believe me, it's big!"" was proof of anything ;-potoh, what lead those ""souls"" to leave? your words are ""because everyone was saying [do that]"". so maybe the driving force behind their defection is not so much the actual game mechanics as the kind of social pressure that's been built upon it.when i go to my local sandbox to build a sand-made castle, i don't bow to those who were there before me saying that i can't make it a tetrahedron and that it has to be a square. i don't know if the point i make is more accurate than anything else (i never saw any one leave eve after their trial period... maybe mainly because i've been here only 2 months myself ^^ ). i just bring in another perspective.that's a devilishly good point you make there, but then again it comes with so much fur... ;)you spent 116 days on those skills. it's more like 58, but ok. then what about players who learned part of their learning skills while under rooky-boost vs those who did it all at normal pace? what about those who sped up their meta-learning with implants vs those who had none?by pushing in that direction, you end up removing the whole skill mechanics, don't you think? if you wan't a game where everything is equal to everybody, you can no more play even chess, go, or tic tac toe!and in the contrary, i believe that as long as game mechanics are not too deeply messed up with, they precisely are what insures some kind of fairness --- nobody wants actual full on equality, i hope, do they? ;)i begin to wonder if we're not looking too close up at this case. maybe any endeavour at reforming the meta-skills should be done through a complete overhaul of the training system.however deep you're going to try and apply some leverage though, do keep in mind this famous quote from niccol<U+FFFD> macchiavelli: ""e debbasi considerare come non <U+FFFD> cosa pi<U+FFFD> difficile a trattare, n<U+FFFD> pi<U+FFFD> dubia a riuscire, n<U+FFFD> pi<U+FFFD> pericolosa a maneggiare, che farsi capo ad introdurre nuovi ordini. perch<U+FFFD> lo introduttore ha per nimici tutti quelli che delli ordini vecchi fanno bene, et ha tepidi defensori tutti quelli che delli ordini nuovi farebbono bene.""after a time, you'll overcome the pessimistic look of it ;)"

11/20/2010,an idea for low sec would be to ban the use of cynos and make the area conquerable like in 0.0 this way reduces capital ship usage in lo sec fighting and lets the smaller corps get a chance at claiming sov in lo sec.then maybe the game would create a new area of pvp for the corps too small to get into 0.0 and too big to remain in hi sec a stepping stone if you will to allow gadual movement of new blood so to speak into 0.0.
11/20/2010,"the only problem i see with banning cynos in low sec would be that someone could still build a buttload of dreadnoughts and carriers in a system and essentially take it completely over. with no ability to jump another capital fleet in to engage it, the system could be permanently locked up. am i wrong here or am i missing something?"
11/20/2010,"hmm not 100% sure on that can a cap ship use jump gates anyone ??, also we are forgetting the one thing most cap ships dread the most is stealths coming in blowing crap up and well you get the jist of it even cap ships can be taken down using the right tactics ."
11/20/2010,"excellent point. i don't believe caps can use jump gates at all because of their size, so only ships built in a system with no cynos allowed would be the only caps ever there.my earlier post about removing low sec aside, i can't think of any good ways to lure people to low sec without fundamentally changing how low sec operates which would anger everyone who depends on it the way it is now to operate and make a living. i mean there is already a lot of good things in low sec worth going there for, just not enough to outweigh the risk involve for most. the only way to really create a larger draw is to lower the risks which defeats the whole point of low sec."

11/20/2010,"you can't bubble someone in mid warp.take ""a few simple [additional] calculations"" and multiply it with the number of undocked players (thousands). everything you do in space adds to lag.a simple orbiting causes terrible desync... why on earth would you add more complicated calculations?"
11/20/2010,"i absolutely support this one. this is one of those ""fit and finish"" parts of the game that needs to be taken care off. as it is, it feels and looks like a lazy approach.and calculating a simple warp curve wouldn't add to lag. curves are calculated all the time in this game and people don't warp so often that it would be a burden. it's not like missile curves that are constantly being calculated in combat in rapid succession among tens of thousands of players."
11/20/2010,"yesthis could still be handled as a straight line, for the purposes of bubbling / server load, and calculate a more ""believable"" path client-side."

11/20/2010,"1. concord has no clue if you participated in combat or not. if you rep someone with gcc long after combat has ended you still get gcc yourself. 2. if killmails are that important to you, pack combat drones and assign them to your killmail ***** of choice. 3. no, seriously, if kb stats are that important to you, then act accordingly. there's no reason that a ship that doesn't kill another ship will end up on a mail that shows which ships helped to kill that ship. not supported.

11/20/2010,"oddly enough, watching the new incursion trailer gave me an idea for how to make super capitals balanced while retaining all their glorious firepower.people complain about supers because they're virtually immune to anything and don't suffer from the same commitment that a carrier or dread would face.so lets make them commit-o-phobes.step 1, increase range of titans and sc by 25-50%.step 2, increase graphic size of sc by 100%, increase titan graphic size by 150%then, add a new feature to these ships. the story for it would be that because of their enormous size, these ships have to fine tune jump calibrations in order to move. this is a concord feature to limit ""planetary disruptions"" in all space due to the gravity effects these ships have.what does this mean:super carriers would by default require a calibration time to jump independent of capacitor. i'm personally leaning towards 3 hours between jumps because it makes them commit to fights more. possibly smaller.titans would require a default calibration time of either 12 or 24 hours. they could still bridge normally, but could not move themselves more than once in this time period.also, because of cloakings effects on ship sensors, cloaks must be deactivated for between 2 and 5 minutes before a jump can occur.why does this work? this commits supers to strategies either offensively, or defensively. there is no 15minutes of fame and then pack up and go home. you're actually committing them to an area of space and allowing enemies to respond. obviously, you could log them off for 3 hours, but you still run into the issues of being **** cage bubbled on login. if this is to easily exploitable, then change the default log off timer to 3 minutes for any super w/o agro, thus allowing time to probe them out more easily for traps. possibly also default 50% capacitor for any super on log in. personally i like both these as added features, but am not committed to them for this proposal. basically, if anyone is willing to deploy supers, they become commited to an area for a level of time. this allows the other side to either retaliate, or stear clear of them once they've committed. this should allow dread naughts a bit more comfort to actually be used because there's always that pesky range limitation for any supers.ironically, this makes the sansha super all that more attractive because of it's added range. tldrkeep the firepower, restrict the movement."

11/20/2010,no
11/20/2010,if your gonna give an answer please make it more than one word lazy answers.on a side note the way that scammers could be punished is to be locked out of hi sec for the duration of the contract they setup for scamming.
11/20/2010,"the alternate would be to pay attention when looking at contracts.scamming in eve have been part of the game since forever, and it's not going to change.furthermore, giving scammers a sec status penalty (or some other random ""debuff"" besides bad rep) would probably not affect them, since they're most likely alts camped in a station 23/7 anyways."

11/20/2010,you are the one wrong. isk faucet = something bringing isk (and only isk) into the game universe from outsidematerial faucet = something bringing items (like minerals) in the universe from outsideboth are way to generate wealth for your character but only the former bring new isk into the game universe. not really. check the latest quen for details on some of the isk sinks and faucets. sales taxation is not a big factor.

11/20/2010,"exactly--if it generates wealth, it's a faucet, whether's it's in isk, ore, minerals, etc."
11/20/2010,"i think you're talking past each other, with anna a bit more in err.the net sink/faucet equation is in line. price's are managably stable while stilly having a growin magnitude per player as larger and more expensive equipment becomes the norm. (carriers today are less powerful relative to other players than a battleship was in 2007 when battleships were rare and earning a hundred million isk took forever).what problem the op is after(if it is a problem) is the large agglomerations of isk in certain players control. clearly if many players buyt gtcs and convert them to isk, those players don't need another sink.but, like a few others have mentioned above... selling vanity npc items for isk would take directly from people who had more isk than ways to spend it (my favorite was drones that looked like care-bears for 100 million isk a piece)i think something that seemed like a crowining game achievement for 50 billion isk would be better.allow players to build high sec stations with some controls on who can put things up for sale at them (but with unlimitted docking rights) ... or even without the docking controls.. just to have your name up in other peoples overviews might be a fun way for people to go out ... sinking thier isk rather than being tempted to use it a way that bothers the op (im not sure what that is?)"
11/20/2010,"no, anna, that definition doesn't work . or, if you wanted it to work, we'd need to come up with new words to describe isk flowing into the game and isk flowing out of the game. isk flowing between players or isk flowing to and from a given player is an entierly different concept than the creation of isk into the economy.i'd suggest, if you wanted to discuss colletion of welath by individuals, that you do not use the term ""faucet"" because, that is not the generally accepted technical term within the game development community. (read the economic quarterly blogs and see how the eve economist uses the term)you really can't have a discussion if you're not using the same word meanings."
11/20/2010,do you still honestly think mining is a faucet? are you ******edand lol at grammer***gingthe only significant faucets are bounties and missions there are minor ones like npc buy orders.
11/20/2010,"obviously, this term can be used rather loosely and therefore, some idiots (like running) r just narrowing it to target only rats and missions since that's what most of the whining here is about.1. refer to above.2."
11/20/2010,"you are really not getting it. isk faucet = more isk in the game = inflationary pressurematerial faucet = more material in the game = deflationary pressure the game need a balance between isk faucets and material faucets to avoid hyperinflation or hyper deflation. then it need to have a balance between isk faucets and isk sinks (things that remove isk from the eve universe) and between material faucets and material sinks for the same reasons. but little of the above has something to do with personal wealth of the players. it is possible to be rich in game without bringing any new isk from outside (pure traders, buy low - sell high - make wealth), to be relatively poor while bring lots of isk in game (missions runners and ratters that lose a lot of ships) or while bringing lots of materials in game (mining veldspater in high sec). the op was questioning that there are too much isk entering the game (so the inflationary pressure is too high), reading the last quen he is probably even right. what you are doing is mudding the argument with your confusion between what is a isk faucet and what is a material faucet, thing that have a really different effect and terms that mean something completely different. re-read the comments to your posts and maybe it will become clear, if not search the market discussion section of the forum, you will find that the difference is clearly explained there."

11/20/2010,"wow okay so ill put back my degree in audio engineering then. but anyhow not like im a paid subscriber to new scientist, scientific american and physorg.com so yahh i bow to your doctorate in this field. granted its a theoretical analysis, but it explains that the mere movement of a material has induced a subsequent movement in another material through a vacuum. which means the transferral of energies between each of them without any typical mode of transferral, aka atoms/molecules to transfer the energetic compression and rarefaction of a normal sound wave.theoretical physicists believe it has something to do with quantum tunnelling allowing the transferral of these energies but im sure u knew that anyway, and itd be showing off if i had to explain that.but back the the main point of ur criticism, eve isnt made out of piezoelectric crystal, eve is made out of energy, when u really get down to it. but more practically its just a simulation of a physical universe, a simulation that the developers want to immerse you emotively, and nothing quite triggers involuntary emotional responses than sound.sound is just another way of interpreting energies in the physical world we live in, and if compression energies are jumping through vacuums between objects then, whether or not its made of piezoelectric material, it does have an effect on other objects (very very slight effect i might add, but the reasoning why piezoelectric material had been used, was mainly because of its ability as a natural multi-mode small and extremely sensitive sensor). how you interpret this effect, and transform and amplify it into something you can experience as a human being, rather than study it academically is up to you, but id rather hear and experience sound then watch the sound wave peaks and troughs on a daw."

11/20/2010,"when your in warp your in your own little world. odds are (scientifically) that if you are going faster than the speed of light you won't see colors because the shift of the em spectrum is so great (your going about 2000 times faster than the speed of light). i don't know how to do the math, but i am pretty sure you would be seeing radio waves, if anything.when you are warping away from an object you start out running the waves of light which would mean you would see nothing.to create graphics in warp your ship uses known models of the objects in the solar system and approximates where they are in the system by analyzing the gravitational wells before warp."
11/20/2010,"well, you do realize that it would be entirely different game if you change critical mechanics such is this one. the answer is simple - that's not eve."
11/20/2010,"no offense, but that's not a very logical argument, nor does it help this topic along. eve wasn't eve when it started either. eve is not just sandbox, it's evolution. eve is ever changing to better fit the community and create new depths of realism. to say that a change like this would make eve not eve is naive at best. eve could severely benefit from more in depth warfare and doing so would not make eve a different game, just a deeper game with more strategy options when it came to aiming which ends right now at place a big x and fire."
11/20/2010,resists from what? shields? armor? hull?
11/20/2010,"this could work actually. here's how:you target the ship, then you have to select the specific module and then target that, which takes another bit of time based on your targeting skills. you can still fire on the ship as a whole while you target the module, you just can't fire on the module until it's been targeted. targeting another module will eliminate the previous module target, so the process will need to be repeated if you want to go back and target the original module.then you fire. say it's a missile volley, which normally you'd get 700 damage to the entire ship. most of that would go to the whole ship, as usual. but 0 - 50% would go to that specific module, based on the targeted user's skills. each module would get a 0 - 100% health, and when it's at 0%, the module doesn't work and is broken. it also won't sell and when removed turns into scrap metal.i've been playing alot of fallout: new vegas lately (alot) and the weapon degradation system is actually really good. i hope they introduce module & ship degradation into eve at some point. allowing us to target modules would give haulers and non-combat people a fighting chance to escape, and it would also open the door for module damage, module degradation, and more isk-sinks.also, the ship's haul can be weathered based on the overall damage of each module. i think this is a great idea."

11/20/2010,"disclaimer: i have no real personal fleet experience and i'm talking out of my ass.i think blobs and lag are two very different things that are intertwined more by coincidence than anything else. i'm going to define blobbing here as simply density. not numbers, density.mass combat in eve is not that classy, to be quite honest. the trailers depict epic fleet battles, but that's not really what happens. there's a lot of ships in a very small amount of space all focus firing on one thing at a time. now, that's not to say blobbing is an evil tactic and all who use it should be punished; you can't blame humans for choosing optimum strategies. but what i will suggest is that mass combat it eve is pretty ****ing derpy.i think it's because there are a ton of reasons to huddle into a little ball and almost no reasons to spread out. gates are chokepoints. poses are tiny. there's no concept of line-of-sight, and in a large enough fleet battle you play from the overview, so visual coherence never factors into it. the only aoe weapons are hard to use effectively. in a bizarre case of irony, i believe that spreading out the blobs would create more lag, not less, just because you'd have to implement a ton of new things just to encourage people the spread the **** out.line of sight, splash damage, aoe, travel without funneling, penalties for clustering. that's how you ""beat the blobs"". sadly, it doesn't decrease numbers and it makes lag worse.life's a *****, ain't it?"
11/20/2010,"thanks for at least being honest about the changes you see and such. kind of refreshing in this thread. however, i submit that the degree to which pretty much any change would be gamed by the playerbase would make them minor changes, at best. even if, say, there was an arbitrary mechanic whereby only a few people could target a ship or effectively fire at it, the next logical step after that is to keep fleets the way we have them now for bonuses/coordination, and then simply have individual wing leaders broadcast only to their wings for targeting. or squad commanders. to say nothing of what this would to do targets that really do require a lot of dps on them. a csaa pos with decent guns on it and a few competent gunners can absolutely harvest their attackers if you can't get an entire fleet attacking each gun on the pos (to say nothing of all of them trying to down the tower). i'd also wager that if they were going to institute true los for weapons, then they'd have to make the 'bullets' have a certain speed and behave like missiles in that respect. after all, it doesn't make much sense for a shot to miss its target and (say on a stretched out 1000 km grid), instantly hit someone at the other end of the grid, or what have you. and if projectiles didn't continue on with newtonian motion (as opposed to the blue-navy-in-space) thing that ccp has set up, then one could avoid the perils of ff by simply positioning their fleets correctly and boxing in a bubbled enemy. and, a fleet of ships aligning to the same point have a remarkably clean 'profile' if they align for a short while and i'd wager los would be a lot cleaner than some might think. to say nothing of the fact that depending on how such a system was coded, it would be hugely open to abuse. i do at least appreciate you providing a definition of ""blob"" rather than the 'we're not discussing ""blob"" anything now let's get back to discussing ""blob"" warfare with many false/nonsense claims and some things that haven't been in this thread ever!'... stuff. yes and no. just got down earlier today bashing pos m53-1v (pretty boring, we didn't get a fight out of anybody) for a couple hours, then dropped and got counter-dropped heading back to our staging area (pretty nifty) then managed to fight through and get a few kills before our smallish fleet got cut off by one about 2 or 3 times our size at which point we stood down and reformed to assault r-6kym at which point i participated in three hours of some pretty awesome fun with very little lag... at which point i finally got popped and then got wife aggro, so i signed off.it was a whole hell of a lot of fun today. now, the point all along has been that some folks find certain things enjoyable and like certain play styles, despite the actions of some self-styled authorities on fun who want to tell other people what their emotions really are. when, of course, the point all along is that it's a totally optional style of warfare. if you don't like sov warfare/large fleet combat, nobody is forcing you (plural) to engage in it. take out small roaming gangs and bug out if you encounter superior forces, or whatever. easiest thing in the world. but that's the fundamental issue. unable to adapt, unwilling to accept a less than perfect subjective situation and unwilling to vacate and find a new niche, we get these sorts of threads. over and over and over."
11/20/2010,"i don't know. i get the feeling a lot of people like the idea of large fleet battles, but just hate how they end up playing out.but this is not my area of expertise, so i'll gracefully duck out now."
11/20/2010,"sure, sometimes they are more or less fun depending on a whole host of features and factors. no argument there. and, sure, sometimes a 20 man nanopoc gang can be more fun than a 200 man vs 200 man fleet fight (and sometimes the opposite is true). that's why diversity and choice are so important. if folks want to engage in large-scale battles and try to destroy supercapitals that're in the build phase, more power to 'em. if people want to set up shop building those supers and the associated risks of defending them, more power to 'em. if people want to get really excellent (like burn eden style) at denying opponents free transit and camping gates/stations, more power to 'em. if people want to get really good at leading lightning fast strikes with small gangs, more power to 'em. if people want to live in and fight over wormhole space, more power to 'em. if people only want to log on for capital-on-capital slugfests, more power to 'em. if people want to minn all day, more power to 'em. if people want to run missions all day, more power to 'em. if people want to ninja plexes all day, more power to 'em. if people want to play the market all day, more power to 'em.if people want to build and sell things all day, more power to 'em. if people want to find a new niche and create it for themselves, more power to 'em. and so on, and so on, and so on. if people cannot compete in a niche, can not or will not adapt in a niche, can not or will not accept that if they can not adapt or compete then they will perforce lose, and can not or will not find a different niche to which they are better suited but, instead, believe that ccp changing the game to help them is the answer? then hell no. we wouldn't accept this sort of nonsense from anybody else in eve or out of it, for that matter. (""i played halo all alone against 16 guys and i lost, and they aren't even real friends, just pretty much random strangers who got together to game in a team. bungee, fix blobbing!"") that's why apart from kabaal's definition, which has a whole lot of daylight between it and the vast majority of claims that we've seen, we only have a simple snarl-word about ""blob"" this and blob that. because for many this isn't about game mechanics, or game balance, or any of that. sure, some want to make sure that sov warfare functions properly, or what have you. but many arguments are stuck on the level of ""can't adapt, can't accept that fact, can't move to a new niche, so ccp must act."" for other arguments, it's about finding a way out of game to counter forces that they're not able to counter in-game. and that's simply not eve."
11/20/2010,"i can't be asked to read this entire thread, and frankly i don't even care. however, the only thing that is really holding back the fighting in eve is the simple fact that everything involving sov is wrapped around some stupid space structure. this allows for people to 'batphone' in their power bloc blues, so basically your alliance doesn't actually have to be active or fighting as long as your blues are powerful enough to hold the space for you. enter the 'renters' these typically small alliances will pay their way into 0.0 and be stuck in a quicksand of 'never quite enough'. as they gain players they have to very quickly get into the fighting before the older players get bored, however they have several newer players that aren't ready at all for 0.0. end result the older players leave to join more powerful groups and the renters stay put until they just sputter out.they never get their hands on enough people to beat back the opposing power bloc and never do much more than bankroll their landlords.the problem is that for far too long the focus of ccp and its player base was to get every idiot out to 0.0 regardless of how little time they have played or how much per week they actually play. most casual players have no business out anywhere in 0.0, but because of lack of content in low sec they go from newbie cub out of school directly into someone's carebear corp and have no idea what they are doing. they don't have the interest to pour through endless wiki's and how to guides and so they just end up just ratting until their eye's bleed.fixing it, if you want to.move higher payout anomalies out to low sec, make them very quick to clear out (15-20 mins with 2 battleships). give the anomaly very random drops of moderate rarity. wrap in escalations and triggered scan-ables (basically you finish a anom, and it tells you a mag site opened in the system.create better reporting tools in the fleet to accurately and quickly tag targets for ewar and tackle. basically if i place an ecm and it effectively jams the target, it auto broadcasts and makes a viewable icon on the target. this way we can employ far more ewar and tactics. pull the sov fights away from structures, that has been the biggest hang up for this whole deal. simple system, active pilots in a system score points for you sov claim. if you are undocked in a cruiser you score your alliance 3 points for every 20minutes you stay out there (obviously rules needed for cloaks,pos's) if i come in an blow up your cruiser you alliance loses 30 points and my alliance gains 30 points. the computer changes sov at downtime, based on who was the highest for that day. obviosuly rules for cloaks and hiding in pos's, 'banking' up sov points, blah blah blah. oh and reduce the reinforce timer for a pos to a max of 2 hours."
11/20/2010,"this pretty much is the best description of 0.0for me i left 0.0 because of this, i get more enjoyment out of anything unrelated to 0.0@ finn - i think blob warfare isnt just linked to how many people are brought to a fight, i think it was pretty obvious what peoples issues are.i dislike the nap tactics where most alliances have adopted to have any chance at living, sov warfare is completely broken now worse than it was before and now everyone is blobbing with supercaps.you cant really blame people for quitting the game or 0.0"
11/20/2010,"people have any number of issues. that doesn't show that the game has a problem. nor does it show that there are cogent, coherent complaints being made. all this is especially highlighted by a lack of a definition for the problem itself (outside of kabaal's take on the situation that, to my knowledge, is not echoed by anybody else). lacking a definition of the problem it becomes impossible to come up with solutions, assuming that such measures were even necessary in the first place. game mechanics working 100% as advertised and intended. people can cooperate in any units they like, along any dynamics they like, towards any ends that they like. this is the fundamental problem with the ""blob"" complaints; your argument boils down to a dislike for tactics that other players are free to engage in. an attempt to limit the style and nature of free association in order to boost a personal preference for a playstyle is simply not what eve is about. in a nutshell, this is the whole issue. you dislike ""nap tactics"", so it's clear what your issue is. and fine, you don't particularly have to like them and if you don't like them, don't engage in them. but there's no supportable argument whereby those tactics actually become a problem that ccp must, quixotically and ineffectively, attempt to combat. what, ccp made a game where player-created content and player-driven events fuel the inform the narrative, where people can form empires based on oppression, cooperation and everything in between, where groups can be pirates, empire builders, industrialists, mercenaries, roleplayers and a host of other choices... but if they cooperate in groups bigger than those that you like, there's all of a sudden a real problem rather than your subjective dislike? no. while there are certainly problems with sov warfare, this too will only fix the types of numbers that are required for one very specific combat profile. any asset worth defending, and worth attacking, will always see both sides committing as much force and firepower as they can, if they want to win. again, game mechanics functioning exactly as intended plus the ""blob"" snarl-word used to handwave away fleets that you can't counter. i'm sure to a corp of noobs who can only fly frigates, a battleship fleet is a horrible ""blob"", too. if it wasn't supercaps it'd be caps. it if wasn't caps it would be something else. this is eve. people can and will bring bigger and better ships with cooler and more expensive mods than you can. ccp should no more 'do something' about that than they should stop you from flying a battleship if the noob corp wants to have rifter duels. i've said, what, a half dozen times or more that if someone can't find a place in a niche they should either accept that fact or find a new niche. if someone can't make 0.0 work (and let's not pretend that large-scale conflicts, alliances, etc... are all there is to 0.0) then so be it. i've also said a half dozen times or more that if someone doesn't like eve, there are numerous single player games that they may like and, in specific, there's a very popular mmo with instanced combat where the sides are kept equal and pretty much as fair as possible.if eve isn't the game for someone, such is life. if 0.0 isn't the place someone wants to play in eve, ah well. why either of those would be a bad thing is anybody's guess."
11/20/2010,just make the guy that has the key invulnerable until the rest of the rats have been killed. its not a perfect fix...but it makes them do the entire room first at least.

11/20/2010,"so, looking through the list i've seen many interesting topics that need some attention and some good ideas to improve the gameplay but.. how come gallente are not up for discussion? namely their weapons, railguns specifically. ships like the deimos absolutely pale in comparison to most others as well.i realize the different roles we have in the game and that most ships do have their uses, but i just personally feel like the gallente could use an overall boost (let's ignore caps).any thoughts?"
11/20/2010,"they need to be fixed, but it'd be as hard as hell. slow gallente + slow armour tanks + close range = :( here are some ""solutions"" which won't work:1) more damage!no :( blasters can't even get into range without being kited by much longer ranged lazorz, missilez and autoz.2) more range!then they become autocannons/pulse lasers and aren't short-ranged weapons any more3) make gallente the fastest race!ludicrous! minmatar are the fastest! think of all the rage if gallente became the fastest!4) longer ranged webifiers so gallente can slow down enemies from a longer range!no, because the enemies can slow down gallente :(anyway, we need a solution which works ^.^"
11/20/2010,"certainly the gallente guns could be improved, but they could also put a greater emphasis on drones within the t2/t3 compartments. they would grant greater utility or increased damage, depending on your choice, granting a much higher combat flexibility to the gallente ships."
11/20/2010,"give all galente ships a 20-50% bonus per level to utility drone speed, health and strength. i'm thinking if galente ships have faster web drones for example they can catch people and move into blaster range.this way you focus on galente being drone lovers, and make the web drone actually useful. same could apply to all drones except combat drones. as for rails, just up the tracking a little bit as well as the damage multiplier. fail ships can just get extra drone space, combined with the above galente drone bonus it would open up different interesting strategies."
11/20/2010,"rails + missiles = caldari, blasters + drones = gallente. rails do need fixing though, cap, ammo, horrid fitting requirements, horrendous tracking and the lowest damage of all long range turrets for absolutely no benefits whatsoever. seriously, if they are gonna suck that badly just make all sizes of railgun spec skills rank 1 and have done with it.anyways yeah, the only problem with gallente boats atm is they are too heavy even before you add plates. coupled with being the among the slowest ships in the game and then adding the shortest ranged weapons too....yeah that's reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally gonna work. lower their base mass and raise their agility and that should fix their spacebrick syndrome without affecting blasters when used with range bonused caldari ships, nor impact on minmatar as the kings of speed."
11/20/2010,i don't see why the agility of gallente ships can't be increased and their mass be decreased so their top speed is unaffected but their acceleration is improved.

11/20/2010,"i'm all up for a bit of agility boosting, blasters though really need a tracking boost for the point blank range, and maybe a bit of an optimal increase not much, maybe just 2.5km on large, 1.5km on medium and 1km on small.rails need some love, reduced fitting req would go a long way to helping this though, as would a slight reduction in cap use."
11/20/2010,"the speed nerf, web nerf, hp buff, and trinity's nerf of 'dual bonus modules' which hit rsds especially hard, have all contributed to gallente being the 'special' race of eve. the entire gallente race(ships, bonuses, and ewar) needs a total re-think/rebalance with the other races. it's madness to put the shortest range, highest damage, weapons on the slowest ships, and expect them to be viable in combat."
11/20/2010,"+1seem like pretty simple solutions (well at least progress) to me without introducing a huge problem. just adjust the gages slightly. a lot more tracking on both blasters and on hybrids(blasters could be near 100% hit within 3000k?), and easier fitting ("
11/20/2010,support this idea if you want to see the power of no any time soon....
11/20/2010,"the vote is for priority.these issues that have been raised are all issues which will be presented by the csm. the voting just serves as an attempt to reach a consensus on which issues are the most severe. this is probably why there's no ""downvote""."
11/20/2010,there is nothing about fixing lowsec! what a shambles! design by committee never works! especially when carebears are the committee!
11/20/2010,"the voting is a good thing but csm should always pick out issues that may be less 'populair' and thus never would make a chance in a vote system.some issues may affect just a small group of people, like the font size.""fix the lag"" would be more populair than ""fix my headache because i cant read my eve interface"" (bad eyes or screenresolution is too high, or both)what i'm saying is that with many issues you just can go do something else in game, however a fontsize problem will affect a player in the whole game.and that's a task for csm to see the difference and to priorize such issues."
11/20/2010,"the player prioritization is an input to our decisions, but it is not the only input, and we will not blindly use it to set our priorities for the planning meetings.many other factors come into play, such as feedback we get from ccp about feasibility of particular items, how they might coordinate with things ccp intends to do (or not), and so on."
11/21/2010,"as soon as i found out about the black ops ships, i wanted to fly one. i have put the bulk of my skills into flying a sin. once i wasnt so green anymore, i realized that they needed a little work.please fix this so my skill training doesnt go to waste!"
11/21/2010,fw plexing is still broken. the 4 suggestions in the op would make plexing much better - something to actually be proud of doing. it would also help solo and small gangs find *quality* pvp faster.
11/21/2010,no
11/21/2010,"i'll elaborate. assault ships already have a 4th bonus. it's resists. someone already explained that just a few posts above yours. go check it out.are you implying all t2 ships (except for the af) have five bonuses? well heavens we better change the op title or no one will know what they're talking about. should be ""give af their 5th bonus""lol get a clue noob."
11/21/2010,"af needs more agility and speed, because crusersize aligntime makes them unuseble in 00."
11/21/2010,"as a typical blaster loving, drone-***** gallente, i would have to say yes!"

11/21/2010,"awesome, even ccp supports it :d"
11/21/2010,supported.also:^this
11/21/2010,"supporting, indirectly. ms should be twice carriers, carriers are good, dreads are too big, and battleships are too big. if they all got scaled down, and ms increased a bit, it would all look right."
11/21/2010,moar bigger!
11/21/2010,"i agree, all capitals need to be increased in size, not just super carriers. it is a bit absurd to see a machariel next to a wyvern or hel.... i only just recently saw a wyvern in combat, and was a bit suprised to see my revelation was bigger..... this needs to be changed. no ship that powerfull should be so small...."
11/21/2010,supportdramiel - unbalanced ship in frigsize
11/21/2010,i totally f****** agreed with that there should be one whole expansion for rebalancing every singe thing in eve yep thing not just ships just everything.(oh and so all the employees have something to work on they can redo the ship models =) )as that is probably never gonna happen i support this instead
11/21/2010,"dramiels are overpowered.simply, the more overpowered something is, the more people will fly it than others in its class.thats why you see so many dramiels, machariels, vagabonds, drakes, etc./supported"
11/21/2010,"firstly: why?mining is one of the biggest parts of eve. asteroid belts are in almost every system. the hulk is one of the most popular ships in the game. it's the second most practiced activity in the game, just below shooting things. it's the backbone of the eve economy. it's also mind-numbingly boring, and it hasn't seen any real attention since.. well, honestly, i couldn't tell you. i've been playing eve on and off for about six years, and the mining i do in my hulk is the same kind of mining i did all those years ago in my bantam in todaki. just with a much bigger cargohold and ore yield.let's establish what this proposal is not about. firstly...this is not about macro miners. macro miners will appear everywhere. short of adding captchas to every station's docking bay doors, there isn't a whole lot we can do about it. secondly...this is not about profitability. i'm not going to argue about if i think mining needs to be a bigger moneymaker. mining touches on every part of the eve economy, and i'm not about to go poking that hornets nest with a sharp stick. finally...this is not about pirates vs carebears. this isn't about gameplay styles. it's about a prominent feature being boring to the extent that it's actively damaging to the game's reputation.no, this is about gameplay.we can talk about hybrids or assault frigates or rockets or bits and pieces of the ui until we're all blue in the face, but truly, no feature is both so widespread and yet so actively neglected as mining is. so i'd like to propose that it needs a major overhaul to make it a more interesting gameplay experience. the trick then, is to do it in a way which satisfies the folling conditions:a) it shouldn't require a massive investment of developer resourcesb) it shouldn't make mining needlessly complexc) it shouldn't completely undermine the existing structureso now that i've covered the why, let's move onto the how. i am going to throw some ideas out there. please note: these ideas are just my personal thoughts and sugestions. even if you disagree with my particular sugestions, please support the thread. this is not about my own ideas so much as the general notion that mining needs an overhaul. also, i strongly encourage adding more ideas to the mix.so, without further ado, some of my own ideas.spreading out the beltsa current feature is that if you activate the scanner (not the directional one, the probing one) when you don't have any probes out, it takes 30 seconds to scan and gives you a list of the big obvious sites in the system; these are the ones that show up with 100% clarity even when you only have one probe on them. probers will know what i mean by this.using this system, perhaps instead of there being a fixed number of belts in a system, there could be smaller but more numerous asteroid clusters with varying ore types; say, a dozen rocks per cluster. you could then look into scaling the ores more smoothly across the different security statuses. perhaps you scan in a system and find 20-odd clusters. perhaps some of those clusters have the occasional mercoxit rock in them. maybe some have more than others. maybe some rock clusters have more dense asteroids but smaller ones. maybe you have the choice of either going for the first asteroid cluster you pick up on scanners, or you shop around to see if you can't find something more profitable. these little rock clusters could show up randomly across systems, rather than being densely packed. perhaps some systems just tend to have more asteroid clusters than others. there's a lot that could be done with this.this is getting a bit full, so continued on my next post."
11/21/2010,"shrinking and scattering the asteroidsone thought i often have is breaking things up more; basically, meaning there would be more asteroids of smaller size, and cycle times for mining lasers would be lower. in this, your concerns should be more about constantly picking and choosing your asteroids, with asteroids constantly depleting and the need to pick new targets, as well as keep an eye on your survey scanner to really maximize your output. you could still have the bigger plainer rocks, but it might make things more interesting all the same.varying densitywhat if, rather than the simple case of three different density measures, you had only the base ore type, but you had denser asteroids give you more ore? in this way, you could give each asteroid not only a size, but a density; do you go for the bigger rocks that are more sparsely packed, or the really small dense ones, even though it means paying more attention? pack that survey scanner!mining laser falloffget up close, mine more ore faster. doesn't have to be an enormous difference, but those bigger mining barges aren't exactly fast; if you want to get in close to every little rock before mining it, things might get slow. also makes things more interesting for the rookie in the bantam who can really move about the belt.expanding on deep core miningthis is barely a suggestion really, but it's a notable place where you could expand more. just some ideas off the top of my head: denser ore, but slower mining. mine minerals straight from the rock so you don't have to go through the refining process, but again at the cost of slower mining. maybe make it a gambling, where either you get a big burst of good ore, or the rock explodes into a gas cloud or such. speaking of which..gas cloudswhy should ore miners have all the fun? maybe some of those asteroid clusters have more gas than rocks. heaven knows it'd be more interesting that the occasional ladar site.randomizationsystems are cheaper than content. rather than just going and designing 50 different rock clusters and spreading them across however many thousand systems exist in eve, get creative with fractals and random number generators; you go flying towards a rock belt, who knows what you might find. a super densely packed cluster of tiny rocks? an enormous veldspar boulder spinning through space? maybe you'll find something high in scordite, or pyroxeres asteroids with tiny bisot cores. bias your clusters by the security status of the system and the sector of space they appear in.conclusion and final statementsthe main thing about all the above ideas is that they require little to no actual content to be developed. you've already got the asteroid models and the mining lasers and the minerals and all that; they also don't really upset the core of mining or even the economy in any great manner as long as you're careful about it. mining still does what it used to do; it's just a more involving process without being too obnoxious. if you're one of those miners who tends towards the alt-tab game, feel free to head to the first belt you find and just chip away at the veldspar.mainly though, this is all low hanging fruit. the payoffs would be enormous; it's a core enough feature that you could sell an expansion off of it, it's hardly a feature that everybody loves the current state of, yet it wouldn't require any real additional content development. a bit of programming time, yes, but everything else is already there. it's a very old and well known feature, and you can shout to the world that, in fact, yes, ccp does care about excellence. even in mining.and if you're not a miner?hey, more hulkageddon targets."

11/21/2010,"omen is the reason why i switched to using an arbitrator (omen sucks btw), and now my drones are more of a primary weapon against frigates, secondary against cruisers if my guns can't hit them. and the omen isn't good enough or worth enough to consider rigging normally (rigging it would cost more than the ship, and for that price a drone boat would be more effective)"
11/21/2010,"what it says on the tin. the idea of an ishtar scooting about at 500 m/s (the maximum speed of a tractor beam) with his sentries in tow is just too hilarious to pass up.it would be a bit of a stealth marauder buff, though. letting them use sentries a little more easily and whatnot."
11/21/2010,"i haven't thought about whether it would be good or bad for the game, but the image of a running ishtar with sentries following is hilarious."
11/21/2010,i think that not only destroyer upgrade is needed. but some faction destroyers too. destroyers can be much more then they are now. like medium assault ships. or stealth guard or ambush ships.
11/21/2010,"good post! a little bit ot here, but i think that, at this point, almost everyone wants ccp to fix and finish the product that is live now on tq, instead of wasting resources on another half-content semi-finished expansion.as i stated on the op, this proposal would never be prioritized over issues like lag, game balance, etc...reading your post, makes me think it could be done simultaneous. if the coders will be working on existing content, makes sense that the artists would do the same.all in all, it's just eye candy... but we like it :dps: changing op to ""moa and other goofy ships"" :)ps2: supporting my own idea lol"
11/21/2010,since these aren't coming out for a few months yet we have time to push this change through if we show enough support for it :)
11/21/2010,"the thinking behind this idea is good, but the bonus itself is horrible,does eve-online really need all capital ships to move 30% further per jump? wont the already ridiculous speed with which you can move to opposite ends of the universe just get worse?"
11/21/2010,why is more mobility and thus more in combat and dying a bad thing?
11/21/2010,"because it is just effectively making eve smaller and promoting blobbing even more. it will result in less combat since its main use will only be hotdropping with ridiculous odds, and i wouldnt call a slaughter combat. not to mention it just means people within 3 regions of a super cap blob cannot do anything without being hotdropped. especially since these days supercaps are seriously used to hotdrop interceptors. aditionally it means using game mechanics for intel become even more useless and the only viable method is placing spies in every enemy with a super cap fleet. that it is a viable option, fine. but does it really need to be the only realistic option?"
11/21/2010,oh yeah!
11/21/2010,so you think people will start bringing supercaps they already weren't simply because of this range bonus? i really doubt they aren't bringing everything and the kitchen sink already. combined with the fighter bomber nerf already on sisi supercaps wouldnt be able to act alone nearly as effectively as they can today
11/21/2010,"giving the revenant this bonus will simply make it sit in staging systems and/or combat systems cloaked to give the bonuses, due to its lackluster combat stats. if you really want it to work, make it create a ""wormhole"" (connection to sansha tech...eh?) to whatever cyno beacon it is jumping to which capitals (only) can jump through. once it shuts off the wh (after a max timer like 5 minutes, or as early as the pilot wants) the wh closes and the ship is forced to go through the wh."
11/21/2010,"one idea that's been proposed in the thread over in test server feedback is to give it +1 fighter per level instead of +3 but with a 100% role bonus to fighter hp and damage (or maybe 125%). this ties in with other sansha bonuses and would make dcus much more valuable on a revenant than on any other ship, perhaps to the point where they might be worth fitting."
11/21/2010,not sure why you think that. it has the ehp of a hel and people don't just sit cloaked in hel's. it may have less ehp than most other supercaps but its still got tens of millions of hp
11/21/2010,"way to ignore all other points, but yeah i think that. now it is too much effort to hotdrop a bs if it requires midpoint cynos, with a revenant in gang you can reach far more systems. same for hotdropping a few dreads, you dont want more than 1 or 2 midpoints before it takes too much effort, with revenant you have then way larger area where you can hotdrop supercaps in some random small alliance."
11/21/2010,if you think people are sitting around waiting to drop a pile of supercaps on lone bs all the time you may not actually live in 0.0 or have ever been in a supercap. :(
11/21/2010,"no need to go to 0.0, happens regulary in low sec. obviously they need to be a bit careful, but if you are the dominant supercap holders in the area not much can happen if you got a few more ready, since realisticly you will need arround 20 non-supers per hostile super. anyway this isnt relevant, point stays that with more jump range you just encourage blobbing even more."
11/21/2010,"if someone is tossing supercaps at sub caps routinely without support then they will pay for it eventually. this won't really hinder or amplify that behavior.actually come to think of it this will hinder them because more of lowsec will be within the long arm of 0.0 and thus this sort of thing will become more dangerous for th elone supercap pilot. supercaps aren't balanced towards use in low sec so if that's your primary reason for not wanting it, then it's unfounded"
11/21/2010,"1. it is just stupid to tell new players that they have to max out their learnings asap. i have mine on 5/4 and am totally happy with that, many people have even 4/4 or 4/3 and are happy. especially because you need to play for more than 3 years to make this investment worth it.2. if someone leaves eve because of the learnings, he would probably leave eve anway. eve is not for unpatient people who want instant gratification. eve gratificates you with delay. and this is true not only for learnings but for every skill in eve. the longer you play, the longer it takes you train certain skills (e.g. bs v). even if everybody would get the learnings instantly for free, it would still take people 3 months till they can fly a battleship properly and would be thus able to do the big money. they would still have to spend a month flying small and unspectacular frigates. they would still have to read tons of tutorials and fitting guides. so i still see no point in removing the learnings, besides that some old players would get some juicy skill points for free."
11/21/2010,"aw, we always appreciate your calming commentary, finn... just an update: wrt the current prioritization, one thing i have proposed to the other csms is that we release not only the raw results, but a version where similar proposals are grouped into categories (user interface, aggression issues, war declarations, missions and agents, etc)."
11/21/2010,"wrong!all countries have some form of parlament where issues can be voted against, we are voting on issues and changes to the game here, not candidates, there should be an against vote, but i think not in the prioritization, it should be before that so that issues dont get to the prioritization list"
11/21/2010,"calmness is for cows, opiate binges and cliched zen masters. just sayin'"
11/21/2010,"imo the problems with the current voting thread extend further than the op pointed out. one of a few problems:take a really controversial issue that many people would love and many others would hate. that issue will end up rising to the top of the list even if more players hate the idea! why because the nay votes are silenced in this process.i support this ""discussion"" but not the exact idea. i think the solution can be easier. give people 20 points. they can use their 20 points for or against an issue. i would likely use most of my points against some things that i consider a bad ideas. so you take the difference of the for points or the against points on any issue and you have the views of the players incorporating how much they really are interested in this or that change."
11/21/2010,what kind of moron is going to build a cap ship in a system it can never leave ?
11/21/2010,you don't go to wormholes a lot do you?
11/21/2010,you should probably change the title to something that sounds a little less whiny because i think what's currently suggested in the op would improve eve.
11/21/2010,sorry... what kind of moron is going to build a cap ship in a system (with no worthwhile resources) it can never leave ?
11/21/2010,"you would be surprised how many people would do it if it meant a total lack of any kind of real opposition hell, all you would have to do is build a pos in a system, a fleet of caps and you could control that system for the foreseeable future without the ability to jump in a cap fleet to oppose."
11/21/2010,"i dont think missions need a nerf but they do need changing, like mining they are ******edly easy and boring.lowsec needs a buff without nerfing highsec, people shouldnt be forced into lowsec but lowsec should be rewarding.whatever the buff is it needs to be for lowsec only, otherwise there would be no point in going into lowsec when one can just goto 0.0 and get all the benefits."
11/21/2010,"the current description on the plex clearly states that the item cannot be moved outside of a station, not even by courier contract. i don't know if this's how it originally was, but i propose the description be changed... i know i for one got fooled when i first read about the plex, and it could clear up some confusion for newer players.it's a very minor change and should therefor be very easy to implent.ps: i'm apologize in advance in the case this issue has been brought up before... i'm relatively new.tl;dr: plex description says it cannot be moved out of stations even though it can, fix."
11/21/2010,"if done right it shouldn't add to lag at all, missiles are more costly and move in a bezier path too."
11/21/2010,"well, you can put ~3000 people in a system when they are not fighting. adding more calculations to a warp adds to lag without even starting to fight, especially if you are in a fleet that is hunted down and need to warp to different safe spots all the time to avoid being ganked."
11/21/2010,"even assuming there are no load issues, there are some gameplay issues.1) the curved paths could run you into bubbles that are not directly on the los to your destination, and in the case of bubbles on your start grid, you wouldn't know if you were going to hit them or not -- warping from a station after undock to a point ""behind"" the station would be the most common case.2) if you just use the straight line for bubble calculations, you'll see ships going off on your nice curve, then snapping into the bubble. way to kill the immersion.perhaps a better solution to this issue is to chance the warp effect so that you see a highly distorted version of the universe outside your warp bubble, one that makes it explicitly clear that warp bubbles can tunnel through normal-space matter.whether it is worth the dev time for such a cosmetic change is, of course, yet another question. i can think of a ton of things that would be higher on my personal list."
11/21/2010,"has anyone actualy bothered to read the eve history?when initiating warp: your internal warp drive opens a wh whilst also contacting the ""locust signature"" of your destination.a tunnel is formed (from both your ship and the locusr sig) meating in the middle,as you pass through the tunnel your ship appears to travel in a streight line when infact it is traveling in a curve to its destination.this is also the same way gates and capital jump drives acomplish there jumps (but on a larger scale)the idear about distorting the back drop around a warp field would work just fine"
11/21/2010,nope.
11/21/2010,"while i was looking at at the issues, i realized that #82, and #83 are the same recommendation.perhaps a discussion on rolling those two together is in order?"
11/21/2010,people... lowsec is not a place for noobs.
11/21/2010,it is if the people in low sec want victims.
11/21/2010,this may have been proposed in the past but i believe this is a very interesting way of clearing up some lag and add an interesting dynamic to eve. the ships that are flown in eve are getting bigger. i believe ships can be flown by one character but to fully utilize its potential it would need additional characters on board to work certain mechanics. for example a carrier for battle should have the pilot which would operate the flying and certain guns and another character to operate drones and another set guns. you could have other parameters set to how the ship would operate. this would help on lag without having the cpu to calculate for all the ships by each individual character. instead it would reduce the amount of ships yet have the same amount of people to the battle. i think this would be awesome to have multi piloted ships especially in battle. now with all that said.... you would be able to fly around with the ship without having to have additional characters on board. but for battle and industrial aspects to fully work you would have to have additional characters.that is my proposal and i really would like to see something like this. i think it would work and become an interesting aspect of the game.thanks for you attentionbigred seven
11/21/2010,"i've seen this proposal before, and it is a both fun and cool proposal, but it would require some rather large changes to game mechanics, and i'm not sure how that'd work out...half-support from me."
11/21/2010,the reason why this is currently un-codeable is that it runs into the same code limitations that carriers have in the fact they cannot carry piloted ships. the entire game code would require a major overhaul for just this purpose (if it is ever implemented)
11/21/2010,"i've noticed that you never see ships like the rohk or hyperion in missions, why not work them into the existing missions?"
11/21/2010,"mostly because there are no faction skins for those models. theres a navy, eom, and blood skin already made for the tier 1 and tier 2 amarr bs, for example, but none currently for the tier 3 (abaddon) would be nice to see the tier 3 bs worked in to the current missions, but i'd much rather see dev time being spent on other issues at hand. i give this proposal a half-support."
11/21/2010,abbadon in mission
11/21/2010,"it's pretty simple really, and someone might have already proposed it, but i'll give a brief preamble. in the current environment of capitals online, motherships (supercarriers) are king, followed shortly by titan doomsday. many proponents would claim this is evidence why dreads should get an hp buff, but i disagree: the doomsday is designed with this specific purpose in mind. instead, to make dreadnaughts once again viable in capital combat, the chance of saving a dread needs to be increased, as even one mothership can easily melt a dread in 10 minutes, pull out of a close range dread's optimal in 10 minutes easily, and of course is untacklable, save unique circumstances. in times before dominion, dreadnaughts would slug it out with the faint glimmer of hope that they are primaried at the end of their siege cycle, allowing the carriers to repair them, slowing down the attrition rate their side suffered. dominion rendered this entirely pointless. tyrannis worsened it by ensuring that these dated machines were now very costly liabilities. in order to get back the viability of dreadnaughts, i propose the following.--------------------------------------- dreadnaughts siege timer is reduced to 4-5 minuteswhen lucky repair cycles and nailbiting countdowns for siege timers are reinstated, the overall gameplay of all capital engagements will be improved.thank you for your time, and please consider my proposal."
11/21/2010,i think the siege timer should be 5 minutes but not for the reasons listed. eve has simply reached a point where anything a dread sieges for can usually be accomplished in under 10 minutes with the amounts of capitals we are seeing. no reason to have a fleet sitting there staring at a reinforced ihub/station/pos for five minutes while they wait to come out of siege.
11/21/2010,yes please :d
11/21/2010,yeah its on my agenda.
11/21/2010,"triage was dropped to 5 minutes a while back for basically the same reason. the same should be done for siege. i think we also need to lessen the penalties on sieing and adding some additional benefits. to start, i'd completely remove the tracking and scan resolution penalty. in fact, i think sieging should give a tracking bonus rather than a penalty, much like how triage boosts scan resolution by 900%. a sieged dread should be able to fight moving carriers and bs's. the draw back is you're stuck there for a while and can't be rr'd. just my thoughts on the matter though."
11/21/2010,"so add your support, dad."
11/21/2010,"supported, yo"
11/21/2010,"they need to get some kind of buff.. right now, they are useless other than shooting structures. so, they should get buffed by either giving them more hp, or more dps. i personally would like ot see them get a dps buff, and be able to target more than 2 targets in siege. if you increase their dps to say 10k with only t2 mods, then they may be usefull again. sure, that dps is rather high, but if you leave them with the same hp, they can still be melted pretty quick by supers, and still instapopped by a dd unless they are tanked specifically for that damage type.dreads take a bit to train for, they may as well be usefull if you have to spend all that time to train for one..."
11/21/2010,"if u actually take pride in contributing to .01% of your fleet in most of your kills, then i have a solution. train an alt to farm kills on. no waiting for unsuspecting cannon fodder or cat and mouse and u don't need anyone else to help either so u'll be singlehandedly doing it all and it only requires the same amount of effort. u can even failfit your alt's ships and get your buddies to laugh at it!"
11/21/2010,remove kms from game and pvp would get better
11/21/2010,eve dev logistics on killmail kb modhave fun.oh... and btw. as a logi pilot myself - not supported.
11/21/2010,"lots of ways to get logis on kms if you want, the whole point is not to. why would i want to announce ""hey guis i use 1230942830 logi alts"" (*cough* insti *cough*) when the current system rewards success and ambiguiety."
11/21/2010,"just assign drones to km *****s... i did it and it works great.. get 5 combat drones, assign each individual drone to a different *****. problem solved."
11/21/2010,"1. if logistics should get you on killmails, they should also cause aggression.2. that would mean you would give up the ability to jump/dock when ever you get primary.you really wanna give up that ability for being on killmails?"
11/21/2010,"file a petition from the eve support tab left to this post or if you can't find it, create a trial account and petition from there."
11/21/2010,they dont reply or have not replied to two seperate petitions
11/21/2010,makes sense to me
11/21/2010,could be an interesting idea
11/21/2010,horrible idea. but then again this is yaay so supers are fine.
11/21/2010,"i would support this idea only under one condtion ( as supers are living coffens atm) and thats the removal of cynos, if a ship needs to calculate calcualtions to jump and it takes 3+ hours to do it its shouldnt need a becon or else all the work is allready done"
11/21/2010,"jesus yaay you realize that many times you need to use a midpoint, your idea not only forces a person to play for 3 hours just to move to a new system it makes it takes 6 hours to get somewhere if there is a midpoint. this is an awful awful awful idea. remember when you said ""i have no idea why bfm dislikes me!"" idiocy like this yaay. idiocy like this"
11/21/2010,"bfm?btw, you do realize the goal is to limit what supers do right? they need to be a commitment which they are not. the 2 account thing is a joke of a commitment. it's not a good thing that supers can move across eve in 20 minutes. if supers want to be deployed directly into action, then they should need some proximity in the first place. regular capitals should have the freedom to do the daily bull****."
11/21/2010,you really don't see how this is an awful awful idea?
11/21/2010,agreeing with a goon. *thumbs down*
11/21/2010,"yaay is a joke, much like this suggestion."
11/21/2010,deploying a super to the front lines from your home base?hope you've got a few days.
11/21/2010,sounds like an excellent idea. please visit your user settings to re-enable images.
11/21/2010,"three hours is way too long and it needs to be associated with aggression, eg. unable to jump for 1 hour after engaging in offensive operations.but; it doesn't actually solve anything, merely makes using supers a pain in the arse. the super blob will still trump any other available strategy with a comfortable margin and does nothing to mitigate the ridiculousness of supers being used outside null to gank bs/sub-bs.good idea as part of a solution but by no means a stand-alone."
11/21/2010,"as opposed to the current system, where supercapitals are as fast to deploy over long distances as interceptors? just like in the real world, where aircraft carriers are just as fast as f-18's. if supercaps are intended to be a strategic weapon, then there should be strategic consequences to deploying them, and there should be ways for clever enemies to exploit errors in their deployment.i am not saying the op's suggestion is the best way to do this, but it is worthy of serious discussion."
11/21/2010,the caps can be in one system every 10-15 minutes. an interceptor can hop between systems at will. these are different kinds of mobility entirely.
11/21/2010,"anything with a jump drive deploys at the same general speed. supers a bit slower than some due to their limited range. as for the real world, i'm still waiting for functional immorality via ftl cloning. bubbles and counter attacks seem like a tactical and a strategic dynamic that can screw with super deployment."
11/21/2010,horrible idea from a terrible person.
11/21/2010,"counter attacks maybe, bubbles no unless you know they are coming and their cyno is a complete tard with a shiny complex and makes the cyno in the middle of the bubble. a hic or dic will melt the moment a mom gets a lock on them pretty much, and mobile bubbles will tend to die faster then they can come on line. there needs to be capital sized points to lock them down. both as a cap mod and a tower mod. sure if its traveling solo. you are going to tell me that they don't travel in packs, most likely with remote energy to boost eachother to move faster?"
11/21/2010,it still takes 10 or so minutes even with the supercaps circle jerking capacitor. if you have a group of archons or chimeras devoted only to this then maybe you can do it in 7 minutes. but an interceptor can still get around much faster.also dictors and hictors dont immediately melt anymore as fighter bombers do nearly nothing to subcaps come the 30th.
11/21/2010,"what i would suggest is if you're down in null, or at war don't be in space or out of a player owned structure when you're away or busy. yes they would see that you're not paying attention but they would also have to beat guns or a station in order to kill you."
11/21/2010,i think you meant to post that comment elsewhere
11/21/2010,not supported. i just can't bring myself to grief the blob chasing me by denying their killmail they camped so hard to get. that would make all of them sad. idk about u but i just can't live with that much suffering on my conscience.
11/21/2010,they usually do that dont they?
11/21/2010,"it would be incredibly useful if there was some way to differentiate between those posts and legitimate 'contenty' ones, particularly for the purposes of dev-finder functions (like on eve-search).please could such posts have a different band colour (green?) and be flagged differently"
11/21/2010,"i'd just like to see them gone because i'm sick of having to wade through this dumb crap to find actual serious contracts. besides, if everyone started paying attention like you want, it would have the exact same effect as if ccp just removed them, iow, their posting would be pointless."
11/21/2010,"pls explain how ccp ""just remove them""(btw i note this is yet another of your make eve easier/safer for me posts)"
11/21/2010,"you mean something like ""block contracts from this person"" option that is already in the game?scams are legitimate in eve. get used to it and try to be more careful.and please don't be immature and/or lazy and use the price range filter for an item that you are searching. it's there for a reason. also, always filter by item type and never use item description filter.all the tools are already there. you just have to use them."
11/21/2010,if you get scammed in eve it is 100% your fault. there are numerous game mechanics in place to protect yourself
11/21/2010,anna... i get the feeling that you haven't read all of the economic reports or followed the economic forum posts that carefully over the last year.here's a great recent developer post for reference that solved a lot of things that were being speculated on for years:
11/21/2010,"1. it's u who's not getting it and needs to re-read the comments to my posts and maybe it will become clear.that was the first post that de-railed the real argument with another and it was far from the last. because the op's immediate assumption of isk faucets being a problem is false--it's the material faucets, explained below. u want to blame someone, blame the idiots like yourselves that whine about me unmasking the intent of your semantics that u continuously de-rail with and hide behind for the sole purpose of hiding the truth.2. u already stated yourself that too much flow from the material faucets will result in hyperdeflation. look at the dropped ship prices compared to pre-tyrannis's t1 insurance nerf. many ppl warned it would happen and it did. with just one isk faucet nerfed combined with oversaturation of minerals, that's proof enough that if any faucet is the problem, it's the material faucets, not the isk faucets (yes, these r your definitions too).3. so thx for helping to prove yourselves wrong. u're not fooling anyone except the other idiots crying over semantics, grammar, spelling, and everything else irrelvant to ""muddy up the argument"". but grats on both accomplishments, especially the latter. next."
11/21/2010,"refer to my previous post because all u've offered in your wall of irrelevant text r your own opinions and figures on how much ""richer"" u r with no unbiased proof. and even if what u say is true, it only disproves the op's erroneous assumption that isk faucets r somehow the problem, rather than the material faucets. it's really the reverse and your post only confirms it. good job."
11/21/2010,"i think one vitaly important aspect gets overlooked in all of the discussions of isk value, inflation, faucet amounts etc.ccp has and continues to tweak the bounty rates (i bet they turn up and down the average bounty of spawns weekly) and has with patchs changed the asteroid generation rates and drop types in a way to maintain relatively stable prices on any broad basket of items. (well, yes t2 had a long slide....it was fairly orderly though... and the pi stuff really has been shaking out of control .... they don't get it all right by any means).what gets overlooked is that technology marches forward, and unlike our world, where the ipod doesn't sell much more than a sony walkman did for in 1985 despite its vastly greater capacity , utilty in size and betteries etc.in eve, the ipod would sell for 5 times as much, so people would need 5 times as much isk. the sums of isk needed for a t3 ship and the ablity for players to afford them poinot to far more isk per player, even if the cost of a thorax or carcal stayed the same 5 million or so isk which probably represented a pretty decent ship in 2007.in d&d i think we refered to ""high entropy"" and ""low entropy"" worlds. a +2 +2 sword and 100 gold pieces might be great in one dungeon masters world and wortheless in another world where dungeon masters handed out +5 +5 swords and 1000s of gold pieces.if you hand out both more curency and higher value items, you can maintain price stabilty but still make the currency of less value to a given player."
11/21/2010,"my point was that neither isk faucets nor material faucets are a problem but, i was giving the op the benefit of the doubt to try to recognize the problem that they felt existed. (i took the complaint to be that there was too much wealth entering the world and some needed to be removed )to me, a statement doesn't mean anything without an elaboration of how one got to the opinion...i tried.. sometimes thats called a wall of text i guess"
11/21/2010,"1. news flash--op never responded. idk why u'd expect him to at this point.2. it's a wall of text when there r simple forum complaints to buff faucets and nerf sinks and market price comparisons to prove one's point, namely mine."
11/21/2010,are you referring to the idea itself needed better explanation or the text i added........... if youre talking the idea itself i cant do much more as its pretty self explanatory.if youre talking the text well........this module is used for the detection and removal of salvage class items from any space wreck deemed usable by the device itself. due to concord regulation <insert a number here> salvage is more or less worthless until someone takes the time to remove it from a ship as until it is removed its just space junk. it is there for not counted as loot under the same regulation and as such follows a first come first serve aspect to ownership of the material in question.
11/21/2010,and with 2 plexes you would get a 30 days personal concord escort whenever you went to low and null!not!
11/21/2010,good suggestion!
11/21/2010,"thanks for the suggestions, i already had most of them in my list of potential combinations that csm will be discussing.my current plan is to publish both the raw results and the results with certain items combined into general categories, like ui, factional warfare, aggression issues, missions and agents, etc.if you find more things that you think should be combined, please post in the main voting thread, it will make it easier for me to find them."
11/21/2010,"i'm sure this idea has probably been tossed out there before, but i figure i could refresh it.jita is always full of scammers and spammers making local chat pretty ridiculous at times. i spend a lot time in jita and i like reading local, apart from the two types of chat mentioned. so i do the only thing i can to filter the junk out: i block a lot of people as i'm sure many others do.so my idea was this: if a person is a constant annoyance to everyone else by spamming local with scams or whatever, and they get blocked by say 100+ people then that person should be blocked by the system from speaking in local.if you agree that a policy like this should be implemented by ccp go ahead and reply to this.thanksjackie cane"

11/21/2010,"for blaster ships, the problem is located in her rather weak ability to actually fill the role they once had. there isn't much wrong with the role itself(close range solo/small gang ships).1. damage, the damage advantage is not big enough to justifies the huge range lose or to make glass cannon damage dealer useful. the numbers would be 15-20%.2. speed/agility they need to be a bit more agile to speed up and slow down quicker. this allows more precision where for movement in web range and puts you in a better situation if it comes to catch stuff quickly. they also need to be quicker, by boosting base speed what would improve shield tanked blaster pvp a lot or simply to remove the penalty's from active tanking armor rigs(and shield ones if you are at it). 10% more speed or change the rigs. same goes to agility. i somehow would love both ways, since it would improve active tanks a lot or would give shield tanked blaster pvp a lot more edge in the skirmish role since it mixes high speeds with high dps.3. web strength is insufficient to make point blank favouring the close range ship if you consider it as high end damage dealer or solo/small gang ship. a bonus to web strength on all blaster ships(excluding frigs) to archive 75% on t1 and 90% on t2 hulls would go a long way to make point blank again a attractive combat range in blaster ships. this would give blaster ships back the ability to pin stuff down, control range, flawless damage projection at point blank and somewhat release them from the pain of smaller ships immobilize you at your combat range. it is ok that you can't catch everything with it(never was this way) or that range + speed will be very effective against you(ever was this way). however close range pvp handed out a very unforgivable combat environment what was a very good thing since it migrated the blaster disadvantages very good and allowed to play out your advantages(raw damage + flawless damage projection).also lol csm."
11/21/2010,"there are ways to resolve this. rather than complaining post-facto, become involved in the discussions while they'r still in feature & ideas or assembly hall. if you dislike an idea, get onto the thread discussing the idea and post your reasons for disliking the idea. the aim is to persuade other players to see your point of view. being able to vote ""no"" will not help you as much as you think it will. being able to write a coherent argument against an idea you don't like will help you far more.this involves rational thinking and presenting facts to support your argument, not simply posting your opinion and calling everyone who disagrees with you an ""idiot"". as a start, keep this list of fallacious arguments handy and make sure you don't invoke any of these argument styles."
11/21/2010,thanks for clearing that out trebor
11/21/2010,"also, keep in mind that ccp has many teams, so for us to be yelling ""fix lag!"" does not preclude us from also yelling ""fix the eve font!"" -- the people likely to be working on those issues will have little overlap. and for me at least, the ui is as big an issue as lag (i'm an old fart and the font hurts my eyes more than you young whipper-snappers).yeah, if there's one killer feature incarna should have, it's the ability to get out of your pod, walk to a window, and look outside."
11/21/2010,"not to quibble, but if there's one killer feature that incarna should have it's the ability to go to a store, buy a gun, and then go and kill some of the other pod pilots you can find wandering around the station."
11/21/2010,"btw nothing i say here is intended to disparage the csm. they are doing a great job. the idea behind this assembly hall thread is a good one - but the implantation made it worthless.the fact that you can't vote against something or put any weight to certain issues makes it worthless. any issue that is very contentious will get a bunch votes. so ccp and csm will not see just how many people really don't want that change. the docking games issue that they want ccp to address is a good illustration. some people like, griefers, mercenary corps and others who love to camp stations for whatever reason. (and i admit there can be many good reasons) like the idea. but many others who like to just fly around in eve in smaller gangs or solo hate it. and by the way looking out a window wont help. that ceptor will point you and the blob will be aligned to the station a split second warp away.so what happens when you look at this issue? well only the people who like the idea have a vote. you hate it? to bad your view is silenced. anyone who is not a troll may be able to recognize this is not the way to go. the other issue that you can vote for up to 20 issues or your just wasting your vote and beyond that you start to diminish your value. thats a bit of a stretch. look how many people happened to have exactly 20 issues or fewer as opposed to over 20 issues. 20 issues is too much. if you had diminishing returns for each vote then you would see many fewer votes. players dont really care about allot of those issues but if they had to vote or waste a vote they may say sure whatever.before you say the results will be the same anyway  let me just say you dont know that. the only way to know is to actually do a good survey where the players can give meaningful input and then compare the results. should i do another? this is another bad idea. here is the thread that the csm is going to somehow take into account when presenting issues to ccp. here is a thread by a random player. which one should we vote in? csm needs to be the one to put this vote on. not random players.trebors response that they didnt just use these results is sort of beside the point. i mean im glad you didnt just use the results entirely but thats because they are worthless. but why use a worthless vote at all?again, i have nothing against trebor indeed i am very impressed with his work at csm. something like this vote thread had to be done and trebor stepped up and set it up. no good deed goes unpunished!the only reason i am posting in this thread is because the op is basically correct about the vote. i hope that if they ever do anything else to try to gauge player support it will be much improved."

11/22/2010,"thanks for the support everybody.against the forced selectivity. i think we come from different backgrounds, maybe in great fleet battles that would be a good compromise as you wouldn't get much out of 150 vectors anyway. but in a small gang i need the info immediately, once i lock eone the battle is 90% over.moreover, there's a better way to present the kind of information you seek: you should imo be able to select 100 ships and see the average or median vectors. but i'll leave that proposal up to you finally the two ideas are not exclusive to each other, i need them all, you need a selection, the solution is obvious: make the choice box for activating this feature a drop down combo instead (vectors: no (default)/all/selection only).please also keep in mind, regarding clutter, that the proposal asks for the option of selecting vectors based on the overview status, as already happens for ships and drones. you can remove your fleet's ships vectors for example, or keep only those if you are a logistics pilot."
11/22/2010,this would only help eve to be a better and--more importantly--far more fun game as it helps pilots to achieve greater immersion and strategically provocative gameplay. supported.

11/22/2010,"suicide ganking isn't pvp. it's manipulation of game mechanics to kill individuals who have no means of fighting back while avoiding a meaningful risk/reward scenario. it's griefing, pure and simple. and while some griefing is reasonable and acceptable because the victim is required to take action to initiate the response (ie canflipping, salvage stealing)... suicide ganking completely takes any control or prevention away from the victim.standing hits should be enormous and there should be no insurance payouts. you want to know what carebear is? it's attacking a defenseless target in mass numbers knowing you can't possibly lose, and knowing that your reward payout is always going to be higher than the cost of an insured ship. it's a joke."
11/22/2010,"1. there's no manipulation or risk-aversion but u could say the same thing with blobs, and they don't automatically forfeit their ship whether they get a kill or not.2. as for griefing, refer to #1.3. wrong again--prevention involves not making yourself an appealing target.aka blobs so either insurance for all or none. simple as that.yet another idiot who thinks suicide ganking is somehow different than any other pvp."
11/22/2010,"supported. you do not get insurance money irl if you make your car into a car bomb or use it in a terrorist act. it makes no sense that you would in game.sand box or not, the mechanics should have some form of coeherency, and getting insurance payments for ships lost to concord makes no sense in any frame whatsoever.in fact the current system is akin to a subsidy to terrorist behavior. not anything any police or public would condone, and again, entirely nonsensical from a game lore, and playeability sense.this does not get rid of a legitimate form of play as some supporters of the current nonsense would put it, it merely removes a subsidy that artificially makes gankes much more profitable than they should be."
11/22/2010,"you are completely and utterly wrong, and being called an idiot by a ****** isn't exactly going to hurt my feelings. if you are blobbed by a target, you are blobbed by that target specifically because you have put yourself in a situation that allows you to be blobbed. either your in nulsec, your in lowsec, your being wardecced, your in fw, you attacked someone who flipped a can, or stole a wreck, etc etc. in all those cases you are 99.9% of the time going to be fitted and prepared for pvp(unless your an idiot). in 99.9% of those situations, you could have did something to prevent yourself from ending up in that situation in the first place. this isn't how it works with suicide ganks. you can try to not make yourself as appealing of a target, but that isn't a solution. it doesn't prevent anything, its merely a deterrent. most suicide gangers will blow up an empty tengu just to pad their killboards, and there is nothing that that pilot can do to prevent it(outside of not flying nice ships, which is a ****ing stupid solution). now that in and of itself, is bull****...but i can deal with it. what i can't deal with is how the actual cost to the suicide gankers is almost nothing. everyone always wants to laud the whole risk/reward scenario... but its totally out of wack in the case of suicide ganking. it's 95% reward and 5% risk, and its stupid. meanwhile, flying around with a deadspace/faction fit mission ship is 90% risk, and 10% reward... again, its stupid.what is the point of faction mods & deadspace modules if they only make you a massive target for groups of people risking next to nothing. in my opinion, if you want to go after that +billion isk ship, your ass better be ready to lose big if you fail... and you need to get a standing punishment that severely limits your ability to be a repeat offender. that's how risk/reward is suppose to work.pvping is fighting people that have placed themselves in a scenario where they are prepared to pvp by their own actions. it might not be fair, but that person placed themselves in a pvp situation. i've put a lot of hours in nulsec, and i think suicide ganking is absolutely pathetic. it's the equivalent of a group of men picking a fight with a guy in handcuffs with his back turned, and then patting themselves on the back when they kick his ass... its pathetic."
11/22/2010,"look, realistically, if the police had to wreck your car to stop you from doing something illegal, your insurance company would not pay up. this may be a sandbox, but it's still a sandbox based on rules and logic."
11/22/2010,"same thing with suicide ganking. this isn't world of warcraft, where lines r drawn. undocking is what sets u up for pvp, not going into low sec, etc. and making yourself an appealing target is what triggers it. idiots like u always make that misconception. but then again, that covert ops frigate should scout with guns instead of a cloak, right?correction: 100% risk/chance of ship loss used for suicide gank. but lemme get this straight--since using faction ships/mods make u an appealing target, not using them as a safety measure is stupid? hahaha seriously, this is why no one respects carebears like u--when it's believed to be impossible, u've achieved a new level of stupidity. u never cease to amaze us.this is eve, not world of warcraft...again. low sec is not the designated battleground and high sec is not the designated sanctuary. do yourself and get rid of that stupid mentality. it's all non-consensual pvp and what u're describing is all the same, whether it's blob, gate camp, or suicide gank. wake up and get used to it."
11/22/2010,getting insurance for a lost ship due to suicide ganks or self destruct is a nonsense. insurance company would not pay in real life
11/22/2010,"police or not, the insurance company ""realistically"" wouldn't pay up either way if u brought it into a war zone and got it shot up. that pretty much answers the 18351519650 posts using that same flimsy excuse."
11/22/2010,"very supported. atm suic ganking is a totally brainless activity that uses loopholes in insurance to make pretty much any hit profitable. the amounts you make from this are disproportionately high, and the risk, nonexistent.no insurance for concorded ships, or self destructed seems a good way to at least put some thought into the situation."
11/22/2010,deleted for double posting.

11/22/2010,"i don't mine much, but this might make mining more interesting."
11/22/2010,"i don't support many of the specific ideas since they seem to make mining in noob space (i.e., highsec) too profitable compared to mining in lowsec or player-sec (nullsec), but i agree with the op's general proposal that ccp should devote resources to making mining more interesting than clicking a rock and pressing f1."
11/22/2010,"i fully support the replacement of asteroid belts with exploration sites. this was discussed some time ago - at the time the devs suggested a different mechanic to probing since probing was ""hard"", but in the meantime we get given probing skills, training and a free probing ship during the career training. probing is easy these days.i also like the idea of increasing the utility of the survey scanner. the miners could choose between simply mining every single rock, or manually selecting just the richest, most profitable rocks to mine, after which they leave the site and some short time later the site despawns.increasing the required manual interaction for optimal yield will help make mining a little more interesting."
11/22/2010,"don't do a lot of mining myself, for this very reason. it's tedious.it could stand to be made a lot more involved and interesting."
11/22/2010,supported on the basis that mining sucks and shouldn't suck as much.
11/22/2010,"not dying of boredom is a good thing, you have my support."
11/22/2010,"i agree that mining needs a makeover which is the only reason i support this, but seeing as it is the second most practiced thing in the game, it should require developer resources and it should be done, in part, to counter macros and make mining more exciting and complex. m y corp likes the idea of mining and of being a mining corp but as it is, it's just so damned boring and easy.shooting things is never as easy as just locking a target and pushing fire and mining should not be that easy either."
11/22/2010,"amen to that!i for one believe that many of the problems of mining could be solved by making it more labor intensive. at the moment, all most miners do is watch their lasers cycle (and many don't even have the patience for that, stealth miner anyone?).i am not sure what should be done, but it looks like csm at least has gleaned some ideas from the community, and are willing to expand on them. there is a ""general discussion on mining"" on the november 2010 prioritization crowd sourcing page. and while i'm not wild about voting on the ""we want to talk about it"", option, its better than nothing."

11/22/2010,supported. would be helpful in pvp to be able to see your target's manuvering without losing perspective on your own ship
11/22/2010,"agree, only if its optional.on slower computers this would decrease performance drastically on the client side, especially if we are talking about fleet battles."
11/22/2010,supported.the technology to do this was put in place when they made ship preview and fitting screen 3d render. the devs said so. now they just have to add it as per the op's request.

11/22/2010,"you seem to have skipped the first sentence in my post, and thus the entire purpose of the post. i put it in bold this time for you. the point i'm making is that no t1 cruiser is designed to easily be fit with t2 weapons.400mm plates are the equivalent to medium shield extenders (hp-wise). 800mm plates are the equivalent to large shield extenders (hp-wise). 1600mm plates are one of the many reasons why armor tanks are better buffer tanks than shield.oh really? a specious argument. the only two ships i'm aware of that can accomplish this are the thorax and the vexor. thorax is a complete eft warrior ship as the medium blasters + 800mm plate mean it never gets into range of anything. vexor is alright, but drone damage isn't a good choice for most pvp situations when flying cruiser-sized ships."
11/22/2010,"lse+425mm kiting stabber fits fine with tech 2 weapons. so does the 425mm, 800mm plate rupture and the 180mm, 1600mm plate rupture. the vexor and thorax can be fit all tech 2 as well. so can the lse blaster moa and the lse assualt missile caracal.and what do all the 800mm 1600mm and lse modules have in common. they fit on the:stabberrupturethoraxvexormoaarbitratorassualt caracalbellicoseblackbird.without power grid and cpu.the others fit at low skill without need to use as much high meta, the fitting demands on the omen are to much. it is something to say when a ship that has everything going for it: slot layout, weapons, drone bay, dmg bonus.and yet it is the least used direct combat cruiser in the game do to terrible fitting issues."
11/22/2010,posting to confirm the omen sucks.supported.
11/22/2010,"ok, sorry to ruin the good moods here, but that's simply not being realistic. what's proposed wouldn't ""solve"" much.tq's db has just undergone a major upheaval where item's identifiers went from 32 to 64 bits apiece. that means there was need for room for more than 4.3 billion stacks(*) of this and that. then we ask for a new stat on ships? maybe modules too? even if they account to a mere quarter of the 4.3b items (a single asteroid is an item, after all, and i'm sure at least a few of us are still trying to cover tristram with gold over ;) in the really happy hypothesis that the proposed stats can hold within 4 ints, that's adding at least 4tb to the db (may easily be tripled or quadrupled depending on the views). not to mention the pair of months to implement the structural modifications to the data model, still not taking into account developping the actual game mechanics in the first place.and that would just be for the db. next in line comes the cluster load. i don't know, but i read here and there that sols can already have a hard time in case of big engagements. do you want to add up to that with a mechanism that will have to keep track of a lot of things?besides, we're talking of a system oriented towards really-long-flown ships only. the vast majority of ships in the game, i believe (i may be wrong), get blown long before insurance expiration delay. (now that would be some things to ask for some qen: what percentage of ships are insured, how many insurance contracts outlive their 12 weeks...)(*) by the way, how do you propose to impact repackaging stuff, if you can't bring it back to pure mint condition?as you might say, those are not in any case good reasons per se to reject the proposal. they're just part of the reasons why it would be ""quite impractical"" to set up (did some people before me mention customer's dissatisfaction? ;-p )on the other hand, i think we can perfectly contend with ""indefinite & perfect rejuvenation"" of our beloved gear.some might not have seen the olden days when things were made to last, but it's even rumored that there once were people that erected buildings that would do really well even after 25 hundreds of years ;) the fact that we've been raised in a society, the ecomics of which somehow govern that it is more profitable to induce people to replace their stuff every so often, doesn't make it any kind of some universal rule, don't you think? ;)then there's this magical utopia of technological progress: we (in real life) are already on the verge of being able to re-grow organic structures for replacement and stuff. why should it be more difficult for mechanical parts? things that we design and manufacture and, as such, understand inside-out. how it is done i don't care, and if you do you'll have to tell me about nitrogen and oxygen tanks in every ship too, and that would just be an appetizer ;-pone step further: i disagree that higher-tech stuff should wear out less than common stuff, for at least two reasons. high-tech stuff is more refined than plain stuff, that's part of what makes it more powerful, but also comes at the price that it can be broken by a grain of sand where it would have taken a full stone otherwise (eg ""tin barbs"" on miniaturized solderings). that's it for ideology. now for economics (as in pvp), having the feature weight more on tech1 stuff would be like imposing a tax on noobishness."
11/22/2010,"this is true.. except spaceships aren't just one thing.take my computer. it's a case from 7 years ago, a dvd drive from 5 years ago, a motherboard, ram and cpu from 2 years ago, and a psu and hdd from about 4 months ago. i'm using a version of windows i bought about 6 years ago. my speakers are as old as the case, and my lcd, that's maybe a year and a half old. a while ago my graphics card from maybe 2 years ago bit the dust. soon i'm getting a new one, but i'll still hang on to every other part of my computer.after that i'll probably replace the motherboard, cpu and ram. then maybe the dvd drives. depends how long they all last. the case will probably eventually get replaced. i need new speakers.this is my computer, less than one m^3.how many parts do you think my 600m long hulk has in it?"
11/22/2010,"meh..i support this half way. i say ships degrade if you have to repair while in structure. everytime you repair in structure -.1% get's knocked off all the ships stats. until it hits a maximum of -99%you can get rid of this negative and ""overhaul"" the ship back to 99% at overhaul facilities for 50% of the cost of the ship. or at player owned overhaul facilities that use 50% of the materials needed to build the ship.if your ship manages to hit 0% it just falls apart and you get 1 tritanium from the ""ship scrapping service"""
11/22/2010,"do want, if ships stored in hangars wouldn't suffer ageing.only equipment in use should age.what kind of figure we're talking about here anyway?complete replacement after 1,000 hours usage? (a year has 8,760hrs)for example.. you pilot a hulk 6 hours a day, every day.. 166.7 days later (5.5 months) you would need a new one/complete repair.if you play on weekends.. maybe roaming in a fleet for 10 hours total each.. that's 100 weekends or nearly 2 years.can we weave ship-crews into this somehow?overall a nice idea for mineral/products sink for the miners/industrialists out there..i mean, pvp/nullsec peeps shouldn't have a problem at all, their stuff asplodes way before the time is up anyway. if you quit the game for a while your stuff wont suffer ageing too, no penalty there. if you use your stuff often - get used to it getting worn out."
11/22/2010,"it will not generate a isk sink, it will generate a material sink making the old ships useless. buying stuff from another player don't remove isk from the system (beside the station tax), it move isk from player a wallet to player b wallet. so the effect of your idea would be a strong push for inflation, with an increase in value of minerals (as you need more of them to replace the ships). same thing for ""items"" (modules, drones, probes, ecc., maybe even implants i suppose). beside that keeping track of the ""wear and tear"" of every item in eve would slow down the database even after the upgrade it has received."
11/22/2010,"hm, what about character aging then? thinking of it...""my 10 foot beard > your shaved noob chin, dude!"""
11/22/2010,"+1 supported. i never want to see the day where i come on the website and see***system-wide damage titans for 30 plex!!! get them while their hot!!****well that might not happen, but you get the gist. ccp will eventually do whatever they want, but this gu"
11/22/2010,i agree with you make it so people don't get a edge
11/22/2010,bump
11/22/2010,"really like the idea but to not make it overcomplicated i think it should be just one button to switch between two modes mode one being: high alpha, low tracking, high cap use, low dps* mode two being: high firing rate, hight tracking, low cap use, high dps*or we could make it complicated and give a bunch of sliders with which you can change all the parameters around those sliders would affect each other of curse cap slider: slider set for minimum cap use would set all others in the middle* tracking/range slider: set low would give high tracking but lower range and vise versa* alpha/dps slider: set low would give high alpha but low dps and vise versa /slider at both ends would set the cap use slider to maximum* *or something like that...."
11/22/2010,"as everyone and their warrior ii knows, learning skills are potentially a nearly 6 million sp investment. that can take awhile. i know, i did it (yes even for charisma).the actual proposal is to remove all learning skills (with appropriate sp reimbursements) with the notable exception of the skill actually named 'learning'.learning is a 1x multiplier skill that boosts attributes 2% per level.the new proposed learning skill might be moved to social, but the important thing is to change the bonus to 20% and the multiplier to 2x (the sp reimbursement would be forced to cover this change before it could be spent elsewhere)."
11/22/2010,"so, in effect, reduce the (potentially - not all at once, nor always trained this high) 6m investment to an (almost certain, probably mostly invested at the same time) 0.5m investment?changing it from being 2-3 months maximum (correct me if i'm wrong) to 10-15 days.i like it."
11/22/2010,"supported. covers the ""but its a choice!"" crowd, and gets rid of a terrible system that only serves as a terrible barrier of entry to the game."
11/22/2010,"it's a ""lesser of two evils"" solution.. i'll support it on the grounds that it's better than what we've got, but i still believe we can do better."
11/22/2010,"does your proposal include adjusting everyone's attributes +10, or lowering everyone's attributes when the skills are removed?support as long as everyone gets the same attributes as training the current learnings. making training slower than it is now is not an option."
11/22/2010,"the exact value of the change per level might not be precise, but this is what it would effectively do:10 (base attribute) + 10 (specific attribute learning skills) * 1.1 (old 'learning' skill) = 22and the change would make it:10 (base) * 2 (new 'learning' skill) = 20so maybe 22-25%?"
11/22/2010,yeah it would have to be tuned to end up at the same overall speed or a bit faster but it seems like a good compromise. supported.
11/22/2010,"i see nothing wrong with this, and it makes people really think about choosing their attributes. i support this."
11/22/2010,you all missed the fact that learning also boosts attribute gains from implants. so now my +5's will be +10's? that's balanced!
11/22/2010,"current: (10 + 10 + 5)1.1= 27.5proposal: (10 +5)2= 30maybe that would be a good compromise in favor of a 20% bonus, implantless would lose a little, implanteds would gain a little. either way it decreases overall the current issue in favor of more short term gains."
11/22/2010,"you're still not getting it, but since you're quick with the numbers.tell me the current sp gain per minute gap between a person with +2's and a person with +5's, and then the sp gap between the same with the 20% boost.this is important because many pvp folk use lg implant sets (there are no hg versions for many sets) so are forced to have +2, whereas carebears in hisec have +5's all the time and don't care. even if you don't use pirate implants you can't afford to continually replace +5's or maybe even +4's if you pvp.this is just a boost to highsec and a nerf to nullsec, nothing more."
11/22/2010,"supported, the current system has to go."
11/22/2010,"i've always argued in favor of retaining the learning skills because i do think that after 4-4 they are a real choice in terms of pie now or more pie later. however, the emotions of others must be taken into account and clearly many gamers are min/maxers and would have way too much angst from ""wasting"" potential learning rates that won't reach a break even for 6 months or more... ...well i'll stop.i've been won over to the concept that anything that puts off new players from getting past the first few weeks or months of play, and all of these threads have convinced me that there is a sizable percentage of new players who get fairly put off by the skills.i've always thought that the fees for the level 2 books were far far too high, and even moved towars thinking that plyers should start at 4 - 3but i've come to realize that some nebishes just wouldn't see that its more important to get into a battle cruiser or interecepter a few weeks earlier to start having more fun instead of going up to 5-4 right off and losing maybe a week or so in the first 6 months while in better ships, and taking on the higher levels after you're sure you like the game. the notion of purposely taking a less efficient route just is too appalling to them.so marketing trumps the lesson that fun in this game isn't about relative skill points"
11/22/2010,"that is a problem wih implants, not learning skills. maybe someone should make a prop about it."
11/22/2010,i support
11/22/2010,"background: when someone uses the ""broadcast: location"" function in a fleet, a broadcast is sent to all designated recipients in their fleet window stating the location of whoever issued the broadcast.right-clicking this broadcast brings up a pop-up menu that includes the option distance. selecting this brings up a popup box stating how far away the system is in jumps and light-years. this is an existing feature already on tranquility.proposal: make the distance function available from any right-click menu that involves a specific solar system: star map, bookmarks, et cetera.alternate proposal: make the distance function available when right-clicking a star on the star map."
11/22/2010,"this really isn't needed since all you really need to do is show info>route, and scroll to the bottom. viola. number of jumps to target system.but i'll support it anyway, since no harm can possible come from adding more crap to the right click menu."
11/22/2010,"i support this idea, but it should not directly negate other votes - rather it should simply be another set of data the csm and players may use to determine player temperature on an issue.issue x: yes votes (500), no votes(499) - this is not the same asissue x: yes votes (1), no votes(0)if a huge number of players are in support of an issue, and a huge number are against it - then that issue is important and should be high priority. it also means that the solution presented might not be right, but so many players care about it that it needs to be looked at."
11/22/2010,"how about we make it so anyone can jump to cynos. regardless of being in fleet or alliance/corp the person is in. in the map you can see where cynos exist, but you cant really do anything about it. frankly also logistics and such are easy enough because of cynos. my suggestion is open up cynos for everyone. it makes things easier not requiring fleet and such but the added risk the moment you jump 5 moms are coming in behind you. as for the moms... they are most likely jumping in blind.the way to do it. in the usual right-click hud -> jump to -> list all your typical alliance/corp cynos then very last option can be option to open map which goes to cyno option. then right click on the system and jump to cyno."
11/22/2010,me: hey open a cyno for my jfalliance: ok cyno is lit* i jump *alliance: wtf *insert players here* hotdropped our own cyno.bad idea is bad.
11/22/2010,dear lord no
11/22/2010,"yes lets massively buff supercap gank fleets by allowing them to hotdrop through enemy cynos, this is a truly excellent plan because supercaps are terribly underpowered right now"
11/22/2010,sounds like a nifty plan in order to have lag getting more field days...
11/22/2010,i agree.and logistics being too easy is #1 complaint everyone hears today. this quickly fixes that.
11/22/2010,id rather see the jumpspace expac.the one where ccp gets rid of stargates between regions and constellations and everyone uses fuel to jump to stars (cynos for added range and better target selection).
11/22/2010,"yes, in much the same way as switching off tranquility and setting the servers on fire would fix the problem."
11/22/2010,"well, here, if you want a real boost to bring people in, how about giving low sec npc's (mission or rat) a 10,000 to 1 chance of dropping a plex as loot? a completely random roll that maybe drops a single plex throughout low sec on an npc or 2 every day. hell, even i'd venture there for that chance."
11/22/2010,"i'd be interested to see w-space used as a gate to regions of nullsec that are not connected to current k-space by stargates.wormholes provide a bottleneck that would keep the current nullsec empires from easily taking over such new space, giving it a level playing field and potentially even scoping those nullsec pockets for smaller-scale sovereign states.these new pockets of k-space could be anything from a single system to a full-sized, internally gate-connected region, with npc stations, markets, and everything.it might make for some interesting fiction if this disconnected k-space had different npcs, different minerals, etc., but the ideal appeals to me even if it's just more of the same. it would also be interesting to consider the possibility of high or low security disconnected space, but i think sticking with 0.0 simplifies things (especially trying to explain how concord exists out there)."
11/22/2010,"wouldn't it be more interesting to allow players to place stargates or force wormholes into a semi-permanent state, in *some* w-space systems, allowing alliances to start creating new regions with interesting layouts.it makes more sense than finding a whole new area of space with premade regions and somehow there is already civilisation there."
11/22/2010,"island high-secs do already exist, i'm pretty sure of it least one which requires you to go through null-sec to get to! and guess what? it's practically empty, noone goes there, i only knew about it because our wormhole leads to different high-secs every 24 hours."
11/22/2010,"he's not talking about isolated high security. he's talking about isolated k-space.for example, the jove and developer regions are isolated k-space; they have their own stargate network that players can't get to because it's not connected to the rest of k-space and wormholes don't go to or from there.the original poster is proposing additional isolated k-space pockets that cannot be reached by stargate from empire space, but are available to players via wormholes."
11/22/2010,shameless bumping and supporting own idea. (50 views and no feedback? )
11/22/2010,win!!!!thank you to everyone who voted and posted their comments!!!plex for neural remap has been shelved!!
11/22/2010,easily first \o/
11/22/2010,"congratulations to everyone on letting your paranoia stall out the plans for all neural remaps. you've managed to accomplished exactly what the op expressly said he didn't want this thread to do.this isn't a victory, it's scorched earth as ccp didn't just shelf their plans for plex for remap but all neural changes they were working on."
11/22/2010,something needs to be done about the drone skill because the bonus does not make sense literally and can confuse people like me.also please review all other skills for text problems-such as-example:scout drone operation bonus: drone control range increased by 5000 meters per skill level. even though it says scout drone operation it applies to all drones which makes it confusing. while i first though it only applied to scouts.fix 1:scout drone operation bonus: drone control range increased by 5000 meters per skill level. applies to: all drone typesorwe can just change the namefix 2:basic drone operation allows a pilot to control both light and medium drones. bonus: drone control range increased by 5000 meters per skill level. applies to: all drone typesas you can see it can confuse any newcomer to the drone skill.there probably is a better way to fix this but this needs to be changedjust patch the textjust patch the textjust patch the text
11/22/2010,"well, you cant use heavy or sentry drones without it but yes, the text is horrible."
11/22/2010,"in honor of justin bieber winning big time at the american music awards, i propose the following:for the christmas gift, everyone gets a launcher that when shot at someone, they turn their ship, any any new ship they board, into a giant justin bieber parade ballon. this effect would last for 24hrs and the only way to get ride of the effect is to shoot your launcher at someone else.this will provide many lulz and endless entertainment. this is a non-lethal launcher so shooting random people in high sec should not be a problem."
11/22/2010,"i want to say something mean and snarky. i really do. i can feel the rage building inside of me to nearly grimpak-esque levels.unfortunately, your proposal seems to have robbed my brain of the ability to adequately formulate that rage into words.well played op. well played."
11/22/2010,"i propose that double dee, and any characters on that account get turned into a justin bieber balloon for a year. that should teach this troll a lesson ;)"

11/22/2010,the last thing we need is something in game that would promote that kid.
11/22/2010,i don't think it's super hard to do
11/22/2010,why not
11/22/2010,"what could possibly go wrong?/sarcasmas long as it's not as outrageous and graphic intensive as sensor boosters and eccm, sure."
11/22/2010,and as long there is a button to turn it off separately
11/22/2010,"also give tracking disruptors a separate animation from sensor damps? or make ecm be the same and have that as the generic ""ewar"" animation"
11/22/2010,"lovely that that idea is, the implementation of that idea and the apparent 3rd person effects are just not consistant to whats portrayed in the game.if you're generating a wormhole, wormholes exist to our perspective much like black holes.. a singular point in space... when u travel through it you traverse a higher dimension inside the 3 dimensions we percieve. ccp has shown videos of wormhole style gateways from one image to another. its the same system they use to show the destination system in the graphic for the wormhole ur about to enter. you would not warp in a straight line if you were entering a wormhole. you would appear to shrink into nothing. no one would be able to track what direction u were going.from what i can ascertain, eves 'warp' feature (ahem) seeems to act like a warp bubble around the ship in order to counteract and bend the apparent laws of physics (or the games perception of basic physics).i would like to say that yes its not a major requirement to get this done, its just one of those eve 'features' that ive overlooked for a long time. when id started playing eve, little things like that took my love of it down a notch."
11/22/2010,"actually, what should happen is your computer plots a course and makes a sublight correction to circumvent objects, this could also help remove pvp from gates and stations."
11/22/2010,"the august 2010 prioritization crowdsourcing project included 168 elements. asking players to prioritize that is essentially asking them to sort that list.according to wikipedia, ""most humans when sortingordering a deck of cards, for exampleuse a method that is similar to insertion sort."" on average an insertion sort requires o(n^2) comparisons -- essentially asking a person to choose between 28000 different priorities (besides asking them to reorder their priorities).a more efficient algorithm, such as a binary insertion sort, guarantees an upper bound of n*log(n) comparisons. under the 168 suggestions in the august crowdsourcing competition, this would reduce to a ""mere"" 860 comparisons. it should be simple to implement a tool that could query the user as the comparison argument to a binary insertion sort.if nothing else, it would go a long way toward easing the pain of crowdsourcing, and would likely give more accurate results."
11/22/2010,"it's not a sorting problem, really, except in the most general terms. voters look at those issues that are there, pick n that they feel are important, and then perhaps re-pick from that set to get the ones they most want their votes to go to. put it this way: it's not looking at three decks of cards scattered all over the floor and being told ""put these in order"", it's looking at a menu at a tapas restaurant and being told ""pick a few things to get for lunch."""
11/22/2010,"my ""sorting"" algorithm for crowdsourcing involves o(n) operations. it's not sorting at all, it's filtering.first, go through the whole list and rank the items based on my criteria for improvements to the game (eg: game-breaking stuff gets fixed ahead of requirements that start with ""it would be nice if...""). this rank is basically a ""star rating"".now take the top x ranked items and stick them in a post on the crowdsourcing thread.and remember, when you flip a coin sometimes it's not the heads or tails that matters, it's the realisation of which way you wanted the coin to land."
11/22/2010,"op's solution is a bit excessive, but the crowdsourcing could use somewhat better software support. one annoyance i ran into is that i went through the list, opened a few tabs of things that looked interesting, then went back through the tabs... and none of them listed their issue numbers. had to go back through the list to find the numbers for the issues i wanted to vote on. i'm sure it's also no fun for whoever tallies the votes to have to go through the forum thread counting, either. this system could use some dedicated software, instead of trying to mash everything in through the wiki and forums.actually, a question about that. is this crowdsourcing thing all being done manually by the csms (vote tallies, setting up pages in the wiki, etc), or is ccp providing technical support? if it's being done manually, i can see why that stuff like the issue id numbers on the wiki pages isn't being updated - that's a rather immense amount of work for just a few people."

11/22/2010,"[sorry, delete it]"
11/22/2010,locked per request.
11/22/2010,i think that ccp should go after bot and macro users with more agressive attitude.
11/22/2010,good idea i guess.
11/22/2010,"instead of a jump range bonus it should get a mass reduction bonus of 20% per level. the reason for this is so it can take any wormhole size and of course be able to take wormholes into any security space. imagine the pure awesomeness of have that amazing looking ship at a trade hub in empire, blowing up stuff.this bonus would not only be more fun, but add some flavor to high sec. also have a mechanic that will nto allow you to board the ship if you are in a npc corp."
11/22/2010,i actually agree. this would be an awesome idea and in flavor with the sansha lore. supported as long as even player piloted sansha supercaps have no concord protection.
11/22/2010,"sounds like a nice compromise. maybe have a mechanic that does not let you board the ship unless you are in a player made corporation. also you can't be kicked from a player made corp if you are in space, and ccp refuses to kick players that are in super capitals from corps no matter what. i will update the op. also be sure to give a thumbs up if you like it."
11/22/2010,this has to be a troll
11/22/2010,looks like greed got in the way of the shut down of capsuleer. don't get me wrong i have an iphone and used this app all the time. capsuleer functionity to monitor character skills and status; ccp events and development updates; entertaining community blogs. it was the best. so long capsuleer and thanks for all of the fish.
11/22/2010,"token, we need second layer of protection. account hacking hurt the player/corp/alliance. it concern the hacked player but also is corp/alliance.ccp : its time to protect your players...."
11/22/2010,"i don't get it. i follow the simple rules given in one of the wiki articles (about safe flying or something) and haven't once been killed in low sec. been close, but survived every encounter.mind you, i'm not a pvp person, so i am avoiding all combat rather than seeing if i might win.but i still can't see while people won't read a bit and learn which mistakes not to make."
11/22/2010,boooyou want to see truly depopulated space? look at sov nullsec.
11/22/2010,except everyone who does not like to live in claimable or concord space. oh yeah everyone who lives in low sec. if you want more empire or null sec space then make more of it. as ccp to add systems. but low sec is for people who like to pvp without the politics of null sec. its either low sec of npc null sec. neither one is claimable.
11/22/2010,"i support this.and for all those claiming technical reasons against it, i'd leave such comments to ccp devs. if enough people want it, i'd imagine they would at least consider the feature and its feasibility."
11/22/2010,"why not implent joystick support while we're at it? ;)the idea itself is actually pretty awesome and i can imagine it'd change the way many pilots (thinking mainly interceptor/frigate pilots) navigate/use their ship.i don't really see a downside to this, except for the obvious technical problems that might arise. but as the poster above me said, lets leave that to ccp to determine."
11/22/2010,"while i would love this, it just isn't possible. instead of a node crashing with a few hundred people, it would crash with 20."
11/22/2010,"i'd love to see something like this, or even wasd. there is a way to fly in any direction, double click, so there is at least some implementation of manual controls. now lets try mapping them to something less carpal inducing. speed up/down, pitch up/pitch down, etc does not seem that hard to do. at any rate, id rather let ccp say if it can be done or not, while letting them know that if they do it, i would love it.a reticle i don't think would work at all, but all up for manual flying."
11/22/2010,this is why poses were made modular rather than a single unit.
11/22/2010,they tried this when eve started and the code literally spat it out like it was poison.
11/22/2010,it's always ridiculous. there's a simple solution - minimize local when in jita and pretend that it doesn't exist. that's what i do anyway.
11/22/2010,"any time now. as ""blobbing"" has no definition and is a content-free snarl word, you might not want to hang your hat on that. and as cooperation is part and parcel of game mechanics working as intended, you don't have an argument there, either. generally when we refer to a ""fact"" it has to be something that is, well, factual. what you really are saying is that your subjective disagreement is that some people can cooperate more effectively than you can and can form bigger groups than you. that you try to cast your subjective preference as an objective ""problem"" doesn't make it so. you are lying on both counts.not only have i addressed the risks inherent in cooperation, i've also addressed why your argument is nonsensical as the same exact risks exist in cooperating with one other guy as the guys in your corp as the corps in your alliance as the alliances in your coalition (but of course you're not advocating that ccp nerf the ability for two guys to form a fleet or ten guys to form a corp or two corps to form an alliance or...). to say nothing of the fact that you're committing the fallacy of equivocation and deliberately conflating different types of risk, as if there should be a greater risk to fitting two guns than one, and a much greater risk to fitting eight guns than two. what with those dastardly gun blobbing ships, and all. likewise, i've never claimed that eve is real life, or mentioned iraq or the united states. much like the contradictions that you simply cannot quote (but really, they exist!) you can't quote me doing any of that because you've made it up. if you contend otherwise, quote it. we both know you won't be quoting it, though."
11/22/2010,trolling posts removed. please remain on topic.
11/22/2010,missed the moderation. nvm.
11/22/2010,"to put it straight i was looking forward on this one and was hoping to get it passed; i think it's a bit ridiculous that this affected me and some of my friends who were also planning for it (lol) and how things can impact from a decision of some minority or whoever the body is- i just want to play; have fun- no stress, would i have to worry about what's happening up there just as to how people worry about elections? i don't really mind but i just want to get a word out because i havent really seen a plex for remap support thread or i am just ranting =pwasn't it a win-win decision for both? i mean people do the exact same thing: buying and trading characters, converting plex to isk. but for me i don't really think it would really affect anyone, people would only remap to train faster so that they wouldn't have to wait and ya know waste time. i don't think most would even use real money just to buy the plex for a remap; can't people make enough isk to buy plex's themselves? and then use it them for remap or in whatever they want with it.. remap - one year until you can do it again. but maybe its a good thing, i mean if im an official peep who has lived and played eve for years i wouldnt want anyone to get ahead of me in some form of cheating using real moneyz! but who cares! let them have their own fun! i think that would even mean more pew because of the newbs remapping and more ka***** to ccp.. right? i just think people who have played long enough who thought like this are just sad.. i mean who cares about people using their own money? its their money! advantage-disadvantage, i play the game and we all make isk!speaking of isk, the only problem i saw from this was the plex inflation because of it (maybe), i hope to see it die down back to normal.furthermore about the recent news, could this probably mean some transaction of a sort where people who have money can buy official things separate from people who just want to play the game..? (like wee! look at me i bought my logo because i can!) i hope this doesnt turn into a mini web-browser game who ask $ for official items/options thing.. so was there at least someone who supported this? if so- why would you think it would be good all in all for both sides.tl;dr - remapped hoping plex for remap, recent news turned down.now can we have prices back to 330 again :c"
11/22/2010,"i am still hoping that ccp convert neural remaps to a booster, which can be manufactured by players, and comes in various flavours - e.g.: an illegal variant which reduces the remapping interval to 8 months or so.the soul of the eve economy is player created materials being traded by players to be used by/against players. neural remaps as a game function rather than an in-game effect, and vanity items sold directly from the eve store go against this grain.we'll just wait and see."
11/22/2010,no.
11/22/2010,"the correct decision for the welfare of the entire game and in-game economy has been made after long and hard discussions between csm (player elected representatives) and ccp (the developer). plex for remap has been discussed to hell and back on numerous threads on the forum.there's no need to discuss it any further - we're done with it. if you wanted to support plex for remap, you should have posted in the discussion threads that were active for months, especially in the assembly hall section of the forum. i believe csm and ccp have read most of the constructive arguments for and against this feature and decided what's the best for the game."
11/22/2010,"yea perhaps so. but that's another thing that just bugs me, i don't really need to go on the forums to participate i just want to play! but then again i know if it's good for the game it's good for the rest of us, i'm left to wonder if atleast someone had a say of backing it lol. sacrificing a few days just for that ain't seem so much anyhow- i hope to see everything for everyone like that one dude said: let's just wait to see. i don't know how csm or the body representatives do stuff and all but i know they are also players anyone can relate to asides from the vet to- newbs difference."
11/22/2010,nice event. its good to be able to directly ask the csm some questions. nice job moderating dv.
11/22/2010,"i was unable to make this, but the effort by the csm is appreciated. it is, however disheartening to see this thread got a whole 2 pages of replies while incessant whine threads get tens of pages of replies. -reading the transcript now. thanks again."
11/22/2010,it makes me sob sometimes :(
11/22/2010,"thanks for taking the lead on this round table, dierdra. you did a great job on all of it! sorry i could only be present for part of it, the wiki transcript was a good read and that is a nice editing job...again, thanks!"
11/22/2010,great idea and thanks for the effort!its a pitty that helen highwater and alpha were not in attendance this would have been a great oppurtunity for the community to see them in action and to meet them in person.
11/22/2010,"i confirm that my favourite solo pvp playgrounds are broken (serpentis one as i understand it from a context of a post). also the bloodraiders deadspace last pocket could be changed to the structure instead of that red cont bots just loot with no risk, and as for the keys between the rooms, bloodraiders is a good example how to do it - just kill all npc there. mix those 2 good solutions and you will make solo pvpers and duel lovers happy. i did submitted a bugreport about it, and i hope they will be fixed. and if you will take this suggestions into the consideration, it could be even better."
11/22/2010,"i've had them respawn. i was able to do the same complex twice in one day because of the respawn. however, that was in high sec, and things might be different elsewhere."
11/22/2010,"if we are going to discuss impossibilities i propose we roll back to red moon rising, since i kinda missed it and there is that fun flash video about it. but let's take the idea a step further:what if, bear with me, we could have singularity rolled to different versions of the game. like have tyranis week, and revelations fridays. it would be like time travel, but with game versions. you could go back to before there were even more than 20 ships, or play with that badass looking alpha ui we see sometimes!think of the unreachable possibilities!"
11/22/2010,"spend about 75% of your presentation time justifying your own existence...oh wait, that's what you did last fanfest."
11/22/2010,"there are some pretty healthy threads around about blasters and railguns needing attention but i read a post in one that outlined the weapons systems -- outside of ships and it made me think a bit more about the topic.most comparisons deal with different weapons as they are fitted on various hulls - as in comparing an amarr battleship fitting lasers to gallente with hybrids. when you pull the weapons off the ships and compare them, the weapons themselves aren't that far off but when fitted to appropriate ships... the ship stats and bonuses make the hybrids look fairly lame.rockets needed fixing vs just the ships but i think all the fixing could be handled at the ship bonus level for hybrid guns. not just gallente ships but the caldari gunships need it too. i think i'd also prefer the devs to take a good look at the ships with respect to balancing them out a bit better -- if they are tweaking around bonuses, they might be able to look at the other stats of the ships and perhaps bring gallente ships more in line with some of their counterparts from other races."
11/23/2010,"what about addressing the portal range issue by providing a t2 and named variants of the portal generator?as a fan of the dominix, i would like to be able to transfer my drone skills to the sin, and would happily give up the hybrids bonus and all the turret hard points for some more drone dps/repping.slightly larger fuel bays, combined with slightly better bridging fuel efficiency and range due to named/t2 bridge generators, will address most of the issues people have with black ops. i would not want to see them buffed to the point of being capable frontline combatants, so if they become powerful enough to replace t1 ships when running missions you know something is wrong.there should be some sacrifice for the ability to bridge in a sub-cap hull. in return the bridge should have utility that can be expanded with some expense.buff range by 5% to 50% based on some modules, reduce fuel consumption by a similar amount on others, have the pilot choose between higher range or better efficiency."
11/23/2010,"the problem with drones is that they dont apply damage on the target immedelately, so this should be fixed aswell, ether buff drone damage or drone vellocity bonus"
11/23/2010,keeping hope alive.change the cloaked velocity bonus to a 20% per level reduction of scan resolution and speed penalty of fitting cloaking devices.increase jump and bridge range by 50% (should be enough to get some of those regional jumps that are just out of reach currently) change the sin's agility bonus to a 7.5% tracking bonus per level.change the panther's speed bonus to 10% falloff per level bonus. add t2 resists.
11/23/2010,still... u ghost?
11/23/2010,"noabsolutely not. micro transactions are for trash games which cannot hold its own subscribers, so they are forced to be ""free"" and finance from micro transactions.however, micro-transactions severely move economic power differences from real life to game world. and that is not something that will allow fair play and equal terms for everyone."
11/23/2010,"can someone please explain to me in a substantial post as to why plex for remap is so terrible?-plex for remap doesn't make you better than other players. as long as implants and learning skills are the same your max sp/hr is no faster than any other players. i think too many people likens plex for remap with plex for sp. i do agree that plex for sp would be really, really bad. however, its plex for remap and not sp.-plex for remap allows players who don't want to commit a full year to a specific training path. lets admit it, to someone who is only a couple months old at eve, a full year feels like an eternity and that massive amount of time can be intimidating and may contribute to a lot of newer players quitting eve.also, lets leave the slippery slope fallacies out of this (plex for remap? whats next? <--- slippery slope fallacy) and whining about ccp's profit margins. they're a buisness. their goal is to make money. deal with it."

11/23/2010,"not supported.don't they cost substantially more than any other frig out there? market equalizes all things. if a curse can kill a dram and cost less, then the dram is balanced in the context of the game as a whole. the other frigs just need boosting to match."
11/23/2010,"no dram pilot in their right minds would be caught within web range of a daredevil. also, when one ship can only be countered by a single, expensive ship in its own ship class, there's still a problem.personally, i say take out the drone bay or drop a mid."
11/23/2010,the future of mining is in my opinion that most of the rocks spawn in anomalies but what to do with the belts we already have i mean they are one of the main pvp areas in low secmy answer? well we still got planets also pvp will just shift towards the anomalies while reading the op i got the idea of to some extend merge radar ladar and mag sites so you can find some abandoned ship wrecks or some hidden hacking can between your roids also having some gas clouds around in these sites is a great idea and why not extend gas mining to be able to collecting the left over dust clouds of a gneiss roid?
11/23/2010,"yes, please."
11/23/2010,"well got to agree with you there i am gallente also went all the way up specializing in t2 425mm hybrids, which are fine against low end missions then took my megathron into mini space got into mission with angels in the angels extravaganza and well got popped, when i found i did crap dps due to only having em + therm ammo i quickly revisited the research books again, and went into caldari ships as missles have ammo types for all situations and have been there ever since, but i would like to get back to using my hybrids that i trained for so long to use and felt horribly let down by their limitations vs other weapons so yep please fix them."
11/23/2010,"agreed, eve needs more shiny things :)"
11/23/2010,i very much like this idea.
11/23/2010,great idea! +1
11/23/2010,"good idea, i was thinking the other day that some sort of ""picture-in-picture"" for targets would be cool :)"
11/23/2010,"well, if freespace 2 had it, why not eve?make a bounding box(invisible) around the targeted ship, stick a camera on the left side of the box, show what camera shows."
11/23/2010,"nice idea, i like it.but should definately be optional for performance reasons.hate me for saying it, but as far as i recall, even wow had some addon that replaced the static portraits with animated, rendered 3d-portraits (for player and target/target's target)."

11/23/2010,"you saw what has to be done to a caracal to fit lse+mwd+t2 hams. you and i both agree it is a bad fit. that with max fitting skills.a moa, with max fitting skills, has to use 2 rcu to fit t2 neutrons+lse+mwd and nothing else. that is a bad fit. using high meta, and max fitting skills, you still have to fit an rcu.rupture can do 425mm+lse+mwd, but you are talking about a 4 weapon setup (no missiles?) as compared to the 5 weapon setups of non-minmatar ships. stabber and belicose are more of the same.vexor can fit heavy tank and mwd because no one worries about dps from the guns, so they stick some piddly guns on and rely on drones for dps. otherwise, you can't even fit a full rack of neutrons and a mwd without running into a grid wall.thorax, with max skills, runs up with the grid wall just putting a rack of neutrons on it. the only reason no one complains is because they don't put the high end guns on a thorax and accept that they will have to fit grid module(s).all the cruisers are tight fits if you stick an mwd and a full rack of t2 weapons on them."
11/23/2010,"you can fit a full rack of tech 2 medium weapons and mwd on a rupture, moa and thorax without fitting mods. same with the stabber, caracal has problems but alara mentioned the assault fit only for his example of fitting t2 weapons on it."
11/23/2010,"i didn't say it wasn't possible. hybrid cruisers go with the smallest medium blasters already. minmatar can stick the big acs on. the omen can easily be fit with t2 focused medium pulse though. if the argument is that minmatar cruisers can fit heavier weapons than the other races' cruisers, the flaw in that is that minmatar are simply fitting 1-2 less guns to accomplish this."
11/23/2010,"been mulling over this one for a while. might as well put it out there.basically, divide each plex by 30. sell 24 hour plex on the website for the price of 50 cents a piece. maybe give minor discounts for buying large amounts or something. list the average market price of plex on the ""buy plex"" webpage.plex becomes a lower-end trade commodity, people get to ""buy"" isk in increments smaller than 760 million (since i'm pretty sure you can only buy plex by the pair), ccp gets praised for having an inovative new business model and still turns a profit, and the economy gets more interesting for everybody.everybody wins, nobody gets hurt.the only real ""issue"" would be that people could remove trial account restrictions a little too easily, but i'm sure that could be worked around.bonus sub-proposal: plex for pizza becomes easier to implement!"
11/23/2010,"sure, we need smaller units than 15 dollars for microtransactions, and them based on a time unit makes some sort of sense."
11/23/2010,signed bumped and delivered.

11/23/2010,"supported out of common sense. i still maintain that ""24 hour plex"" would be a good idea if you're going to introduce microtransactions, by the way."
11/23/2010,"hull  orcapurpose  tower tear downdescription  the aptly named squid is o.r.es solution to the ever growing population of abandoned towers whose system codes block the deployment of new towers while being more than a speck in the background doing nothing. while the standard solution for tower removal has been a blas<U+FFFD> of gunfire and torpedo launchs it is both a waste of ammunition, time, and a good still usable pos structure. to this end o.r.e developed a special array system that allows for the hacking of offline pos towers and there recovery.the use of this ship requires a module known as a recovery array in order to use this module the squid must be within 250m of the tower and is locked in place while active, unlike siege modules you may cancel the activation at any time restoring ship mobility but you must complete the full cycle to get the tower. the squid itself can carry up to 4 raw towers which are restored to normal status once they are placed in a station/pos hanger.the recovery array is a complex set of large robotic arms with various tools to break through and into a towers hull to access the tasty goodness inside. it has 2 effects depending on if the tower is currently active or offline.note: both the ship and the module require a skill to use both reduce the time required to hack a tower up to a total of 50% with both at level 5when recovering an active tower i.e. one that is still online but its shields are down it takes 4 hours, every additional squid that works on the tower reduces the time by 20 minutes with the tower going to the squid that started first.when recovering a offline tower its internal defences are low on power and even lower the longer it remains offline , starting at 4 hours, every day the tower remains offline reduces the time for recovery by 5 minutes ( with more squids reducing time as above) it will always take at least 15 minutes to recover a tower.additionally after 2 weeks of inactivity concord no longer considers it a hostile act to recover a tower in high sec as by that time the emergency supplies for the towers crew will be running out.why this would be of benefit- removal and reuse of the plague of offline towers that some people simple dont care enough to reclaim on their own- due to towers can now be taken some of the people with the offlines may recover them- no real way to abuse the system, any potential target of the squid was going to be dealt with by gun fire anyways and would have been destroyed."
11/23/2010,id rather see the story behind it that the code of the tower gets hacked and it then goes over into your hands and then can get unanchored but w/ea ship like that is needed imho the orca is not too big nor too small as a hull the prices of towers won't really feel it as the price will go down by 200% with incursion anyway so...i see nothing against such a shipedit: must have somehow missed it : supported with the caveat of no effect on online tower
11/23/2010,i personally quite like this sort of idea gives a new orca variant that can be used just about anywhere especially within wh's to remove some of them pesky towers that seem to be abandoned.
11/23/2010,i don't like the idea that it can be used on an online tower with no shields.so...quick way to bash down a pos - punch through the shields and then set up five squids next to it. boom - suddenly pos armor becomes meaningless.
11/23/2010,"sorry i ment for that to include armor as well, basicaly once you get the pos to stucture you could take it"
11/23/2010,"you've got the same problem though. an entire layer of defense is suddenly rendered useless, so why have it at all? let's not forget, pos's are not ships - they have substantial amounts of structure (8,000,000 hit points for a non faction large tower, by example). the idea that you can completely bypass that doesn't sit well with me.limit it to solely offline towers (i.e. towers that have run out of fuel and shut themselves down) and i'd tentatively support the idea of hacking them to take them down, if not your exact implementation."
11/23/2010,supported with the caveat of no effect on online towers.
11/23/2010,"im not seeing the problem here, if you have managed to break a tower donw to only its hull left the towers dead in 20 minutes anyways why not have the ability to bring in a ship to take it, a single squid with full skills will still take 2 hours to crack the tower and if they bring 8 squids 15 minutes minimum. still seeing that i might not see the issue maybe a compromiseafter you bash down the towers hull it enters a second hull state ( sort of like a secondary reinfore like outposts have) that lasts for 1 minute breaking any locks. at this state the tower has 25000 hp ( less than a cruser) with no reistances what so ever , at this time you may attempt to take the pos or fire one more round and finish the job."
11/23/2010,i guess no support or what?nobody wants to pull his favorite station hugger closer?
11/23/2010,"i'll support.because it would least keep kiting tacklers on their toes. u know, the ones that stay a completely safe distance but still within max warp jam range til their blob comes."
11/23/2010,"yeah, why not."
11/23/2010,+1 yes i want it asap!!!!
11/23/2010,"any ship traveling under a certain speed that has a lower mass than the other ship without any web or anything will then be completely unable to escape?also, wouldn't it break aligning? unless you propose stuff being towed sideways, which would effectively stop speed from helping you escape.but i'll give you a thumbs up since it'd be pretty damn hilarious."
11/23/2010,"would suggest the creation of tug , modules that would allow smaller ships to act like they are bigger, we currenty have small tugboats that can push giant freightersother wise yyes"
11/23/2010,one thing i'd like to see is this as an alternative to hauling smaller ships by cargo hold
11/23/2010,"i support this as long as the tractor velocity is a debuff and not the same way as a webifier. so a fast ship pulling directly away from the tractoring ship is only slowed down by 500 m/s. but if the ship is orbiting, the orbiter would have to compensate. larger ships should be able to affect smaller ships more than a smaller ship can affect a larger one."
11/23/2010,cool idea. time to train up the battle rorqual!
11/23/2010,while we're at it let's make salvagers do structure damage to minmatar ships
11/23/2010,"i can't believe i'm saying this, but i would support this (with some tweaking of the % and implants)."
11/23/2010,"supported in principle.alternate proposal:1) ""learning"", the skill, remains unchanged: it stays at a 2% bonus per level and remains a rank 1 skill.2) the other 10 skills in the learning category are removed and any skillpoints invested are reimbursed.3) a new skill called ""self improvement"" is introduced (the name of the skill is tentative; what we call it is unimportant).self improvement (x1)soct advanced mental training. while this training obviously is of great value to anyone, the most impressive results are achieved by students with great latent potential. training in this skill allows a student to develop almost superhuman mental qualities.2 point bonus to all attributes per skill level.the overall effect on skilltraining is thus almost unchanged while still reducing the number of ranks in the learning category from 21 to 2. i note that anubis xian's original proposal also reduces the number of ranks in the learning category from 21 to 2. this alternate proposal should address concerns that anubis xian's original proposal is a highsec buff or nullsec nerf because of the effect of implants."
11/23/2010,anything that gets rid of the current system...
11/23/2010,that does sound like a better solution. keeping the dynamic the same seems to be the critical issue.
11/23/2010,nice.
11/23/2010,"here's my only contention; doesn't it seem a little overpowered to have a total of ten attribute points allocated for training a skill that's only a 1x multiplier? i say make it at least a 4x. there might be an objection here since one of the main issues people raise with the learning skills is that they take time, but here's my thought. making it a 4x multiplier makes leveling to iv not convenient, per se, but certainly doable, and level v a good chunk of time sacrificed for the advantages gained. this is more appropriate, i feel, since 1. with a single skill as powerful as this, it should take some time to max it out, 2. it is still considerably less time than training all the learning skills currently in existence, and 3. only those who really wanted it would have maxed skills. i understand leveling the playing field, but time-intensive skills exist for a reason: the game would be a lot less fun if everyone could specialize in everything, and likewise i think something as important as the most advanced level of a learning skill should be reserved for those who work for it.thoughts?edit: forgot to support topic"
11/23/2010,"made this idea up in another thread liked it so much that i refined it and made it into its own post , so without further a due the bio ship.unlike normal ships bio ships are not built, they are grown. a bio ship consumes both food (bio pastes and such) and knowledge (skill points). this means that you cannot actively train a skill and grow a bio ship at the same time. when you start of you get an egg after caring for it for about a day you have a basic ship thats more of a frigate sized shuttle than anything else. this is where the customization of the bio ship comes into play. every aspect of the ship is based on what you teach it to grow into. you can teach it to grow big and strong reaching through the size categories all the way up to titan status (take a heck of a long time) or what its body structure is like. as an example i could train my ship to better resist em damage by 5% with about 4 hours work, i could then add another 5% ( stacking) with that time * 1.5, so 6 hours , with it maxing out at 95% .i could get my ship to grow its first mid slot (referred to as a node) of which i would then get it to grow a bio shield hardener that acts much like the current devices do. with the growth of its first high slot it gains a visible node on the hull of the ship that any weapons node you grow in a high slot fires out of ( to make it easier to actually build a ship model) this means that 3-4 turrets will appear to fire from the same spot.with this system the possibilities are numerous, but there are restrictions. first and foremost its your pet and it wont listen to anyone else so you cant swap/trade it. second as the many banks view a bio ship as a pet they are not covered under any form of warranty/insurance. lastly to get a bio ship up to the point of being better than its class of ship (i.e. a bio battle ship can be a lot better than a normal one) takes a serious investment of skill points and once blown up is irrecoverable. the loss of a bs sized bioship could set a player back a half year or more in skill points."
11/23/2010,so you want eve tamagachi
11/23/2010,i like the idea of a fully customizable ship but i would make it use new skills that need to be trained higher if you want to further improve the shipsay bioship 1 gives you te ability to build a bioship about the size of a frigthen you can train bio offensive systems giving you the abilety to make guns/launchers on the shipif you lose the ship you lose some of the skills in line with t3 ships perhaps more the bigger the ship isyou can also train the skills before you start building the ship then your skills will make the ship grow faster depending on the skills

11/23/2010,"basically what you're asking for is null sec that can't be attacked by capital ships, but you can build capital ships in it, thus making an impenetrable fortress. even if a current large 0.0 alliance didn't find it first, whoever was able to secure such a space would end up becoming a major force simply because they would have fairly safe null sec space.i like the idea of building out gates to connect different systems in quasi-k-space regions though."
11/23/2010,"sounds like w-space, but with sov, stations, gates and a market. oh and the first alliance to colonize gets supercap advantage forever.no thanks. w-space is great as is, (delayed local, no supercaps, no lag, no blobs) and if you don't like scanning, htfu."
11/23/2010,"although the op mentions null-sec exclusively, i would like to see this expanded to an entire region (or two) that includes all security space.ensure that in each large blob of k-space there are unique resources and materials, and then you end up with an economy that needs to go through wormhole space in order to run. this makes w-space more interesting in general and will increase traffic.by making the space not exclusively null-sec, and including some low and high sec, you create a way for established power blocks to become challenged since there is a safer staging area for an attacker.as an additional means of moving between these regions, perhaps there can be a new class of ship that is designed to use really far jump gates, and consumes some kind of fuel to do so. something that can't carry a whole lot of cargo (100s of m3). this will allow people to move between these regions, but at a (potentially high) cost.side note: i wish people would work with and modify and idea into something better instead of an outright ""omg no u nub""."

11/23/2010,"hear, hear!"
11/23/2010,there are more cases of that with other skills that also need to get fixed
11/23/2010,a minor fix but good.same thing needs to happen with the ewar drone skill.
11/23/2010,a lot of skill books need their text redone. might as well start here.
11/23/2010,i've also found confusing skillbook text irritating.
11/23/2010,warp speeds are generally not all that differentiating. i say we make systems 10x larger or so. to make warp speed much more important. at the same time... fix those 500au systems by leaving them the same size.this will mean that interceptors will be able to actually catch stuff because systems are large enough for it to matter.this will increase the time logistics take relative to freighter warp time.
11/23/2010,i agree with the idea in general but have you ever flown a freighter? i mean (100/0.75)/60=2.2 so it takes two whole minutes for one to cros a system with 100 au now think about a 500au system? and then thing about having to cross 20 such systems ((500/0.75)/60)x20=yep you would spend entire three hours in warp now thats fun isn't it?the real problem is not that the systems are too small rather than that all ships speed up at the same speed in warp ceptors and freighters alike if that would change or we even would get instant speed up like startreck etc then things would be a lot better and ceptors would get much more out of their high warp speed
11/23/2010,"doesn't this seem like an entirely backwards solution to the problem you present?space is quite large. it is unimaginable how long it would take to cross the average system in eve at sub-warp speeds. rather than increase the size of every single one of the 7500+ systems new eden has, why not simply tweak warp speeds to achieve exactly the same effect?in particular, the acceleration rates of ships warping.increase the rate at which the faster warping ships reach that faster warping speed, and perhaps slow the acceleration of the slower warping ships, and now you would find those ships have an easier time catching up.i agree with you though, that there is a problem."
11/23/2010,"in reference to all ships with a ship maintenance bay, when destroyed (currently) their contents simply vanish from game. this is inconsistent with the way pos module smas work. (they pop and everything comes out like a pinata, it's really neat) it also makes for silly killboard denial games.i propose that the contents a) either pop out always, b) pop out sometimes, and / or c) show up as having in the contents of the hold on the killmail, just like drones in the dronebay do.if you vote for the proposal, please indicate your preference."
11/23/2010,i want option a.(supporting my own proposal)

11/23/2010,"pretty simple, not sure if this has been proposed at all before; but as a lazy merchant, i'd really appreciate having the ability to quickly sort through my personal assets by sec status and jumps, to work out what ship i'm going to use and which route i'm going to take to pick stuff up in.also another minor thing that i was unable to add to the subject line, is the question of cancelling a set destination. to my knowledge the only way to do that is to load the map options, which involves atleast opening the system map, and at worst (if you're unlucky) opening the starmap. moving the waypoints menu to a different place, making a new option in the right click menu on your ship(or anything) to remove the current set destination, or making it so that you didn't have to load a map automatically when you clicked the map options could all potentially work. i dunno, if there's a simpler way of cancelling a destination or waypoint that's eluded me then please tell me. it just seems too long winded to really be the only way."

11/24/2010,"firstly, a little note: ""number 105: make more faction items tradable on market (csm) ""is already going to be implemented, as seen here: incursion feature page (second from bottom), though that one does not include faction modules, but rather, faction ships.and 45 and 142 are pretty much the same thing, just 45 is more specific, and 142 is more general. i'll add 142 to my list, but 45 is just as important and i think they should be combined.lots of good ideas though, i have a lot of favorites because of that._____________________________________________singoth, 15, 50, 83 (must!!!), 85, 92, 109, 117, 129, 142, 156, 163, 202"

11/24/2010,"first off it can not fit focused without heavily diminishing tank and even with this buff it would still need to use adaptive plating. it will not overpower the the ship in the least but let it be fit as effectivly as the others. with the prescibed buff it won't even be able to fit heavies, just a small usable tank and focused pulse as well as be more friendly to newer players.as for the rupture you are overlooking 3 things.*those 4 guns get a double dmg bonus covering the loss of one gun giving it an effective 6 of the largest ac's*it still has room for two energy nuetralizers and double the drone bay.*the omen's second bonus is to weapons cap while ac's are cap free and it uses nuets.as for the stabber it's second bonus goes to a kiting tank and it fits the big guns as well.the moa is usually fit with ions not wasting a mag stab slot getting 400 dps with a 30000ehp tankthe vexor can jam a 1600mm plate and deal over 200 drone dps and a 800mm with between 400 and 500 dps.the thorax is ok but fitting should allow ions in my opinion and the caracal i would love to see a good brawler fit available.in all they all have effective fits and even though i am not happy with the overall standards of the cruiser line up this buff will in no way overpower such a rarely used ship. all i am asking is a small and well agreed apon fitting buff so it doesn't slip through the cracks and will see mainstream use again.so please give your support for such a cool ship and breeth just a bit of life into it."
11/24/2010,"there are a whole load of ships that need rebalancing, such as the enyo, caracal, vexor, thorax, moa, brutix, omen etc."
11/24/2010,"the argument is that the omen and caracal cant fit cruiser weapons, tank and mwd unlike the other major cruisers in each race.edit. bomberlocks what wrong with the vexor, i can see the thorax due to hybrids being crap but the vexor is good"
11/24/2010,no. no problem running desired fits.
11/24/2010,+1trial account restrictions solution: you can only subscribe to a full account by purchasing a full month of game time.expired accounts problems: active skill continues to train ~3 days after your game time expired. introducing 24h plexes would cut down 
11/24/2010,i likes.
11/24/2010,"thisedit: support, dur!"
11/24/2010,approved
11/24/2010,approved.
11/24/2010,yes.
11/24/2010,"the only issue i can see with this is that ccp will get charged for each transaction by the banks. other than that, this seems like a sensible and logical idea. if we're to have micro-transactions, they might was well be efficiently and conveniently implemented."
11/24/2010,"i support this proposal. in the advanced tutorial, when you get the destroyer (coercer) ... i did the mission... couldn't even fit a full complement of t1 medium lasers (small)... an ab, tried to mod for armor tanking.i almost lost it.i did it again in a punisher, i was afraid to, an anti-frigate destroyer almost lost, what chance would i have in a frigate? it was like night and day. it's sad when something in it's description states that it is an anti-frigate platform... yet loose to 1 frigate!i didn't even know about the ""glass cannon"" train of thought.... but even then, that fails... the coercer is a glass pellet gun!"
11/24/2010,"i love my gank catalyst on frigate roams, but to be out dps'd and out ranged by dramiels, daredevils, and some t1 frigs is just, well, pathetic. glass certainly, but a cannon it is not.c'mon ccp, give destroyers some love.coercer for example has only one mid. you get a ab/mwd or tackle, not both.cormorant only has one low, so it's tank (yeah right) or magstab, not bot. i would like to see this turned into a rocket boat.catalyst and thrasher have good slot layouts, but i would have to agree that the catalyst would be much more useful with a damage bonus instead of the falloff bonus. considering the pathetic dps of small rails, the couple hundred meters you get from the falloff bonus is useless when using blasters."
11/24/2010,"by the way, aging is already implemented in using mining crystals. its just a logical extension to more items and can be greatly balanced out by numbers.this way it wouldnt ruin the game at all, its completly in the hands of the developers to do this right.only problem is you have to trust them, so they dont mess it up completly.it also can be fixed during every downtime, if something is going wrong.and yes, why dont people become older ingame ?you can always jump into a new younger clone."
11/24/2010,im not sure about this one. cause technically our characters are just clones we're bio-creations and were in a sense created to be. +1 anyway
11/24/2010,"it is not ageing. it is usage wear. in game mining crystals and laser crystals are ammunitions and are consumed. they use a slightly different mechanics from other ammunitions but the end reasoning is the same, you use your ammunitions to get a result and doing that you consume them.note that you can use stripminers without crystals and they will never wear out."
11/24/2010,"no, if i wanted to play reality i'd look out the window. it would simply create meaningless money and time sink."
11/24/2010,"well, this is a simulation. i think its a good way to make it as realistic as possible. it should be logic and somehow ""right"", still its fiction and of course most mechanics of eve are completly unrealistic.one of my friends would like to add something to this idea:they should be a different racial bonus to aging or wearing, however you want to call this. amarr ships for example are slow, so they have a bonus on aging. minmatar ships, because they are fast and fragile will age a bit faster. obviously their construction is not that sturdy as other races are. the other races are just in between. some will be easier to repair, others more difficult, so aging can be controlled by high level mechanic skills or specialized stations, like the amarr stations, where you have bonus on building ships can probably help an old ship with doint some ""restauration""... just some ideas how this feature can be implented in many different ways."
11/24/2010,"think of the planes and boats we use today on earth. most of them have very long services lives. here in canada (laugh it up) we have a fleet of cf-18s from 1980. theses are 30 year old fighter planes that are just being replaced through the next 10 years. i'd assume that our ships and equipment in eve, receives the same maintenance and care our earthly cf-18s received, or even more. this maintenance and care is abstracted for good reason.1) the economic difference between the interstellar credit, and planetary monies (this maintenance would only cost fractions of an isk)2) this micro management would simply not be fun for the player. i don't want to return to an account that has been inactive for over 200 days (which i just have) and have to spend a bunch of time and isk repairing all my ships."
11/24/2010,no.
11/24/2010,supported - more fw love please
11/24/2010,"supported.i honestly don't think it would take that much dev time to fix the current situation. having spent several months in fw and throughly enjoying it, i'm not really sure how to make it better. though i agree it could use a lot more love."
11/24/2010,"while i'm or less happy with fw as it is (i don't plex and system occupancy doesn't interest me), mainly because i see fw as the easiest way to get constant targets and easy to find fights, there is a lot of room for improvement. - system sov should be awarded on a kill/death ratio not by plexing.- system sov should give the sov holder an lp bonus.- fw kills should give good lp, based on target value and should replace fw missions as the main way to earn lp. that will help in removing an isk faucet in game."
11/24/2010,"noah hates fw, he didn't want it released and doesn't want any work done on it now it is.one personally opinion is ruining gaming experience for a not insignificant portion of players.we enjoy fw. we like it. it's our part of the game.eve is a sandbox game not this ""0.0 is the endgame"" garbage."
11/24/2010,"no. i didn't do a lot of fw. but i would like to see this expansion deployed, fixes for fw fixes can come after january."
11/24/2010,1
11/24/2010,"currently pilots can produce tech ii modules with the input of tech i modules. however in some cases the new created total volume gets much smaller. let me give you a few examples:strip miner i + deep core mining laser i  volume 100m3 + volume 5m3 >> modulated strip miner ii  volume 5m3ice harvester i  volume 100m3 > ice harvester ii  volume 5m3strip miner i + deep core mining laser i  volume 100m3 + volume 5m3 >> modulated deep core strip miner ii  volume 5m3in these examples the volumes go from 105m3 to 5m3 or 100m3 to 5m3, which do not make a lot sense for the producer is adding stuff together.this is a minor issue which can easily be adjusted; however it is an important difference for haulers and markets that do work with them."
11/24/2010,the volume of the t1 items got increased so it wont be so easy to haul them into nullsec to get minerals out there.
11/24/2010,so there's a skill called tactical shield manipulation who per level drops chance of damage leaking through shields to armor. if you regularly passive shield tank for pvp this skill is absolutely nutty to train to level 5. because when your ship is say around 15%-20% shields it's actually better to have a small bit of damage leaking through the shields as this leaves shields higher and regenerates more shields better. i suggest the ability for the pilot in that situation collapse shields for a second. the shields still regenerate like they would as if there was nobody shooting you.similarly for armor tankers you might decide to collapse shields from the beginning when you still have say 75% shields left. then when your armor hits 0% you turn shields back on it regened to 100% during fight and it gives a bit buffer just for a cycle or 2 of your repper.
11/24/2010,"this is, i believe, an awesome suggestion. would add a bit more strategy to tanking.supported."
11/24/2010,supported.
11/24/2010,would like to see an in-game effect to this too.
11/24/2010,the ability to turn off your shields temporarily...... i like it.
11/24/2010,"when i created this thread i was unaware at the time that there were other pos threads. ah well, just more of a chance to get the poss fixed. sign this"
11/24/2010,incarna? in/at a pos? that would give alot of controll would it not?
11/24/2010,in favor of new orca variant either way.
11/24/2010,"games whit microtransactions dont have subscriptions plansif ccp wants items shop in eve should remove all subscription plans, any kind of microtransaction should automatically remove the subscription feemicrotransactions or subscription but not both on the same time few example this games have microtransactions but this games dont have a subscription feeatlantica onlineddovindictus world of tanks allodsglobal agenda"
11/24/2010,i think not.reason: huge profit drop for ccp entirely.
11/24/2010,over my cancelled subscriptions.
11/24/2010,and if you like player dont accept microtransactions and subscription on the same time and cancel your accounts there wont be any profits just sayingread again if microtransactions get in eve remove subscription plans
11/24/2010,"it not complex subscription is stable funding, micro-transactions are not.besides those u mentioned games have alot of issues i rather not seem them re-accumulate onto eve."
11/24/2010,"you misinterpret my meaning. if ccp goes to an f2p model with microtransactions for everything in sight, i will cancel my subscriptions and go play something else.you want mt's for vanity items? fine. because then i don't have to pay to keep up. but if you dump subscriptions altogether how long do you think it will before you're using microtransactions for everything else (like skill books - wanna fly a battleship? that'll be $1.50 please.)"
11/24/2010,"world of warcraft has both subscription fees and microtransactions. how does that fit with your idea of how an mmo is ""supposed"" to work?"
11/24/2010,eve already has a free to play option. was there anything else you wanted?
11/24/2010,by subscription plans you mean like plex?
11/24/2010,"if eve changed to micro transactions i would quit immediately. i hate being nickled and dimed, i want to pay my monthly fee and enjoy all that the game has to offer."
11/24/2010,"this game has both, sub, and plex, the only difference between this and other mmo's with microtransactions, is that so far, eve only has 1 thing, as long as it doesn't bring in,buy 1mil sp for $20, then it will be fine, cosmetic things are ok as well. remaps are ok but it would be better to be an npc service that is exponential o provide an isk sink."
11/24/2010,"in theory i like the idea of having just a couple of modes for simplicity's sake, but it would pretty heavily reduce the usefulness of hybrids being modular.your second suggestion is much more useful, but it can be simplified. since 3 sliders seem like a reasonable number of options for sliders, i'll go with that as well. the sliders can easily fit in the current overview as module slots without actually being modules, of course. for ease of use, one slider can fit into one module slot, and be differentiated from the other sliders with different colors maybe.first slider could just be damage output. --forget about toggling between high alpha vs high rate of fire. just have the option to increase dmg at the cost of more cap, so no change in rof. much simpler.second slider is just for range. --increase range by increasing cap usage.third slider is just for tracking. --same deal. increase tracking by increasing cap usage.this format would allow for each player to decide how they want to reduce cap if need be while still giving plenty of options that make sense for a variety of situations."
11/24/2010,"the pirate population is almost completely destroyed.caldari pvp has been horrible for far too long.the csm have failed to adequately address these problems.*snip* please mind the language. spitfireit's basically a method for care bears to get their way.the player-base should be represented by independent lobbies based on profession not on the gallente style democratic election. anyone who is democratically elected is bound to be an incompetent idiot.for the first two reasons ccp needs to be kicked in the balls. the csm can't do this it has failed big ass time.___________________________________________________________added 25/11/2010i don't have all the time in the world to reply to your idiotic comments one by one so i'm just going to make a blanket statement. i don't care about what initiatives have been put in place to do things... this is just a repeat of past initiatives that were supposed to do the same thing. the csm has failed to institute any measures to fix anything in the game. the game used to be good and the game design has progressively become worse and worse due to emo whinging on the forums by carebears. the csm has done nothing to stop the steady decline in the quality of eve it only serves as a mechanism to confuse the stupid who are in the majority that changes to the game are being implemented. this is exactly what is happening with the rocket 'fix'. i don't want to go into how the changes to rockets don't affect caldari ships to make them viable at pvp. what my proposal is is that we get rid of this forum where stupid people put their stupid ideas forward and influence the game to make it more stupid. ccp obviously don't play their fricken game, if they did they'd fix it. they obviously don't because it's been broken basically forever.- piracy is dead. there used to be piracy in eve.- a lot of caldari mechanics are broken and have been broken for a long time.- generally pvp shield tanking is broken. (t1 battleships specifically)- caldari weapon systems are broken in pvp.- some caldari ships were designed to fit webs/cap rechargers and have had their mid slots removed making them nonviable pvp platforms and in one case pve.- pvp is moving towards being completely consensual i.e. you have to sign up for faction warfare + there are a whole lot of dialogue boxes popping up warning you if you're going to perform an illegal act. additionally you can abandon wrecks to prevent flashy red people popping up around you. this was actually supported by the csm.- faction warfare introduced basically another anti-piracy policy in eve by introducing massive organization in low-sec that is something in the order of up to 6000 players to effectively prey on pirates. so they've introduced a predator.the csm has achieved nothing dissolve it. the only surprise i expect to receive in upcoming expansions is 'surprise eve just got worse'. they haven't achieved anything regarding real money items in eve online. dissolve the csm.removed trolling remarks. zymurgist"
11/24/2010,"signedalso, the player-base should be represented by ccp playing their ****ing game."
11/24/2010,"and i think that the majority of players should feel free to direct the game as they please by electing those who represent their interests, as opposed to leveling the playing field and giving an apparent fringe equal say with the mainstream. that said, tears are delicious. if you dislike the current csm structure, maybe next election cycle more people in your profession should actually vote."
11/24/2010,if piracy sucks there will be less pirates and therefore less votes to count towards pirate candidates. you sir are a good demonstration of why the csm has failed and will continue to fail.thank you for the demonstration.trolling remark removed. zymurgist
11/24/2010,"but if most people dont like being pirates, then why should there be a push to satisfy this fringe minority?and if most people don't want to support the interests of this unpopular minority, then why should their interests be a priority?not supported due to nonsense."
11/24/2010,"in that case the player-base doesn't exist, and i don't grasp why you think it should be equally represented. i also don't accept that there is such a huge demographic discrepancy merely on your say-so.oh good. when all else fails, do result to playground insults, it truly drives your point home. certainly. please continue with your elaboration. i'm dying to hear why a player-elected body should represent a career path that isn't mainstream in the player-base, or be dissolved for failing to follow the wishes of the majority of the electorate."
11/24/2010,notsureifserious.jpg
11/24/2010,i'm gonna bite and just point out real quick that the chair of the csm is a pirate.
11/24/2010,"i tried running on a pro-pirate platform, but was disqualified because i account shared in the past. the guy who dq'd me said that if i kept my nose clean, i'd be allowed to run again next time.maybe i'll give it another whack."
11/24/2010,i'd vote for ya. at least you're an honest crook.
11/24/2010,1: pirate population destroyed? bull****.2: caldari pvp horrible? fly a drake or get a falcon. how about coming up with a solution and not just crying tears?3: ccp is the problem... not the csm.this is nothing more than a troll thread and a whine fest.seriously... waste of time.
11/24/2010,i think all decisions should be public poll upon logging in tbh
11/24/2010,not supported due to op apparently being an arrogant prick who can't refrain from opening up with insults. you already have the most control possible over the game. stop playing if it doesn't work for you. since you are expressing your opinion that the forum is for morons to express their opinions....i find i have to agree that it does go down like that sometimes.
11/24/2010,bad troll is bad.
11/24/2010,"csm is just a joke now.they killed it with the announcement that they wouldn't be working on eve for 2 years.either listen to the csm *before* releasing features that ruin the game, or just kill it."
11/24/2010,what exactly have the csm done anyways? (that ccp couldn't figure out by reading the forums occasionally)
11/24/2010,agreed.
11/24/2010,"unsupported, and op is a nonsencial silly billy who needs to learn the pew-pew rather than qq on the forums.*proud carebear*"
11/24/2010,"actually compared to the more recent csm's of the past, this one is pretty good.it's actually restored my faith in the process as a whole."
11/24/2010,"the people on this csm have done a great job. i'm not sure what you mean that they have failed. they presented the issues that people voted for in the assembly hall. when ccp basically responded ""yeah whatever"" the csm made this very clear to the players and put ccp in a position that they had to address some of the items.in dominion and tyranis i'm not sure any proposals were incorporated by ccp. now we have rockets getting a boost, t2 ammo getting a boost, ghost datacore production got whacked. i think there are other changes as well. these items were not on the radar due to what appeared to be a busy schedule for the incarna and dust. now they are getting done. it is because of how csm handled the situation.none of these changes are a big deal to me personally. but then again the proposals in that get support in the assembly hall generally are just requests for minor tweaks. so its not the csms fault they are not changing the game dramatically. fact is the players never can agree on any dramatic changes.my only concern with csm is they seem a bit insulated from players. they have private message boards where it appears most of their work goes on. i would bet they are posting more there than in jita speakers corner. i think that is unfortunate because its hard to know who to vote for if you never really see what positions they hold. its sort of like ccp used to post here on the forums then they stopped. so they got a csm to represent players and use jita park forum to interact. now the csm no longer posts there as they have their internal forums where they hash things out. perhaps we need a csm to the csm to find out what they are up to. but this trend of the players getting further and further removed from ccp is not good. imo."
11/24/2010,pirates are completely destroyed? if that's even true... it's most likely due to level 5 missions and such that pirates now run. lowsec incentives failed to lure people to lowsec and instead converted pirates to carebearism. i guess there was a bunch of pirates who went to wormspace also. as for caldari pvp. if we look at the only valid true pvp. capship pvp. in top 10 recent kills as i type this. 3 of them were caldari. for the last 5 capship kills. 4 of 5 top damage dealers were caldari; only beat by a nyx. plenty showing from caldari. so that aside. lets discuss csm. before they existed... people posted ideas and when **** never got implemented they blamed ccp. so ccp created csm to filter the ideas and then when something doesnt get implemented. people blame csm. csm performs this purpose absolutely awesomely.if you think for a second that csm has any power to change what ccp is doing. you are quite naive. now their continues threads and dev blogs with the propaganda saying they do is quite false. you see csm discusses every topic about balance and proposals. ccp knows these things and plans to fix them whenever. then when the topics start getting fixed. they check off as if they were successful. however go back and see how many failures they've had... and you'll understand.
11/24/2010,"i don't think you need to worry too much. the csm has had an internal forum for over 2 years, although it is getting used a lot more now than it was. a lot of what goes on in there is nda stuff that we couldn't discuss anyway.i am quite happy to give my opinion on any topic, to the extent that the nda allows, and i suspect that most of the rest of the csm is the same way. i monitor jita park and assembly hall daily, and post if i think i can do so constructively.in addition, you can get a good feeling about what positions csms hold by reading the meeting minutes and the various summit reports, and i have no doubt that when election season comes around, we will all be focused on answering questions about our positions as we busily wh*re for votes.and tbh, if time spent working in the internal forums has cut down on time available to post in jita park, then that is a good thing overall -- it means ccp is communicating with us more, which means we have more opportunities to get things done for the players."
11/24/2010,"csm didn't immediately make everything perfect forever for me personally so therefore it is 100% a waste of time.in other news, i am not what is wrong with the rl political process today."
11/24/2010,"dear op, you are an idiot.second learn to read patch notes, we got a hole lot fixed in the past 6 months cause of mynxee's crew. new server hardware, rocket fix in a few days. even better fleet fights.third, look at the csm members, there isnt a single carebear on the list.forth, be thankful you are on an alt, rest assured posting with your main would get you shot.blaa blaa blaa blaa ok im bored typing now."
11/24/2010,"have you participated in mynxee's ""make lowsec matter"" project?"
11/24/2010,"i've always been a big coh/cov fan, and i was thinking about the pve experience today. coh has a mission creator, which has added a lot of content to the game. has there ever been discussion about this kind of thing for eve? it would make running pve stuff a lot less boring, because the content would be a lot more dynamic.thoughts:* each tier of mission has a bounty allowance, as well as a high and low cap as far as ship difficulty goes* a mission can be flagged as whatever style (intel, security, etc) the author thinks makes sense* the content of the mission (all of the text, etc) would be subject to community voting/review* the winners would get reviewed by ccp for inclusion in the game.* abuse would be limited due to the community review, the allowances, and ship restrictions.this would sort of crowdsource the act of creating new missions, which would take some burden off of ccp employees that want to work on other, more interesting things.what do people think?"
11/24/2010,should elaborate more. how ever i'm pretty sure that unlike coh/cov it probably couldn't happen due to game mechanics.+for merit.
11/24/2010,"i don't know that it couldn't happen - i'm imagining some client that exists outside of the regular eve client, which would let you position static objects, spawn/warp locations, etc. it could be pretty basic to begin with - create a trigger system that could be attached to different object types (ship, structure, etc) that include proximity warnings, destruction, etc. triggers can cause spawning, sequence starts, etc.it would work with our game mechanics if the mission code were standardized and streamlined in such a way that it could be modular in the way described above. once a mission is submitted and packaged up, the notion is that it could be easily dropped into the mission hoppers (after getting signed or whatever) after community and ccp review goes through.i don't think it would be too much of a stretch, to be honest."
11/24/2010,writing missions could be a viable activity in the isd volunteer program.
11/24/2010,i support this as well. eve need new players.
11/24/2010,"while i'm not against the idea, this is ultimately eve and not star trek online."
11/24/2010,i'm against. lets not call this startrek.
11/24/2010,"to be completely honest guys, i never watched a single episode/film of startrek.. i have vague idea that it is also happening in space, but thats about it. i'm getting idea completely out of pvp practice in eve space, since i am mainly station warrior and station hugging enemies are my worst nightmare, since they are only waste of ammo..i still think, although there has to be ofc alot of tweaking and some limitations, that tractors should work on ships and drones too.."
11/24/2010,"you should use a different module than you average run-of-the-mill tractor beam for it, though. i mean, seriously, turning a pve-only module into a pvp oner just like that? next we know, salvagers fire decloaking rays... and ofc the new module, being basically an ew one, would have to be allocated in mid slots..."
11/24/2010,supported
11/24/2010,excellent idea. i look forward to it being implemented as it's somewhat surprising that it hasn't already been. supported
11/24/2010,"i was doing some mining in a hauler today, and saw a person with the word crotch on his name, i decided to petition it realizing it was literally pointless after-words.so this is a topic to bring it up.as minor as it is, i think immediate bans would be the action.there are to many people getting away with inappropriate words for names and im not sure what the rating of eve is suppose to be, granted that there is none of any language filters. i found over 100 cases of the inappropriate nature. i think this need to be addressed even if it is small."
11/24/2010,crotch is not an offensive term. in fact it is a polite term for that region of the body compared to oh any of the other 50+ terms i can think of. i think you need to chill out and let people express themselves.mind the language please. spitfire
11/24/2010,doesn't matter this game is played by younger players. and while it is in the petitions to be reported. i stand firm on reasoning.
11/24/2010,same was said for an idiot called v####a monologue and that char's name was removed.so i throw your stupid reasoning right back in your face pal.the point is not whether this game is full of adults or not... majority of which have the brains of kids as it is.its whether eve online should have filth or not.i won't pretend to even fathom where that line should be drawn... but the fact it keeps getting crossed is the problem.and furthermore... its not the name or the word...its the idea behind it... and that is what needs to be stopped.
11/24/2010,thus is my point of addressing this.
11/24/2010,"i didn't support the idea because i'm not sure banning would even help let alone be effective enough.as it is...its likely too harsh.losing the name to a generic ""minmatar citizen 3252352352"" is hilarious enough for me."
11/24/2010,i could support that.
11/24/2010,erm... that's what they do... if they find your name unacceptable they use a randomizer on you.did you think people actually named themselves that? :) *tease*
11/24/2010,"eve is for everyone, id hate to see a loss of player(subscriptions) to parents seeing their child chatting to some guy named *****111 in the game."
11/24/2010,"hello, your concern is unwarranted, as this game eve is rated t- not including actions by players.if ""words"" offend a teenager they shouldn't by playing online, or games in general, well maybe they should just die. sorry but its true, its a damn word, oh i said damn, im offending you, go cry in the corner, k thanx."
11/24/2010,"no, your missing the point. its not general language-use. and its not just for teens. eve does aim for the older community but it is for everyone."
11/24/2010,i want to vote no to this idea...no.
11/24/2010,"it must have have been an awful long time since you've been a teen if you think they're mentally unprepared for naughty naughty language. i'm not sure if you meant to sound like a pseudo-socialist douchebag, but thats what it comes across as when you capitalize ""everyone"". eve is not for everyone. eve is for paying customers who's parents, if they're above recommended age but not adults, are supposed to be taking a hand in their entertainment choices. there is already a system in place to deal with it. if a name ****es you off petition it and if it's a eula violation it will get dealt with. i certainly wouldn't hate to see ccp lose subscriptions of overly square busybodies because they don't cancel subscriptions of gritty, harsh players in their gritty, harsh mmo."
11/24/2010,fair argument. but the names are abusing the eula and are still being broken. there are lines that has been laid out.
11/24/2010,crotchthe word is not even filtered on the forums. seriously bro. chillax.bans for name violations? i would have hated to grow up in your household if those are the types of consequences you think are appropriate for the crime.
11/24/2010,"whats the first thing that comes to mind when u hear the word ""crotch""? and it has nothing to do with my household. besides i didnt say anything about crotch being the target of this topic now did i? inappropriate names are."
11/24/2010,"when i think of the word crotch, i think of the place between a person's legs.what is so inappropriate about that? we've all got something there, why is it inappropriate to talk or make jokes about it. inappropriate names are funny and fine. if you are seriously offended, or think any child's parent who lets them play online games really cares, you need to go back to your bible."
11/24/2010,"you can already report inappropriate character names through petition system. they will be reviewed and, if necessary, the character in question will be renamed to ""<characterrace>citizen <datecreated>"" (""amarrcitizen 20060101""... for example). if you find some name offensive, please file a petition and don't suggest solutions to problems that doesn't exist or already have solutions."
11/24/2010,"oh btw, i have an eve box sitting on my desk right in front of me.it clearly says t for teen not e for everybody.but nice try."
11/24/2010,"there are too many people getting away with inappropriate words for names. -there is a petition section for it. i would gladly report them. but this would just make things simpler.fact is, it aint funny. it is not humorous, its vulgar and it shoots the respects of this game that other players do have for it. -has nothing to do with me personally but about respecting the game i play."
11/24/2010,nice try yourself. read again what ive said thus far.
11/24/2010,"actually, i'm pretty sure complaining about it here is much less effective than simply petitioning them."
11/24/2010,"that is why it is here.there can easily be something to work into the system to kill the remain and continued use of inappropriate names. i love playing eve, not seeing someone making a joke of a character(within eve gaming mechanics)."
11/24/2010,"yes, that system is called ""petitions""."
11/24/2010,"sadly, i'm doing that already. but that is kinda being lazy about it. which btw is action. -not a system."
11/24/2010,"you don't consider filing a petition to be actioned by a gm a ""system""? what dictionary are you using?"
11/24/2010,not the same system that could be implied.
11/24/2010,but back to topic. id would appreciate it if there was an improvement on inappropriate name usage conditions. with-out an excessive use of petitions.i play eve. i should not have to be flying along and see a player named inappropriately cause they thought it would be funny. there is a line of things people should not do. maturity is implied not adultery.
11/24/2010,"yes, one does come to that conclusion considering you've bothered making this thread. unfortunately for you the current system works just fine. i'd much rather have incarna, factional warfare fixed, incursions or any one of a dozen other things than a redundant, additional system for dealing with names beyond petitions."
11/24/2010,its not that hard. would take but mere hours for something to what i'm suggesting and those things are gonna happen regardless of what may or could be done now.
11/24/2010,"even more rigorous than what we already have, which i'm assuming is pretty standard in mmorpgs?....1. why?2. i seriously doubt the quantity of name-related petitions in eve can be described as excessive.no, that is not the case. you do not have the right to exist in society and expect us to all conform to your every whim and personal morality like little automatons. if you want to play a multiplayer game, you are simply going to accept that not everyone agrees with you. end of story.it becomes even more ridiculous when a system already exists in answer to your complaint, petitions, and you for some obscure reason are not satisfied.which is why we have petitions. ......what?"
11/24/2010,you couldve just voted no a long time ago. it never had anything to just me. but it does include me there are many others that would think the same as both arguments continue. true the name peitions may not be excessive but then why hasnt it been done?
11/24/2010,"i did.i don't see them here supporting your idea. because if petitions aren't excessive, then coming up with another system would be a waste of time?....."
11/24/2010,"nice, so im ranting then? dont think so. it is not a waste of time since it is a part of this game."
11/24/2010,"seeing as this game has a ""t"" rating, certain things are to be expected. such as ""inappropriate"" names, among other things.if you have a problem with it, petition it or stop playing. banning someone for making a name that is ""inappropriate"" is completely stupid."
11/24/2010,how so?
11/24/2010,"so teen means be inappropriate? i thought thats what 18+ (m+) was... (that would make it adult)this game would require age verification if that was the case.this game is teen and in many cases is language and vulgar words usage being observed and or restricted. so it is stupid to allow it, since literally it's not! nameing policies"
11/24/2010,"it's really sad to see such intolerance and ignorance being spouted over someone having the freedom to name their imaginary internet spaceship character how they want. no this game is not rated t. this game is unrated because it is online and online interactions are not rated by the esrb. i'm not sure how you could be unaware of this fact since it is right next to the t and is the policy in every other online game ever. you logic is astounding. it is almost impossible to find a place to start. you think v####a and crotch are equally offensive terms? what planet are you on? a game designed for children should have more restrictions and games for adults should have less restrictions, that makes sense. your logic is saying that either we shouldn't put more restrictions on games for children or we should baby-proof every video game. both are ridiculous. i have also yet to see even the most devout critic label 'crotch' as an offensive term. this is the whole point of the op, he is just petitioning any name that doesn't fit his personal criteria, well guess what pal this is everyone's game not just yours.the end all be all is that if you have a problem with a name then petition it. if you want a system based on your personal views of what is appropriate then you are delusional. especially when your views of acceptability are so far off what a reasonable person would think.this is not something against offensive names, those will be dealt with by people petitioning ccp. this is about one guy trying to push his personal standards of what he thinks is a correct character name forced onto everyone else. and you want people banned for making a joke in a video game. cripes."
11/24/2010,"honestly gallion, i can see your point, but if you really think a name is that offensive, just petition it and be on your way.the only thing that really gets my back up is the **** crap the pops up now and then in player/corp names and descriptions. if they take a hard line on anything, it should be that.edit: n word is censored?"
11/24/2010,"@vaal & few others.your attacking me? seriously did u not read the naming policies? nice speech and all but your just saying that i'm wrong, and clearly i'm not, by saying that more should not be done about it and that since they are ignoring rules put up"
11/24/2010,"not supported. in my opinion eve should be rated ""m"". including non filtered names, even if you .. uh ... happen to be sensitive enough to find them offensive to you. you can always go and shoot him in the face over it. in game ofc."
11/24/2010,"lol. i shouldnt have to be the one to petition it, it should not exist."
11/24/2010,"regardless, you're asking a lot. just look at how bad the word filter on the forums is? this is the kind of thing that causes unnecessary problems for a number of people who *do* go with regular names."
11/24/2010,sure let see if ccp will agree to making eve-online now mature. while we're at it incarna we could have half-naked character/npc in the medical room.
11/24/2010,no its not. not hard at all.
11/24/2010,"i find some name fastidious and showing a immature mentality but i don't think that a automated filter will resolve much. in eve we speak languages from all the world. i am almost sure that the word ""***ioli"" (beans in italian) will be censored by the automatic filter as the first 3 letters are an offensive term in the usa. [qed] filtering every possible offensive word and variations even in the principal languages would block a large number of innocuous terms. so the most common forms should be censored automatically while the ""inventive"" ways to bypass the filter should be reported by the players that feel offended and speak the relevant language. in the meantime we can treat players showing that kind of immaturity like people of their apparent mental age."
11/24/2010,"so you're happy to sit down and sift through over 100,000 character names to make sure nothing's slipped through and messed up?"
11/24/2010,where did i mention anything about automated filtering? cause their aint no mention of such. read up.
11/24/2010,"its more like 4mill by now. and ive already been doing that. but being limited to ""2"" open petitions dosent help, not to mention it trunicate the list to max25."
11/24/2010,"ah, so you *are* stupid enough to assume that ccp have the time/manpower to do that? well, that concludes my presence on this thread."
11/24/2010,"if respect for the game i lovingly play is stupid, then yes. cause they wouldnt even break a sweat. but note that i didn't say implicit such."
11/24/2010,"uhm, 9/10?"
11/24/2010,"i have taken this as a suggestion for a automated system, seeing how having a gm screening all the names on 300k active accounts, plus inactive accounts, plus corporations, plus alliances and keeping up to date with all the new names being added every day would have a heavy manpower cost."
11/24/2010,#NAME?
11/24/2010,"well motivated reply. what is simply wrong? the time needed to screen the eve universe manually is short?there will be no new inappropriate names?or, as you had already explained above, that you don't want a automated system?i have simply explained why i had reached the (wrong) conclusion that you were suggesting something automated and why i feel that doing it manually will be problematic."
11/24/2010,"so it's hard to change a name? or ban a person?im sure the complex code to retreive a single ship due to error or faults is way more tasking then what i've already suggested. which btw would be the very thing we're still conversing about. i can petition, they'd still have to go about it that is not automated. but if my understanding is correct be no harder then use the window search functions."
11/24/2010,"since when was crotch offensive? or inappropriate?the last i heard, ""crotch"" was allowed before the watershed, which makes it perfectly suitable for general use to people above the age of about 7.just because you think it is inappropriate or offensive doesn't mean that it actually is. if you think it is, then i'll have to turn to the ""i think the name gallion is offensive"" argument. i think i might petition that.and before you say that my name is offensive or inappropriate, it's the name of a skin cream my sister uses."
11/24/2010,you obviously you didn't read everything... crotch wasn't the target of the topic. think about the fact that im still sayin it. i know what it means and i know its not a viable word to censor but word of the sexually derogatory are. (the aim of this topic)
11/24/2010,"gallion, please qq. this game is too advanced for you."
11/24/2010,yeaaah ok. read naming policies bud. fyi been playing lot longer then you.
11/24/2010,"here i'll make it apparent.character and corporation names may not: be racially or ethnically or sexually derogatory; contain profanity; suggest an affiliation with a real-life hate group or figurehead. they may not impersonate a member of the eve online team, s&si staff, cs staff or volunteer corp. alternative spellings will be viewed with the same scrutiny as traditional spellings. names used in the game are also reserved and may not be used in whole or part. infraction of these rules may result in a mandatory name change or ban at our discretion.note that the list is not all-inclusive and names that violate our rules can be changed by customer support staff, even if they could be inserted in the character creation process. that qq for ya?"
11/24/2010,not to long ago there was a campaign to end the isk spamming. that broke eula. this topic is no different.
11/24/2010,i find your name offensive as it is a direct link to neopia which is a peadophiles playground which has links with scientology.'nuff said.
11/24/2010,"this topic is entirely different. isk spammers are ruining the game, people with ridiculous names aren't. it's your problem if you get easily offended.ccp is merely protecting themselves against lawsuits. current system does the job, there's no reason to do more just to satisfy a bunch of prudes.petition if you find something extreme, then go back playing the game."
11/24/2010,"so op wants us all to be mature and not offend the young kids playing the game with our names, but then expects the same level of maturity from those young kids?me thinks op is completely out of touch with reality."
11/24/2010,"i'm sort of on board with the op but for different reasons.i have seen some names that i think help explain why we do not have more women playing eve. or at least not fcing where they would have to repeatedly say the names of targets. (i'm not saying *all* women, i'm sure many don't mind but i would think many would not be up for it.) this i agree is a bad thing. but anyway, i personally never really understood the whole ""bad word"" concept. so i am not overly sympathetic. where i grew up people would sprinkle ""bad words"" into their language all the time. i think the focus of any such activity shouldn't be ""protecting children"" from hearing a bad word, but instead making sure the game isn't obnoxious to certain groups."
11/24/2010,"i cant stand people like you. just because you don't like something, shouldn't mean that no-one should be able to like it. if you don't like their name, which is not really offensive at all, you can choose not to look at it. just because you dislike the word crotch, doesn't make it offensive to everyone, nor should it be banned.i think you should be banned.. you are an amarr slaver. your crimes are too great to allow you to exist!"
11/24/2010,"it is not me, its the naming policy your attacking. i can bring it up as many time as i like as it is a policy that must be read before playing the game/ creating your character.i dont care if you hate me thats your issues. and this is eve's by allowing inappropriate name to come in-game breaks the naming policies that is no different then isk spamming, for mature game it wouldn't be an issue but there is a np, and this game is teen. teen is ages 13+ thank you very much."
11/24/2010,"sure, but you are saying someone should be banned for the word ""crotch"" in their name. the issue is that where you draw the line for inappropriate and what someone else might, are different, especially for a word like crotch. my parents routinely used that word throughout my childhood and i have no inclination that it is offensive at all, but someone like you believes it is. hell, i am sure your kid has heard the word ""crotch"" in school countless times even before they are 13, and i highly doubt any teacher or school administrator would discipline a child saying it.obviously there are some words that the vast majority of people would find offensive, however for the remainder of them, i don't believe its you or ccps job to judge their appropriateness. just ignore it and get on with life."
11/24/2010,"no, go to the begining of this topic you missed some. and what biz do u have judging me for elborating the np. naming policies"
11/24/2010,"""crotch"":racially derogatory: noethnically derogatory: nosexually derogatory: nocontain profanity: nosuggest an affiliation with a real-life hate group or figurehead: noimpersonate a member of the eve online team: nonames used in the game: noseems ok to me.."
11/24/2010,"ok, no go further back. you still missing the point. -that this is not a discussion about the word crotch. its about he vulgar inappropriate names."
11/24/2010,"what spawned your topic was the word ""crotch"" in someone's name, which you disliked, and petitioned. so obviously the word crotch made you so mad you wanted to get revenge and ban someone."
11/24/2010,sure. lets go with that you people are not very good at this anyway. it would be my proposal to state that open petition limit should be raised. and the currant inappropriate names that are in game now can be dealt with.
11/24/2010,"incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization annoy me. i live with my disappointment in the human condition just as you should, silently. well, usually.perhaps including variations of hamburger in your name should be restricted since hindu consider the cow a sacred creature. or are we only respecting western sensibilities? just the other day i saw cheeseburgerdeluxe or something of that nature. add him/her/it to the list!for some reason some people don't like being called stewardess, preferring flight attendant. let's categorically stamp out the use of male/female based profession names since they may be considered derogatory. oh man we can add so much to this list.or we could be tolerant. you're the one acting immature. words mean what you build them up to mean. someone told you crotch was naughty, and like the god-fearing simpleton that you are you apparently went with it. not everyone feels the same, including plenty of parents.petition it. petition all of the names mommy told you were bad. ccp will decide if she was right. this doesn't need to be here."
11/24/2010,"no. your response to attack me is immature. your ignoring the facts.so i'll elaborate here, by denying anything ive said during the begining of this topic the player(s) whom have attacked me with glorified words are interested in destroying the rules that ccp placed, and that players whom have gotten away with this should not get punished? that is what im seeing in every reply that has been aimed at me."
11/24/2010,"it's up to them to enforce their rules. they have a system in place to allow you to participate in that enforcement by reporting violations. you are free to do so. they are just as free to decide if the instance has broken their rules and merits enforcement of them. a thread in the assembly hall will do nothing to correct the problem that you believe exists.on the other hand, i'm really digging the random capitalization over here."
11/24/2010,"your no better then trolls by saying anything out of the topic. which is somehting should be done about inappropriate names in-game(which is described in their np).i play eve, and i do not attempt to break from the guidelines made and agreed-upon when you first start your client & game & character. (which ill point my finger at more then 90% of you forum readers)"
11/24/2010,"the fact remains that you are using an example ""crotch"" which does not meet the requirements to have a name containing it removed. therefore we can conclude that many of the other names that you personally find offensive and claim violate the rules actually don't. all you will be doing is wasting the gm's time.the players haven't gotten away with anything because nothing wrong has been done. they won't be punished because there is no point to punish them."
11/24/2010,troll. read the policies then come and say that again.
11/24/2010,"gallion, have you noticed that you are the only person here upset by this? seriously, i don't care, and i doubt anyone else does either. if you find inappropriate names this upsetting, that you need to rant in a nebulous thread in assembly hall about it, what the heck are you doing playing an mmorpg?"
11/24/2010,and your not doing the same?
11/24/2010,"well, lets see: i haven't actually been ranting about an issue nobody cares about, but rather chuckling at you, so i'd say not."
11/24/2010,"sorry, wasnt clear with last post. your trolling too? the fact that i did start this topic mean that ther are those who do care there even a few positive replies to my point. but while u ""chuckle"" at me. this was not the topic."
11/24/2010,"so i suppose that it should be okay to run around with any name we want, using your logic, and if we don't like it, well, sucks to be us.or, we could be adults and realize that there needs to be some standards of decency in the game.i think the renaming solution that we have right now is perfectly acceptable though; no need to add a ban on top of it."
11/24/2010,"i do low-sec exploration and the mag sites there are so incredibly worthless that these days, being older and wiser, i don't bother with them because they're a waste of time. why should i spend 10-15 minutes of my life just to get 100k in crap salvage?"
11/24/2010,"i do most of my exploring in hi-sec, starting to do some roams through lo-sec (working on some ship skills so i can run an all in one exploration vessel, swapping around is a pain in low :p ) and i support this.i have been tracking the loot values from radar and mag sites since i started exploring and found that in hi-sec on average radar sites are worth 15million (varies from 0, damn empty cans to about 50m), mag sites are worth less than half a million (absolute best i got was about 12mill for a condensed alloy i-beam thingy, usually less than 100k in value)obviously i don't think they need to be buffed up to null levels of reward, but it would be nice if they were consistent with the average for radar. i do them anyway, just to despawn them, but they definately aren't returning value at this point in time.edit: drone 'plexes are pretty ordinary as well :)"
11/24/2010,"or leave learning, but remove all the attribute skills and replace them with a ""study"" skill that adds 2 to each attribute per level.supporting the overall idea none the less."
11/24/2010,"supported, learning skills have been a barrier to entry for a lot of people i tried to get into the game."
11/24/2010,hell yeah.. this is one of the first learning skill proposals that actually makes sense.
11/24/2010,yes
11/24/2010,"i likes. side suggestion why not jus have some new 2-attribute skills books.ie book that would give 2% more to willpower and intelligence per level?( i know their is only 5 attributes, but swing with me here)"
11/24/2010,"supported!remodelling ""learning"" to a +20% learning speed per level skill is most appropriate and, as mathemathically proven here, boosts training time moar."
11/24/2010,"i think any solution is going to seem extreme to those of us with 6m sp in learning, but to address your concern and the better idea put forward:keep 'learning' as is, but add two skills: basic self improvement (+1 to all attribs, 1x) and advanced self improvement. (+1 to all attribs, 2x, and reqs bsi lvl 4 and learning lvl 4."
11/24/2010,"i support the original position and the position that makes it work for implants. i don't support making the new ""not learnings learnings"" take as long (or close to as long) as the old ones. nothing would be solved that way. the problem is that people need to have those skills if they want to play for any lenght of time and fly most anything (inb4 go tackle n00b).replacing a number of ""you must train this"" skills with a single ""you must train this"" skill that takes a substantial amount of time won't do anything in practical terms. the problem is the huge roadblock these constitute to playing the game, particularly for new people.there is something certainly flawed in the notion that they are ""optional"" and ""deepen"" the game when every piece of advice is ""get them"" in the skills forum, and every corp recruitment officer wants them. and you can't train without them either.the whole system needs to go and this proposal is getting worse rather than better."
11/24/2010,^ agree. minimize learning skills absolutely as much as possible. i'd do away with them entirely if i was given the choice.
11/24/2010,"you have a point, which is the whole point of my proposition, nobody is going to be completely happy with the result, but i think the op solves most of the issues, and the 'implant problem' should have no bearing on this. implants need their own review."

11/24/2010,read some of csm meeting minutes and it seamed like their was a lack of direction for what should be done in stations.what is lacking in eve is an open area to build. i would really like to see us able to build our own areas and do what ever we can with space. give us legos and let us build a wonderful corporation bar with them. using basic building blocks(not really legos) would let people great so amazing and weird things.carbon seems to have a physics engine at least on some level so even making something like a water fall that falls into a little pond as part of your quarters in that station would be neat.or taking it further letting people build crazy contraptions and structures such as mind craft and have the space for rent. maybe the corp would rent a large area and people would work together to create a lounge with stripper poles and a fully stocked bar. could also higher npcs if we wished. i am sure once the tools are their even more creations will be possible.would sure beat spinning your ship.
11/24/2010,"okay, but.. to what end?i mean, don't get me wrong; a nice social hangout is a great idea. i can't be the only one who wants to head over to jita 4-4 and hang around the bars watching people come and go. but there's got to be some kind of context for that. why would people come to the bars in the first place? socialization? there are already channels for that.the problem with incarna is that it's a load of very cool tech that's looking for a reason to exist. in the world of spaceships, it's hard to find significance in the individual captain, because.. well, the captain is just so damned small. it's hard to think of anything that you could put in incarna that you couldn't just put somewhere else.i think it's a chicken and egg scenario. in most worlds you'd get the idea of a pilot getting in his spaceship. in eve, it's the idea of the pilot leaving his spaceship. the unspoken assumption is that there's no real reason for a pilot to leave his ship in the first place. we spend all our time in there now; why would we ever need to leave?don't take my lack of support personally; it's not so much that i don't agree with your ideas. in principle, i do. but we've got far bigger problems at the moment."
11/24/2010,no. start spinning your ship.

11/24/2010,"for (3), the duplicates can be identified by the community at the time the crowdsourcing is being done. at the end of the crowdsourcing process, simply combine the nominations for those items the community deemed to be duplicates.for (2), it's really up to ccp to estimate how long a proposal will take to implement. the idea of crowdsourcing is to determine the priorities of items, not the implementation plan. thus we can build a list of the things the community wants most, and ccp + csm can work out the implementation schedule after the top 5 have been selected. much better for csm to be spending time investigating only 5 priority items, rather than 200.i agree with (1) - each csm item should have a reference to the crowdsourcing efforts that it has been raised in, along with a comprehensive as possible a list of threads dealing with that issue. some issues have been done to death (boost destroyers/afk cloaking/defending industrials), it would be nice to have an easy reference for people to research existing proposals before they launch a new one."

11/24/2010,"sansha incursions are basically groups of players banding together to go on a quest to kill npc's instead of other players. there's even ""progression"" from easier to harder sansha sites. sound familiar?i propose that ccp scrap incursion and instead devote an entire expansion to bug fixes as well as fixing a few broken components, like failguns and t2 large scanning rigs dropping from exploration sites."
11/24/2010,"i'm not going to lie; i'm skeptical about incursions. i mean really skeptical. i'm about 90% sure they'll crash and burn and the forums will erupt into a state of chaos and hellfire, causing ccp to backpedal faster than an olympic cyclist caught face to face with a freight train.but.. it's basically too late at this point. they've already poured a ton of developer resources into it, so it'd be foolish to ask them to scrap all that work now.apparently one of the main reasons no hybrid ""fixes"" have been implemented is because nobody can really decide what they need that won't either be overpowered or else cross over into the territory of a different turret type. why not work on a proposal for how to fix them?but in the mean time, we might as well just see how incursions go."
11/24/2010,"i thought that was the point of this entire ""invasion"" :p"
11/24/2010,"i predict i'll log off for a week when they inevitably find their way to my constellation. and yes, from what i've seen on sisi, this is an expansion best not released. when i first heard about it i thought it would be cool and exciting. it could add so much to the game. but as always the demon is in the details. as with virtually all pve content, ccp chose to make it boring and grindy rather than interesting and challenging. they gave the npc's cheats rather than intelligence and that's a sure fire way to make it irritating for players instead of fun."
11/24/2010,no. its part of their conditions an expansion is gonna happen. incursions is a great step and from what im hearing from testing its gonna be dangerous for most miners.
11/24/2010,"by griefer decs, they mean decs that fall outside of corporate strategy or role playing; e.g. decs for tear extraction and free pvp on noobs by veteran corps in search of their jollies at the expense of new players.typically, these are the groups that that use the ""it's a sandbox"" claim as an excuse to kick sand in your face while they high five each other for killing players with 1/50th their skill and experience."
11/24/2010,not supported because it is just hitting the player-base with a big stick to force them to do what you want.buffing low-sec > nerfing high-sec
11/24/2010,"so are you saying that some some corps should be immune to wardecs perhaps?perhaps a corp for noobs, and starting players.i can envision these corps being full of new players, in fact, as soon as one creates a player, they could be automatically placed in such a corp to facilitate the process!for those older characters who wish a little bit of solace from the harshness of eve's unforgiving nature, they can also elect to leave their current corp, by themselves, or with their friends and join one of these ""new player"" corps as well, so there is a balance. to fit with the role play of eve, ccp could come up with some cool rp backstory and descriptions of these ""new player corps"" to give them a bit of fluff. think about it. everybody wins!!"
11/24/2010,i am confirming this idea sounds good and i will support this suggestion over the op
11/24/2010,"since it sounds like one of the strongest objections is that the first alliance to build cap ships would just own the place, what if the idea was modified to disallow building cap ships in these isolated regions of k-space? i realize that would be more development effort (the idea without that is just a map change), but probably nothing too difficult. the game has the concept of limiting pos arrays depending on system security level already, so adding a new attribute of a system that also disallows cap assembly arrays seems possible."
11/24/2010,"hi i have bug reported this issue - aparently it has been fixed in an internal ccp build it will probably hit sisi and tq at some point in the next few mounths. the reason no one has responded to this is because its not a particulay major problem or a long outstanding issue and the problem is clearly a defect. as such bug reporting is the first point of call, only should that fail to fix the issue in several itterations should it realy be a matter for the cms's attention. if you spot any other item descriptions that are wrong, or game mechanincs which are definatly not working as intended - especialy if you can reproduce them i highly recommend visiting this link:"
11/24/2010,"in every major patch or expansion they fix a lot of typos, grammar errors, description errors, etc. that were reported on bug reporting page. we'll just have to wait (no need to bring this up in assembly hall really)."
11/24/2010,i say vote no to this.

11/24/2010,"the current start to new character i believes hampers new players. sure you can test everything out cuz they send you to trainers of all sorts. yes you technically get to 1.6m sp in about the same time. but here are teh downers1. you get a very sudden slow down of skill points. its kind of in reverse of what should happen you should get your feet wet first then get stuff running fast.2. character have a harder time getting into certain aspects of the game. its harder to do missions, you have larger waste in manufacturing to start, you mine less, ect...3. players have a harder time feeling like they are a combat pilot or an industrialist or miner or whatever and such may have a lower chance of staying in game.what do i suggest to fix it? you should be launched into space with 50k sp you start with now with an option to pick a proffession or do tutorials first. if you pick tutorials it lets you go straight into the game as it does now. at any point you want you can open up your character sheet and pick a proffession and it would be like the old school list you got to pick out. it would put skills up to the point to what you picked for your proffesion. so even if i were to pick say a combat proffesion and its gunna give me small laser 3 it would simply put it to 5. why is this nessesary? it will help keep newbies in the game and build a larger playerbase."
11/24/2010,"i wish they gave you the choice of whether you wanted the low sp start and accelerated training, or the specialized start with no accelerated training. i miss the specialized start for creating alts. free level 5's were awesome!"

11/24/2010,blobs are fine just make them harder to assamble and manage.if you can cross entire galaxy with entire fleet in no time no wonder you have what you have.
11/24/2010,"all it takes to reign in blob warfare to reasonable levels is to increase the relative size of the universe compared to the concentration and volume of player playing on a given day. if ccp can find a way to vary the size of the universe and/or travel times in proportion to population density on a daily/hourly basis, then there comes a point were the amount of time/logistics it takes to form a 'blob' fleet is simply not worth it.all in all, the eve universe feels too small. increase the quality of content in each system as well as the size of each system, reduce warp speed, and voila - people feel more inclined to stay within a constellation rather than roaming 30+ jumps across multiple regions.dilute the population density for eve's sake!"
11/24/2010,i'm not clear on why you can't just continue doing this?
11/24/2010,"woah, so much rage here.yes, plex for more sp/hr is bad, but that's not what ccp are doing/were going to do.how many plex would someone need to buy before they have a ridiculous advantage? too many :danyway, a nice outcome of this could be you can use a plex for a remap every 6 months.but, really, i couldn't care about the outcome of this because as i see it, there won't be huge implications by any decision discussed here.what would get my attention would be someone proving that a player could train up twice as fast without spending $1200 on plex :d"
11/24/2010,... you have got to be kidding me...there are 8 csm threads on your internal forums you say? mmmmmmm well that ends my involvement in trying to get you guys to do anything.
11/24/2010,"8 pages of threads. every page has 29 threads, so you do the math.i guess reading isn't always easy."
11/24/2010,dv
11/24/2010,"why? pretty much nothing but a reflection of the percentage of players/accounts that actually still can be bothered to vote for csm. what did you expect? 20+ pages threadnaught? c'mon, we all know how ccp likes to ignore those repeatedly, better to have some quality instead of quantity."
11/24/2010,"actually i would prefer if most of the csm discussion was here on eve-o in the jita park, assembly hall and features and ideas forums. i would prefer it if the csm actually discussed ideas with the players rather than with themselves. i see more than a few assembly hall topics were voted on by csm even though the csm member never mentioned what or why they would vote a certain way in assembly hall. if youre not interested enough in a topic to throw your ideas out in assembly hall so you can consider what the players think of them, then maybe you should sit that vote out. i understand ccp used to interact with players on the forums. now i suppose ccp thinks they can leave it to the csm to do this. if the csm no longer does this, then the csm is simply distancing the players even further from ccp.i think this csm is doing a great job. but this is one thing i think they can do better. the round table was nice but that format doesnt really allow the sort of follow up that a forum posting does. share more of your ideas and thoughts with the players on these forums that are specifically set up for that purpose."
11/24/2010,"plus... pretty much answers the question. if it were indeed in ""ccp's best interest"" to seriously look into this, it won't have resulted in just some lol-temp-bans but permabans rather. didn't happen. which makes the conclusion rather obvious that it's yet another time ccp paying merely some sort of lip service (no, i didn't write giving head to pl ), but not really bothering to get seriously involved. so basically some token action to quell possible customer unrest but in the end the well-known ""we don't care!"" attitude. go figure..."
11/24/2010,"except they apparently do, and so do i, and i know it isn't nearly as bad as you make it seem. admittedly it could be polished a bit, but it is just fine as is. and roll-back? god, no."
11/24/2010,"ya, like playing only on days that have eve run in pre-nano-nerf state or even pre-nos-nerf one. ofc your sp would have to be rolled back as well then, right?"
11/25/2010,got the ship and skills now (widow). its expensive and useless. i regret investing into this.i gonna reprocess it if it wont get unnerfed. at least the jump range needs a buff.
11/25/2010,"easy solution, just allow concord to crack eggs.break the law and we'll will blow up your ship and your pod! add some tacklers for concord 'gate camps' and watch people cry"
11/25/2010,"yes, no one want to hear us. ccp themselves says htfu, but look how my thread died, and how this one doing well."
11/25/2010,i don't support this proposal.
11/25/2010,"ahaha, all the suicide-ganker tears in this thread are fantastic.i haven't been suicide-ganked (or are at any risk to be. it's not like i undock with estamel's modified plex), and i'm not a suicide-ganker.a removal of the insurance payoff will be logical, and force suicide gankers to only pewpew at the uber-pros who can afford to lose things, not some poor and new player in a badger who happened to have sightly valuable loot."

11/25/2010,"sorry but anna is right and you are wrong as your entire counter argument about putting onself in a dangerous place relies on the incorrect assumption that hisec is supposed to be safe and as ccp have stated over and over, that is just not the case. and as for this remark...""suicide ganking completely takes any control or prevention away from the victim."".. utter cobblers... this guy has made a career out of it"

11/25/2010,"70kk - it is not a price for the best ship in class. also a daredevil cost is about 300kk in good fit, but daredevil is not so powerfull"
11/25/2010,no. these changes are unnecessary.
11/25/2010,i say it fine as is. peeps needs to learn how to fit a ship better when dealing with frig' hulls.
11/25/2010,"i agree with the principle in general. i don't think that a probe is necessary though - a player should be able to find asteroid belts with the on-ship scanner. maybe not all asteroid belts, but the common ones with lots of veldspar and scordite. this way very new players can get started right away."
11/25/2010,"i don't like the idea of removing belts, because belts are a natural thing and not having them would seem weird. they are also a pvp spot in low sec, and dropping them would mean more gate and station games. however maybe bring in planet rings, comets.also a better spead of the ore though the sec systems. living in caldari space i get the four common ores in belts and nothing more. being a newer player i have not yet gotten around to the probe skills required to find the rare ores in empire space. however travel to gal space and you find omber all over the belts their. kernite is sitting in amarr space belts and having not been to a belt in minie space i cant say anything but given its near both amarr and gal space, i wouldn't be shocked if it had both the omber and kernite. it seems given the prices of those, that if i wanna make some real money from mining i have to be willing to leave caldari space. either that, or be willing to continually take mining trips 18-20 jumps into other empire spaces. now seeing as an orca and hulk are not super fast at this whole flying deal im not in favor of that.so could be an idea to either limit the ores in empire, or randomise the second teir ores more. maybe the belts people use everyday change. one day lots of commons the next day a few second teir are their. or at lease even the playing field and give the caldari a second tier ore. not everyone can spend the time probing out a site or wh and move an orca and pos into it for a week. sure making mining more ""fun"" sounds like a good idea, buts its mining theirs only so much you can do."
11/25/2010,"i know eve is considered a universe and not a game, but having to find a game to play (or video to watch) to pass the time while you're mining is kind of ridiculous. i in no way support any measure that would increase mining yield, but making positioning important to yield is a good idea (less yield as you get further away). here's my idea: in the way that pi gave us a mini-game of setting up extractor networks and the like, a mining ship could go into an 'asteroid view', like looking through a mining laser turret at a target asteroid. the scanner could show deposits, and the varying amounts of ore on the asteroid in the same manner as the planets appear in pi (colour = density etc). then, you use the laser to shoot the good deposits, blasting them until the ore is depleted, and then you target a new area. each laser could be set on a seperate deposit, and you manage them and move them around as needed. when the roid is depleted, you select a new one, perhaps move closer, and repeat. this makes it into something entertaining (shoot those deposits! shoot them for profit!) and may possibly cut down macromining."
11/25/2010,i like the idea of updating the mining process but i think we all need to keep in mind (which i think we all do) that changing mining in even the smallest way will have larger impacts in the rest of eve. really the biggest change i would like to see is that the mining cycle be stopped the moment all the ore in an asteroid has been removed. that will save loads of time.
11/25/2010,supported.devs...caldari and gallente need some love.csm. take a look at this problem and prioritize this onto your list of things to look at.
11/25/2010,"supported!however, if i could suggest something- rather than having a separate bay, why not just have the ability to right click a drone and select 'repair'. depending on the size of the drone, the repair costs more, and this can be done per drone or per drone group. drones being repaired can't be launched until the repairs are complete, which for fighters or fighter bombers can take several minutes."
11/25/2010,"space barbie will be here soon enough. but those who've been following along have, most likely, noted a distinct lack of meaty content. no bueno.the core mechanics and content of eve shouldn't stop as soon as you get out of your pod.so, suggestions: 1) pew pew, pew pew. use the eventual world of darkness combat engine modified however is necessary or create a first person shooter style interface, doesn't matter. if you're not in your pod sitting in your ship in your hangar, someone can put a bullet in your brain. which brings me to:2) scooping out your grey matter like pumpkin innards. create a skill (say, rank 6) that has a 10% bonus per level, starting at 0% with the skill untrained, to salvage neural implants that a victim may have. this should not be competitive with lp store offers however, so after beta playtesting and balancing (i.e. once it goes live in an expansion and enough people complain), figure out a dynamic balance so that any implants that are dropped in this fashion have a certain amount of damage that can only be fixed by the use of certain consumable materials. ideally, tie those consumable materials into ""salvaged"" components from the neural interface that any undocked pod pilot will have to wear so that if they're fragged, their consciousness downloads to a new clone. also allow implants to be built from scratch with bpo's. 3) decks have their own security status in stations. (semi-independent of the systems stations are in)1.0 - 0.5 decks are like nyc under giuliani, a cop on every corner and a plunger up every ass. 0.4 - 0.1 decks are like beruit, sure there's a government presence of sorts but if it's cloudy with a chance of rpg's suddenly there are more important things to engage in, like continuing breathing.0.0 decks are a wretched hive of scum and villainy. anything goes here. want illegal weapons, buy them here. buying/selling the salvaged materials from some guy's skull you just perforated with high velocity ammo? that'd be here too.player owned stations in 0.0 (not ****ing pos, actual stations damnit) can be set up however their owners prefer. 4)guns. lots of guns.slug throwers, laser rifles, flechette pistols, microwave-death rays? yes. personal shields, ablative armor, flak jackets, reactive plating, powered armor? yes.illegal gear that's so awful (and awesome) that it's banned by all civilized nations and has to be snuck around? yes. accepting an assassination contract, cloaking up with thermoptic camouflage and performing an emergency trepanation via .50 cal incendiary round at 500 yards? yes, yes, yes yes yes. all gear is player made and sold. 5.this time, it's personal.war decs carry over in-station. kill rights are not only transferable, but outlaws who wander around a station can be exterminated with a bounty to be paid by concord.6. hey man, did you ever look at your hand? i mean really look? boost drug smuggling as a profession. in the seedier security zones in a station, players can purchase upgraded cargo containers which give back false scan results to customs ships, showing up as clean. containers have a limited number of uses.7. it's sweet that you think you have a choice.law enforcement is punitive, not prohibitive. cops in station highsec & bots in station lowsec will respond to crimes, but in both cases if you're good (or lucky) you should have time to paint the walls with your target's brain first.8. moar dakka!!!more reasons to de-pod and look around. no, not ****ing mini-games. arena (to the death) combat for isk, poker tournaments, etc...9. an offer you can't refuse.crime syndicates/law enforcements groups in stations who you can run missions for. faction warfare (including pirate factions) ranging from sabotage to smuggling to planting high explosives in the local police barracks. or blow out the windows on the observation lounge and let the ****ers suck vacuum."
11/25/2010,my definitive sci fi experience doesn't make me (or others) safe when i'm outside of my ship.
11/25/2010,"it's sad that 'space barbie' is such an apt description of incarna. i would also have accepted 'dancing in gay bars' as well.you've the the nail right on the head here mate, eve is a harsh universe, except when you're walking in stations apparently, then it's project runway - eve edition! it's taken ccp years to get incarna to this point, however, and like all the other things eve needs to survive and grow, it'll take years more for you to shoot another player with a plasma cannon on a station. which is about the only thing that'd coax me out of my ship, tbh."
11/25/2010,would love to wander up behind a war target whilst there playing poker/having a drink/whatever and shooting there brains out so there head smacks on the table old fashioned western style.
11/25/2010,"i agree with you that there needs to be ingame combat, but i disagree on some of the smaller points.i can't agree with you on highsec security. in highsec stations (not lowsec stations), police should be preventative, and doing a very good job of it too. if they're not, then those who can afford to and have the standings to buy jump clones can essentially have free reign in highsec. the only reason that's not an issue in space is because ships that can insta-gank aren't usually cheap, and i assume that a pistol is not anywhere near as expensive as the cheapest of frigates.perhaps, instead of making all of highsec in-station security forces either easy to circumvent or impossibly hard to outdo, a system of reaction times can be implemented.in 1.0 space, there's an instantaneous reaction, instantly killing the offender. in 0.9, that reaction is a few seconds slower. in 0.8, even slower, all the way down to 0.5, in which it can take as long as 15 seconds for there to be any response.i think it's perfectly understandable that ccp wants to hold out on tossing combat into the mix, however. with your method, people are hardly going to want to get out of the pod in lowsec or nullsec, because anything could happen.also, another reason ccp might want to hold out of combat in stations is because that would require an entirely new interface. out standard dropbox method of movement isn't viable in a combat situation.i think that for ingame hand-to-hand combat, you'll be better off waiting for dust514, as ccp has already begun development there."
11/25/2010,"fair enough, however, i'd still like to try to convince you. as you realize, i'm sure, concord isn't really preventative even in 1.0 systems. i also think you misunderstand my proposal. a simple pistol wouldn't be enough to kill anybody in station highsec, before the police responded at least, who was wearing something like personal armor and/or a shield. think of walking around a station without armor/shielding like flying an untanked frigate. and remember, outlaws will not only be kos, but players will collect bounties for shooting them. which isn't to say that suicide ganking won't go on in stations as i envision it, but it wouldn't be as simple as getting a pistol and blasting caps randomly. yep, that was my idea (but i ran into the character limit for the post). 1.0 in space isn't exactly instantaneous concord response either, but damn near close. think of 1.0 station security as analogous. it'd have to be playtested and balanced of course, and maybe in 1.0 simply unholstering a weapon would be considered a criminal violation and you might not have time to squeeze off a shot. remember, station highsec is still giuliani town nah. every station will have highsec decks, lowsec decks, and null sec decks. (again, ran into the character limit). think times square = highsec, alphabet city = lowsec, the projects = nullsec. think of it this way. highsec (space) stations will have lots of decks where respectable people do respectable people things. but they'll also have a few, out of the way decks where the cops maybe don't look too close or they're paid off to not care too much about. and then there are always places in a floating city-in-space where wicked stuff goes down and the cops don't go there at all because they're written off the inhabitants anyways. lowsec (space) would be similar. there would be a few decks of high sec (station), because after all respectable people need to do respectable people things. but there'd be a lot more lowsec (station) decks and a lot more areas where the police simply don't go. we're probably already going to need a new interface for space barbie anyways, and they can and should port over whatever they're developing for combat in wod if at all possible. dust will be console only, iirc. space barbie, however, will be in our games no matter what. we might as well make it awesome. oh, and supporting my own topic."
11/25/2010,"despite my lack of optimism that this will ever happen, i would dearly like it to.incarna should become ""eve 2"" - a full fledged game in its own right, with all the breadth of gameplay possibilities we've come to expect from ""eve prime"""
11/25/2010,this.
11/25/2010,"better to blend it into a pc version of dust 514, just in stations.no, i don't like this plan because it's not what space barbies were designed for. this might be a fun option for low sec or ""special"" combat-ready stations - like faction warfare control points."
11/25/2010,"to be honest, i think that the best way we can insure that something like this happens and that ccp doesn't leave space barbie to rot on the vine is to show our support. also, convince the csm to capture a few devs and hold them hostage over the icelandic volcano. but that showing our support part is probably optional. i don't care, really, if it's dust or wod, but ccp has got to produce real content using some engine or another and incarna is already based on the wod engine. and, strictly speaking, this is what space barbie was designed for; it's a byproduct of ccp's work on the world of darkness game. besides, even if it was simply engineered to show off nice shinies, it should be properly iterated so that's not all it is. as for a combat option only for some, i think that's contrary to the nature of eve. there's no such thing as safe space, only safer space and anything you have as an asset is potential loot for someone else. players should no more be safe from danger walking around jita 4-4 than they would be undocking from 4-4. otherwise, they might as well just give every eve player a subscription to second life and put in some spaceship themed backgrounds or something."
11/25/2010,"wardecs in station? no thanx, this would mean the only safe place in eve is when your logged out,wis should be optional, so there should be no need to walk around.i like the diffrent security of decks, but something like .8+ should be impossible to fight on, .5+ has guards that will kill anyone who attempts to suicide pwn even war dec.4 and below there are guards, but they will only attack whats in los, so sneaking around is what happens0.0 no or very little guard, i think here will be security cameras, that dispatch guards, so you have to run and hide before they see your drug deal.i think in the lower security area should be a shady fellow, to pay to raise your faction standing, this would mean no more grinding standing to be aloud in other faction space."
11/25/2010,"undocked = unsafe. de-podded = unsafe. ship spinning = safe. wardec = murder your opponents in front of the local police station at high noon, then go take a nap. as for places outside your hangar where it's impossible to fight, i think that really is strongly opposed to what makes eve, eve. and sure, it'd have to be playtested. security cameras/bots, sneaking, what have you, all fine. maybe in 1.0 walking around with a weapon that isn't hidden gets you shot and in 0.9 an unholstered weapon gets you shot and in 0.8 aiming at someone gets you shot, etc... i really don't know. i'm just sketching in broad outlines because i'd like to make sure that ccp develops some sort of content beyond space barbie."
11/25/2010,"so if there were an internet church in the station, you would disregard sanctuary for the epeen factor?everyone requires some place to conduct business or interactions that is safe (not safer). besides logging out of the game, this type of protection from direct interactions is not logical. eve (ccp) has always guarded the station as sanctuary from unwanted combat. sure you can still lose everything in trade or scams while docked, but never combat - period!trying to apply your view of wis mechanics to what is accepted undocked, will not work because it changes one of the basic combat mechanics of the game - station = no combat.as you said undocked = unsafe; therefore, docked = safe (not safer).i would like to see combat mechanics in station, but not all stations. faction warfare would be a good start."
11/25/2010,"no, this is eve. internet churches do not have to be respected unless you want to roleplay it that way. i'd see no reason why an internet church in a station should be any more sacrosanct than an internet church out of a station. to say nothing of the fact that the most likely ""church"" in eve would be the church of enslaving those dirty minmatar. i'm not understanding where the disconnect is coming from. again: stay docked up, play the market just like everybody does today. as for any other place where you can conduct ""interactions"" that is safe and not safer, eve doesn't currently have that other than chat channels, which you can use while docked up. so your claim that everybody requires that is nonsensical as it doesn't exist in eve currently outside of your hangar anyways. this makes no sense at all. ccp could not guarantee that the station was a ""sanctuary"" because you've never been able to step out of your pod into the station, and as i've stated and you've quoted, staying docked up will leave you 100% safe. again, this is nonsense. as you've never been able to step into a station before your claim is like saying that, up until now, driving cars around on planets in eve has been totally safe. yah, station = no combat because stations do not exist outside of your hangar. and as stated, you will still be 100% safe in your hangar, just like it ever was."
11/25/2010,"so what do you want to do inside stations that you can't already do in your ship whilst dock?if it isn't chasing wartargets down it is going to be some boring expansion, what are you personally wanting to do, get a haircut? buy some new clothes, if so the sims is thataway.incarna must bring some gameplay that you can't do whilst in a ship docked and to tell the truth the only gameplay that i can envisage is stuff like killing wartargets or sabotaging their ships some how, maybe new skills implemented for the latter, if this was implemented then incarna would be fabulous in my eyes but if it was just poker rooms/haircuts etc then it is a waste as you can do that already from your ship, well maybe not the haircuts but then again maybe opening a hairdressing salon could become a new form of griefing .so supported"
11/25/2010,"well open war or shooting in station in higher security area's wouldnt make sense, its what im saying, ok fight in lowsec station decks, but not highsec, even war. first off, wis should/would have civilians, and other things like you know, windows that may or may not be hit by stray fire,when you get down to the lower portions where the poor and homeless reside, people stop caring, oh yea deck 74 just depressurized, looks like we gotta clean that up after lunch, who cares.anyways, just sayingno fighting in .8 plus, even warother then that same rules as space is now.yes space barbie is pretty lame, but there are other ways to make it fun, it could be pve or pvp related. it be nice to kill outlaw pilots who dock in lowsec though."
11/25/2010,"so what you are saying is that you want absolutely no new content whilst you walk around stations, everything that you can do is possible from sitting in your ship already?my suggestion of ship sabotage would be cool, have some sort of skill so that war target when he undocks to play station games finds that he can't stop his ship and re approach station, now that would be worth it for incarna."

11/25/2010,"this idea crops up every month or two, and every time it's just as bad. i don't see this as adding anything positive to the game at all whatsoever - just an annoyance.general ship maintenance is already performed by the ship's crew (yes, ships do have crews) backstory-wise anyway. why should we suddenly have to pay extra isk? did they go on strike or something?how? nothing is being produced or being sold. it's just players ****ing away isk."
11/25/2010,"the problem?at the moment, you only receive the mail when you open up the insurance tab in a station, and not when the ship's insurance actually runs out.this means that if you insure one ship, and do not attempt to insure any ships after that, you will never receive a notification that your insurance has run out. the solution?it would be logical to change it so that you receive the mail when your insurance actually expires instead of when you open up the insurance tab.if you haven't insured any of your ships for a while, try opening your insurance tab & see how many expired insurance notifications you get. please support!"
11/25/2010,"fo shotie this into the eve calendar too, so we can see when our ships are losing insurance ^_^"
11/25/2010,"yes, definitely. a niggle that i've noticed on and off for too long."
11/25/2010,my pvp dessy lost its insurance a month ago?!/signed
11/25/2010,this would be nice.+1
11/25/2010,"ccp should add big rewards+ bounties for navy-members that manage to save pilots on stations or planets/belts attacked... they could instant-jump to location, with help of concord (concord could monitore that nobody tries to use situation) . pass it on to ccp...this could make game much more interesting for those on navy-fleets, not to mention reactions of those saved by the bell (like somebody in orca)."
11/25/2010,"point here is that would it really be realistic that any empire would let sansha roam free on their (high-sec) space withouth any response....they do it against other empires navys, so why not against sansha, that was, afterall, attacked by all empires together in story-line."
11/25/2010,"not sure if this came into right section even, but just wish ccp would get informed about this idea...just wish that sansha could not do anything they want in high-sec....concord should still be just monitoring player-player actions, but navy (perhaps through modifying it into separate ""sansha-fleets"") would be logigal opponent against them.i bet it would bring much fun for most (navy-)players, and increase amount of players willing to join the navy.on the otherhand, it could reduce frustation of many players, who loose their ships, and even could quit whole game because of it."
11/25/2010,"... you want to make players concord, and make sure anyone who gets concord'd dies even more?i'm sorry, this makes absolutely no sense to me."
11/25/2010,"no, i wanna make navy as navy. and game more fun for those in navy.what is navy there but to protect us from hostile empires and things like sansha???check story-line, all empires navy<U+FFFD>s fought together against sansha, and now they do nothing????i dont wanna make anybody concorded, except those who try to get benefit from sansha-attack (killing easy damaged ships, looting).but nobody should be concorded from attacking sansha-fleet, especially if defending those attacked by sansha.u got something wrong, read again."
11/25/2010,it might help if you typed better than a 3rd grader as far as english is concerned.and if english isn't your native language...should have thought of that before you proposed this idea.like it or not... he's having trouble understanding you... that's a fact.hell so am i.: o pnot supporting it because its obvious your not really sure either.
11/25/2010,"ain<U+FFFD>t this idea more important than if i spell it correctly?yes, i am finn, but i also understand that you can read and understand better than on 3rd grade level, right?come on, this can<U+FFFD>t be so complicated!it<U+FFFD>s just about how navy could bring balance on this coming sansha-incursion! otherwise its gonna be booring and even frustrating when you get into belts to mine or to planets collect stuff, and get your orca blown up regularly...concord can<U+FFFD>t and will not protect from sansha, so who would? navy!""its obvious u are not sure neither""?????yes, i am sure this is only way to keep high-sec still interesting and profitable (for newbies and navy f.ex.). where did you came up with that assumption?"
11/25/2010,"lets remind us again, this game is not about sansha-dominion.if it is, i resign this industrial-account and focus on 0.0 sec pvp-account.too bad that industrial account brings much isk for me to buy pvp-ships on other account, and much needed stuff from planets to my corp...if ccp won<U+FFFD>t come up some idea (like navy helping) in this sansha-issue, many pilots will quit.can<U+FFFD>t be so hard to understand, eventhough my english would not be perfect."
11/25/2010,"and, this is not about too much changes or complications on how to jump navy-fleet into sansha-attacked area.just as concord comes in seconds, in high-sec they could request assistance from ""navy sansha-fleet"" for somebody in problems, and fleet commander could make decision to jump with concord in seconds...."
11/25/2010,"your idea is worthless if no one can understand what ever the hell your saying.this isn't ""playskool"". this is assembly hall.take the time to spell and be clearly understandable and you might have a shot.otherwise your just looking like a fool.for crying out loud... you obviously don't give a crap because anyone who types ""u"" as opposed to ""you"" is obviously telling of ones mentality.what are you doing? texting this? don't you think you'd take a little more time and effort into your idea as opposed to just slapping it on like a paint bucket being dumped on the keyboard?are you a monkey hammering keys?because that is the impression your giving right now.and for the record... i still don't get what your talking about.i'm not asking for perfection... i have dyslexia and i'm not the best speller either.but at least i take the time to be clearly understood.ps: supporting your own idea with an alt is just as increasingly stupid and obvious."
11/25/2010,"omg.so that is what it is about???not to make game better, but to write ""you"" instead of ""u""???in game we both use shorter ""u"" i bet. and i am sure everybody here can understand it. only you seem to have problem with it!ok, forget my ""shortcuts"", just focus on message, not into messenger or his mistakes!ps. as i ""supported"" this idea with my alts, i did expect it to be obvious, as all my alts have similar names!.... jeeeeeesus...it was just expression about how much i myself support this, i really think it could save incursion.and if you cant understand what i try to say, i can definitely say its not about my spelling...."
11/25/2010,"btw, you noticed you wrote word ""text"" with lower-case letter after previous sentence? so don<U+FFFD>t come to me about using ""u"" instead of ""you""...and just as most of great writings and ideas, those are worthless only for those who themselves can<U+FFFD>t understand them...please explain what you don<U+FFFD>t understand, what in my writings you do not understand? i am happy to explain then with more details."
11/25/2010,"by ""navy"" do you mean the empire npcs (like federation navy) ?"
11/25/2010,"well, bot-navy would be much like concord... it would be much more interesting and fun if it would be navy from players that join it, in fact, it could increase amount of players joining navy very much...think about it:one fleet-division of navy, patrolling in case of sansha<U+FFFD>s, that just happens to be only one available (others are fighting already elsewhere against sansha<U+FFFD>s), and fleet commander gets call from concord to assist 2 orcas and 3 hulks...fleet commander has though choice... fleet is pretty much frigs, cruiser, bc<U+FFFD>s and couple battleships...but reward and bounty (from empire) rescuing those ships (and killing sansha<U+FFFD>s even) is huge...would he in few seconds take a risk and call in ts ""we jump!""..."
11/25/2010,"you what, this is unintelligible drivel, i haven't got an igloo what you are saying, are you having a giraffe at us?"
11/25/2010,"sorry, did not understand that ""giraffe"" (i am just humble soldier on my pvp account and hard-working on this industrial account)...just describing how it could be in incursion, as i have said, it would be incredibly stupid and ""not-fun-to-play-anymore"" if sansha get to kill anybody anywhere in high-sec withouth even any kind of possibility to strike back/defence by players...after loosing second top-fitted orca and/or hulk on planet or at belt in one week, guess i would quit and concentrate on civilization 5...only solution i can come up with is human-organized ""anti-sansha navy"", that could jump anywhere with concords help...and it would be so much fun, pretty close to some battles in 0.0 sec...but in this case even newbies in frigs could join, taking their (smaller) part from reward, loot and bounty...action! that is what this game needs more."
11/25/2010,"learning skills are being removed, according to dev blog, a great thing is happening, but i want to get this out before the fate that plex for remap had, ignor bitter vetsthings change,games evolvethis isnt eve build 000001this isnt patch 1.0learning skills need to be removed, it pushes noobs away, and no morons, they arnt optional, without them, it takes 25? 50? 75%? longer to train skills.without them, more people will play/thread"
11/25/2010,bitter vet checking in.i agree. new guys shouldn't have to train skills that do nothing but help them train other skills. when i started i kept putting off learning skills. there was always 'another' skill i had to train first.+1 to ccpwhat? i'm not that bitter
11/25/2010,"don't let cluesless nubs play the game!learning skills are being removed, according to dev blog, a great thing is happening, but i want to get this out before the fate that plex for remap had,ignor clueless nubssend them back to wow where they belong..."
11/25/2010,"op should perhaps look in a mirror before he calls other people ""bitter""."
11/25/2010,"i'm not the one who said dont do plex for remap cause it will ruin the game, because i didnt have it when it came outvets are the ones who ***** about things that are good, then a few months later most realize they were wrong,plex for remap was a good idea personally, isk for remap would have been better ( isk sink) but about 600 bitter vets *****ed, and now not happeningtrying to not let the same thing happen to this idea learning skills are stupid, and i'm glad they are being removed ( hopefully)"
11/25/2010,blarrrrg.
11/25/2010,1
11/25/2010,as someone who just started a new new alt 4 days ago im pretty happy about this. though it seems silly that im doing learning skills now and they will vanish in a few fews.
11/25/2010,i like it.
11/25/2010,"controlling how your ship takes damage, interesting tactics to utilizing it without actually increasing a ship's ehp.only problem i see is then it basically creates a small buffer hp that either tank type has to give its main tank a small respite. the only issue with that is that buffer is self regenerating on an armor tank, but a one shot buffer for shield tanks without armor rr. the net effect for that individual case is the same since while the shield tanker's shield is off its regenerating, but after that it's a (very) slight advantage to armor tank.interesting idea is supported though."
11/25/2010,"awesome idea, it'd be very fun to play with :)"
11/25/2010,i simply can not believe that jason edwards actually posted a reasonable proposal instead of low-grade trolls. the universe as we know it could fall apart.oh... btw... idea supported
11/25/2010,yes
11/25/2010,"interesting concept; however, i do not think ccp will want to program this one.i will support it because it makes for an interesting combat tactic."
11/25/2010,i like the idea. no idea if ccp will go with it though.
11/25/2010,"i love the idea, just not sure how it could implemented. maybe make the capacitor display into a pressable button to turn the shields on or off, but no timer i guess."
11/25/2010,i like the idea very much.i don't know how possible it is for ccp to implement though. i also think it would be near useless in a high lag situation.
11/25/2010,"finally a proper use for the tsm skill, apart from 'unlocking' tech 2 hardeners?edit: forgot support"
11/25/2010,"when you pay the subscription you pay to get access on all the game content not just a part of the game contentsubscription + item shop = is most outrageous thing one can hear, like spanish ppl say ""hacer de puta y poner la cama"""
11/25/2010,i want to vote no to this idea...no.
11/25/2010,anything that will get hybrids looked at and fixed. can't believe rockets are being fixed yet a turret weapon system used by two races of the game isn't even on he csm list.
11/25/2010,"i don't have all the time in the world to reply to your idiotic comments one by one so i'm just going to make a blanket statement that you are all idiots. i don't care about what initiatives have been put in place to do things... this is just a repeat of past initiatives that were supposed to do the same thing. the csm has failed to institute any measures to fix anything in the game. the game used to be good and the game design has progressively become worse and worse due to emo whinging on the forums by carebears. the csm has done nothing to stop the steady decline in the quality of eve it only serves as a mechanism to confuse the stupid who are in the majority that changes to the game are being implemented. this is exactly what is happening with the rocket 'fix'. i don't want to go into how the changes to rockets don't affect caldari ships to make them viable at pvp. what my proposal is is that we get rid of this forum where stupid people put their stupid ideas forward and influence the game to make it more stupid. ccp obviously don't play their fricken game, if they did they'd fix it. they obviously don't because it's been broken basically forever.- piracy is dead. there used to be piracy in eve.- a lot of caldari mechanics are broken and have been broken for a long time.- generally pvp shield tanking is broken. (t1 battleships specifically)- caldari weapon systems are broken in pvp.- some caldari ships were designed to fit webs/cap rechargers and have had their mid slots removed making them nonviable pvp platforms and in one case pve.- pvp is moving towards being completely consensual i.e. you have to sign up for faction warfare + there are a whole lot of dialogue boxes popping up warning you if you're going to perform an illegal act. additionally you can abandon wrecks to prevent flashy red people popping up around you. this was actually supported by the csm.- faction warfare introduced basically another anti-piracy policy in eve by introducing massive organization in low-sec that is something in the order of up to 6000 players to effectively prey on pirates. so they've introduced a predator.the csm has achieved nothing dissolve it. the only surprise i expect to receive in upcoming expansions is 'surprise eve just got worse'. they haven't achieved anything regarding real money items in eve online. dissolve the csm."
11/25/2010,"christ almighty, could you be any more mad?the csm are not developers. they are a communication channel between the players and the developers. they were always designed to be a communication channel. they've failed to institute measures? what the hell do you expect them to do, march over to iceland and uniformly kick ccp's management in the nads? any power they have, they only have because ccp grants it to them.your mistake is the mistake of many; you presume the csm are failures because you misinterpret their purpose. they're a communication channel, not a balance team. you want to see caldari fixed? you want to see pvp matter? how about you make a god damned proposal for those things? we're all open to ideas. we're just not going to go easy on you if those ideas turn out to be poorly thought out and self-serving.what i would be in favor of is making the csm more visible to the actual players of eve."
11/25/2010,"1/10, seen better trolls from goons and test.trying to hard there son, ya' got a draw it out. otherwise it becomes to obvious."
11/25/2010,"then it would appear that you are the minority here, and you can't argue against that point because you're the one who made it."
11/25/2010,this generates so many lols. i've bolded the most ironic part of his post.
11/25/2010,that makes sense on so many levels. not going to argue... i try not to seem 'troll' like (i'm actually not trolling) i'm just ****ed. i think a lot of people are ****ed.i'd like to complement you on your incorrect use of the word ironic. you have clearly shown that you are not an idiot and that i am wrong and stupid.
11/25/2010,"another stealth caldari are pants whine thread. the csm do there job, since this lot got voted in alot of things have been fixed or are being fixed that people have whined about for ages (rockets for example).as for the caldari and mid slots a. never fit cap rechargers for pvp b. i never seem to have a problem fitting webs to my caldari ships (cruiser and up). the problem with caldari ships is their hybrid ships dont get a damage bonus and hybrids are generally pants."
11/25/2010,i'd like to compliment you on how well you've managed to make your insulting remarks complement your own misuse of the english language.
11/25/2010,i do it with style.
11/25/2010,"but.. if you are a shrinking minority, doesn't that mean that, comparatively speaking, most people would not be ****ed?brb carebearing."
11/25/2010,qftbout damn time. nice to see your using your head.
11/25/2010,"ed: re-tar-dant: for the english impaired ccp/dons flameproof suit./sprays flame re-tar-dant everywhere./enters fallout style vault./braces for impact.problem with democracy is, that it is rule by the lowest common denominator. this is fact and a huge fallacy in the democratic process."
11/25/2010,i approve of this as a general statement.
11/25/2010,"i disagree, they managed to make ccp u-turn on a very good idea that would of promoted a more dynamic way to play the game."
11/25/2010,"i disagree, they killed the learnings. current csm, best csm."
11/25/2010,you can not dissolve the csm. they stay crunchy in milk.
11/25/2010,"irl black ops often have extraction ability. i suggest the ability for 0.0 alliances with sov to be able to drop a system upgrade and pos module that gives black ops ships the ability to jump portal to this module from anywhere in the eve universe(including wormspace??) this has 2 effects: the black ops ships actually tags along to hostile space and ships can get into bad situations and can escape. the caveat: cost of fuel will be much higher and there's a cooldown at pos module where you are unable to cloak, move or warp for a period of time, depending on ship size. quite the target."
11/25/2010,"so from you badly worded proposal i take it you want blops to be able to jump and portal all the way across the eve universe to a system upgrade/pos module that someone drops, ie instead of a covert cyno, this would make the blops the most powerful jump capable craft, you are not putting a cyno pilot at risk at all with your method and it reeks of personal agenda, although i would love to see a slight increase in the jump range of blops, this isn't the solution.not supported."
11/25/2010,"purpose:the purpose is really to just provide for a more dynamic experience, wherein a ""human"" element is brought more into the game by introducing petty mortals who do the work for you. essentially this element is already present, though it is hidden/unseen.background:crew consists of little insignificant mortals who don't count for much but still need to be cared for. the larger the ship, the larger the crew. while in station a crew doesn't require as much, while in space it will require more. in space a crew will require food and other supplies. in dock they can simply get these themselves. main proposal:if a ship is assembled it requires a crew. you need to hire a crew. so per time interval, a certain quantity of isk/supplies are paid/consumed to pay for crew. so if you have a titan or supercarrier, these costs will begin to mount up. no more simply buying the ship and you're done, now that awesomely powerful (debatable) ship is an isk sink that needs to perhaps now be used more often. when you buy a ship and assemble it you now have to buy a crew before you can leave the station. when you build a supercap you need to import a crew before it becomes operational. i would also like to see crews becoming more apart of the combat or mining experience. most interestingly, i would like to see crews gain experience. so that the longer your crew and you are together and they work together (basically the longer your ship stay intact) the more effective your ship will actually be. i made this up in like 10 minutes so i'm sure it could use reworking, but i wouls really like to see crews introduced."
11/25/2010,i have always had the comment that scientists / slaves / and other units should be able to be put in 'ships'/ and pos's to increase efficiency somewhere.imagin you use slaves on your ship and enter minmatar space where slaves are forbidden... - adds a dynamic to the game.or you have a pos - and if you put in 5 scientists - your labs run a bit % faster - or engineers - your pos uses a bit less fuel.they would become a commodity.
11/25/2010,"i have always trained the learning skills to a minimum of 5/4 on my accounts and have always hated it as it wasted basically a month of time before the toon can even start training on things that will make it a better pilot so maybe it will help if we look at it this way:keep the learning skills: causes new players to curse at eve, hate it and never play againremove them completely: makes 7 year old pilot a bit angry, why the hell should you care youve trained everything you wanted already htfu and they won't quit eve over itskills kept means a slower growth rate of players for eve, get rid of them and that rate increases creating larger fleets/corps/alliances and of course fun."
11/25/2010,"the arguments for the removal or modification of the learning skills are ridiculous. you all want them removed because they are a hindrance to training skills that make you a better pilot. that's exactly what training those skills do. they allow you to train at a faster rate making you a better pilot faster. in my opinion, you're all a bunch of whiners.the patience gained from training learning, social, leadership and trade is invaluable for the new pilot in later eve adventures. without that patience, gate camping and pvp roams would never get organized. the patience needed to do the same missions over and over would never develop. mining would never happen. eve is a game of patience. even a lone wolf ambusher needs patience going from belt to belt, system to system to find the right target."
11/25/2010,"i disagree wholeheartedly. games are meant to be fun, and the described activities are fun in themselves (yes, even mining, for some people, or bots, tmmv). spinning in station? not fun. the only thing that paying 15 dollars a month for spinning in station teaches is that you could be doing better with your 15 dollars.how do i know this? because i have heard it from numerous people who have quit the game, some i introduced, some i didn't, who came here looking for the stuff in the trailers and found... the learnings.recognizing terrible design, design that chases away new players and encourages and rewards tedium and boredom, doesn't make one a whiner. i would say that it would show more concern for the future of the game and about it in general than self serving bittervet postures from people that have trained all they cared to and want to keep their advantage forever, doing their utmost to make eve as boring and pointless as possible as to never have to compete with anyone or lose their imaginary edge over the barely growing wastelands of new eden.no, the whiners would be those closed to reason who stick to the way it is because they see it as a hindrance to new blood, and as such, good, in a perverse and nonsensical way. people who would make every facet of the game as tedious as possible. in short, you."
11/25/2010,so ccp finally started to listen all the wise words in this topic.

11/25/2010,not supported. worst change:(
11/25/2010,"too late! oh, only if you had said so before ccp made a blog about it!you could have stopped it! we would have learning skills forevermore!no but really, too late m8"
11/25/2010,all the bitter vets will cry now.
11/25/2010,"ccp has just handed bittervets our single largest bonus in the history of eve. not only have we benefited from learning skills for years now, but we also get millions of skillpoints that we can invest wherever we want now. it still would've been best not to institute this change, but for a change that was supposed to benefit new players ccp just granted an overwhelmingly huge bonus to older players. want racial dread or carrier to v? okay, that train will take you about 5 seconds. fc to v? well, almost. most bitter vets can go from leadership v to half way through fc v in, yep, five seconds once the boost goes through. ccp's just made vets even more overwhelmingly beyond new players in terms of sp's."
11/25/2010,im still confused by this and need a straight answer.1. will the removal of learning skills hurt the training time bonus that i currently have?2. if it dosent how is it being fixed i get that the points are being added to the attributes but im still confused to the reason of why.3. if the learning skills are being removed will there be another way to decrease the time that it takes to train a skill by increasing your base attributes with out a neural remap or implants?
11/25/2010,"you're not thinking it through, finn.yeah, vets get the sp's to apply now. but noobs are instantly equal to vets in training rate, whereas normally they would have to spend time (x months) to train up learning skills equal to the vets. and at the end of that x month time period, they will have applied to their non-learning skills the same sp that the vets are getting refunded. so it comes out in the wash.both sides win, they just win in slightly different ways: noobs train faster in the early months than they would have, which means they get to do more of the basic things faster. vets get to apply some sp now, and have more opportunities for training arbitrage.there are some edge cases where some people get slightly disadvantaged (and i am one of them, i set up a training plan just before ccp told csm they wanted to do this, and i stuck to it despite my inside knowledge), but overall it is a big win for everyone.yes, noobs will never catch up with vets. but they were never going to do that anyway. and in any case, the real reason for this change imho is making the game a bit more noob-friendly."
11/25/2010,better fix lag
11/25/2010,"not supported, bad idea.the eve is differ in case with other mmorpg's with it's freedom of choice, and training 'useless' learning with next faster, or instant training 'must-have' skills is a part of that freedom. and you are want to kill a part of soul of eve. i'll never agree with it. thanks to all for attention."
11/25/2010,not supported. worst change:(
11/25/2010,"yeah, someone should make a law! chillax, bro. the decision has been made, so take the money (well, the sp) and save your energy for a more important battle."
11/25/2010,big faila whole demension of eve removed forever especially for newbsmillions of free sp - only makes it more after u finished to distribute them (cause u got smth u wanted without effort)
11/25/2010,"big win! the whole demension consisted in spinning in station while paying monthly fees. a demension indeed.truly, a solution where everyone wins, noobs don't have to spin, bittervets are happy, everyone is happy.except for.. what do you call those things under bridges?... starts with a t or something.. its in the tip of my tongue."
11/25/2010,"even though i was in favour of keeping the learning skills, the fact that i get my months of training back in sp that i can flush somewhere else i am content with.to me- this got rid of a little element of the 'sandbox' where a player choses to skill or not to skill.but - with that said....fair to 99.9% of all people - everyone gets their training time back - lets start playing the game and stop beating this ""dead horse"" as it has been solved / patched.see you all in the game. cheers'"
11/25/2010,"no u!i mean, am too! in any case it does come out in the wash over time, but instantly all of us vets can invest points into noob ganking v where new pilots will still have to spend time training up ****ting up local to iv before they can skill up for tear extraction v. so new players get to train up a bit faster to match older player rates, but older players can train up almost any skill in the game to v, instantly. you are correct though, this change was largely instituted to help out new players and make their beginning game more friendly. i, for one, will do my part and skill up for some artie thrasher alts. oh, i'm chill. no argument here, just trying to figure out what i'm going to spend my noob-hammeringly-huge pool of free sp's on. maybe i'll just keep a pool of them to deal with potential t3 losses."
11/25/2010,"please for the sake of mind do not change the working system as long as it is not broken.if you ask the casual eve player why he likes eve he will mention the awesome skill system in front of all facts so why change it?it just makes no sense.people just don't get that eve is not about skills its about fun and you don't need the biggest ship to have that fun besides even if you train for that big ship straightaway you get it faster than if you train all learning skills at v before starting to play the game.the only proposition that would make the new system we already have, with the double sp till 1.6 mil, any better would be if the players that choose different ancestries get somelearning skills. like if you choose minmatar military soldier you get perc., adv. perc. and willpower skill at iv. rest you would have to train like all the rest. if you choose to play as amarr business then ofc you will get other starting learning skills at iv. maybe increase the double learn bonus cap to 1.6mil+the amount of sp you get in those learnings but that's not even necessary. that system would allow the players to train those skills of the profession they have chosen at the creation of character. later on they can change that spec. they got 2 remaps for that. the players that quit eve because of learning skills will be the players that quit eve as soon as they notice that there are skills in game that take over one month to train like carrier or freighter. or they will whine on the forums for as long as it takes to break ccp and remove the whole skill system.my english is not as good as i would like it to be but i hope someone will get my point. i did not train the learning skills at v i did that after i could fly a dominix with shieldtank and t2 med drones. the best solution for those learning skills would be that those people that tell all the newbies to train those at the beginning get banned or at least removed from forums because of giving bad advice."
11/25/2010,"why complicate? they have module already made, they only need to allow it to be used on ships. and let it remain high sloted, since we need marauders to be buffed and mid slot would be too much of a buff for armor tankers or nerf to shield tankers and whining minmatars.."
11/25/2010,"this comparison's been used many times, so if you're really easily irritable.... well, it's not my problem. xdbut this isn't world of warcraft. if you want things to be easier, go there. this game is designed a specific way for a reason. if you could just up and pull people in, it'd only benefit people like you -- who go ahead and would turn station games around for your own benefit, and pull people away from the station, reducing your difficulty/effort bumping people with your machariels -- and would benefit alliance warfare goers or casual lowsec/nullsec pvpers in no way what so ever and i'm not talking about practicality here, i'm talking about how fkd up pvp would be. you have webs, use them. there's a reason why your precious machariels exists, even if they weren't intended for bumping and there's also a reason why the rapier exists. use them in conjunction. don't go and ask for a universal solution to making pvp easier for your selfish needs. if pvp were that easy, again, world of warcraft influence. also, i'm sure ccp considered the idea of using tractor beams as the same mechanics seen in star trek and numerous other spaceship shows/movies. don't you think they would of implemented it by now if they thought it were a safe and practical mechanic? to sum this all up: because eve should be easy, amirite?after all, how long have tractor beams been around now??"
11/25/2010,except there should be. it was part of the rules they agreed to when the client first installs to a computer - to follow all policies. and the renaming only take effect when a person petitions it. which is where im going with this topic.
11/25/2010,i find the name gallion offensive and racistbut nice trolling
11/25/2010,grow up.
11/25/2010,are you like eve's version of mary whitehouse ? what about these names ?crackcrevicecleavagemelonsknobhungstackedsalamiweener ?
11/25/2010,"not sure if serious... of all the things to crusade against in this game, of all the things that suck or are plain broken, of all there is to fix you choose the word ""crotch""?i err.. confussd.but just for arguments sake, is there a list of terms someone may find offensive? i don't think such a sensitive topic as bans for offensive terms that seem inocuous to others based on a whole bunch of subjectivity are a good idea. i don't think this should be up to gm's as they are known to act based on their own beliefs and who knows what they find offensive."
11/25/2010,"his argument seems to be that instead of actually developing content, or cracking down on rmt, the gms and ccp should waste their time actively searching for supposedly bad names in character creation so the player-base won't have their delicate sensibilities offended by having to petition the individual cases. god forbid i should have to see a character with the word ""knockers"" in their name. my soul would be thoroughly corrupted if i had to actually petition it."
11/25/2010,">.> what? seriously im not targeting crotch. as the topic it was the reference for the topic. and as for referal to the inappropriate nothing can be said, so as such i stand by the fact having players named (sorry moderators) *****111 or vaginallips. is not by any means something that should be allowed to remain in eve. you guys are obviously still new to the world to understand the term teen and know the differnse of maturity. the devs/ccp of eve have not a hard time dealing with this manpower or automated. targeting me as the joke here is not the topic. so im gonna level with those who think that what im saying has any notions of delaying anything with eve's mechanical design. (yes glorified words) grow up. really, cause eve isnt a normal community its got plenty of smart players and demeaning this game that those who love it would rather have seen some improvements no matter how small."
11/25/2010,"i stand firm to the original tos, the naming policey is there. read that!crotch is fine, but the referance is not.point? this>>> excellence!"
11/25/2010,"the punishement is excessive for such a minor issue and since there is already a way to deal with such names, using any more of ccps time and effort on this seems like an unnecessary waste.not supported."
11/25/2010,yes your talking about petitioning them. so am i. its not minor it huge. u just wouldnt understand. oh and the punishment was there from the begining.
11/25/2010,"he is right, to a certain degree. when in communication with another player in eve it becomes unrated. but, it is technically rated teen and by virtue of that fact, the precious sensibilities of a teenager could be destroyed by looking at a profane name in local, without having agreed to any sort of comunicae.however, he is not even really arguing about profanity specifically because he states many times, quite fervantly, that he does not want to expand the catalog of the profanity filter. he is arguing that the petition system be changed in such a way so that he can press on with his crusade to protect the innocent and uphold the law (eula). now if we look at it from this standpoint we can ignore the profanity discussion altogether and focus on the real reason that he is the only one supporting his topic.plain and simple it will waste the gm's time. he seem to scoff at the very idea that this could actually eat up more time than he is willing to believe. in his original post he states ""i decided to petition in realizing it was literally pointless after-words"". he never stopped to question just why exactly it was pointless.i assure you gallion that the reason that it was pointless was because the gm's have to address literally thousands of petitions every day. there is a well defined reason that there is a cap on active petitions. because it takes up time. now i know that you believe that there are plenty of smart and capable people at ccp (and there are) but they are doing a lot of things all at once and they cannot prioritize naming conventions over game destabilization, even if those names in question breach the eula.you have stated unequivocally that raising the active petition limit will in no way hinder the process of eve's development, but what numbers do you have to support that claim. almost everyone here has elicited concerns over the gm's time management in regards to the amount of petitions they receive. why do you disregard that immediately? is it because you really believe that they could withstand any amount of work just because they are smart and capable? or is it that you believe all of us opposed to your idea are simply trolling it and attacking you?to be clear, i believe this to be a well thought out and cogent argument against your proposal, and in no way should it be construed as a troll or as an attack. i just think that there are ramifications beyond your well-intentioned idea that you have not or are unwilling to consider.on a side note however, i must ask, what did you find particularly offensive about the word crotch? i don't mean to pull this back into another vague discussion of syntax, rather the word itself. it does not actually refer to a part of the human anatomy, vulgar or otherwise. now, you have a crotch on your pants, and technically you have one between your legs, but the male and female reproductive organs are not a part of it.sorry everyone for the wall of text."
11/25/2010,"you have no problem to destroy a teenagers brandnew hulk in highsec by suicide gankers who buy plexes from real money to pay the losses but you have a problem with someone named crotch ?thats pathetic. no. not supported. if thats the only problem eve has, i can live with names like that.i seriously have way more problems to see native american or english player not being able to speak and write english grammar correctly, because i see my children (i have 3 of them playing eve) learning from them lots of mistakes and slappy language.but i cant change that. i know that i personally cannot write correct english (i am german), but i really would be more concerned about education of your poeple in your countries.my children can handle bad words, they just laugh about it.i am really more concerned about really bad behavior. stealing, scamming, lying, killing other people, destroying alliances... thats the nature of eve in general. and bad behaviour gets rewarded in eve. i think thats much bigger problem for children. they learn from that."
11/25/2010,"although i don't support the op, if you are going to start pointing out grammatical errors and spelling mistakes, i would look at your own writing first."
11/25/2010,"points made. and fer certain others.. still miss the topic. and my crusade isnt just mine there are others, and many of them don't have time for forums. petition work is part of their strive for excellence, and holding their rules is part that as well.they are fine with this. that is why there is a petition category and no change in naming policies."
11/25/2010,"she seems to address that with the ""i am german"" part, conceding her failure to be flawless."
11/25/2010,"i see you didn't reply to my comment about your name being offensive with it's obvious connotations but then you forget that inoffensive names in your eyes may have deeper connections than you first realise, the same applies to what you may find offensive in your language actually has different connections than you have the intelligence to work out.in other words, stop using your questionable morality to sensor other players names when you are doing it from a misguided platform of ignorance."
11/25/2010,no. but now your just attacking me. its sensibility & maturity. not morality.
11/25/2010,"whilst that is true, its still a bit of a cheap shot to point out someone else is grammar and spelling mistakes whilst making mistakes yourself. particularly when you cant be sure that the person your correcting is english as well."
11/25/2010,which im totaly fine with since that is your problem. but to put something past your ignorance. wrong topic.
11/25/2010,no its just just being racist.
11/25/2010,i was going to give you 10/10 (the adultery bit was classic) but then you posted twice in a row showing you are getting more worked up than the people you are trolling so dropped you to 6/10. good effort however and i am looking forward to your next attempt./
11/25/2010,"i firmly stand against any and all attempts of limiting what players call themselves. anyone who has a problem with a particular word should just grow up. it's a word after all. the original post is quite ridiculous considering the word crotch isn't even inappropriate. it doesn't matter if their are kids in this game, the majority of players are not. i have no problem letting someone name themselves whatever they wish or typing whatever they wish into a chat channel. words are merely a grouping of individual symbols, these symbols have been invented by human minds. human minds have invented the meaning behind them. words are not offensive, only little minds choose to take offense to them.though i do recognize that ccp is a private company and it is within their right to limit communications as they see fit."
11/25/2010,"i am attacking your ignorance, not you personally.if you can't see that, your own maturity comes into question.i see that you still haven't addressed my concerns that your own ingame name may be distressing to former neopets players."
11/25/2010,"ed: dimwitted typoed: mental complications filtered? wtf? so, to jump on you for your own statement. a while back, we tried to have a corp named ""death kitty"" this was deemed offensive due to the implication of the other cat word. the one with p, which we didn't even use. then we went through the trouble of trying the word in latin, ancient greek and even ancient egyptian. still blocked out due to reference to p-cat. pretty diligent i must admit. this is where we realized that the language written bears no impact on wether something can be seen as offensive.what i'm thinking here is that your name in my native language can be use as slang for an errected ""richard"". petition sent. (not really, but i do hope you catch my drift)"
11/25/2010,"near where i live, there is a restaurant named ""fuk yuen"" on a main thoroughfare ... i can just imagine someone like gallion going to the government office screaming to shut them down."
11/25/2010,"there is a place near me called****'s (word blanks, but its a man's crotch) halfway inits a restaurant if i remember rightanyways110 post1 supportplease don't let this ever happen."
11/25/2010,this will be dealt with
11/25/2010,"lol, i used to work with a guy named ****(richard) helmut. oh the poor innocent peers at his school! being corrupted every time roll was called. lol. and my grandma knows a guy named harold hoar. imagine being his mother."
11/25/2010,"they are to no use, flashing around in their colors, gagging players when they are trying to get help.im making it short, im a pilot with few words."
11/25/2010,bitter much?
11/25/2010,"he came into help, started demanding for a gm and being really obnoxious, swearing whilst doing so. when told by isd that he would have to petition, he replied that he had, the petition system didn't work, and he wanted a gm here now!... all whilst swearing and acting like a spoilt little brat.isd told him 2 more times he would have to petition, and to stay on topic, eventually he was booted, only to return an hour later and be booted again after 3 more warnings.emorage over a lost ship or something.sad"
11/25/2010,currently command ships often sit away from the fight and provide thier bonus.would be nice to see a range on these of a few hundred km and get a buff to thier hp so you actually see them on the field of combat
11/25/2010,"my command loki i stay in a safe spot, to actually be able to run 3 command links i sacrifice tank and so make it unprobable.my sliepnir is in the thick of action as is my claymore with 3 links fitted, yes i know some people safe up with these ships but they have a very good tank and should be in the thick of it, vultures, nighthawks, damnations are all in the thick of battle, the only command ships that need looking at are the gallente ones and that is mainly due to the terrible bonuses they field compared to the other races.so maybe it is just you but i have fought against many fleets with command ships in them and my corp fields them also.not supported."
11/25/2010,"simple enough when your in a cloaking gang even when you cloak you cant see any one else , which means that if you warp to say a gate good chance you might bump some one both of you get decloaked and generally at the time your in a ship thats got paper thin glass for armor.basic change, when in a fleet and you cloak your ship turns transparent yellow noting your cloaked but still being visible to your fleet. this will work for full cov-ops fleets as well as mixed fleets.additionally please try and keep posts constructive"
11/25/2010,cloaked ships are basically removed from the system (their coordinates are not send to anyone) to avoid client side hacks that would make them visible to others.
11/25/2010,"supported in principle.i suggest that the cloaked pilot have the following options, any of which may be turned on or off independently:* transmit position to direct commanders.* transmit position to all commanders.* transmit position to fleetmates with cloaking devices fitted and online.* transmit position to fleetmates who are actually cloaked.* transmit position to all squadmates.* transmit position to all wingmates.* transmit position to all fleetmates.if any one of the selected options applies, then that fleetmate can see the pilot while the pilot is on-grid and cloaked. these options have no effect if the cloaked pilot is not on-grid.leaving all options turned off replicates the current situation on tranquility: fleetmates can't see you on-grid unless you decloak."
11/25/2010,"well that can easily be solved by only transmitting it to fleet members.however while one might argue if cloaks do or dont need a nerf, is there anyone who honestly think that cloaks need a boost? (which this is)."
11/25/2010,"i was never sure if you could see cloaked fleet members. knowing that you can't, that's kind of off.supported, but you're probably going to get a lot of snark from others."
11/25/2010,"hows adding more skills to train helping new players? maybe if the 100% starter bonus was longer it would work. removing learning skills and granting a base 10 with the 20% for learning seems to be the best all round answer. sure those who have the full 6m sp in learning might feel abit put upon. but they'd get to put those sps else were. getting the time down for a new player to start flying a worthwhile mission/pvp boat keeps more people in the game, and is worth putting upon older players alittle."
11/25/2010,keep in mind the 'base 10' is an example. base attributes would be as they are now.
11/25/2010,"i dislike and do not support this option.learning skills are the first object lesson in teaching a new player the importance of training skills in the right order (and what an importance it is). their (extremely mild) complexity is very much in line with the rest of eve, as is the available choice to focus on or ignore specific attributes.training learning skills on a character is a significant investment in personal suffering (and for an early player making 1 million isk an hour, money); one that i'm sure nobody takes lightly, attaching them to their character. with your suggested changes, you'd have to be completely daft not to train learning to max immediately upon character creation.in addition, i dislike your math. a straight 100% bonus to skill attributes is extremely different than (+9)+10% or (+8)+8% or (+10)+10% like you should be training. with no additive component, this will skew skill training speeds pretty dramatically, as people will end up training skills they're specced for 2.5-3x faster than ones they are not, rather than a modest 1.7x or so.below paragraph edited for emphasis and clarification in redtl;dr people want to get rid of learning skills because they are painful to train. eve is about pain, it's an integral part of the game. it's a good pain, one that teaches you a lot about the game; if you can't deal with training learning, you're gonna hate training for ships. anyone who can't summon that small amount of patience and will to plan ahead is going to quit eventually anyway. getting rid of learning skills strongly strikes me as the first step down a terrible, slippery slope.i mean, what is the next logical step? probably something like turning all t1 frigates' and weapons' skill bonuses into inherent bonuses, enabling new players to jump right into the game without all that frustrating support, weapons, and spaceship command training. maybe this sounds a bit extreme; it is, but it's more or less the next bear in line."
11/25/2010,so you would have them remain as is? even after ccp indicated that won't happen ultimately?
11/25/2010,"lol some people still think ccp wants to keep learning skills when all else aside it makes new players less likely to subscribe. key point identification failure.trying to keep the ""i train a skill to train skills"" idea alive just isn't going to happen, even if it's reduced to one skill.edit - forgot to mention, lol @ slippery slope 2 posts above me."
11/25/2010,"lol yourself, sir.learning skills are not a major, or even a minor, deterrent to newly subscribing players. all of ccp's recent changes to the npe are geared towards solving this problem in another, more reasonable way. like i said before, if someone can't even deal with training 5 or 6 days of learning skills in the first couple weeks, they're not the kind of person who's gonna stay subscribed anyway.i mean, seriously, everyone posting in this thread trained learning skills. what makes you so sure that it makes everyone quit?your idea of the facts isn't the only valid thought process in the world, bro."
11/25/2010,"posting to confirm they make a lot of people quit. how do i know? because quite a few have told me so, and i was very close to quitting over them.if you don't think they are any sort of deterrent.. well, you probably didn't read through this thread, the other thread on learnings, the one in skill discussions, or the other numerous threads on the subject. you must also have missed the supports in general to remove them, change them, or plain kill them with fire.i did the npe content, the tutorials and all that, and the epic arc. didn't make the learnings suck any less, the spinning any more enjoyable, or the people that have quit over them, stay, so it is probably, in short, not the best at ""solving this problem"".by the way, the status quo is not a ""reasonable way"". but to be honest, i would think the ccp of :18 months: commited to getting new, fresh, happy people (worked, i am here!) over pleasing bittervets that bite and hate everything; would lead me to believe (and hope) that the learnings, and hopefully the skill system in general will be revamped.edit: oh lookie lookie, i was right. ccp does listen! if you quit for wow in rage over no learnings, can i has your isk?""learning skills will be removed on tuesday, december 14, 2010. you can read about the full changes in the latest blog from ccp greyscale."""
11/25/2010,"i'm caspardian, and i approve this message.topic.whatever."

11/25/2010,yay!
11/25/2010,"lolyour idea of the facts is the most invalid process in the world, bro.sucks to literally get a dev post the next day making you the absolutely most unsuccessful troll ever imo."
11/25/2010,"here's an actual link that works: linkageso now that this proposal is redundant, i have 6 million sp to plan to move to more fun locations."
11/25/2010,"are you mad? because it sounds like you're mad. belittle harder, if you dare.i'm fine with the new changes; it looks great to me. i just don't think it was ever as bad as you whiners made it out to be."
11/25/2010,"please for the sake of god do not change the working system as long as it is not broken.if you ask the casual eve player why he likes eve he will mention the awesome skill system in front of all facts so why change it?it just makes no sense.people just don't get that eve is not about skills its about fun and you don't need the biggest ship to have that fun besides even if you train for that big ship straightaway you get it faster than if you train all learning skills at v before starting to play the game.the only proposition that would make the new system we already have, with the double sp till 1.6 mil, any better would be if the players that choose different ancestries get somelearning skills. like if you choose minmatar military soldier you get perc., adv. perc. and willpower skill at iv. rest you would have to train like all the rest. if you choose to play as amarr business then ofc you will get other starting learning skills at iv. maybe increase the double learn bonus cap to 1.6mil+the amount of sp you get in those learnings but that's not even necessary. that system would allow the players to train those skills of the profession they have chosen at the creation of character. later on they can change that spec. they got 2 remaps for that. the players that quit eve because of learning skills will be the players that quit eve as soon as they notice that there are skills in game that take over one month to train like carrier or freighter. or they will whine on the forums for as long as it takes to break ccp and remove the whole skill system.my english is not as good as i would like it to be but i hope someone will get my point. i did not train the learning skills at v i did that after i could fly a dominix with shieldtank and t2 med drones. the best solution for those learning skills would be that those people that tell all the newbies to train those at the beginning get banned or at least removed from forums because of giving bad advice.i posted that in the other learning skill prop thread so ..."
11/25/2010,"you, sir, make a lot of sense.the whole learning debate is 90% whiners wanting the game to be easy, and wanting all skills to train 2x faster for free, and for implants to be removed so podding doesn't hurt, and insurance to cover ship modules, and for you to respawn as a ghost ship in your clone station and fly back to your wreck to resurrect your old equipment like corpsewalking in wow...while i think that ccp's changes to the learning system are fine (you pretty much train stuff at almost the same speed as before and the biggest difference is for new players), i do think the whole debate is blown way out of proportion.this, a million times this. that's my entire point."
11/25/2010,this matter has been resolved it took 6 days to responde the account was banned because they said that some one was hacking my account however they did not responde until after the ban was lifted this matter shuld be closed
11/25/2010,"i would've guessed you were banned for stupid, but okay."
11/25/2010,to what end do you have in mind when you played w/ legos?i understand your point but ccp indicated walking in stations would be optional.things like vendors that avoid transaction taxes may be one reason...illegal trade...mini-games....so they may come up with some reasons. i am simply of the opinion that i would like a sand box to make stuff. could maybe sell do dads that you make.build a great stripper stage and maybe someone else will buy it to stick in thier pad. maybe you build a cannon that shoots slaves at a wall...and you sell it to a corp.but i would also like to see the ability to create spaces.
11/25/2010,they have? that's the best news i've heard in a long time.wish they made waiting for them to develop it and get back to working on eve optional too.
11/25/2010,"this is not second life.if you like to build clothes, necklaces or waterfalls, go there."

11/25/2010,"eh, as long as it's really easy to look after them and you get witty remarks from the crew when you do things like spam clicking warp."
11/25/2010,"i didn't see this issue having been raised anywhere else, so i'll raise it now.i'm very glad to see that players are pushing for some extra npc interaction through the ccm's ship crew issue, and that ccp is bringing more npc combat to us through the upcoming incursion expansion.but i still feel that ccp could do better.as can be seen from the countless numbers of npc ships we capsuleers are able to make explode every day, there are a lot of npcs out there, looking for jobs and trying to make money. the thing is, it seems that they've already all been hired by either the four empires' security forces or by the pirate factions, because we capsuleers never seem to be able to fight alongside the guys--only shoot them.i propose that ccp implement a new system in which capsuleers are able to hire our own npcs to do the shooting for us. it adds a new level of realism to the game and will allow for some really really cool new tactics.obviously, the npcs we hire would have to both cost an exorbitant amount (to prevent abuse) and be extremely weak (to prevent abuse).still, i can't see why a corp shouldn't be able to hire an army of npc ships and tell them to guard a gate, or hop into another system and report the number of players in local, or blow up the enemies' station camp because we need to undock, dangit. it's even more fun for mission runners who want to run level 5's, but also really enjoy going solo.this could also be an interesting asset to sec corps who own sovereignty in nullsec systems. why is it that the empires can hire navies to guard their gates, but not capsuleers? we capsuleers seem to have no trouble finding people to work on our ships, so why not on other ships?perhaps, to add some ""customer loyalty,"" if i'm running a mission for the federation navy, i could get offered a discount on npcs i hire and use to run the mission with me.it's just a thought. if it's been raised before, please, let me know."

11/25/2010,eva.
11/25/2010,just like to say thanks to the csm who helped making this happen.woot!
11/25/2010,thanks alot csm for screwing with the vets
11/25/2010,with multiple chars at 90m+ sp i'm considering myself a vet and i approve of this change.
11/25/2010,"while i still think that the skills should not have been removed, the csm deserves major congratulations for making sure that as long as it was going to happen, that it happened well and fairly. not only are vets not screwed over, we're insanely boosted. my main account will have 4,743,765 sp to redistribute. my main alt will have 4,111,530 sp to redistribute. my secondary alts will also all have a bunch. honestly, the only way i'm at all put out by this is the fact that i just respeced for 1-year plans on all my characters and if i'd known that i could knock out that many sp's over night, i would've planned differently. as it is, my only actual concerns are whether or not i boost skills that i was planning for in the next year and then try to find other skills that use the same primary/secondary attribute, and if not which skills do i take. (dreads are soooo 2009, so i'm not sure that amarr dread v is in the cards, for example and i already have a nyx on my alt so i don't know if i need to skill for it on my main too, and...)"
11/25/2010,"i have it worse than you, finn. i made my yearly plan just before ccp told csm what they were going to do, and felt obligated to not act on the inside info (and save myself a day or two over the next year). so i respec'd. i'm too honest to be a good politician, i guess. my personal plan is to do sp arbitrage (train high-rate learning skills until the change, spend the points on stuff that would train the most slowly), and keep some points in my hip-pocket for doing things like training for the latest fotm ships."
11/25/2010,"yes well sorry i did misread that, but you cant really blame me, as it would seem pretty in line with what we can visibly see your effect being.you were elected by the player base to make a difference, yet for the most part any real changes that are suggested by players you play ccps advocate and try to make excuses for why we shouldnt expect changes such as those being suggested.im gonna give you a news flash, no one cares what csms real purpose is... the only reason we vote for any of you is because we think we can give you the power to make changes for our benefit.but apparently you cant even stop microtransactions... maybe you should take a page out of t'ambers book."
11/25/2010,"i look forward to your candidacy in the next csm election, dragon.all of us clueless and ineffective csms would really appreciate you getting elected to the council so you can show us how it's done."
11/25/2010,"are you a veteran character? recently traded a character in character bazzaar? then you might have noticed your corp history is incompletegranted not everyone is affected by this and i'm sure it's a very low priority for ccp (or not even that). but as outstanding issues go this must be about the longest running. the root of the problem, characters started or joined corps before the records began (over 7 yrs ago), then later changing corp to find out their corp history has been deleted. as happened to me. i have a 3 day corp history, when in fact the character was ceo from pretty much the first day (until recently)have you experienced this? anything similar? lets hear about it"
11/25/2010,"did you bugreport this? not saying it'd get fixed anytime soon, but unless it's bug reported we unfortunately can't assume ccp is even aware of this."
11/25/2010,"this thing was discussed some years ago (in the test server forum if i recall correctly) so ccp is aware of this, or at least some dev was commenting in the discussion. the topic of the thread was that some people was thinking it was an exploit as there was people with a very short history on a old character.from what i recall there was no intention of recovering the old data."
11/25/2010,"hi all, venkul mul is absolutely correct. ccp is aware of this, but they seem to be unable to do anything about it. here's a snippet from a recent conversations: i'd like to thank the nice gm's for their support and assistance but surely that must be another way? any other character viewing the corp history wont be able to see the d.o.b, so how do they know? anybody have any (nice, constructive) suggestions or comments"
11/26/2010,how's the bug/feature/idea-tracker coming along?
11/26/2010,"updated nov 26th*removed*=====rocketslearning skills andplex for neural remap =====as ccp has stated those changes are being, or are deployed.the list will be updated again after the results of the nov prioritization has been tallied up. thank you for your continued patience."
11/26/2010,"at the least, a change of terminology is in order. instead of insurance, call it a salvage contract; in exchange for an the initial payment, you're guaranteed a share of the value of recovered materials, and an npc corporation is guaranteed rights to what's left of a wreck after capsuleers pick it over. i'm sure there's enough minerals left in a wreck even after capsuleers salvage it for npc salvage operations to be viable.as far as getting rid of subsidized ganking, i've dabbled in ganking for killmails, and i'm in favor of it. even a battleship isn't expensive enough for this to significantly affect highsec piracy, but it does give a bit more of a bite to it. and thrashers are always cheap, fully insured or not.+edit: also, i'd suggest that insurance not be voided for someone who loses a ship to concord, but didn't kill anything and has no other negative security events for a month or so, to cover those 'wait, that wasn't a rat!' moments.also also, the pirate frigate idea is interesting. it would be fairly balanced if it treats them as outlaws but suppresses gccs and security penalties for attacks using t1 frigates."
11/26/2010,no
11/26/2010,quote until someone responds...
11/26/2010,nonot even clothes/visual items are acceptable. why? because for some people the social aspect of the game is gameplay.look at star trek online from cryptic.. they are dlc heavy like no tomorrow.. do you *really* want to turn eve into that stagnant crap? no.
11/26/2010,"noi will never pay for micro transactions, it looks like a cheap way to earn money and i don't think ccp would be so stupid. (hope so)"
11/26/2010,if they fix blaster by this time next year i would be shocked. it needs to happen but it seams no one cares.
11/26/2010,"wow, this is an old thread. blaster have been broken for so long, and they need improvements. same with railguns. they eat your powergrid and use all your cap.in fact, gallente ships will need a huge overhaul. slow ships + close range blasters = ccp can't just increase the optimal, tracking and dps a little bit. what use are blasters if another other ship can kite you? they don't even do much dps.... especially considering that the shield-tanking minmatar ships can slap on 3 gyrostablisers and 2 tracking enhancers, which give a huge boost to range.quick megathron fitted:neutron blaster iis, antimatterwebscrammwdtungsten x4eanm x2dcu x2=492dps, 4.5+13km range. 167k ehp. 797m/squick maelstrom fitted:800mm repeating arties, empdisruptormwdinvuln large shield extenders x3=763dps, 3.5+31km range. 106k ehp. 835m/sdamage at 5km: mega(499dps) mael(773dps)damage at 10km: mega(405dps) mael(739dps)damage at 15km: mega(252dps) mael(675dps)damage at 20km: mega(124dps) mael(585dps)damage at 25km: mega(55dps) mael(484dps)"
11/26/2010,"railguns are unusable right now. least alpha, least dps, worst capacitor, terrible clip size, awful tracking, all for what? slightly better optimal? wtf.compare to:artillery: awesome alpha, good dps, good range, excellent falloff, no cap use.lasers: good alpha, excellent dps, excellent range, excellent tracking, instant ammo change.railguns are worthless right now for every ship that is designed to use them (and in general too).railguns use just as much cap as lasers yet are inferior in every single way. make them high dps, keep low alpha, long ranged, high cap use. that would be at least make them unique in comparison."
11/26/2010,"i think it's a great idea but here is another suggestion to solve the issue for everyone give the carriers an extra high slot that can use something called a repair bomb. in the field of battle you can repair your drones fighters. you should send them to assist your carrier to put them in orbit around them that will repair shield, armor and structure as long as the drones are not fighting and yourself as well the repair will repair to a max of 10 k and everyone can rep they're drones with it. this mod can repair only drones not ships or other devices only drones of all races and types.with this it gives another skill to train which can boost your range as it goes and also boost the repair amount every levelgives a new bpo to the game ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ repair bomb ^^^^^^^^^^^^^"
11/26/2010,"i'm hesitant about this.the name for a gun in the old west was an ""equalizer"". it didn't matter if you were brilliant or incredibly puny; if you put your gun to the back of somebody's face and pulled the trigger, they were dead.imagine assassin alts. literally, alts designed to undock in stations with a gun, make their way to whatever target, and kill them. only takes one shot to the head, after all. in space if you're fast and attentive or even just durable, you can get out of a bad suicide gank. it's somewhat harder to get out of involuntary lobotomies; by the time they're recognized as a threat, you're already dead.you could impose restrictions on this to make assassination attempts harder, but you're going to end up with a lot of pretty bizarre special case code if you do. further more, if every time you go into a station you risk losing your implants, that's going to keep a lot of people out of stations. then you end up with them being even more deserted than before. unless you make it mandatory. and that way lies madness, my friend.also, fictionally, it doesn't make much sense; the security in stations is likely to be pretty damned tight. if america is paranoid as it is after a few buildings get planebombed, imagine how edgy jita's security force must be. they probably barely let you into the station without a colonoscopy.i understand the idea, but in practice, it's just stupidly open to exploitation, and i don't think you could really rectify that without mutilating the idea.sorry, finn."
11/26/2010,"once incarna comes out, i'll be ready in the station with my pistol. it will be fun roaming around a 0.0 station looking for unwanted neuts.or, how about these suggestion in addition to the op's?1. jettisoning the dead neut's corpse out the airlock in 0.0. - it would be fun seeing that.2. bumping a player you don't like in order to instigate a legal fight in jita. - just like high-sec ship aggro. imagine, you are walking along the food court and you spot someone you recognized, someone who you have plenty of beef with. you approach the person using ""target mode"" in the crowd and you select the option to shoulder bump him/her. you have started a 1-minute aggression timer with the person. if the person you bumped doesn't throw the first punch (you can't use guns in high-sec stations unless your target is an outlaw - be careful not to shoot the crowd) by the time the 1-minute is up, then you can go about your business. but if he/she does throw the first punch, then an all-out fist fight ensues. the crowd around you makes a big circle and everyone starts placing bets on who will win... you or the target. the winner walks away. the loser is taken to the medical bay and finds him/herself eating lunch through a straw. in low-sec, guns could be option if you can keep it within the empty hallways.3. station siege. if the station comes out of reinforcement after being sieged, then the enemy fleet can board the station and take it over from the inside. the enemy fleet can choose to either destroy the station, or take it. if they decide to take it by boarding it, then the station is invulnerable to the ships outside, however, ships can still enter it. i would recommend a single objective such as a centralized control room and/or power generators deep within the station while the owning alliance has setup a defense at the control room's entrance. enemy pilots will not be able to access the crew quarters without gaining control of the centralized control room. even then, they have to secure the power generators as well in order to maintain power to the control room.edit:i almost forgot one other suggestion. in the event than a armed incursion of the station does start, all crew quarters will be locked down. if you're in the crew quarters at the time of the lock down, you could try to make your way to the control room via the ventilation shafts (access to these vents should be restricted to the alliance owning the station."
11/26/2010,"truth be told, i don't think that being able to screw with someone's ship itself while they're docked would be a good mechanic, any more than you should be able to screw with someone in a station while you're undocked. having a ship in your hangar should remain as is, imo. docking games can, properly, be handled with changes to space-based game mechanics anyways. that's not to say that the dynamics of walking around wouldn't be different from flying around in space. obviously it's a bit easier to gtfo if you can go to warp. but that's why we're primarily pod pilots and not station jockeys. it's the same risk anybody takes when they undock. and if they don't want to take that risk, they can stay in their hangar, after all, just like now. besides, this is eve. that getting out of your hangar includes the risk of destruction is nothing new, and people who won't play the game because of it aren't long for eve anyways. tbh, a lot of eve's fictional bits don't make sense. concord will exterminate you almost instantly if you're running a mission with a buddy and remote repping him and you accidentally hit him once with one gun... but rats in a belt can tear you to pieces while concord does nothing, at all. and it can be pretty easily retconned as well. ""all of the four great empires believe that gun ownership is a fundamental right and blah blah blah blah, blah."""
11/26/2010,"+1, although that might incur the risk of eve being viewed as a ""mainly pvp game"" again like it used to be. do we really, really want that...?"

11/26/2010,"anyway, great idea :)"
11/26/2010,"bad idea, stations when we are allowed to walk around should be gun free, safe zones. i like they idea of sitting in a bar watching and smacking your target and following them out. but having a bunch of idiots running around shooting anyone they want is a bad idea. stations are safe spots and should remain so. i wouldn't mind them having a bloody window to the undock though, and/or in player owned stations a secondary uncampable by ******* undock. cause nothing worse then undocking only to find some **** in his carrier sensor boosting and repping someone to insta kill you. these guys normal smack talk alot and never leave the safety of the undock. i assume they lack ***** size as well cause bragging about station gaming is about the best it gets for those people."
11/26/2010,"i want incarna to be as unforgiving and grief-able as possible. fully supported.(although i'm not too keen on the fps analogy, i'd much prefer a traditional mmo style, 3rd person perspective set up)"
11/26/2010,"i'd assume that it'd be easiest to use the wod interface, which i'd guess would take the third person perspective. but if that was too hard i'd settle for fps style stuff. as long as they didn't make it like the matrix mmo,it'd be okay. that's exactly how 100% of the game is currently while you're undocked. if you want to smack without repercussions, you've still got local. but no, they're not. your hangar is safe and should remain so. but not one player in the game's history has ever stepped out of their pod and into the actual station. right now, they simply don't exist as anything other than an idea. it's a bit like saying that the grand concert halls of caldari prime have always been completely safe. they have been for the exact same reason that stations have always been completely safe... nobody's ever been in either."
11/26/2010,but i was hoping to run a bar in lowsec station when you could move around their. how can i do that if everyones running around killing each other. somewhere has to be a safe zone. i guess i could just hang a no guns allowed sign at the door. maybe get the sansha to watch the door.
11/26/2010,no thanks.i don't fancy listening to you lot *****ing like a bunch of whiny teenagers when the insides of stations turnout to be as empty as lowsec because you can't help shooting everyone that walks past.not supporting due to potential for massive whiny *****iness.
11/26/2010,there are ways...iow: don't allow people to shoot other people in stations because people may shoot other people in stations and and then people won't be able to shoot other people in stations.
11/26/2010,"iow: get people to quit their *****ing about how empty lowsec is, and i'll change my mind. i have a low tolerance for ""wahhh i don't like these consequences even though they're our fault"".edit:that said, i do really like your sig, finn."
11/26/2010,i support the concept as i really don't want wis to become just utterly redundant and from what ccp allowed to get through it looks just like it will i think that high sec station should really be close to save as in you can kill someone if you spend several days an a couple hundred million on a gun that you can fire undetected and then get turned into swiss cheese by the concord soldiers guard bots etc so the should be no salvaging of implants in at least 0.8+ below you should be able to (again with a lot of expense) fool the security to an extend that you can assassinate somebody get in your ship and then gtfo with navy aggression then you should be able to dock at another station of a different corp and wait said timer out if its the same corp's station you will get hunted by the guards there and probably killed or will not even get rights to dock in low sec you should be able to kill someone take his head to salvage and get shot at by the occasional security gun gtfo from the station and wait out your timer on another or suchnull sec should be total anarchy at least on pirate stations for outposts you the owner should be able to hire npc mercs to defend against intruders those of curse would not shoot people of the owners alliance and could be equipped with better weapons armor shields and other tools (on a side note i just got the idea to hook dust into eve by being able to sent dust mercs into an enemy station to take it over or just destroy something shield generators so it can be taken over from the outside more easily etc )i don't think i have to say much about weapons and tools as there really should not be any discussion what those should be well maybe one thing...i think it would be awesome if you could break into ones hangar and steal something but that imho should be possible to defend against for a 99% if you get a certain level of hangar security which would of curse be very expensive and could maybe be breatched in null sec over a course of several hours letting your hacking tool work while you play cards with your corp mate and of course the owner would get a message like 'hey dude your hangar is being hacked go and do something!'i do have enough ideas for another 20 post but sadly i'm pretty lazy about writing so...
11/26/2010,"the necessity for a feature so that space barbie actually has any real features isn't effected by whether or not people will complain about it. just ignore them if they complain. besides, people already undock in highsec despite the fact that they could be ganked any moment. highsec decks on a station would be no different. and thanks, i need to edit it since the size limit is freakin' small and when i reduced it i was too lazy to resize the text on the bottom. can't read that **** without my glasses on. can barely read it with 'em."
11/26/2010,"and low sec is dead.there's three reasons with won't work:first, wardec are between you and concord, but these stations are not necessarily controlled by concord. this means even if you have a valid war between your corp and corp b, it's not likely to be honored in any station. secondly, there's no 'real' reason for 'suicide ganks' to happen in stations. unless you expect pod pilots to walk around with tobien's modified top hats on their heads or something, there's no benefit. you talk about implants, but implants, like rigs, are intended to be isk sinks where they're continually removed from the market whenever used. finally, the last thing eve needs is more griefing. further, i suspect incarna is intended to do three things:1) it allows ccp to show off their carbon character creator.2) create a ""real"" connection with one's character-- one of the complaints i hear from new or turned off players is that they feel no real connection to their character, since the only 'representation' of him or her is a small image in the left hand corner or in the chat window.3) provide new areas to bother expand into in terms of gameplay (like gambling) and bring eve's lore more to a forefront. it's one thing to talk about amarrian slaves, it's another to see them 'in person'.i'm not saying that their shouldn't be combat ever, but that combat is likely going to take the form of dust, not incarna."
11/26/2010,"i support enabling physical combat between capsuleers, but the deliberate lack of security measures as you propose will make incarna not so desirable as a whole.the whole point of ganking in stations is to have fun by ganking real, alive capsuleer targets, not just some unimportant nurtura foundation deck 17-12 guard #15437. this means a steady influx of voluntarily capsuleer meatbag targets is required to make the whole gis run smoothly. think of the current situation of lowsec; since there's nothing special that only lowsec can offer, and the risk for operating within such place is comparable to living in hostile 0.0, any lowsec region that is not a faction warfare zone or a l5 mission hub is barely populated. of course, shooting other pirates / pirate gangs itself is a lot of fun, but the whole concept of piracy, ransoming and plundering does not work very well right now because of the distinct lack of unarmed, unsuspecting and innocent targets. simply put, i don't want to be an innocent target for a crappy paycheck, so the rewards have to be bigger or something completely unique enough to make me risk myself as a target.therefore, at least two systematic encouragement for voluntary self-victimization has to be established to supply the coveted targets.1. unique experiences and/or compensation via station-only items & systems for potential meatbag targets (especially in lawless decks).2. reasonable safety inside station areas. (partially) preventative law inforcement and personal defence gear. degree of prevention can be configurable at the user's will (hirable body guards and duplicates, private security grids and detection gear in taverns, directional forcefields that can cover your back while you play poker or shake hands with high level officials, etc.) to add immersion to the in-game world.preventative security measures also have a side effect; it makes the whole ganking process much more challenging and engaging than ""lock target -> scan cargo -> shoot -> get blown up -> scoop loot with alt-> rinse and repeat."" bypassing security measures itself is comparable to solving complex puzzles(at least according to the chronicles and novels), so it adds another layer of gameplay element that rewards the intelligent, patient and persistent users. the kind of stuff ccp envisions as being eve-ish, i think.the empyrean age and burning life novels provide some insights toward how the inhabitants of stations(especially those in lawless areas) protect themselves with whatever resources they have, and most importantly, the reason why those inhabitants got there and lived there in the first place. i hope these references help you improve your idea of gis so that one day i may actually see gis going live in tq (and become the game of true black ops that will make cod: black ops a crybaby).once again, i support your idea. fly reckless.edit: wording and some more ideas."
11/26/2010,"my personal issue isn't that i'm not getting combat *right now* in incarna. i understand it's supposed to be phased integration and whatnot. i haven't seen all the dev posts, but i'm hoping the intent has been ""incarna will not come with combat activated, but it will be something we will be trying to get in hard after that."" that being said, the impression i've gotten is along the lines of it isn't even on the long term agenda. this is a serious consideration to the overall feel of the game. i really don't think ccp will keep combat out of stations forever, but until i hear otherwise i'm going to have nightmares of telling my friends ""we have avatars now! they don't really do much and can't even fight, but we have them!"""
11/26/2010,"if i get the op right, i believe he is suggesting that the security level of the station doesnt have to equal that of the system. as well, each station can have multiple decks/locations of varying security level. with this idea, you could still set up a bar or shop in a station in a station located in 0.1 sec space, but be on the only deck of the station that happens to be 0.5.or perhaps you can hire guards, which would effectively create a ""high sec bubble"" around your shop or bar. of course, as the op illustrated, and i agree 100%, all security needs to be punitive, not preventative, in order to keep with the philosophy of eve."
11/26/2010,"station security isn't tsa 'underwear bomber got through' level of security... we're talking about gods who hold enough isk to buy several planets and more.a spoon or even a well camouflaged weapon will be easily detected by the high-resolution scanners installed in every single wall of the restricted capsuleer area, and automated defenses ready to take out any threat. and low/null-sec? those people know even better the lengths one must go to ensure security for the roaming gods.unless you move into the commoner's area there's really no straight-forward way of killing someone, and even if there was it would be a suicide op. one that might see you sanctioned by concord in ways ship combat wouldn't."
11/26/2010,"just because its not what you want doesnt mean its bad.""space barbie"" as you call it can bring many things to eve. the point is, character creation, people want to have an avatar, not a picture and hey look at my badass ship that doesnt have a pilot.gambling, drinking, player owned shops? and other goodies can be implemented.even station/planet/ outpost combatsome of your ideas are ok, but basically your a moron, which is why it wont happen, pvp because i'm a 1337sauce wardecing alliance is just plain stupid.what would be fun are like what i said,drug running, shady deals, gangs in the slums even if its pve related it could bring much more to evealso think about this, suicide ganking in station would be lock boomb headshot, a trial could do it, combat if any would prolly be pve only."
11/26/2010,"no, seriously, can we please actually get it deployed first? then we can worry about stuff like this."
11/26/2010,"capsuleers are pilots, not soldiers. they're not only pilots, but ridiculously wealthy pilots so there's absolutely no reason a capsuleer wouldn't have a heavily armed escort... that's if the station isn't safe.but stations should be safe. stations are owned by corporations and they would be incredibly stupid to allow capsuleers to fight each others all the time. because if that becomes a game mechanic then it will happen all the damn time. ridiculous.eve is a harsh place blah blah blah. it's so harsh that every single aspect of the game must be open for greifing. really, i can't wait for the day when ccp will delete x number of accounts per day, just to prove how harsh eve is. can't wait to brag about how awesome i am for playing a game where even your account is not safe. i'm already having an e-boner.i don't think wis will ever have combat and i don't believe eve needs station combat at all. there's enough drama about balance issues and broken game mechanics already, we don't need another the game inside the game.as far as i know, wis is a social thing first and foremost. don't like it? then stay in your damn capsule and keep using the good old chat. the new character creation tool is amazing and having a complete avatar from head to toe is nice, even if i don't intend to ""socialize"" with it <U+FFFD> la second life.what i would like to see in wis is interactions with important npcs to enhance the pve experience. maybe having a dialogue system <U+FFFD> la mass effect, but that would be rather ambitious. but combat? hell no. we don't need that, there's enough pew pew in this game."
11/26/2010,"my a moron is the cause? damn, i will totally call in my b or c morons instead.calling someone a moron only works if you can at least spell the word ""you're"". just saying. and it's pvp because we're playing eve online. nor is it because i don't like it but because it diverges from the dynamic of eve online. and please, i've stated several times that a bullet to the head wouldn't have to be fatal on anything but an 'untanked' char. it'll be deployed soon. all that needs to happen for this proposal is that ccp commits to introducing gis at some point. it's not a demand for the next expansion to have it, just for some expansion to have it. exactly. just for argument, let's say every station has 10 decks. in highsec you'll probably see most stations with 7 highsec decks, 2 lowsec decks and one nullsec deck, and if you travel out to a 0.1 (space) security system you might see 1 highsec deck, 6 lowsec decks and 3 nullsec decks. or whatever. exactly. that's why i want a commitment to iterate. maybe it takes a year after wis goes live, maybe it takes five (but i hope not). but in either case, i'd like ccp to say ""yah, eventually there will definitely be combat in stations in one form or another."" not necessarily. right now we're just dealing with the concept that combat should happen and wis should be iterated upon to that end. the specifics of gank versus tank can be hammered out in the design/testing phases. there's nothing that says, for example, that a pilot wearing powered armor and a massive personal shield can be one-shotted by any weapon, at all. or that pilots won't have a ""displacer device"" that makes their actual position look six feet off their actual location until their hologram is shot and discovered to be fake. or that headshot damage will actually be counted any differently than shooting someone in a foot just like you can't actually target subsystems in ships now and all damage is simply applied to general shield/armor/structure hp pools. or...and, sure, there should be enough compelling content in stations that there's a reason to undock and risk attack. 1. ccp controls the fiction, they can write/rewrite it easily enough. ""turns out that concord handles all station security. who knew, eh, eh?""2. again, nothing specific even's been designed let alone playtasted yet. maybe a pilot with a personal shield in a station can't be one-shotted by anything lighter than a six foot long .50 cal sniper rifle or a plasma cannon, and one would think they're not exactly inconspicuous. 3. as my proposal is for pvp and not griefing, which is illegal under the eula anyways, i'm not sure what your point is. the last thing eve needs is actually a pvp free zone"
11/26/2010,agree with this gentleman.
11/26/2010,"definitly support.having the ability to gank in stations takes nothing away from what we currently have (if your docked in a hostile station, you still can do everything from the hanger), and having decks of different security status regardless of system security means that lowsec stations wont be empty (in fact may even be more busy, since lowsec and null entities have less need to dec each other).personally, i would find an fps combat system more amusing than a 'lock on and hit' mmo style combat system, purely because of the potential comedy of hitting random passers-by and getting concorded, even if you were aiming for a legitimate wartarget (would give folks the chance to hide in the crowd).i would be inclined to suggest giving a second tier to wardecs - the standard wardec only covers ship-to-ship combat in concord sanctioned space, while a second type of wardec (maybe 10x the price) would permit combat in station as well (basically, you are paying off not only concord, but faction police too). if you wanted to get fiddly, you could seperate faction areas with the dec as well (for example, could dec the targets only within caldari stations but not extend it to amarr, or dec someone within only empire stations, leaving them safe in pirate faction ones).however its done though, a combat-less station experience just flies in the face of everything eve is, and we need a commitment that combat will be implementated in one way or another at some point."
11/26/2010,"first off, you don't understand what ambulation is on a technical level.second, you're a spaceship pilot. when you're in a station, you are in a country's territory. you don't have your licence to do as you please anymore.so if you are able to commit murder in a station, you should be punished by the owning corp as well. this means that depending on the corp politics, the punition could be as pathetic as a 1% buy tax incease in a station (angel), to being unallowed to dock in any of the corp's station and have a bounty put on your head (any empire navy).then, maybe, you can start talking about the possibility of blowing brains out.also, i'm all for some eventual out-of-pod action, but i still think you're just a ****** troll with some serious issues.i think you should just play dust."
11/26/2010,why waste so much time on something that is just an eye-candy marketing ploy?
11/26/2010,"""the last thing eve needs is actually a pvp free zone""oh yeah sure, we can't have people safely grinding level 4 missions with their pimped out marauders inside stations. wait, you can't."
11/26/2010,"so, the general argument of the 'no' side is along the lines of: pvp is icky, the definitive scifi universe has safe zones (not safer, _safe_), ""it mite beunbalanced and i suck at gamez!"", and supporters should go play dust.wish i could support again -.-signed, someone who doesn't need a magical safe zone, thinks if you're in station ship spinning a smart agent should be able to blow up your pod while you look at the interface, and knows that would make him vulnerable to some extent at all times as well. if you want to be safe, log the expletive out and go play farmville."
11/26/2010,"and i love when people recite lore when they obviously haven't even read one of the actual published novels. go read the burning age and say you are always immune from someone who wants you dead, or worse."
11/26/2010,"truthfully, i thought that this would be a very, very easy sell. i mean more high quality pvp in eve with the type of avatars that so many people seem to want. pvp, in eve, is evidently objectionable to some people. it's a little bit like going skiing and finding some people protesting against snow. ah well. as for lore, even if some of it didn't fit with this proposal (but it does), ccp can always rewrite it. it's their story after all, so that argument seems weird. it'd be like people protesting before red moon rising that players clearly had no capital ships in the lore, so capital ships shouldn't be give to the playerbase (in before ""zomg i hate motherships so you are wrong!!!"")if tomorrow ccp wanted to rewrite it so that concord ships were really crewed by 8 foot tall giant rabbits, then hippity hoppity. so that it's not just a bit of eye-candy.thank you for your intelligent and thought provoking contribution."
11/26/2010,"this made me laugh.i am only supporting this silly proposal if we go all the way realistic. that is, if you get ""concorded"", instead of being blown up you are simply incarcerated. i want players who try in engage in station ganking to be locked up in a brig for a few weeks without outside data access. that is, no access to industry, market or pi menus, no chat, no mail, no corp functions, no fittings, not even ship spinning. just an icon or avatar in a cell with a countdown until you are released from prison."

11/26/2010,"the more value of stuff player have in eve the longer his or hers password is, sometimes its so long and tricky that you need written reminder on what is it... but there are also exceptions.password is the only thing which is implemented as precaution against accounts hacks.i propose another one,easy to implement, ccp dudes not need to work hard to implement it, and it would make many, many players happy.before i start with explanations, i believe that this shouldn't be mandatory option for all players, you could ""attach pin"" or not.if you do it will limit access of you, or someone else to yours assets.further elaboration:pin protection will cover all your station assets, preventing anyone who is logged as you to:transfer isk from your wallets, personal or corp...to cancel or put contracts, private or public..to poke yours science tab.to even modify your market orders.to trash, sell, reprocess your items, or ships.to see your contacts, or notes.to do any corp stuff which you could do.etc...this prevention will only work for station based resources that you have.so if evil hacker doesn't know your pin, he will not be able to sniff yours stuff, excluding your ship in space if you did for example log off in space.you will need to remember it. it will not be secret questions, or answer to you retract your pin,it can be inserted only 3 times per login, if you made mistake tree times, you will not be able to type it for 24hr period.you will still be able to train your skills as you wish. without need to type it in.it will be based on session, one time entry of your pin, will last as long as you logged in game.your pin could be:a3a4e not only numbers, but also letters and caps, so it greatly reduces risk.and there will be pop-up window for you to insert it, or someone else, when that person wish to do something of above, for example, modify market orders.of course risk will always exist, and nothing is perfect defense, but it will hopefully prevent at least some headaches, which sometimes takes ages and wast resources on yours and ccp part to be relieved. update:as proposed down there, that authenticator + is also not a bad idea, but because some of us have multiple accounts, let it be possible to use one ""that thing"" for all of ours accounts.further elaboration: i believe that we should be able to get extra safety, true pin and all others stuff, which will be purchased as many cool objects in eve online store.but, dearest, lovable, hot ccp duded and girls, if you do implement this things let it be possible to connect multiple accounts with one authenticator or what is it called.also, if you dont know about what i am talking here, and you love kittens, feel free to support...for kittens."

11/26/2010,i think it would be best to just implement a security token ala wow/ffxi/and many asian mmos.
11/26/2010,"while we are at it, why not put a extra password that is send to our cellphones, which we have to enter in 60 seconds, every time we perform a transaction ..just keep a complex password with a username something other than your character name, or your real name .. and you will be just fineadd a couple of !@#$%^&*() to your password :p"
11/26/2010,"if the hacker got the username and password from a keylogger, they will know the pin also. if they got it from phishing, they would as easy convince the user to enter their station pin.sorry not supported as it is, but yes account security is a big problem, and perhaps you could expand it into something else. i like the full tilt poker image select option, where you have to choose 3 cards you have previously selected from the pack to enter the game...stops keyloggers, however unless the images were generated from a users own pc, would not stop phishing. it also would not stop any recording/remote access software. perhaps if the biggest hack access is keylogging, something like this might be worth an investment."
11/26/2010,"paying extra for additional security!? why if you can get it for free?not if you have calculator like box, with numbers and letters moving after each digit clicked (something like on screen keyboard)... did you clicked on a number, or a letter...no program would be able to detect. because even if there is programs which can remember position of click (not sure) on that position would be different number or later every time..."
11/26/2010,add an another password is not going to make it any better or any worse.keyloggers still crack that with no problem at all.seriously... do you people ever put any effort into thinking about your ideas or do you just toss them around like candy?as it's been said...physical token would be appropriate but only if its not forced on you.but imho... the only source of the security problem is the human factor... not the computer *not denying that there are some serious flaws but honestly its the user who refuses to take them with any amount of respect of that fear*where you go...how you use your computer... your habits... those are what makes you prone to being attacked.that and making foolish mistakes that people will never admit to doing... such as isk buying... going to sites without checking for validity... using the same user-name/pass on an another area of internets. list goes on and on and on.adding a pin number won't fix it... its just an another way to get hacked once again.
11/26/2010,"with that many restriction you would always have to use that extra pin. but since its basically just another password, it would just mean extra inconvenience for the user with little extra protection, because if someone can get your password, also getting your pin is a small step. what you want is authentication by another method or over another channel.besides, password and the like are actually a bad security mechanism: you have to reveal the secret every time you use it."

11/26/2010,"storyline: the leader of the sansh nation is (was) a caldari busniess man who was an arms manufacturer in the first caldari/gallente war.-he owned space and had a ring of close followers -he messed around with human genetics and cloning creation super human slaves. (true sansha)-the 4 empire factions looked down on him and proceeded to remove all sansha loyalist colonis/stations from empire space.-the sansha leader was reported dead in the last battle of this campaine- the sansha nation continued with its illicit research in to cloning and genetic engenearing- they also have ramped up their raids in to empire space through the use of some kind of timespace manipulation device (whs to u and me)-during their exile it is reported that they opened a wh to jove space where they captured and took over a jove station (giving them acces to tek beyond current marketed standards.the present: speratic reports of constelation wide assaults have been trickaling in to concord, who in turn have warned all rmpire naviesthe ships used by the sansha in these assaults are different to those of the regular sanshas that inhabit some aireas of space alreadyit is reported the the new ships are jove inspired varients of current known moddles. the new nightmare class bss are most feir****and have been spotted accompanying existing sanshas patrols, one report of this occurance was retrived from an armageddon class bs flown by the amarr navy (this amarr fleet has as yet not been found and the 1 black box is the only pice belived to have servived) (source: latest eon: short story within)the new sansha mom is the jewl in the sansha spearhead and is heavily infulanced by jove in its designe imo.and now my point:anything the faction navies throw at these sobs will die reguardless. they can not compeat with the new sansha ships, concord are also reluctent to take action as they are evanly matched with respect to tek.concord belives that rewarding pod pilots for helping in fighting back these new varients will be benificial as responce times of the average navy ship is 99% slower than that of of pod pilots and their upgreaded pod controaled shipssoz bout the spelling"

11/26/2010,"please do explain exactly why you were against it....i for one do not understand the objection, i am not trolling, and seriously would like to see a presented argument against them.i didn't realise what the assembly hall was until today and the learning skill death, i really wish i knew about it before, as in my mind, plex for remaps was an excellent idea.i have had a good look around this forum (ah), only thing i can see relevant is t'amber suggesting that mts are bad, while totally ignoring the fact that there is rmt sanctioned by ccp through plex, and character trading is also sanctioned. so basically plex for remaps is a micro transaction, and since micro-transactions are bad, plex for remaps is bad..... am i understanding this is the reason plex for remaps was cancelled?"
11/26/2010,"i have a question.when the learning goes will everyones attributes return to stand plus implants or will current remaps stand? if they are set to standard, will we get a free remap to readjust, like wise will we get a remap to reset our attributes to a more standard fit should the removal of learning skills overbalance our toon to much?"
11/26/2010,"i don't necessarily care about mt's themselves.however, remaps allow a definable in game advantage over the other players (in terms of faster training speed due to attribute adjustments). in a game i pay a monthly fee for, i think i should be able to compete against every other player on an even basis in terms of the game mechanics i have access to.you want plex for paintjobs, or plex for fancy hats, or plex for hookers - fine. because none of that affects my ability to access a game mechanic on an equal basis with you. plex for remaps violates that rule because we're basically saying that those with more disposable income deserve to have more advanced characters in terms of core mechanics (i.e. skill points) than people who (say) have kids to feed or mortgages to pay. this is exactly the reason i don't play f2p games like evony."
11/26/2010,"well, as malcanis' law states: whenever a mechanics change is proposed on behalf of ""new players"", that change is always to the overwhelming advantage of richer, older players.by this logic, the learning skills removal things should be a boon to the vets, or maybe i 'm misunderstanding the law."

11/26/2010,"now you see this is what i don't get.if someone has real life money in abundance, they can already gain a massive advantage over you through gtcs, or if someone is very well established in game, they can purchase pre-mades from the character bazaar to further increase their isk/hour. there are hundreds of thousands of characters in the game, each at different stages of skill training. you already have an advantage over lots of them through your training, and you are already disadvantaged against some by their training.if there is a character out there with equal skills, isk and time spent in game, and they decide to remap to go down a different route, how is that going change disadvantage you, or in anyway alter my previous paragraph? also, would you even care about this hypothetical toon, you will probably never meet him, and if you did, how would you know what he did?you would still have exactly the same opportunities to remap, and as plex are quite expensive, it is something people would have to weigh up.... do i purchase a plex for 400million to save 5 days training over the next month, or not...etc etc.however the benefits of the remaps in my eyes totally outweigh any slight possibly imagined disadvantages.players could remap if they get bored of their professions, or if they mess up there remap. the argument that mistakes should be punished i agree with, however spending an entire year with substandard training speed i think is just slightly over the top. they would still be punished with having to buy a plex.someone might decide rather than buy that shiny new faction ship, i will think longer term, and remap.... now the learning skills have gone, this is about a as good a substitute for them that there is. (i support getting rid of learning skills btw).well, what is done is done, and thanks for trying to explain :)"
11/26/2010,"actually, a majority of the veteran players are pretty happy at this change. not really bitter at all.comparing the removal of training skills to the removal of mt for remaps is idiotic. plex remaps were opposed because it started the dangerous trend of allowing a very tangible in game advantage in exchange for real money. not something i ever want to see in a game i pay for all ready.i also don't particularly care for character purchasing, but it's not as offensive as the plex for remap idea was.anyhow, this thread is pretty much just more whining about an issue that's all ready decided, and doesn't really belong on ah."
11/26/2010,has anyone figured out what the op is actually proposing yet?
11/26/2010,"you wonder that too, huh?"
11/26/2010,bitter vets you say thats getting a bit worn now i think emo noobs
11/26/2010,"so i've been pondering this subject for several months now. i believe i have a solutions that could help. i am a corp ceo myself and i have had this problem amongst myself and my members.corp hanger containersthis would essentially be a freight container with a password and be repackage-able small enough to be moved around in an industrial ship. this would solve a huge security problem with pos corp hangers and enable each member to have their own space without worry of others taking their equipment. this item can not be launched or anchored. this is primarily for pos corp hangers, it has little use in station corp hangers.essentially this is a very simple fix. just the addition of one item that is already very similar to existing items. just in case anyone is about to complain, a corp ceo/director would have unlimited access to these for purpose of moving or tearing down poses.update.........................................................................................................................................................................some recommended stats would be:description-a massive cargo container, used for corporate member storage; most commonly used in corporate hanger arrays.attributes-mass-1,000,000 kg-capacity-100,000 m3-volume-100,000 m3 (5,000 m3 packaged)"
11/26/2010,almost forgot to support my own idea.
11/26/2010,or so you think? perhaps this is high-grade troll?oh... btw.... idea not supported.
11/26/2010,"tl'dr - do not let eve turn intoproper textremoving learning skill is unfair towards those people who invested time and patience into developing them. some people invested into presence 5, even though they had low charisma attribute, the reason they did it - is because they planned in advance that they would want to train for leadership skills in the future. so they accepted lower training rate in return for future benefit. this decision-making was possible because ccp had a set of defined rules, which prescribes how game will be in the number of years down the road. right now time spent doing this seems like a waste. certainly there were similar examples in the past. when ccp changed all probes, a lot of people lost money on their blueprints. and being a reasonable person, i am willing to accept that certain changes are necessary for progression of the game. however there should be a line beyond which ccp should not go. eve online is all about decision making, you todays decisions affect your future, but that is only possible if rules are unchanged and clear. the way it looks now is that ccp keeps changing those rules. that habit can have adverse consequences.at least part of eve's success is attributable to the fact, that ccp has extremely loyal base of subscribers. such changes as remaps, plex for remaps, removal of learning skills will move game to more casual domain, but will dilute base of hard-core loyal players. hence ccp will have higher volatility of cash flows and higher turnover of player. do not move into that direction. not bending to general market trend, does not mean you are becoming dinosaurs. rather that company is choosing its own path for success.vote for no to removing learning skillshere is the opposite thread, feel free to check with supporters of learning skills removal"
11/26/2010,support
11/26/2010,"all attributes gets +12 base = normal learning skill bonus.all sp in learning skills are ""released"" and can be applied anywhere you want.i have gone through the blog and have to agree with the icelandic alcoholics, they actually thought this one out pretty thoroughly.system will be easier to understand and new players (read: alts) will be able to train useful skills sooner.my biggest problem is going to be deciding where i should use the 2m sp that will be freed up."
11/26/2010,completelly unrelated comment without any argument
11/26/2010,"i made this choice and the sacrifice. i am also happy to see the skills go. they are really really stupid. we already received years of training at increased speeds and now we can take our ""useless"" sp and stick it into something better."
11/26/2010,"way better argument however than saying because you suffered them everyone else should suffer them too. should we also make for everyone that their first expansion had the habbit of deleting boot.ini? because i suffered it everyone should suffer it?also eve player base has nothing to do with loyalty, but with having no alternative for internet spaceships in open universe. and the vast majority of the long term players (read: bittervets) see this as a good change."
11/26/2010,"how can an on-topic comment unrelated? even on my third read through of your post i cannot see what your argument is or even what it is you are aiming for. my guess is that you skimmed the blog and panicked, go back and read it again and you'll see that there is no cause for alarm."
11/26/2010,"learning skills are a big waste of time. it is a very big turn off for new players when they find out they have to train a month worth of learning skills or else they will pay the consequences in the end. those who spent all those learning skills lose nothing, u get your skill points reimbursed."

11/26/2010,because you are stupid and will be treated as such
11/26/2010,"i suffered through it - and i found it to be very stupid.whenever i tried to get friends (with jobs...) to play this game the learning skills were a huge turn-off. good riddance, ****ty game-design decision! awesome job, ccp."
11/26/2010,"support""the character will train trade skills so how much they are necessary.""""the character will train learning skills so how much they are necessary.""- is a completely similar statements. reasons in both skill group trainings also fully equal."
11/26/2010,"i think you are spitting into the wind here, the csm were pushing for learning skills to be changed or removed themselves...they are a big detractor from early enjoyment of the game, which is where it counts with regards to player retention. eve should be complex, but the complexity should not be at the expense of fun.and yes, i trained learning at the start (although not exclusively) and will be getting 5m sp to allocate."
11/26/2010,"huh? wtf are you trying to say? some grammar would be handy to make yourself understandable. anyway if i am going to guess what you are going at, everyone had to train learning skills directly in the beginning, there was no serious choice. trading skills are an option, you can do that, it costs time, but you can do stuff perfectly fine without them (i got 50m sp and lousy trading skills, and the reason they are lousy and not absolutely horrible was that i wanted to do some trading in null sec, then we got kicked out, so i didnt even use them ever). and no you cant do stuff perfectly fine without learning skills."
11/26/2010,"it's too late trying to change it now, they've already decided on it. i for one am glad, learning skills were such a stupid idea and the last thing you really want to be doing is training these skills for a month or so, just for the long term benefit. when you're on a trial account, you want to get in a nice shiny new ship as quickly as possible, not worry about training these ridiculous learning skills. well done ccp for finally getting rid of them and for allowing us to use any invested points into supplementing our other skills. i do have one question about spending these points, will you be able to train multiple skills up to level iv if you so choose and not be forced to put them all into a couple of level v skills? anyone can answer that if they know."
11/26/2010,"i am all for removing learning skills.they are just there to ruin the gaming experience for the new players.and with the method ccp is applying it, it will be fair for those who invested time for itat least it will be worth the time i had invested in them."
11/26/2010,"if anything it's unfair for those that didn't train them.player a) trained learning.* gets millions of extra skillpoints for the time they had them trained.* gets millions of extra skillpoints for the ""reembursement"" for their susposed ""loss"" (more about reduction of tears then balance)player b) didn't train learning.* gets no retroactive bonus.* has no real skillpoints to reemburse.player a comes out with a double bonus.the way this is designed has little to do with balance and everything to do with crowd control."
11/26/2010,"being rude in your topic doesn't really get you anywhere m8.however not supported, main reason is new players don't want to train learning, they just want to get into a ship and do something useful not spending there whole tutorial training 2 monthes of skills. and to the people that learned them, they get them back so who cares? i for one enjoy it, i invested 2 monthes to get 5.3m sp it did me well, now i can do those dreddit skills that take a month to do something new. for some it's a turn off but the game has to be new player friendly."
11/26/2010,"so what you are really saying is ""i had to waste time to train these skills, yet despite the fact this change is not going to affect me, i will be happier if others also have to go through this burden, because i had to."" ?"
11/26/2010,"simplification:without loosers there is also no victors...removing those skills removes yet another nice competition from the game, which is sad..."
11/26/2010,1
11/26/2010,"i completely disagree with your topic and do not support it.i have trained all learning skills on multiple accounts and do not feel it is unfair in the least. heck i even created this character origionally with chr 3 and very balanced stats for what i anticipated to be many years of training. i still trained presence all the way to 5 because you never know.remaps still required some amount of thought because of the one year limit on switching. it allowed players who have played the game for years, that wanted to switch it up the chance, and allowed for newer players to make a mistake that would not last an eternity, because in the end it is a game. if you came to just train skills, then yes remaps and the removing of learning skills might lead you to leave the game. for most of us, we tend to play for the sandbox/social/trade/industry/pvp/iskmaking(because i still think missions are boring as hell) parts of the game.any idiot who is a ""hardcore"" player that leaves because of this, good riddance, learning skills had pretty much no value to the experience of playing eve, any reasoning person could see that if they intended to play the game for any period of time it was nearly a requirement to train the learning skills.they don't add anything to the game, it only detracts people who might genuinely enjoy and contribute to the game from getting any further than the trial, because having to train learning skills at some point just to train ""actual"" skills has always been a negative aspect of the game.eve is more than complex and harsh enough in aspects of its gameplay to fit the ""hardcore"" players, without forcing them to train learning skills to get to what they enjoy."
11/26/2010,"eve may be all about griefing people, but for that to be fair it requires that an intelligent, competent player can avoid being griefed. but not so with the learning skills - either a newbie griefed himself by training them instead of something useful, or he griefed himself by not training them and instead suffered from ****ty attributes.good riddance."
11/26/2010,please link for me where ccp says they will never alter the game to make it better.should ccp also remove all balancing they have done in the last 6 years ?remove capital ships ?remove invention ?remove t2 ?remove officer gear ?remove faction warefare ?remove soverienty ?remove pos ?remove exploration sites ?remove wormholes ?remove pi ?sorry if you feel you have been nerfed in some way. but you really havnt.you will be given back all the points you put into learning you have not lost that training.stop selfishly worrying about your own person situation and start thinking about what makes eve a better game.
11/26/2010,"not supported. solution looking for an issue, learning skills are cancer, and cancer needs to be removed.as it will be.good riddance."
11/26/2010,"shut up, get out, give stuff"
11/26/2010,"every player in eve is allowed to make stupid mistakes, some examples: - people who didn't train their learning skills (or far too low)- people who trained unnecessarily high (like you).ccp is now correcting that mistake for you, and you get a big bag of sp as a bonus. so my advice to you is to deal with it."
11/26/2010,confirming this is the best course of action.
11/26/2010,"i can't shoot the roids!!! i support this idea. asteroids returns!!!oh, and to the op, no! compromise is going to make someone unhappy, always. this time it's you and not me. next time, i'm sure it will be flipped around."

11/26/2010,"i don't know if this is even possible but when i am flying through space toward something or stopped somewhere, most of the time the sun is right in my eyes. now many of you will say that i should just turn away except that that would also turn me away from what i'm looking at (such as a gate). so what i propose is an option to turn the sun off. at the very least reduce the glare it puts out. this is perfectly suitable to a game of internet spaceships that have mastered warp drive but for some reason don't have filtered viewports or cameras."
11/26/2010,"i wouldn't mind the suns being a bit dimmed, or at least having the option to do so. supported."
11/26/2010,very supported. also dim down nebulae. holy **** they made those bright.
11/26/2010,"when i started they were almost blinding, still sort of are, needs to be added"
11/26/2010,"as someone who uses the sun as a probing point, a 1000 times yes."
11/26/2010,"oh god yes. i support both ideas. give an option to dim the sun, and another do dim nebulae and other blinding objects in space."
11/26/2010,i pray for this ability around 7 am every gd morning.
11/26/2010,i have run into this as well.supported.
11/26/2010,wont hurt anyone that does not want to use it. supported
11/26/2010,supporting my own idea for making eve a better place to fly serious spaceships with no sun glare.also thank you for the supports so far. it is appreciated.
11/26/2010,"but what would light your solar systems?eve would be pitch black with only station and ship lights if not for the suns for the systems. dimming for sure, turning off, no."
11/26/2010,"(sorry for the informal way i will be posting... this is my first time getting involved in the forums)intro: one of the things that actually got me to play this wonderful game that is known to be eve, are the videos that are on youtube. videos such as, ""eve online"", ""day of darkness"", and the ccp made trailers really inspires a player to stop whining about the difficulty of the game (the horrid learning cliff). but in many of these videos the longer engine trails are intact.i have played for around 6 months, and i was wondering when i would get this fantastic engine trail that looked awesome, but recently i have found out that it was a feature that was taken out due to it's new code not functioning as ccp would like it too. ):proposal: bring back the longer engine trails, previous dev post says that it is on ccp's list of things to do, and this is just a reminder that (at least me) wants the longer engine trails back. my request is to add them to be functional with an option to turn the effect on and off. thus players who are bothered by the improper functions of the engine trail can turn it off, and others who enjoy such a feature can keep it on.pros:-makes eve seem much more streamlined like, it adds a vital visual interest for new players.-some players want velocity vectors, this can be such a tool if created properlycons:-additional work for ccp-possible performance issues, and improper allocation of the engine trails.bring the engine trails back, i miss them."
11/26/2010,we all miss them.it was engine trails that made me train for interceptors way back in the day.one of these days..
11/26/2010,"me wants them engine trails t_t ...tired of looking all slow...you know without these engine trails... it looks like the ship is standing still and just the environment was moving... <---- is what it looked like the first time i played, i thought it was stupid and quit the trial... came back a year later when i was introduced to videos with the engine trails xd"
11/26/2010,heck yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!really really want this!!!!
11/26/2010,"also want.if not brought back, fly your ship around with 10% hull left, that looks pretty :)"
11/26/2010,must be the 100st proposal for this..
11/26/2010,"first off: this is not a rage thread about learning. they're changing it and we can't do anything about it.after thinking about the learning skills and realizing it's only aiding new players (which is good) but sort of hurting the old players, (all the sp missed from not having maxed learning right off the bat; dumb training) i've thought of something else related to allocating skill points that can benefit older players, too.now even though i don't consider myself a veteran (i'm only about 1 year old) and i feel i haven't made any dumb decisions on training (i did learning right off the bat, and i've specialized in only 1 ship and little else,) i think there should be a way to make up for the skill points you wasted on dumb stuff. this would benefit older players that made mistakes, and since they're not getting all the sp they could of had, at least they can get rid of stuff they tried and realize wasn't the best route for them.basically you would be able to pick a skill and bring down the sp on it to your liking and put it in something else. i've thought it out, and there are some cons with it. right off the bat it screams easy pvp switching. someone saw you dock in a domi? hell, change your sp and come out in a raven. so there are some ideas i came up with to deal with this.i think this should either be a one time thing, or a once a year thing (like the remap). this would avoid the obvious problems, and still allow players to change as they go, sort of like remaps do.any input or suggestions are more than welcome. thank you very much."
11/26/2010,so skill point remappingwhat an original idea how about no?
11/26/2010,"well, i'm not a year old like you, but i also trained by learning skills up first thing thanks to advise from a veteran friend. personally i think its a find compromise since i get my points back and those points will get me close to my t2 guns. sounds like merry christmas to me."
11/26/2010,"like i said, i'm not a veteran, so i don't know if it's come up before. just something i've been thinking about.may i ask why you say no? constructive criticism is good criticism."
11/26/2010,will you please tick that you support. thanks!
11/26/2010,"better idea: reverse training.you pick a skill to ""untrain"". it ""untrains"" at twice the speed that it would train. as it untrains, the sp get put back into the pool which you can then redistribute elsewhere. you can't train and untrain at the same time.it'd allow rectification of old mistakes without being blatantly exploitable."
11/26/2010,don't you think if it was a once a year thing it wouldn't be exploitable?
11/26/2010,"well, it would allow sudden change. you could, overnight, go from elite miner to high-end mission runner. sure, the change would only occur once a year, but it'd still be exploitable. of course you could impose further restrictions, but..even besides that, it's also too limited; what is the purpose of these skill remaps? to rectify mistakes? rectifying mistakes only once a year is a bit off. and using it as a means to alter your character.. well, that shouldn't be the point. in most games it would, but eve is pretty heavily based around specialization. allowing drastic changes of profession in a short time would do a bit of damage to that concept, and it is pretty key."
11/26/2010,"right but it would allow to better specialize. and also, it does help with mistakes and wasted training, sort of the same path on the removal of learning skills.the problem i see with the training is it adds even more time, and this is to benefit the players, especially the older ones that had trained up skills either due to mistakes or the fact that they had too (before the skill queue.)i do see where you're coming from, though. thank you for the input."
11/26/2010,"in the long run, mistakes are simply stepping stones for other activities. that or they are learning experiences. how else would you know that mining is boring unless you actually trained up for those t2 lasers with anticipation only to watch the slightly faster light show? when it comes to ""mistakes"" being ""i trained the wrong weapon system"" well, people may have ditched projectiles only to later regret it (or rockets, assuming this fix is on that same level). there really aren't training mistakes as there are no training ceilings."
11/26/2010,the only bad sp investment in eve is multitasking.
11/26/2010,"i understand. i still think there should be a way for the older players to be able to redeem some of their skill points, since they're not gaining the skill points retroactive to training their learning skills. and it would also benefit everyone if its once a year."
11/26/2010,"i fail to see a major issue with what ccp is doing, vets had learning trained, so they were getting more sp anyways.more vets didnt max learning anyways.all sp is being refunded, and tbh, thats a few mil sp, will be amazing for vets and noobs alikealso didnt they say they are removing the 1.6m sp boost? so how are new players at a new advantage, its no more wasteing time training learning"
11/26/2010,learn to read nub.seriously... the op is obviously a blind troll.the dev blog was very clear about this.if you have taken the time to train those skills... you get those sp's back.everyone *regardless* gets +12 attribute points across the board in absence of the learning skills.how the hell does that hurt older pilots? this could have been much worse.stop trolling and making a mountain out of a damn molehill.ps: you've only played a year...and you feel you should speak for older pilots? scuse me? who asked you? *2 year old*
11/26/2010,"unfortunately, eve players do not drink milk. they drink battery acid with ground glass mixed in for fiber."
11/26/2010,proposal - get out
11/26/2010,see what i mean this is just a stupid process for appeasing the stupid and the pseudo-intellectual meat. get rid of them!
11/26/2010,"i'm afraid i can not find fault with the csm because ccp doesn't listen to them enough. the fact is they are doing exactly what we elected them for, to bring our concerns to ccp. what ccp chooses to do after that is out of csm's control. i might suggest you aim your anger towards ccp for not listening to the will of the people."
11/26/2010,"seems trolling in the ah forums is considered normal now too.. @op - in case you're not trolling, go screw yourself."

11/26/2010,too late...you just said you where wrong and stupid.so much for not contradicting yourself. :)

11/26/2010,"well transwarp mod can be like 10mins for covop-bomber, 20mins for recons, 30mins for black ops, then like 1 hour for blockade runners. moreover, you can easily set it so an alliance can only have 1 transwarp pos mod and black ops portal only works for same alliance. even then... with the delays its hardly workable as you describe."
11/26/2010,"black op discussioni would like to reform your idea into something better: covert ops bridge module that works like a covert cyno but u need 2 of them fitted on 2 black ops. one on one side and the other on the otherside. once connected this creates a portal true a black hole. a rupture in space continuum that can only support a x amount of mass. 50,000m3 or so. this recuires only fuel to start up the bridge (xx amount lets say 1000 racial fuel for each bo). range is unlimited, bridge last for 1 minut."

11/26/2010,"[proposal] hostile wrecks in empire space.proposal to change the mechanic where if you kill someone the wreck has no aggression rights from you; allowing you to defend what is your loot, it has tractor rights, much like a can or npc wreck, but no aggression timer. this creates an entirely risk free way to generate isk.examples :ninja salvage in missions,if you grab a wreck in a mission, you get mission runner aggression.can flipping, you can steal cans to grant yourself a monetary gain, but there again is an aggression timer.in closing, in a game where there are zero risk free ways to make isk, why does this loop hole still exist where there is ownership of a wreck, to the killer, and no safeguard allowing them to atleast strike back at people that take what they have earned?also there is a disturbing trend developing of highsec bots in populated areas that are macroing loot.addedccp incognito: ninja salvaging is intended game play. it was always intended that the wrecks are public, the loot is private."
11/26/2010,"marine salvage lawmarine salvage is the process of rescuing a ship, its cargo, or other property from peril. salvage encompasses rescue towing, refloating a sunken or grounded vessel, or patching or repairing a ship. today the protection of the environment from cargoes such as oil or other contaminants is often considered a high priority.""salvors"" are seamen and engineers who carry out salvage to vessels that are not owned by themselves, and who are not members of the vessel's original crew. when salvaging large ships, they may use cranes, floating dry docks and divers to lift and repair ships for short journeys to safety towed by a tugboat. the aim of the salvage may be to repair the vessel at a harbour or dry dock, or to clear a channel for navigation. another reason for salvage may be to prevent pollution or damage to the marine environment. alternatively the vessel or valuable parts of the vessel or its cargo may be recovered for its resale value, or for scrap.salvage law has as a basis that a salvor should be rewarded for risking his life and property to rescue the property of another from peril. salvage law is in some ways similar to the wartime law of prize, the capture, condemnation and sale of a vessel and its cargo as a spoil of war, insofar as both compensate the salvor/captors for risking life and property.[1] the two areas of law may dovetail. for instance, a vessel taken as a prize, then recaptured by friendly forces on its way to the prize adjudication, is not deemed a prize of the rescuers (title merely reverts to the original owner). but the rescuing vessel is entitled to a claim for salvage.[2] likewise a vessel found badly damaged, abandoned and adrift after enemy fire disabled her does not become a prize of a rescuing friendly vessel, but the rescuers may claim salvage.[3]a vessel is considered in peril if it is in danger or could become in danger. examples of a vessel in peril are when it is aground or in danger of going aground. prior to a salvage attempt the salvor receives permission from the owner or the master to assist the vessel. if the vessel is abandoned no permission is needed.the amount of the award depends on, in part, the value of the salved vessel, the degree of risk involved and the degree of peril the vessel was in. legal disputes do arise from the claiming of salvage rights. to reduce the amount of a claim after an accident, boat owners or skippers often remain on board and in command of the vessel; they do everything possible to minimise further loss and seek to minimize the degree of risk the vessel is in. if another vessel offers a tow and the master or owner negotiates an hourly rate before accepting then salvage does not apply.some maritime rescue organisations, such as britain's royal national lifeboat institution, insist the crews of their lifeboats renounce their right to claim compensation for salvage.jetsam are goods that were thrown off a ship, which was in danger, to save the ship. flotsam are goods that floated off the ship while it was in danger or when it sank. ligan or lagan are goods left in the sea on the wreck or tied to a buoy so that they can be recovered later by the owners. derelict is abandoned vessels or cargo.in the united kingdom under the merchant shipping act 1995, jetsam, flotsam, lagan and all other cargo and wreckage remain the property of their original owners. anyone, including recreational divers and beachcombers, removing those goods must inform the receiver of wreck to avoid the accusation of theft. as the leisure activity of wreck diving is common, there are laws to protect historic wrecks of archaeological importance and the protection of military remains act 1986 protects ships and aircraft that are the last resting place of the remains of members of the armed forces.the 1910 brussels convention for"

11/26/2010,no.
11/26/2010,"not supported: incorrect premise, there is an owner of the wreck, it should be the killed. there is no reason the wreck should belong to the killer and this would encourage even more suicide ganking."

11/26/2010,"this has been a problem for a long time. it would make more sense if the person who shot the ship also got agression to the person who stole it, or; if there was a cooldown timer - for example 30 seconds - to everyone but the victim and the members of the corp who shot it.it unfair that this is not the case."
11/26/2010,"yep, you get a point, stasis web and enough heat to make the kill, you take the risk and hope his mates arent close - your reward - an empty wreck cause a guy hangs off the tail of the wartarget and loots it before you can get close enough. theres enough mercs outthere who go through the same scenario - its time to put it right surely?"

11/26/2010,here is where i stopped reading and caring.also ib4l
11/26/2010,it's a mistake. del it please
11/26/2010,"ok so i really like your plans for the learning skills, gg ccp, very simple change that's satisfied everyone except the stupidest of noobs and most bitter of vets. in the interest of quick and easy changes that streamline the experience of character development (read: less waiting for more pvp) i would like to propose the idea of removing all +1-+5 implants, and removing the +attribute modifiers from the other slot one through five implants, while keeping the stat bonus's and set bonus's. whether or not ccp wants to couple this with a + to everyone's attributes (+5 would keep the min/max sp/hour the same) is at their discretion, although i support it entirely. what does this do (positive/negative)? seeing as how everyone gets cybernetics 5 and +5 implants asap as with the learning skills (read: mandatory train) it keeps with the spirit of the current changes being implemented. all % stat bonus's and set bonus's (snakes, slaves,etc) would remain the same, so customization of your character remain unchanged, it would simply allow more newer players to engage in pvp in all regions of space without the fear of being podded and losing alot of isk (+5 set is 500,000,000.00+++) which is notably harder for newer players to acquire than it is for older players. obvious counterpoint: yes you can get jumpclones and save those +5's in your mission system for grinding iskies for pvp, as a new player you still have to learn to have jumpclones, learn about proper use of them, find someone with standings to help you, or get ready for a long grind, and then most people still put +2-+3's in their pvp clones to mitigate the sp/hour their losing from being in the +5 clone. i would suggest that any current work around for this issue requires either significant time, isk, or insider knowledge, none of which should be necessary for newer players to get out and pvp, this is the same anti-choice that learning skills were.informed counterpoint: yes this would slightly reduce the largest isk sink in the game, tho with a little work you could easily add implants to the current lp stores, if that gives an incentive to add more % stat bonus implants then all the better, that would actually increase the largest isk sink (read: good for the economy) and increase the amount of customization between characters. major contention: ccp would have to come up with a way to mitigate the problem of people who currently own implants, although it would cause some strife i would like to think this would be another change that would be welcome considering it would improve everyone's gameplay experience, although anyone stockpiling them would obviously need some kind of payment. (read: yes their worth a small fortune) ((read: because you have to have them)) (((read: no choice = bad sandbox)))ending point: any serious pvp'er would still have a full ten set of implants to modify whatever ship he/she uses, so it would keep with the current risk vs reward without bordering on causing xenophobia for newer players.tl;dr: remove attribute implants, more pvp for everyonebut really, read it, think about it, respond with positive criticism please, i spent an hour+ making this idea decent for you to read. i have a feeling this idea is going to be flamed, if you understand the idea though its not a reduction in game-play, its not dumbing anything down, its actually a chance to expand on customization, it simply allows in the process to open up pvp to more casual and newer players. this idea can be adjusted, this is a framework for the overall concept that ccp would work on, please support the topic and keep it bumped if you feel this has any merit, i would really like the opinion of the council and/or of any developers that may be lurking about.thank you for your time. sorry for the wall of text. hope this happens soon, more yar for the newbs"
11/26/2010,"okay, no, sorry. i'm one of the biggest anti-learning-skills guys on eve, but the key is that i recognize where they start and end.learning skills are key because there's no actual reason not to get them. you get them, you train them, you're set for life (barring clone stupidity). implants don't do this; you can lose them. that's a big deal. you can train faster, but it's risky. if you want to negate that risk, you have to sit in your station all day. it's a gameplay choice, and it's actually an interesting one. sure, you can keep jump clones about, but you can only do that once every 24 hours, and you don't benefit from the implants when they're not in your head.also, i sincerely doubt +5s are even a tenth as common as learning skills are."
11/26/2010,this is a good suggestion and i support it.
11/26/2010,"op fail. as mentioned before - implants are different. many use them not just as attribute modifiers, but also as sets to give people bonuses.please get into your ship and activate self destruct. do it for your pod too."
11/26/2010,bad idea.i don't support this.
11/26/2010,huh? i know of no one that are not planning on using command implants who train cybering 5. then again i live outside of the concord sphere of influence so poddings are a part of my daily routine.if your goal is to reduce the isk sink involved in podding then a much better solution is to cut the jump-clone standing requirement. taking it down to 5 from the current 8 would allow all but the newest of players to have at least one jc to use when they feel the need to go weekend warrior
11/26/2010,"i would say obvious troll, on the other hand you never can be sure."
11/26/2010,"terrible idea. i understand what you want though, but this isnt the way to do it."
11/26/2010,"btw i stated that set bonus's would remain the same, so you sir definitely didnt read.actually this change wouldnt affect me at all, i have the isk to buy a new set of implants when i get podded, its an earnest suggestion for newer players.i dont think many of you actually read the whole thing and gave it some thought, it may not be perfect but the point is to get more people engaging in all different kinds of pvp. also this change would increase the isk sink in getting podded by adding new set bonus implants for the one through five slots, also adding more customization, but my original post said as much."
11/26/2010,do not supporti like to pod someone knowing he has +5 implants
11/26/2010,so now youd be enjoying podding someone with a full slave set and slots six through ten full of expensive % implants.. nothing would change as far as that goes. read it all or dont post.
11/26/2010,"wow.i should be amazed this only took one day for someone to start on this, but i'm actually not"
11/26/2010,"another person that didnt bother to read.. this is not taking anything away or dumbing anything down. i have tried to keep my opinions out of this thread, personally i would make the game alot harder, no one has had any constructive arguments or thoughts?"
11/26/2010,"wrong, and a pitiful attempt."
11/26/2010,looks like we're gonna have to nuke it from orbit.
11/26/2010,"to the op, if you want them removed i suggest you unplug yours and train like that. the rest of us will keep ours in and be happier for it."
11/26/2010,you took a long time to get to the troll...i don't see how encouraging newbs to offer themselves as targets because they won't lose an implant will change game behavior.eacs is available for the noobs that need jcs to protect the implants. even you can use the service (barring alacta hasn't read your troll). implants are head rigs for a reason.i want to vote no to this idea!
11/26/2010,what is this about again?all i saw was a rant about how expensive they are.you know what? honestly they are not as expensive as they seem.there are ways to get them for cheaper you know.but its a little too obvious the op is just full of himself and hasn't really thought about it.too obvious... def. a troll.
11/26/2010,everyone who supported removal of learnings should support this excellent proposal by op!
11/26/2010,this idea is fail. learning implants =/= learning skills.
11/26/2010,my problem with implants has to do with how pirate implants don't have +4 and +5 versions.
11/26/2010,i actaully thing the current missions should be 'random'different ships / different type of resistances and even random warp scramblers.the fact that someone can go to a webpage to see exactly how to kill a pocket / which pocket / and which ship to take last is a bit silly.thats my opinion on current missions - but i like the idea of new/ player made ones too.
11/26/2010,"good day.when we fighting or mining, puts a target on a square and a line through the entire display.squer i understand it well, but the line is unnecessary when you are mining. this is annoying.is there any option to repeal the lines, but retention in the square?if it can not be done. this is perhaps the eve developers to create such an opportunity."
11/26/2010,maybe it will be part of the most requested item in the csm prioritization.fix the ui!it's not like ccp hasn't thought of this before either... watch the butterfly or dominion video for a tease of what an alternate ui might be like.
11/26/2010,you can turn this off now.escape - general settings - show targeting crosshair
11/26/2010,"background: the algorithm used in the vote counting for the issue prioritization is sub-optimal as measured by voting criteria. in addition to failing a number of basic voting criteria it also places restrictions on how much 'assistance' users can supply in their votes requiring both a minimum number of choices and placing a restriction on that number. there are a number of ranked choice voting methods which are mathematically better compared with the existing system - condorcet methods providing the most potential. the voting mechanism would allow participants to rank as many options as they wish in order of preference, they could pick only one, or they could rank every single option in order, the number of options a participant selects would have no bearing on the weight of their choices in the final count so there would be no incentive to select only a large or small number of items, only the number of issues you actually care about (all others would be assigned an equal 'least important' vote).i understand the existing vote counting is performed by some code created by trebor, i would be happy to provide technical assistance in implementation, up to and including development of a new 'fair' counting mechanism."
11/26/2010,"hey, that's precisely stuff i'd be interested in toying with!the fact is i lack mainly motivation to collect nuggets of knowledge about voting mechanisms (when you say failing at a number of basic criteria, i suppose you already know more than i about arrow's or the gibbard-satterthwaite theorems, for i barely know of their existence ;)on the other hand, if i knew enough of coq or only got my stroustrup back, i'd gladly try to implement stuff. hell, i'd even learn enough of cgi or perl if that could make it more useful ;)of course, there are already a few implementations of anything we could try to deal with here. you can find a few of them from wikipedia. yet, as long as i don't understand it, i don't buy it ;)whatever, if you have pointers to precise voting systems mechanics, please seed ;)"
11/26/2010,"yes, i know, there's a csm topic about that but the forum thread has been closed, so why not make this one live?i couldn't support mandatory crews to fly a ship: after all we never hired any and we've been flying everything proprely this far haven't we?on the other hand.. i love this idea... feels lack it should have always been there, y'know? slots: it could fit in a rig (simpler to balance) or it could depend on the ship size (frig are know to be flown by the capsuleer alone).mo: when you hire a crew it doesn't give you any bonus. (hell it could even be a drawback to fly around with rookies on board) but the longer you manage to keep them alive, the better they get. yes, it means pvpers would probably need to hire new ones often... it would make sense that crew grows skillful more quickly when you're pvp-ing than mining in 1.0.max ship upgrade: fully-trained crew should be a little more competitive than a rig, i think, because it costs you more time to get it there. isk sink: either you them a salary (daily, weekly, monthly?) or you just buy them... it's a way to get isk out of eve's economy, and at this point this looks like a good thing.cons: obviously, balance issues in fight (easily balanced if crew are only slightly superior to rigs) balance issues in economy (because crew can't be reproccessed/arbitraged)complexity: i don't think new players should have to worry about that on frig and dessies... and let's face it: it's not that complicated: you buy the crew-fitting rig, you hire the crew you try not to lose the ship... even in code it doesn't look that complicated to keep the track of crew and xp. besides i would rather keep it simple: no fancy notions like feeding/morale...moral issues about buying selling people (see them as sport players, mate), or about buying people you'll take to their death. problem of being hated by your crew (if that's a problem at all)"
11/26/2010,i was also thinking of asking if trade commodities(which right now are only used for trade)could go down to planets to improve different aspects of your colony in planetary interactionthis is a very common yet needed idea.supported
11/26/2010,"i like it except for the part where your ship gets better the longer your crew is there. i say implement it but keep it simple, dont do stuff like that."
11/26/2010,"yes. i would prefer more macro than micromanagement, so keep it simple, but make sure crew members are transferable from ship to ship."
11/26/2010,linkagebreed them on planets!train them in stations! (hello incarna)hire them to ships!and use them in fighters!
11/26/2010,"very yes.i want the crew to do something though, like gain experience or similar. if its just annoying overhead, then its not so good."
11/26/2010,"while i like the core of this idea, i must point out that it runs contrary to the ""pod technology"" that defines eve. the idea being that a single capsuleer, in a pod, can fulfill all the functions of an entire crew -this also justifies the diverse training skills required to fly a ship, eg, engineers engineer and gunners gun. for crewing to happen, ccp would need to create some backstory that eliminates the capsule- you can't command a large crew from within a pod. crew members must be more than insignificant mortals or there's no justification for their being on a ship. they would have specific skill sets necessary for the function of the ship. with this being the case, what happens to skill training? the change you propose is massive. pod tech is central to the game. i'm not convinced that the pros outweigh the cons."
11/26/2010,"that's wrong. the chronicles mention there is crew, and ccp whoever that writes them has confirmed several times that ships have crews, you just don't see their escape pods due to technical problems with it.the crews are already there, they just don't do anything tangible in game. especially in bigger ship classes you need thousands just for maintenance."
11/26/2010,"supporting this. i basically would be happy if crew acted like skill hardwiring implants for ships, but which cost isk every week/month to upkeep and come in various quality levels.further to this - please give us ""crews"" for our pi facilities, and let us use slaves in them!"
11/26/2010,"can we give them our learning skills?make them faster, better, and more durable?"
11/26/2010,"honestly i don't give them escape pods because they caused my ship to blow up, so they go down with it, as for me, i just watch the fireworks :d"

11/26/2010,what he said.
11/26/2010,"there is no grinding!! please read the post properly! - you dont go round shooting rats, mining etc to skill up you just using that mod and ship etc for a length of time, so you become experienced in using it."
11/26/2010,as opposed to your whiny i want everything now attitude?stop trolling dude.
11/26/2010,are you thick? seriously are you totally a dumbass? it would take the exact same time as it does now to train the levels!!! jeez read the fecking post!
11/26/2010,"in order to get cruiser skills, i have to fly a cruiser.in order to fly a cruiser, i have to get cruiser skills.whoops.but really, that's not the point; eve's skill system is really quite a nice thing in and of itself. it can get a bit tedious sometimes waiting for long periods, but for the most part, it's great; the whole point of ""leveling up"" in most mmos is that they want you to spend time before being powerful. eve just cuts straight to the chase and says ""hey, you still have to wait for power, but in the meantime, do whatever the hell you want."" i like that. i'd genuinely hate to see it leave.you seem to have taken the existence of a problem for granted; i'm a bit guilty of that myself, but it's always something you should be careful of. always make sure the problem actually exists before you make a suggestion. in this case, i don't know if the problem exists, and i don't think it does.i'm open to convincing, but at the moment, i can't support a solution to a problem i'm not even sure exists."

11/26/2010,"takes one to know i one i guess current system where they make one ship/module/race overpowered for an entire (or multiple) patch cycles at a time is ridiculous (->gallente->nano->amarr->matar->?).spending the required time and resources to not only balance what needs it but to lay out a detailed internal plan for what the various races/ship-classes are supposed to do will make any future work done in this area a lot easier - reference material is gold. fotm will always exist in one form or another but by putting in the effort to ""spread it out"" and making it as diverse as possible the game experience as a whole wins big."

11/26/2010,"to use this feature, you must be docked at a station with a medical facility.this feature is subject to the same limitations as jump clone services. (namely: personal or corporate standings of 8.0 or higher towards the npc corporation in question are required.)cost calculation:facility rent: 50 million isk (base cost for each remapping)personnel/material cost: 20 million isk per reassigned attribute pointat 14 attribute points that can be reassigned, total cost range would be 70 million to 330 million isk. the entire sum (as it is being paid to an npc faction) is removed from the isk faucet.for player-controlled stations or super-capitals with medical facilities, the facility rent could be set to any number between 0 and 50 million isk. this portion of isk is then transferred to the corporation/super-cap pilot in question.personnel/material cost would remain the same (you have to hire outside specialists to do the job etc.), and this isk portion is directly removed from the game.so, in theory, corporations/alliances controlling such facilities could offer the service cheaper than npc factions, if they so choose.-----------so why is this different than plex for remap? people with a lot of isk / rl cash to spend on plex will still have an advantage!!yes, they will.the differences are:1. this does not tamper with the plex market as it is.2. the isk used for remaps will be removed from the isk faucet and help prevent inflation.3. this solution makes sense from a rp / game integrity point of view. extremely expensive solution found to circumvent braindamage caused by frequent neural remaps - makes sense. handing over item paid for with rl money for additional remap - doesn't make sense."
11/26/2010,"no, just no."
11/26/2010,you really think this will get support?
11/26/2010,"i don't know. quite a few people seemed upset plex for remap (which i strongly opposed) didn't make it into the game.personally, i don't care much, one way or the other. i have not remapped in years, and could remap now any time i want to. but i think this solution wouldn't be detrimental to anyone, and help drain isk from the game - which would be an important bonus for everyone who likes a stable economy."
11/26/2010,"330m is too cheap, but yea been suggested and would work,how many people can honestly afford to remap every month at prices like this yes there are trillionare and multi billionares, but adverage player will not spend the isk to remap many more then once or twice a year."
11/26/2010,"i was trying to aim for a plex price there, more or less, and the numbers were neat and clean. of course those could be adjusted. i wouldn't make the facility rent disproportionately large, however, as that would give those groups owning stations etc. too much of an advantage. it's supposed to be a small additional bonus, nothing more."
11/26/2010,thumbs down.. dont make my eve feel like runequest.
11/26/2010,"i like, also brings some skill decision making back when the learning skills are gone....""do i buy this nice shiny new ship, or wait a month and remap to optimize my skills?"""
11/26/2010,"they already told that there will be no remap for plex, isk or anything. or not?enough already..."
11/26/2010,"okay so your run your missions and you have you nice salvo cane waiting in station, when some ""uber"" prober comes into your mission and start salvaging. not only can you not kill the guy because hes leaving all the loot in cans, but you know hes making alot of money that should be yours. you cant do anything unless he steals the loot and pretty much if he does that its because they're in a pvp ship fit to nuet your pve ship to death. an quick fix would be simply to make salvaging any wreck that isn't yours an aggro bringing action. or, the what about bring out a dropable object that when put into space and active makes probing out your mission/safe spot harder. not impossible never impossible but just harder. make these people work for there free income."
11/26/2010,per ccp mitnal: per gm faolchu : per senior gm ytterbium : per ccp prism x : per ccp incognito : (these quotes are kept handy for your convenience at ironfleet.com.)
11/26/2010,"then making it harder to probe you out should be an option, cause its annoying. componants are pricey the right mission salvage is worth millions and not being able to protect that is annoying. and while ccp might not call it stealing, its money out of the pocket of the mission runner. every mission runner has had someone do this to them at some point, and at lease making it harder for them to find should be an option."
11/26/2010,"making deadspace and mission deadspace harder to probe will make it a safespot for ewar, logi and other ships that can be scaned down in fleet fights.mission running is a no risk isk think and massively profitable compared to other careers. and your angry at people who's profession makes less then your bounties and only bother you once in a while in mission hubs leaving you to salvage 90% of the time.thats pretty greedy."
11/26/2010,"this is eve, im out for myself most of the time. but i did say make it harder not impossible. atm theres nothing to be done. having said all this im getting to the stage were my alts will just mine me my income and i can stop running missions in highsec all together. its just very annoying seeing isk fly out the door."
11/26/2010,"this is a non-issue imo. i get jumped in on a lot, and i'm still doing l3s in a cane. if the ninjas bother you, shoot your own wrecks to make sure that no one gets the salvage. that chases off a lot of em. sure, you cant come back and salvage but then neither can he. if you can't have your salvage, then no one can! when one finally does steal from your can/wreck, shoot him if you think you can take him. many of these guys get used to carebears not looking for a fight and decide to help themselves to loot and salvage because they know many players wont do anything about it. be careful though, often they will leave and return with a bigger ship while they still have a timer to shoot back. thats why i like to wait until the end of the mission before engaging, and cleaning up wreckage beforehand if possible. multi-room missions still leave plenty of stuff behind for them to come back and extend the aggro timer, so i typically avoid combat in those unless i'm ready to chill for a couple hours.i managed to kill a ninja who jumped in on my mission the other day. i popped all my wrecks after he stole, then sicked my t2 drones on him and watched them eat away at his frigate. when his ship went up in flames, i took out his wreck too, then docked to let the timer cool while he probably waited in a bs outside my station. if i'd left any cans/wrecks behind he'd be able to keep extending the timer until they despawn, and have a much larger window to get revenge. in the end he lost a cheap ninja ship but its not what they expect out of most mission runners.many ninjas work together in areas and will tip off one another to who is a known hostile who should be avoided, and who is a pushover they can steal from without repercussions. the very next day someone else from his ninja corp jumped in on one of my missions and stole. he made it to the final room of my plex and saw i was still there, then took off before i had the chance to target him. either he got something valuable from the previous rooms he didn't want to lose, or word gets around about who they should avoid.if you don't want to try to scare them away then you're better off running missions in a less populated area. but remember there is always the chance someone will drop in to say hello..."
11/26/2010,"stop missioning in the main hubs.i run level 4s (when i am not in a wormhole) in a little system well off the beaten path. i have been bothered by ninjas about three times in the two years i have been playing eve.though, frankly, the salvage market is so crap lately i don't bother salvaging at all. i just blitz the missions and leave the wrecks behind."
11/26/2010,"op! i found the problem. your logic is flawed.see, as the first person pointed out, its not your salvage, so it really shouldn't matter. there, now there shouldn't be an issue right?"
11/26/2010,"i could care less. if some ninja finds his way in and wants it, he can have it. hell, i'll even turn it blue for him. i normally salvage all my missions but if they're that desperate, i'm always in the sharing mood."
11/26/2010,"while i mission it will be an issue for me. salvage is pricey as i make a good 40m a day from it. while that might not be alot to some, its a good amount to me."
11/26/2010,right. but its not yours. so the point that you make money from it is moot.
11/26/2010,"i completely understand where you're coming from sync, but it's just one of those eve things that you have to learn to live with and work around. sure, it sucks but it's unlikely to change.i don't like suicide ganks, market hi-jinks or wars for tears either but it's what makes eve the game it is. change that and it makes it less which is, in the end, worse for everyone."
11/26/2010,there is a handy module already which makes you harder to scan down.
11/26/2010,no.
11/26/2010,"not supported..we had this version of salvage + get flagged at the start and the **** didn't come down in price (i remember running around belts flashing red in my small frig). if you brain-maniacs would have salvaged then and the prices for salvage would had come down so that ccp would had met it's target for rig prices, you would have it your way now.. it's entirely your fault"
11/26/2010,"ccp is resistant to the idea of making salvage theft a crime in eve. ccp likes it because it gives new players something to do that's safe, interesting and isk making. as they say, ""it was intended as a mini profession"". they've even gone so far as to make the statement that it's not theft, even though it, of course, is. just not a theft punishable in eve.it is unlikely that ccp will create a device by which a mission runner can make himself or his mission less easy to probe. first, see the above paragraph. second, ccp has made a special effort to make probing of missions easier. that's right. at one time it was difficult to probe a mission. the changes that made it easy predate apocrypha. when apocrypha made it even easier.........well now any week old player can probe you down for some nice, safe, worry free theft.shoot your wrecks. they're yours, it ticks off the salvage thieves and you'll not lose too much, if any, because you'll be running through the missions faster by not salvaging yourself.regards,windjammer"
11/26/2010,not supported. the drawback from u hiding behind concord is that they can hide behind concord as well to steal it from u with impunity. risk vs reward.
11/26/2010,"great move ccp.it'll increase people's wish for playing eve, because now it's geting easier to start. i didn't expect you gonna do it.be ready to have +50 000 players this year. but you better deal with laggs we have. p.s. you should have done it earlier"
11/26/2010,maybe as a weak long range web? having it actually move players may be more complicated gamemechanic wise..

11/26/2010,i would like to introduce the idea of being able to put your corp logo on your ships. this is a simple anof of an idea which shouldn't require a lot of debate. the second idea is player customizable skins for your ship. nothing fancy just the ability to change the color of your ship. skins would be cool but the ultamate goal is to get our corp logo on our ships:)
11/26/2010,"big fleets are already laggy, and now you wanna get everyone to start having to download 100s of skins while trying to shoot a target, get points or return to gate?come on. its a fine idea an all, but it just adds lag in battles. not that a lot of people are zoomed in during battles these days, or have effects on. bar me, but i dont really get massive lag in 100 man fights."
11/26/2010,i realy doubt that a corp logo is going to lag everyone out skins mabie harder to pull off but lets try to get one or the other with this post
11/26/2010,"french maid, barmaid, and mega maid skins please."
11/26/2010,if said corp logos would get updated at the startup of eve there would be no lag at all except form your graphic card and ccp could still add a button to turn it off any way

11/26/2010,"then wtf are you moaning about?really, so advising new folks to the game on how to optimise their skills is a bad thing?"
11/26/2010,"yes advising new people to be useless at the end of the double learning bonus is a bad thing and makes them leave the game, telling others they left because of learning skills but in fact they left because those ""mentors"" did not explain the skill system properly to them.1 attribute point with learning v gives you 66sp/h if it is a primary attribute 33 for secondary the difference between having learning skills at all v and iv iii (basic adv) is 297 sp the difference of sp the guy who only has trained the skills to iv and iii and the guy who maxed em is 1909490so the guy that has trained the skills to all lvl v would have to train for 267 days with that skills as primary and secondary (he would need even more time if he start to train any other skills) to catch up with the guy who has skipped that training and started specializing on the profession he wants to do in eve so while the guy who got the awesome advice to train up all those skills at vconclusion: you have more sp in ships/modules/science whatever for a very long time than that guy who thought that he have to train with the maxed skills, else he is at a disadvantage compared to the player who started playing eve instead of watching skills to finish, spinning his noobship in station and quitting eve at the end of the trial period because of the impression that sp/h is all that matters in eve which is not the reason to play eve.people also seem to forget that the amount of sp to fly a singe ship or do a single task you like doing most in eve is limited. you max it out and what then ? yes that is the point when you can start trainiing those learnings at higher lvls because you notice you like the game and may stay for the time it's worth to max out those learnings."
11/26/2010,"well i do understand what you are saying, and sort of agree, especially about training learning skills before skills to have fun.......which is why i think getting rid of learning skills is good.let me reread your first post when i wake tomorrow, perhaps i misread what you are saying. it has been a long day, i have been forum slapping narrow minded selfish ignoramuses all day and i now need sleep :)"
11/26/2010,"i just really want to hear this. any links to such would be appreciated. any blue posts i would love more.if i have to explain what the local issue is to a dev, then they really only look at f&i to move posts from general there."
11/26/2010,"i was just about to make this very topic.cheers, csm."
11/26/2010,could we get a list of the csm members who supported this removal...so i know whom not to vote for? :)
11/26/2010,"well, it was all sudden for me. i was ratting happily for security increse, then my friend told me: they are deleting learning skills completely soon! omgwtfbbqareusane?but hey, i will get the sp to redistibute, right? cool! i will finally get hac 5 and maybe some gunnery skill as well. you can't really say that you wasted time back then...screw this, i don't care if newbies will get their skills and ships faster. good hardware won't make them good pilots anyway. am i feeling bad? nope, i'm not angry at all for this decision. i have a 50m sp charcater, active more or less since 2007, i was buying the advanced skillbooks one by one and then train hard, but hey, everything changes, right? vets did it the hard way, yes, but now you have about 5m sp to train anything you still don't have :d it's basically for nothing, you never lost anything and your attributes will even rise a small bit if i recall.for me it's the same as align problem. i remember lessons at the academy about align and training with warping the fleet. now? we have that damn align button and suddenly it's not that 'hardcore' anymore."
11/26/2010,"this is in no way to really help the player. most players that stuck through those training times were the players that were looking for a challenge and a game that required dedication. ccp is playing the poletition card, we promise and deliver something that looks good to the gamers but back at the ranch there is a behind the scene motive.it makes sense though from a business perspective for ccp. what better way to get more subscribers. more subscribers mean more revenue.the more you can dumb down the game the more people you will attract and the more revenue ccp makes. the down side of this strategy is that your retention will more than likely be a lot less. simple business mechanics ;) soon you will be able to join a fleet and go watch tv. :sso... to sum up. game development has changed over the years from... ""we are passionate about the game we make"" to ""we are passionate about finding new ways we can make more income"".sad but it's clearly true..."
11/26/2010,"wowowow... what exactly do you mean by ""changes for our benefit""?and indeed, while you obviously don't care for ""their real purpose"" (whatever you might believe that could mean), you ought to learn the difference between ""representation"" and ""votecatching"".and please, quit lamegreening ;-p"
11/26/2010,"ok we all know macros cause a game imbalance in a number of ways. you have the mission macros which youll watch a group of ships randomly named players in npc corporation in something like permaboosted cnr's undock all at once and head to different area all at once that sells isk which all ccp can do is detect massive isk transfers, question the guy and determined if its bought. than you have the trader macro, same as above but in haulers and freighters that buy mass of one item for the day, sell it and still sell the isk. than you have the miner macros which cause even more of a market imbalance than the 2 above, they mine ore both ice and normal (ive seen them mining normal ore when ice became harder to find), sell the ores and cause a market imbalance for people that want a mining profession to make isk and suppy people with ores but has become impractical since the market decline in ore and mins. the miner macros have been the most adaptive program ive seen. when ice was in rat free zones they jet ice and a hauler comes pick it up (loved stealing the ice), than ccp took the ice out of rat free zones to 0.8 and below, the macros adapted and were made to deploy drones to fight off the attackers but still jetted ice for a hauler, than the orca came out, now they dont have to jet can it all goes into the orca which is further boosting the fleet to mine even better and they can go long rates with out the orca having to dock and the orca wont miss a cycle which means more isk for them to sell. now while i half approve of the hulkageddons little fun fair as during their time i have to mission and salvage for my isk and mins, it isnt practical to move ice to low sec than unless your in a big alliance or corp no ones going to be mining ice with out getting shot at one way or another i have this one idea.there is a game called tibia ive been playing off and on since high school freshmen year(im 25 now so you do the math), i played it straight through high school than i learned of eve and now i only visit tibia to see if friends from back home are on now and again. they had a huge macro problem, but than again when you have to take 4 hours as a magic user to make a backpack of runes (mage ammo) to go on a hunt and run out, higher end runes take 8 hours to make. warriors and paladins have to train up weapon skills which get to the area of taking days of sitting there hitting a monster to level up your weapon and shield skill, than you have that nasty 15m logout timer to where the game will log you out if your not doing anything active like waiting for mana to regen you get logged out. so yeah who would want a macro to keep you logged in, hitting a monster while your at work or alseep for 8 hours or so, so when you can play your good to go and now wasting time doing it when you can play and than have complete boredom? well over the past few years now they developed a program, this program detects 3 party programs aka macros on a players account and banns them no questions asked since its release, and its been accurate as can be, with in the first release literally hundreds of thousands of accounts were banned across all servers for macro use, all 100% accurate and the markets have balance, the game developers name is cipsoft and id say getting into contact with them would be a good first step as they to have the same problems we have on eve as many accounts were also designed to sell gold, if its enacted id say well find ice a decent ore to mine in the future, less accounts selling isk, and more people will move to the mining professions that they wanted to support the eve community in more than just having to build a ship from whats mined to make any decent money, and missioners will benefit from this aswell as salvage and mins will come back up even though the mission loots drops have been nerfed and has shuned salvagers from their profits when they wat to go in and take advantage of the missioners mess."

11/27/2010,"yarrr.. yes? did i support it yet? no idea, well, i do anyway."
11/27/2010,"go to the new forums threadintro: as far as i know, the current warp effect is at least 4 years old. i believe it is time for a bit of a visual change in that area.my idea is to replace the current ""get up to speed and slug into warp"" with a more ""punch"" like effect, as demonstrated in the following 4 videos.my first two examples are from the 2009 star trek movie:linkagelinkage - imagine a titan or other capital/supercap class ship performing the 2nd warp.my next examples are from the game mass effect 2:linkage - skip to 2:18linkage - skip to 2:10finally, it seems that ccp has almost pulled this off already in the incursion trailer:linkage - skip to 1:20since the new forums haven't come back yet, i've edited out the mechanics changes in this thread. hopefully the new forums will come back online soon.i appreciate you taking the time to read my proposal.also, keep the suggestions coming, i'd really like to see this become something that (mostly) everyone can agree on and thus get it passed by the csm."
11/27/2010,"graphic change, yes, actual change to warp mechanics, no. will this give our ships a parking brake?"
11/27/2010,i agree with this topic.
11/27/2010,"what part of the warp mechanic change don't you like?also, what do you mean by ""parking brake""?"
11/27/2010,i do want in warp speed up to go away so that you instantly get to you max warp speed once you enter warp also all the animations need some work but i'm fine with the other mechanics
11/27/2010,"i agree whole heartedly. ccp shouldn't listen to people who ***** and complain about game play mechanics changing if it improves the game overall. after all, that's what nerfing ships is about... now while warp mechanics don't have to change to implement this, it would not hurt, for the sake of immersion, if they did.we need better graphics."
11/27/2010,"i agree with both visual and mechanics changes, warp acceleration and deceleration is just an excuse for wasting our time.. the ""space bending"" effect is just awesome !!!"
11/27/2010,"i do like this idea, and it would make some cool player videos"
11/27/2010,"i fully support the change in graphic, but strongly oppose the game mechanic changes."
11/27/2010,fully agree. the change in mechanics isn't any different from how they are now. instead of align time we have charge up length.
11/27/2010,i agree with this.
11/27/2010,"i think it would be a very cool graphical update, and also a good change to mechanics.it might even accidentally fix the coming out of warp ""jigg back"" where you reach your destination and then pop backward and then forward, seeing as you would land right on your destination and (almost) stop."
11/27/2010,i think its a star trek joke. from when they first warp off to vulcan.
11/27/2010,"ah, i feel dumb now for forgetting that part."
11/27/2010,forgot to check i support this.
11/27/2010,"i do like the idea of a more punchy warp effect, but i also want spline-based trajectories to play a role. i feel this would open up more tactical options in chases and make smaller ships and t3's fitted with specialized rigs more important in catching prey.in fact i'd like to see more 'terrain' available in general (ring systems, asteroid belts, comets etc. etc.)"
11/27/2010,agreed
11/27/2010,"i'm assuming you're referring to this post of yours:plex for remap is swapping ""30 days game time"" for a remap. there's 2 ways to get a plex: buy one with $$$ buy one with isk.""in game cost to out of game benefit"" --buying plex with isk, saves you the trouble of having to spend real money to play the game. check""out of game cost to out of game benefit"" --uh, what? i missed what you are referring to here. there's character transfer fee that costs $$$ and portrait swapping that costs $$$. buying a plex with real money is out of game cost for in game benefit, you can keep playing the game, or, you can get more in game money. plex for remap is either out of game ($$$) or in game (isk) cost for in game benefit (remap).slippery slope i see. even if they open the floodgates of microtransactions for vanity items, as long as you can buy plex with isk, there's still a way to get the vanity items without paying $$$ for them.ok, lets break this down by each case here:case 1: player uses $$$ to buy a plex for a remap.plex never would have made it to the market as it was intended to be used for a remap. player trains skills at a normal rate, but benefits from being able to have a skill path that is less than a year in length.case 2: player uses isk to buy a plex for a remap.the point that the price of plexes will go up because there's a steady supply and increasing demand (now for game time and remaps) seems logical, but whose to say that the amount of plexes injected into the eve market is constant? its also possible that a sudden drop of the supply of plexes when plex for remap would go active would increase the isk value of plexes, but this greater isk value could also attract more people to purchase plex to convert into isk because of a higher exchange rate, at minimum partially offsetting the greater demand on plexes for remaps.player also trains skills at a normal rate, and also benefits from being able to remap more than once per year.seriously, what is the big problem with plex for remap? is it really the plex for remap or is it that everyone falls down the slippery slope and is fearful of microtransactions?"

11/27/2010,i would also like to see the groups window hold its position when you go to buy an item with the list instead of taking a chance on getting overcharged with the buy button in the group window.
11/27/2010,"exactly.the real issue isn't whether they allow high explosive shells or only regular ammunition, or if the cops show up in 2 seconds versus 6 seconds, but that there must be combat in incarna because this is eve, and when you're out doing something you can be interacted with by the potentially hostile universe around you. it shouldn't be that we have the real eve game, and then you can go play space barbie some. it should be eve, and then still eve in stations if you want to walk around in 'em."
11/27/2010,"you are confusing the (hypothetical) inside of stations with the (not-so hypothetical) space outside stations in eve-online. op didn't actually state there can be no limitations imposed, did he? but hey, i totally understand your problem, to some empire muppets everything that even reeks of pvp is ""pure evil""... and if you really are worried about ""you lot *****ing like a bunch of whiny teenagers"" then you should reprocess your chars and quit eve. or go back to wow. because the ""massive whiny *****iness"" is exactly what happens to some degree in a whole lot of empire systems all day long... it's called ""local"", you know?"
11/27/2010,"oh man you're so tough and cool and awesome. do you also eat nails for breakfast?i don't know if you're aware of this, but eve is a spaceship game not a gawd damn fps. it's a spaceship game that needs thought and planning because it's indeed a harsh place with few safe zones. now you want to grief people while they're fitting their ships, shopping for modules, planning expeditions with their corp mates or just taking a bathroom break? if eve's gonna be a harsh pvp spaceship game then leave me the f--- alone while i'm in my hangar.i guess left4dead is also a pansy game since it does have safe zones where you can heal and reload your weapons. doesn't matter if it makes sense gameplay-wise, real men don't care about stuff that makes sense, real men only like danger 1000000% of the time everywhere so they can look bad-ass on teh internets.no really, you log the f--- out and go put some grizzly bears in your pants, cause obviously you're drinking too much powerthirst therefore you're too energized for normal entertainment.sure, the only reason people object to this is because they hate pvp... while they're subscribed to a pvp game oh boy ain't that ironic lololol?!seriously, did you know that ****** loved pvp?it's not like skiing and protesting against snow, it's like going skiing and, at the end of the day, take out the skis and go take a cup of hot cocoa inside the lodge. snow is nice... outside... on the mountain... where it belongs. but i guess eve is too harsh and cold a place to offer some f---ing cocoa, right? real men must drink blocks of ice... recited like verses from some holy book.it never occurred to you that a game can have several aspects? don't you realise that mmos have, fundamentally, a strong social aspect? what if incarna is just to enhance that aspect? why are you all talking like every features which doesn't involve direct physical violence is some heinous crime against humanity?""well because this is eve..."" is eve some kind of sect or something?"
11/27/2010,"this thread is about eventual iterations on the game once it's no longer a spaceship game, but a game where you can be either in or out of a ship, either in or out of a station's corridors, and either playing eve in space or space barbie in stations. that's pretty clear.feel free to offer constructive advice on how the core content and core combat dynamics of eve can be kept in this new area rather than simply trying to mock people for realizing that eve is set up along certain well-recognized dynamics that incarna is ignoring. this is dishonest, as is your continuing snark about ""hot cocoa"". stop it. i've stated, very clearly, that i'm not proposing that hangars be changed at all and they will still serve the same exact function that they do now, but that the interior of stations, which have never actually existed in the history of eve , will cleave to the same dynamic as the exterior of stations. if the proposal is that you'll still have your hangar exactly as it is and nothing about that part of eve will change, and your response is ""eve is too harsh and cold a place to offer some f---ing cocoa, right? real men must drink blocks of ice.""?well, it's pretty clear what's going on, and if you're going to refrain from supporting the topic i'd at least ask that you actually argue against the topic rather than anything that lets you do... whatever it is exactly that you're doing.thanks for the free bumpage, though."
11/27/2010,"so says the man continually snarking about ""space barbies"" and calling me dishonest while he's the one setting up strawmen. eve becoming more than a spaceship game? really? oh whatever, it's getting really late. bai bai!"
11/27/2010,"no, seriously, stop the trolling and nonsense about religion and/or hot cocoa and at least argue against the actual proposal rather than this general trolling. if you support space barbie, then come out and say it. if you oppose making sure that space barbie has the core content and dynamic of eve, then identify reasons for supporting that position. but attacking tangential comments that people make while ignoring the actual proposal is simply diversionary nonsense. and quit the nonsense about any ""strawman"", as i haven't used any. as just explained, walking around in stations rather obviously does not occur in spaceships. do you really contend otherwise? therefore, it is being argued that a way must be found so that the core content and dynamics of the traditional eve spaceship game translate over into the eve station game, so that it's not simply space barbie but eve-in-a-station. that's the whole point and it's not complicated.thanks for keeping this topic at the top of the page though, but please contribute to either the pro or con sides rather than just trolling. thank you."

11/27/2010,"maybe so, maybe not. i'm convinced that the best way to see that it's more likely is to add more voices in support. also, hammering out a viable vision for what stations should be like may help."
11/27/2010,my vision for what incarna should be like is basically system shock.
11/27/2010,"system shock 2 was cooler though, and had zombies"
11/27/2010,oh lord please get over yourself.
11/27/2010,"no amount of holding devs by their toes over the fiery maw of a volcano will accomplish anything in this case. i think you have to look a little higher up the food chain. the apparent state of incarna--even the little revealed so far--suggests that no articulate vision or roadmap has been developed or maintained for this feature despite the huge investment poured into it over the last four years. sadly, without a roadmap, the risk is that incarna will be nothing but a shallow, disjointed mish-mash of mini games, microtransactions, forced interaction (to pump up selective metrics in order to ""prove"" its success and thus justify its huge expense) and (over time) fotm content that lacks integration with the greater game. with that in mind, i would rather see some evidence of a cohesive roadmap before worrying about specific game play ideas (not holding my breath on that one).even so, i'm supporting this proposal to honor the spirit of your ideas. a word of advice, though. ccp has told csm quite clearly that for proposals that are broader in scope (like this one), less detail and more ""elevator pitch"" has a better chance of provoking interest from them. so instead of dwelling on the details of implementation, it might be more useful to describe why your changes would make for a more compelling game play experience."
11/27/2010,cool story bro.
11/27/2010,"thanks for the support and the advice as well.would you suggest that i re-edit the op so that it only looks at the vision and not the specifics, or add a post on to the thread to do that?"

11/27/2010,"he wants plex for remaps because newer players need more help then they already get. . .look, i could not care about the learning skills - if anything it makes making alts a lot easier and sometimes i need a quick alt - and learning skills were a major investment in these terms.however, everyone gets the boost - so newer players don't catch up any faster and no one gains an advantage. mt is a bad trend, and if you want to see all the 'bitter vets' leave, then you will also have to recongnize that the game sorta dies with it (just look at all the great games out there that this happened to) - so eve givs a major advantage to people who have been playing longer - deal with it. at least now you can buy a character and buy as much isk as you want. . . (which we did not have btw)as for the rl money - gtc - isk issue - i agree, we should get rid of that too. . . but then a bunch of people start to cry about it and i get called all sorts of names. . ."
11/27/2010,"of course it's a boon for the vets. we're getting a huge injection of free sp that we can use to instatrain stuff that we cant remap for, meaning that we can keep right on rolling with the max sp/hr skills. in terms of non-learning sp, we've just gained an extra 1-3 months lead over a new player. as a further benefit, now it is impossible for a new player to try and train learning skills higher than us and catch up that way; the only way to differentiate your learning speed is to use implants (oh hey look, who has more money to pay for better implants?) or to stick to stat remap friendly skills for a whole year (again, far easier for a player who already has core skills trained than for a new player).in absolute terms, the learning skills reimbursement has only increased the gap between new players and high sp veterans.one could make the argument that in relative terms, the new players will get more benefit, in the same way that a $1000 pay rise means more to a supermarket checkout operator than a $100,000 one-off bonus means to a doctor, but even then, i'm doubtful. assuming that the new player was sensible, and devoted no more than 50% of his skilling time to learning skills, he'd have been on a level with the ""doctors"" within about 10 weeks or so.anyway, i argued against removing learning skills for just this reason. as usual a campaign based on ""help the new players"" is once again rewarded with a result that benefits the vets. pretty much the whole anti-learning skills campaign was based on the notion that new players are too stupid to work out the very simple optimum way to train learnings and are therefore discouraged. i also noted quite a few of the loudest campaigners of removing learnings deliberately giving the terrible advice of ""do nothing else until you have learnings to 5/5"" to new players, in order to bolster their own campaign. clever, i cant deny, if rather unethical.so the metagame was played, and once again the older players came out ahead. all i can hope for is that when people look back over this one that they'll become a little more politically sophisticated in time for the next campaign.meanwhile, i did my best, and i'm certainly not above spending my reimbursed learning sps. best of luck to the new player who fights me on dec 15th, when i'll have an extra 15% hit points because i've been able to insta-train for a mindlink. and when i say ""best of luck"", of course i mean ""sucks to be you"".see you all again for the next big forum campaign on... oh, what will it be? i think we're due another campaign on suicide ganking. there have been some older, very rich players who have lost a lot of isk to these lately - won't somebody please think of the children?!"
11/27/2010,giving a set of +4's or even +3's to a new recruit is far easier and better than dumping a pile of skill books on them to train for 2 months give or take.that so called gap needs to be there anyway... new pilots are not as good or smart as they tend to be in times past.personally i'll take this change over plex's for remaps any day.
11/27/2010,"see, now there is a proper brain at work there. nice post."
11/27/2010,i take some comfort in knowing that it wont do a tiny bit of good.
11/27/2010,"hello, bitter vet here (and even though i'm not really bitter, that's how i'm going to be judged, according to the op).i'm also against removing the learning skills. malcanis brings up numerous good points (excellent post, btw), but why should the game be made easier in the first place? im assuming that at least most of us posting in this forum figured out eventually that learning skills were useful and trained them. new players should deal with that as well. this is a game about choices, isn't it? from the very beginning (industry? mining? combat?) to the very end (supercarrier? dreadnought? pos?) and everywhere in between (high sec? low? null?), this game is designed to present the player with a variety of choices. what you decide to do with those choices helps shape your toon.but all that aside, let's say you convince me that removing learning skills is a good thing - because it takes out the complexity; because it speeds up character generation / character growth; because it doesnt scare away new players. well, why not go one step farther? lets remove shield management and just improve all shield regeneration by 25%. lets remove drone interfacing and just let every drone do its job 25% better. lets remove negotiation and get paid faster by agents.i didnt start playing this game because the choices were easy. i joined because the opportunities are seemingly endless and every choice makes a difference, even the basic choices like do i learn my next step of clarity or do i go for battlecruisers? if i wanted a straight-forward, laid-back, no challenges kind of game, id go play a platformer."

11/27/2010,"i support this idea, but i thought i'd add my own missives on the subject.i've always thought that shields should work radically differently than armor (or hull), the resists should determine how much damage passes to armor or is taken by the shield.basically a 0% em resist would have the shield ignoring 100% of incoming em damage. a 50% em resist would have 50% em damage passing through to armor/hull and 50% of it being absorbed by the shield. this would alter tanking and require a revamp to the relationship between armor and shield tanking styles, but i think overall it would be a positive change. especially if coupled with my slot revamp (rather than hi, mid, and lo slots, there would be primary, secondary, and tertiary system slots)."
11/27/2010,yes!
11/27/2010,it's never gonna happen but it'd be cool

11/27/2010,"but when the new plex for remaps was being introduced, none of this applied nor was relevant? hypocrite."

11/27/2010,"1. so new players get +7 instead of +12 as is planned, way to stick it to the litte guy!2. same as for planned change. they even reimburse the people who have been stockpiling the damn books!.3. i don't care much and usually have only +3's in my head, you probably care more and have +5. looks like the small advantage in speed you are looking for."

11/27/2010,"other then the poor capacitor, there is little wrong with mataar caps - its a choise and if you don't like it, train something else.the rep bonus is fantastic, th problem is that the ship cannot really use the bonus effectivly because of the poor capacitor - which is a mataar racial trait.so the fix is not to buff acapacitor, but to change the bonus to 5% (i think it should be 7.5& for the hel - but that may be a bit imba actually) and 5% capacitor use per levl (fo both the niddy and teh hel9. that would keep the capacitor gimped, but give it a chance to actually be a proper repper.as for the nag, considering how awful all dreads are right now due to imba moms, there is little point in changing it, but as a glass cannon it does a lot of damage - which is what its good at.if you don't like it, then train something else imo, i for one should have invested the time to train amarr - but i still fly mataar because thats what i have invested a crap-load of time into and thats what i got. . . but there are alts that do other races just fine."

11/27/2010,"again.. read the dev blog. derp derp?ccp put it in black and white... any one who has trained the learning skills will lose everything tied to them including attribute bonuses.the sp's used to train them will become reimbursed and redistributable to anything of their choice.then they will give you max bonuses as if you had trained them completely (give or take as the math is showing interesting results but the point is still valid).those who didn't train them get a buff... those who partially trained get reimbursed for lost time and balanced back to the baseline.how the hell you come to the conclusion ""it's not fair"" *based on someone else's opinions of which you claim to represent* is beyond me and everyone else here.again... you are trolling... ccp isn't going to change it and they clearly stated they don't give a crap what you think because they have been there and done it.csm has no power over this and for you to post in light of that is obviously a big fat troll/whine-fest.the evidence is irrefutable and undeniable.continue to deny it... don't matter to me any.ps: produce hard facts and evidence and i/we may change our minds... not your half assed baseless assumptions based on some joe pilots supposed opinion of which you conveniently pulled out of thin air."
11/27/2010,"first, i'm not here to argue. this isn't about learning skills, i only mentioned it because my idea is along the same lines. this is a proposal for the ability to redistribute skill points once a year.second, please don't call me a troll. i'm not.third, i read the dev blog, and i read the csm logs. i understand them, and can appreciate that ccp is hearing our voices and working on changes. it will bring new players into eve, and that's good for everyone.fourth, i'm not pulling things out of the air. i'm not making anything up, either. we are getting back our points in learning. that's what ccp said. i'm not complaining about that. what i dislike is the fact that we're not getting what we could of had if we started with 12 in all attributes. a lot of people would have way more sp if they started with ""all learning 5."" but, we can't do anything about it. they're not giving us the extra sp we would of had, and i doubt they will. eve players will live with it.and finally, please don't put words in my mouth. i never said ""it's not fair"" nor did i come to any conclusion that it wasn't fair. i just think there should be another addition to help older players.thank you for letting me clarify to you what i meant. apparently you didn't read my posts.i'm still looking for ideas and comments. thanks!"

11/27/2010,no.
11/27/2010,how much is this dumb stuff you did worth to you?would you be happy if you'd loose 50% of the skillpoints in the transfer?
11/27/2010,"how is getting millions of free sp hurting us exactly? because if that is hurting, i really like it when ccp hurts me. wut? multitasking is a very useful skill. to level 5 has kinda limitted uses, only for triage carriers iirc. but the first few levels are done in no time anyway, and pretty much mandatory for carriers and logistics."
11/27/2010,no.i really dont know where to put all the sp that ccp is going to reimburse.
11/27/2010,"the learning skills were a limitation - players had to spend the time and isk to train them, or else suck much more at whatever they decide to do with their character. that's why i support them being removed.having made a mistake in your skill training is not a limitation. it was your own choice, it doesn't stop you training whatever skills you like in the future, and you still have those skills if you decide later on to do something different with your character. in fact, i can't even think of any 'dumb' skill training decisions that would warrant your proposal.solution looking for a problem == no support."
11/27/2010,put it in the anti-troll gunnery skill.;)
11/27/2010,and what to do with all the other 5.1m sp?:p
11/27/2010,i'll take that! would be nice for my capital pilot ;)
11/27/2010,^^
11/27/2010,"like i said it sort of hurts them. all in all its a good change, but they're not getting all of the sp they could of had they started with attributes maxed. remap + all 5s + +5 implants = 2772 sp/hour. which is a little over 24 million skill points a year. few 2 year old pilots i fly with have 48m+ sp.anyways, thanks to those who have responded with input. i do appreciate the constructive comments."
11/27/2010,those 2772 sp/hour are with max remap and +5 implants. if you would want to make good average calculation then 2100-2200sp/hour are more reasonable. even that is already all learnings to 5 and +4 implants on a balanced base attribute layout. and how many people do you know who regularly pvp in a clone with +4s or +5s?:)
11/27/2010,"a few 5s, everyone else i know 4s (unless faction). the point is there are many skill points that they will not have because they didn't start with max attributes. but whatever, at least we're getting something. this topic isn't about that, though."
11/27/2010,is he talking to himself?
11/27/2010,ccp just does the same thing a different way they've never compromised on a single thing.
11/27/2010,"- nah i don't think i'm better than everyone the guys that had balls enough to tick this even though they're not caldari. not better than them i like to think we're on the same level i.e. people who stand up for stuff.- i wouldn't say it's emo, emo is wah"
11/27/2010,"you're right about this:- you didn't say you thought yourself superior, so i somehow made that up myself... but it could be (subjectively) sensibly extrapolated from the ""you all are morons"" stance ;)- ""emo"" may have been exagerated.hadn't you posted in the first place, i'm not sure i'd have bent to ""no one complains? woh, everything's perfect then!"". might rather have gone something like ""no one complains? doesn't it smell of all-too-consensual rancid air in there?"".and actually, your thread raises my morale, especially when i read those all-to-serious replies you get. i'm not saying you weren't, just that i like to watch the average passers-by make a fuss in reaction to what they percieved as a personnal insult while it was just a remark to the universe ;)regarding reaction towards boosting of caldari pvp, i don't know much about pvp but i've read stuff along how good my fellow gallentes fare at it and... well, i lol'd (at the gallentes, i mean).install the smartest person? filter candidates? who would do that? who could ""choose"" the wise better than the wise herself? that's a consistency requirement, i feel ;) how the wise comes to power, be it by way of peace or force... hers to know. whatever, i never was fond enough of plato to study that matter ;) plus i don't believe (or at least still hope) that not just every one is a plain idiot ;)"

11/27/2010,"oh, my bad.btw.. if you shoot someone in high sec (in most cases it will be those juicy afk industrials/freighters/faction-fitted-mission-boat/etc.) you're already profiteering from:1) unsuspecting targets2) no other combatants like in low/null/w-space that could shoot back3) bring alts who could do the same as the 'loot-thieves' you whine aboutif you want the loot for you alone, go to these other places and grow some balls.for me this seems pretty balanced./not supportedps: also be very carefull what you wish for. ccp might get tired of these whines and flag the wrecks from mission npc belonging to the mission npc faction (as loot from players wrecks belong to the owner of the former ship). this would also make it consistent and there would be no 'loophole' anymore. good luck with getting a flag for loot thieves after that one.. man, how would i wish that one come to tq. the forums would probably explode"
11/27/2010,"doesn't the owner of the wreck have rights to the wreck?why should the suic ganker have rights to it exactly, enabling it absolute certainty of getting the loot and removing what risk there is in suic ganking (which, seeing how its in effect subsidized by the insurance by concord kills nonsense, is artificially profitable on most targets)this would only encourage even bigger ganker camps in more locations, and act as a further buff to a career that doesn't need it.very unsupported.""but gallians what about pvp""consensual pvp already happens out of the way, and there is low and null sec where the risk equals the reward and your gang is assured loot. only ownership of the wreck and items in the wreck should be by the person who paid isk for it. irl, murderers don't get the state of their victims, neither should then in game."
11/27/2010,"let me clarify as i'm not supporting suicide ganking.what out proposal is talking about,wartargets in empire space, where you pay isk to be able to fight a targeted corp/alliance, in empire.suicide ganking bypasses this lawful game mechanic."

11/27/2010,locked by request.
11/27/2010,"to the eve community and designers, i have not been around long, so please excuse me if im off base. recently plans have been announced to get rid of learning skills, as well as put faction ships on the market order system, among others. i will not go into various ways this removes game complexity, im sure both the game designers and community understand that. i do fear that this is a avalanche waiting to happen. i feel the base community enjoy, and choose eve, because of the depth of the game. in my experience when games start to simplify, people leave. eve is still one of the more complex and involved games today so this is not a fear now, however, there is always some money somewhere waiting to fill a void. i don't think anything i say will change decisions already made, but i hope that the next thing i read isn't that implants are gone, because the newbies did not realize how useful they were, or that we all get remaps every 6 months instead of 12 because people are not patient. thank you.p.s. it would be nice if a dev responded with insurances to the community that this is not a change of principle, the game is not going through a slow simplification, and that complexity will continue to be a focus of the team. p.s.s always welcome to add more depth to eve too...."
11/27/2010,and this really should have gone into general discussion.
11/27/2010,skillgrinding is not 'complexity' or 'depth'.
11/27/2010,"to be fair, i don't see any of this as some huge evil change. i only wanted to state that it ""could"" be the start of something, not that it is all down hill from here. sorry if i gave out the wrong impression."
11/27/2010,"i'm sorry, i missed the proposal in there.nonsensical systems that impose an artificially high barrier or entry and make people quit (learnings), or that have little sense (why are certain items not on markets?) have nothing to do with depth.more like errors that shoulda been fixed a while ago, and just finally were.if the proposal is that they stop changing eve, which in my opinion is changing for the better, then not supported."
11/27/2010,"there already where several threads that expressed the same.. should have added your opinion in them, instead of posting in the wrong forum."
11/27/2010,"lol, wow rough group. it is what it is."
11/27/2010,fyi i believe ccp avoids posting in this sub forum. general discussion is a better place for this.
11/27/2010,"i'll give you the benefit of the doubt.the key to understanding the removal of learning skills is to realize that they truly are a unique case.firstly, they're the only skills which have no tangible gameplay effect. by this, i mean they don't change how well your ships operate or your standings or your ability to build things or anything along those realms. they are the only skills like this.secondly, they're required for optimum performance regardless of what you intend your character to do. it doesn't matter if you're a miner or a hauler or a mission runner or a pvper, you can benefit from learning skills. again, no other skills fall under this category.thirdly, they have a very clearly defined optimum strategy; the sooner you get them, the better off you are. some people will tell you that it's more ""fun"" to get other skills first, and those people are right, but ""fun"" isn't a strategy.when you combine these three, you end up with a group of skills which have no tangible gameplay benefit but which must never the less be trained as soon as possible in order to gain the most benefit from them. this means there's a strong motivation for newbies to learn them. but learning them is boring, so often, a newbie will quit halfway through the learning skill process. there are some people who will tell you that those newbies who quit are newbies that we don't want playing eve. those people are elitist idiots who wouldn't know their head from their ass. i have nothing else to say about them.if you consider these issues in depth, you can come to realize that learning skills are unique in that they deter newbies while not offering any interesting gameplay decisions. the choice of learning skills becomes a matter of willpower, not intelligence. this is not good game design.simplification is not inherently evil. sometimes things really are needlessly obtuse or vestigial."
11/27/2010,i approve of this comment.
11/27/2010,moved from assembly hall.
11/27/2010,"i don't see the removal of learning skills as a ""simplifying"" or ""dumbing down"" of the game so much as a removal of an nuisance and a feature that is really nothing more than a waste of time."
11/27/2010,you must be a hoot at parties.
11/27/2010,i approve this product or service.
11/27/2010,"you should, because it doesn't.i'll repost this from where you should have posted the op to begin with:learning skills did not make eve any more difficult, and removing them doesn't make it any easier. you're confusing difficulty with tedium  both of which make things take longer (or at least feel like they do), but for vastly different reasons. by your standard, progress quest  a ""game"" you leave running in your status field, is the most difficult game ever.conversely, removing tedium is not the same as simplification  both may make things require less time, but, again, for vastly different reasons. if you want an example of the difference, look at the old and the new pi interface. the new one is much less tedious than the old one, but actually far more complex and it actually adds difficulty by being streamlined."
11/27/2010,"funny you should quote that, as you're confusing difficulty with complexity."
11/27/2010,"they didn't add that either, so feel free to search/replace in that post and it'll still stand."
11/27/2010,what's complex in choosing 'the most bang for the buck' coupled with the neck breaking tedium of needing to look paint dry for the next 3 months?i really don't get you on this one crumple.
11/27/2010,"i would think very little, yet everyone insists that 1 month of learning skills is mandatory, so apparently there is some complexity there.similarly i cannot divine the source of this fiction."
11/27/2010,i think the source is reality.
11/27/2010,that's cute.
11/27/2010,i thought so too.

11/27/2010,you just ruined all the suprise...i was still getting new ones.
11/27/2010,"needless complexity - badcomplexity that adds depth - goodi think learning skills are an example of the former. they add no real depth or strategic decisions. they are an unnecessary speed bump on the way to training skills that do stuff.i don't see any loss of depth or good complexity from putting faction ships on the market, either.i love complex games like eve, dwarf fortress, etc, but i don't see either of these changes as anything but good. i haven't seen a valid defense that either of these are dumbing down the game in any real way."
11/27/2010,are you really that dumb?simplification increases playerbase which increases revenue. doesn't take a genius to figure that out. the few bitter vets who quit are irrelevant in comparison to the hordes of new players a simpler game will bring in.
11/27/2010,"learning skills and faction ship contracts aren't complex, they're just obtuse and annoying, especially to newer players.these comments remind me of the people that say everquest was hardcore and complex because you had to sit at a camp for 20 hours straight in shifts to get a chance at a drop.eve is still complex. wormholes are much more complex pve than missions, and pi is much more complex than mining. invention and t3 production is much more complex than t1 production. the game is getting more and more complex, and that's a good thing imo."
11/27/2010,"i'll post it again here. in the days of old there was a choice to train learning, or to not train learning. you would get them to say 3 or 4 and then stop (most of these came per learned with your race). some players would then spend 4/5 months for a long term advantage/payoff, while other players would go for just getting useful short term skills. and so the long term investment players would start with about 1200 sp/hour training time and slowly ramp up to 2100sp/hr (about)then one day they changed the way training worked, giving players x2 training speed for the 1st 1.6 million sp. this shortened the 5 month learning path down to... 1.5 months. much faster than half like you might think with double training speed. but then you think about the math... implants like +5, have double the effect. meaning a +5 give you +10 effectively increasing your sp/hour now let me ask you a true or false question. with the new change each point of learning takes half the time to train. false the 1st level takes half the time. but it gives you 2 points instead of one because of the double training time. so level 2 takes even less than half the time. which gives you 2 more points. and so on. meaning that old 5 month learning skill plan to increase your sp/hour instead takes 1.5 months! even shorter with those +10 implants, more like 5/6 weeks total to get to 2100 sp/hr now that's 1.5 months of getting to 2100 sp/hr, and 3.5 months of effective sp being trained. meaning that the sp you wasted into learning pays off in about 3 months, instead of 9 months/a year.so what happens to the players that don't train learning skills in the 1st 1.6 million sp???????they are ****ed royally. they have to spend 5 months, when they could of spent 1.5 months to get learning skills to the same point.in the old system it was a choice, because training early took you just as long as training them later more or less. but by making learning skills train 6 times faster if you do them early, it stops becoming a choice.i'll leave you guys with a terrifying fact.a player that does not train learning skills, but then trains them after say 6 months will be 1 year behind a player that trains them right away."
11/27/2010,"this is the same game that is adding ambulation :p won't be long before they let you add animal parts to your avatar.expect more dumbing down, and furries, lots of furries."
11/27/2010,"the game is very complex without the game getting in the way of itself.even if you start training non-learning skills on day 1, it will still take you a long time to max anything out, but you might have more fun early on. as faction ships not being on the market, that was always silly. if it ain't illegal, why can't you sell it on the market. all this does is potential limit the isk revenue of scamming ho bags."

11/27/2010,"when stealth bombers last received their fixes some time ago, we were told they would be our anti-blob tool. whatever happened with that?"
11/27/2010,"to whom it may concern:this is my opinion on the learning skill sp rebate, and urgent request to ccp to do a slight change in the rebate formulas that will kick in on dec. 14th. first of all i agree that this should be done since learning skills are viewed, by some, as one of the major parts of the steep learning curve thrown at new players. however ccp needs to seriously reconsider the rebate amount. i believe that anyone that has put in time for the learning skills was thinking long term, in terms of years, payback. i believe that the base rebate should be a multiplier of the current points. perhaps 1.2x currents sp? assuming one has all lvl5 for learning, it actually takes longer to learn them in the old system then it would with the proposed fixed attributes. so assuming it takes 3 months to learn the skills using the old system, i guess it would take 2 months with the fixed attributes proposed. so we should receive the equivalent sp that we would receive for the 3 months of training time using the new system. i hope i am making this clear. i am not sure what the fair multiplier amount should be, my guess is 1.2. on top of that we should receive a certain percentage bonus based on the total amount of current learning skill points. this is to offset the loss of the long term advantage over the people that would not or did not decide to train up the learning skills. so for example if someone had 1 million learning sp, they would get the 1.2 x 1mil + 1% of 1mil. so that would be 1,200,000+ 20,000 for a total rebate of 1,220,000 in refunded sp. if someone had 2 million that percentage should be 2%, and so on, up until 5mil and 5%. i would actually recommend having the percentage amounts higher, perhaps starting at 2% and jumping 2% for each 1mil. so at 5mil the percentage would be 10%. this whole idea behind the percentage bonus should be based on the fact that those that chose to learn these skills were doing so to have an advantage over those that didnt, on a long term basis. by leveling the attribute playing field that advantage disappears, and i feel isnt fair. the compensation percentage should perhaps be based on a 5 year outlook ? perhaps 10? ok, i am being lazy here and not making charts and doing the hard number crunching to justify myself. but i think i do have some logic in the above requests. anyone else agree? think i am an idiot? but whatever you think i would hope someone at ccp will see some of my logic here. thanks, -alex dua"

11/27/2010,"you seem to have no problem criticizing imaginary mistakes other people make, why can't we blame you for yours? your fondest wishes don't change reality. i'm not 100% convinced by all of ccp's ""we can't do that because..."" arguments, but a lot of them are perfectly valid. the csm can ***** all they want, but it won't change what the genuine problems are. we elect an advisory council, not a dev team - it's not going to be everything i could dream of, but it seems to be a major improvement on what has come before. funny story - they did stop microtransactions."

11/28/2010,supported. it doesn't make any sense.
11/28/2010,"i don't mind either way about the graphics, but the change in mechanics doesn't make sense the way you put it. now we either cannot align and hold in preperation for a warp, or else someone can ""charge up"" thier warp core and fly around and insta warp anytime??? the game mechanics change is just not practical. graphics, sure."
11/28/2010,"no, it still works the same. the ship still has to align. also, if you change direction after using ""align to"" the warp core would discharge (although changing your speed after an ""align to"" would not affect the charge."
11/28/2010,"you're still missing the effects on small ship pvp especially in 0.0 constant movement while at speed, simply changes what you are aligned to, so in pvp you can fly around at full speed during an engagement and all you need to do to pull out is to be pointed in the right direction and warp, this is part of fluid pvp, and would be detroyed by your proposed change in game mechanics. i suppose if you want all pvp to be shifted towards a slugfest last man standing sort of fight then this is just the right sort of change. so i must still maintain... suppourt for new graphics, not for gameplay mechanics changes."
11/28/2010,"i think i'm still missing what you perceive as the difference. in order to pull out, the ship must align and get up to speed. small frigates already warp nearly instantaneously, even from a full stop. since the charge time is meant to be based on the amount of time it currently takes a ship to get to warp speed, it's pretty much exactly the same."
11/28/2010,"yes to new warp graphics! (ie much faster acceleration/deceleration!) would be neat if you were decelerating so fast didn't even get a warning when you dropped out of warp, i.e. one minute you're in ftl and the next bam! gate camp! (confirming i would be most annoyed by this part, but really, right now even if you see the gate camp as you come out of warp, there's not much you can do)edit: right, supporting (conditionally of course)"
11/28/2010,"i'll support the new graphics, but the new mechanics i'd have to think about."
11/28/2010,"i couldn't agree anymore.eve needs to make itself more ""punchy""perhaps we can still keep the accelerate+ align, but once you're at that point, you go right to maximum warp, and then drop out of warp instantly, with proper sound and visual effects.the ""warp tunnel"" effect is a little on the light side so i would suggest making it a little bit more dramatic too."
11/28/2010,"totally awesome idea and i totally support, just the idea of being at a gatecamp and instead having the enemy fleet gently slide into the bubble having them all slam out of warp in a flurry of exotic particles would just be fantastic, or seeing a fleet go to warp, just too epic for words."
11/28/2010,+1 agreed
11/28/2010,"i understand what you're trying to say. since current mechanics require 75% of the ships speed, and proper alignment, if you meet these during a fight while not intending to warp, you could still warp instantly if you so desired. with the proposed plan, even having met these requirements you will still need to wait for your warp core to charge. if circumstances suddenly change and you know you now need to warp, it could be costly. i'm not supposing the op intends the wait to be huge, probably directly proportional to what it is right now, so frigates would still enter warp almost instantly, though. with some fine tuning to accommodate the frigates and fast ships which would be negatively affected by this, it could work really well. i highly approve of updating the graphics. ships enter warp at such a lackadaisical rate, this would add a little excitement to one of the most monotonous tasks in eve (travel)."
11/28/2010,eve needs more dramatic warp/jump driveness
11/28/2010,"i like this, it would look awesome, make fleets warping in much more scary.though isn't there already a skill that effects warp time?"
11/28/2010,"i'm going to support this, but not so much the mechanics changes. honestly, just decreasing acceleration/deceleration times when you're aligned and at 75% speed would probably be enough."
11/28/2010,"tentative support.when a warp drive is being charged, the ship should not be allowed to change vector."
11/28/2010,"i don't exactly understand why people prefer the acceleration mechanic to one that is effectively the same for initiating the warp, but better in other areas.with the instant effect of dewarp you can remove the delays on targeting after warp for both sides. disconnecting warp from acceleration does take away the whole stasis web trick to launch ships off faster, but there's nothing wrong with that in my book. it could also potentially lead to further ship stat differentiation with non-warp acceleration and warp drive charge time.supported"
11/28/2010,"i support the graphical changes, however i do not support the changes in mechanics."
11/28/2010,"+1 i fully support.additionally, i would increase the acceleration time to get to maximum warp giving the ships with >3 au/s warp speed a real advantage, not only one in >40 au systems"
11/28/2010,oh baby hells yes.
11/28/2010,oh yes! this is actually the most logical and realistic warp feature i could think of. it makes sense the rapid deceleration and accelerleration.
11/28/2010,pretty much this. keep the method for achieving warp the same (the game has been balanced for the current method) but have the ship just punch off/suddenly come out of warp. it would shorten warp time by only a few seconds and the effect would be so worth it.
11/28/2010,+1 for warp drive punchyness.mechanics mmmmm let ccp figure that out. would be nice feel more awesome when you click warp :)
11/28/2010,agree with both graphics and mechanics changes.
11/28/2010,"our ships ""tumble"" out of warp anyway. i don't see why aligning matters."
11/28/2010,yeah i'd love to see the acceleration/deceleration process sped up a lot. not sure i agree with everything in the op but anything would be an improvement over the current system.
11/28/2010,"please no microtransactions! i don't mind the current name change, and i think changing your facial look would be ok. (not clothes, i mean face shape)simply as if people can do that anytime they want, a ton of people would be continually changing their looks/names continually.eve is on the expensive side as it is, also there should be no game advantage from any items if the do go and do this anyway. (the only people that would want to vote for pvp items, are those that have tons of money, or suck at eve and hope you add some overpowered weapon they can just buy for real money)ps: please forgive the bad wording/structure im very tired"

11/28/2010,"though most people would like lag to completely disappear, at the current level of technology it is impossible to accomplish this. we must come to terms with this fact if we want to keep our ground-breaking single shard world. ccp are trying their hardest with 'need for speed' in a multi-faceted approach that involves upgrades to hardware as well as optimizing software and fixing bugs. unfortunately if you are waiting for gameplay in a 3000 man fleet battle to approach that of a 10 man skirmish you'll be waiting a long time. my idea approaches the issue of lag by adapting to it, rather than fighting against it.in a nutshell, i believe when the server is having trouble dealing with requests and lag is taking hold, the whole game should slow down, as in slow motion, or ""bullet time"", until it clears up again.here are a few reasons myself and others think this will be a good idea.when lag takes hold, you have to remember this is how the game is playing anyway. requests from players are held in a queue, and you have to wait a long time for your guns to activate, or to target something, or warp out. at the moment the game is not designed to display it properly in the front end, so although you can 'feel' the lag, it appears as though everything should be working. my idea just makes it more visible and therefore usable.it would give reinforcements a chance to arrive to the actual battle rather than at a standoff. this is what we all want when we are on the way and hear the targets being read out over voice comms.it would look really cool and give the opportunity for some nice fraps.the node would not crash any more, because it is taking everything at its own pace. it's like a teacher who is swamped with children saying ""alright i'll deal with you one at a time. it'll take a bit longer but at least you will all be sorted out"" rather than ""i'll deal with you all at once aaaarrrrrgghhhh"" *brain explodes*it doesn't alter any mechanics for the game itself within the slow down scenario. this keeps it from encouraging metagame ""so if we bring this many we can have x effect, we can use this!"", since all it does is literally slow the game down if it gets to a lag situation. (thanks to kabaal s'sylistha in post #2 for this one )you could play it off fictionally as space-time distortion caused by a huge number of warp drives in one place, and because the communication channels aren't as jammed, it could actually lead to improved gameplay. turn on the matrix music and slowly maneuver your interceptor between ships. (thanks black dranzer in post #3! )because the game feels like it's working properly (albiet slowly), the problem will not be compounded by players clicking many times on each command, which as we know adds even more commands to the list and creates even more lag.by slowing the game down, the server will be given a chance to handle all the requests that have been piled on top of it. where as before it would be struggling to complete them all in real time, with the physics engine breaking, and missing node 'heartbeats' resulting in player disconncetions, this way it will be able to complete them all successfully at a pace it can handle. most importantly players will be able to play the game, albiet slowly, rather than being unable to play at all.remember the most important part of this suggestion is, this slow down would only happen in a situation that would otherwise be unplayable due to lag. so a useless critique would be ""nah that'd be annoying as hell if everything was all slow"" because the alternative would be the game-breaking, server-crashing lag we are all used to. it's kinda making the best of a bad situation."
11/28/2010,"fight lag with...lag?this seems too logical. there has to be something wrong with it.unfortunately, it makes sense and is the only thing i can see compensating for lag. there's none of the silly mechanics trying to influence numbers. the only issue really is the one you pointed out about reinforcements technically having more time to arrive. it also gives ccp time for node reinforcement (not sure if they can do this on the fly, but i understand it's some possibility), and it doesn't alter any mechanics for the game itself within the slow down scenario. this keeps it from encouraging metagame ""so if we bring this many we can have x effect, we can use this!"", since all it does is literally slow the game down if it gets to a lag situation.would +2 this if i could. a lag fix that isn't a stealth ""force people to x fleet size"" thread, and would do what it intends with acceptable (in my view) consequences. holy crabcakes."
11/28/2010,"crazy but it just might work, its worth a shot no?"

11/28/2010,"thanks for the support and ideas guys. i hope you don't mind but i added two of your ideas to my main post and cleaned the whole thing up to make it a bit easier to read. if you don't want your ideas in the op i apologize, just send me a msg and i'll take em out asap! but thanks for your excellent input!"
11/28/2010,i'd love for this to be tested on singularity :)
11/28/2010,"well time is only some subjectiv illusion, if it helps playing the game better, i support this.why not, sounds logical. and time is relativ, so why not relativ to server lag ?"
11/28/2010,its making too much sense (head explodes).
11/28/2010,why didn't someone think of this before?
11/28/2010,this would be awesome
11/28/2010,totally supported. fantastic idea mate!
11/28/2010,ccp should hire the op and instantly promote him.i love this!
11/28/2010,pic says it all.
11/28/2010,"this seems like too obvious an approach for ccp not to have considered it already. but if they have, and rejected it on the grounds that the playerbase wouldn't tolerate it, then i'll add my voice to the ""no, do it"" chorus."
11/28/2010,i saw this on an iama that one of the devs did on reddit a couple of weeks back:
11/28/2010,"**** yeah!!!!there are, however, 2-fold issues with this.1.) with no ""lag"" (ie lost cycles, improperly applied dps), on the scale that alliances are able to deploy caps/supercaps, we're gonna see some scary dps applied. caps/supers instapopping every single cycle anyone? :)2.) i can see alpha getting pretty scary3.) goodbye armor rr, we can't use you anymore as you take an entire cycle to give me hp, hello shields, instant hp the second i take dmg ftw.... :)conclusion: pl/other entities who create new tactics will all start flying around in shield buffered alpha ships like machari.....oh wait...they already do nvm then....im all for it as the game will become moar playable -lord's servantps-edit i forgot to check support lolz"
11/28/2010,yes. this. would. be. awesome.
11/28/2010,"i raised this idea in a thread in response to a presentation ccp posted a few months ago, and a dev confirmed that they'd at least thought about it.found it."
11/28/2010,"with everything slowed down, u would have more time to react and start transversing since they'll lock slower in real time anyway. and since it's only the game speed that slows down, your transversal will remain the same 'cause even the turrets will move and track in slow motion. pretty much nothing that can happen in slow motion wouldn't happen at normal speed anyway. except for smarter decisions 'cause u'd have even more time to assess the situation and make your moves more strategically, kinda like speed chess, only even the pawns can move and think on their own."
11/28/2010,"i see 1 large problem in this.while time for the people fighting would slow down, other areas left in the game wouldn't. this would allow large numbers of support ships to come to the aid of the fleet in that system, inducing a metagame ""slow down the system so our reinforcements have something to reinforce when they get there.""the only solution i can see is to make the gates and cynos only allow jumps out of the system when the system goes into this state."
11/28/2010,this is suuuch an epic idea! nice work on thinking out the box!trying to fix lag by tech and speed has an achilles heel in the form of a generalised version of 'the peter principle'...basically whatever ccp does to create server headroom for fleetfights the player base will inevitably eat it up with more players! at least this will help to keep the game functional and playable untill ccp can roll in the extra computing muscle to kick the fight up a gear or two!+1 and another from my alt!
11/28/2010,"well, they carry the raw drone bay capacity, the corphangar and fuel bay, the ship maintenance array (10^6 m3 on a carrier, 2.5*10^6 on a supercarrier; all freighters are < 10^6 m3 and only carry packaged ships), and the implied support equipment for everything on the ship (capital-sized modules, fighter/bomber/drone refit and maintenance, ammo and/or torpedo holds/factories, lots of crew and crew support, jump drive and jump drive supply, divisions and controls for access to the corphangar from outside the ship, added reinforcement so it doesn't break under its own inertia, etc. ad nauseam).both carriers and supercarriers should be made quite a bit larger, actually, using the dreadnought as a basis of dockable size. you might still have to justify jumping hyperions around as a partial repackage or strapping it to the outside or something, but it's better than a machariel dwarfing a thanatos and a moros the same to a nyx :d{edit since finnegan's nitpicking and i don't feel like spamming the thread - what exactly do you call that nice plastic wrap aside from packaging for your ship, despite the not-clicking-repackage? :p}"
11/28/2010,"just a tangent, but that's not true. i routinely transport rigged ships with my charon back and forth across all of eve. just set them up in a courier contract. but yah, make supers huuuuuuge."
11/28/2010,"wow, is this eve's version of stonewall riots? how nice to see such support for us (yes, i am pre-op too) though, my feelings are a bit mixed. i am fully in support of diversity for diversity's sake. i'm not in support of diversity for fap material. that gives us a bad name and there's already too much futa/*******/lady boy p0rn out there, why add to it? i can totally go along with this if ccp were to add in normal (non-p0rn0graphic) transgendered people, like those in professional roles such as agents or npc corp ceo's as well. ffs, it's not like i'm in college to become a stripper and i doubt aamrr is either. if someone is going to portray us, i want it done right."
11/28/2010,brb moving to dodixie
11/28/2010,"with some work, this could be an excellent idea. it does mean the multi-account miners are going to be in for a hell of a run though.one of the issues with probing down mining sites is barges can't give up a strip for a probe. either barges need to have probe launchers built into them, or not need probes at all to find roids. also, think of the hell hunting down 10 minute fields would do to mining ops... perhaps offer some huge belts and some smaller ones at the same time?agreed... this is one of the most annoying parts of running a barge: having to know when to cut your lasers. and considering the ui doesn't tell you exactly how long your strips have been running (it's approximated) you still waste a lot of time even if you babysit it. galphi's idea would make this a non-issue, so there is one potential solution there.i also support the idea of comets and planetary rings offering other ways to mine both ice and ore.lots of great ideas here, and what's nice is, many of these have the side effect of making it much harder to macro mine."
11/28/2010,"been a while, so many threads have gone up for this and a few expansions later still nothing.i really hope they dont leave it out yet againedit: fixed link"
11/28/2010,"i remember ther being a post about what types of missions, and gameplay would be available in stations. but these forums are horrendous, and i cant find it. according to a ccp posting in that forum, there will not be combat of any sort inside stations when incarna first launches.as for my personal feelings on the subject?i don't think combat should be a focus in incarna- it doesn't fit the mentality of most capsuleers (rp-wise). it would be like seeing a bunch of sailors shooting each other at port hueneme. capsuleers engage in a special form of combat, one that only they can do, and it would be wrong to make all of them thugs with guns and baseball bats.according to the chronicles and back story, capsuleers are the elite of new eden, and are revered in every race, and faction. over the course of hundreds of years, we have evolved into some of the most feared people in the galaxy, and for good reason. you see, the beauty is, we capsuleers don't need guns."
11/28/2010,"cause we can crash nyxes into stations yeah. honestly though, there's something to be said for the op. an incarna which breaks away from the principles that grew eve into being awesome and succesfull, there's a fair few thoughts possible in regards to how ""well"" that can mingle. and influence the direction of eve overall as incarna gains influence as a niche of the product.makes you wonder though. what's the actual vision other than those old vids from devs saying ""uh, we always wanted 3d avatars"". that's not a vision. that's something to put on a christmas wishlist at amazon.so, supporting the discussion."
11/28/2010,why would station owners be allowing us to disembark with sidearms in the first place?
11/28/2010,"been seeing this a lot, it would appear agile scrum is breaking down in places and creating some real mindless zombie stuff."
11/28/2010,"finn, i would add the ""elevator pitch"" stuff to the op, formatting it to draw the eye. then for each ""why this idea would make great game play"", offer the implementation specifics simply as examples of how such a concept might be implemented or to clarify the intent for that idea. if other players post about things that fit the vision for your proposal, you can then link their posts with a brief bullet point as well. what a proposal essentially needs to do is build a compelling case for what it is requesting, in more ways than just upvotes. the more you can offer which does that, the better."
11/28/2010,"nice to see that the csm is having a key interest in this discussion. if they need more reasons for implementing incarna, then let's give it to them.1. depth (beyond the mini games): to avoid turning incarna into another form of ""playstation@home"", as a start i would recommend giving players at least the option of seeing their npc brokers regarding the traditional buy/sell orders they usually put up or seeing the manufacturing process of their production jobs. on top of that, maybe even allow players to be brokers or manufacturers themselves so as to further the competitive nature of eve online as players set their own rates to attract clients.2. bridge toward dust 514: we already know there is a possibility that planetary interaction might play a role in dust 514, but incarna can help as this could allow dust players and eve players to directly interact with each other (the planetary command center could serve as a gathering place between both sides). this way, both sides won't have to feel like they're being treated as a number by players on the opposite side of server. if it's possible, maybe even allow eve players to pump isk into the dust 514 economy (if there ever is one) as dust players are paid for their services while dust players can also pump isk back in eve as they pay for weapons, equipment, or other supplies.just a few suggestions."
11/28/2010,"as for the editing the op thing finn, my personal opinion is two separate threads might help clear things up. a ""we want combat in stations"" thread and ""i want combat in stations to be like this"" are going to get different votes, and as long as both exist it it will show the level of support and have design offers. unless ccp can't look at more than one thread and realize they're connected, or something silly like that."
11/28/2010,"look, i can add more and more off topic posts because i think i'm important.i don't need to get over myself. if you have an issue with what i said, explain yourself. if not, go back to your hole. or i can keep editing your quotes til you cry into your power ranger pillows."
11/28/2010,"well, i suppose if any 13-year old children are reading this you might get a chuckle out of them. 1. arrogance is generally stupid.2. instead of taking your options, i could simply stay here and continue to be amused.......by puerile statements like that. it does wonders for my self-esteem. anyways, my ""issue"" was merely that i agree with nora skuld's assessment in post #57."
11/28/2010,"oh, i missed that post entirely. of course if you agree with that then i respect your opinion less, but thanks for clarifying on what i need to address. it helps with actual discussion, as opposed to just making snide comments. snide comments are fine and dandy, but please include more than just that or there's no point. crybaby.for nora - sorry, i didn't know you loved your safe zones that much. yes, l4d *does* make itself more pansy and doesn't fit a ""real, persistent world"" sense by having safe zones where the zombies who can throw a ****ing car can't break through the strategically placed door frames. it is also a much more defined, linear system than eve and operates under an entirely different viewpoint. i love me some l4d, but it's certainly not eve.you can't have danger 100000% of the time. time can only have up to 100% of it occupied. if you want to be safe, log out. unlike some people who follow slippery slope, poorly worded arguments with backtalk that copies the style of the person in an attempt to sound kewl would have you believe, i think logging out of the game is a perfectly good time to be 100% safe.now, to throw a grenade on your paranoia.stick to secure areas. hire guards. monitor access to your occupied areas. keep some form of personal protection. just because you suck at video games when you're no longer fighting floating rocks with 3 minute timer beam lasers doesn't mean being vulnerable == dying 24/7. you are vulnerable right now. holy ****, nerf rl. you also stick to more secure areas, don't let strangers in your house, have a police force, and if you take advantage of your rights - a glock on the nightstand. you also don't die everyday.you want a game based on risk, danger, and fighting to be more secure than real life. you wonder why i think your opinion is bad, if not ******ed?edited an and to an an."
11/28/2010,"us grown ups can comment on more than one word in an entire post with valid reasoning and arguments. i choose to let the anger out because stress is physical pain from not telling an idiot that he is one, and i don't like to stress myself. feel free to do it yourself, if you can back it up with more than ""he insulted me. the insult didn't work."" ad infinitum"
11/28/2010,"true, but i'm not required to do so. but i'm not actually stressed, amused would be more apt. though we are going quite afield, apparently i touched a nerve when i poked at your somewhat pretentious style in #49? are you just about ready to move on now? we've accomplished that i think you were ridiculously pretentious, and that you think you are very important."
11/28/2010,"i like the idea, some of it will work, other parts not so much. this could open up some interesting doors for piracy and political agendas. capturing people? mugging? ransoming a prominent member of some alliance?imo, wartargets have no bearing on this; stations are faction owned and have nothing to do with concord. i'm fairly sure wars still need to be conducted outside with laser beams and autocannons. remember, adding a fps or even 3rd person over the shoulder element to combat could cause some 13 year old who's been playing call of duty and just joined the trial to wax every veteran pod pilot he comes across, which is against the general drift of the game. eve rewards planning and length of time, not twitch skills. i really like the idea of security levels or zones inside the station. they're enormous, i'm sure there are a few bad neighborhoods. getting caught doing something could have some unique consequences as well. i for one do not want to be a minmatar running into johnnie law on an amarr station. can anyone say racial profiling? honestly, the biggest reason i see ccp not wanting to do this, it would be so much easier to just sit in a station and kill people than to fly around in a ship as eve was designed for. who cares about training for the next best ship when you can cap a player with twice the sp you have with ease. if you can kill anyone, whats to stop some suicide ganker from buying a machine gun and mowing down a whole bar full of random people just for kicks. there are a lot of what-if scenarios that over-complicate the design and coding of this element, when 8 years have already gone into the space part and it still needs help."
11/28/2010,"thanks, i may go with that. i spent a couple days over turkey day vacation hammering out my ideas on this topic and this might as well stay up as an index of some suggestions anyways. i may get to work on thinking up a cohesive 'vision' for another thread entirely. although it's temping just to write ""so there's pewpew damnit!"""
11/28/2010,"the main issue from ccp's side with this could be that it would interfere with dust514 sales. when you can have the ego-perspective pew-pew in-game in eve, why care about their console game any more? not saying some people won't still get dust, but from your average pencilpusher's perspective a new feature that potentially cost your company a few bucks might look bad..."
11/28/2010,"might work if they make dust twitch play and gis third person generic targeting sort of stuff. but yah, i need to write something up for a cohesive vision. just got a lot on my plate now and it may have to wait until the start of december."
11/28/2010,"it actually just occurred to me right now that instead of trying to implement punishment style security system in stations, why not simply prevent the player from aggressing in high-sec areas by jamming their weapons as they enter the high-sec decks and corridors? their guns will then have to be taken out of the area in order to work. as for hand-to-hand fights, the aggressor should suffer a couple of days in the brig as soon as the corp-own police comes in and arrests the aggressor.what do you think?"
11/28/2010,"it's about time the drone ai gets an update isn't it. perhaps for next years expansion if we're good podpilots ;)lets consolidate ideas and propositions. personally i came up with the following list that should fix all drone issues everyone's having. it also allows for a bit less micromanaging in hot situations while still maintaining full control if desired.proposed improvements to drone behaviour. for all intends and purposes i will call the owner of the drones the 'mothership', please do not confuse with an actual mothership.drone and fighter stances:- aggressive: drones will automatically engage anyone that is or was in hostile contact with the mothership. this includes targets you previously fired upon.- defensive: drones will only engage targets that are engaging the mothership or the drones. drones will not attack hostiles/structures that had previously been attacked but are not engaging the mothership or drones.- passive: drones will only act when a command is given.sentry drones:- sentry drones now have the ability to mwd back to the mothership when command to return to drone bay is given. this can not be interrupted once command is given. sentry drones can not fire while they are returning. fighters:- delegate control: no change, however the drone stances of the delegating pilot will prioritise over the mothership.global drone and fighters behaviour & commands:- commands given to drones are absolute. this rule overrides every other rule. (aka, drones now follow commands given)- focus fire: drones will engage the same target. if due to timing issues drones engage different targets, they will consolidate and engage the target with the most drones on it.- assist: drones and fighters will engage the target the assisted pilot is engaging.- protect: drones and fighters will engage any target that is engaging the assisted pilot.- assist fleet: drones and fighters will engage targets of the fleet on the grid. (based on closest target)- protect fleet: drones and fighters will engage any targets that the fleet is engaged with on the grid. (based on closest target)- reconnect: the mothership sends out a signal in all directions reconnecting to any lost drone on the grid that originally belonged to the mothership and signalling an automatic return to bay command. grid wide effect.repair drones- ability to repair mothership. repair drone stances:- triage mode: will repair targeted ship and it's drones. targeted ship is primary if damaged, if not the repair drones will look and repair damaged drones of the targeted ship. upon completion drones return to the mothership and orbit.- cover mode: drones will engage and remain on targeted ship and continue endless repairs. drones will not switch or return unless command is given or target is dead, hehe.lets poke an example with the repair drone triage mode: (i have a feeling combinations would be asked.)flight of armor repairing drones if given the triage stance, and is told to protect fleet. (assist fleet is not there for repair drones). the rr drones will attempt to repair any ships that have armour damage, and if done, they will look for friendly drones with armour damage, and when done they will return to the mothership."
11/28/2010,really like the look of these. about time we had some drone love :)
11/28/2010,"i've been waiting for similar proposals to happen for so long i've just about given up hope. i really hope these can be implemented, and soon at that."
11/28/2010,love the ideas and its definitely about time the drones got some love.
11/28/2010,"cursed alliance alt detected.....these changes would make blobs of rr domi's the best/only way to run a fleet...not to mention one person with 50 accounts could run a fleet fight. step 1 - launch sentries/assign to fleet primarystep 2 - have one domi fit a lazor.step 3 - shoot primarystep 4 - ?????????????????????????????step 5 - instant fleet ****age/perfectly coordinated alphas/fleets.step 6 - profiti support it, but drones would have to be looked at, cause this would be a bit op with the current system :)ofc we'd see a rise in smartbombing bs fleets specifically to counter these sorts of fleets...but that would give a better role to smartbombs..hmm.-lordsedit - oh and did i mention that the domi is both cheap, and t1? if this happens i can sooo see me getting a ton of domi alts for perfectly coordinated suicide gankage"

11/28/2010,"just make it so that plex in future is 1/30th of actual value worth (1 day), i.e. get rid of that '30 day' part << never understood that to be exact.and if you want to buy plex for isk you get the used-to conversion rate.. x day gtc = x plex (instead of now: 60 day gtc = 2x 30-day plex).another cool thing possible with that.. let's say you got 25 days left on your account.by now you can only convert chunks of 30days account time into a 30-day plex.with the change you could convert as much account time into plex as you want and if there would be offers like 'colour your ship for 1 plex' you could do that.plex then would be more like ccp-vouchers...comparable to flying miles or whatever company-currency/kick-back vouchers you are used to.no need to introduce a new intermediate currency between rl-moniez and plex and isk.just use plex.isk: can be generated by ingame activity, ccp gets no rl-moniez from thisplex: can only be generated via rl-moniez and traded ingame, ccp can use this as company-currency (once locked it, ccp got the rl-moniez)rl-moniez: can not be used ingame"
11/28/2010,"plex in smaller increments than 30d would be nice, however i'm not entirely sure if one should be able to buy the plex in stat small increments. if i remember correct main reason why they dropped 30d timecodes was that it was not economically sensible for them to keep selling them bcos of transaction fees. reasonable compromise would be keeping selling the plex in 60 day chunks however, when you convert it into ingame item the amount of them generated would be bigger while amount of days per one would be smaller. ps. i do not like idea of microtransactions."
11/28/2010,"i would love to support this, but it wont happen. they get charged by the bank(s) a fee per credit card transaction. this is the reason why many institutions do not allow credit purchases under a certain dollar amount. not a feasible business plan."
11/28/2010,"over the years countless lines of text have been written about t2 bpo's in the present forums. overall there is two opposed schools of thought about those relics of the old. i will skip the arguments in here as both for and against sides have been covered ad nauseum over the years and anyone interested enough can find same arguments over and over again with the help of eve search. first school of though is supporting t2 bpo'ssecond school of though is opposed to t2 bpo'si am myself in the second school of thought. my main reasons of being opposed to them are following: i dont own one (ofc); i do not believe that their distribution scheme was influence free (a la t20); i dislike artificial entry barriers (ie only way of getting one is to get one of the current owners to sell one, there is no other reliable ingame way of getting one). last one should not be confused with general like or dislike of entry barriers - for example supercapital production entry barrier is fine, as anyone can (in theory) cross it with enough effort. while for t2 bpo no amount of effort will help you if another player is unwilling to hand you over his. invention is one of the game areas that is somewhat influenced by t2 bpo's. however influence on inevntion is relatively limited. there is no competition between t2 bpo's and invention. invention can and will (in a economically sensible way) only fulfill the demand that t2 bpo's are unable to meet (due to limited production capablities of those) putting a cap on t2 bpo profit per time unit where it is economically sensible to invent the item. my proposal is to remove t2 bpo's from the game. just deleted like the learning skills. some suitable compensation should be handed to current owners. if that is impossible for some reason then in game mechanics needs to be introduced allowing one to acquire t2 bpo in some other way than having to rely on the current owners will to sell."
11/28/2010,i will support my own proposal.
11/28/2010,sure why not.
11/28/2010,"not supported. honestly, i'd rather see them open up lotteries again but with 'loot drop' like percentages to get certain bpo's and not a hard cap on bpo's that already exist and people have to find."
11/28/2010,either provide a way for others to get a t2 bpo or take them out of the game.
11/28/2010,"hmm, better take out all those alliance tournament ships, the state raven, etc because i can't get one either unless another player sells it to me. for groan sake. this has never been discussed before. this is groundbreaking! lets see how many people who don't own one jump on this because they think t2 bpos are isk printers."
11/28/2010,"you, too, can get a t2 bpo. do what i did.there's so many t2 bpos being traded on the forums these days that i'm inclined to think that only a very small percentage of the original lottery winners still have theirs. it's simply too tempting to sell it."
11/28/2010,"you can always invent.also, removing t2 bpos will result in a rise in prices, and, making them available to purchase would also be bad.t2 bpos are a major asset to many alliancs and corporations - to remove them would be to destroy the industrial backbone of many organizations.you can buy a bpo - they usually go for 30 odd million depending on th ship/mod which equals about 3 years investment."
11/28/2010,"unique ships are a bit different thing. everyone can get one thru skill and dedication. all you have to do is to win an alliance tournament. other than sitting in your hangar and looking pretty there is no real eve use for one. they dont 'print' isk for you - even not that little amount that t2 bpo's do. as far as being fountain of liquid isk - they stopped being that with invention as possibility to invent put quite reasonable cap on profitability of one. most of them are reasonably profitable and thats about it. main thing that sets unique ships apart form t2 bpo's however is transparency of getting one. with half of eve looking you will not get some dev 'tweaking the odds' a bit like t20 did. or going and telling his buddy how exactly lottery system works so he can maximize the odds of winning one - like 'man dont use that level 4 agent, use this level 3 instead as only 3 people are using this one and you will have like 1/3 chance to get from here'.i'm not saying this has never been discussed before. i have been myself part of those discussions past 4 or 5 years by now. there are good solid arguments by people wanting to keep them as well and equally solid arguments against keeping them in game and at this point it's game design question. as factions arguing for or against them can at best agree to disagree as has been proven on numerous occasions in many threads talking about t2 bpo's.ccp has demonstrated by axing the learning skills that they can and will dump content that is not good for the game and this thread is here to ask them to take a good look at t2 bpo's."

11/28/2010,proposal is just as bad as it was the last 100 times it was suggested
11/28/2010,every current item in game should have an availability in some way excluding sales of those currently in existence with the exception of vanity items or tournament rewards.t2 bpo's should be turned into 5 years of what they manufacture too
11/28/2010,op is at least being refreshingly honest when he says the main thing he doesn't like about t2 bpos is that he doesn't have one and doesn't feel like working to get the isk to buy one.
11/28/2010,"correct on not having one part, although isk is not an issue. isk can be made with effort and getting one should not be effort free afterall. same as one can get personal titan with some effort. what is mainly rubbing me in the wrong way is that i would have to buy one from another player instead of having some ingame way of getting one. well other than hoping that someone is stupid enough to fly one around in shuttle and i'm the lucky one popping it and looting one. around as good probability of seeing that as seeing a pilot eject from state raven in front of me. although my personal preference would be getting rid of them altogether as invention is perfectly capable of fulfilling the demand of t2 stuff for the eve and that would open up some new possibilities for it (like positive me prints for example by making the initial bpc count towards quality of end product for example). implementing some mechanics to get one in game is for the case if they cant be removed for some reason."
11/28/2010,that is my standpoint as well.
11/28/2010,there is. you can buy one.
11/28/2010,"the way t2 bpo's were acquired, was unfair, but it would be even more unfair to remove them, so no."
11/28/2010,"buying an in-game item from another player playing the game isn't an in-game way of acquiring an item?oh carniflex, just when i compliment you on your refreshing honesty, you have to come out with some meretricious tat like that? edit: why not try something more creative that solves multiple problems at once. for instance, suggest a new drone npc consumable drop that increases the me of invented bpcs, in return for correspondingly reduced alloy drops."
11/28/2010,this is the reason why they were not removed when invention was added and the reason why they never will.

11/28/2010,anything which tones down this overpowered bull**** gets my support
11/28/2010,"if reasonable then ok, but since frogout supports you this will not go anywhere"
11/28/2010,"so you want a rig that buffs the effectiveness of exactly one single module type, which is eccm? you are aware that the ecm rigs you mentioned affect multiple modules, the racial jammers as well as the multipspecturm ones. heck, perhaps even the ecm bursts (not sure, cba to check, tbh)?tbh, i think you'd have more success asking for faction/deadspace eccms to be implemented. introducing another rig just to buff eccm fitted by 45% seems a bit too limited."
11/28/2010,"i would like a reverse ecm rig/module. it would make it possible for the ecm ship that is jamming me to jam itself. the jamming strength of the return jamming signal (reflected off of my ship) would be half of the one going to my ship, so if someone is jamming my harbinger with a module that has a jamming strength of 30 points they would have a reflected jamming signal applied on to their ship of 15 points.this would make it harder for one ship to shut down 3 or 4 ships in a small fleet."
11/28/2010,"i think everyone can agree that 'ecm' in it's current iteration is unfun, unchallenging, (for both sides) and either game breaking, or useless, depending on the scenario. the most common scenario i see ecm used in is in ""get-out-of-jail-free"" scenarios in small gangs, or usually by gatecamps so they can avoid similar sized gangs completely. it is a mechanic which tends to fail in fleet fights, due to ehp of such ships, or completely overpowering against small gangs. what it never is, is fun.i recommend everyone reads through this thread written by malancanis, which is a very good read and has a lot of good arguments both for and against. the overwhelming majority of people tend to agree ""ecm is horrible, but we need to give caldari specialised ships something else"". bad points about ecm- it destroys solo/small gangs, especially in situations where the targets are outnumbered.- it is an unfun mechanic, there is no skill or synergy involved. click on your jammers and pray.- the specialised caldari ships are worthless without ecm- ecm is usually either game breaking, or worthless. there is very little middleground.- the counter (eccm) is often difficult to be fit on small gang ships and solo players. eccm is also worthless when you are not facing ecm. - smaller ships, like interceptors, frigates etc. are permajammed by caldari specialised ships.- it is incredibly binary, you are either jammed and can't do anything, or you are unjammed and can do everythinggood points about ecm- it gives a useful role to players with little sp- it is useful at breaking up spider tanks and logisticsi propose making ecm reduce a targets maximum targets from 0, to 1 instead. and buffing it so that is a bit more effective on specilised ships as it is now. this will make specialised caldari ships i think that the capcitor use for ecm jammers should also be significantly reduced. - what this acheives+ people are no longer completely shut down by ecm. this will be a great benefit to scenarios as when mentioned above are used to 'get out of jail free'. this makes it much less frustrating in solo and small gang scenarios, while still being crippling.+ it also helps balance ecm against small targets (where it currently is a permajam on every single frigate except for the caldari afs from a falcon). battleships are still crippled by their scan resolution.+ ecm retains its ability at breaking up spider tanks, jammed rr battleships will have to choose between shooting hostiles, or remote repairing friendlys, it also means that an organised fleet can switch targets, and jammed battleships even reacting quickly will have to contend with their scan resolution. logistics suffer the same fate, and logistics which rely on cap transfer (basilisk/guardian) will lose all repping power all together. this role would still be a incredibly useful and game changing ability for a player with low sp. secondly, i propose moving the ecm strength bonuses to role bonuses on specialised caldari ewar platforms. this frees up a bonus. capcitor bonuses should also be scrapped to free up bonuses, and because of the earlier ecm change mentioned to reduce capacitor costs.the next thing (and probably the biggest hurdle in this proposal) is to give caldari ewar platforms a use outside ecm. and for this, i suggest replacing all the current ecm strength bonuses (which will be moved to role bonuses), with 10% optimal range and falloff to all electronic warfare (damps, target painters, tracking disruptors and ecm). this would be a nice change in making caldari electronic warfare platforms still maintain electronic superiority (through increased range) while not stepping on the toes of the other recon unique bonuses, it gives a lot of versatility to caldari ewar platforms, such as allowing them to damp or target paint at extreme ranges."
11/28/2010,"thirdly, i would increase the drone bay of all electronic warfare platforms to a decent size for that class, and would also replace any existing range or cap related bonuses for ecm, with shield bonuses. the net result is. what this would look like:the new griffin +10m3 drone bandwidth/bay (15m3 total)caldari frigate skill bonus: 10% bonus to ecm, remote sensor dampener, target painter, and tracking disrupter optimal range and falloff per level5% bonus to shield resists per level.role bonus: 75% bonus to the strength of ecm targer jammer strength.the new kitsune +15m3 drone bandwidth/bay (15m3 total)caldari frigate skill bonus:10% bonus to ecm, remote sensor dampener, target painter, and tracking disrupter optimal range and falloff per level5% bonus to shield resists per level.electronic attack ships kill bonus:10% bonus to shield hitpoints per level5% bonus to capacitor capacity per levelrole bonus: 100% to the strength of ecm target jammer strengththe new blackbird +25m3 drone bandwidth/bay (25m3 total)caldari cruiser skill bonus:10% bonus to ecm, remote sensor dampener, target painter, and tracking disrupter optimal range and falloff per level5% bonus to shield resists per levelrole bonus: 75% bonus to the strength of ecm targer jammer strength.the new falcon +30m3 drone bandwidth/bay (40m3 total)caldari cruiser skill bonus: 10% bonus to ecm, remote sensor dampener, target painter, and tracking disrupter optimal range and falloff per level5% bonus to shield resists per levelrecon ship skill bonus:10% bonus to shield capacity per level-96% to -100% reduced cpu need for cloaking device per levelrole bonus: 150% bonus to the strength of ecm target jammer strength.note: i have replaced the 5% medium hybrid turret bonus with shield resists, i feel that it is a more useful bonus, and the falcon has gone from 2x light drones, to 3x medium drones, 2x light drones, which should more than offset the damage loss.the new rook +25m3 drone bandwidth/bay (50m3 total)caldari cruiser skill bonus:5% bonus to heavy and heavy assault missile launcher rate of fire per level10% bonus to ecm, remote sensor dampener, target painter, and tracking disrupter optimal range and falloff per levelrecon ship skill bonus:5% bonus to shield resists per level10% bonus to heavy assault & heavy missile velocity per levelrole bonus: 150% bonus to the strength of ecm target jammer strength.the new scorpion +50m3 drone bandwidth/bay (125m3 total)caldari battleship skill bonus:20% bonus to ecm, remote sensor dampener, target painter, and tracking disrupter optimal range and falloff per level20% bonus to ecm burst range per level5% bonus to shield resists per levelrole bonus: 75% bonus to the strength of ecm target jammer strength.the new widow +50m3 drone bandwidth/bay (125m3 total)caldari battleship skill bonus:5% bonus to cruise and siege launcher rate of fire10% bonus to cruise missile and torpedo velocity per levelblack ops skill bonus:5% bonus to shield resists per level25% bonus to cloaked velocity per levelrole bonus: 150% bonus to the strength of ecm target jammer strengthnote: i didn't give this ship an ewar optimal range bonus, mostly because it seems the shield bonus would be better suited to its role."
11/28/2010,"this results in, making the caldari specilised recons more front line, the extra drone bay makes them do semi-decent damage, and provides them more offensive and defensive support against hostiles similar to that of other recons. the tank bonuses help give the ships more direct combat ability, as well as helping to take away their fragileness. the increased range to all ewar types option gives a niche to caldari ewar platforms and to fit different types of ewar and work at more effective range, giving them more versatility and allowing them to fill more ewar roles, without stepping on other recon toes. the scorpion still maintains its role as the king of range ewar, while also gaining the ability to go toe-to-toe in a more direct combat range, and gives the caldari more of a solo bs similar to other t1 bs of the other races. i believe this is a suitably replacement for ecm going from 0 to 1 target (which is still incredibly effective at shutting down other ewar platforms, and remote logistics). the drone bonuses also give caldari pilots something more worthwhile to use drones for (partilculary heavys in the case of the scorpion). eccm is still useful, and will still be needed on logistics, remote repair battleships, and electronic warfare platforms. i think this would make ecm a lot more fun, and strategic, and also give the caldari specialised ships more direct combat capabilities, as well as increasing their ewar options. tl;dr: ecm and electronic warfare drones reduces max locked targets from 0, to 1.all caldari specialised platforms gain additional drone bays (appropriate for their class)all caldari specialised platforms gain tank related bonuses, 10% optimal range to all ewar types, and their strength bonus moved to a role bonusecm cap use is halfed."
11/28/2010,"anything else you want? perhaps nerf effectiveness of all other racial ew by 50% flat? how about looking the word ""balance"" up in a dictionary first? some people... no, just no, kthxbb."
11/28/2010,"i generally like the ideas that make jammed ships not totally useless. i had proposed an ecm change a while back were the jam dice is rolled independently for every lock (or lock in progress) of the targeted ship, so it would just reduce the target selection, like sensor damps also do, just based on chance, not range. this goes into a same direction.of course, proposing ewar bonuses other than ecm for caldari while leaving the other races out in the rain is unacceptable.except for the suggestion for a bit more tank all the other proposed buffs are completely out of whack, so not supported."
11/28/2010,"boring fix, from how i read it. ecm is one of those things that is so hard to touch because with the nature of it you either nerf it to uselessness or have it too op. currently it is more on the op side, but has a few things keeping it from being too far gone.the 0->1 fix will either be effectively the same, or a drastic nerf. for larger ships, if the 1 target remaining isn't the most important they might as well have 0 targets. if it is the most important, you feel the effects of it at a significantly lower level.the idea of removing the range and giving drones doesn't sit well with me. i don't want to switch to a gallente weapon system focus. ecm (and ewar in general) needs more variety when it comes to range as it is. i can't really see a bad thing to making ewar boats sturdier, but that is a purely biased opinion and i'd rather someone else comment on it.fixing ecm itself involves removing the random aspect, having varying levels of effect, and (imo) altering it to one ecm line with scripts. 'reloading' every target switch would be bad enough, having to go refit is silly when there isn't another ewar system that necessitates refitting when you intend to use the same type of ewar.as for messing with the randomness, variation, effect itself or what have you, the nature of what it's designed to interfere with makes that a tricky proposition as opposed to how clear cut things like the module issue are with it. making it not 'remove' the locks but 'hide' them for the duration so the ships don't have to relock is one of the more common common sense suggestions. my own personal idea was that it should negate the effects of the ewar of the target."
11/28/2010,"i would appreciate it if you would reply with something more constructive. i have spent a long time thinking about these changes. and would prefer it if you at least spent your time discussion it rather than using a roll eyes smiley and a straw-man argument.lets look at some of the changes i have made to various ships.the griffin, which is arguably the strongest change i suggested.it now can do an additional 59 dps with hobgoblin iis (47 with warriors), it has gained just under 1000 effective hit points, assuming it has a medium shield extender ii fit, a bit under 1300 with shield rigs. if it had no tank, it would gain a whooping 300 effective hitpoints. i fail to see how this is game breaking, it does a bit more damage, it is a bit more harder to kill, it's not going to soloing rifters or any combat orientated frigates, and solo bait-fit griffins which relied on ecm actually got nerfed. the 10% optimal range bonus is not that useful on the griffin itself.i think those changes are reasonable, well thought out, and componsate the griffin fairly. i am of course not a game designer, the only experience i have is playing this game for nearly 4 years, and being one of the top ranked solo pvpers in this game. so my changes could well be flawed. i'd appreciate it if you could constructively argue with me, and provide a reasonably example of where these changes would overpower the ships."
11/28/2010,"i was expecting more resistance from players who actually thought i was nerfing their playstyle than from people who would think the buff is too strong. i agree that the all electronic warfare optimal range bonuses is a little strong.maybe i should reduce it or get rid of it entirely? i just thought just drones and just tank would be a little on the weak side of replacing total lockdown from ecm. it's nice to see lots of peoples opinion on ecm, and how we can change it, so if nothing else comes from this proposal we can at least have a decent selection of opinions and ideas."
11/28/2010,"i approve of the 0->1 idea as this would allow soloers who are falconised to still kill whatever is tackling them and escape and remove the get out of jail free card for people who use falcon alts.however i think giving ecm boats bonuses to all ewar is a tad on the silly side, as is the drone idea, especially with ecm drones as broken as they are"
11/28/2010,"good idea with 0->1, ecm needs to be looked at"
11/28/2010,"i wholeheartedly agree that ecm needs a thorough once-over to bring it back from the current ""either op or meh"" place it is nowif you are going to add firepower and utility and tank to all the ecm boats then what are you going to trade in?fittings? capacitor? mass/inertia?if they truly are to be the pinnacle of ewar platforms then there has to be a crippling side-effect somewhere.i would suggest a doubling/tripling in cap use of ewar modules (ie. not reduction which you also want) to make the one ship incapable of shutting down an entire gang as it is now. if people want ewar they should have to sacrifice the pilots/dps to achieve it.example: ecm boat should not be able to run more than 2-3 modules with a mwd fitted for instance. they are of course free to augment cap through injection/mods) thus sacrificing survivability.combined with tank/dps increase this should balance out nicely as the power inherent in the ships now comes at a cost. tit for tat, its the eve way (angels exempted).will still scale horribly and be useless on fleet level (like all ewar), but the ten-man gang will no longer be wiped out by the five-man who just happened to have a single bb/rook/failcon available.by the way, what about eccm? what role will it play in this new world of all ecm boat gangs you envision?you correctly mention it being difficult (""hah"") to use on small-gang/solo ships and that it has no benefit when not actually facing ecm, unlike all other counter modules .. a lot of the solution may be in adding to eccm rather than ecm + platforms:one guaranteed locked target per eccm, and/or weapon sig.res./exp.vel. improvement, and/oretc."
11/28/2010,"not 100% on the changes suggested, but support the proposal in general."
11/28/2010,word homie
11/28/2010,"i dont care how its done but ecm is ridiculous against solo / small gangs and as you say becomes less and less important against increasing numbers.it is un-fun whether using it or having it used against you, and it derives its benefits primarily from chance rather than thoughtful use.supported."

11/28/2010,"under your system i can jam someone and they can still lock me and kill me even without eccm fitted.no.under your system ecm boats lose the disadvantage of being made of tissue paper while also having ecm ships gain a helluva lot more jamming strength than they currently have, or keeping their strength the same, while also gaining massive range.eccm needs a buff to make it useful outside of an ecm situation (i like the guaranteed lock idea) but as it is, its stacking strength (particularly the stacking strength of remotely-projected eccm, and yes, that does get used) increases peoples' sensor strengths massively, rendering ecm virtually useless against that target after the second eccm. your complaint that eccm is hard to fit on ships is also invalid, considering that it's hard to fit a lot of things on ships and one of the focal points of eve is that you can't have it all (at one time, anyways).you also make the assumption that everyone has the same sense of fun or enjoyment as you and thus apply your ideas of fun to ecm warfare. welcome to eve; this is not the case.frigates being permajammed or nearly so by specialized ecm boats is how it's supposed to be. keep in mind that in order for that to happen an ecm ship has to get its jammer strength up with mods, thus reducing tank even further.the entire proposal works out as a major buff to caldari ecm warfare, with no bonuses lost and many advantages gained./shameless hijackingboost base sensor strength on all ships by 2-3 and nerf (yes, i said nerf) eccm strength by 25% while making eccm modules guarantee at least one lockable target at all times. leave existing ship stats besides the sensor strength alone. before you cry that this would make eccm useless, remember that it stacks almost exponentially under the current mechanics.there. frigates (and other ships, which also could use it) get a boost, eccm is worthwhile to fit but not op, and solo-pvp lives on. oh, and logistics would still be able to target someone but they would have to either stick with their cap buddy or repair someone, but not both (unless it's their cap buddy, and cap buddies don't have dps)."
11/28/2010,"so is it that you enjoy being jammed or that you enjoy jamming others? given we all have our different ideas of fun.but aside from that i like your changes to the eccm modules problem is they are still a big sacrifice to a fit i think, and esp if you are going out soloing.second edit: btw you only need to look at the other forms of ewar to see how ridiculous ecm is atm...please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
11/28/2010,"you probably missed his main change to ecm mechanics alltogether (which would easily justify boosting dedicated ecm ships in other ways) and posted without reading the thread, right? dimwit.oh, i'm not in 100% agreeance with the op but the basic idea of always being able to lock 1 target is magnificent and would be a badly needed gesture towards the solo and small gang communities. supporting this."
11/28/2010,i hate ecm as it is
11/28/2010,"the more i think about this, the more i like it. makes ecm more effective as a genuine force multiplier but stops it from being completely debilitating against small gangs/soloists/frigates."
11/28/2010,i concur
11/28/2010,no way i'm going through all this again. have fun and let me know how it turns out.
11/28/2010,"i like it.i think giving the scorp a resistance bonus on top of her 8 meds is to much if you use it without ew mods.something like the brawler scorpion that was on the table during the last ecm changes, would be more reasonable in my opinion as heavy ecm platform that fits well in heavy gangs.this would require a rof bonus and another low(best taken form the high slots) and a higher ecm strength instead of range.edit, forget to support."
11/28/2010,"i don't agree with the details and most of your ship rebalancing, but i agree with the idea in general and the 0-->1 target locked is a good idea. the ecm ship should normally be sitting well out of range anyways, so that change won't threaten it."
11/28/2010,supporting- gob
11/28/2010,"on the whole, i agree with the main ideas of the proposal--ecm is overpowered and in order to balance it, the ships that use it need to be rebalanced with it.i read another thread a while back about an ecm change proposal that involved gradually reducing the number of locked targets down to 1 based on how many ecm mods the pilot is using on one targeted ship. in this proposal, there would also be at least one guaranteed target lock. overall, the proposal made sense, but it left the ecm pilot's ship too underpowered for the difference in its ewar effect. i, for one, would gladly trade giving ecm pilots more dps and some more tank if it meant i could have at least 1 guaranteed locked target. the bonuses to other ewar, however, i cannot support even slightly.here's something else that may be worth adding to the balance issue: the first 2 or 3 seconds of a successful ecm lock, besides having the ability to bring down the number of locked targets to 1 if there are enough ecm mods, will hide all locked targets from view and usage. at the end of those 2 or 3 seconds, the lock(s) are reinstated as if nothing happened--besides the locks that are being negated by ecm normally.this will still give at least a brief window of opportunity for someone to escape if that is their goal, but not be game-changing in its effects in pvp for the most part."
11/28/2010,"i really like the 1 target maximum idea while boosting strength which will make it great vs rr etc gangs and useless at raping soloers (yes you can use a lot of other things to protect tacklers. tds are very good at it and not random)the boost to to other ewar might be too much if you want falcons to be as good as other races recons but fine if they are supposed to be the best ewar platform, will also make flying them a lot more fun as you will actually have lots of tactical choices in how you hit f1-f8"
11/28/2010,"fail at reading comprehension 101 much? i didn't state i wasn't in ""agreeance"" with ecm in need of some looking at. i did state though that the details of the proposed changes are a major balance issue. or more like: ""f*** inter-racial balance, let's buff caldari e-war ships!"". and to the op...i could care less. i happen to remember you trolling providence under cva ""management"" for miner and ratter kills tho back in the day, so spare me. get over your ego issue and wave your e-peen in someone else's face, k? i don't even bother to check battleclinic stats personally, yeah, so whatever gives you a woody...oh yeah, 59 extra dps on a t1 frigate hull is totally negligible. as is about 1k extra ehp. who you think you're kidding here? the griffin has supposedly (by game design) the role as a cheap ew frigate, not a heavy hitter. but hey, for the sake of theorycrafting, let's proceed on your path of changing ew for the lolz. let's see... how about changing the amarr pilgrim in the same spirit? hm, i give up the td bonus, heck, i graciously even forsake the option to fit tds at all on it. after this epic sacrifice i want in exchange:- doubled drone bay size- 125m<U+FFFD> bandwidth (5 heavies, kthx)- 2k extra armor hpyeah... right... hope you enjoyed the show, please come back for next week's issue of ""eve is about solopwnmachines""..."
11/28/2010,"lol a ""heavy hitting"" 70 dps / 4k ehp frig... good one."
11/28/2010,"mate it does almost as much dps as a maulus now, that thing hits like a friggin truck!"
11/28/2010,"right, way to drag it out of context. not mentioning that the context was a t1 ew frig hull is pretty pro. but hey, i'm totally positive you guys fly 150+ dps t1 ew frigs all the time, right? you also solo titans in your rifters, right? must be why your excuses for a corp dominate all of eve! oh... wait..."
11/28/2010,"i have done the research, and they said they were bringing them back. just making an effort to gently nudge ccp to remind them that this is still a wanted effect"
11/28/2010,"i would like to see target painter bonus for mimi ships switched to tracking disruption bonus instead.mimi aside from the phoon do not use missles, nor are we the missle race. mimi is about speed speed and more speed. please change bonus to tracking disruption. i think it would be a far better fit."
11/28/2010,i'd like the sensor dampening from gallenteans to be replaced by webs.that also won't happen.
11/28/2010,the increased signature also helps you getting better hits with guns. sigradius is part of the tracking formular.not supported.
11/28/2010,"you are aware that tracking disruptors are the amarr racial ew? so with you proposed change... in exchange you would dump the target painter bonus on the amarr ships? or what? right, because amarr are widely know as the proliferate missile-using race..."
11/28/2010,"i think the current sun occlusion is dreadful. i mean, the star seemingly shrinks when an object goes in front of it. this is fairly unrealistic. this is even more noticeable when you warp to the star and position your ship correctly, the whole star still seemingly vanishes!i propose this: make the star glow shine from behind the ships even when it is fully occluded. it will just look so much better in my opinion."
11/28/2010,"i know there has been a lot of discussion, especially recently, about the learning skills - i.e. they are a waste of time, they discourage new players, they are irrelevant to game play, etc. while i agree with these observations, learning skills also fit the overall premise of eve in that you have to plan your character to be effective. the real problem with learning skills is that once you have them trained, besides allowing you to train other skills faster, they truly are irrelevant to playing the game. ccp's solution to wipe out this skill set, though it is about as equitable as possible, especially in the timeframe given to get it done, has an underlying effect of basically making eve easier. a new player comes into the game and just starts training skills without any conscious effort given to the future of that character and at the same time, everyone who has these skills trained, gets a massive influx of skill points to assign however he or she wishes thus immediately making them stronger. the fact that the vast majority of players here in the forums are ok with this (or more precisely, applaud this decision) truly amazes me since most of them are usually against anything that would make eve easier (the dumbing-down syndrome).my proposal is this...instead of completely and irrevocably wiping-out the learning skills set, revise each of the skills so that they become relevant. instead of just being used to increase your training times, add a function to each of the skills that effects an aspect of the game relevant to the skill. as an example, the learning skill itself, in addition to increasing all training times, could add an extra amount of time to the skill queue for each level trained.examples:learning skill - increased queue timeanalytical mind - bonus to all scanning resultslogic - bonus to target acquisition (similar to motion prediction but affecting all targeting)instant recall - slight advantage in games of chance (incarna)eidetic memory - extra jump clones &/or ability to rename/alter a jump cloneiron will - bonus to ship resistancesfocus - bonus to response timesspatial awareness - bonus slot on one ship per level or permanent bonus to cargo/drone capacity per shipclarity - increased maneuverabilityempathy - bonus to faction standingspresence - lower base price on goods from npcs (including incarna npcs)please note that the above examples are merely that, examples of what could be done with the learning skills. i am not suggesting that those specific bonuses be used although they could be, perhaps with modification. the point is, why make the game easier with a quick, knee-jerk destruction of an established game mechanic when the skills could be made useful and enhance the game. it may take a bit longer but in the long run everyone wins."
11/28/2010,supporting my topic (always forget to do that. o.o )+1
11/28/2010,"so your solution is to make them even more required, therefore increasing the problem?"
11/28/2010,no. if you want new skills propose new skillsthese names must forever be wiped from new eden.
11/28/2010,"how does this increase the problem? the main reason everyone hates learning skills is that they add nothing to game play while requiring their training in order to keep up with everyone else. by giving the skills game-play relevance, they would no longer be a waste of time. you would gain the decrease to training times while also gaining bonuses to actual game mechanics and features. this doesn't increase a problem nor does it dumb-down the game by eliminating the need to actually plan your character's path.they would be no more required than they are now, but by training them, you gain immediate benefits just like any other skill in the game. where's the problem?"
11/28/2010,"i have to disagree. a lot of the suggestions that you gave such as bonuses to jump clones, targeting, etc. are already provided by other skills outside the scope of the learning skills. and besides, the majority of the players feel that the learning skills are the main reason why new players get so easily confused about how to manage their training. i have played for well over two years and yet i only have 800,000 total learning skill points. i honestly didn't need them anyways to be able to train for the hulk, blackbird, ecm modules, mining modules, t2 turrets, etc. in fact, as training time went by, i really didn't care for training time anymore. it's gonna take me 34 days of training to cruisers level 5? pfft... whatever, start the training."
11/28/2010,and the current learning skills don't have immediate benefit?
11/28/2010,not as far as actual game play is concerned.
11/28/2010,"as i stated below the list of examples, these were just examples of what could be done. i took them off the top of my head. with some serious thought (like a dev team's brainstorm session) the skills could have added bonuses that either enhanced already existing skills or added to areas that are lacking. my examples are not suggestions per se, just an indication of what could be done instead of just erasing them from the game."
11/28/2010,"why not let learning skills die, but then add a bonus attribute to other skills? like evasive maneuvering 5 also gives you 5 pts in perception.it's an absurd idea. just let it die. learning skills are goners and no amount of silliness will bring them back."
11/28/2010,"my god. what is wrong with this community. if someone suggests a proposal or idea that goes against the general consensus of the forum population, immediately the idea is silly, stupid, a troll, ludicrous and absolutely without merit. if you don't agree with it just say so. or even better, in a mature fashion, explain why you are against it and perhaps have an intelligent discussion. the vast majority in here are so closed-minded they couldn't or refuse to see anything good in an idea if it is in any way different than their own perception of what should be or what they want.like it or not, the learning skills could be saved and have a very positive influence on the game and everyone would benefit without the game losing a mechanic the loss of which essentially makes the game easier. of course the proposal is probably too late and unless the majority in here suddenly decided to open their eyes and forget for a moment that they hate the learning skills as they are now and voted for this proposal, it will vanish into the plethora of other proposals that just faded away. but my deciding to submit the idea here is no more or less silly than any other and probably has more merit than most."
11/28/2010,"your idea is just bad that's all, since it doesn't fix the original problem and just makes it worse. everyone with a working brain who isn't looking at his own bellybutton can see it clearly. this is why your idea won't ever get much support.learning skills are just bad game design, don't add to the depth of the game and needlesly discourage new players from continuing to play the game. the desision to get rid of them was made long ago. all the serious discussion has been about how it should be done, so it causes the least amount of harm to the people who have trained them and doesn't make training too slow. any idea that keeps training skills in any form won't be considered seriously at this point. i'm sure you think your bellybutton is amazing and people just don't get how amazing it is, but no, it is a disgusting hole full of lint and grime and you should wash it more often.needless to say at this point, but i'm not supporting your idea."
11/28/2010,"pretty much no one wants them saved, they are an abomination that should be gone forever.they will stay an abomination as long as they are required to be trained in the beginning, which they will also be in your proposal.if you think pressing the button to start training learning skills is hard, then i got some bad news for you."
11/28/2010,"tedious does not equal hard.removing the learnings makes the game better. everyone hates them because they are terrible in all the ways something can be.let them die, the more painfully and the brighter the flame of the fire they burn in, the better."
11/28/2010,"malcanis' law: whenever a mechanics change is proposed on behalf of ""new players"", that change is always to the overwhelming advantage of richer, older players."
11/28/2010,"your proposal indicates a lack of understanding.the issues with learning skills are multi-faceted. the fact that they have no gameplay affect is one of the aspects which makes them obnoxious, but it is not the aspect.what you suggest is buffing learning skills.this would serve to marginally ease the boredom inherent in training them, but it would encourage their training far more than before, effectively amplifying the problem.can we please just let these things die in the ass without a whole lot of kicking and screaming?"
11/28/2010,yup. exactly. i'm not even gonna bother answering the rest of them (especially the child with the belly-button fetish and an apparent iq half the size of her age).
11/28/2010,"name-calling helps your agrument. true story.anyway, this ""solution"" makes the problem worse. previously not training these skills was shooting yourself in the foot. with these changes not training would be more akin to amputating a leg.just let learning skills die and let me have my +12 attributes please.not supported."
11/28/2010,"well, as you can see, the general consensus is that the learning skills are no longer useful to us (if they ever were useful at all)."
11/28/2010,"only if they can be fired by really big ships. suggestion... let's call it the ""fotb missile"" (fortb obviously stands for ""f*** off terrible blobbers"")- light fotb missile to be launched only by dreadnaughts- heavy fotb missile to be laucnhed only by supercarriers- cruise fotb missile only to be launched by titansoh, and make the launchers for them only mountable on caldari ships. and ammo price like 1 isk/missile. thereafter we can sit back and have a jolly good laugh at what goes for ""balance"" these days..."
11/28/2010,"seriously, what makes you believe that such a weapon would be a good thing?"
11/28/2010,it would stop blobs from existing? this is a good thing.
11/28/2010,i think these are long overdue and would help add more counters to the currently very few working ones for ecm.
11/28/2010,four threads about ecm nerfs? did a falcon kill your parents?supported only because i like missiles.
11/28/2010,"i am amarr, but i really like missiles. put some love into the more or useless fof missiles, they are not used much anyway."
11/28/2010,maybe we should add fof crystals too...stop trying to fix ecm by changing something else... just nerf it so that its on par with the other ewars.

11/28/2010,"first , the bounty system- bounties is no longer a single pay-off. instead, an amount from the total bounty on a player is now placed on the ship he flies in. for example, frigate would be 50k, cruiser would be 1m, battle cruiser 10m, and battleship 30m. such bounty will only be rewarded if the person destroying the ship has in his possession the original kill right or a licensed version of it (see kill rights below).so, if a player has 100 million bounty on his head, and he flies out in a battleship. he comes under attack, and lost his battleship. if the aggressor has a a kill right or licensed version of it in his possession, aggressor will gain 30m in bounty much like how npc bounties are distributed, and the player which the bounty is placed on now only has 70m left on his bounty. however, if the aggressor does not have kill right or its licensed variant, no bounty will be reduced and aggressor gains no bounty. if multiple aggressor with kill rights are involved, the one dealt most damage will get the bounty.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------second, kill right overhaul-- kill rights can be traded, contracted and will not expire. it now has additional options players could choose. a 1-time bounty placement option (ie, you can only place bounty on the person once), a destroy kill right option, a ""license"" kill right option.one time bounty placement is self explanatory. however, podding-related kill right will automatically have it's bounty doubled.destroy kill right option will eliminate all bounties on the target's head. so, if the target cannot bear the bounty on him then he can offer isk or other ways to back the kill right and destroy it.licensing kill right, ie, making copies of it will have a limit of max 5 copies and invoke a cool down timer of 1 month (or maybe 2 weeks). before the timer expires you cannot make more licenses. unlike the original kill right, which only dissapear if destroyed or all bounties are gone, licenses are 1-aggression only. appreciate feed backs, will keep on update in the 1st and 2nd post if good feed backs are given."

11/28/2010,"aww. poor winmatar pilots are sad cuz their fotm nanoships don't have the capital microwarpdrives they need to kite.don't worry, they'll come out with an angel cartel supercarrier and make it all better...(seriously, the minmatar aren't supposed to have good capitals. they're a speed tanking race. for hold-the-line-pew-pew, fly amarr.)"
11/28/2010,racial 'signature traits' predate capitals.
11/28/2010,furries are a plague and they ruin everything they touch. ban furries!
11/28/2010,"its not simplification its fixing something that was stupid, the boost of attribs will reduce learning times across the board... thats what learning skills didlearning skills were just additional grind and a time waste for players...and the biggest reason was stupidity...you cant learn about learning faster!"
11/28/2010,you shouldn't really call it simplification because that suggests that learning skills added 'complexity'.what they actually did was make new players go 'it's going to cost me 15 dollars and at least a month before i can even start to do things? i'll go pound nails through my **** instead.'
11/28/2010,"yup, it's a complex choice to make: do it and get increased training speed, or don't do it and get left behind.real hard choice. assuming you are really damn hungry that day, it's sort of like getting one burger for $3 or two for $3.25; there is nothing complex about that choice."
11/28/2010,it's for moments like this i made these.
11/28/2010,"learning skills are a prime example of fake difficulty. fake difficulty saps the fun out of the game by creating a barrier to progress in the form of withholding critical information or wasting the player's time; in eve, this exists on top of the abundant content that already requires a guide book just to learn properly."
11/28/2010,learing skills made you progress faster.
11/28/2010,not while you are training them.
11/28/2010,no skills do anything while you train them. shall we remove them all?
11/28/2010,"once you were past the barrier.incidentallythat's also why they made little to no sense. a huge part of the argument for keeping them is based on the ""i got them to skill better than those who didn't get them"" line of thinking, which falls into the exact same trap. if there is no race, and just a matter of getting the training over with a bit faster, the best solution would be to make everyone train a bit faster."
11/28/2010,"nah, just the ones that do nothing in themselves and work only as a speed bump about.. say 5 months long to actually playing the game."
11/28/2010,there is nothing about this that isn't wrong.
11/28/2010,"thats just like, your opinion man.it would seem that most of the playerbase, ccp, and reality would disagree with it. but hey!"
11/28/2010,"your right there isn't.the problem is it doesn't take 5 months if you do it in your 1st 1.6 million skill points.it takes 1.5 months. and then if you didn't train them at 1st, it will take 5 months down the line."
11/28/2010,i've seen this somewhere before.
11/28/2010,"seems familiar, doesn't it?still like the sigs."
11/28/2010,<3
11/28/2010,"crumplecorn, for a person who's claimed indifference to learning skills removal, you sure do make a lot of posts in favor of the opposition.just saiyan."
11/28/2010,ur dum
11/28/2010,"then i would suggest that, since the learning skills were there first, that the initial training bonus is a poorly designed addition.i am fairly indifferent to their removal. but have you seen how many threads aren't about the learning skills? not many."
11/28/2010,you could always make a thread thats not about them!
11/28/2010,"my emphasis was on ""in favor of the opposition"", not ""a lot of posts""."
11/28/2010,but then what would i make it about?well i always pick the side who is right.
11/28/2010,beats me.
11/28/2010,"how about how silly it is that, with the new keyboard shortcut defaults, w is not mapped to ""warp to""?"
11/28/2010,it's not? wtf is it mapped to then? i figured this would be a given...
11/28/2010,"can't remember if it's approach or orbit  probably approach, since you'd expect that one to be mapped to a, and i seem to recall that there were a few other wtfitudes about those mappings."
11/28/2010,"well if you believe one side is right and one is wrong, then you're not indifferent, are you?"
11/28/2010,i hear google-ing your skill order is depth.
11/28/2010,"exactly!i'm for any change that get rid of the issue though, i'm a nuke it from orbit kinda guy.but yeah learning used to be fine, rawr ccp.meh"
11/28/2010,it's possible to differentiate correct and incorrect without caring.
11/28/2010,"good points, but i think your feelings are off base.changes are not implemented to simplify."
11/28/2010,"you care enough about the debate to formulate a solid opinion which falls on one side. what, exactly, is it that you don't care about?but besides that, indifference literally means you do not differentiate. if you differentiate, you can't be indifferent."
11/28/2010,"""i don't think anything i say will change decisions already made, but i hope that the next thing i read isn't that implants are gone, because the newbies did not realize how useful they were, or that we all get remaps every 6 months instead of 12 because people are not patient. ""nah you can pay for remaps now. much better. lol?"
11/28/2010,"i don't deal in opinions.in this context, the removal of the learning skills.that is one definition, and not the one which i intended."
11/28/2010,"q.e.d., yeah, you do. the entire learning skills debate is about opinions. the facts are simple; newbies leave, learning skills take time, the sooner you get them the better off you are. everything else is opinions. there is no right or wrong in the learning skills debate. that's why it's a debate. the disagreement comes down to different decisions leading to different outcomes, which you can perceive as either beneficial or not, depending on, woah hey, your opinions.you care enough to voice your opinions. i believe you don't care enough to quit the game over it, but that's not particularly remarkable.it's not one definition, it's the definition. if you take it to mean ""lack of interest"", you're interested enough to have an opinion. if you take it to mean ""showing no care or concern"", you wouldn't be voicing that opinion. which definition of ""indifference"" are you using?"
11/28/2010,"did you read the blog, ccp could have made training faster but they did not want that.learning skills have been an issue to a degree since i can remember (started 2005). i don't think anyone wants to speed up training other than what's happened already with their removal soon.if the training is too fast it would ruin the game, you don't want lots of capitals flying around with out the smaller support ships it would just be unrealistic. learning skills have been ear marked to go for sometime. it seems they were just waiting for the right time. the argument for removing learning skills has gone on for a long long time. can't say i can think of anything else that's been debated so much for it to be removed from the game.so i can't see there being a general move to dumb the game down. i think wow has been dumbed down so that younger kids are able to play it without much difficulty (world questing). but eve generally appeals to an older player base. so it's unlikey they will dumb it down too much if at all.if young players were given the option of playing eve or wow i think most would choose wow because of its cartoon appearance and bright colours.that's my opinion anyway."
11/28/2010,"here's your forum warrior uniform, good you have you back sir 07"
11/28/2010,"but i haven't attempted to answer the question of the debate, this time around, merely point out flaws in certain arguments.faulty arguments draw me like a moth to a flame.i have never stated my opinion on the removal of the learning skills."
11/28/2010,"its not lose of depth at all.tbh, the learning skills were just a pure time sink. what kind of depth does that add?and getting faction on market? great! no more cumbersome browsing through contracts and less jita spam. again no lose of depth."
11/28/2010,your comment has become my forum signature. well played.
11/28/2010,"you claimed a handful of posts ago to support the ""right side"". you take many opportunities to pick apart the arguments of one side but never the other. while you may not have explicitly voiced an opinion, you have demonstrated clear bias in favor of one side."
11/28/2010,"i certainly have a bias, but that's a far cry from a full fledged opinion.as for only picking at one side, well, one side vastly outnumbers the other, and that same side tends to rely more often on fallacious arguments. and that is what i meant by 'right side' - the side that invokes fewer fallacies. a poor way of putting it perhaps, since i don't necessarily agree with their conclusion.everyone posting in favour of the learning skills is kind of getting dogpiled anyway, so pointing out any flaws in their posts seems kind of redundant. though i can if it will make you feel better."
11/28/2010,"this is fair, and probably true at least in a literal sense; there's a lot of claims that learning skills are mandatory when in a technical sense they're not. but i would argue that the opposing side is guilty of ignoring the significant but subjective factors in favor of the literal. they're also guilty of relying on the ""slippery slope"" defense, something that i've picked apart before.i have no issue with you picking sides or having opinions or having bias in and of itself, especially given how strong my own opinions are. i simply object to you expressing bias and then claiming indifference."
11/28/2010,"you make me laugh.one of the arguments put forward by the keep them guys, was that they help get rid of new people so that there is less players less lag. so that sounds like a real good reason to keep them yeah? lmao.the only people that would possibly lose something are the ones that are training characters to sell, training skills fully trained were a good selling point."
11/28/2010,"i agree the slippery slope argument does not apply in this case, and it is brought up rather a lot. you've lost me on the 'factors in favour of the literal' bit...?and yet it is the case. i am biased in their favour, for whatever reason, but i see valid arguments on both sides, so if asked whether they should stay or go, i cannot answer either way. so while i don't agree as such with the decision to remove them, i don't object to it either. i do, however, object to some of the arguments for their removal which continue to be mentioned./bowi'm here all week.and how often was this mentioned, compared to say, the idea that one must train the learning skill's for one's first month or one's head will explode (or whatever other dire consequences await)?"
11/28/2010,"specifically, i mean that one side will argue that there is a great amount of pressure, both internal and external, for a newbie to obtain learning skills as soon as possible. the opposition will then often disregard that point on the grounds that learning skills are optional, which, while literally correct, ignores the point of the argument.fair enough."
11/28/2010,"you know, i have never seen the ""the learnings are optional and a choice"" argument made by someone who isn't a vet with a bunch of alts that he can use to play with.as a newer player, with newer player friends, with a single account, i would say they are not optional at all. point has been made in this thread that its 5 months vs 1.5 depending on if you train them right away or not. and without them, as a couple of my friends found (who subsequently quit), stuff takes forever to train after the bonus is over.""but gallians, lots of the later skills take forever to train, even months!"" yes, but that is much later in the game, t2 ships or stuff like carriers that newer people can't afford and wouldn't know what to do with. and by the point people are concerned with those, they have all manner of fun options of other ships to fly. this is not true for new players who can't fly most anything at all.if the only options in a choice are ""be ****ed up the ass now"" or ""be ****ed up the ass later"", then i would say it is no option at all.i have also seen the garbage about the ""skill race"" which misses the point that most people are not so much concerned with having the most sp in the game, but with being able to fly ships, and have fun. both of which are notoriously hard to do with no skills. which brings us back to the first point."
11/28/2010,"when the argument is that the perception that they must be trained immediately causes trouble for new players, i agree, though i have suggested (admittedly despite knowing the impossibility) that correcting people's perceptions is a better option than removing the skills.i think (or perhaps hope) however, that the reason this argument is so readily dismissed is due to it so often being presented as the learning skills actually must all be trained first. with so many people presenting the perception itself rather than the argument which the perception supports, the two become conflated in people's minds, i think."
11/28/2010,"i wish english would had been my first language, as then i could get along those kind of debates easier.. but the formulations you guys produce here are way out of my league at the moment (probably forever)"
11/28/2010,"i find that using the word ""perception"" is misleading; it implies that the pressures to obtain learning skills are largely subjective or imaginary, when in fact the direct opposite is true.maybe so, but often times the spirit is more important than the specifics. a good point should never be dismissed on a technicality."
11/28/2010,i don't think anyone will give you a hard time over your english as long as its legible. its not my first language either.
11/28/2010,"this was not simplification, that was more of a fix to a fail system, especially when you cant find faction ships on the market lol. lurning skills did not affected game play that much and there waay way too many other skills you have to train.cheers"
11/28/2010,"i don't mean to imply that the pressure to train them is merely a perception; rather, the perception is the driving force behind the pressure.it is believed that the learning skills must be trained first, at any cost, even if the cost is boredom and subsequent departure from the game. were this not the case, if this belief were not so prevalent, new players would hopefully be encouraged to do whatever suited them, dealing only with the actual benefits of each option.true, but it would help if the signal to noise ratio in the presentation of the point were better."
11/28/2010,"that not, i think (and hope) i'm writing to fluent for that.but arguing with someone on the battlefield of words and formulations in a foreign language is fighting uphill imho"
11/28/2010,"well, to be pedantic about it, the ideal is for learning skills to be trained up as much as possible but without invoking so much boredom that the player quits the game. nobody in favor of learning skill removal wants newbies to leave. well, there may be few. besides, even if you take the ""ignoring learning skills is more fun"" path, the main point is the choice between ""smaller amounts of fun sooner"" or ""greater amounts of fun later"". it is my strong and frequently vented opinion that this is not a reasonable choice to place upon newbies. but, yeah, opinions."
11/28/2010,"this is true if the desire is to maximise efficiency, but i know from personal experience that chasing efficiency, if it isn't really what you are after, is a sure way to kill the game for yourself. i think efficiency should be forgotten.if you are willing to accept long term ineffeciency and instead focus on what you actually want from the game, you can fit the learning skills in without even noticing they are there, because they reduce the time to reach your goal. if you can only ever set a short term goal (like me), you will end up being inefficient, but you will also always get to what you want quickly. on the other hand, if you have a long term goal, you will end up training lots of learning skills, but they will be reducing the time to get to your goal, not increasing it.perhaps, but i am not sure this dichotomy actually exists. at least not in all cases. if you are actually happy to aim for something well within your reach, and something else after that, and something else after that, then even if you have to wait longer for the more distant things, you should have plenty to keep you occupied in the meantime. i know i always have.and even if the dichotomy does exist, i like the idea that your character will reflect your motivations. that a character driven towards long term goals will reach them faster, while a character driven towards short term goals will reach those faster. but, yeah, opinions."
11/28/2010,"well, they are all on the left side of the keyboard so you can hit them with one hand while mousing with the other. that's why 'o' isn't orbit, for instance. all those functions are mapped in or around the wasd cluster to make it easy to do with one hand. it takes maybe five minutes to learn them, and you can always remap them, so i don't see it as a big deal.btw, 'a' is 'align', which, admittedly should be the same as 'approach' like 'd' is mapped to 'dock/jump/activate/etc'."
11/28/2010,awesome post black!
11/28/2010,"you've got interesting points on a lot, but i wanted to pick at this.it's a nice idea to say ""just relax, have fun, and go at your own pace"", but at that point you're basically fighting human nature and the basic drive for success. it'd be a little different if eve was a quiet game where you meander through the levels and everybody ends up at max level dancing in social hubs after enough time, but eve is considerably more ruthless. there's no real advancement cap, and there's a strong sense of competition. i think this is actually what drives most new players off more than anything; the idea that they'll never catch up. now that, that is a perception problem. but learning skills certainly made it look worse."
11/28/2010,"i agree that the learning skills made it look worse; certainly if you are looking to 'catch up' they will appear absolutely essential. and i also agree that human nature comes into it; this is why grinding games like wow and metagame grinding like xbox achievements and ps3 trophies are popular, people naturally like to progress quest.the thing i take issue with is this: unlike these other things, success in eve is not defined by your ability to progress quest (unless you personally decide that progress questing is your goal). so rather than fighting the drive for success, i think what is needed is to redefine success. the way you put it, ""just relax, have fun, and go at your own pace"", to me implies a fixed choice between efficiency and inefficiency, between doing it 'right' and having fun. but if success isn't defined by progress questing, then this general idea of efficiency isn't a valid metric anymore. rather you first need to define your own goal, and then define efficiency in terms of that goal. you can still strive for efficiency, to do it 'right', but aiming at your own goal.so, for a new player who just wants to shoot at things, and is instead sitting around just training learning skills, the message is not to 'just relax, have fun', but rather to work just as hard as they are, only towards something else, something that suits them. to break this idea that there is only one kind of progress, one kind of success, and see what can actually be achieved in the game.and from that point of view, the ideal way to approach learning skills depends on your aim, the most efficient route to that aim, not some general idea of efficiency.this turned out to be an interesting discussion, but unfortunately it is late (or early?) and i don't know if i'm making sense anymore and my eyes hurt so i must go to sleep now. o/"
11/28/2010,"this last year its gone from ""omg total waste of time to train them gonna take you 3 1/2 year of training for them to be worth it"" to ""omg when i start i new char i should never logg and only train learning skills cus i will never be able to compete"".**** the new players, you know the picture of eve learning curve. i like that picture.**** the new players really hard up the ass. **** them so hard, they quit the game.eve's been going downhill ever since oveur ****ed all over the playerbase by complaining about how much money ccp lost pr month banning all those macro's."
11/28/2010,"while what you say is generally true, it's not the impression one gets from eve from a two week trial. pure marketing says that learning skills are a stupid idea that drive off potential customers. learning skills are bad business, and there are plenty of other things that we players can and will do that will drive off the rest of the riff-raff that tries out the game."
11/28/2010,"this.also, happened to wow, and things slowly turned from worse to sh*t and from there to... even worse."
11/28/2010,"i began to play eve five years ago, and continue to play it, because of the freedom of choice we have as players, things like the ownership we have over our stuff and even the space we live in and how the game is so player driven.when they start taking away our ""freedom"" then i will begin to worry. making the game more accessible, taking away needless complication, and simplifying things is not something that sparks any kind of negative reaction in my brain. looks like they are improving the game without changing what it is fundamentally. a sandbox."
11/28/2010,"many people believe that eve is being made simpler by removal of learning skills. simple is the wrong term. eve is being made easier and this is not ""an avalanche waiting to happen"". rather it is a continuation of a program aimed at making eve easier. or, if you will, the avalanche started some time ago.it's been going on for some time and will continue into the foreseeable future. ccp believes they will acquire more subscribers by making the game easier and that this acquisition will more than offset any loss they suffer from older players quitting. another goal achieved by making eve easier is narrowing the difference in ability between players that have been in eve for years and those who have only been here for months. here, again, ccp believes this is how they will grow their subscriber base.the software industry looks at this phenomena in terms of acquisition and retention. most of industry realizes retention over acquisition is far more cost effective and worthwhile to the bottom line. ccp believes that acquisition over retention is the way to go. as such many of ccps decisions are viewed as junior decisions.that having been said, mothermoons comments in post 33 of this thread make some interesting points and the removal of learning skills with those comments in mind may not necessarily fit snuggly into the category of making eve easier. in other words, making eve easier in one place made learning skills less desirable for the game. you poke there and something pops up somewhere else.best regards,windjammer"
11/28/2010,"but ccp introduced an artificial boundary with the double training speed. i agree with you, but i still think you and other over look what really happened. learning skills were not complained about as much if at all until this change.6 weeks, or 20 weeks, your choice.i mean skills shouldn't be all there is to success and progress in eve. progress should be measured by what you accomplish, and how you go about it. however i would argue the super fast or slow learning skills choice actually takes the focus off of the game and puts it on skill points. learning skills in them self make it seem like skill points must be super important if there is a skill dedicated to making them accumulate faster, and as we know, to most players being able to get something faster means you've progressed in a game. thus i say removing learning skills put the focus back on what eve is really about, and doesn't distract new players into thinking that sp is what they need more of. if you don't train them now it has a ripple effect on later skill training as well, not only do you have to wait 5 months now because you didn't train during bonus time, but that other player is miles ahead of you. it currently takes 3 months to get to 1.6 million sp, but it only takes 1.5 months to get to 1.6m if you just train learning skills. now, that puts you 1.5 months of effective sp behind the player that did not train learning skills. however in 1.5 more months, you have now met player b in effective sp, and will now begin to pass him at double the rate in real skills. so player a says, oh man i guess i should train learning skills now that i'm 3 months into this game, so he does, he spends 4 months training them to a decent level.now player a has 1.5 months of effective sp and 4 months of learning skill sp. player b has the same 1.5 months of effective sp and 4 months more of real effective sp(his learning skills done on top of all this. player a has been in a drake for the past 4months without support skills.player b is a tech 2 battleship with all of his support skills trained.now if any player with a brain or that likes mmos sees this to be the case (because they use evemon or go to eve university or have nice corpmates.) they will think ""ah ha! so to advance in eve i must train learning skills, sp is the important thing!""and bam! they have completely missed the point of the game because they don't want to be 4 months behind in ship and weapons skills, and they want a big sp number. before eve was different, you knew it would take 4-5 months no matter when you started, so waiting 3 months meant that the guy training learning had way less real skills than you, but it would take him about 5-6 months before he started to get more real skills than you. now your behind in your 3rd month of gameplay, and what happens when your like, oh i actually want to play eve for a long time!you realize that you could advance faster effective sp wise at the 3 month mark by restarting! that's madness and only works to push the idea that sp is important on new players like a mallet. (opps caps locks)i like the idea of future eve players not knowing they have it easy and just thinking ""oh in this game there is no way to advance faster than any other player. and they will have to find something else that makes them feel like they are progressing more than other players. like getting killmails, or making friends, going on mining ops, starting little projects like little forums sigs, or can art, eve grave site, killing miners in high sec, starting a sig company, making eve videos, bloging, running into wormholes, finding the epic missions."

11/28/2010,"so in short, this change while not necessary before the bonus training time, takes the general idea of what means progress in a game, and makes it so you have to focus on something other than skill gain. instead what skills you train, and what you do with them will become important. just remember, future players in 1-2 years won't know they have a boost, and will have never heard of learning skills. just like how new players have no idea what a vaga nano fit is :pi think it's a good change in the end, this in fact seperates eve even farthur from other mmos, where there is an optimal path to leveling up that noobs don't knw about and dispite just playing the game like it should be played, end up months behind other players that started at the same time.now the game will be more about being effective with your choices and what you are given. there is no longer a low hanging carrot to temp players into not having fun."
11/28/2010,"basically with double training bonus this item gives a new players +6 in all attributes. this is nuts, because this would, with a set of plus 5's make it so a players could get according to evemon, all of their learning skills done to 5/3 in 3 weeks. holy ****. now that aside, i think it was a wierd time to introduce the item considering the changes to learning skills, kinda like giving you some cake, but then taking it away, that's kinda odd. as far as paying for an advantage, i have to say i'm on the fence. on one hand, this gives players a reason to buy the box, because other than that why not just buy it online? it's a small (after learning skill bonus removal) advantage, and i'm for helping poor noobs think they can catch up to me, thus maybe they will get out into space and realize skill points aren't as important as tactics and having backup. that extra 20% weapon damage isn't as important as web vs. scram, or afterburner vs. mwd.on the other hand, it kinda penalizes players who buy online, and makes them wonder, oh maybe i should just restart and buy a boxed copy for the +6 implant and get farther? there seems to be zero benefit for buying the game online, and it brings up the issue of progression is based on how fast you train skills, not what you do with them. maybe the fix to this is to offer more than one way to buy the game (steam,retail,eve site) and offer different benefits for each option. i'm all for making it easier for new players, but making it easier just for the players that know what they are doing, and know the little tricks is not cool.i have to assume that mostly every new players does not spend a week or so looking up every trick about how to start a new character and min/max the hell out of playing the game. an older more experienced players will have an advantage, even if there isn't some boxed copy, or master learning plan. now the following is based on the idea that they do not get rid of the the new noob implant.maybe buying right off the eve online site should give you an implant and starter set of planetary interaction equipment. right off the bat you can build yourself a little home and start making some extra moneys (which will be a good deal to a new player)while another version, like on steam, can be based more on their resent hats wonderland. with a set of 4 or 5 one of kind ships, like the special shuttle and wormhole exploration ship. this would appeal to players that don't care about starting off faster, and just want shiny junk to play with :pas it stands, an uninformed player would not know they could spend the same amount of money at amazon as the eve online site (less even) and get a nice huge bonus to their game. and that bugs me. that after they join they are like, oh what the hell, i could of spent the same amount on a different site and got a bonus?!?!?!the idea itself does not bother me as long as it it kept to vanity items, and 1 month noob boosts. i'm all for noobs having an easy time at 1st. but what i'm not for is only the experienced noobs (wait what?) getting the advantage. as in stands only a current player would understand the value of the boxed bonus item, and i think that's an important fact to remember. *wipes forehead*"
11/28/2010,which begs the question whether ccp used the right reason(s) for the sledgehammer approach.
11/28/2010,"itt: crumpy returns to his ""forum warrior"" status by simply choosing a topic where he can get the most opposition, and dives head-on into the battle.haven't you people notice that crumplecorn is simply arguing with you people for the sake of arguing?also, i see you haven't lose your touch, crumpy. wb o7"
11/28/2010,"noticed something was up about a day and a half ago when none of his posts contained any serious opinions etheir way. they were just designed to pick one term and attack it to keep the topic off reasons why it was a good idea.watching trippa's counters was pretty good too, she does not give up. i am glad most of our opinions are the same. that would be a long, long fight full of pick apart quotes."
11/28/2010,we know the learning skills put people off of the game.the fact that most people learn them as soon as possible really makes them unnecessary. so why turn people off of the game because of something that's not necessary in the first place.a lot of people will aim to get learning skills to 5/4 as soon as they can. so there is no major difference for them being there or removing them and replacing the lost attributes.only real difference is people don't need to spend 2 - 3 months training something that only really amounts to wasted time and less fun because they are not able to train what they need to have fun with because they are training learning skills.these two reasons are good enough to get rid of learning skills by themselves.only people like i've said before that really lose out are those that were training characters to sell. training skills fully trained were probably the biggest selling point as it was a set of skills that you needed regardless of what professions you chose to follow. you might say that you don't need all of them for some professions but if you are selling a character you would want the character to appeal to the biggest section of the market. biggest section of the market would be everyone who was looking to buy a character in this case as it would mean you could get on playing the game without having any boring learning skills to learn.
11/28/2010,"i agree.oh they were always complained about. but if the boost is the real problem now, the boost should be fixed.if i really wanted to be a forum warrior again, i would have chosen to actively disagree with the anti-learning crowd rather than posting the occasional nitpick. though, yes, it would have been because there are more of them the argument that we should remove things that everyone ends up doing is a dangerous one.used right, the learning skills save you time."
11/28/2010,not in this case and you know it.now you really are trolling.you should have called your character 'grumblecorn' it would have been more appropriate.
11/28/2010,"i wasn't referring to this case, and you know it."
11/28/2010,"so you were not actually answering the post . you reference the post and did not explain yourself fully, trying to elicit a reaction. so you were trolling."
11/28/2010,do i really have to explain why removing anything that everyone ends up training would be a bad road to go down?
11/28/2010,"you are just arguing for the sake of arguing. learning skills were the debate not anything else. if we follow your reasoning there would be no skill tree left. that's not going to happen, most of the eve players would probably leave if that was the case. i've not seen anyone complaining about skills other than the learning skills (trolls aside), have you?"
11/28/2010,actually it was your argument. that it would result in the removal of all skills simply shows it isn't a very good one.
11/28/2010,"i can see you are unable to reason on any sensible level so as far as you are concerned, i'll leave it there."

11/28/2010,heh heh
11/28/2010,"what about people mentioning it will take x number of years to max out all the skills? as if playing the game was to achieve this feat over all other options, bar none."
11/28/2010,"nah, i don't hate anyone, life is too short to hold grudges."
11/28/2010,"arbitrary limits and mandatory skills are bad, m'kay?"
11/28/2010,"why would people want to max out all the skills half of them would be useless to them anyway, surely that's not why most people play the game. i know some people want to be the ones with the highest amount of sp but personally i could not careless about that."
11/28/2010,"to the op:complexity you seek? how about meaningful complexity, rather than millions of inane, idiotic, little tweaky things posing as complexity? did you know that consciousness in 3 dimensions is only possible by connection to the quantum field via pi electron resonance clouds contained in the tubulin protein molecules of neuronal microtubules? <-- that is complex. this game, not so much...patience? i am currently enrolled in an atmospheric physics class. doing some reasonable arithmetic, i calculate that it takes longer to train eve's fake skills in planetology from 4 to 5 than it does to complete a real upper division science course in atmospheric physics. sorry, but patience does not enter into it. it seems completely bogus to make eve's fake skills that are really just a timer that unlocks game content, to take longer than actually learning real hard science. bogus.remaps? skills trees are stupidly designed to encompass radical variation in the attributes needed to efficiently learn any given tree. [try training for exploration and you'll see what i mean.] and we can only map attributes once in 365 days. this pushes players to use stupid looking training scenarios that accommodate the stupidly designed skills trees. players should not be so constrained, as such stupid game mechanics are not in any way tied to fun. and if you want to call that ""fun complexity"", i will counter by calling it a stupid, inane, and annoying exercise in tedium. there are two fixes for this, as i see it: 1) align all skills in a given tree with the same attributes, or 2) leave the stupidly designed skills trees as they are, but allow remaps much more often to accommodate them.an avalanche? there should be an avalanche in the wings. eve's ui is so outdated, and is complete garbage by any standards, let alone comparison to any other modern mmos. in terms of meeting the competition, and keeping up with modern technical standards, eve is in need of a lot of rework. avalanche? please, bring it on !"
11/28/2010,"nobody wants to have the most skills. most people just want to be able to fly x at moderate competency, or even high competency. i find the ""skills don't matter"" crowd tend to be people with numerous alts and who can do everything in the game, so for them skills trully don't matter.for real people though, skills matter a lot. and not in the ""gotta catch them all"" sense, but in the ""can't do anything"" one."
11/28/2010,"pretty much. and being able to sell faction ships on the market is a bad idea..why exactly?i think there is no need to explain why the removal of learning skills is anything but a step towards making eve more ""simple"", as that has been discussed enough here. i'm just surprised people even manage to think of it that way. i couldn't possibly find 1 single reason to even have those skills in the first place. from a game design point of view, learning to learn is just bad anyway.people get upset about anything though, so whatever..."
11/28/2010,"oh come on man, you've been around as long as i have, the thread would pop up randomly, but never in the numbers it had been over the past year or so.could be other reasons for that though.edit:hey no one commented on my point that learning skills also make players think that sp must be important if there is a skill dedicated to just getting it faster. and that the removal my have the added benefit of making new players in a few years think that sp must not be the focus of the game since there are so few way to increase it, and will focus on other parts of the game to get their gamer, progression fix. (who will completely forget about today's forum spam, in the way way of vaga nanos)"
11/28/2010,"i don't think its a good point. sp is very important as you need it to do things. the pro learnings crowd seems to think that the anti learnings crowd wants sp for the sake of sp, but the fact is that without sp, or skills, you can't do anything.getting rid of the boost would be a terrible solution unless the purpose was to make eve a deserted wasteland."
11/28/2010,"my thoughts:has anyone ever started a second account and spent weeks and weeks of trainig just for mandatory skills like learning? has anyone brought a friend to the game, or just told a newbie in your corp to train learning for the next x weeks to do things ""properly"" ?both are common events in this game and both are complete joykills, which explains the general elation at this announcement.so yes, its a good change, but at the same time it does simplify the game in a negative way. if you consider skillpoints like fixed income in real life, you will see there is natural variety introduced by people's own individuality. some people wanna squirrel away their money for retirement. they can't afford everything they want now, but in the long term they will have way more to spend from investments. others will take what they get and blow it on fun stuff right away.its a bit silly to expect newbs to read up all the materials on optimizing skill training and plan for the future where it takes them over a year (or more) to recoup their skillpoint investments. but people do it, the resources are already there, and they get an advantage over those who don't.is the tradeoff ccp made here worth it? i'd say yes, but there is always another way to do things:in my opinion, the rate of skill training is way too fast and right now its only getting faster. and the longer skillpoints accumulate, the more homogenous and rounded characters become. most of the playerbase is now a bunch of jack-of-all-trades types. one of the ways this affects the game is organizational teamwork. in newer corporations, the things people can do are limited and they're forced to have specific people fill specific roles. in older organizations, just having the right number of people online matters - not who they are, because its expected that each person is gonna be rounded enough to fill any role needed at the time. the longer the game goes on, and the bigger the organization, the less uniqueness and relevance your character is going to have. which is more fun for you? joining a corporation because they wanted +1 in the membercount, or joining a corporation because you can supply them with something they need or lack?i would have removed learning skills without giving everyone +12 attributes, slowing down the overall training rate. at the same time, players would be allowed to boost skill training by up to 50% by leeching skillpoints from skills they already trained.this lets people respecialize their characters very very slowly over time. it makes sense in both ingame fiction and from the game design point of view that newbies should not be punished in the long run for mistakes made in the early game (which the attribute respec and current learning removal changes address). tell me if this is familiar: ""i'm combat specced but i have some mining"". a new set of learning skills could be introduced to speed up the rate of respec (10% per level up to 50%). so if you plan to do a major shift from say.. minmatar to caldari, you could sink some skillpoints into this area and do it faster than the guy who is just making minor changes by depleting a single skill to zero. when you're done, you recover the skillpoints you invested in learning by depleting them back to zero. in effect, you're penalized temporarily in total skillpoints available during the time period that you are trying to change your character.after these changes, the total skillpoint count is probably the only thing that will make characters unique - but its a metric that won't matter as much. anyone can aim for total efficiency. it also results in there being a lot more ""full specialists"" (ie. everything to 5) because players will be less tempted to average and balance out their skillpoints equally. this encourages specific team roles, and makes unique corporations/divisions based on specific skill sets viable.~138m sp and countin'"
11/28/2010,"exactly. sp as such don't do anything to enable you to fly anything but to be able to fly a number of ships and fullfil a number of roles you need sp - and a lot of them. no sp means not being able to do anything at all.it already takes 1.5 - 2 years to be able to fly and fit a variety of ships and be able to say do logistics, cov ops, l4 missioning and fly a t3 cruiser, all with decent t2 fits. 2 years is a long enough wait, i don't see why we should extend that by 2 months from training learning skills.the ""catching up"" thing is an illusion, most people don't want to be able to do more than other, older players - they want to be able to do things at all, preferably with good support skills."
11/28/2010,"true to a degree, but i now train things just 'because'. remember once you hit level 5, you ain't going any higher."
11/28/2010,"this is what i'm talking about. people with 138 million sp not only think sp doesnt matter but that people should train slower which is, mind boggling to say the least.the rate of training is way too slow my good sir, some skills take months to train. there is already specialization but that only applies to newer chars because they have low amounts of sp.if what you want is specialization like that i would say make training faster and instill a sp ceiling. say, 50 million. now that would be true specialization wouldn't it?people above that ceiling should have their sp removed to bring them down to that ceiling. there you go, specialization at a rate that newer people can actually train without losing their minds.win win win win.that is, unless the real purpose is to nerf new people and ensure they not only never catch up, but can never fly anything."
11/28/2010,"you're quite the pleb if you think i'd even bother to write a post just to 'nerf newbies'. its the most laughably generic response you could have come up with. its like whenever i write something to increase the level of pvp consequences or player interaction, i get called a griefer. no, i wrote it because i have a far better perspective on character advancement than most, and can offer an alternative suggestion to what ccp is doing. i've seen it from multiple angles many times, including starting new characters, starting specialized characters, and helping newbies with their own training plans. right now there are only two motivations for a faster skill training rate, and they're both garbage:business reality: ccp has a ton of ships, content and playstyles, they want players to experience many in order to keep them interested and keep them subscribed. the problem: its more fun in the short term, but in the long term people run out of newness. you basically burn through all that content at a faster rate, because they'd rather have you stick around for 1-2 years guaranteed than hope you're still interested in new space pixels five years later.- selfishness: players want to advance faster. the problem: everyone plays by the same rules and the relative difference always stays the same. it even increases in the case of attribute respecs, because only vets can keep training two attribute types for a full year without gimping themselves. the same goes for implants.. making them cheaper to the point where everyone can afford them just makes them a requirement, and screws over the casuals and newbies who can't invest that much without grinding for a longer time.the idea i mentioned addresses both in significant ways. if i had anything to add to it, it would be that i'd want to see the skillpoint shifting apply from any character on the same account *except ones you purchased*. this lets people with a lot of sp divide it up into 2 or 3 different personas and engage in different styles of play. wanna do minmatar rp but you're amarr and can't even fly minmatar? your options now are to essentially ruin your main character for a subpar experience, or get a second account and start from scratch, or get a second account and spend a lot of isk to buy an able character.for the first time in history, there would be a legitimate gameplay reason for people having three characters on one account, as opposed to just metagaming with scout, market, and forum alts."
11/28/2010,"sorry but i fail to see how forcing a 2 month waiting period is 'increasing complexity' or anything. i think, and i'm not the only one obviously, that it's just ****ing annoying and something nobody enjoys.also faction ships on the market reduces complexity? more mind/market games, i say!"

11/28/2010,"thanks to this update i not only have a reason to look forward to eve in december, with some odd 1.8 million skill point to play with, but also have finally managed to convinced several rl friends to join. the removal of learning skills and the accompanying bonus with an additional 2 attribute points in each attribute has removed a lot of the initial ""down time"" from new characters and made it so that new players can hop right into learning fun, gratifying abilities immediately without holding their character back. the difference between a 5/4 learning character and a 0/0 learning character was roughly 8 million sp per year. it would be foolish to make a new character and not learn all the learning skills first.tl;dr version: thank you for this ccp. this upcoming change will be the best one i've seen since starting this game for breathing even more life into a thriving game. :)"

11/28/2010,"local is one part of a wider issue involving intel resources in general. ccp would not be willing to make a significant change to local(for example, introducing a local delay) without making sure it's balanced in their opinion with all intel resources in general. iirc the issue came up in the past(requesting a local delay, or some sort of way to prevent things like automated local alerts), and ccp replied that they wanted to do an overhaul of intel tools in general instead of just making a change to local in 0.0.still it's kind of a nagging issue to see so many invincible macroers in 0.0 so it's worth bringing up to ccp again."
11/28/2010,"i doubt ccp will ever 'fix' local in 0.0 in such a manner than the players perceived as victims (ratters, plexers, miners and macro users) will ever have less of an advantage than they currently do.this game went pro carebear the moment ccp realized that it made them more $ and the current paradigm isn't going to change."
11/28/2010,"the problem is that whatever intel tools they end up giving players, the bots and hacks will always give people an edge. personally i cant think of any intel tools design that will reward skilled and alert players while not allowing bots to essentially be invincible and not giving a skilled attacker essentially free reign to kill everybody.the way wormholes work with local is awesome(although i think the mashing the scanner is annoying), i wish they made 0.0 like that, but ccp is afraid to rock the boat."
11/28/2010,"the argument has been hashed to death, i just specifically couldn't find any developer posts."
11/29/2010,"because bumping matters, that's why. this would pretty much eliminate bumping, as written, and that is a bad thing. and it would also allow people to pre-align and then not move, e.g., miners in a belt could ""charge-up"" their warp drives, and continue to mine / stay in range of their rocks, then bolt as soon as someone shows up. basically it removes any downside to pre-aligning. also, op doesn't very clearly state that if you pre-align to something, then click to warp to something in the same linear path that your ""charge-up"" will still work.visual effects are nice, make the game shiny. but leave the warp mechanic alone."
11/29/2010,"you only charge up when you click ""warp""not when you align."
11/29/2010,"i support cooler warping effects, but leave the mechanics alone."
11/29/2010,"i would much prefer this kind of warping mechanic. you would have a real ""shock"" effect of ships landing. you may want to add ""trails"" to ships warping off so that their destination can still be tracked.the biggest problem with punching straight up to maximum warp speed is the old session change timer. you will be stuck at many gates, unable to jump, simply because your session change timer is still active when you arrive at the gate. will be even more frustrating than it is now but their may be a work around.all in all i agree with the proposal as an idea for change"
11/29/2010,"i would prefer this to how it is now. especially if it goes from 100~ m/s to 3 au/s almost instantly, rather than the long build up."
11/29/2010,"you wouldn't instantly arrive at the other gate. you would still travel at warp speed to and from each celestial, you just enter and exit warp instantly(?)."
11/29/2010,"i support the graphics change.i am in favor of reducing or eliminating the exponential ramp-up and ramp-down at warp speed. alternately, i support scaling the duration of the ramp-up and ramp-down periods with the warp speed (that is, ships that warp at 13.5 au/s have two-ninths the exponential ramp times of ships with 3.0 au/s warp speed).i am undecided on the proposed aligning mechanics."

11/29/2010,i like it. i wonder if it's not being done because of a technical hurdle or something. to somewhat mitigate the dogpile effect of reinforcements being able to affect the battle more because of the slowdown i would think some sort of staggered entry to the system might have to be implemented when the slowdown gets to a certain point.
11/29/2010,"i like the idea, but i see it also needing to impact the guy in the station fitting his ships, and the other guy in station buying stuff and selling stuff from the market...the issues i see, which can be resolved quick, by the people in the fleets are:close your market windows before jumping into a system.close your assets window before jumping into a system.set your overview properly so things like wrecks and drones are appropriately visible/invisible.get all your fleet members to use cables rather than wireless (reducing latency).the bullet time is a good idea but i find it hard to think of how it could be reasonably implemented so it couldn't be abused, unless it applied to the whole universe."
11/29/2010,"the way i see it is as huge fleetfights are rare, and this is a really good way of helping to keep gameplay up whilst ccp run around like crazyfools! just suspend typical non combat or combat related stuff in the system eg. market orders, contract acceptance etc... as the fleetfight would be a temporary thing. if you're in a null sec system where a massive fleetfight is to occur, and you're not planning to fight or provide recon, you tend to have time befor things really kick off and you tend to know that somethings bout to go down!if anything u could allow a timer to say something about networked comm systems going down due to projected high congestion, and count down untill not combat related game elements are isolated."

11/29/2010,"a fairly simple proposal, not much needing to be said. obviously being able to target yourself is out of the question, so perhaps all that is needed is an additional right-click option to repair self. i don't foresee any major unbalancing issues here. although tactics may change. true though you could go on and on about how this would change so many things. i just happen to think that being able to repair yourself with your own repair drones is logical, simply put."
11/29/2010,"simple proposal sure, but there is a reason it isn't already possible. it isn't nearly so simple to make happen and the value of this ability didn't seem to be all that high to rework the drone code."

11/29/2010,"a lot can probably be done by a change to the ammo (as blasters are also in need of help).suggestion (may/may not work- judge for yourself):damage across all ammo variants be the same, but shorter range ammo uses less capacitor. this makes hybrids more than just a different flavour of laser. other balancing would also be necessary though."
11/29/2010,"that would be like concord not allowing your guns to fire unless you have aggression rights on a target in highsec, but then ccp implementing collision damage. a bit more plausible lore wise, but gameplay wise it's the same."
11/29/2010,oh god yes. does this mean we can finally gank all the scammers in jita with a crowbar mk ii?
11/29/2010,i'm sure this will happen one day...maybe 2 years from now.
11/29/2010,"not supported.i don't want to have to watch my back all the time. i'd rather be able to peacefully play some station poker and lol at the guy in the girl av spaming ""cyber for 1 mil isk"" vrs listen to a bunch of ""you got pwned noob!"""
11/29/2010,"i can agree with that, mostly. but i do think there needs to be a way for capsuleers to fight. not only is eve supposed to be at least somewhat harsh, but it is also supposed to be relatively realistic. ccp tried to come up with explanations for all of the weird things in eve, from canon to lag (aka ""spacial anomalies""). i can't imagine an explanation that would make sense for capsuleers to be unable to shoot each other.perhaps, instead of making combat unavailable, it should be heavily discouraged.let's say, as an example, every time you shoot someone unprovoked in highsec space you get a 5% penalty with sec status (just as an example, i don't know what the actual number is), then in highsec stations or station areas, if you pull a gun, you get a 10% sec hit along with a big sec hit with the station's owners, and you heavily fined. if you manage to kill someone before getting concordokken, then the consequences are twice as bad, or something like that. for the rpers, it can be said that the extra consequences are due to increased chances of hitting people who aren't capsuleers, can't respawn, and aren't part of any sort of military effort."
11/29/2010,"nothing personal, but i'm going to use you as a bit of a sounding board. the internet spaceships fill that role, i think, don't they? in that case, we should have permadeath when we die away from our pods (which have those brain scanners, you see), or, instead of station security pointlessly killing the immortal capsuleer for murder, they would do the realistic punishment of incarcerating them.how about something analogous to this..... i agree with that.as a punishment for pulling a gun, i guess, i think implementing a punishment for something as simple as brandishing one's weapon might be taking it a bit far, personally. which doesn't make any sense because capsuleers are as mortal as anyone else outside of their pods, without the pod-based neural scanner that forms the entire basis for our immortality."
11/29/2010,"i recommend reading the empyrean age. i'm not sure how to do spoiler tags, but i don't think it's a dramatic spoiler anyway. one of the capsuleers in the novel makes use of clones specifically for suicide missions. he is out of pod when he 'dies', and while not being connected to a pod he is somehow reborn.i don't believe it ever explains how this is possible, but it's been a while since i read it. that, and i hear the jove have shiny new technology."
11/29/2010,"i hate to be a complete troll, but why is anyone worried about this? its just testing phase for wod which may or may not have any relevance to eve as a whole. same with dust, unless they place in mechanics that affect sov or somehow destroy large amounts of isk, no cc's don't count cause they are cheap and don't make a lot of money anyway. if they don't and more importantly don't know how to make these things integrate with eve in a tangible way we can go back to what we were doing and let the dev's sit and think about why no one is using stuff they spent years tinkering with."
11/29/2010,i dont object to you having a peaceful place to play poker; i do object to playing poker being the only thing there is to do.
11/29/2010,"if everything fails they could just set up some consoles in the stations where your chars have the option to play ""quafe-man""(tm) and steer him on his epic quest to squash ebil piwates with thrown cold turkey. oh hey, did i just discover a new epic isk-sink? but yeah, seriously, the implementation of any kind of in-station combat options will most likely determine where the whole wis stuff heads to... yet another attempt at mimicking ""2nd life"" or proving that eve-o is still somewhat of a pvp game."
11/29/2010,"that's true too, don't want it to be boring. i suppose i just don't want to get shot in the back of the head by anyone just wandering around looking for lols, even if there is no damage involved. it's just an anoyance.perhaps stations, even high sec stations, need a dangerous areas, back alleys, and there can be pummeling and muggings and things of that nature. not sure if i'll bother to train closed fist to lvl 5 though."
11/29/2010,"since it is currently possible to do exactly what you're doing, but we currently do not see alliances profligate in their deployment of rr sentry domi fleets, one would have to assume that there is some reason we do not see fleets of rr sentry domis.the only issue i can see would be retrieving sentry drones, so perhaps adding the ability for sentry drones to mwd back to the 'mothership' would cause this rr sentry domi proliferation to become the case.at least that would be a change from the current fascination with drake fleets :)as a drone user myself, i could not agree more with this proposal, warts and all!edit: ""warts"" specifically being the ""fleet"" versions of commands, which i feel would create a significant advantage for fleets using sentry drones."
11/29/2010,supported on all counts.
11/29/2010,ja
11/29/2010,since andrea griffin showed me this topic i will copy paste my ideas that i had in other thread...
11/29/2010,"i agree that eafs need some hot dev lovin', mainly in the area of survivability. the big question is in what area to improve it.* sig reduction* speed tanking* resistance buffingor, as an oddball idea - cov ops cloak? i guess it would depend on whether you want eafs as a minature combat recon or force recon."

11/29/2010,"why assume they have to sell 1 day plexes? as several people have suggested selling 60 day gtc's that convert to 60 mini-plexes will give the same value for plex, not cost more in transaction fees, and let them charge less then $15 for small cosmetic crap (hint i'm not paying $15 for cosmetic ****)"
11/29/2010,"not supported. the cost of a t2 bpo means that it takes a very long time to get your investment back. in the meantime your isk is locked into that bpo even if the thing that you make from it is not profitable. hence owning one is a long term investment/risk. because there is invention, there is no issue with people making t2 products for a cheap startup cost even if they do not own a bpo."
11/29/2010,lame. better if you have to hunt for them.
11/29/2010,"remove or make available.thoes saying ""stop whining and earn the isk to buy""...the original owners got given them for free, they didnt buy them.they are not vanity items, they generate real isk.their existance and use in game prevents economical invention of t2 mods for sale on markets with t2 bpo fed mods."
11/29/2010,"you are so wrong.the only items that t2 bpos prevent invention from being profitable are those items that no one ever uses like armor thermic plating ii and stuff. i've made over 80b profit in the last 16 months from invention, so if you are unable to do your market research, don't blame your failures on t2 bpos.that's true and it's why invention was added. it was a bad decision to introduce them in the first place, but doing any change to them right now will screw hundreds of people that saved to afford one. the least worst course of action is to not change anything.i'm sure that if ccp could go back in time, they would never add them and implement invention from the start instead, but unfortunatly, that's not possible.anyways, i'm done posting in this thread unless someone comes up with an argument that isn't ""i want free isk now, it's unfair!"""
11/29/2010,i agree with these statements.
11/29/2010,"actually, wouldn't it be the least worst course of action to make t2 bpo's available in game from in game mechanics and spawns like every other bpo and item? the current system only creates a money printing machine for bpo holders. yes, you can make more money via invention. but it also takes 10 times the work and has 10 times the risk. a bpo guarantees a steady income pretty much forever, at no risk, and no effort.if they are so meaningless, then everyone should get a hand at them, and their numbers should increase, no?supported."
11/29/2010,"i suppose you have stopped buying ammunitions and ships when the npc sell order were removed several years ago, right? it is very evident that some people have returned after a hiatus, first the ecm whines, now this, what will be the next?"

11/29/2010,i'm guessing a new wave of suicide gank whines.brace for incoming threads breathlessly detailing how every new player will certainly be murdered as soon as he undocks if ccp dont make hi-sec safe for freighters.
11/29/2010,"some good points by mishkaii, so i'll answer.that's called invention. seeding t2 bpos just like t1 bpos wouldn't change the fact that the original owners got them for free, it will only make t2 a second t1. it won't remove the unfair part of t2 bpos.same for invention, it is silly money. to get the same daily income from t2 bpos, i would have to buy 330b worth of t2 bpos at a 3 years roi. my invention startup cost was 3b. both bpos and invention are crazy moneymakers and both are ""fair"", the only thing that isn't is that the original owners got them from an unfair mechanic in regards to newer players, like you, me and most people in this thread.yeah, it's a lot of clicking because the ui is utter ****. with a better ui, it wouldn't be more than 10 minutes of clicking a day.you're wrong that invention is risky, though. the build time of a batch of modules/ships is less than 2 days (10 hours in my case). the market can move ~5% in 2 days, but it doesn't matter because the profit margin is 40% to 75%. on the other hand, spending 10b+ on a t2 bpo is very risky because game design changes can waste your investment. the guy that bought the 10mn mwd ii bpo a few weeks before tyrannis should know what i mean. invention guarantees a steady income pretty much forever, at no risk and medium effort.a t2 bpo guarantees a steady income until game design changes waste it, at a medium risk and low effort.for the same reasons as i said earlier, it wouldn't remove the only unfair thing about t2 bpos, which is the way they were won in the first place. it would make t2 another t1. everyone can already ""get a hand at them"". do what i, and hundreds people, have done before: htfu and head here."
11/29/2010,"i would rather see invention made into less of a lottery than messing about with t2 bpos. if you want one of those buy one, but giving the researching time to make it super profitable would be about 2 years, power to you.i'd rather see an improvement on t2 bpcs and preharps some limited research allowed on them to increase the mat and time needs beyond the use of decryptors."
11/29/2010,"that wouldn't change the profit/day of inventors, it would only lower the sale price of t2 items. the profit/day of inventors depends on the demand for t2 items and the number of inventors. unless your idea brings a lot of new inventors into t2 manufacturing, item abc ii would cost:200k: (datacores*invention chance) + material cost300k: inventors profitinstead of the current400k: (datacores*invention chance) + material cost300k: inventors profittl;dr inventors make money because of the relatively low number of people interested in t2 production and your change wouldn't change their income."
11/29/2010,"the original owners essentially did buy them with points in lotteries held for each bpo, not all ( and i'd suspect the vast majority ) were t20 bpos, i'm not even sure if those remained in game after the fallout over it. either way most of the bpos were obtained legitimately through the game mechanics of the time.secondly you're assuming that the original owners still have these items, i'd suspect that between people gaining and losing interest in eve over the years, people moving away from places where it's easy to cash out on t2 bpos and other changes very few of them lie in the hands of their original owners and those who have them now had to pay isk for it.no matter how you view it it ends up being robbery of older/richer players who managed to get their hands on these things and even as someone who dosen't have anything like this i don't see any better solution proposed here."
11/29/2010,"the only way you're ever going to remove t2 bpo's from the game is if you save up enough money to buy every single one of them, jet them in a can and blow it up."
11/29/2010,hmm wonder how much that would cost...
11/29/2010,"as has been said before, the existence of t2 bpos has a neglible effect on the eve economy, and most of the people who own them saved up and paid good isk for them. i wont support any proposal that gives these players a big fat middle finger.and introducing more t2 bpos into the game would dilute invention, which is a great mechanic - one of the best things introduced since i started playing, in my opinion - and eventually the distinctive flavour of tech 2 would be gone; as the other poster said earlier, t2 would just be a more expensive t1.building on the above suggestions, here's a counter-proposal for getting rid of the t2 bpos (best of all: it's player driven!)counter proposal:have a trusted member of the eve community release the full api key of one of their characters.ask people to donate money to that character for the purpose of eliminating t2 bposthat character buys up t2 bpos with the donated moneytake these out in a shuttle and self-destruct, generating a killmail so that everyone can see that the bpo is gone forever (this might need multiple attempts per bpo)all we need for this to work is for ccp to distinguish between bpos and bpcs on killmails - or for there to be some other way of confirming the destruction of an item via api... is there a better way in existence already? i confess, i don't know.oh, and for someone with the requisite gravitas to step up."
11/29/2010,"let nelass, i would to correct two little details..- self-destructing does not generate a killmail nor does it generate any loot.- recording the destruction of said bpos would probably be the best way to make sure that it actually happens.edit: fixed typos"
11/29/2010,"i disagree with your points (the falloff bonus is good with rails that have lots of it), and the new void will make the optimal bonus a lot better with blasters, which is admittedly pretty meh now.however your suggestion would make it a better ship."
11/29/2010,"simple, i (and many others) could do with a few more jump clones.i propose to change the infomorph psychology from +1 jump clone/level to +2/level.*or* add a new skill with informorph psychology 5 as prereq and rank 3 multiplier with +1 jc/level."
11/29/2010,"supporting this, duh."
11/29/2010,"confirmatory.with all the new implant sets (militia eccm sets, mid-pirate sets, etc.) that have been introduced we really need more jump clones."
11/29/2010,"lets talk about sunshine for a bit.the inverse square law:what that means, is that if a star is shining at the brightness of our sun at 2 aus distance in space (say, from the orbit of planet 2), then at 1 au (the orbit of planet 1), it should be 4 times brighter. this works in reverse as well. in eve, the inverse square law clearly doesn't apply, stars are a uniform brightness no matter how far away you are from them. the stars in new eden are ugly. they were ugly before the graphics revamp of them, they remain ugly now. this should not be an issue, they should be able to be ugly, because we shouldn't be able to see the ugly parts of them.why? because of light. it should be so damn bright near the stars that its impossible to see anything about them, the surface of your ship facing the sun should shine with an incandescent brilliance as the light from the star is reflected off the hull, leaving the back in apparent darkness and shadow. space would be black, no stars would shine, they should be utterly smothered by the light from the nearest sun.up close to the star, it should be like this, and as we back off further, the brightest stars start to come out, and if we move behind a moon, or planet, into the shadow, the nebulas appear. continuing out from the star into the night, the light fades, it becomes black, your ship being lit only by the fiery tail of its engine exhaust, the myriad of lights coming from the windows on its hull, and occasional glitter of weapons fire. the nebulas would shine faintly in the distance, the many stars would cast a ghostly glow down onto the hull. that is how space should be.that would be beautiful. that would convey the immense distance, seeing the star fade to blackness in the distance, space growing dim and dark. what we have now is nothing but a mockery of that, a sad shadow of something that should be monumentally impressive.i'm proposing that, if its feasible, a general boast to dynamic lighting systems be done across the board. we've seen what ccp is working on for incarna with ambient occlusion, lets see this technology applied to eve at large. make space truly awe inspiring in its vastness."
11/29/2010,"wow, there are some awesome ideas today.anything that makes the game better looking in a sensible way is good in my mind."
11/29/2010,"so you're saying that they should change the brightness of the sun so that the game is mostly unplayable if you warp to the sun or are at a planet within a few aus of the sun.sorry, but i don't see why this would be a good idea. i actually like to be able to see my ship when i warp to the sun instead of just blinding light from my monitor.maybe you've forgotten that this is a game."
11/29/2010,"if u wanna be feeling like ur playing a limited game then go play asteroids. or tetris, this is a space and social simulator."
11/29/2010,"supported, always hoped the ship would be a bit brighter when it's sitting right on the sun, we need a ""sunglass"" mode for when we do park our ship right by the sun though."
11/29/2010,"you can take some liberties to make gameplay more enjoyable and still keep things realistic. the info is transmitted to your pod through sensors, so there are likely filters used to help the pilot manage the data and avoid overloading his senses. minmatar also have cool aviator shade technology, so it is easy to think of realistic reasons why the brightness can be limited to help gameplay.that doesn't mean the basic idea isn't good. be generous with the lighting near the star and have mostly darkness with black space at the edge of the star system. it creates better atmosphere for starsystems and much needed variation, that also provides a sense of movement in space. it will also provide beautiful and dramatic visuals, since ship lights, firing guns and explosions are the only sources of light at the edges of a star system. a simple thing, but greatly improves the atmosphere of the game and provides much needed variation."
11/29/2010,i support this.more realistic + more playable + prettier = good plan.
11/29/2010,"since we're discussing realism1 au is typically not where planet 1 orbits - in our solar system it's where planet 3 (aka earth) orbits, on average.that said, your science is correct, and i wouldn't mind the change.however - being as our pods/technology are responsible for rendering the ""view"" outside our ships to us, how much of a change would this really make since i doubt that that view is being generated solely on visual data."
11/29/2010,"just shrink jump ranges in general back to pre-pre-pre-days... eve is damn small when you can cover it in just a few jumps.ccp already stated not once that they have full intention to reduce fleet bonuses to the grid range.one day, it will happen."
11/29/2010,"this is a stupid buff to something that doesnt need buffing.stoping thinking about ""what would be really cool"" and instead think about ""is this needed? how will it influence the game?"""
11/29/2010,do please explain why this doesn't need a buff?
11/29/2010,it won't with the ehp of the aeon and the dmg bonus of the nyx the benefit of both of those ships outway the reverant. in comparison to the aeon's ehp bonus it doesn't have an advantage in tank over this ship. the armor tanked nyx can deal similar dmg with the advantage of benefiting from rr in armor fleets.till sheild tanking battleship fleets are viable the reverant won't have as significant a role as it's non faction brothers. even then the wyvern with it's tanking bonus will still be the norm.it definatly needs something and having a unique role would make it a ship worth keeping. though i still wish they would fix sheild battleship fleets.
11/29/2010,"so i've been on a kinda break since the end of summer - just doing skill changes - then i watched the new trailer, and had that ""ooh, i wanna go play for a bit"" moment, and i saw the new ms model, and thought ""ooh, new shiny, me wanna haz"" - then i read the stats for it, and like most thought, wtf? srsly? you troll me right ccp? you troll me hard?but no, no troll :(totally supporting the need for the revenant to get re-examined... being a long standing fan of the nm, i'd hoped for, well, i dunno what, a wyvern with capital laser turrets maybe...ccp - you've really dropped the ball on this one, and you either need to very carefully and precisely explain each and every stat line for the current incarnation of the revenant, or scrap the current setup and start again...em."
11/29/2010,"strange, must be my eyes, but i can't find where i said it would never happen, particularly as the topic between us revolved around something quite different. but that's ok. let's try to not throw behaviour suitable for caod at the assembly hall alright?i agree the current implementation of the revenant leaves much to be desired. that being said, when looking at proposals to make something nice and useful out of it, we can't just look at the ship itself. you also need to think of its use, role, adoption and impact on eve.giving it a jumprange bonus, i can see the logic behind it, yes definately. it does however not strike me as the better angle to take. there's something to be said for concerns as mentioned in other posts here on 0.0 having become small ""as is"". don't get me wrong, i'd love it. but i can also see how it would make me want to go overboard with it, all the way. with the ship, and with numbers of ships. whether that is the smartest thing to do, i doubt it, 0.0 does have a bit of a history with how we take things into excess with ccp lagging behind trends created in the sandbox. same goes for something i personally would love to see. a ship which has the role of a supercarrier, with a little bite in the form of a portal function where it takes ships within proximity and in fleet along with it on deployments in the same jump. but yes, that's an entirely different ballgame."
11/29/2010,"i do agree that it needs something that is not its current bonus... and the more i think about it even though i'm certainly not in favor of encouraging hot dropping or blobbing, the jump range bonus makes alot of sense given the ship's intended role of an oversized capital marauder.the ship is already quite fragile, and i think the fact that it needs to be in-system in order to pass on this bonus would be a sufficient gimp to make people think twice about deploying it. on reflection it seems quite balanced."
11/29/2010,because it gives older alliances more power and it makes eve more bloby?
11/29/2010,what you mean this wtf ccp thread?oh wat...
11/29/2010,the bitter vets are the only reason new guys make it out of their steep learning curve in the early months. there were many bitter vets that supported the removal of learning skills. vets both for and against learning skills had those opinions to help the newer players. something newer guys need to remember.
11/29/2010,"and, in, summary, what is the proposal you want csm to raise with ccp?"
11/29/2010,"+1 to getting rid of learning skills. i've been thinking of where i'm going to stick the sp i get, for the past week. 2mil sp to move around is a crap ton of sp. right now as it stands i'm split between drones, or ewar. this is a very very hard decision."
11/29/2010,as someone who is both a bitter vet and has multiple characters with max learning skills i can whole heartedly say removing learning skills is the best thign ccp has done since warp to zero
11/29/2010,it takes about 250% longer to train without them. they are not optional.+1 for ignore bitter vets.
11/29/2010,i'm just fed up wasting time on learning skills when i create new characters. that it helps the new players is just an unfortunate side effect.
11/29/2010,"i take offense that bitter vets are being blamed as the ones against the removal of learning skills. bitter vets (like me) are the ones who complained about having to train learning skills on their 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc alt. that it benefits noobs means we can maybe get more noob friends in the game to meat shield for us."
11/29/2010,"exactly the view of most players who are 2.5+years in who skilled to lvl5s.and almost exactly the same goes for players 2.5 year in who didn't. they get their sp back and are happy to know that they never have to worry about anyone ever catching up with them.however if you are less than 12 months old and you actually planned to catch up with those players who are 2 years old and who didnt plan to lvl5 at the start, your hopes are dashed.and those saying ""there is no choice, everyone skills learning to lvl5's then you are full of bs, the average sp in learning skills is just over 2mill sp. not 5million as some keep stating.there were 3 ways to effect the sp/hr ratio, one of those has just been removed and that is a bad thing.why not just give all toons the ability to fly a drake in the first place if you want everyone to have fun out of the box...just removes an important aspect to skill planning and gives everyone a very static sp/hr ratio entrenching older players sp advantage.having said that, i agree with the changes, i just wish i hadnt wasted my time planning to do 2772sp/hr with the view that others were doing less and i would catch up.so essentially, this helps anyone already ahead and removes the only method of ever catching or surpassing someone regardless of your or their ability to play this game."
11/29/2010,"i agree that eve is selling their hard-core players for more 2/3 monthers - but the game has been moving in that direction for awhile no. . . so just sit back and watch all the dev efforts slowly shift to wod and thn they can really make a high turnover, mass profit, dad in 2/3 years easymode game.therre are other games, and30 bucks a month is not enough for me to quit over."
11/29/2010,"so what? so what if eve finally is friendly to people who don't sub for six months right away?in relative terms, those of us who stuck it out are not picky enough consumers, because we paid to wait to pay to play.it would be like (insert generic mmorpg) saying you have to level to 20 before you can have any abilities. except that (insert generic mmorpg) doesn't make getting level 20 take 4-6+ weeks."
11/29/2010,i can't wait to re-allocate all of my learning sp in two weeks time. i'm even training presence 5 in anticipation of it.
11/29/2010,ccp themselves stated learning skills were a mistake. you do realize this right?
11/29/2010,"learning skills suck. i've been playing for 3 years with 2 accounts and that does not change my opinion. they should be removed. so no, i do not support your proposal."
11/29/2010,"not supported.begone learning skills!eve needs a slightly less damaging noob-curve. the eradication of learning skills removes this, and places skill firmly into attribute allocation, however it removes the first month of boredom for noobs where you can't do anything but play wow or left4dead until learning is done.that is not fun. i know, because i've done it, and am proud to have all my learning skills to 5.i am delighted they're being removed so i can max out a pile of charisma-based skills i hate.removal of learning skills is win. of the epic type."
11/29/2010,"there is no downside to this removal. i've read the complaints and they are found either wanting or ignorant.nobody has lost any time here. because you're getting back those points, you'll basically be swapping the time you spent training learning skills for whatever time you save on what skills you apply the point reimbursement to. anyone who thinks otherwise can get bent.now stop ""wasting your time"" on something that unlike the plex debacle, ccp won't crumble on and go play the game you're paying for."
11/29/2010,"sorry if this is a repeat, but i didnt see anything relating to this or know of anyone else that actually run interbus missions.i have a few hundred thousand loyality points with interbus and a level 4 interbus agent, but there are no interbus stations. this seems really odd for a corp to not have a home base. i do know, that up in the genesis region, there is one system controlled by interbus, but no station there. it would be nice to have a place to use my loyality points.my suggestion would be to stick a station in that system they control, which will allow any cap pilot to turn in his/her points, but the reward will need to be new and different from all others. add in new transport ships - interbus specific, much like faction warships.add in new personal - trade goods.add in new cargo expanders - meta 6 and up.basically add in stuff that conicedes with transportation of goods and/or uses the knowledge of interbus. thanks."
11/29/2010,walking around in a pos i think is an excellent idea. i could see it now. you riding in an elevator to ho up the spire of the tower and then when you arrive at the top you can look out at your titan parked in the shields somewhere and your in a huge observation deck. would be really cool.
11/29/2010,i think something should be done indeed to make pos security more 'granular'.
11/29/2010,"this, i always turn the camera away and then get blinded when i warp past the sun."
11/29/2010,"dim definitely, perhaps something like in ""sunshine"" with the 'filtering' system."
11/29/2010,"supported.given ccp's focus on making eve as ""visually stunning"" as possible, utilizing ridiculously dated nebulae effects as a game mechanic (the maze springs to mind) is lazy, goddamn annoying and an oxymoron."
11/29/2010,dim bubble gum background too
11/29/2010,"eccm rigs, nice. but why not just have them increase sensor strength?the only thing to consider is that they would make unprobeable ships a lot easier to fit."
11/29/2010,"good idea -- one side is strengthened, both should be so it's balanced. how much of a benefit? that might need tweaking."
11/29/2010,i think straight sensor boost rigs would be a good idea.
11/29/2010,so what do the majority of the rest of rigs do?
11/29/2010,op mentioned ecm and eccm rigs. but if you totally insist you can ofc bring polycarbs and their relevance to ew into this discussion as well...
11/29/2010,"now this, this is a good idea."
11/29/2010,good idea
11/29/2010,i support this venture entirely
11/29/2010,"shiroi sneezessorry, i'm allergic to hypocrisy"
11/29/2010,"no. just... no.i can see you put a good deal of effort into this but it just doesn't pan out with all the changes you have. you did not cross-race compare to see what you did or you just decided caldari ew ships should be ""god mode""...these ship adjustments are poor ideas and the effect of ecm... unless you give it a burst style ""lose tracking then can reacquire 1 target"" -- no. no way in hell. i may not like it's op nature and ""the only ew drones worth using"" but these changes would make this worse than the sensor damp nerf while also granting caldari ew ships huge benefits for not using ecm... look at the griffin first and compare it to the maulus.griff (now): 2 missiles, 1 gun, 1 drone.maulus: 2 guns, 2 drones.your change puts 2 missiles, 1 gun -and- 3 drones -- 6 ""weapons"" on an ew frigate?!?!?in it's role, that 5% shield resists per level isn't bad -- mids burned by ew mods type situation. outside it's role; 4 mids... you made the griffin, used outside its role, potentially one of the better combat t1 frigates in the game.i'll just touch on your changes making caldari ew the longest ranged ew ships using all other race's ew... 150% optimal -and- falloff on sensor damps/tp's and turret disruptors for caldari?!?!? you just pushed the caldari ability to ewar through the roof when *not* using their racial ecm - they already have the longest targeting range of any ships in the game so now you give them the ability to use other races ew farther than those races can do with their own type?!?now -- in it's role -- 75% bonus to strength at the ship bonus level... would you like to show me any other ew frigate that gets anything near that kind of bonus to their ew? so i train caldari frigates to 2 so i can fly a griff and my ew picks up the strength bonuses that every other ew frigate has to be trained to 5 to obtain? ...your ""no get out of jail free"" idea... that feeds the gankers/gate campers eliminates a huge portion of ecm's viability at all. ""primary!"" -- ok, so i lose all targets except primary? not a bad deal there!!! i can ignore that type of ewar as any form of interference to my gate camp... the gankers dream - no protection from the gank by those using ecm!sorry - that doesn't work. it guts ecm down way too much and replaces it with all other types for caldari. i'm for modifying the stuff but not this way."
11/29/2010,"nice attempt. 2/10 for effort. here, have a kerchief with your hypocrisy... despite the damage control attempts in this thread you cannot really deny the fact that intially the op opened up all ew ships by his/her suggestion for changes. apparently only the caldari ones though. not insinuating any hidden motives (why, i never...) here, but quite obviously the inter-racial balance wasn't even worth a cursory thought in the theorycrafting done. that is, assuming that it was not the intention to totally screw up that balance solely in favor of caldari ew ships... and sorry to say, i'm not at all thrilled by the advent of wtfbbq caldari ew ships ""to rule them all"". ymmv..."
11/29/2010,"i've been saying much the same thing for a while. my solution to the current state of ecm was actually just posted here.the main differences are:it always succeeds.you're unable to lock the ship jamming you. (optional: you can lock the ship jamming you if your sensor strength is greater than the strength of the jammer)eccm is changed to increase scan resolution, and to increase the number of targets you can lock by one (even while being jammed).the only boost to ecm ships is one that increases their standing power."
11/29/2010,"various ships listed show this or similar. what do the celestis, bellicose, arbitrator etc gain in return for giving the caldari boats non-racial ewar bonuses?i do like the idea of ecm reducing max targets though- maybe each module reducing by a fixed amount rather than setting to 1, that allows for variations/t2 etc, and might also make multitasking 5 more useful..."
11/29/2010,definately not supported.
11/29/2010,"i've rattled my brain a bit on the issue, and i can't think of any balancing solution to the current situation without either being:a) completely ineffectiveb) so overpowered it directly destroys assets of a character.though with things progressing the way they have, the latter option might be the only real potential solution.lets be honest, all power in the game is directed into the hands of a few select alliances and corporations and the few characters that control them. these organizations in turn sit in the best space, take the best moons, resources, bpo's, systems, whatever they like, and horde assets. they maintain puppet alliances around them, splitting 0.0 primarily but even empire space into factions pro this or pro that. there is hardly a system in the game lacking this influence, the only exceptions being systems these organizations have written off as 'not worth the effort'. with these assets, the major alliances sit on their space uncontested, and can only be challenged by another of their kind. no other organization has the assets, the income, not to mention the capital and super capital fleets large enough to take on such an alliance. the 'sandbox' of eve, the self described open universe of a game, is truly closed. you must know someone to get in. even if you don't want in, you must know someone who is, because everyone else does. how can you not, when these alliances can drop in 20 supercaps or hundreds of paid mercenaries on a whim, without even batting an eye at the potential cost?why? because they don't care. they don't care if they lose 20 supercaps. they don't care if they lose 100. why would they? with assets and reserves and income like that, it can all be replaced. to them at least, anyone else would be bankrupt by such a loss. one could take all players not immediately involved in 0.0 alliances and compare them to just one of these major organizations, all the thousands of them in empire space, add their collective incomes and still not match the 0.0 alliance.even besides all of aspects of the game created by player influence, there remains the countless changes by ccp to help these major alliances in their continued domination of every aspect of the game. recent improvements to 0.0 incomes for example, infrastructure improvements, constant tearing of minerals, plexes, pirates and planets in favor of 0.0 systems. the complete inability for players to have access to a super capital without sovereignty, much less the ability to afford one ensures that only the most powerful can obtain these ships. and yet, even in changes and additions ccp would call 'fair and balanced', the equation still favors these major alliances. factional warfare is now practically an extension of proxy 0.0 wars, each faction backed by a particular alliance. recent incursions in tyrannis have been even worse. any system not in high security space was either completely locked down by a 0.0 alliance at the time of the incursion, controlled by proxy by a factional warfare group, or most recently, completely ignored because 0.0 alliances realized there was no profit to be gained by them. why does no one else show up you ask? because these alliances have already ruined this new aspect of the game for everyone else. ccp's ""solution"" is to do nothing, or to blatantly assist the very alliances that hold power over the rest of the players. no doubt because gm's still maintain characters in these alliances, and yet claim no conflict of interest? so, that is the problem. glaringly obvious as it is.what is the solution? i don't know if there is one.any possibility would likely be incredibly complicated, effect nearly every aspect of gameplay and would take months to hash out. but perhaps now is a good time to get started? haven't these organizations ruined the game for long enough?"
11/29/2010,"first in what will be an epic flame fest.they worked hard to get where they are, if you can get more people to follow you and out blob a small o.o alliance and take space you are in. then make allies and start a war to expand your territory. this is the end game of eve and it is not easy to have your corp fly your flag as the leader of an empire.work for it and stop worrying about super caps that will die like anything else if you apply enough numbers to the problem. oh and if an alliance lost 20 they would care."
11/29/2010,"you make your problem obvious, but you have no proposal to offer at all, even though you marked the thread as a proposal. at this point in the thinking process general discussion or features and ideas forums might be a better choice, since you are just basicly asking others to give out their ideas. after you have something you think might be worthy of implementing with slight tweaks, come back here and we can discuss it and vote on it."
11/29/2010,"once upon time there was no alliances in game. however regardless of that there were entities that people knew by their names. curse alliance, querious defence force to name a two, all it takes is select few people meet in the poorly lit room, exchange few nods and so things happen. if for example black avatar and imperium tehnologies ceo's meet in such room (to say .. make for example ""chat channel"" called qdf) there is not a lot ccp can do about it. and all the sudden if you go and take a bite out of black avatar assets shortly afterwards you find that imperium technologies guys just accidentaly happened to pass by, see you as bigger threat and gank you with black avatar guys. it was before my time ofc. point is however, that if you prevent in game ways of coordinating it will be done out of the game, putting 'small guys' at even greater disadvantage as they probably lack the out of the game infrastructure. not everyone can afford a teramspeak server that can take thousand clients connecting to it, while eve-voice is free and usable even by 'small guys'."
11/29/2010,is there supposed to be some sort of proposal behind this?
11/29/2010,i'm assuming something like 'nerf the nc they are strong and mean '
11/29/2010,"i feel your pain on this, but to change it would change eve. sure, groups like the nc control vast amounts of territory and resources but it wasn't always that way and it probably won't always be that way. bob once controlled ridiculous amounts of power too but because of the game's mechanics and not in spite of them, bob self destructed. that is the fundamental ebb and flow of eve."
11/29/2010,totally agree this is a game-breaking problem that will be the downfall of eve! ccp better act fast or the game will be no more in a mere ~18 months~! oh... wait... i thought you were talking about lag... nvm then... ibtl as the proposal proposes... nothing?
11/29/2010,lets get more supporters people!
11/29/2010,they were awesome
11/29/2010,"engine trails. plus thunder and lighting of capital jump and old cynos. look at the start video of eve, have you ever wondered what is this lighting reflected from the eye in the beginning. yup - thats the old cyno/capital jump. it would be pathetic, if you would see reflection of the new effect in there."

11/29/2010,"supported. since my alts are all on one account, this would make it a little easier to switch to them for managing industry jobs, etc."
11/29/2010,"am of two minds on this one. you need to have some form of cooldown timer though, if only to prevent abuse of it. that said, we've been needing a proper logoff mechanic forever"
11/29/2010,well it used to exist - a loooooong time ago - but was removed because it killed the client in the end
11/29/2010,"under trade goods, we have alot of personal standing around do nothing. ""slackers"" granted, some stations demand some, but other then that, the exotic dancer gets all the attention.i suggest adding slots in ships to add personal to your crew.they will act like rigs, but can be removed and replaced at anytime. plus, they do not give negative, only positive. the postivie will need to be a small %, but enough to attract people to use them.for example - scientist - give 5% bonus to mining, scanning, probing.militia - give 5% bonus to attack strength of certain weapon type.etc....now with slaves, since they are used mainly by amarr, can only be used by amarr and one of the personal slots will have to be filled with a slaver hound or a slave handler, of sorts, but slaves give a 3% bonus to everything. (example)this will add another phase to eve, one which i think is good. it will require charisma to be used more, since all skills needed to actually use personal will require it as the primary attribute. this will give new meaning to role players, make it to where your race actually means something, and will increase the traffic for personal use in game.not quite sure about exotic dancer, but i am sure someone can help determine the right bonus for her/him."
11/29/2010,"since driving from work, i thought of a twist to this, to make it interesting.when your ship goes down, your crew escapes with you in your pod. now if you get podded, then your crew can be rescued and used by the enemy, if they survive. make pod killing alittle more worth while."
11/29/2010,"i realize that there is already an existing thread in favor of the ccp-announced plan to removing learning skills. however, i'm not comfortable with characterizing those who disagree as ""bitter veterans"". thus, with no offense intended to ""herping yourderp"", i would like to start a separate thread to express support for ccp's chosen course of action.we, the undersigned, believe that ccp chose a good method for removing learning skills and compensating both current and future players for the removal of said skills, and further believe that the game will be better as a result. some amongst the undersigned may disagree about whether the method chosen by ccp was the best method for addressing issues related to the learning skills, but we all do agree that it is a good method in that it will be an improvement over the present situation, and wish for ccp to continue either in the manner that it was described in the above-linked developer blog, or in some manner very similar to what was announced.thank you."

11/29/2010,complete and utter waste of time...all your doing is causing more trolling.yes... i too support ccp's decision... but enough of this crap. stfu about it already people... whats done is done. you can't change ccp's mind... no one can... saying anything more than whats already been said hundreds of times is a total waste of time.
11/29/2010,"this imo has to be the longest problem in eve history, the logs are not showing anything, havent been showing anything for a long time and by the looks of it wont be showing anything.we need the logs fixed"
11/29/2010,"i am going to guess you had a ship reimbursement petition get rejected.that aside, what should the logs show? everything everyone does in game? do you realize how much additional load that would put on the servers? you think we have lag now.the logs need to show enough to allow ccp to show when they have had an actual problem on their (the server's) end. no more (and certainly no less)."

11/29/2010,what a bunch of unimaginative whiners.minmatar - tracking disruption to maximize speed advantagecaldari - target painting to maximize missile damagegallente - ecm. i'm at a bit of a loss on this one. i'll go with it gives the drones time to work and maximizes time to get in close with blasters.amarr - sensor damps to maximize range advantage of lasers
11/29/2010,but that would make too much sense. we can't have that in eve.
11/29/2010,"on the one hand, that's a decent idea.on the other hand, expect the prices of falcons to crash and burn horrendously. also, expect a lot of whining about how now caldari is even more useless in pvp."
11/29/2010,you have missed the point of racial ewar by a huge margin here. i'll explain why:gallente like to engage at very close range so they use sensor damps to shape the battlefield and force enemy ships into close range fighting where gallente should always win (lol blasters!). secondary ewar is long range warp disruption. pretty useful when you're using scramblers but its a bit weird that the fed navy scrams arn't the longest rangeamarr use tracking disruption so that very fast targets can't track (minnies) forcing them to slow down where lasers can track. remember my transversal = their transversal. secondary ewar is energy neuts. this prevents the use of mwd's and active tanks. something the minnies like to use.minmatar use target painting to maximise dps and assist with turret tracking. webs also assist with creating a speed advantage. this is how they fightcaldari get ecm. thats just the way it goes. they also don't get a secondary ewar. they put all their eggs into the ecm basket hence the double bonus to ecm on falcons and the likes.

11/29/2010,"as the owner of a new indy toon(less than a year) i was hoping to make myself t2 rigs and t2 ships. while able to invent such items building them is costly because of the need to get moon harvested products. was just wondering why empire space was out of bounds. couldn't it be simular to belts and pi? the higher the sec the lower the income? yes, i know im just looking to ease my own cost some, but it would be nice if i could eat away as much of the build cost as i could."
11/29/2010,wrong forum to post in.and your too noob [young] to be making that proposal.moon mining while nerfed some time back is still profitable enough to be a problem in high sec.go to low sec/0.0 to get your moons.
11/29/2010,"it was more of a question in wonder, rather than expecting it anything to happen. just smacks alittle that i have a pos on a moon but cant pull back alittle income from it. but like all things in eve with time comes more new things, and the leaving of empire behide to seek vast new incomes in the lawlessness(damn hard to say) worlds."
11/29/2010,why then clutter the ah forums?there would had been gd or si forums for this..
11/29/2010,moved from assembly hall as this is more about discussion than a proposal.
11/29/2010,"you don't need moons to make t2 anything.if you chose this option i'd add, bring friends."
11/29/2010,ummm yes you do??????also empire dwellers dont deserve things like minable moons. bad enough concord protects you
11/29/2010,"its the same reason they don't let you mine moons in wh space. taking towers out in high sec is a bear, especially if its an ecm star. ccp didn't want anyone to have a permanent safe isk trickle with no danger."
11/29/2010,"so what you're saying is that you feel eve should be upgraded to a dx11 renderer? i agree. i mean, wow can do it, why can't eve?"

11/29/2010,"i stand to lose billions of isk profits to this change. because i was building a character manufacturing system based on the idea that people hate training learning skills. buy a character with them already maxed and you can play as if you never had to train them at all. but when dec 14th comes along, i'll have to find a different way to make those billions.so believe me when i say, sod the learning skills and any idea that keeps them."
11/29/2010,"because the other t2 bpo proposal is garbage, how about something more interesting: t2 bpo beacons. the bpos become unusable in npc stations, and whatever else they're stored in shows up on the overview like a cyno beacon. also, they'd be viewable on the star map with a new filter. that way, if you want one, or just want them out of the game, you can go kill it."

11/29/2010,damn...i'm trying to picture that. it just doesn't work...how is the forehead coming out of their mouth...and how can you see the mouth if his head is up his ass that far?the answer to this is more important than anything previously discussed in this thread.

11/29/2010,oh look...somebody else who doesn't know what he's talking about.
11/29/2010,oh lookanother goon. how strange for a goon to want a reduction in skill training. biggest whiners in eve.
11/29/2010,you have no idea...one goon runs out of cheetos or mountain dew and then that's all we hear about for hours on end.
11/29/2010,"tbh i don't see what everyone's complaining about. learning skills were never that complex to begin with, given that the rule of thumb was pretty much ""if you're playing eve for more than a month, train your learning skills."" why people go on and on about how it's ruining the complexity of eve is beyond me. i remember when i first started playing, i loaded up for my first level one mission, taking out an incursis with some 125 rails and antimatter. i remember going into the mission, and wondering why it was i couldn't f**king hit anything. my friend then sat me down, and explained the mechanics of the combat system to me. optimal range, falloff, tracking speed, transversal velocity. i remember thinking ""what the everloving f***? you mean i have to factor all this crap in before i can so much as hit something?""compare that to your average mmo, where hitting something basically amounts to ""get biggest stick/boomstick you can, click on enemy, lulz ensue."" if anything the biggest hit to the complexity of the game came to us in the form of eft, which so nicely tells us exactly what fitting out a ship a certain way will do for us (and even then, think of the amount of numbers eft spits out at you. seriously, go open it up and just look at them all)to all the people whining about the learning skill removal: they're a pain in the butt, they're practically mandatory so the argument of depth/complexity is a sham, and making eve a teeny, tiny bit easier to get into at the lower end really shouldn't be that big of a deal you whiny little ****s."
11/29/2010,the smokey smokey... it is not a good combination with the forums. go deal with those munchies and head to bed and leave the talking to everyone else. :)
11/29/2010,"learning skills weren't complex, they were filler skills. that is all. just something else to train in the long list of other skills. the only problem is, these skills did not directly affect your trade, combat or social skills. when you finished a month of training, your ship flew no faster, could use no new pieces of equipment, you could not buy or sell for more or less, nor were there any other visible differences except that you trained more quickly. it was a bad idea to skip em unless you were a low sp specialized char and it was a real bore to train em.all together, it isn't a loss. i'll enjoy putting that 1.8 mil sp elsewhere."
11/29/2010,wasting a month learning how to learn faster meant lots of new players got put off playing eve.from a financial point of view ccp's accountants decided learning skills were counter intuitive and therefore cost them alot of possible income via new subs.nerfing learning skills and replacing them with base attribute increases means more noobs might actually train proper useful skills during thier trial and are therefore more likely to sub.downside is now macros haulers can be trained in even less time.how?gallente destroyer in 2 days --- triple cargo rigged + 3x t2 cargo expanders = 943m3 gallente cruiser in 4 days --- exequror with 3x t2 cargos + 3x cargo rigs = between 1900m3 and 2500m3 cargo hold depending on gal cruiser skill level
11/29/2010,the loss of the 100% sp bonus helps a bit on that.
11/29/2010,"actually, the devs have gone on record saying that they think adding new stuff will bring in more subscribers than actually completing the development of current stuff (fixing the ui, fixing the sp curve, etc). while they've gone back on that a bit recently, i think it's still the governing philosophy."
11/29/2010,"and? it's been that way for the past 7 years. they constantly jump from feature to feature. it's not new, and any argument that says eve is dying because they are only focus on getting new players is flawed if the governing philosophy of the company hasn't changed for 7 tears. this is nothing new people, cosmos missions? i mean come on, are you saying the reason they never worked on them wasbecause they didn't care about the older players and just wanted new ones? there were no ""old"" players.ccp just has adhd, they freaking love new features, and always have. and while some really big features have been left behind, i thinka. it might be the reason they do so well, the game is changing so much it's kinda addicting to see what random new thing is going to randomly completely change the game.b.despite eve is dying posts, every expansion there is also a patch page as long as this thread with fixes and changes to old content. that stuff just never gets advertised."
11/29/2010,"i don't think eve is dying... in fact, i'm relatively certain eve has more people now than ever before. however, i do like new features as it keeps players around. while i wish that they would at least split part of their dev team off (even just 2 or 3 people) to focus entirely on fixing the game, these new features are bringing in players left and right.the end result of eve is just as important to our enjoyment now as later. think about it- the more players we get at this moment the more folks we'll have to fight and play with. the more players there are, also, the better chance another company down the road, long after eve has shut down, will look at eve and say ""i like the concept of this game. let's give it a try"". sadly, in mmo standards, 50,000-100,000 subscribers for a space game isn't as big of a money maker as say a cookie cutter fantasy wow-ripoff that can drag in several hundred thousand+. as players, it's all the same to us, but it would be nice to give companies incentive to keep making space games. :)"
11/29/2010,"well to be fair eve online has 350,000 players, more that city of heroes, final fantasy 11/14, warhammer online, ect.and while i agree with everything your saying, i argue you to consider that they always release fixes, over 100-200 per expansion. it's just that ccp when they look at say... factional warfare (ugh) they see fixing a feature that big as useless, they would rather opt for waiting 2 years and redesigning it from scratch. it's more of a mindset thing."
11/29/2010,just another example of ccp putting profit before the culture of their game
11/29/2010,they work reasonably well. i dont recall any promises that they could eradicate all blobs forever.you're looking for a technical fix to human behaviour. these rarely if ever work.
11/29/2010,good luck doing much to a supercap blob with mere bombers. unless you outblob them massively with numbers. but then again you'd face the conundrum... bigger blob > blob = bring moah numbers. *shrug*
11/29/2010,i don't personally know of any dev posts exhaustively detailing the ccp vision for local and justifying its current state.you could try and track down some 2~ year old recordings of ccp zulupark (and another 2 devs i forget) open discussions on balance issues following his superb 'whats wrong with the game' (i paraphrase) thread. local being an omniscient intel tool that ruins attempts at stealthy gameplay was touched upon there.
11/29/2010,"hey, if they replaced the d scanner with a real time 'radar' system that did the equivalent of hit d scanner every 5 seconds that might work; or every 10 seconds if using more than half of the currently available 14 au, part of the current issue in wh's is people doing a site can align and get into warp before a hunter has dropped out of warp. if they want to get all fancy there is even the possibility of tying 'd scanner/radar' hits to sensor strength/sig radius of ships so .i may also become queen of england."
11/29/2010,removing local is just a boost to blobbing.
11/29/2010,"thanks for the dev pointer, helped immensely."
11/29/2010,"there is only a ""tiny"" problem. 50.000 d scanner querying the server every 2 seconds. if you recall a couple years ago a cooldown period was introduced for the d scanner because the number of queries from people mashing it constantly was giving the server troubles. make it a system that run constantly like your suggested radar and server usage will spike horrendously."
11/29/2010,"hmm... correct me if i'm wrong, but wouldn't delayed local be perfect for macroers? i mean, if you're using a macro, you'll hide yourself deep into 0.0 territory in a dead-end, rarely visited system and fire it up. hunters that want to get you would not even know if you are in local until they scan the system. right now, with local in place, you can travel through a fair amount of systems and check the local to see if anyone is there. you can even scout the targeted area and gather intel on who's in which system during a certain part of the day making a list of players using macros easier to create. macroers tend to work in low populated areas of space, so in many systems you, as a hunter will be alone. if you're alone in the system, you'll just quickly skip it and proceed to another system looking for targets. however, if we take local out of the picture, gathering intel about potential players that are using macro software to rat will be much harder, boring and time consuming than it is now. in other words, it will discourage hunters.macro software will just evolve and adapt to the situation. assuming that the macro software uses local as an intel tool in low populated areas (which is the main argument for your claim), you must realize that, from a programming point of view, there's no difference between gathering intel from local or from any other source. take the directional scanner for example. if the directional scanner, modified or in current form, would be the new intel gathering tool, then not only that you are effectively hiding macroers in low populated areas (like i described earlier), but you are making them even more invincible than they are now. a software that makes d-scanner refresh requests in the minimum time intervals allowed by the game mechanics will always be more effective than a human. in addition, there's the server load problem (or cpu per user). any active intel gathering tool that sends a request to the server to get the information (unlike ""watching"" local which is passive) will increase server resource consumption per user. naturally, macro users will then make even bigger problems because their time effective automated software will consume much higher amounts of resources than the regular ineffective human.in the end, just let me say (i'm sorry in advance for this, but it must be said), justifying requests to change fundamental game mechanics (good or bad) that we all used for years by mentioning defense from illegal macro users is more or less pathetic. not a single game mechanic that even a single legitimate paying customer uses in his every day gaming is worth changing by justifying it with ""anti-macro"" fight. legitimate users should not ever ""take one for the team"" when it comes to fighting against macroers. if a game mechanic is bad, or could be made better, the only valid arguments must include legitimate players only.anti outo/"
11/29/2010,"thats not what is said now is it? it was not a couple of years ago, it was far more recent that an actual cooldown was added.people only use the d scanner frequently in 0.0 and w spacehaving it only auto-on in 0.0 and wh's and manual as it is now in empire (or in other words, empire will be exactly as it is now) would not dramatically increase server load if an appropriate time interval between query's was chosen- people are used to having a foolproof (and idiot proof) warning that someone else is near them, an automatic d scan of ~20 seconds between activations would still give people ample time to react to threats.adding further safeguards whereby systems with more than 300 people in them had d scan implemented as a manual tool would further help matters.in addition, the server load generated by the d scanner before the cooldown was a consequence of macro's making requests several times a second.lastly, having a sov upgrade that gave you empire like local channels (as they are now) that made the d scan manual would be a good step- it would give alliances a greater degree of safety in exchange for not having the much more lucrative isk generating sov upgrades in that system.you seem to be misconstruing the facts here a little."
11/29/2010,"i am perfectly aware you were pushing for your ""hunter advantage"" proposing the 5 or even 10 seconds timer and half range. currently it is 1.3 seconds unless i have missed a change and it was 2 seconds when it was nerfed. 5 second for 7 au is a long timer. 2 second timer was implemented apocrypha 1.5, released 20 august 2009, i.e. 14 months ago. it fall decently within the ""couple of years"" mark. no mention of ""0.0 only"" change in your previous post and honestly i doubt a automated in 0.0/not automated outside of 0.0 systems will work. at most it would be a activate/deactivate d scanner option and everyone will keep it activated (you know, carebears use it to check for ninja looter in theirs missions, low sec people to find probes and so on). 20 seconds now? make it 24 hours. maybe you should read a bit on how fast probes can find a ship. probably you know that perfectly and that is the reason why you want to push the timer up."
11/29/2010,"if you want it implemented as an automatic measure in 0.0 only, just tie it to the sov structure/upgrades stuff? what did we get that tcu/sbu/whatever crap for else? if you're fine with 25 second sweep, okay, lvl 1 upgrade will do. if you want a 5 second one, sure, get lvl 5 and pay the cost (hell, yeah, sure some muppet will now complain 5 seconds are waaaaay to long and call the waaambulance. it's an example of how it could work, ffs). that way you don't hand the advantage of that ""automated"" scan/radar/whatever on a platter to every macro and put some risk vs. reward ratio into the equation by charging more isk for more effective scans in the system.and before anyone now claims that will lag out all of nullsec to kingdom come... got any facts to prove that?"
11/29/2010,"while i agree that csm/player engagement on the forums is somewhat lacking (i am guilty myself), it's a fact that there is only so much time in the day that can be devoted to csm stuff. the conversations that take place in the internal csm forums are often process-related or bound by nda constraints; they cannot feasibly involve nor be shared with players but they are a vital element in the effectiveness of the csm. i feel the csm should do more to keep players informed about their routine activities. inspired by one such request, i am attempting to address that information gap with the recently created csm5 activity update wiki page. it might be worthwhile to list the discussion topics we are addressing with devs under ongoing projects, including which ccpians are involved. i need to ask our ccp advocates if this is okay to do. but i think players might find that interesting...especially if the topic status is identified (active, inactive, concluded).also, fwiw, i do try when upvoting or opposing ah proposals to make a comment or two about reasons for my support (or lack of it). sometimes the benefits of a proposed change are so blatantly clear that not much needs to be said."

11/30/2010,"this is a cool proposal and would add some really good dynamicism to some elements of the game.i can see why some people dont like the mechanical change, but i think theres some confusion...warp charge time would require total alignment and is a replacement to the slow ramp up in speed when a target is invunerable in warp. whether bumping could occur at that point is debatable.. as physically a warp bubble would be acting on the ship. any1 talking about bumping to prevent warp would have had the oppertunity to do so normally, u cant bump forever guys! the charge time should be indicated by an effect similar (but not related to) being webbed etc... its the rapid deceleration that i think could be an issue cause the data collection and display of graphical elements elements would have to be almost instant client side. at the moment its ramped up and the clinet computer is allowed time to crunch numbers to display properly. how a sudden punch in to full graphics would work with many computers would be debatable. as well as the effects of someones ship idle in space for a second or two while their computer catches up, could result in some rage! in a perfect world id be 2 thumbs up.. 2 big toes up and another but its gonna need a lil more deep thought to see if it's gonna work well in biiiig fights when ur computer has to sweat profusely to crunch numbers rediculoously fast to stop u idling.the only way i can see is if your computer starts the number crunching to display everything properly early before the server tells everyone else ur there. that can spiral a lil out of control with client computers crunching numbers for a scene thats not fully composed, due to other players clients not identifying themselves there.all in all we would need a lot more info on actually how the client and server communicates to see if the load would work without lag or excessive idle times, to see if theres room to squeeze this in! and that can only be done by having a csm raise it to the devs at ccp. for that reason alone... +1 from me for sure!!"

11/30/2010,"i kind of like the idea. a couple issues i see with it:1. even though the game is moving slower, that won't stop people from spamming buttons. think about the classic video gamer leaning irl to in response to the turning in game not being fast enough. or, a better example is games with bullet time. really, how many people spam the keys anyway? i know i do ""jump faster, jump faster!"" so, that would still need to be addressed on the client end i think (accepting the first click and not accepting another of the same command until the server has responded).2. there will still be metagaming. i remember in iac when we would be told to jet can ammo as fast as we could and have our drones out shooting to bring down the node so mc couldn't take out stations before our reinforcements got to us. same would be true, whether by that old trick (i think gms get annoyed when people do that) or simply dropping a bunch of carriers and super carriers into a system and dumping drones to slow it down.3. nodes. unfortunately, each system is not hosted on a single server. so, unless the system was reinforced by ccp, making a server laggy effects multiple systems. so, we might run into a random large fight in 0.0 and cause a bunch of mission/plex runners to experience this slow down (or will they just experience the node death they currently experience)? keep it to only reinforced nodes and you are missing half the laggy situations.i still like the idea. just thought it would be nice to point out some cons."

11/30/2010,"currently, if you join a fleet with an armor mindlinked commander you transparently aquire 15% extra armor hp, magically improving your armor plates instantly. no repping required.if you do the same with a shield (siege) mindlink, however, your current shield total remains the same and you have 15% shield damage. you will need to repair this to get the benefit of the additional hp, be it through patience or active repping.then it gets worse--if your commander disconnects, passes control to another, or some other fleet organization changes, or you simply jump into the next system you lose the extra shield, and even if your bonus-giver has equivalent (or less) of a bonus, you need to regenerate/repair it as if from scratch, again.armor bonuses? shift fleet all you want. reduces/augments your armor total on the fly.for smaller ships this is usually mitigated within a few minutes. for battleships it can take longer, and forget about ever seeing your extra shield bonus if you're in a capital ship jumping into a firefight. one can only laugh if you get a leviathan bonus; you'll be at 60% shields and need a triage carrier remote repairing you if you hope to see 100% shields anytime soon.on top of this free hp boost, armor tankers even have an implant set to improve their armor total even more. that's fine; shield and armor tanking are different and i like the diversity (raw hp vs regenerated). but for gang bonuses the difference in behavior is just too disruptive to be remotely equated.change the shield fleet bonuses to be applied instantly and completely like other gang bonuses."

11/30/2010,"i thought it might have been brought up before, but lol searching eve forums.after reading that, however, i noticed that the arguments against it are specious--especially the ""free t2 shield recharger"" one. armor bonuses give two free t2 regenerative plate modules, effectively.additionally, the passive tanking argument, while somewhat valid, is also less of an issue. yes, you tank slightly harder thanks to the gang bonus, but the worst case scenario--a mindlinked leviathan boosted brick drake gang--is both unlikely to be seen and can be addressed with the ""compromise"" of a recharge time penalty added to the leviathan. a mindlink alone doesn't have that dramatic an effect.edit: plus drakes buffed like that would have massive sigs and be very susceptible to bombs."

11/30/2010,"same thing that happens when you do this with armor ships and armor bonuses. the ""it's unfair since shield tanks get passive recharge"" argument is honestly nothing but pure bs. passive recharge is one of the advantages that shield tanking as a whole gets to make up for its disadvantages, like difficulty in fitting ewar, tackle and anti-ewar like eccm. the gang bonus is then supposed to boost the gangs shield tank as a whole, not only a very specific part of it that is very rarely used in situations where you actually have gang bonuses.passive tanks would not be affected by this change since the first 10-15% shield is pretty irrelevant to them anyway since recharge is almost 0 up there and they already get the recharge rate boost from getting increased maximum shield, but it would help make shield buffered ships more viable."

11/30/2010,"your logic never ceases to amaze me. but at least it is an interesting pattern. when someone's post does not fit the shout, just slightly twist the route or the message untl it's back where you want it hilarious how you keep doing that"
11/30/2010,"it seems a legitimate question. also if you look at 0.0 it's predominately older alliances. even providence is being taken over by ev0ke, an incredibly old alliance. right now 0.0 is about as unfriendly as it could be for a new alliance. the few new alliances i have seen try to move in within the last 3 years(with the exception of test) were removed with extreme force. why would a ship make this worse? this would suggest you can kill a man who is already dead. as for the anti blob statement. ccp likes blobs, they support and encourage them. they put a sizable amount of money into helping larger and larger groups of players to ""blob"". so the idea that blobbing = bad is unfortunately not shared by ccp. they think there should be alternatives for people but so far as small groups effecting sov goes. well we know how that ends anyways. the fact you simply try to dismiss what i say is telling. if you have nothing to add i would welcome you to simply not respond, but i appreciate the bump so argue away."
11/30/2010,"see, now that was almost a good reply, but in the last paragraph you seemingly could not avoid falling prey to the same old habit. i did not dismiss what you said, at all. but argue away, at least it is a twist on someone's post that brings a smile on people's faces edit. on the note of ccp liking blobs. it may look that way. but that's just a consequence of lack of affinity due to distance from experiencing these things directly, and well, lack of vision and maybe a little willpower to deal with such things. it's perfectly possible to deal with things, but that is a totally different debate ..."
11/30/2010,"or it could be that the game itself is designed so we can have those sorts of large fleet fights. in fact that's how balancing has been shifting towards. they stated repeatedly at the last fan fest they enjoy both taking part and having take place, the large fleet fights in eve. you can assume they have a disconnect from not playing all you want. but the fact is that many devs do play the game. they just aren't permitted to let people know they do. ccp stated they wanted small gangs to be able to effect sov but obviously the dominion system is as unfriendly to small gangs as pos warfare is to solo battleships. i think to say ccp dislikes blobs out of ignorance is in itself ignorance. ccp stated they want all kinds of warfare to be both important and playable. small, large, guerrilla, and previously unused tactics that we simply havent thought up or encountered yet. does dominion discourage all but large? very nearly. does this mean this ship will make things worse? no. it would mean a few things. while you yourself may dislike blobs, not everyone does. maybe everyone in your circle does, maybe everyone you talk to does. that does not mean it's a universal truth. i know numerous people who literally only play the game for large scale combat. why should my game play be less valid than yours?1st) a fleet looking to hotdrop a target past the edge of their unbuffed range would have to gather in one system. i know nothing of you or any alliance you may play for but i am in the habit of supercaps logging into different systems and even different constellations with the target in mind so they are harder to track and lock down. 2nd) if you are saying that this would in fact encourage blobbing *more* you would be implying people aren't already bringing everything they can to a fleet. i think this is patently false. if you know a fleet fight is coming you move within range or within the midpoints range before that time. a ship that enhanced this would in fact do no harm to this practice. if you are implying there would be supermobile supercap fleets then i would have to only chuckle at you. only one alliance in the game that i know of routinely moves its supercap fleet around eve and i think balancing the game around one group of players is silly at best."

11/30/2010,hey i covered that exact complaint in the post directly above yours.
11/30/2010,"look at the trend for the scale of battles in eve (only tracked the battles where people were able to shoot each other). ccp puts a lot of effort into making these ever increasingly larger battles happen. they report these battles as indirect pats on their backs. their advertising focuses on these giant battles. they call it a massive multiplayer for a reason, the more people involved, the better.anyway, this bonus would likely cause a different thing to happen. smaller, faster, more spontaneous fights. the faster things can move around in eve, the less time people have to build up fleets, the smaller the blobs."

11/30/2010,"^^ i think someone moved his cheese...i support the removal of these useless skills.they presented a down right annoying barrier of entry. without them new players can spend training time on relevant skills, rather than training to train faster. remaps and implants allow for the improved benefits for those that want it.i cant tell you how many new players (and people trainign alts) have cringed at the idea fo having to spend 2-3 months before they can train skills at a reasonable rate.."
11/30/2010,"it makes me laugh that you assume all ""hardcore"" or old players think learning skills were so awesome. my character has 73mil sp, i've been playing since 06 and i've always thought they were pants on head ******ed. removing learning skills wont make the game easier. it will simply be the removal a very bad piece of game design that shouldn't have been in eve in the first place. it doesn't make anything easier except the first 2 weeks of grind. if you guys are so attached to hazing maybe you should join a fraternity. brofist."
11/30/2010,the only thing 'hard' about learning skills is convincing yourself to keep your sub active while training them.
11/30/2010,learning skills = 2-3 months of blasting your thrusters in place for long-run training speed increase.new system - removal of learning and refunding sp then adding in +12 unremappable base stats = faster base training overall and you get to spend the wasted points in more critical skills.read the dev blogs before you spout your nonsense in the forums.
11/30/2010,"is this correct?from the dev blog i got only this:""2,012,692 sp in learning, you will find yourself down those skills, but with 2,012,692 skillpoints to redistribute.""i didn't catch any reference to getting more?"
11/30/2010,lets introduce the equivelent of effective skill points.your getting 5.5m effective skill points ( everyone is ).2m ( that you have in current learning ) you will get in the form of redistibutable skill points.3.5m you will get in the equivelent of attribute boost ( as if ccp magically boosted all you learning skill to max ).
11/30/2010,"to the guy who mentioned that removing the learning skills will be unfair to those who ""didn't"" invest in them, the math simply doesn't support his argument.let's assume, for the sake of this argument, that there are two capsuleers with 70mil sp each. one has invested 2mil sp for learning skills, the other never did invest in them. once the learning skills are removed and any sp invested into them have been reimbursed for allocation (as per the developers), the capsuleer who invested those 2mil sp for learning will just simply move the sp to other skills he should've been invested in long ago. the other capsuleer, who invested none, will just have the same sp the way they are already setup. in fact, he will still have the same amount of sp as the other capsuleer. at the same time, both capsuleers will have the +12 bonuses given to them once the learning skills are removed.no one will have gained nor have lost sp in the process abd both stand to benefit from the new bonus that comes after the removal of learning skills."
11/30/2010,"sure, why not?"
11/30/2010,"tbh, even if it the store just had the skillbooks & implants, it would be an improvement as the lp would actually be useful.preferably though:nanofibresoverdrivesexpandersreinforced bulkheadsinterbus shuttle?containers?hull reppers?"

11/30/2010,"can we change the color of brackets, too. scanning towards the sun is brutal."
11/30/2010,"first of i want to say that incursions in concept are great, but unfortunately the way it has been implemented it will fail miserably and likely be more of a nuisance than an enjoyable game feature.first off since the incursions are broadcast to the world, the valuable low sec areas (where the mom bpcs get dropped) are just going to be continually camping in by the larger pirate alliances/corps. look at it this way.. new incursion starts today.. pirate corp looks it up and the corp starts camping the main entry areas for cheap thrills. new people trying out the feature die horribly.. and loose interest unlikely to try again. i could go on for pages on how this is gonna suck, but thats not my purpose.all of this work put into a great idea while leaving other stuff hanging. the fact that ccp has left past features to die is known to all so i wont focus there. so here are my thoughts on incursions done right and integrating it into existing game play.lets play off the factional warefare. the concept being once every month (or some other fixed or random time) the pirate faction of the winning side of the fw battle starts (loosing side makes manipulation way to easy)caldari vs gallente.. caldari are winning causing an incursion of guristas forces (using the current incursion mechanics or modified version of) these guristas forces would behave how the current sansha incursion would. these guristas would then drop guristas equivalent loot. at the same time amarr vs minmitar would run the same way. at any point the regions would be invaded by the pirate faction of the winning faction. with some careful thought 0.0 can be easily factored into this.the idea creates influx of faction mods/bpcs but only during the incursion. if guristas are invading for 6 months straight the value of these mods/bpcs would maybe drop a lot, however anyone that held onto serpentis version could make a killing since the availability would be minimal. want more sepentis mods? then start fighting for the right faction to allow. this could create a radically volatile market for faction items, but then again.. faction mods should not be so fixed in price.obviously i kept the idea here light as to not have a 10 page report, so please dont nit pick on how this could be manipulated and exploited.. geez, i know.. i just dont feel like writing out every details to prevent such responses.. my real point here is instead of letting potential good features like fw sit to rot, and introducing another potentially good feature in a not so good way.. use the good ideas and build on existing features. (hint to ccp: even if its all new, at least you give the image you are not letting your old stuff die out and youa re trying to revitalize it)"
11/30/2010,this would carry more weight if the expansion you were complaining about was actually live on tq.
11/30/2010,i admit my complaints of the upcoming expansion are speculative. however the concept/proposal is still valid. (which is really what this post is about)
11/30/2010,"no, it isn't valid, because you are just guessing. wait until an issue actually exists before complaining about it."
11/30/2010,"you obviously didn't understand the overall point of my post..while i started with a few negative projections, the main point of the post was about an idea to integrate incursions with fw to provide more options and revitalize and old feature that hasn't seen much love.but hey if you want to forum troll here rather than provide constructive feedback, have at it.. oh.. wait.. you already have."
11/30/2010,"that's why ccp wanted us all to come to sisi and test it out before deployment. they want feedback like yours to ensure the maximum amount enjoyment of incursion. even though the problem doesn't exist yet in tq, your argument is valid and ccp should look into this before the problem even begins.to borrow a euphymism from the healthcare industry... it's cheaper to prevent the illness than it is to fix it."
11/30/2010,"overviewincursion will bring to eve the new character creator (end of 2010).incarna will bring to eve full-body avatars (mid 2011).the full body avatars will be really boring if they use limited set of pre-baked animations.the new character creator is a very good example supporting my statement - currently it has stunning visuals, but lack of content - most of the modifiers are not working, very few options for clothes and accessoires. this will change, but it requires enormous resources.how to avoid pre-baked animations and hundreds of man-years for creating them?use novel middleware / tools available for the first timeikinema offers innovative & disrupting technology allowing real-time character animation, retargeting, balance etc.check this intro - these are not pre-baked animations, but programatically scripted actionspotential benefitsreallistic behavior and fluid movements of charactersreal-time alterations in characters' behavior due to external factors (alchohol, drugs, wounds etc.)very serious benefits for the art department - a magnitude better and faster release of content with the same resourcesdisclaimerthis is not spam, advertisment etc.i am not benefiting from ikinema promotion and/or sales.a company i have shares in utilizes ikinema technology for a future ps3 title."
11/30/2010,"what if we nerfed eccm, but added a ""minimum lockable targets"" number to it? so if you had one eccm module fitted, you could always at least lock one target, two fitted would let you lock two and so on?edit: supporting this proposal, or at least an iteration on it. i like 0->1, i just think it might be worth requiring an eccm to gain that advantage."
11/30/2010,"yeah, no. 'fraid i can't support this. giving caldari wtf pwn ewar skills far beyond other races' ewar abilities is not balanced in any sense of the word.having an ecm module reduce maxed locked targets to 1 means insta-primary the ecm ship, which it will already be anyway. as it stands now, there is a chance that the jam will fail, admittedly frigates stand almost no chance. but small ships should have weaker sensor strength anyway.i thought the idea to introduce a minimum locked targets for eccm interesting. but beefing up the sensor strength is the appropriate counter to an ecm attack.for those ""small gangs"" that have been wtfpwn'd by ecm in tha past, i hope the experience taught your fcs which targets are supposed to be primary. let me give you a hint: it ain't the dramiel."
11/30/2010,.
11/30/2010,"1) changing active targets from 0 to 1 will make ecm even more useless in big fights than they are now. that means primary targets will be shot at no matter what (and we all know that in big fleets there are multiple ""primary"" targets because 80% of the fleet is not listening to the fc).2) changing active targets from 0 to 1 will cripple ecm ships in small gangs. that means an interceptor will always have a point on an ecm ship. unlike rapier, for example, which can chew interceptors in a couple of volleys, falcons are far more vulnerable because they simply can't hit an interceptor and are as good as dead.3) falcons and scorpions are not shield tankers. if you ever flew one of them, you would at least know how to fit it.not supported."
11/30/2010,yes
11/30/2010,"not supported, please add that the jammed target can't target the jammer."
11/30/2010,"if it is unfair that a target can lose all locks...it is unfair that a target can be prevented from warping at up to 70+ km away.it is unfair that any frigate-sized and most cruiser-sized ships can have their cap instantly and completely drained by the click of a button from up to 60+ km away.it is unfair that any ship within 10 km loses 90+% of their speed almost instantly.honestly, the only reason people don't regularly complain about the uber recons from the other races is they rarely realize what hit them before they died, whereas the effects of the ecm boats are very obvious and usually not paired with getting called primary target."
11/30/2010,do it!
11/30/2010,"yes, because they fought to earn and keep it. completely fair mechanism. if you want to address the mechanisms that lead to their power (entry chokepoints, old skool pos spam, increased ease of logistics, etc) you might have something to address. but changing all the stuff now isn't going to remove the hold that they have. damage has already been done.you have a terribly flawed view of the economy. ok now you are getting just a wee bit too tinfoil hat.i agree that monolithic self-sustaining alliances are a crappy part of the game. but your misinformed ranting isn't the way of going about changing it."
11/30/2010,"i almost didn't want to take the time to respond to this due to the vast amount if incorrect info, but let me try to summarize.""sandbox"" = the idea of the sandbox in eve is to allow the players to drive the results. in any scenario you do this you will drive a few major power blocs, a few second and third tier power blocks and their pets. the idea to put in measures to stop this would in fact prevent the open ""sandbox"" results you are stating are not there.the 2 additional points i want to deflate for you are as follows1.) ""even besides all of aspects of the game created by player influence, there remains the countless changes by ccp to help these major alliances in their continued domination of every aspect of the game. recent improvements to 0.0 incomes for example, infrastructure improvements"" look, one of the main reasons for some of the dominion changes was in fact to try and accomplish the exact opposite. ccp changed game mechanics to make it extremely expensive to hold space and easier to take it over. in addition, they added even more costs for upgrades. do you realize that having a system with a jump bridge now costs 300 mil a month and cyno jammed system now costs 600 mil a month... each.. on top of regular sov bills and such. this on what used to be essentially free. their upgrades to plexes and other pve elements were to allow alliances to reduce space and support same number of people. if you don't know already.. a team of about 5-10 people (or less) could consume all of the ded complexes in an entire region in less than a day. in most cases these changes didn't impact 0.0 the way ccp intended, but the point is still valid that you are misunderstanding ccps intent.2.) only a few alliances dominate and no one else can play the 0.0 game (yes im paraphrasing)basically this is inaccurate also. if you .. as 1 person wanted to take over some 0.0 space.. you can.. not easily.. but then again, those that have the space didn't get it easily. you either: a.) form an alliance, build it up good and strong, prove its worth and get taken in as an ally.. build up stronger until you are independent.. or b.). work your ass off as a renter. 0.0 is obviously a lot more dynamic that you know. here are a list of just a few space holding 0.0 alliances that have come and goneroadkillsmashdmciacka tettriumvirateirontcfnot to mention the recent issues around bob/kenzoku/it alliance and most recently goonswarm. ."
11/30/2010,"actually, no, it isn't. what is the problem?"
11/30/2010,"you are given a choice with wormhole systems. yes, you can own your ""gold mine"" space even with just a couple of friends. besides, w-space is far more profitable for individual players than nullsec. individual players don't get a single isk from moon mining, while in w-space, you share everything.fight between large alliances is a whole new dimension of this game. you can choose to participate in it by joining (or forming) a large alliance, or you can choose not to participate in it. every choice has its pros and cons. decide for yourself and choose how you would like to play.p.s.you would be surprised what good organisational skills, a couple of fleet commanders, just a little isk and a lot of diplomacy can create. try it for yourself before crying on the forum about it."
11/30/2010,"that is good point. basically what you need to be the new powerhouse of eve is good leadership skills (real life one, not the ingame thingies) and few good fc's and damn big pile of dedication for the dream of power. good chunk of isk will help, but is not essential in my opinion. just would take a bit longer at first to get the avalanche moving. there is downside of this though. if alliance leader will have to leave it can make the whole thing crumble horribly fast. the good alliance leader is sort of like a 'soul' of entity - without it it's just a shell, a pile of meat for the grinder. and the good fc's are your flags and banners, rise them and and pilots rally around them to shed their share of blood even against odds that do not look good at first glance."
11/30/2010,evil zionist cabal...in space
11/30/2010,shut up and pay your rent!
11/30/2010,"while we're ending the tyranny of 0.0 alliances, we should also end the tyranny of pirates hitting helpless low sec miners and mission runners, mercs camping helpless haulers in jita, suicide gankers tormenting helpless targets of opportunity in empire, scammers victimizing the ""it's too good to be true, so i'd better jump on it"" crowd, wormhole corps hoarding wormhole loot, t2 bpo owners killing the margins of helpless inventor/builders.... and so on."
11/30/2010,more thumbs up yeah!
11/30/2010,"this topic pops up a lot, and rightly so - but iirc ccp said theyll do it as soon as they can without a huge performance decrease."
11/30/2010,"it seems like every other thread these days is complaining about the overpoweredness of traditional ecm but i haven't seen much in the way of viable alternatives. my inspiration came from the amarr ewar tactic of tracking disruptors - why not have an ewar mechanic that affects rate of fire?a mechanic like this would make a big difference to fleet fights - that nightmare or zealot might be pumping out some hefty volley damage at the moment but with a considerably lower rate of fire, it indirectly strengthens your fleets shield and armour regeneration. the good thing with an ewar such as this is that it isn't based on probability like current ecm and still gives opponents a chance of fighting back, albeit less effectively.it would be able to affect not just turrets but launchers as well, if it was based on a percentage reduction. i'm not enough of a mathematian or eft warrior to say what would be a reasonable rof reduction but i do feel that there is some potential in this idea. what do you folks think?"
11/30/2010,"somebody suggested i post this here so i've gone ahead and done it.a lot of the command ships are styled (weapons usage, and tank style) on the tier 2 battle cruisers more than their tech1 tier 1 brethren.such as this.i think this makes sense rp wise, and gives a lot of people a chance to see their favourite tier2 bc all pimped out how they like.their may be a slight balance issue with the gallente since theirs are the wrong way around, but they could probably balance this out by switching a few industrial stats around, or could maybe just go with the flow (not all races have to be the same everywhere).ps - this doesn't spoil any possibilty of another tech2 bc class, there's plenty of other ships that are used in more then 2 rolls (t1 with multiple t2 variants (see hictors))."
11/30/2010,"not supported, it has to be consistency between the t1 tier1/tier2 hulls and the fleet/field commands. can't just have them picked randomly. just imagine if the vargur used the typhoon hull and the panther used the tempest hull. people would laugh at ccp."

11/30/2010,i think you had a bad day?
11/30/2010,"i've heard that ccp plans on opening the keyboard up to more shortcuts, i propose that the a,s,d and w buttons be used to designate orbit direction when pressed, around whatever object in space is currently selected.this would drastically improve the quality of space combat as you can now choose to orbit a ship and not fly directly into the middle of a blob of ships nearby if you did not intend to orbit in that direction.orbit could be confirmed when releasing the button so that use of multiple buttons would produce diagonal results.a for left orbit, w for orbit over the top, use a and w together for an orbital in the left and up direction. a transparent orbit path could be displayed over the selected object giving the pilot a visual. if checking for diagonal orbits, and the pilot decides to go back to a single direction (non diagonal) orbit, the release of one of the asdw buttons should change the orbit back within .5 seconds to avoid the mistake of someone wanting to chose a diagonal but not releasing the two keys at exactly the same time (is that clear? anyone wanna word that better?)orbit command would not send if any of the asdw buttons are still pressed, and will send command relating to whichever directional button(s) were still held within the last 0.5 seconds of the last asdw button being released.using 0.5 seconds arbitrarily here, 0.25 seconds or some other time may be usable, i suspect 0.25 would be better than 0.5 but it's just an example.direction would be based on the players camera drone direction of view with respect to selected object, so that straight over orbit is always straight and above the object with respect to the camera angle, allowing for more control of the orbits, and you can chose to focus your camera on the selected object for ease of orbit direction choice.complicated in text as it may appear, i believe ccp is certainly capable of this and it would give flying a much more involved and personal feel."
