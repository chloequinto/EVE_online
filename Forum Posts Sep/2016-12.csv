well that is a decidedly difficult dilemma and i have yet to see a game do anything about it to actually reach a balance, there are notable examples we can examine in eve and elite for the sake of discussion but in the end only genuine effort from the developer would make anything happen and that is not something i see ccp caring about, the game has barely changed in time i have left after all. still if this continues and nothing is done about it the pot will keep bubbling and the game will keep bleeding population till it dies while the people at the wheel sit on their hands and pretend their vision is the true vision, then again its something i would expect from people who are so poor at adapting to the changing market.lets get on with it then. both eve and elite have a problem, as i discussed earlier it is a root issue common to that environment and its that the games are designed for people who get their kicks from forcing others into interactions they don't want and or can't possibly succeed at while pumping their chest and yelling how good they for having won a rigged contest in which only they as the aggressor had any hope of winning. both games allow a hostile party to engage a target without their consent and allow them in most cases to manipulate the battlefield in such a way that any though of fair combat is out of the window. in both games the risk to loss ratio is entirely arbitrary, you get into a tiny ship and you can feck the best of them if you bring enough buddies."
12/4/2016,"the similarities end between them there as both titles approach this issue from either side of the extremes surrounding a proper solution. ccp takes the complete hands off approach and is attempting to inject more violence into the game to keep their core audience while opening it up as ""free to play"" as an excuse to draw in a crowd veteran players can prey on. while fdev takes the other extreme, putting the power to have pvp interactions completely into the hands of the players, allowing them to play in small private splinters or to enjoy the game world in a completely solo experience. ccps' approach is a glorified slaughterhouse for new players, retention is not a thing that they are going to get from it, its a really disgusting ploy. fdevs' game feels dead and for all intents and purposes is pretty much so. so if change is on the menu a system needs to exist between these two extremes. a system where like in society if you act like a monster you will be treated as one and if that is not a fact you can accept you are one of two things, delusional and or a coward.whether this kind of approach in dealing with various play styles is losing this game players shouldn't be a serious topic of discussion, it is, its a simple trend to observe from this environment and many others like it. it leads to a slow, agonizing death of the ip which it affects and the only cure is being honest with yourselves and accepting that if you truly want pvp the other person should not be defenseless while you are wilding a fecking rocket launcher aiming at the them from a bunker you are huddled in while they are holding a big ""kill me"" sign.when you manage to get over this laughable, juvenile attempt at holding onto a safe space where you can be asshats to random strangers trying to enjoy the same world you populate, the discussion on how to fix this can begin."
12/4/2016,"i do not understand the arbitrary limitations on drone use that is currently in place on alpha accounts. i can respect that fighters and sentries should be limited to omega accounts since their operation is usually tied to much heavier vessels that are unavailable to alpha players, same logic applying to tier 2 drone variants but for reasons that tier 2 tech is unavailable to alphas. however, all other drone types have module counterparts that are available to an alpha user. the fact that one has to have all the prerequisites in order to even use those drone types makes them inherently more prohibitive than their module counterparts. lets also not forget that at the current highest tier of combat drones the damage type that is usually most effective in combat is simply not available. this leaves me, a player who wants to enjoy the play style of drones with pretty much nothing to do. worse yet since i am playing gallente i feel forced into getting a sub because unlike other factions who have mainly their ship technology gated behind omega status i have most of the flavor that makes my faction unique being locked behind a paywall.so in conclusion i would like to petition that drone types of the utility (mining, salvage, e-warfare, logistics) variety and heavy scout drones are added to the alpha experience. i leave the way these drones are made available up to you of course for balance reasons."
12/4/2016,"i came back just to check things out because of alpha clones... i quit playing about a year ago. after playing the grind game to make isk i had managed to turn a couple hundred thousand into about 3 billion in less than two months. but... it was a serious grind. i don't know how many hours, probablywell over a hundred just to grind out that isk.i think the conflicting thing about this game is just that everything is tied to isk. you really can't do much of anything without it. that's why i just can't wrap my head around playing this game much. i'd say my logic probably follows along with a lot of people and it doesn't really matter if you have the money to pay to play or not.i want to play eve and i don't have the money to pay for a sub.- let me spend hours grinding out isk to pay for a sub...- i still need isk to do the fun things i want to do.... but i just spent my isk for a plex...- crap... lets grind some more to get isk for the actual fun i want to have.- eve online turns into job... - i quit...that is the situation i played through when i tried to play without paying a sub.... even though i could (and did for those couple months, even an extra for an alt account one month).now, even considering coming back and paying again, my logic goes something like this...i want to play eve and i do have the money to pay for a sub! yay!- well i have paid for my sub, but again i still need isk to blow up space pirates and have fun.- i can spend some time farming isk to have fun, or i can buy another plex.- i can afford it, just an hour at my actual job can afford me a sub plex and a plex for fun! saves me countless hours grinding....- buys 2 plexes...- why am i paying $30 a month to play a game again? i can go play guild wars 2 or any number of games that are just as much fun without the reliance on in game or real life money.- realizes other games are just as much fun without being $30 or even $15 a month....- does not compute...- end subi think currently alpha clones do have too many limitations. they shouldn't be able to do everything, but they should be able to do a lot.the real underlying problem is there isn't really enough fun to be had without constantly worrying about isk. also, since you are capable of losing a lot of isk just by simply playing the game or making mistakes that makes the point even more sharp. maybe change up the structure of the economy a little by having npcs offer a wider variety of ships and mods for purchase very cheaply so there is a broader range of things that can be done without sinking in tons of isk. let the whales have access to cap ships, personal stations and top of the line modules and such with their abundance of isk and/or money if they want to spend it on the game.when people come to play the game, they don't want to just fly frigates around all the time. they want to be able to have their battleships too but may not ever be able to get them or continue losing them stupidly resulting in them just quitting because they can't afford to replace them. maybe instead of just getting game time with a plex you could get npc currency that could only be used to purchase those cheap ships and mods i mentioned. make them non transferable if you want. this would allow people to still pay for a sub but then also have access to things that make the game fun. slightly better versions of the ships could be available as usual with isk and just have a moderate advantage over the npc varieties. so there would still be incentive for people that want to spend the money to acquire isk and these other ships.just my opinion. i did enjoy the game for a time... but if it just ends up turning into a second job for farming isk... people won't tend to enjoy it for long."
12/4/2016,"i would call it an ""i want to play eve"" disorder. anybody who has played this game for some time has contacts and activities spread through all the cluster. if i want to play with x group of people in the morning, that prevents me from playing with y group of people until 20 hours later. you simply end up apologizing and not playing with one of the two groups. that's damaging to the game and the community."

12/5/2016,"oh why don't you just bugger off again? your attempt to extrapolate from a game to rl behavior is old and tiresome and stupid beyond belief. perhaps if you weren't so bad at the game and life in general you'd have a better outlook (hey, if you can extrapolate to real life so can the rest of us).seriously, what happened? were you mining and afk when somebody warped in a flew over to your badly fit retriever and blow it to bits or did you overload your freighter and die to a gank group because you were foolish?and lets not mention the one bit of evidence that shows when a player is killed illegally in their first 15 days they stay longer than those killed legally and even longer that those who are not killed in their first 15 days at all.whiners like you should literally leave. you do not get the game. at all. this is a pvp game and in this game i can shoot you in the face if i am willing to accept the consequences...which means i can shoot you in hs, ls, ns or a wormhole."
12/5/2016,"i've never been ganked in my entire time playing. neither have i ever lost a transport with valuable cargo. you probably stopped reading after the first two sentences of my post and decided to vomit up this idiocy you call a response. bravo gent, thank for proving everything i said about people like you true in the most cringe worthy display you could manage. don't worry, i won't be staying long and neither will most people who try this relic of a game. keep pumping your chest and crying about how now one understands the game better than you. after all, i've never met a pvper who is intelligent enough to have a shred of self reflection.p.s. its delicious how clueless you are."
12/5/2016,"proving what? you know, literally, nothing about me. you have assumed that because i oppose your views i must be some sort of degenerate irl, but you know nothing. you do not know that yesterday i and my family wept as we had to put one of our dogs down that we have cared for since she was a puppy (11 years). a dog that developed bone cancer. a disease that she fought long and hard and that we helped her fight, but in the end a disease we could not beat. yet because i have, on occasion ganked the odd miner here and there and participated in various burn jita/amarr events, i am somehow a bad person irl? seriously, how about you just uninstall the game and leave because it is you who are the true cancer in the game. your sanctimonious bravo sierra sickens and disgusts me.do you want to know why i don't have an issue with code. or other freighter ganking organizations...because the freighter pilot has the power to greatly reduce his likely hood of being ganked. being ganked is pretty much a mathematical formula. keep the value of your cargo below the given threshold and you will be far less attractive a target for ganking. if it is going to cost 400 million isk to gank you, then do not put over 800 million in cargo in your freighter. if it is small enough in volume, use a blockade runner which is nearly ungankable in hs. using a scout will solve most ganking problems. using a jf will also eliminate ganking issues. instead we get players who put 6 billion isk worth of cargo in their freighter then are upset when they are ganked. the reaction should not be, ""oh that is terrible!"" but, ""well geez what did you expect with 6 billion isk worth of cargo?""as for miner ganking, of the limited solo miner ganking i have done i have meet some...surprising results. one guy was totally cool with being ganked by another player. i found that so refreshing i sent him the isk value of his loss and an email encouraging him to stay in game and even consider trying pvp. another got away from my gank attempt and we had a nice convo where he talked about how he liked that kind of challenge.my point here is that ganking other players, even new ones, does not have to turn out lie you might logically think it does. in fact ccp's own analysis suggests quite the opposite. on a broader scale what it suggests is that when other players interact with other players it promotes player retention. meeting new people, making new friends, and having new experiences...that will help game retention the most. changing the game so that players can remain isolated to a greater degree will not help at all. so forcing interactions...that is good for the game because it is that interaction that keeps people engaged. that you don't get that means you are part of the problem not the solution."
12/5/2016,"after reading those two long posts i am still not sure what your point is. is it that you do not like unbalanced pvp? or is it you do not like the people that play eve online?whether you meant to do it or not, you zeroed in on the reason why ccp has built the game the way they have. new eden is a open, full-time pvp sandbox where players are always free to interact with each other and through this competition and cooperation, create emergence. this player-driven construct, the integrated economy, is the true magic of the game which gives meaning to pve activites, value to things that you build, and the risk of loss makes things that much more engaging. almost every other game, like elite dangerous for example, feels lifeless and contrived, and will always do so as long as players have the choice to opt-out of the competition. it isn't really a competitive game at this point, just a bunch of players grinding worthless things for the sake of watching a number get ever larger. the non-consensual nature of eve online's competition is the core idea of the game. we are all competing for resources and power in a shared universe, a universe that feels alive and has purpose. if you remove that non-consensual pvp, the essence of eve's ""living work of science fiction"" would be lost, and it wouldn't keep bring players like you back or keeping them. it is that real loss that gives value to so many people who play just to build and gather things, and they would be the first to leave if you removed non-consensual pvp as soon as they realize that no-one wants to buy their stuff (or pay their subscription via plex) anymore given nothing meaningful would ever be lost. but more directly to your point, how do you expect ccp to balance such an open-world pvp zone? there is no way for ccp to prevent a solo player from loading up their industrial ship with everything they own and autopiloting it to the capital of {insert the name of large nullsec group here} and getting destroyed and bankrupted. player agency is paramount in a game like this and who your friends are, and how many you have, more important than almost anything else in determine your success in the sandbox. that said, ccp has made highsec extremely safe to support smaller groups, not to mention extremely lucrative, so it is perfectly possible to play the game without sticking your neck out and being a target for the largest groups in the game. yes, there are some activities, like deploying a structure or taking sov, which put you out there as content, but that is how risk vs. reward should work. players should be encouraged to offer themselves up as content for a greater reward, or no one will have the motivation to play the defender in a game that so prominently features permanent loss. eve online is not perfect. there are in fact many flaws in the design of the game and things that could be improved. however, the core idea that you are never safe anywhere, and if you put yourself in the sights of a large and powerful group you are fair game, is not one of them. that is a feature as they say. that may make eve online not the game for you. in that case, you can go back to the elite dangerous forums and complain there that that game should be more like eve online. but if you have an actual, concrete idea of how to make eve online better achieve its goal of being a player-driven, competitive pvp sandbox, or retain more new players, i am sure we would all be happy to consider them."
12/5/2016,"actually i can infer a lot about you from how you carry yourself in a conversation, you know its a thing some humans are good at, and let me tell you, you make a terrible impression. if you want to pull the bullshit card of you don't act like you do when you are talking from behind the anonymity of the internet then be my guest but then you are being an ******* here consciously and with intent.what i originally posted was a pretty in depth dissection of the root issue that is causing this game and others like it to lose players. i did not talk about strategies, or equating the game to real life or in fact any of the things you write in your posts. you are clueless and the only way you could have gotten offended as much as you have is if what i said cut pretty deep in how true it was about you.i am sorry for your loss of the pet, its a terrible thing to lose something you love. i do not, however, in any way in fact, understand how this is supposed to illustrate to me anything about who you are. going through a traumatic experience, although in this case lets face it its not the end of your world, does not make you a good person or a bad person. i fail to see how this anything to do with anything we are talking about.you are also a hypocrite given how you opened up the discussion with me by leveling personal insults and putting in question my ability to interact with the game while knowing nothing about me. only to huff and puff at me moments later when i said things about you from observing how you act instead of flinging **** at a wall and seeing what sticks.you also don't have either the attention span or the processing power necessary to interpret what i actually said, you are giving it the best meaning you can in your limited understanding of it and i can't blame you much for it, but i can still blame you.you are using the same tired excuses i heard from people across countless games protecting their precious safe one sided pvp space. you are a coward, you are ignorant and for all intents and purposes a poster child for the cancer that slowly kills interactive spaces that have great potential.given you are a little slow i put some of the more important things in bigger letters for you, i hope it helps, do try to read everything this time because otherwise you'll keep making an ass of yourself."
12/5/2016,"let me begin by thanking you for reading and understanding, that seems to be in short supply.to address you first question, i do not like unbalanced pvp and that leads me to not like the core player base for which eve online is designed for, the very core player base that remains no matter how many people leave. this issue is near and dear to my heart because for years i have watched what people who have that kind of mindset do to games, not pvp games of course but ones that have a pvp and pve component that share the same space. i figure its only fair i give insight into why this drives me, but i will save it for a paragraph at the end because i feel its merely tangential to the discussion at hand.i want you to understand that i am for pvp, i do not in any way shape or form hate it or want to limit its presence in the world of eve online or any other game where it is present. unfortunately from my extensive experience the only place where pvp genuinely thrives without inherently killing the game is in pure pvp experiences, elementary i know. every implementation of it in games that have a pve component seems to follow a terrible trend that leaves the combat one sided for a plethora of reasons. that being said, the fact the interactions in eve are non-consensual or that there is risk involved are not the problems. these criteria must be present as you have very rightly observed to give life to the game, to make it feel like the actions you take matter. without it a game like elite feels artificial and the actions you take in the might as well amount to playing cookie clicker. so what i am arguing for is not the removal of pvp or risk but a fundamental rethinking of their implementation that deviates from a decade old standard that has been so deeply entrenched in game design. i am also arguing for an genuine embrace of the notion that the problem actually exists because it does, its very real and it destroys games. i do this because after reading this thread i find most of its discussion still wrapped in complete denial of this fact, too mired in throwing back hypothetical extreme scenarios of how one can survive in this broken system if they play their cards just right.i will continue in my next post."
12/5/2016,"continued @ black pedroi have seen the sentiment that ""we are in trouble and i know problems exist, but its hard ok?"" use by a lot of people. i want you to understand that i hold no illusions about how difficult this task is and anyone who approaches it in any sort of meaningful discussion needs to realize this as well. however, that mindset is simply not good enough. the players having good ideas on how to fix these issues is also simply not good enough. this situation is way past ""we are in deep ****!"" and it requires an open and honest effort between players and devs to keep a place they love to be in and create in alive. well lets face it, i am using the wrong term, no matter what happens eve is going to live on for quite a while, it has a strong enough following to do so. what i am trying to motivate people to do is to fight against it becoming a mere shadow of its former self which is really what is happening to it right now.the people who pvp are one part of an equation that makes as you've put it ""eve a living work of science fiction"", the other being people who want to play in pve scenarios. when you empower the people in only one part of that equation you effectively dehumanize the others since they are at least in this game very inherently linked. as you've put it people become ""content"" for others to enjoy, this is an unacceptable frame of mind. no one in their right mind will want to participate in an environment where their existence serves a purpose as a product for someone else to consume. this is only made more acutely present by the horrendous implementation of f2p into the eve universe, a topic so poorly handled it is a discussion for another thread. the way current pvp mentality goes it is the victim who is already powerless to do anything that is making the mistake of presenting themselves as a target. that is also how **** culture views the victim, a jarring comparison perhaps but one that needs to be made. people often think that just because they are emulating a behavior in a harmless medium it is ok for them to do it, it is not and it needs to change. can you argue in return that bad things happen to good people and that its just part of simulating a gritty experience in this unique world trying to emulate the struggles we face in our own, sure. however, you need to consider that this is a game and most people in it need to have fun, not just one group. there is lack of balance and you fix that lack of balance not by taking things away from people who already have them (the pvpers) but by giving more agency to those who do not. no matter what argument is made in a vacuum the current state of the game leaves those who do not choose the path of pvp helpless. give them means to defend themselves, force people who want to make a profit to really have to work for it if they want to pry it from the hands of others. if they are genuinely after the thrill of battle this should be a welcome change, it will make the fights more intense and the rewards that much more satisfying without leaving people on the other side with the feeling like the could not do anything. i know it is here that someone will jump in start spouting how this and that way of doing things will keep you alive, that is not a way to do it. planning is passive, both sides do it but only one side has the agency to do something when an encounter takes place. not only that but all those ridiculous things people describe doing are meant for people who have already fully integrated themselves into the game and in those cases the margin for error is slim. they also say that just not enjoying the pve play style to its full effect is a valid way to stay alive, then when an argument like that is made why in the world does the other side get to do what they want? in either case most people will never make it to the stage where the current excuses for the broken system even work, there is no point in even discussing them.so in the end i don't really have anything specific to tell you about how to fix the game as it is now, i'd be happy to go theory craft in a thread that isn't this if people want to do that but i view this place as one where awareness of these issues first needs to be cultivated. as promised here is why i take the effort to have an open, lengthy conversation with anyone civil and willing to have it on this topic:i have been playing lots of games for well over a decade of my life, in that time i have delved into many wondrous worlds, fought lots of skilled people in various tests of will and reflexes, i have traveled far and wide as one would put it. i do not limit myself to a given genre of game and i do not try to impose the play styles i like onto others. however, in all of that time i have seen a particular breed of person plague the game industry like a cancer. the dedicated pvper. they are like locusts, swarming across the gaming landscape. they will enter the space enjoyed by other people who may not directly have the same mindset as them or for that matter be at all interested in doing what they are doing and aggressively convert that space to suit their desires. they will lobby, scream, beg, spam, threaten and do everything in their power to bring their one true hobby, pvp, into a place which may not in any way support such an activity. they drain resources from other development priorities and usually push out a larger portion of the population with their thrill seeking. it is a thrill they are after though, not actual challenge, dear me, those people are some of the most spineless worms i have met in my life. after all of that the game usually struggles, sometimes it withers, sometimes it outright dies, but these people then just move on to the next space they decide to invade."
12/5/2016,"i'd like to point out that as a product of tiericide much of the utility of many t1 hulls rests in ""utility drone bays"" capable of fielding less than a full flight, which can't be well utilized by alphas due to the limitations on which drones they can use."
12/5/2016,"hello capsuleers,i returned to eve after 2 years. i did mainly pvp before but also ratting and misisons to earn some isk.to get into the game again i started with mission in ""new babylon"" called osmon.summary after 1-2 month:- 2x highsec ganked noctis at mission spot- 1x machariel ganked on missions spot and came away with have hull- 1x hauler ganked at gate also came away with hull damage- 5x visitors in missions trying to lure you into a fault and stealing loot- miners getting killed in highsec on a daily basisi play since 2004 and i cannot remember seeing so much crime in highsec before. to get it straight i love pvp and piracy and i think we have enough chances for pvp in eve. we can have wars, go low-sec and 0.0 and wormhole-space. why do we need this highsec ganking ?yes eve is a game but its also very close to realife. eve is pain and thrill but we should make sure that those people that like to be productive and bring eve forward have a place in this game too. also we should make sure that players can actually use their expensive ships and items rather than spinning them in station because they fear to loose it in highsec. it doesnt make sense to me. are we a society that support crime in the first place ? shouldnt we make sure that we have a balance between good and bad ? i see no balance at all here.lets say i have a very valueable car in reallife and i life in a country and city that has a working police. can i drive it around ? yes i can. because the government and the executive works. here in eve the executive and the government doesnt work anymore. everybody that carries a few million isk is a potential victim and the criminals have nothing to fear.why do we actively support this behaviour rather than protecting our citizen in highsec space ?again i am aware of the fact that eve is pain and thats good but i honestly think we should make sure that there is a place for everybody in eve. also for those that dont want to pvp and just mine in freedom. btw from what i heard from a few players that quit is that they quit because they are not willing to invest time in a game anymore where producers, miners and traders are cannon-fodder. its simply to real to spend so much time for being killed by those that only seek fun in destroying ppl that cannot defend themself. i vote for proper punishment for crimes in highsec. it must hurt. in reallife ppl would be kept away for ages or decades and there is no clone soldier tag helping a criminal in reallife.looking at the players numbers i see roughly a 50% drop in players numbers over the years. to some extend i think this is also related to the unbalanced highsec-crime.we need crime and we need pain but we also need a more secure highsec and most important of all i think we shouldnt be seen in the world as a bunch of idiots that only get fun in killing innocent unprotected people. humans should be friendly and helpful and not just seeking isk and joy in killing easy targets. we teach our players that being a criminal has no downside and is lucrative. teach them that crime will be punished. if you dont you will only get the ****** players and the good will quit for another game.imho eve-highsec looks to me like a place for poor minded ppl that have no balls for real pvp and just do the easy-killing of players that cannot defend themself. and i see the police is not working. i can totally understand when players say i dont feel save anymore in eve and quit.i feel sad the way eve looks these days and i honestly hope it will change anytime soon. i see also similarities to gta5 online where the poor minded ppl kill the same person a 100 times in row and have fun doing it. pointless. cheers michael ps: i would be more than happy if we could leave the smack talk out and that peoples opinions get tolerated."
12/5/2016,"hello there.i am returning player to eve online.since the eula is changed meanwhile i was on break from eve, i cant use isboxer anymore due to input broadcasting is considered as input automation (its half true half not).eve have a lot of tools. so is there a possibility that eve online might have its own program for players with more than 1 account.that gives eve admins total control ower the programm . what it is and what you can do.or the second idea i have. there nmight be a module for linking ships together. high.med or low slot module then.that each chip you have must have that cpecific module fitted and they are linked. like in fleet works1 dude broadcasts target and all fleet will shoot it :p."
12/5/2016,hey great and might csm.i was just wondering if one of you would consider looking into the issue of blueprint copies and some improvements that have been discussed in the following thread.
12/5/2016,yes please do talk about this within the csm and let us know what you think.this will fix an issue for us builders that ahve to put on hundreds of new jobs every few hours with craplods of alts.also our inventories will hopefully lag less and the organizing of blueprint will become bareable.
12/5/2016,"the biggest problem i can see with allowing bpcs to be combined, is that the number of runs is a limiting factor in how long a job can run for. being able to run a longer job makes it easier to build some things. and they're already easy enough that it'll saturate any market for it. so those things will only periodically be profitable, unless you're using a bpo."
12/5/2016,"since it was my idea i guess i'll chime in.we went over that in the thread as well, and basically the cons here mostly seem like edge cases, or questionable situation like drone bpcs where the the batch is so small me doesn't actually do anything.what people mostly agreed on was that its desirable qol, but there was some disagreement as to how much, if any, opportunity cost should be attached to balance it out.what we don't have information on is how much of an intentional limiting factor things like ""lost run time"" due to player efficiency or ""lost me value"" due to simple math applied to cheaper jobs, and how much of it is just a product of the scale of eve industry from ccp's perspective. like, is this an intentional part of production balance meant to incentivize people to slavishly log in and manage jobs for production advantage, or is the primary design goal for production one of raw resource/time/job slot efficiency alone.where ccp sits on the question of these two issues is unclear, given the design changes to invention in crius (and indeed the removal of the 24h skill que, upwell structure vuln mechanics etc.) it seems ccp has been trending away from mechanics that prioritize logging in more as opposed to managing systems effectively by scheduling less frequent logins intelligently.so bringing it up at some point if you could would be fantastic to see if ""balance by login frequency"" and ""useless me"" are actually intentional, as that's going to inform where this sort of thing sits in the scale from ""qol"" to ""isk sink"" and honestly we don't have ccps ear to figure out what's what."
12/5/2016,"but alpha clones do do a lot. can you give examples of what an alpha should be able to do, but currently cannot?"
12/5/2016,"the main restrictions come in the form of skill training caps that limit what you can do and/or use. you can only fly about 1/3 of the ships, and actually less than that when you take into consideration faction limitations. for example, one of my characters i started as gallente but fly a lot of amarr ships. can't use any of those now if i log back on as alpha since they are the wrong faction. skill cutoffs make using most of the modules i was using impossible to use. i just read another post specifically talking about someone that had started gallente but quickly realized that hardly any of the much needed drone skills were trainable, which is supposed to be one of gallentes strong points.before i quit last time one of the easy things i did to make some extra isk on another account while i was doing something on my main, was just going to defend fw sites in a little punisher stacked full of warp core stabs. could just sit at a station and farm lp while actively paying attention to my other account. not only can that toon not fly the punisher anymore, she cant use wcs either. was fun to just do that and not pay attention until you heard the targeting beeps then just align and laugh while you warp out even after they try and scramble you. my hauler doesn't even have access to his charon anymore. you can't do hardly anything effectively in industry, trade and all sorts of areas because of the harsh training limits. as i said, if they want to limit anything, it should just be maybe cutting off access to the very highest skills and cap ships. just the 2x training time is enough of an incentive to get people to sub if they like the game and want to continue to a more advanced level.my quote from another post:i think the main tl:dr here is just that not many people want the ""pay to grind"" experience anymore. if they pay they want to be able to do whatever with the game without worrying about grinding on top of a sub. vice versa some people just want something to play for free for whatever reason and don't mind grinding. there are lots of bad f2p models out there, but there are also a lot of good ones."
12/5/2016,"to me, what is more damaging is the notion that you can be flying with goons in the morning, with pl in the afternoon and with co2 in the evening. where is your true loyalty?"
12/5/2016,if you read the whole thread you'll understand i'm not talking about anything remotely similar to that.

12/6/2016,"first, it is not me, but ccp, who describes their game as a ""living work of science fiction"". it is clear they view their game as an attempt to build a living, evolving virtual universe where the players generate the content, and thus by definition be the content. eve online is not a set of toys where participants just build stuff up like a minecraft server or elite dangerous, but is a emergent and interactive world simulating human interaction and designed from the ground up to foster competition. put another way, eve is not a game where the goal to collect a bunch of stuff build a space station and some ships to fly around it and gaze upon its magnificence. no, eve is a game where the goal is to collect a bunch of stuff in competition with other players and build some ships to defend it from the other players who want to destroy it or take it for themselves. build your dream, wreck their dreams indeed. i think this might be the root of your problem: players are the primary content of this game. offering yourself up to the other players is part of the social contract of being part of the eve universe. if you find that ""unacceptable"" you are never going to fully be comfortable with this game. i don't see anything radical with this idea like you seem to however. many-fold more people play games like starcraft, call of duty, or league of legends where they are the primary content to be consumed by the other side. there is nothing inherently abhorrent about this ""frame of mind"", it is just a matter of setting expectations. eve online is just an extension of this. it's like a giant, persistent, and infinitely more complex game of starcraft where players come and go from the game universe gathering, building and fighting for dominance. i get that might not be what some people are looking for, but i don't see how you can declare that ""no one in their right mind will want to participate"" given how many millions of people routinely play pvp games, and how many hundreds of thousands currently subscribe to eve as they have for almost 14 years. it isn't an unacceptable ""frame of mind"". the game just isn't compatible with your frame of mind."
12/6/2016,"although you have some good points i think we have run up against a wall in our discussion. its an issue i noticed with your posts when you originally responded to me, i figured you simply did not understand what i meant so i went into much greater detail to hopefully clarify that. the core issue that i have with your argument and is the thing i have been discussing revolves around the very core of the dynamic experiences of eve.that of the interaction is never fair.every example you have brought up in your post is an inherently pvp designed space, people enter the social contract you speak of when they enter it because it is quite plain with what interaction you can expect. not only that but each of those spaces are designed to give both interacting parties in those settings the same level of agency. skill and decision making decides the victor in those environments, that is not the case with eve. the risk to reward ratio is also the same for both parties in all of those games, which it is not in eve.the way eve handles the integration of pvp with pve is outdated. very outdated. it has thrived because it has largely gone unchallenged in the market due to having little to no competition from titles of the same genre for a long time. that is not the case anymore. in the time that eve rode on without change on the gravy train of subscription straight into obsolescence the rest of the market evolved. there is a good reason no current commercially successful title handles player interaction like eve does, it objectively does not work. in the current market pvp and pve experiences are completely separate from each other because people do not want to put in the effort to properly integrate them together. its hard, leads to the issues being discussed here and is generally not worth the effort.what eve is doing now with their alpha system is a joke as well, its the earliest iteration of the f2p model that has been proven to fail every time it is used, the internet is littered with bad memories of games that died using this model. its a desperate attempt to preserve the status quo they and you are used to. however, you do not succeed buy forcing people into subscribing by taking things away from them, you succeed by providing complete experiences people want to pay for, if blizzard can do it and ggg can do it then its pretty fecking obvious the model works. the bottom line is simple, the current gaming market does not support predatory gaming experiences like eve.it (eve) also no longer has anywhere near the amount of content to justify a subscription system in the first place. most completely free to play games can easily compete for its audience now. these are not my opinions, these are observations anyone who takes the time to look can make. in closing, you are completely right, the game is completely not compatible with my frame of mind because i live in the now and not in a world of decade old outdated values and standards."
12/6/2016,"perhaps we have hit a bit of a wall. no, i understand your point i just don't see that there is any evidence to support it. there are plenty of pure pvp games out there, many of them not especially balanced. if you look at you the top steam games for instance, there is ark, rust, and path of exile which prominently feature non-balanced, predatory pvp, where many of the others lack a pvp matching system meaning you can often end up facing off against someone who completely outclasses you, especially when you are starting out. in fact all of the top 10 are pvp games (although i guess you can argue gtav and maybe civ 5 are mostly played in pve modes).i am pretty sure the market can support such types of games with ""unfair"" pvp in 2016, despite what you claim. that doesn't mean there aren't things that can be done to make the pvp eve online more balanced, dynamic and engaging, and help new players get into it, but i think your premise that somehow eve is a dinosaur that is out of step with the current game market and thus no one wants to play is just wrong. in any case, even if you were right and people's taste for pvp has shifted in the last decade or so, i don't see ccp meaningfully changing how eve online works this far into the product's life-cycle. it was conceived as a full-time pvp sandbox, and it will be such until the day the servers are switched off. the risk of alienating the current players who are invested in the game and enjoy this type of game play is too great. i think there is a better chance of ccp releasing other games in the eve universe, like eve: valkyrie, that feature more balanced pvp game play to go after the players you say are out there but are not served by their current product.anyways, i look forward to seeing some of your specific ideas to make eve's pvp more engaging for both sides in the appropriate forum."
12/6/2016,"i'm late to the party here, but i have a question for those supporting ganking.i don't have an issue with ganking in general, but do you seriously think that it isn't laughably easy to carry out / maintain currently? i'm honestly curious if i'm missing some sort of hidden cost that balances out the risk vs reward factors i hear brought up so much by those defending it."
12/6/2016,"compared to other activities in highsec like mission running, mining or freighting stuff around how much is the isk/h and risk/reward out of wack? show us some numbers please"
12/6/2016,"why don't you try it? start from the ground up, don't go join code, but build your own organization. lead gank fleets. you'll need scouts, bumbers, logistics guys to move ships and ammo into systems you plan on ganking in. comms, and even a website might be a good idea. oh, and a srp might not hurt. you can do the latter manually, but alot of groups these days have moved over apps on their websites too.this is another example of the seen vs. unseen. you see the gank and think, ""that is so easy."" but you do not see all the other stuff that went into setting up the gank."
12/6/2016,it's high sec. the implicit safety is gleaned directly from it's name. the balancing factor for high sec based income strategies is to simply modify the returns those players get by remaining there and not venturing out. miner's enjoying too much reward vs the limited risk they face? cut back on their yield. adjust their cycles. make materials harder to get in low risk areas. etcmission runners? cut back on bounty returns. make mission agents pay out less.
12/6/2016,"you are making a big mistake. the gankers income is not determined by the game environment like with miners or mission runners, but by the imprudence of the freighter pilot. the more imprudent the pilot the higher the ganker income. as such, it is not up to ccp to balance it. ever."
12/6/2016,"i'm not talking about large scale gank networks. i'm talking about the simple mechanics of killing another player in high sec and the outcome.you have x number of destroyers. their combined dps is capable of killing ships 1, 2 and 3. a target meeting that criteria is identified and you make your move. target gets caught, damage is applied, target is downed. hauler moves in, loots, and warps off.where is the deterrent? concord only wraps things up. what is keeping a ganker from simply grabbing another ship and doing the same thing twice, if only in another system?"
12/6/2016,"it is still a fairly large coordination problem. again, you are looking at just the final result which is easily seen and ignoring everything up to that point. you have pretty much hand-waved away everything else involved.as for deterrent...how about this: don't be a complete moron when loading up your preferred hauling ship?works for me."
12/6/2016,"ok, so you see a high value freighter moving through high sec and determine that it needs to die. time to score a big pay day right? i'm right there with you at this point.so you get together your fleet and take it out. sure you lost your ships. but man... the reward was enormous. fantastic, seriously good for you, a well executed plan.unfortunately, with the risk of engaging in high sec to catch that big fish, you've got to deal with the consequences. right?what are those consequences? obviously there's no jail, but we have -10 security status and such. yet even that doesn't deter someone from flying in high sec and continuing to gank. and it isn't as if you can't lower your sec status relatively easily anyway.so again, what are the consequences?"
12/6/2016,"you are again wrong. horribly so. the idea of risk is a two way street. why are you not asking yourself why are freighter pilots taking on so much risk? why are they acting as if they were risk seeking and not risk averse or at the very least risk neutral.everyone acts like risk is a one side deal, it isn't. you are only looking at half the picture and saying something is wrong because the gankers faced such low risk for their payday. well why is that? some dummy put way too much cargo into their freighter and flew it stupidly. why are you not asking, ""why was that player so damn dumb?"""
12/6/2016,"let me try it this way....the issue of balance around freighter ganking is in absolutely no way something ccp should be concerned with. the reason for this is it is something that is the result of player choices. unless ccp is going to sit there and monitor freighter pilots cargo value and then ramp up and down concord on the fly it is never going to work.the consequences for the gankers are, relatively speaking, so low is because another player was a completely stupid player. would you take all of your wealth and go gamble it on number 12 at a roulette table in a casino at las vegas? and if you did would you be justified in standing outside the casino railing against them that they took no appreciable risk in your stupid and foolish behavior?well, when you create a ginormous loot pinata why are you looking only at the ganker and not the doofus who overloaded his freighter making it such a tempting target?if you are imprudent in this game there is quite often somebody or somebodies there to show you the error or your ways...and usually in not a very nice manner.working as intended. be prudent and the problem is solved. much like most of life both in and out of game."
12/6/2016,"yes, they already have almost perfect safety compared to low and null and their rewards should be lowered.now if we look at the gankers which are at an extreme disadvantage compared to other pvp players in null and low because they face not only the other players defences but an invincible, all knowing, all powerfull police force which will grant them only a few seconds before vaporising their ships. so here the equation is obviously reversed and if you look at the fact that ganking is absolutely not profitable except for the rare freighters which has too much isk in his belly, ganking is clearly in need of a buff from a risk/reward point of view."
12/6/2016,right ganking miners is not a profitable endeavor.
12/6/2016,also the ability to increase the size of a launchpad so we can have 1 large launch pad rather than 2 or 3.still worth it even if the 'upgrade' takes exactly the same amount of cpu and powergrid. just easier to manage 1 launch pad than 3.
12/6/2016,thanks for your feedback :)
12/6/2016,defending yourself against suicide ganks is probably the most easiest thing in eve. you propose this change to destroy an entire strand of gameplay and opportunities just because you don't like to invest 5min into thinking about how to make highsec secure for your activities.if you had invested the time it took you to write this rather long whine post into examining the game mechanics and your ship/fitting options you would have solved the problem already.
12/6/2016,"from memory, of the hazy past, max runs was actually brought in to stop people making hug run bpc's and taking up slots in the old slot based research and manufacturing system. it had nothing to do with making bpc's not able to be built in large runs, though it does now serve this purpose. (i remember infinite run bpc's and then the introduction of max run bpc's).also the max run had more meaning with the old me system, but as each me is now 1% saving and we are still limited by the 30 day cap i do not see any significant gain from removing this other than if you are working from bpc's (structure components for example) being limited to 7 runs in a build from a bpc rather than 30 days worth from a bpo. so unless it is a method to force people using bpc's to run more slots which just uses up more alt character build slots.it will not affect the build hours (it might actually increase them and the system index as builders will no put in more longer running jobs) as the same hours are in 1 job rather than 2 jobs.and thanks heaps for taking this up. even if ccp come back with some other options something to help manage the number of bpc's."
12/6/2016,i understand the idea of it ruining the market but if you look at it at my prime in building i had 22 alts producing with 10 slots each (11 on some) thats 220+ jobs to do every several hours and with the lag of all the bpc's its a painstaking job to do so often.
12/6/2016,you can have a lot of fun for hours burning only a million isk with frigates or a couple of millions with cruisers. the alpha limitation actually makes sure you can only fly ships which you can properly insure.you can make this isk for your hours of fun in minutes.if you restrict your fun to loosing billions in one shot then that is your problem and not something game design should solve.
12/6/2016,
12/7/2016,"there are plenty of consequences. repeatedly gank in highsec and quickly that character can no longer do anything else in highsec. not only are they free to shoot by anyone, an infallible npc police force starts following them around to the point they can't even sit in space in a ship unmolested. literally all they can do is keep moving in small, fast ships to stay one step ahead of the faction police, and shoot for a brief period of time before another infallible npc destroys them and essentially locks them out of the game for 15 minutes. but you are missing the point. none of these consequences are suppose to prevent outlaws from acting as criminals. if ccp wanted that, they could lock outlaws out of highsec, or just put everyone's safeties to yellow in highsec. ccp has spent a huge amount of effort designing crimewatch to enable criminal and criminal game play to take place in highsec. the fact that criminals can still ply their trade in highsec is completely intentional. the game is designed so that the deck is increasingly shifted in favour of the innocent as a pirate moves from just naughty to a career criminal, but the system is not suppose to prevent criminals from operating. if it was, i would agree with you it fails at that, but it was not. the game designers wanted the other players to serve as sources of risk in this game, and for nowhere to be 100% safe. they thought it would make the game more engaging and enable the player-driven stories they are trying to nurture. nothing especially interesting happens if players can hide behind 100% safe npc protection and still gather stuff. everyone will just do that, only leaving the safe space to engaging in consensual honour fights or meaningless drunken roams, preventing the non-consensual fighting necessary for a competitive game. honestly, highsec has been made increasingly safe over the years to the point that any player can, with a small amount of effort and knowledge, be almost perfectly safe. and over this time highsec has been made much more lucrative, not less, to the point the risk vs. reward balance is seriously tilted away from leaving highsec probably to the detriment of the greater health of the game. as for ""effort"" highsec ganking is certainly more risky, far less lucrative, and requires much more organization than almost all of the pve activities that go on in highsec. any chance at real profit comes only when another player makes a mistake. sure, the act of turning your safeties off and shooting someone is easy, but doing it so that you actually kill your target and make a profit is much harder, especially as an outlaw. this is a sandbox though, and if someone wants to pay the cost and accept the consequence to shoot you in highsec, they can, and if you don't like it it is up to you to use all the advantages the game gives you to shoot them right back and enforce some player-driven consequences on them."
12/7/2016,"i've done my fair share of ganking with miniluv and there's no risk on the gankers end. most of the gankers i know are stinking rich from it. you lose some cheap ships and get a bad sec status, that's all."
12/7/2016,"how many gank targets are capable of defending themselves? i may have been out of the game for a few years, but mining barges/industrials/freighters have not suddenly become pvp capable. high sec ganking is purely to find victims that have as little means as possible to defend themselves, at minimal cost/danger and maximum gain because they determine every aspect of how an encounter will start and end. anything that happens as a result of such actions are merely an inconvenience that does nothing to prevent constant abuse of the current system. npc police retaliation is based on an easily understood formula. once someone has figured out how it works, moving around high sec despite -10 security ratings is simple. gankers complain about high sec police, while simultaneously avoiding them to score kill after kill. you think it takes a pro to just cruise around high sec like that? of course not, any joe blow alpha can do it as much as they like.it really bugs me that i even have to talk about this, because overall, i think ganking should exist. my only real issue with it currently is the lack on consequences and counters. freedom of movement despite garbage security status, targets that cannot defend themselves, and the ability to determine the time and place every engagement begins and ends. downsides being, a lost ship, sec status (lol), and being pigeon holed into one particular occupation in high sec (until they buy their way out). sounds rough."
12/7/2016,"miniluv ganks for profit and they only target valuable ships. yet if you actually crunch the numbers and account for the people involved in a gank and the amount of time it takes to find such a valuable target, the isk/h is extremely lower compared to a miner/mission runner whatever, not even accounting for security status loss and how easy it is for outsiders to screw with the gank and deny the loot.the amount of logistics, preparation, scouting and waiting that goes into the whole gank has to be accounted for if you want to make an argument for how out of whack risk/reward in ganking is.tell me, why are all the isk/h optimizers running missions and incursions if the easy and risk free isk is in ganking?incidentally the same people who whine about how rich we get because we gank and want to nerf (non existing) profits are the same people who will ask for a ban of ganks who are not for profit because the consider it griefing and ""just for tears"".i gank for 3 years or so now and my profits come not from ganking, which is a isk sink for me, it comes from people making mistakes after the gank because they get angry."
12/7/2016,"yes they have. a proper fitted skiff has the tank, speed and damage capabilities of a hac and is able to mine at the same time. it takes a seriously large fleet to take one of this out in a suicide gank where you even lose much more isk on the ganker side than the gankee. we are not even talking about any reward here except a killmail for which you sacrificed more isk than it is worth.the miner got all the tools to protect themselves and more and still people cry for more safety.and you have now shown multiple times that you have absolutely no clue and just argue with your gut feelings."
12/7/2016,"so what? no really, so what? some guy is foolishly imprudent and other players take advantage of it.people look at the old alod (awful loss of the day) articles at themittani.com and would laugh, this is no different. at all. if you fit your cnr with purple modules and then somebody notices and comes along and ganks that guy nobody says, ""oh boo-hoo no risk!"" everyone points and laughs.this is literally the same damn thing."
12/7/2016,"skiffs and procurors are very tough ships now. so tough that it costs more to gank them, alot more, than you'd ever hope to get in loot drops.but aside from that you keep dodging the question i have been asking, why are you not wondering why freighter, industrial and other pilots are taking on so much risk? why are you defending people who are risk seeking...and then finding the down side of that risk.seriously, if you are seeking some specific outcome....and you get it, you should be happy not upset.you are completely muddled and wrongheaded in your thinking here. the counter is: don't be imprudent with your stuff. which goes back to one of the most fundamental rules of eve you have probably used yourself: do not fly that which you cannot afford to lose. this goes for freighters, industrrials, etc.and it bugs you because your, quite simply, wrong. being imprudent in this game has always been punished and always should be. stop trying to molly coddle the imprudent."
12/7/2016,"what risks are you taking by engaging non-combat ships in high-security space? if a ganker sees a target they want to kill, there is literally nothing stopping them from completing that task by bringing the correct amount of dps and picking the right time to attack. repercussions are only faced after the fact, and even those are laughably insignificant. rinse and repeat until you're bored, that is literally the only hard counter to that activity, self imposed of course.you can kill other players who have no interest or expectation of pvp with impunity, you are literally the definition of imprudence. you don't care about the consequences of your actions because you've come to terms with the fact they'll literally do nothing to impede your gameplay. all risk, is front loaded on your victim. you profit off the fact that there is vitually zero risk on your end."
12/7/2016,"you are still quite confused.1. this is true for any and all ships in hs. any ship in hs, with sufficient dps can be ganked. most are not because there is no profit in it. most ships move around hs because people do not like losing more isk than they generate.2. the ships that do get ganked, by and large, are ships that are essentially loot pinatas. this is the result of player choice. let me repeat that, that a ship is a loot pinata is a result of a player's choices.3. by somehow ramping up the risk on those who would gank you are basically saying that players who are foolish and imprudent, so much so they are risk seeking in their actual behavior, should be protected.now please explain why you think 3 is justified when all that needs to happen is for those players to be less imprudent?no. you have it exactly backwards.a player can try to kill any other player in the game by:1. accepting the consequences.2. bringing enough dps.if i accept the consequences after sitting down and looking at the situation that is called being risk averse. risk averse players are not imprudent.you have it exactly upside down.and you are just flat out and obstinately wrong that the risk is ""front loaded on the victim"". the risk was selected by the victim.the victims are taking on too much risk by choice.again let me repeat that:the victims are taking on too much risk by choice.nobody but the victim is putting too much loot onto/into their ship. that is a choice.really, you should stop talking about risk because you just do not understand how it works in this context. risk is not imposed/taken on by the game environment but by player choices. one group of players is prudent (the gankers) the other group (the victims) are not. and stop trying to remove player interactions."
12/7/2016,"and again, can somebody explain to me why everyone is okay with a freighter pilot taking on a crap ton of risk and are then upset when that down side risk actually occurs? why are all these anti-ganking people so keen on forgiving the freighter pilot who turned his ship into a loot pinata? why isn't anyone here crying for those guys who lost dozens of plex while flying a shuttle? why are you guys such a bunch of hypocrites?"
12/7/2016,"as has been said above, skiffs and procurers are incredibly powerful (to the point people roam in them to seeking pvp) and completely uneconomical to gank. simply flying one of them makes you 99.9+% immune to being ganked unless you put a plex in your hold or something foolish. that is an easy and accessible means to protect themselves so i don't know who you think can't do that. and yes, gankers are choosing the engagements that favour them, just like everyone else does in this game. what is the problem with this? no one seeks a fight they cannot possibly win in this game: the smart choice is to evade, or change the equation so that the engagement is in their favour (reship, bring friends, etc.), why do you think highsec should be any different? ccp doesn't. you are intended to have to defend your ships in highsec. ccp has given players plenty of tools to do so. i have never been close to being ganked in highsec because i take the simple precautions to keep engagements in my favour. gankers won't attack if they can't win, and thus i am near impervious in highsec. when i am a criminal i cannot do anything else in highsec. i cannot mission. i cannot haul. i cannot scout. i cannot participate in a war. i cannot even engage in a consensual duel. i am a persona non grata and can only move about in a pod or fast-aligning ship. i have no protection, and you win any fight by simply scramming me and letting the facpo finish me off. i don't know what more ""consequences"" you can pile on me without locking me out of highsec and highsec crime completely. i am all for a complete rethink of how crimewatch works. fights between criminals, victims and law enforcement are one-dimensional and escalation is completely stifled by the current mechanics. if you have a problem with that and want to encourage ccp to think about that, then i am on your side. but if you are complaining that criminals exists, the prepared prey on the unprepared, that players serve as risk for imprudence, or that nowhere is 100% safe, then i have no time for this discussion. ccp intends for highsec to work this way. it has always been that way. ccp is not going to just straight out lock criminals out of highsec because crime offends your sense of honour. highsec is incredibly safe. piracy of normal activities has been nerfed into unprofitability. aside from undertanked miners, overloaded haulers, and autopiloters there is next to zero chance of being ganked in highsec and these risks can be almost completely mitigate with a few simple steps. this is part of the problem, as each nerf to ganking reduced the need to take these precautions in highsec, to the point that many players get complacent and fail to defend themselves but still get mad when another player calls them on their sloppy play and explodes them. some day ccp will get around to looking at criminal mechanics again and hopefully they will come up with something more engaging for all side, and one in which the conflict started by a criminal act can escalate into something more."
12/7/2016,"while i was (and still am) a huge fan of the in game web browser, i have to agree with ccp on this. maintaining such an addition would take a lot of time, and i'd rather that time be spent on game aspects.however, if they could figure out a way of doing without having to maintain it then i wold be all for it."
12/8/2016,does anybody even read these forums?where do i have to post suggestions to be actually read?
12/8/2016,"what i suggested is simply and easy and most important of all realistic:adeqauate punishment for crime.in no society other than in total rotten one is killing somebody a big crime and has drastic consequences,in eve we have nothing, no we as society just say oh well stupid you when you let yourself be killed.the values in reallife are the same as in the game and we should not tell our youngest players that crime is totally ok. eve is about consequences and so should it be for criminals in highsec."
12/8/2016,"1. this is a game which involves shooting spaceships, no one is calling for prison sentences to cod players if the shoot someone2. capsuleers are immortals so no one is actually dying"
12/8/2016,"eve isn't a nice well funded suburb, even in hi-secall of the empire factions are involved in a war, they all have a huge amount of corruption, internicene strife and are riddled with piracy and slaver incursions. you're not running missions in oslo. you're living in, at best, downtown beirut."
12/8/2016,"i agree there should be consequences for those criminals. get out there and enforce some on them! punish them! make those evil gankers hurt!wait, are you asking for someone else to do that for you? why should they protect you and your isk making? shouldn't you do that yourself? besides, don't act all innocent - you are killing thousands of lowly crew members each time you take on one of those missions from those evil sisters of eve folks. eve is a silly spaceship game, not real life. we are immortal demi-gods who literally cannot die. it's all only space pixels. more importantly, crime and criminals are intended game play. i think you need to check your premises friend and perhaps take a step back from the game. immersion is fun and all, but it isn't especially healthy to lose yourself in the role."

12/9/2016,"slack? discord? i thought this was the official channel to communicate with csm.if you're all actually using slack and discord and reddit instead, at least state that somewhere here so those of us who only use this forum know somehow.i feel like talking alone whenever i come here.even a ""suggestion noted"" post would suffice. but not even that.the official stance is that we should get to slack? what should you actually do when you have a suggestion or idea if you want to be taken into consideration?"
12/10/2016,yes this is the official one but very impracticale as its much easier to discuss a topic in a slack/discord channel
12/10/2016,"if you have a suggestion, the best thing to do is to ask yourself ""what problem am i solving with this solution."" that is way more likely to be looked at by ccp and the csm in a way that will lead to action on the issue. we can't know every little niggle that people run into in their experience, so getting down to brass tacks of what's bad before you lay on what would be good is a massive aid to us when presenting things to ccp. all of our twitter handles are here and beyond that, mailing us ingame tends to have pretty fast response times. we're also all active to some degree on tweetfleet slack & the eve reddit. i'm also available on what feels like a million discords, and have my own youtube channel, though currently i don't have any csm content on there. i also have a podcast that i co-host (declarations of war) and i guest appear on many others (such as talking in stations, the neocom & the open comms show) and try and get on any others i can.i am looking to provide a better 'contact us' page at the start of next year, as it's become obvious to me just how outdated it is to list names + twitter handles, when we're active on so many platforms. i think us just saying ""you can reach us here, here, here, here"" would help mitigate a lot of these concerns really. i also debated having a csm discord that was open, but that came with the issues of us having to manually invite shitloads of people, which i didn't think was worthwile.we are also expecting to have our next quarterly review out next saturday, which will help shine a light on some of the more secretive members of the csm."
12/10/2016,i read it i don't agree with you.the meaningful part is that you chose to locate where skills are not seeded.you did not plan ahead and bring them with you when you went wear the skills are not seeded.you made choices.
12/10/2016,"also read it.it is not a new idea. and i do not agree with it.here's the thing; if needing to get skills and transporting them gets you out of a station and moving through space... that puts you at risk of player interaction.so yeah, the act itself is not ""meaningful"" (much like the hauling profession in general)... but it puts you in a position where ""meaningful"" things can potentially happen."

12/14/2016,"o.o what the heck is ""slack"" ? and why the hell always this god damn twitter stuff some people dont use that, discord is just awfull when joining lots of ""channels"" or such, reddit ihmo is just a gigantic wall of text and bores me to death.how about just using the forum section dedicated to the csm ? not only replying to ""where is csm and are they doing anything ?"" type of posts... how about reply to actual ideas posts ?i mean for the ""non tech savvy people"" the easiest and most logical way to go on about eve stuff is yes the eve forum...."
12/14/2016,"the vast majority of players do not use the forums, hence why we do not use them as often as other platforms, where a greater majority of active players are.we do not respond (in general) to idea posts, as we do not have power to introduce them into the development process of ccp and as such. helping to 'develop' them isn't something that is useful beyond giving false hope to people that it's something we're going to be able to 'force through'. we pass them along to ccp if we think they are good and relatively simple to implement for their consideration, or bring up what we see as the core problem of them. at the end of the day, neither you, nor we are game designers. we are a focus group that identifies key problems with areas of the game and brings them to ccp's attention. yes, that may come with some suggested solutions in hand, but it's not often that the solutions (as we intend them) are implemented. that is simply not how the csm operates. as i said earlier on in the thread, i provide biweekly updates on what we're talking about, what we've brought up, and anything else that is relevant to the csm. beyond breaking the nda, that is effectively the limit of what i am able to communicate to the public, as the majority of what else we do is discussing in progress works with ccp devs, which we cannot talk about for obvious reasons."
12/14/2016,tbh i feel more safe in nullsec then in highsec.however the penalty of highsec ganking could be more severe i.e. first gank if you have positive sec status you loose it allif you're below 0.0 sec status you go to -3 third you go to -8 or something in that direction.

12/14/2016,
12/15/2016,so basically what you're saying is you're ignoring the part of us that actually use the official forums ? *slow clap*
12/15/2016,yup i'm definitely 100% ignoring you and that is a fair assessment of what i said.
12/15/2016,"i appreciate that these forums are the way you would like to communicate with the csm, but i disagree with the point that these are the ""official"" way to communicate with us. the ""official"" way to communicate with the csm is whatever way works for both a csm member and the individual player. for example, i read the csm section of the forums (among others) daily to see what players are discussing. that's the value i find here. players, discussing. i find it nearly impossible to have a conversation on the forums simply due to the reply delay and format, and conversations are how i, as a person, communicate best. i also strongly believe in letting opinions evolve organically and without an overly biased input, which is why i try to comment as little as possible.sure, i'd love to see these forums used more overall. i think it would be beneficial to the community and for the players that are highly invested in the csm. i don't think though that anyone, including csm members, should be forced into a medium that doesn't work for them. if i've said it once i've said it a million times... we use a lot of different platforms to talk to the community. reddit, discord, skype, teamspeak, mumble, evemail, forums, email, twitter, slack... hell... some eve players i get valuable feedback out of even have my cellphone number! i would never ask anyone to tie themselves to one platform, so i expect nobody to ask me to do the same.i'd like to reiterate what jin'taan said earlier in this thread. the csm are not junior developers, and while we have easy access to ccp and eve's developers, we are more of a ""sounding board"" or ""filter"". i like to think of us as ""unpaid volunteer consultants"". we sign an nda so that ccp as a company (and business) can discuss upcoming changes with us openly and comfortably while soliciting feedback they might not otherwise have access to. not that this was in question within this thread specifically, but i like to keep that message out there as often as possible so there is no misinterpretation by the player base or voters.lastly, you're not being ignored. the fact that you have had multiple csm's reply to you i would think is clear evidence of that. i don't feel like attacking csm's because they don't communicate the way you expect or feel they should is fair. if you would like to have a conversation with me specifically feel free to send me an evemail or add me on any of the platforms i actively use to converse with players."

12/18/2016,"area of operation: rookie help chatwhat are main problem areas for new players in the new npe?too structured, less exploratory. the npe encourages players to follow an exact script rather than discover on their own. they end up having to reset to checkpoints because they did something ""wrong."" part of this is the deficiencies in eve's ui on a broader scale, but a lot of this is the structure of the npe.what are 3 main <U+FFFD>careers<U+FFFD> new players undertake in eve? (i.e. what gameplay feature do they use the most)mining, obviously. exploration. missions. in that order, it seems. maybe it's just a matter of who makes the most noise in rookie help, but it surprises me a bit how many rookies, especially alpha rookies, are all about doing exploration. any other thoughts?my belief is that eve's terminal weakness is its ui. most of the default ui settings are bad. default window positions/layouts are bad. every vet knows that it takes at least an hour to set up the ui to be able to get the most basic situational awareness. and all those situational awareness tools are spread out across so many different ui systems, rookies especially would not even know they are important. i feel like if the ui was more integrated and natural, the strength of the npe would be far less critical, retention would be higher as players would be able to find their place in the universe both literally and metaphorically, and the game would simply be more fun. after being away from the game for a while, the ui almost kept me from bothering to come back, because doing literally anything with the ui is an unpleasant chore rather than being a fun part of the experience.edit if i'm not too late: area of operation: sheroo, helping with the end of the epic arc fighting daganproblem:simple but fundamental misunderstandings about loadout. in this case, the lesson most seem to fail to learn is that you can dock up and switch from rails to blasters to deal with tough targets. most get that they can switch ammo, but they often end up with the worst guns possible for the fight that requires them to max out their dps. many seem to mix tanks (usually both buffer and active but occasionally also both shield and armor.) some seem to end up with civ gear still fit even that far down the line. it would also be nice if they knew how to do a fleet warp by that point as well, especially since eve is supposed to be a social game (which doesn't teach players how to use the occasionally lackluster social tools.)"

12/21/2016,"hello,i am here for submit my candidacy of stellar management council.about mei started playing eve around summer 2013 as a newbro in test. since then i've spent a ton of time in mostly null, some low and more recently w-space groups. in brief: test - june 2013: as a newbro, just spent time learning the game during the fountain war. eventually left to go try some other stuff after the evac from null was announced. emp - november 2013: joined a new friends corp. spent the halloween war flying with this n3 affiliated alliance that disbanded just a couple weeks after b-r. joined my longest term corp tsk in the fallout of that disband. fcore - february 2014: as honorary members of fountain core, we spent months harassing and ultimately playing a major role in the disband of li3. got my legs for npc null here. black legion - may 2014: tsk was invited to join bl and we had an absolute blast. i wore a lot of hats helping out with a ton of things and became quite trusted here, making a name for myself as someone who could get stuff done. ended up leading the alliance to it's eventual disband in september 2015. tishu - october 2015: tsk joined a growing tishu along with a couple other bl corps. i helped out a lot here and started fcing more regularly. we participated in the whole of wwb alongside pl, and had a ton of fun working out and shamelessly abusing the new strengths of supercaps in low numbers scenarios for the few months after citadel where the rest of the game hadn't quite worked out how they worked yet. hard knocks - august 2016: after tishu disbanded i wanted to try something a bit different and give wormholes a shot. sold all my supercaps and joined hk, absolutely great call. i've had a blast with these dudes so far and getting familiar with w-space completely purged the feelings of bitterness i was starting to have with the game. test - september 2016: a few weeks after joining hard knocks, i put a couple alts back into tsk who had now joined test. here i had a ton of fun fcing on the other end of the blob. i ended up fcing the majority of the large fights in the tribute war that's just closed up. it was a super fun experience, but after a couple months i realised that large sov null alliances still weren't my thing and left on good terms. avrse - december 2016: after leaving test, i joined up again with my old friends from tishu in avrse. my main character there is capri sun superfoods. tl;dr: i've been in a lot of places and generally contributed a lot wherever i've went because eve is only fun for me when i'm playing a highly independent role.the last year i've started a controversial blog and started doing a lot more youtube content.candidacy summaryi've heard from a lot of folks who've served before that anyone going into the csm with an agenda will be disappointed. i don't want to be that person. my view on it hasn't changed from this answer i gave during my run last year.if you're looking for my views on specific issues i'll answer them any in this thread and will likely do an ama nearer the time, but generally speaking my views haven't changed too much. the biggest change i'd say is that my concerns over structures have mostly been alleviated after seeing them in practice for 6 months now.i think with the likely removal of poses, potential changes to aegis sov (of which i've been a strong critic), and major changes to r64s coming up, it's just as important this year as last.if you want to contact me, feel free to evemail me or poke me in #csm on tweetlfeet slack.cheers, capri"
12/21/2016,"if that's really your main in avrse, why wouldn't you post this with your main. instead of your hk (alt?)?"
12/21/2016,"your ""fog of war"" thing is an interesting take, and your comments about the syphons misguided.the pos api was actually modified post-syphon release, to try make it harder to detect a siphon, but quite simply, given the api's that existed before their introduction, it wasn't going to be possible to make siphons undetectable without just chopping that portion of the api off, and considering the number of tools that existing which utilized that part of the api, not only would that of been a damn shame, as 3rd party development is (in my biased opinion) one of the best parts of eve, but also caused public outcry as the users, and creators of these tools are left out in the cold.as for your comments about killboards, there's plenty of kills that go unreported, and if you take a look at many large entitites i.e your dreaded ploons, you'll see ""redacted"" for system names etc, for a set time after the kill is generated(on their internal bored). a kill can only be ""reported"" by two players, the person who got the final blow, and the person who lost the ship. if you don't want your kills getting posted to killboards, don't put your api into them and you've cut down the posting already.as for tieing alts together? the spy meta is as much eve, as permadeath is, and removing it would be a blow to the game. also, why should people be forced to only play one persona in eve? for example i love scamming, but would never scam using the ""christy cloud"" character. eve is a multi-faceted game and alts help players to experience that.--edit :regarding the api's ccp are already making steps, albeit baby steps, towards making the api less intrusive, the main aspect of this being that esi is character based, rather than account based. how this is going to play into nullsec level politics, we don't know. but it's sure to have consequences. selling 2 travelfit erebus 1 rigged 1 unrigged 85bil ea"
12/21/2016,"you can find here more details about my position on siphons in my frist campaign, including a post by ccp clearly stating that siphons were not to be detected by api. if the knowledge that siphons would be detected, and that was a technical necessity, i am sure other discussions could have been held to balance the siphon differently.i am not going to focus more on those this year as passive moon income only has a few months left anyway. still, i do hope the concept of active gameplay siphoning passive income will exist in the future, as this is a design that by its nature would affect more the larger and richer entities of the game to the benefit of the smaller ones.if only one of the player has given his api to his corp/alliance, the killmail will be reported no matter what the other player choses. a killmail has to be reported manualy only if neither player belongs to a killboard driven group, which most groups are nowadays. so the odds of a kill not uploaded are really low...i am not talking about removing the spy meta. spies, betrayals and scams are part of eve because they are also a part of our social construct, and eve is as much a sci-fi experience as a social one.the only thing i am pointing out is that there is no drawbacks in the game for having a spy account, and this is the most risk free activity in the game. my suggestion would introduce a minor economic drawback to not chosing to link one account to the same player's other accounts, and leave to each player the decision to link their account together, with a litttle economic incentive to do so."

12/22/2016,"well that explains why you haven't had any fleets out lately. there are rumors of an invasion in the south, might be fun."
12/22/2016,about time v2.0; let's see if we all do the smart thing and not rob you like last year.
12/22/2016,i wholeheartedly endorse this product and/or service. capri is brilliant and articulate and thoughtful and exactly what would make a good csm member.
12/22/2016,hmmm
12/22/2016,mega vouch. capri is a good man who can really represent a large number of eve players. his experience in so many different types of game play really sets him apart from other candidates.how do you address the allegations that capri sun don't have enough juice in him though?
12/22/2016,will you deliver foods at reasonable shipping costs?
12/22/2016,"i promise i'll vote for you this year caprithere's no use crying after every mistake, you just keep on trying 'til you run out of cake."
12/22/2016,yes please
12/22/2016,mfw i realize capri has been meming us the entire time. looks like its time to get a new main alt. wtb vouch @doomchinchilla
12/22/2016,"you took a lot of flak in the most recent iteration of tishu for making fc-level mistakes and then blaming other people, rather than publicly owning up to mistakes and then trying to improve and get better.being a strong fc is not a requirement to run for csm, but being honest and realistic with yourself and others certainly should be.what have you learned or changed about yourself in the past few months that merits a vote for csm?"
12/22/2016,"has my vote. my main (in gotg currently, charname opsec) has had a similar upbringing to you. good ideas mate."

12/22/2016,"i think the one or two welps in particular you're talking about can be aptly summed up by saying capri would rather jump in and ask questions later than not enjoy playing a videogame and save a few insurable space pixel carriers, which i am 100% down with that philosophythe rest of your comment is pretty much moot+1 capri for space illumittani"
12/22/2016,"i would vouch for capri any day of the week.i've flown with him in both test and bl, and he's a super guy all around. he knows his mechanics. he knows the game. he has a great understanding of what is good for the game and what isn't."
12/22/2016,"so, serious question here. do you believe that - as a csm - you will be able to 'make' a feature like this come to fruition? and if so, how would you plan to go about doing so?"
12/22/2016,"ccp stated that they were going to make siphons undetectable, and changed the api to reflect this, players then just modified their setups (if i remember rightly you simply piped your income into a second silo, and it displayed the real amount) ccp realised that it was either going to be a game of cat and mouse with 3rd party devs, or a scenario where they just had to chop that section of the api out. so they admitted defeat, and just revealed the true stats.that's still an opt-in system, you choose to be in a corp, and that corp chooses to add it's key to a killboard. you say that most corps are, but that doesn't change the fact a group, if they're so worried about the free intel this provides, can simply opt not to.this would be an entirely new system, which isn't really the territory of the csm to drive. not to mention this does nothing to address the so-called ""problem"" of unrelated accounts, as the person can just choose to eat whatever ""economic drawback"" you have in mind. even in the case of my alts which actively fly together and i have no problem with people knowing are related, i'd opt to not have an actual ingame trail linking them, and that's an opinion i imagine a large percentage of players share. selling 2 travelfit erebus 1 rigged 1 unrigged 85bil ea"
12/22/2016,"bear in mind, it's not an economic drawback you're proposing.it's a change to the baseline. because someone who has a single account would be hit by it.so what you're really taking about is a bonus for people who have alts. and if i have 4 accounts, i can have 2 sets of related accounts, getting the bonus, without giving away all the information.(looking for exploitable issues in proposals _is_ part of the job of the csm)"
12/22/2016,"no.as i said, i believe csm members are elected lobbyists, and the csm should represent a wide variety of play-styles. if i get elected, because this idea is on my platform, it will mean that there is enough players that are interested by it for ccp to consider it seriously.after that, implementing or not is strictly their decision.there are precedents of csm members 'making feature come to fruition' in the past, like lobbying ccp to reduce the connections between whs and null sec to limit more the ability of wormholers to mess with the null sec empires, a ploons-centric agenda item."
12/22/2016,"i embrace eve online for what it is: a game of alts. it would introduce a concept akin to 'bulk-buying' benefit for those getting multiple accounts and linking them publicly together. what you seem to be implying if that if i bulk-buy items, i penalize those that only buy one. is that what you mean when you say that someone with a single account would be hit by it? one idea i already put out there for discussions (without any visibility into relevant data) present more clearly a possible concept of 'bulk-buying' for eve accounts:for each account publicly linked together by the same player, each account benefit from one extra day of subscription.so if i link 4 accounts publicly together, each account will get 4 extra days of subscription/plexing.if i link publicly two accounts and then two other accounts separately, each accounts will get only 2 extra days of subscription.hence the effect of 'bulk-buying works and those chosing to keep accounts separated would have a minor economic loss in exchange for insulating their in-game actions from their other toons, which currently has 0 drawback.obviously, measures have to be put to define and control what defines as ""same player"", but ccp already gathers a bunch of relevant information about each account."
12/22/2016,"true. what i am saying is that this fundamentally changed the usefulness of the siphons, and their design should have been revised, but did not because nobody in the csm cared, as they were mostly representing the player base that would be most impacted by a more efficient siphoning mechanic. your agument is specious. when you enter a corp and most alliances today, you *have* to give apis and you have no options to opt out of feeding killboards if you want to stay.this is all i am asking, an option with a carrot. on my previous campaigns i approached this with a stick mentality, which was wrong. there is no way to address the problem of unrelated accounts, other than encouraging a minor positive economic benefit for those that chose to link their accounts together, that the scammers could not benefit from."
12/22/2016,"thank you for clarifying that. i see many candidates running with the sole intent of getting one or two features added, which is simply not the purview of the csm, and basically just lying to those who vote for you. i will not address the ideas, as quite frankly i don't see that as part of the csm process. saying you're in favour of something is just a way to make your positon on an issue more clear and i can respect that.what would you say your areas of expertise are within the game, either in terms of community or mechanical knowledge?"
12/22/2016,"greeting capsuleers of new eden,i am running for the first time in the election for csm xii.let me tell you a bit about myself and a bit of my history in new eden.i am 20 years old and i am an air traffic controller in the u.s army, i have lived in phoenix arizona for about 17 years. i started playing eve a few months before i enlisted, where i had joined a small c3 pulsar wormhole corp and learned the basics about wormhole life. after basic training i really got into eve while i was in school for my mos (military occupational specialty). during my time at school i had accumulated 4 accounts, and was part of 2 alliances (serenity initiatve and test alliance) and i got into trading toons for isk. eventually i made enough isk to get to where i am today, with 6 accounts and about 10 toons each with a different specialty. after school i had about 4 months before i deployed overseas. which during all of our pre-deployment training; the i-10 shooter was around and i had to drive that same route 2 times a day to get where i needed to be, luckily i never got shot :)from that point i deployed and i pretty much sat around doing nothing 95% of the time, and i joined darkness and helped in wwb, a few weeks into wwb my corp left darkness and went to i n f a m o u s, and i attempted to create my own wh corp and got evicted before our astrahus could finish it's ""after anchoring repair cycle"" and so i was taken in to mcav, which is where i have been since then. since most of my accounts have skilled miners i have left wh space, because ore sites are not plausible or profitable in w-space.first and foremost; i want to bring up some ideas for csm. i want to help make wh space great again! we all know that wh space needs a healthy population of capsuleers moving in, and i want to help make that happen. help make wh space not boring (this includes the possibility of new sites, better escalations, and a new player influx) mining in w-space is somewhat lacking... i want to help make it better for potential wh mining corps.

12/23/2016,"since ccp is now redoing pve content, definitely need to present this proposal to them.dmc"
12/23/2016,"it's in my opinion that you've poorly highlighted the problem, and focused on the solution. your issue is that standings are currently difficult to attain and manage, as you are proposing a way to make it easier (rather than highlighting 'interesting content' with regards to pve that has been removed). standings and how they work are something we would like to look at, especially given the amount of alpha players who are going into fw and not realising the impact that this has on their standings until far later into the game.this is especially relevant given the way standings work with the new mining convoys, which are something i think represents a huge step forwards in using standings more actively in gameplay.also please don't sign your forum posts. you aren't sending a letter to us."
12/23/2016,"i always do because yes, i am sending a letter to yoummike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
12/23/2016,"i am very familiar with mechanics related to null sec and wormholes, and pvp in general. i started playing in 2009 and i spent half of this time playing in each of these areas.i am less familiar with life in low sec and high sec.i do not make isks from trading, mining, producing, scamming, moonmining, taxing, salvaging, ransoming, incursions, pi, missioning, stealing, pve or fw farming, hauling and i plex my accounts.my play-style is mostly detached from the large alliances and blocs, and my alliance helps solo players and micro-corps toward a more independent play-style, for those interested."
12/24/2016,"there's an old saying - opinions are like arseholes, everybody has one, some just stink more than others.if you had bothered to read the proposal with an open mind, you would have seen i clearly stated the problem which is the original content previously known as tutorial agents had been removed by ccp and replaced with the npe aura tutorial. a little while later the npc aura tutorial was removed and the 60 stations that were home to the incorrectly named tutorial agents became empty, resulting in a major loss of activity in those systems.also you couldn't be more wrong when you say my issue with standings is that they are difficult to attain and manage. obviously you're not familiar with 'the plan' which i created and gave to the eve playerbase back in 2010.as for new alpha players, i totally agree that not knowing the impact of standings can easily mess up their gameplay options. this proposal can actually help them resolve that issue.i agree 100% and i couldn't have said it better myself. the only thing i can add is that i'm not actually signing my forum posts since that would require a signature. i just initial them which makes it a bit more personal.dmc"
12/24/2016,"i did read your post, hence why i tried to articulate what your issue was and address it. please try not to conflate misunderstanding your point with not reading it.the problem i have is that you have not elaborated on why these agents are necesary and what the costs of removing them were to the game. you noted that the benefit of them was that they gave a standings increase, and this is something that i understood as a problem within the game, so i addressed it. you didn't say that you enjoyed the missions, so i assumed that the pve content itself was not the draw, leaving only the standings impact as a benefit to the playerbase as highlighted by you. this in particular is something i do not understand as a 'downside'. there are plenty of underused systems in the game, especially in hisec. why is this a concern that needs to be addressed from a gameplay standpoint? i'm not being facetious here, i genuinely would like to know, as it's not a conversation i've had before. difficult for those who've not read that plan, then. they're not an intuitive or easy to follow system, which is why i do not agree with bringing back the old tutorial agents when it would be by far more beneficial to the game to look at standings in their entirety, especially with regards to how they are damaged and repaired.and, whilst i was not aware you had wrote it, i was aware that - much the same with sec status - guides exist for repairing standings. however, this is not in my opinion a good way to present mechanics to players in the long run. in an ideal world, players would be able to get close to optimal results without having to resort to expert advice outside of the client."
12/24/2016,"greetings capsuleers, with this post i am officially anouncing my candidacy for csm xii.ill start buy telling you guys my platform i will run on. and then tell you my background.my platform is a no fluff straightforward approach. i dont intend to convince new eden to vote for me with false promises and ""big dreams.""i will be representing a pvp view point to the csm and will do my best to represent that play style to the council and ccp.i intend to be my community's voice to ccp and nothing more. no personal goals. no sneaky ambitions.i intend to hold as many chats with the players of new eden (not just my alliance) as often as possible to better hear and convey the thoughts and concerns of the wonderful pilots of new eden.background: i started playing eve mid '13 and was hooked immediately. i started as many do as an indy bro, mining and building my ass off. after tasting my first blood in a coalition pvp roam i decided i no longer wanted to build ships, and instead would rather blow them up.i have ran a few corps here and there and flown with some amazing pilots. lived everywhere from hs to null with tiny touches of wh in between.my habit in this game is pvp. but my passion is black ops. pilots that know me know that if im online, im waiting on a cyno.recently my corp found a home in the alliance co2 and we feel we have found a good home. within just a very short time here im heading up the blops group for co2.with that i ask you guys to ask any questions you wish and i will answer them as fast as possible with honest and sound answers."
12/24/2016,"a few questions:""i want to help make wh space great again! we all know that wh space needs a healthy population of capsuleers moving in, and i want to help make that happen.help make wh space not boring (this includes the possibility of new sites, better escalations, and a new player influx)""these points are pretty vague and don't really entail knowledge of the issues with w-space. can you add some more specifics on how you would intend to interface with ccp to do stuff like this?""mining in w-space is somewhat lacking... i want to help make it better for potential wh mining corps. ( i have 4 hulks and an orca and can mine better in nullsec)we all know c6's are pretty much dead, i am going to try my hardest to make c6 space attractive.""same for these, actually. i would recommend expanding on your ideas otherwise you'll get these 2 questions all the time, and it saves you the trouble.as someone who lives in c6 space (albeit on alts), i do think that making c6 space ""great again"" to a w-space player perspective is not as easy as it seems. in tweetfleet, the number one thing people have discusses is adding dual statics to c6s. it would likely cause a mass exodus of c5 corps though. why live in c5 with a single static, and trashed site respawn rates if everyone is in c6? i'd like your input.also, you haven't addressed the issue with z142 nullsec holes in c5 space being closed but still being visually ""open"". do you plan on interfacing with ccp to try and get this bug fixed?"
12/25/2016,"these agents are event agents which could only be completed once in the life of the character for faction standing increase. they were important due to the fact that there was 15 of them for each of the 4 main empires which made it easy for players to regain faction standing. their original 2 part mission series was actually quite easy to complete which contributed to them being important in regards to faction standing increase.the main problem is that they were never really listed or publicized like regular agents and they were situated in the last system of dead-end pipelines with no other agents, thus they didn't get much activity. since they've been removed and the fact that no other agents are located in those dead-end systems basically turns those systems into unused content that's a waste of server resources.most players didn't even know they existed until i published my first draft of 'the plan' which actually contains quite a few event agents. i'm talking about content that was un-publicized and rarely used in-game. 'the plan' brought attention to that content and as a result more players engaged in that content.dmc"
12/25/2016,"ok, so the communication of the content was bad initially, but you still seem to not be getting my point;you miss them because of their usefulness in acquiring standings for characters who need it. i understand and accept that, however i can't help but feel that a better solution which is more intuitive (tags for standings al<U+FFFD> tags for sec) or a full rework of the standings system would be a better solution to the need that these agents solved. i recognise that you put a lot of time into your plan, but times do change, and so do systems like standings. bear in mind that i'm not arguing against the idea of reintroducing them as a stock gap, but you do at least agree that the process of standings repair could be better implemented within the client to be more intuitive, no?also fun fact, unoccupied systems use next to no resources, as they share nodes with other systems. this is why node reinforcing puts 1 system onto 1 'super' node. if you want to make the argument that less underpopulated space is bad and that these agents caused 'temporary migration', cool, but i really don't see that as a valid argument within hisec, as most pve content in hisec scales incredibly well vertically, whereas income from industry does not, giving basic incentives to both spread out and congregate. plus, concentrating people in an area increases the chance of player socialisation which has been shown to massively increase retention :)"
12/25/2016,"no, i get your point and yes, i agree that the process of standings repair could be better implemented within the client to be more intuitive. however ccp doesn't like to present things in black & white. they prefer various shades of gray and enjoy seeing the player base figure things out on their own. ccp distributes the content throughout the game for players to find and put the pieces together. players then share that info with the community. that's what makes this game great.a full re-work of the standings system would require a lot of dev time and resources, not to mention it would probably remove a lot of the existing pve content, mainly event agents. i never liked the idea of tags for security and i definitely don't like the idea of implementing tags for standing. that makes it way too easy for players to circumvent consequences for their actions.all of the empty systems that were formerly occupied by those removed agents may not be a drain on the server but it's definitely a waste of time and effort invested by the dev's who had originally created that content. when those agents were active a small percentage of the player base actually engaged with that content, thus validating the resources used to create that content. my proposal is to not only bring those agents out of retirement but to also improve and upgrade their content for the benefit of all capsuleers. they could be classified and listed as political agents in the games agent finder. they could even be coded similar to the epic arcs, available to be redone once a year which would be very beneficial in repairing and maintaining positive faction standings.i understand this content may seem outdated and worthless to you but aside from doing a full standings rework, this proposal would be very easy to implement resulting in more content for all players to interact with in-game. anyway, i sincerely thank you for taking the time to review this proposal and more importantly, for taking the time to discuss it with me.dmc"
12/25/2016,"on the other hand, skill injectors and plex can be consumed remotely, which otherwise would create even more meaningful gameplay. but i would rather like skill books become player made, which eliminates that problem."
12/25/2016,"good day fellow capsuleers.so, breaking this down into a couple sections, an about me, about my eve time, my goals, and my plan. here we go.1) about me:30 year old it guy, young family man, dedicated gamer, eve guy, all that usual stuff that doesn't set me any different from most other eve players. i have a strong background in advocacy and been involved with local/provincial/federal politics before, so i'm well aware of the ""joys"" of campaigning, advocacy and generally getting myself well out there.i have been involved in enough red tape and beaurocracy to crush most people, and i want to do my best to cut through that, provide great feedback, listen to the community, and plan for the next year of eve.2) my eve time:for a large majority of my eve time, i have been an apostle of bob. i have lived in many small/medium sized wh groups, with varying reputations, from unknown, to laughed at, to respected, to simply just around. i have been a director or better for the better part of my last 5 years in eve. i have dealt with the struggles of things such as pos mechanics, wormhole living, and everything else one has to do to survive in j-space, and this is where my expertise comes from, and where i think i can make a big difference to the future of eve.3) my goals:my primary focus on eve will be player interaction with the csm/devs and pvp. these things are what i want to bring my best efforts to in the game. i want to improve small/mid gang pvp experience, as well as bring forward those ideas that get lost in the shuffle of all the voices in eve.4) my plan:regarding csm communications:i plan to have 6 bi-monthly open house discussions regarding various aspects of eve (specically, hs, ls, null, wh, pve, and industry) which will have round table discussions open to all participants that we can record, and then deliver to the dev team to help them improve the game for all of us.on top of this, i will have an in game channel available for anyone to join, which all members of the csm will be moderators for, which will allow for direct communications with the csm. after all, we are the representatives of the players of eve, so we should be listening to everyone who has a good opinion.on top of each of those round table discussions, each will have a 10-15 minute segment for the ""little things"" quick suggestions that will make eve infinitely better, that could be as simple as just adjusting a colour.regarding wormhole living:myself, and several other ceos/directors of some fairly large and well established wh entities are in the process of creating a day 1 help channel for the wormhole experience. where we can answer questions, provide feedback, teach, and improve people's ability to play in wh space. this, in combination with developing a single source wiki by wormholers for wormholers to take away a bit of the mystery and provide knowledge to players who may not have been blessed with knowing a large wormhole entity.direct game improvements:i have many concrete things i want to push for wormhole space to help improve the game for everyone involved. a) give c6s a 2nd static. the other even class whs all currently have 2 statics, which i think should be implemented to make them a tastier place to live in. i think every c6 should recieve a null sec static, with the ability to have capital class ships (not supers or titans), and upto a 5 bil total mass limit on them.b) i want to change how cyno inhibitors work. i want them to be much cheaper than they are. they are currently on the market for 60 million isk a pop. they take 2 minutes to anchor and have a 1 hour long lifespan. i propose, that they get a reduction to a 20s activation timer, and a lifespan reduction of 15 minutes, on top of that, they should be manufacturable with perfect skills for approximately 4.5 million isk, which should make their market price in the 5-6 million isk range. this will encourage groups (not just wormholers, but other null sec groups fighting as well) to drop them, and help make straight cynoing in a bit less effective in the long run.c) i want to implement fleet bookmarks. what i would suggest is 50 bookmark slots to be created when a fleet is created, and the moment the fleet despawns, so do all the bookmarks, this allows for fleets of people who aren't necessarily in the same corp to be able to work together off bookmarks and assests as needed, without having the fuss of providing warp ins and/or creating/contracting bookmarks around.d) i want to bring api checking into the game. it is such an essential part of how the game works already we should be able to verify apis in game without having to leave the immersion of the game to do director level duties.well, that's my starting talking points, to any of the eve press groups who would be interested in interviewing me, please contact me, and we'll arrange something. also for those people who know me in wh space, i am doing this because i legitimately believe that we need more csm representation for wormhole space. noobman has in my mind been the best csm representative in recent memory, and i think i would be able to work with him, and as hard as him in order to best bring about changes to the game, not just for wh space, but for everyone."

12/25/2016,"what does this achieve? there are already class six wormholes that possess nullsec statics (non-capital capable mind you), and to the best of my knowledge they're empty.do you realize how overpowered this is, not just in a combat point of view but they can easily be spammed in a system to prevent cynoing to any near-safe location as with present. and with the combat point of view, you now have a twenty secound window to notice and light your cyno coupled with the cyno inhibitor spam that will occur causes will cause more trouble than you anticipate. i don't believe you have ever flown a capital in k-space otherwise you would know how overpowered what you're suggesting is.something like this is actually cool, but we've managed to survive thus far.given the track record of features being added into the game client, see the in game ghost fitting being subpar to any third party application. i don't have much hope in any system being added to the client."
12/25/2016,i think this is a good idea
12/25/2016,"given the track record of features being added into the game client, see the in game ghost fitting being subpar to any third party application. i don't have much hope in any system being added to the client.third party developers have always done their best and delivered some truly amazing products to the eve community, i definitely agree with you there. but something like an api reader should be a fairly basic add to be honest, and there isn't a whole lot of real extra work that needs to be done. i mean, with ccp implementing ingame shadow fitting already, i think their plan is to at least provide basic alternatives to 3rd party tools. this might even qualify as one of those ""little things"" fixes that can be implemented in an afternoon."
12/25/2016,"would you care to elaborate? the great thing about this process is that it's a vote, so if you don't want to see me there, please don't vote for me, i'm not holding you at naglfar point or anything."

12/25/2016,"hello my name is winthorp, most people call me winny. i have been in wh space for many years and am bitter as hell as i had to leave wh's for the content of nullsec after wh space had been ruined by constant interventions by ccp. i had hoped our savior the noobman could fix wh space but well he is a pl guy as we all know just like all of hk are pl alts (and all of lzhx's are just farm alts as there ceo is literally pubway shi of hk) so he has only been working on ""the sphere"". now i normally wouldn't run for something like this as people find my honesty confronting but the three latest wh candidates to run (the first had been playing for three months and the second is absurdly ******** followed by capricokedupkraft foods who will only bore us his entire term with confusing blogs that will sit on the fence and give no insight to an issue apart from using many intelligent words jumbled together like a child licking chalk on his first day of kindy) it left me little choice. now i know people think the csm just listens to ccp's plans and advises, yeah look were this has got us. wh's are empty as centerlink on a friday afternoon and you can make more cash monies afking an ishtar in nullsec so here is what i will be telling them ccp guys how it is going to go down going forward. <U+FFFD> firstly i expect my trip to iceland because as an aussie it is way far for us to travel the world on our own coin m8 and dont get me started on how damn hot it is here. <U+FFFD> now we need to delete them c6's lads. they used to be controlled by some twerp russians but well they rmt that so ccp had to ban them and now it is just controlled by my old m8 brax and he just cant keep up with all them heroic naglfars that wanna stream them 12 siege cycle exploits so ima help him out and delete all that trouble. <U+FFFD> im going to make escalations in c4 space becaise all the tru pvp corps have gone there andwe need to help them out and fund them. <U+FFFD> now that we got dem whs fixed it is onto the jesus features. local chat will have a 20sec delay to even things up so we can warp together with them back thier pos of friendship chatting away together like it was xmas dinner. <U+FFFD> seems all these bloc csm's have had some of there own jesus features with all these bloody rorquals stealing all the ore from all the small kids in the playground. and with the introduction of alphas we will help them out with banning all cynos on grid with a rorqual using its new seigy tool thingy."
12/25/2016,i have heard the low class whiners carry on that they need some goodies too. so i will be deleting all combat sigs/sites from c1-3 and adding more ore sites for them to use the capital class mining vessel the almighty rorqual. you will be forever safe because the meanies in c5-6 can't bring the caps.

12/25/2016,10/10 candidate didn't steal my aeon
12/26/2016,"no worrries, thank you for being willing to engage me in debate here and not flip out when i took a different stance. i'll definitely bring this up in our next meeting with ccp and ask if this was made as a design decision or as a consequence of simply purging a lot of previous content to replace it with the inception npe. hopefully from there i'll be able to talk to ccp about it further. obviously, no promises of action, as i've said before, the csm doesn't have the power to direct workflow, and whilst you might expect it to be just flicking a switch to bring the agents back, chances are that a lot of background engineering would have to be done to add new agent finder filters, reimplementing the mission pool, without disturbing the existing tutorial path."
12/26/2016,"organisation name: mercenary academyorganisation size: 300+organisation goal: training w/potential graduation into mercenary coalitionarea of operation: lowsec based, semi-nomadicwhat is the most common question new players ask?the majority of questions i get are about fitting and skill plans. what mechanical misunderstandings (if any) do you see new players make?isk spent does not equal better in all circumstances. yes those purple mods are awesome, but it's about cost benefit ratios. i've found that the loss of such ships quickly fixes that behavior though what topics aren<U+FFFD>t covered in the current npe that you think could be?as a pvp focused organization, the ships we use are varied and will change how we engage in combat. since alphas are racial locked, a description of what each races ship bonuses are (similar to the small section near race selection on the ship tree) would be extremely useful, telling the player, before they're locked in, how their chosen race fights. there's a portion of the npe where you're flying with the assembled fleet and your guide tells you how to look at ships. if it taught you how to show info, new players would now have a skill that would let them educate themselves about new ships, and subsequently everything else in the game.what areas of the npe do you feel don<U+FFFD>t adequately cover the topic (if any)?the biggest flaw in the npe is that while it teaches you how to do things, it doesn't explain why. you know that you should orbit, but why is it a good idea? don't need a breakdown of what transversal is, just tell them it's hard to be hit when you fly in circles.what are main problem areas for new players in the new npe?mostly getting ahead of themselves and have to restart because they did something faster than the npe told them to.what are 3 main <U+FFFD>careers<U+FFFD> new players undertake in eve? (i.e. what gameplay feature do they use the most)exploration, ratting, faction warfareany other thoughts?i think the framework of the npe is in a good place. i don't see it as a method for fully teaching the game, that's my job, but as a set of rails to get them pointed in the right direction i find it immensely helpful. minor improvements would help for sure, but i think it's beneficial to the community to have players teaching players. it helps us grow, encourages involvement, and fosters comradery"
12/26/2016,"how are you not in the csm already? i like your blog, you have my vote"
12/26/2016,"since ccp strongly stated there's no way to get rid of the lobbyists assembly that is the csm, any other agenda than ns powerbloc""s will be absolutely fine for me.i just hope we'll have enough candidates outside the usual koolkids to push as much as possible of them to endie's oblivion"
12/27/2016,"thank you very much for offering to use this proposal as a base topic to confer with ccp. that in itself is a major accomplishment and i don't expect anything more. i do realize ccp has been looking at faction standings with plans to rework the game mechanic governing it. even if ccp likes this idea or any aspect of it, i don't expect to see any results happen quickly. i know it takes a lot of time and resources for dev's to code, test and implement content into the game.once again thank you for reviewing this proposal and discussing the overall value of it with me. i wish you much success in your career as a csm member.dmc"

12/29/2016,"hey guys, thank you all so much for your answers. there's a lot there that both the csm & team genesis (the ccp team behind the new npe) are going to be interested in digging into. please keep them coming, as they're an important part of helping us to find out where the most common issues and areas that new players expand into are.but, for those of you who wish to attend the audio roundtable, i have some more details for you;we will be starting it at 20:00 eve time on january the 7th, and it will be streamed & recorded (either by myself or people with more technical expertise) so that anyone who wishes to can comment or add more input to the process. it will be held on a discord server, as it's one of the easiest things to set up, and has an integrated text client for those unable to talk. if you wish to join the sever now and discuss beforehand, you are welcome to, as an invite link is available here. bear in mind that i obviously reserve the right to kick anyone who is negatively impacting the overall discussion, so please, try and contain your edge.with all that said, have a great new year, and i look forwards to talking with you all to improve the start given to our newest recruits."
12/29/2016,kill mails are center of eve experience. those who are attackers side kill mail means job well done and those who are victims side kill mail means i will get my revenge.i propose adding give isk and place bounty buttons for kill mail. those who want to reward attackers can use give isk button. this would give isk divided to all attackers. those who want to punish attackers can use place bounty button. this would place bounty divided to all attackers. minimum isk/capsuleer for bounty would still be 100 000 isk and same 100 000 isk limit could exist for kill mail give isk button. kill mail link would be connected to isk transfer.comments are welcome for my idea! i made several years ago this idea in forums and now i decided to release it again in csm forum area.
12/30/2016,"even very limited in-game browser allowed players to pass extra info in much more convenient way, making game process much more expressive. ccp, please bring it back. maybe you can use chromium (free version of browser)?"
12/31/2016,"first off, kill mails are not the center of the eve experience.secondly, what you want already exists in game. right click the pilot and choose either bounty or give money.saving one click is a pointless waste of dev time."
12/31/2016,"they were using chromium.eve is like an addiction; you can't quit it until it quits you. also, iderno"
