1/1/2010,"while i fly entirely caldari myself, i have to disagree with this on the grounds it would make missiles to powerful overall. i do not disagree that it's kind of a screw up for bonuses thou.maybe instead of the 5% make it 3% bonus to damage overall.or a 5% reduction in explosion radius, thou there is a skill that already does this.my two cents"
1/1/2010,"i cross trained caldari to fly drake in stead of hurricane, cuz it's just better, that said i do not support this. some caldari missile boats need help, not all. this blanket approach will make certain ships *cough drake cough* ludicrously op.- sort rockets out- adjust individual ship bonuses that need it.this blanket ""rainbow bonuses"" begging session is either utterly blinkered ignorance or a desperate attempt at ""make my drake lolwtfpwnsaucefotm pleeeeaze"""

1/1/2010,to guy with phoon.ppl were talking about caldari boats. matar discution is that way p.s. phoon bonuses 5% bonus to siege and cruise missile launcher rate of fire per leveltoo all damage types ;) i want that too you know ? :d
1/1/2010,"you would have to tweak missile damage (especially heavies/hams) so you don't end up with too much of a good thing, provided if that is done i see no reason to hold on to that outdated bonus.then again, kinetic may lose some hitting shields, but gain a lot hitting armour .. you conveniently neglected to mention that t1 armour tankers generally have low explosive and kinetic resists, 5-25% difference depending on race (gallente having highest base kin).with t1 armour making up a vast majority of ships flown (in pvp) a kinetic bonus is actually a pretty damn good thing.the ability to choose damage type is no longer a missile boon since projectiles have pretty much the same now, so missiles biggest advantage is range and invulnerability to the infernal tds.all in all, no."
1/1/2010,"supported.i read as far as post 116 then had to skip to the end. too much to read! while i agree that the ship bonuses should apply to all ammo types fired, the caldari should still be encouraged to primarily use kinetic damage.this could either be by : a) giving all missile ammo a kinetic component to its damage (maybe 25% as suggested earlier?)orb) the drone bonus method. give each missile ammo type its own varied characteristics. kinetic missiles would do the most raw damage, but another would have better explosion velocity, and another have better flight time etc.t."
1/1/2010,i could almost support this on one condition... (by this is mean the op not that ^^^) ...it does not apply to drake or cerb as they just don't need it. but since i suspect that this proposal (or at least some of the agreement with it) is more about making those 2 ships lol op and not about helping the other cmbs i don't expect anyone to agree to this very reasonable condition.
1/1/2010,"not signedmissiles users are able to choose their damage types, while all other weapon system users must deal with ""impure"" damage types. projectiles are the closest to missiles in being able to choose damage types, but have to deal with several other problems (clip size, ammo size, poor dps)."

1/1/2010,"look it he other way: - an account totally dedicated to gathering datacores (6 of the best agents for each character) will generate a little more than 1.000 datacores/month (without running missions). creating the account will require several months as you need the skills at 5 (including 2 millions sp for research project management at 5) and standing with 2 corporation at least. - average 30 day licence in my part of eve 260 millions. - so average price for datacores to get even on one account cost gathering datacores 260.000 and the account owner isn't getting anything back for the 6 or more months spent creating the characters. a average price above 300k would be more credible and i still doubt it would entice people to create datacore gathering accounts. - looking the market prices for datacores i would say the average seem to be around 200k.- so changing this would increase the cost of inventing by at least 30%.for me it would be an advantage as all my accounts are constantly subscribed, but it would be a bad blow for inventors. if the goal is higher cost t2, go for it."

1/1/2010,"the system of corporate roles as it presently exists is confusing, frustrating, and overly prescriptive. as a result it is often misused and abused, gets in the way of corporation leaders empowering their members as it forces to entrust too much or not enough in many cases, and isn't suited to the growing needs for pan/inter-alliance roles. partially current system is to blame for closing part of gameplay to majority of players (like poss) and one of main obstacles in doing the much needed overhaul of management tools (like station management tools, corporation management tools, pos management etc).one of the solution would be to move away from the prescriptive model of predefined corporate roles bestowed upon individuals, and toward a system of privileges granted to user groups (ug) defined freely by the players, and applied to in-game 'objects'.the general spirit of the model is inspired by the permissions/accesses and users management in effect in many forum engines, computer storage file-systems and operating systems, all tried and true solutions eve users (and player organizations managers especially) are more likely to be familiar with than any newfangled 'original' model.this much more 'sandboxy' approach to player self-governance inside alliances and corporations is in line with eve overall design, and creates a wealth of opportunities for emergent gameplay once players have the tools to create whatever form of social contract they deem appropriate, instead of the current 'one-size-fits-none' corporate layout imposed on them.design goal is to provide more flexibility and a finer granularity in corporation and alliance governance, and give players the freedom to decide how they want to organize and rule their own groups, as opposed to ccp guessing from the top-down ""what's best for them"".a bit more in wiki"

1/1/2010,"i know it sounds like a weird setup but how about evetv... a in game loop broadcast made by corporations, bidding on network time, commercials, etc.so and so corp gather the funds from 10-15 other corps, thus giving them commercial time in the time they have bought to broadcast. the only problem i can see is language both its misuse, and the barriers between the languages many of the players speak. but seeing a caldari news report, followed by a gallente sitcom, with a minmitar how its made, and a amarr 3 am religious broadcast, all in game using some kind of looped video would be... well awesome. perhaps the times could be bought with isk but the shows would have to be reviewed before showing.i am sure this would be a pretty good isk sink and a way of expanding the universe as well as giving some of our more creative types a chance to make their shows.

1/1/2010,"an excellent idea. i would like to add that i think billboards would be better attached to stations in such a way they are visible at the undock point, and should display the above proposed ticker, purely for immersion's sake.indeed, for immersion's sake, i would suggest that constellation chat become the new ""main channel"" for local interaction between players, in support of your idea that the local channel itself ""announces"" spikes in player traffic, and further suggest renaming the local channel based on sov, eg; amarr space gets the amarr certified news (""acn local"") channel, gallente gets ""scope local"" etc, and in 0.0 it changes to ""unaffiliated"" or somesuch."

1/1/2010,"and still we do not address the problem, only attempt to avoid the issue.the problem: a chat channel is a core source of information on pvp activities -- not tools in the game that require skills to use, simply a chat channel's functionality. this detailed information is available from no other source in the game. if it's going to be adjusted, then fix the channel so it works consistently and remove the pvp info to ""proper"" sources instead of ""tweaked"" to ""resolve"" certain issues by exacerbating a faulty implementation. simply adding complexity for complexities sake is rarely a decent solution and that's what is done when you expand inconsistencies and inappropriate uses in this fashion. ""don't use tools -- watch the chat channel!"" -- bunk.chat channels should be for chat, not for pvp intel and definitely not look and act different in different areas. that alone can mess with newer players migrating between the various types of space. my recommendation: make this a priority review for ccp and drop it squarely in their lap to fix. adjust whatever tools need adjusting to smooth out game play and provide equivalent intel but get this ""chat channel"" used for chat and *not* as most are accustomed to using it -- ""who's out there?!?!""another way of looking at it: i find nothing advantageous in making highsec seem preferable to low/nullsec and having this functionality ""adds value"" to staying there vs moving into the rest of the game. less impediments to player migration are superior solutions instead of more excuses to stay there."
1/1/2010,"""how do i make money in agony?personal money will be up to you to make and agony pilots are expected to be self sufficient. however, agony members often go mission running together or ratting in 0.0. in addition, if you want to mine on your own or with some other members, go for it. living in 0.0 offers great opportunities to make money in any way you see fit. but be warned that we often live in hostile areas where we are usually outnumbered, which can make ratting/mining next to impossible. one of the hardest things our lower-skilled new players have to deal with is making isk.""=>>that's a quote from agony recruitment. you will find this or something similar in most recruitments threads across eve universe. as you see as it stands even with local you admit how hard is for new players to self sustain themselfs , yet you propse things that will only make it hard - next to imposibile even for older players. and yet it's a requierment for recruitment. not only in your corps/allianceses but in most. 0.0 have nothing for the player that wants to have isk to self suport himself that cannot be obtained in empire. some could argue now that empire income should be nerfed. well if both those changes are implemented userbase will go straight down. i hope we dont need to argue here right ? it will have a huge impact on efficiency. and as i see it now: more isk -> more ships to buy more ships to blow up -> more engagements less isk -> more cautious approach to pvp -> less engagementsno misconception there. i just hope my words were not wrongly understood. you are doing exceptinally well with the t1 that you fly. you emply advanced tactics and win in many situations where odds seem against you. and i do know that you fly all typs of ships available. just you most often fly t1 ships. that's fine w me.but your proposal favors this type of play and only it. when proposing somthing with so deep implications in eve's universe you should as a csm rep think much wider. even tho you were voted by only some you now represent us all. i dont expect you not to be biased but i expect to try and see the big picture. not a fan of ninja ratting with cloak , and i guess most people arent. not much isk being made that way either. as it is now covops are a requierment for a good fleet. with this proposal they will just be a requierment point. as falcons were someday not so long ago we'll all play covops online :dtrue , and i admit i misread // what i read was removing all the local with no ship count at all. having a ship count will indeed help in pvp. but i still think it will have a nagative impact on pvp itself. if anything longer waiting times for scouts to do their job will ruin game for ppl with limited time. and scan button grinding will soon wore off any novelty and joy of the new system. and btw can you picture how conversations on intel channels will be ? there will either be too little info or too much."
1/1/2010,as far as chat being a tool in intel my opinion that the minimum intel it provides is both needed and not overpowering. all the other tools available make intel gathering for a simple task as having an overview of the numbers enemy have extreemly clumbersome. picture trying to figure if a fleet that's not on scan ( probes or scanner ) is blue or not. i will for obvious reasons pass asking in local. it involves either sharing info about fleets in intel channel with everyone either leaving allies in complete darkness.and last argument for now is that it's a game focused on combat. having intel/need for intel is great. but main activity is pew pew. anything that leads to less pew pew and more ideling ( even if that's for gathering intel ) is bad. will make alot of players depending on some intel freaks that might find a hobby in gathering intel for a while but they can quit any time in doing so. as it is now there's a place for everyone and if you are keen on flying a covop there's a definitive place for you and in fact a constant demand. making this a de-facto necesity breaks balance.
1/1/2010,"i would venture a guess that ""full local"" prevents many more fights than it enables. in fact i'm certain of it.the biggest problem i have with ""full local"" is that it makes space feel small. even in a 220+ au wide system like 9-2, you can instantly see who and how many are in system. tactically, it barely matters what system you're in. eve is already sadly deficient in environmental variety, and full local is a big part of the problem.delayed local would definitely change the nature of pvp in 0.0. i believe that if we can muster the courage to let go of the sugar-teat of instant system-wide intel, that we will have a hugely more exciting game. full local enables blobs. delayed local empowers small, fast moving gangs. full local benefits large alliances. delayed local helps smaller groups. full local makes scouting a job for a cloaked at. delayed local makes scouting a job for a skilled player.full local makes 0.0 boring and predictable. delayed local would make 0.0 exciting and dangerous."
1/1/2010,":shameless bump: guys - wake up - it's a good idea. a much needed idea. watchlist is at best a pain to re-edit when someone joins in or drops from fleet. either it's a new scout or tackler you want to keep alive, the cap chain while flying logistics or a new anchor in the rr bs fleet, you need a way to get them watchlists up and running fast.support this and you will."

1/1/2010,i do not have the time to read this entire thread but i agree there are many issues with fw that need fixed. i personally believe there is one thing that they can do to fix a lot of the standing issues which can be very simple to do.make the militia basically a npc alliance. and have it so that regardless of the enemy standings (which ever side they are on) faction fleet trigger or how ever you want to word it.example: gallente fw pilot enters amarr highsec has high amarr standings and does not get attacked by faction navy (current mechanics. but if the make the militia more like a allaince and have navy respond to all war targets then the above would be that pilot enters the as before but this time gets attacked by faction navy.but of course then he would just warp off and log off and the faction navy will stop going after the pilot and the pilot would just re-log and have freedom from being attacked by the faction navy since under the current mechanics the navy does not respond to war targets logging into a system only entering the system. this is as by design not a bug or exploit and supported by the gms' (direct representatives of ccp)by making the militias' more of a alliance and making it so that the npc navy attack all wt regardless of the targets standings it would solve many of the standing issues with both the plexs and pilots entering enemy high sec systems where they have high standing and not being attacked. it would also help with the plexing standing issue. also by doing this it would make the individual corps that are in fw be more part of the militia in general by allowing other militia pilots and corps to support them while they are being war dec'ed by the big alliances. it would make it so that if a none fw corp/ alliance wants to war dec a fw corp they would have to war dec the militia as a alliance (the faction navy not getting involved in such matters). this would also allow other members of the militia to support thier comrades in arms. which in my opinion should be possable but is not under current mech of the game. the militia would not be able to claim any sov since they would be a npc alliance.the other option to the wardecing issue would be to make it so a fw pilot being killed weather in a wardec or not give a faction hit to the pilot(s) killing the fw pilot.that is all for now 2 year old keeps trying to climb in my lap to play with the computer and she is stinky so i have to go for now.

1/1/2010,"it needs work because:the icon is small, and warp scram is the single most important thing in eve after guns.there is no way to know if you are scrammed or disrupted. if i have two targets with points on me, but one of them is disrupted, their is no way for me to know which one i need to kill to get my mwd working.their is no way of knowing how many points i have on me. the target could have a single point on me, or could have 16, both visual effects and notifications will be the same. that needs work.honestly, same goes for other types of e-war as well, but warp scramming is the single most important one. so i suggest, say, warp scramming icon next to your propulsion ui (the one where you set your speed), that appears when you are scrammed. and if you put mouse over it, it says who is scramming you and for how many points. also, i suggest that on the overview, when you put your mouse over the e-war icons, it says how0much e-war is on you. for example x3 means he has put 3 webbers on me."

1/1/2010,"freighters are one of the cornerstone ships in eve, but they lack any type of versatility and thus are extremely dull. making freighter pilots have some choice in changing ships attributes could make freighters a bit more interesting but will not remove their intended role or change their survivability.adding rigs slots to freighters and jump freighters would allow changing some stats of freighters, for example adding more cargo capacity at expanse of hp, or increasing warp speed, even increasing hp.note: this change requires other capital ships ""packaged size"" attribute to be increased to 1.3 million m3."
1/1/2010,"i would disagree: allowing fittings (rigs) onto freighters will pretty much lead to only one thing; cargo expansion, which is certainly not needed.yes, of course they could increase the 'packaged' size of capitals to prevent them from being hauled into highsec, but honestly freighters carry more than enough already. courier packages have also been increased in size with dominion addressing (somewhat) the problem of moving rigged ships around.what i would like to see, however, is the ability to carry more than just general freight cans with cargo. or the ability to put smaller cans into general freight cans.likewise i would like to see freighters/jf/orcas made far more nimble... waiting 3-5 minutes undocking from a station just to get aligned is mind numbing. or, if not more nimble, then just plain faster so that if i do choose to autopilot it does not necessitate going to work/asleep/get laid while you wait for it to arrive five jumps away (tho the getting laid part is fun)."
1/1/2010,"as a miner i agree to some sort of change along these lines, mining should be interactive so that the people who do it as their full time occupation both get something to do and have the bots/afk miner competition removed.i have noticed many of the people who say no to such suggestion follow their no with ""i like to mine while i read talk etc""... for a full blown profession this should not be the case. i never hear anyone go, while i pvp i like to read, watch a movie, study.i know it will receive alot of hate from people who either macro, alt, or only mine some of the time because they find it boring etc, but honestly removing these people from the pool of miners will do nothing but make our profession more profitable, more fun, and more necessary instead of a pass time.in fact it may lead to there being more miners since it will not be looked down on as a boring profession."

1/2/2010,"sorry but this ignorant blanket approach is more deserving of mockery as it does not address what is actually wrong with caldari ...ie. in some cases it is the missiles (read roflkets) and in others it is not, it's the ships themselves, in other cases still there is no problem and here is the main issue with this idiotic suggestion.if implemented this idea would make at least 2 stupidly overpowered ships, the drake and the cerb. most likely to the point that everyone and his dog would be flying them. a fully skilled ham drake doing full (around 660) dps with explosive or em damage whilst sporting around an 80k ehp tank is ridiculous. they are already very very good while using kinetic, this would be far too good.so something would have to give to compensate for this very hi pure dps. perhaps a quantity of shield recharge should be stripped from the drake to compensate for the new and improved damage stats ?how does that sit with ""racial flavor"" aspirations ? in short, leave the drake and the cerb alone, they are fine, they are better than fine, they're bloody good how they are and stupid suggestions like this will just result in them losing something else when everyone sees how unbalanced they've become."

1/2/2010,well put.
1/2/2010,"well yes, but i gave you a motivation. at the end of the day it resolves into cash for cpp. the issue is this: is the cash from people like me > the cost of the plex ghost r&d buys? i would say it doesn't make any difference. people who ghost r&d for plex to fund a second or third account probably won't purchase the gtc any other way if ghost training was removed. on the other hand, people like me who return and pay for 3 accounts for 6 months with real <U+FFFD> may not reinstate their accounts if there's nothing to get vaguely excited about returning for.none of us here know what the answer is. i'm guessing some accounts were lost due to ghost training being removed, i.e. people didn't return who would have if they'd have been sitting on the sofa, bored, watching tv one sunday afternoon and suddenly remembered they had carrier v to play with (not that it makes a difference of course, but you know what i mean). i suppose the ghost r&d thing is more ""live"", because people actually use it to fund their game-time, which isn't really the case for ghost training. so in a way i can easily see the case for ghost training being in, but ghost r&d being out is double edged."
1/2/2010,i and my currently active 5 accounts that could vote do not support this idea. it is far too late for that action as i have invested way too mutch time grinding up all those accounts to r&d levels.
1/2/2010,so which of the pro datacore farming voices an alt of awesome possum?
1/2/2010,"my problem with the proposal is that it fails to differentiate between people who take breaks from the game and farmers/rmters (real money traders). you can look at it as a balance between offering incentives for players to return to the game and preventing isk spammer.com from datacore farming for profit.i'd love to see the introduction of a ghosting fee whereby you can pay a minimal charge (5 euros or thereabouts) to have all passive activities continue while you are not playing the game. this would be a better response than the knee jerk 'remove all ghosting' ideas in this thread because:- the rl cost would outweigh the isk benefits for farmers.- players who take breaks from eve can purchase an incentive to return.- you are still paying to play but remove the opposite scenario whereby if i want to continue ghost activities while abroad for work then i have to pay full price without having access to the game.the nature of eve requires people to play the game for years to build up their character, so from a customer retention point of view it makes sense to give people a reason to return when they want to take a break for a few months.most players experience the burnout of ctas at silly o'clock in the morning or simply get bored of hauling pos fuel etc and one of the smartest things about eve was the way it let you step away from the game but left an incentive to return once your appetite for pod goo had returned.by all means remove ghosting from the game but please be smart about it rather than destroying the unique way eve lets us dip in and out of the game world, even when we have real lives to lead.edit - started an alternative proposal here"
1/2/2010,"what of blueprint research, capital construction jobs, market orders, and contracts. do these not continue and earn income for an inactive account, and directly compete with players who are still active?can't support something which seems only to the benfit of some players, like yourself, who seek to eliminate their competition in the name of fairness."
1/2/2010,the answer to that should be obvious.if your not paying and your account goes inactive... aside from obvious if not potential cool down (like 24 hours or something) everything and i mean everything should be suspended. (and yes i know its not as simple as that but the point is still valid)it doesn't make sense nor is it fair to us who pay for our accounts (even with plex's) that we should suffer from a damned ghost exploitation.i don't care if you use it as a tool or if your taking a break... we can't take breaks from paying our bills... neither should you.don't like it? tough... no one said eve was easy to begin with... put your back into it and learn what hard work is for a change... you can prob afford to buy plex's for all the business you do anyway. (you being said ghost/farmers and not to anyone directly in this proposal)
1/2/2010,"support fully....inactive acounts should have all ""activities"" suspended"
1/2/2010,"i think you're missing the point. while the initial proposal was only for ghost datacore production, i, and several others here, have pushed the idea of stopping all activities from an inactive account.for example when an account goes inactive:1. all market orders are immediately expired. at the next downtime, the goods from those orders are returned to the character's hangar as normal with expired orders.2. all blueprint research jobs are canceled. the blueprint is thus returned to the hangar it started in, and the slot will free up on its own, as per normal when a job is cancelled.these are just some examples, but the idea that these activities must continue for some reason is ludicrous, especially when the game already has logic to cancel the activities in an orderly fashion."
1/2/2010,"i like the idea but i would also like an attack priority for drones aswell. ie no point having ogre 2's try and chase down an interceptor. something like ignore frigates, ignore cruisers type thing. id also like there to be a way to set the range the drones orbit the target as well. closer for more dps but can be smartbombed, further away reduced damage but smartbombs ineffective."

1/2/2010,great idea!
1/2/2010,"i'm not opposed to the hp just coming in full, but if for whatever reason ccp opposes this, persistence across session changes(for some reasonable period of time) would be an adequate substitute. in any case, some manner of fix is needed."
1/2/2010,supported.
1/2/2010,"the bolded part is the key. in pvp, the enemy will quickly chew trough your ehp, and the few extra hp recharged thanks to the bonus won't even come close to extending your survival time as much as a straight hp boost with no extra recharge would. as an example, a raven with 3 lse ii, 2 invul ii and 3 cdfe has a 119 dps passive tank with 124k ehp. mr. all level v increase the passive tank by 12 to 131 and max ehp to 134k. with 400 dps incomming (extremely low even in a 1v1) and assuming that you get max recharge all the time (which you in fact doesn't even get close to, recharge in the 0-20 and 50-100% or so range is alooot lower) it would last 476 seconds with the ehp boost, but without the recharge boost, compared 460 seconds if it's the other way around. any increase in dps from there increase the difference even more. for example, in a 20v20 close range bs fight, the raven should expect atleast 15k dps if the hostiles have low skills, which the buffer one can take for 9 seconds, while the regen one dies in 8.34, hardly better at all then the base 8.33 it would get without bonuses (having both bonuses clock in at 9.01)...and again, that's assuming the recharge stays the same the whole way, which is not even close to true.ehm, passive tanks would hardly be effected at all since passive tanks require recharge speed mods to be effective, so they'd get that shield in no time anyway. passive tanks are for pve though, and in pve you're usually solo and not getting bonuses anyway.in any kind of pvp, i'd want my main tanking layer to be completely filled at all times. that means i'd be calling for reps as soon as it takes damage. that in turn means that it never gets close to peak recharge, and getting a fraction of the tiny boost that the bonus gives is extremely insignificant.but buffer tanks are used in situations where you know incomming dps will be so high that any amount you can rep will be insigificant and the only thing that matter is to delay the inevitable so that your friends stand a chance.no. i want to get my shield boost, just like armour tankers get theirs. they get +10/+15% to all standard armour attributes. i want +10/15% to all standard shield attributes aswell. the fact that high ehp=some passive tank is a shield tanking perk in general, not specific to the gang bonus. the bonus is supposed to boost every natural part of the tank, and recharge is natural for shields."

1/2/2010,"support.i like that function in halo3, and i would like it in eve"
1/2/2010,"relevant thread in features section: issue with planetssummary: while new visuals for planets are awesome it is sad to see that when one does 'show info' on them you can find some quite immersion breaking numbers. for example several planets that are by the backstory dense populations have temperatures or atmospheric pressure that is not suitable for life as we know it. one can also find for example gas giants that are far too light and far too close to their parent stars to be that or ice planets in so tight orbits around their parent stars that the 'ice' should have melting temperatures of lead to remain solid. so the proposal is to poke at ccp a bit to get some better planetary models implemented before planetary interaction arrives. i'm not asking it to be 'let's do phd on it' kind of complex and 'correct', but some kind of complex enough model that takes into account a bit more than just calculating surfce temperature of planet as if it has no atmosphere and then deciding it's atmospheric pressure entirely by random number generator. for example something like stargen modified to better suit the eve universe. it would be especially awesome if same model would be applied also to moons."

1/2/2010,"i support an overhaul of corporation roles, it needs lots of work on the ui making it more user friendly as well as adding more roles and being more adjustable to the needs of the corporation. now it is often either too much or too little, things like spending limits on wallets, limitations to grantable wallet divisions, as well as setting limits on the number of 'transactions' that can occur in a time period (24hr, 48hr, week, etc). it is silly that so many roles are weak in their customization and security for a 'corporation'."
1/2/2010,very much supported
1/2/2010,"i agree with this wholeheartedly, in fact i posted an idea similar to this in one of my omnibus postsidea omnibus #2, idea #1if you want more background as to why the role system is the way it is now, it was discussed a little bit in this thread, in four words ""64 bit role flag""supported"

1/2/2010,"you just quoted something that supports my argument 0.0 is dangerous so we encourage our members to take precautions. the self sufficiency thing is purely there to make it clear that agony as a corp won't be supplying free ships.and with the proposed compromise of local showing a count but without the free character intel it wouldn't change the difficulty in most situations. local goes up you bug out.that argument would hold water if people with billions of isk were throwing their ships around 0.0 with wild abandon. that is certainly not something we see on a daily basis. the majority of fleets we see pvping in 0.0 are in either 5-20 person light gangs or 50-100+ blobs. people are already risk adverse even when flying fully insured battleships (for example). but this leads on to the whole point of changing local which is to make it more likely to get a fight in the first place.case in point, we have a fleet on a gate and put a scout into the next system.before our scout has even come out of black screen session change he has appeared in local and anyone there knows his corp/alliance and even corp history.if they have a scout in our system (or any system along the route) then without having to do anything more than look at local they know how many people we have.at this point based only on free intel from local they will leave the system the scout entered and we get no fight at all.the two points are1) a single scout/alt in a system can tell the size of a fleet moving through it without having to lay eyes on it (either via being on grid at a gate or via the ship scanner). just local and clicking on a few portraits.2) people get intel on somebody new in system before that person has even finished session change and thus get a head start on their next move.except that once again you are under the incorrect assumption that we mostly fly cheap t1 ships i'm not going to waste my time responding to you if you continue with this claim that i'm only supporting t1 ship pvp.i didn't raise the proposal, but i am looking at the big picture.you claim this proposal is aimed at stopping easy isk in 0.0 so you have to fly t1 in pvp. that is utter rubbish.the idea is to open up more tactics in 0.0 but you are blind to that"
1/2/2010,"what you are saying is that without the ability to know exactly who is in system you can't pvp? it is true that without a hostile force there isn't anything to shoot at, but you shouldn't have the safety net when encountering a small gang of knowing that they have reinforcements in system unless you spotted them first.this kind of rubbish is what encourages hot drops and even login traps. i don't support people using login traps (and agony don't do them) but it does highlight the problem full local creates in getting a fight...why should you know if anyone in system isn't blue to you without having to take some action?it amuses me you talk about eve being all about pvp then bring up blues and allies which are more great ways to remove opportunities for fights in 0.0 and an attempt to make it safe somebody else who sees the bigger picture. i agree with this 100%.there will always be resistance to change.making black op drops more viable is certainly something i support."

1/2/2010,"if you caused it to self-destruct then you accomplished what you were looking to do. stop playing killboards online, because this isn't that game. and as griefer pirates love to spew to carebears, stop worrying about pixels (a killmail on a board) and just play the game."

1/2/2010,yes.
1/2/2010,"i think this proposal is a great example of the old metaphor about cutting off your nose to spite your face. trying to harm rmters by banning legitimate sales of characters is like trying to harm rum-runners by banning legitimate sales of alcohol. how well do prohibitions of things people want ever work out? one of the things ccp has done with this game that is genuinely intelligent is to cut the legs out from under the ebay crowd by letting you trade cash for items and characters in a way that does not let anyone try to earn a profit off of their game. people are going to buy these things, whether you allow it or not. banning it won't stop it from happening, it'll just force more people into using sketchier means of it that leave them open to scams, and help rmters. yes, sometimes people steal an account and sell the characters. obviously, this is a problem that ought to be dealt with. but trying to ban character sales because they are occasionally used wrongly is a ****** ate sugar argument. it's absurd on its face. this won't do what you're trying to do, it'll just inconvenience a lot of people who have done nothing wrong, and help the people you're trying to hurt. this is a bad idea."

1/2/2010,"yeah i said it.with dominion, getting a foothold against a coalition member is impossible, no matter how far away his coalition friends are. guerrilla warfare? give me a break. all endgame pvp comes down to is who has more friends. this would be fine and dandy if the game supported this by fixing the node issues, but with the game as it is, gargantuan blobs(system breaking blobs) just aren't fun.imo you should get benefits by attacking from multiple fronts and using the element of surprise(just like real warfare), but with all the rf timers, you and your enemy have way too much time to gather all your friends together to have one giant lag party. this imo is one of the major drawbacks of eve, even moreso with dominion.with dominion, the dreadful 2 massive powerblocs system is what 0.0 spaceholding is focused on. by giving both sides way too much time to travel to their friend's region before any real foothold is gotten. this should change.guerrilla warfare should have room in eve, not just giant honorable lagfests. us lost the vietnam war due to smart tactical decisions utilizing guerrilla warfare. why can't this happen in eve?"
1/2/2010,"in vietnam, the guerilla tactics were aimed at smallish groups of guys in the jungle, not at major base complexes or american cities. every time the north vietnamese tried to take on the equivalent of an outpost/major system belonging to the americans, they got pulverized. why should it be any different here? a guerilla force cannot fight a set-piece battle, and any conquest of a major piece of real estate(like an outpost or tcu) is going to be a set-piece battle. if you want to fight a guerilla war, gank miners and ratters."
1/2/2010,"i suggest you read up on the vietnam war, then.that said, i'm not saying to get rid of reinforce timers altogether. just cut them down, so you can get a small foothold so that by the time far-away reinforcement troops from the coalition arrive, they have a tough job ahead for them, and not just one day of fighting. something more resembling the way the game was before dominion."
1/2/2010,supporting this. truncating decimals is a terrible way of doing it.
1/2/2010,"of all the things i'd like the csm to talk to ccp about in the hopes of getting it done i wouldn't waste any of these people's time with this, there are a dozen things i personally don't care about i'd rather see addressed over this."
1/2/2010,they have three days. this would take two minutes. seems worth it to avoid confusing the newbies.
1/2/2010,"does that really matter? i mean, seriously. even if you don't see the decimal it's still applied and doesn't offer any benefits if made visible other than to brag you've got another .92."
1/2/2010,"when i start a new game, especially one as poorly documented as eve still is, i try to figure out how it all ticks. now i personally had friends who were already playing when i started, so i didn't have to figure out the skill training system for myself. if i had been doing it solo though, i know it would have driven me up the wall. none of my math would have worked, and i'd have been rather frustrated by the whole affair. yes, it's minor. yes, it's a small change. but it would be beneficial - not everyone thinks the same way you do."
1/2/2010,"i do agree that freighters should not be given rig slots, but i do however think they need a warp speed increase (.7 au/s on a 110+ au warp)"

1/2/2010,simple complaint:freighter bouncing off of gates... :( flying sideways at 1000m/s for 20km is not fun when you have to realign & reapproach for the next five+ minutes.
1/2/2010,"noif we added rigs to freighters, cargo rigs would bring freighter cargo holds over 1,000,000m<U+FFFD>, which will lead to people being able to move packaged cap ships through and/or into high sec.---edit grammorzzz"
1/2/2010,"i'd like to see modifications to the freighters as well, but i don't think the addition of rigs is necessary. implants can achieve some of the same results. i would like to see the addition of a ship hanger to the freighter to haul rigged ships."
1/2/2010,"versatility for a freighter pilot is provided by the fact that the freighter pilot is also a transport ship, hauler, and jump freighter pilot. i see no reason to mess up a perfectly reasonable ship class just to let people fly the same boring ship with slightly different stats. i don't support this."
1/2/2010,i like the idea.id like a slide bar or a tick box that would allow me to change the freighter from cargo space to ship maintenance for moving rigged ships around.
1/2/2010,freighters are balanced just fine. no need to change them.
1/2/2010,"easy soloution: nerf cargo and boost armour just enough so that a full rack of cargo optimizers gives the same stats as today (and atleast personally, i hardly ever come even close to filling my obelisk, so i'd much rather fit agility and warp speed rigs).however, i don't think it's a big deal. i wouldn't mind if it got implemented, but i won't be holding my breath for it either."
1/2/2010,as warp speed rigs are percentage based those are rather useless.same as warp speed implants (hy-[012]). agility might be something. but isn't that why we have webbing frigates?
1/2/2010,"they're not supposed to be versatile, silly."
1/2/2010,"a freighter is designed to be just that, a huge box with thrusters that you throw all your crap in to move it.adding rig slots opens up the possibility for all sorts of new game breaking mechanics, such as cargo expansion rigs that take the hold volume above 1,000,000m3, allowing them to haul certain capital ships.it'd cause more issues than solutions and the holds on freighters are large enough as they are."
1/2/2010,y is everyone hung up on caps? just put a popup about it violating the convention that regulated wars. as for cargo i'm left making multiple runs daily to get the ore and produced goods to market. allowing some customization would not unbalance the game.
1/2/2010,not supporting... i'm a jf pilot and even i see this as a major problem.the only thing i would suggest as a buff is to allow freighters to transport ships that are rigged... you may not be able to pack as much as you want...but it would solve alot of problems.and possible the allowance of packing containers other than gfc as i've realized its a real pain in the @$$ (except the secure cans for obvious reasons...but your generic cargo can... fer crying out loud?!).
1/2/2010,"a simple proposal.tl; dr: the csm should propose to ccp that it should increase the visibility of the keylogging threat and act against it. how should this be done? simple: 1) high-density placement of warnings about the danger of having your account stolen, not on the website but in game, probably on log in or on the character select screen. 2) a sub-committee, preferably of csm members or trustworthy members of the community with good computing skills, is set up to review freeware programs with the facility to guard against keyloggers and suggest the optimal one to encourage everyone to get. 3) ccp will create an optional ""pin"" system for logging into the game: - mr. worried logs into eve and hears about the keylogging threat. - mr. worried creates a pin by a button on his character selection screen. he is presented with a standard 0-9 keypad with the numbers on each randomized so that there is no way to record what pin he is entering. the numbers are randomised on each pin entry which can only be done via mouse-clicks. - mr. worried re-logs into eve. to access his character select screen, he must reinput his pin onto the randomised keypad. this pin system will guard against most common keyloggers, and is a system already present in at least one other mmorpg."

1/2/2010,"if you think mining is boring and needs a more interactive boost, you should do something else in the game. mining is boring, pvp is not, other things are somewhere inbetween, pve/invention etc. there are plenty of things in eve to do if you get bored or burnt out on something try something different, it isn't rocket science to change career paths if you don't like what you are doing."
1/2/2010,"classic... if you think mining is boring then you should pvp. instead of actually throwing in some useful information or making a vote. mining is a profession, unless your a pirate pvp is a passtime or a necessity because of pirates."
1/2/2010,they are actually looking into a new system for mining called planetary ring mining as well as comet mining. they talked about it last fanfest. here were the highlights:planetary ring mining-scan down veins of rare ore-new resources-more engaging and interactive-rediscover that goldrush feeling-player skill and intuition counts! (which is bad news for the macro miners)comet mining-scan them down-richer comets in w-space-they contain organic compunds-possibly alternative release valve to moon goo-scoop up their ejaculate!
1/2/2010,"i like the idea of interactive so i'll support it.but i would like to see it this way:you lock on to a roid and start your strip/mining laser.a random mini (10 sec) ""vein lock"" game now starts,after the game is over the mining starts.when the mining starts a new ""vein yield"" game starts, now you can choose to play this game for more yield (50-100%)or go reading,watching tv,playing on 2nd account or keep an eye on local but not getting the extra yield.this way:1. macro mining becomes impossible. 2. all afk miners can stil do there thing.3. active/main profession miners get more fun/yield/iskthis way everyone wins"
1/2/2010,"way to troll, because all the words strung together making sentences expressing thoughts in my post there just said 'go pvp' clever how i did that. the posts below yours actually address the issue as have other posts, including my original one. fantastic that the only way to make the one thing you do, mine, 'fun' is to change it because it is so boring to you who loves it so much, 'i love you but can you stop being so much like...well you?'.i have no problem if a solution to your and the op's problem is to make other ways of mining as a post under your comment mentions plans of ccp's or something similiar but as i originally stated making me do more 'work' for the same reward is stupid and not supported. when i read people talking about mini games and puzzles with mining i get these nasty thoughts about the intelligence of these people and feel they should quit eve and load up minesweeper or maybe just open a new window to do that. somehow doing anything 'extra' that ccp doesn't make to entertain you while you do this boring thing you love is really wrong and if they came up with a way to entertain you more while you do the thing you love so much then it would be okay, sounds kind of silly to me.to reiterate there are lots of things in eve to do, if you find mining boring or tiresome etc try, try, try something else, there are many other so called 'professions' that you can do, actually there are lots of activities but people like to call them professions for some reason."
1/2/2010,"hello,please forgive me if there was a similar topic, but i think that i stumbled upon something great :dmy idea is that mining could have new improvement - mining platforms. at this point many people cry that miners get rich while playing the game afk (away from keyboard). so this new feature could be a step in a right direction.in my opinion mining platforms could be mobile, anchor able items. that takes a lot of cargo hold and can be anchored only in a hauler (maybe something like 10-27k m3). at this point mining platform should offer greater yield than hulks (or other effects), because other way they won't be used. so at this point it should have factors that would force miners to pay attention while operating these mining platforms (maybe some anchoring times, changing target times and etc).the paying attention thing would be that these mining platforms would use subsystems (just saying what the game has). these subsystems would decide on these mining platforms effects. also they should use 1 crystal at the time (like core crystal). it would decide on yield and would take time to change, so you should pick your asteroids with that in mind. also mining platforms should have addable modules like miners, shield improvements, cargo expanding and etc (these modules would be decided by used subsystems). sorry, got carried away abit, but the attention thing would be enforced by that that these platforms would use fuel (there would be platforms for each race with different bonuses and use racial pos fuel (only ice products)). also it would use cooling liquid to cool lasers (there is such thing in eve items, just don't know how to spell it). also people would operate these platforms from their ship which should be 1.5 or 2.5 km from it. it would have some interface where person should look on readings and press some buttons accordingly. for example, when temperature reaches certain amount he must order cooling liquid to be used. maybe some critical situations could be implemented (some asteroids could be harder, lasers could break, if systems aren't cooled when needed some subsystems/modules could micro explode, losing it's bonuses till it heats too much and the platform explodes itself). when i say readings i mean more than 2 or 3 things to watch and react accordingly. maybe you would have to increase/reduce reactors power to some of the lasers (some would require more power if they would be better or harder).about the modules in it, they should be able to improve the yield, cargo hold, shields, armor and etc. my idea is that these mining platforms wouldn't have big cargo hold and that it would require hauling the minerals out of it. of course you could make the cargo hold bigger by sacrificing some shields or yield or something. maybe these platforms could have cloaks while you haul it. but they shouldnt have pos type shields because belts aren't your property :) maybe you could operate or unanchor it by typing in a password. maybe in low sec people could try to hack the locks.due to my offered subsystem way, this could be t3 of mining.as this would be totally new thing, it would let's say require new category of skills - ""platform operation"". what can you know, if thought right you could make more platforms. how about platform shops? where people can approach and look at your items? (viliasas ng drug store )in the end i just would like to say, that this would be a great thing if implemented right and it would be really cool (:d i want it) if it would be implemented. i probably didn't covered all of it as i have trouble expressing my thoughts, but it would be more like pos guns where people man them and they get it's bonuses. these items should be manned all the time and should disappear after dt if left. just thought about shop platforms and they should be thought about differently :) who wants to lose its items if forgotten after dt."
1/2/2010,reserved.p.s. in my opinion the main idea is good. my offered implementation? probably not so good. but i think you have your own minds to comment on what's bad or good and how could it be changed.

1/2/2010,"sounds like something that is oriented towards corporations more than single miners. the idea is nice, but i don't see how that would really be practical. a mining fleet with an orca is already a force to be reckoned with, this adds more complexity and logistics for (as far as i can see) nothing that would make it more interesting.i think a mining structure of some kind could be useful, but i don't see any implementation that would really make sense just now..."
1/2/2010,"as i thought about this, i had it in mind as for single player. not corporation or alliance. if this structure would offer greater rewards for single players, it might be used."
1/2/2010,tech 2 orca perhaps? (what would that be? humpback whale? 8) )but no... not supporting.mining profession as a general rule of thumb is not supposed to be an uber solo gig... it starts out as a solo job... but only works if you have a cooperative (or more than one alt/account) to do the job proper.mining should only be profitable when your doing so in a team situation... not solo.if it was a solo job then it would be all to easy to go npc and mine the crap out of everything and empty entire systems of belts... no way... not ever.
1/2/2010,"proposal:introduce a cheap subscription that allows passive activities to continue while you are away from the game.suggested cost 5 euros.perceived problem:passive activities such as skill training, market orders, agent rp and research jobs are damaging to the game if they continue on unsubbed accounts because it encourages isk farming and aggravates some paying customers.on the other hand eve is a long term hobby and ghosting is an important aspect of the game to many of us who like to take breaks away and reinvigorate our lust for pod goo, the trend towards removing ghosting from the game decreases the incentive to resubscribe after a couple of months away.suggested implementation:if you have not bought a sub then all activities related to your character would stop, a server side file would be attached to your account to record any market orders, research jobs, etc.on resubscribing your orders would be placed back on the the market and any research jobs would automatically que up in the the shortest available slot. skill training and rp collection would resume.if you have bought ghost a sub then you would not be able to log in to the game but your account would ghost in the same way as before ghost training was removed and you'd have access to the forums, the ghost sub could be upgraded to a full sub at any point."

1/2/2010,if you had bothered to read up on previous attempts to change the policy on this particular subject you wouldn't have bothered to even try.if you continue to pay for your subscription... no one is to stop you from taking a break aside form changing skills... it's that simple.don't pay... it should be suspended..ccp has already gone over this... it's not my fault your refusing to read what's put in front of you.so either your trolling... or your blindly posting proposals that have been refused many times before.would be nice if i could take a break from my electrical bill for hours at a time.... would be nice to take a break from my car payments or my loan payments.wow gee golly wiz... welcome to the real world.eve online has enough problems with people cutting corners and not putting in a valid hard work effort short of the isk farming that's going on... we don't need it to be any worse.what you ask for may be valid but in reality people will make new accounts.. queue them up and then abuse the system to hell and back... ccp shut it off for that very reason.

1/3/2010,"not the issue being discussed, and the problem with this is if you forget to change payment methods or otherwise fund your account be it a day or several before you can pay ccp, everything you had going on gets 'canceled'. make a mistake, get wrapped up in real life issues and congratulations we cancelled all your orders, research, manufacturing etc, welcome back. to me that is stupid, you pay for market orders, you pay for research/manufacturing jobs anything you pay for should continue until completion or the account is removed by ccp, not ludicrous at all to me.research points are not something you pay for directly like any of the above, you train some skills build up standing and say let's work on something, then you are given rp throughout the day over and over till you cash them in or stop your research with the agent. while i disagree with the removal of ghost training(on principle) it is done, getting something for nothing (direct pay) is what ccp said they don't offer (ninja edited but still) so removing the collection of rp on inactive accounts when you turn them back on is a logical step along with the ghost training nerf. i support this idea because it works with the system of no gain for no pay on inactive accounts, which is what rp collection and skill progress on unpaid accounts are, market orders and research are paid for with isk and set to end by their nature."
1/3/2010,yes... lets take my words out of context.de -that... is what i'm getting at.

1/3/2010,"this part was supposed to be posted right after the one above, but seems like the forum ate it..a straight up hp boost with nerfed recharge time to balance out the increased hp in regards to hp recharged/sec would indeed be alot better, even though both should be given imo due to what i wrote right above this.no. recharge is not a natural feature of armour like it is for shields, so making it give an un-natural bonus should require specialized mods, aka wafrare links. however, it is indeed very insignificant, so i don't care much either way,ehp is indeed not the same as hp, but it scales with it. ehp = how much damage you can absorb without having to resort to repairing in any way. your definition of ""regen and repair rate is also ehp as they are also hp that the incoming dps has to defeat"" is pretty much unique. hugo summed it up very well:"
1/3/2010,"passive tanking shield ships will receive the bonus to shield regeneration making their tank heavier, exceptionally heavier on some ships.active tanking shield ships will simply boost the 2-15% of missing shields.armor tanking ships cannot regenerate armor, which is why their armor is added passively without reducing the current amount. until you want to give armor bonus two upsides, as the shield bonus has (perhaps a 1-7.5% resistance modifier?), this is not a reasonable approach.(basically, shields get regeneration and max shields, armor just gets max armor)"
1/3/2010,"it seems to me that the ""correct"" solution has already been pointed out -- make the bonuses persist in some way between sessions.how about this as a proposal: when the shield level is greater than 100%, the shield should decay towards 100% at the current shield recharge rate rather than disappearing instantaneously.i suggest leaving shield reset on docking as it is."

1/3/2010,agreed. just abandon the character sales. screw you people that sell and buy chars to amass your isk in game. some of us earn it by playing the game. rmt via char transfers will do serious harm. much more so than character transfers been dragged ( underground ) as someone said. simple thing is this. so many people are only trading chars etc simply because ccp is making it so damn easy & legal to do.
1/3/2010,"outright stopping character sales would be a doubtful move and i'm unsure of the exact implications.but nonetheless, something needs to be done."
1/3/2010,supported
1/3/2010,"thank you for the support.far too many people are being struck down with scams, hacking, banning with no justification and character rip-off schemes."
1/3/2010,you can find some discussion about this in the minutes of today's csm meeting as soon as they're posted. we didn't have the material or time to formulate an all-in solution but we will be taking this to ccp.
1/3/2010,"i propose to introduce a universal rank system for eve, which applies to all pilots flying for a npc corporation.the ranks will be distributed along the certificates achieved by a pilot (although those are not flawless, they are good enough for that), with a point value of 1 point for a basic certificate 2 points for a standard certificate 4 points for an improved certificate 8 points for an elite certificatein total, a maximum point value of 887 points can be achieved, when having acquired all certificates in game (a higher ranking certificates nullifies the point value of its prequel).there will be 10 ranks for pilots, which will be more civilian labeled than the faction war ranks, to stipulate the mostly industrial character of pilots flying for npc corporations. trainee pilot -> 0 - 20 points junior pilot -> 21 - 60 points (2.37% of max point value) regular pilot -> 61 - 120 points (6.88% of max point value) senior pilot -> 121 - 200 points (13.64% of max point value) expert pilot -> 201 - 300 points (22.66% of max point value) adept pilot -> 301 - 420 points (33.93% of max point value) master pilot -> 421 - 560 points (47.96% of max point value) elder pilot -> 561 - 720 points (63.25% of max point value) sage pilot -> 721 - 886 points (81.29% of max point value) omniscient pilot -> 887 points (100,00% of max point value)there is a progression in the limits to get promoted, resulting in quicker promotions at the beginning of a pilots career and a considerable slowing down at the higher ranks. the leading value ist the percentage of the maximally achievable point value, to allow for adaptions in the course of possible future changes of the certificate system, however, a rank once achieved should not be taken away again because of a system change.the classification of ranks can be justified as described below:trainee pilot (cadet level)a young pilot having just left the pod pilot school with his first few certificates, on the way to achieve the first follow-up certificates to fly small ships and use the respective modules, weaponry and rigs for it reasonably well.junior pilot, regular pilot, senior pilot (commissioned officer level)pilots generally reasonably to well specialised on a certain role as trader, miner and refiner, inventor and producer, explorer or fighting pilot, or aspiring generalist pilots starting to build up their broad education.expert pilot, adept pilot, master pilot (staff officer level)pilots with a broad knowledge of skills and trades and being able to fly a wide range of ships and operating their modules, weaponry and rigs good to very well. also, specialised pilots to a few distinguished trades with excellent to superb command of all ships and skills to master their professions.elder pilot, sage pilot, omniscient pilot (admirality level)pilots with not only a very broad education and being able to fly nearly all ships of all races including operating their modules, weaponry and rigs very well to superb, but also mastering all industrial trades very well and up to perfection.the ranks should be automatically assigned to a pilot in a npc corporation after having been assigned the certification and the point value calculated. an option for the pilot to switch on and off the rank as being displayed on his character info should be offered.ceos of player corporations can simply adapt to this system and thus achieve a guideline on how to create a rank system for their corporation, although they obviously do not need to stick to the rank lables at all and can invent their own."
1/3/2010,"no.certificates are useless.just like certificates, this is another useless arbitrary ranking system.it serves no purpose."
1/3/2010,"i have stated that the certificate system is not perfect, but it is not that bad and gives acceptable guidelines of what to train.the rank system gives some more sense and meaning to the certificate system, motivates to become proficient in one or more skillsets and mini-professions, and offers goals and acknowledgment for being reasonably well trained for something.it could be fun for many, help some, and won't hurt anybody."
1/3/2010,"please can a mechanic be inputted to allow the following:you set a corporation/alliance blue and check an option. when blue corporation/alliance gets/sends a war dec the opposing corporation/alliance becomes set red for the duration of the war unless you set them red globally via the standings page.a simple yet effective tool for those of us who enjoy having empire wars but use neutral alts to gather intel...which is pretty much every empire war corporation/alliance, including griefers, mercenaries.this also spans to being able to see your friends have been dec'd without being informed by said friends.thoughts? adjustments? trolls? can you think of any ways that it can be exploited? p.s as you can see i am in privateers so this mechanic would be incredibly useful considering at the moment we have 14 wars going at the moment"

1/3/2010,"it's a simple thing to not allow for cargo expansion. wouldn't it make sense to be able to customize your freighter with better agility or higher warp speed or whatever and not be able to increase your cargo capacity? freighters are already optimized for cargo so they simply can't be optimized further.i think it would be a great improvement of the game for all freighter pilots, even when they say they don't support it."
1/3/2010,"not supported.is that a platinum-insured nyx i see in jita ? hint: courier contractsyes, some means of partitioning cargo beyond courier packages and gfcs would be useful for a lot of pilots. a giant secure freight container might also be useful (one can already expand freighter cargo via courier contracts containing hundreds of loaded gscs, but this is extremely tedious)."

1/4/2010,"no what youbve just agreed to is that your argument is based upon the misapprehension that bonuses and balance can be applied in eve online without taking the ship-to-ship balance into account.basically what your doing is saying you want your ships balancing without any actual recourse to the game you want them balancing on. shophistic principles are bull**** smoke and mirror tactics. your either a very persistant troll or you genuinly fail to understand the game your playing.as an aside admitting to being a sophist, if you are aware of the words meaning or context, is basically admitting to being a liar; and a very poor one at that."
1/4/2010,not supported. op's logic and proposal are flawed.
1/4/2010,at least he has logic not like you.
1/4/2010,"the ""blanket approach"" as you call it is not deserving of mockery.the ""racial bonus"" nature of the hull damage mod on cmb's is not equivelent in strength to the hull damage mods recived by gun boats.being generous to the conversion and assuming that kin is the optimal ammo for 1/3rds of encounters means that a 25% kin only bonus ( at lvl 5 ) is equivelent to a 8% rof or dpl bonus ( at level 5 ).of course gun boat hull damage bonuses run at 5% meaning that at lvl 5 a gun boats damage bonus will be 3 times stronger in actual usage than a cmb's bonus if the cmb pilot uses optimal ammo.all arguments about rainbow damage bonuses being op went flying out the window with the dominion revision of mini ammo.drake and cerb may be close to top of there class if they got proper damage bonuses but would not be op.double rainbow damage bonused sac is not considered op by the player base , in fact it is one of the least flown ships in eve.short range set ups in use still tend to be ac and blaster boats.and a cerb would still lose out to the ishtar with its massive 10% per level damage to whatever flavour it wants to do damage bonuses + room for neut / nos.also i think your numbers are bs 660dps & 80kehp at the same time ? since when could damage moded ham drakes fit a tank ?i know for a fact you have left of any propulsion mods or tackle to get close to that number a problem a passive / resisted ac cane wouldnt have.2 weapons systems are based on damage switching ( missiles and proj )2 weapons systems are based on range ( hybrids and lasers )3 weapon systems get 25% damage bonus ( 5% per level rof|dpl ) those being hybrid/laser/proj ( proj being close to rainbow )1 weapon system gets 8% damage bonus ( 5% kin only equiv of 1.6% per level rof|dpl ) that being missiles.changing kin only to rof|dpl would only bring missile bonuses up to the same level of guns.it is mathematically impossible for the game to be balanced as it is.either cmb's are balanced verus equiv gun boats at pilot lvl 1, or they are balanced at lvl 5 they can not be balanced at both because of the disparity in the stregth of the bonuses.does a cane|ruppy|rifter pilot lose 25% of his dps when he switches from fusion to emp ? ( exp > em )answer no , does he fck. < good bonuses that are compatible with tactics.does a drake|cara|kessie pilot lose 25% of his dps when he switches from kin to emanswe yes he does. < ****e bonuses that are not compatible with tactics."
1/4/2010,"you don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about. this thread is worse than the contents of my toilet on new year's day. urgh. fyi, its 83k ehp and 658 dps with a 3% pg implant, or 642 dps without.blanket boost are lazy and stupid. the af afterburner bonus on sisi proved this. some ships have issues, fix them on a case-by-case basis. the ""problem"" missile boats will not be fixed by giving them multispectral damage, and the good missile boats do not need boosting. it will not fix the nh's awful pg, nor the hookbill's terrible cpu, nor the sac's poor range and awkward slot layout. and the multispectral damage of the raven doesn't alter the silly cpu requirements of shield rr mods."
1/4/2010,i'd really like to see this eft fit.blanket boosts are not stupid when they address blanket problems.racial bonuses are not equiv of rof|dpl bonuses no matter the hull.
1/4/2010,"it's the bog standard ham drake fit, man. don't talk about game balance issues until you know how to fit a ship."
1/4/2010,"omg. arent you guys bring the drake defense speach up too often? it is a good caldari ship ,i would say one of the very few caldari ships worth using for pvp, but bringing it up every time in a caldari topic is a little bit boring.so caldari ships should be crap because they have the drake?why arent you compare the caracal vs like vexor or ? wait that would clearly show how flawled the caracal is.or hawk vs anything worst ship in eve.or the phoenix worst dread.or a nighthawk worst combat commandship for pvp.or crow worst ceptor and kestrel what i havent flown in ages.wait all of those are crap compared to the other races ships in the same type. coincidence? lets see what is so similar in them , oh wait the kinetic only bonus,what a shame...the raven+its variants are only good for pve because they dont have the stupid kinetic only bonus.same with the rook.but the drake ...."
1/4/2010,"firstly, by your early posts in this thread we see you dont want the ships your whining about comparing to other ships, so talk of tackling is moot, as is talk of propsulions mods. secondly the racial boost is equal to rof and dps bonuses when the end effect results in balance in the game called eve online. now on paper (which, i would like you to note, is not eve online) you *might* be considered right by some people. unfortunately were playing eve online, so your not.without using the cerb's kin bonus on the below fit, (skills lvl5) i end up with 756 dps with t1 non-kinetic ammo and 78114 ehp tank with regen tank of about 255. high's: 5x t2 hams.mid's: 1x invul ii, 1x photon scattering field ii, 3x lse iilow's: 3x pds ii, 1x bcs iinow. i am about to do something that might irritate you; im going to compare this with a similar outfit on a muninn (close range (ac's) dps with high ehp tank; hardener plugging lowest resist and eanm instead of em/invul shield hardener). what i get is 904 dps and 49838 ehp with no regen or active tank of any sort.well how odd....the cerb looks like it would win...but wait, i forgot you didnt want it comparing to other ships, oh silly me"
1/4/2010,what are you talking about 756dps for a cerb how? your whole post makes no sense..
1/4/2010,"ahahaahahahahahahahaha.....hilarious...ahahahahahahahahahha....oh the drake, wont someone please think of the drake!!!"
1/4/2010,"the problems of the ships that you quote are nothing to do with the kin-only bonus. you are barking up the wrong tree, putting 1 + 1 together and getting 3.caracal needs a bit more pg really, but it's basically alright solo and in gang.hawk - cpu and roflkets.phoenix - missile flight time in fleet.nighthawk - too little pg (btw astarte is worst).crow - roflkets.kestrel - roflkets.fiddling with kinetic-only bonuses will do nothing to fix these problems. it will not enable the nh to fit a gang mod without multiple fitting mods, it will not enable the hawk to get a worthwhile sml fit on or give it the dual-web that its roflkets need, nor will it make citadel missiles hit instantly, nor does having multispectral damage make the raven viable as a shield rr bs. the drake and cerb are top-notch ships even with their kinetic-only bonus, while the multispectral sacrilege is close to worthless. this kinetic-only issue is a smokescreen blinding you to the true problems.are you interested in taking the time to analyse and fix broken ships and produce a balanced game? or are you just interested in a simplistic nozh-style blurf change that makes your eft numbers look better but doesn't actually fix these ships' problems?"
1/4/2010,"oh god yes! also, 2 lows kinda sucks needs 3-4 tbh - but that's really the fault of the tier system.doesn't need a lot - definitely less than 150 grid.-liang"
1/4/2010,"about fixing crappy ships question is not how but when. i dont care realy much how ccp will fix them until they will be balanced, oh and different than the rest :p"
1/4/2010,stop talking rubbish. do you even know what dps means ?
1/4/2010,"damage per shot/second/salvo; depending upon who your talking to.you asked for a fit that could do what the other guy said. i provided one that could, then provided another ship similarly fitted but without the ""nerfed"" bonus that couldnt beat it in combat.funny thing is, i just proved you wrong, much like many others in this thread have, and you respond with insults. pretty standard response from someone who doesnt think things through when whining about how much their ships suck eh?"
1/4/2010,"wrong wrong and more wrong.point. caracal being alright solo and gang.people outside of caldari militia ( new caldari specced players ) do not fly cara'scruisers in use in game atm are predominantley ( ruppy / vexor / thorax ) in that order.point. hawk. rainbow rockets are not roflkets. hawk fixed.point. phoneix. rainbow cit torps would give phoneix good usage againt pos , still crap verus other dreads for cap fights but meh.point. nighthawk would have respectable damage if rainbow even fitting a rcu. fixed.point. crow. rainbow rockets are not roflkets. fixed.point. kestrel. rainbow lights are not lololights. fixed.

1/4/2010,"i think that's going too far. you did, after all, accumulate the rp's with an active account. that would be like saying if your acount goes inactive we zero out your isk."

1/4/2010,"i like this, it seems like a nice simple solution to getting greater control over your drones (although i'd still like a whole drone ai module where i could write whole programs for them)but realistically, this has my support."
1/4/2010,"every shield-buffered pvper in the game would gladly trade the ludicrously tiny increased recharge from the shield hp ganglink/skills away for the instant addition of the bonus hp. every single one. and every shield tanking pve-er will have a booster fit, so they don't actually have a problem.if giving up the extra hp/s recharge is what it takes to convince people here (who have obviously never really flown a shield-buffered ship in pvp - pro tip: we're not talking about purger drakes, people!) that the bonus hp should be added instantly, then that's what the csm should consider submitting.absolutely supported - with or without a proportional recharge penalty, this is a simple tweak that fixes a big balance disparity.persistence of all bonuses between sessions would be nicer, of course, but that sounds significantly more technically complex."
1/4/2010,"thank you everyone for the discussion, i will raise this issue for the next csm meeting on the 17th."
1/4/2010,"supported.i'd also like a ceo option for the corp logo to be displayed alongside the alliance logo.however, the player should be able to disable the display of both logo's in his client."
1/4/2010,"i also believe that this would be in ccp's interrest in terms of getting more players, and more player satisfaction.one of the things that make my hairs stand, is watching awesome eve videos (wish evetube came back)videos for recruitment, videos to show how awesome our game really is, videos that make people feel as part of the eve community!"
1/4/2010,hehe. it's not whining as i quite like the new visuals. it just would be added awesome if the new skins would be glued into locations where they make sense. unlike current 'temperate earthlike' skins 60 au from sun like parent stars with surface temperatures low enough to have atmospheric gases in solid forms.
1/4/2010,"op had a perfectly valid point. i don't mind our ships breaking elementary laws of physics as much, but planets should at least roughly stick to them."
1/4/2010,"supported.there are planets in the game classed as temperate with surface temperatures of only a few kelvin.that's cold enough to make even geordies say ""it's a bit nippy."""
1/4/2010,"well, maybe it is time for ccp to get a phd and fix planets stats and some items descriptions. also, maybe it is time to get rid of marines that weigh one ton each, i know they would get big muscly guys into the army, but their should be a limit. anyway, it looks absolutely ridiculous when you have 3 first planets ice ones, then you have a gas giant and like 2 lava planets, and then a temperate world. does not make any sense. *stares at another temperate world with gravity of 5g, covered with oceans and with temperature of 77 kelvins.*so yes, maybe let's get a phd for him to check that all the stuff devs put in actually makes a slightest bit of sense."

1/4/2010,"1 360 degree max range directional scanner and they know if there are ppl within, how much was it again? au. the ones docked up are invisible then, and the ones at a pos were already untargetable, so for them nothing changes (well, it'd be less safe to undock, esp. if your outpost spits you out), and some of the clutter is removed from the list (the docked ones).i'd say the attacker knows which ships are with him (if he isn't solo), not in the least as those are the ones showing a range (after gatecloak) or not at all (during the gatecloak), so for him nothing changes for the worse, he even gets less clutter as the docked ones are gone so half of the useless targets disappear.all he has to do is warp to the belts and seek the unfortunate souls that didn't spam the grind often enough. even the upgraded systems are not difficult, as instead of on right-click menu the sites appear at the click of a button in a window.as for the ratter/miner/whatever, even if they spam the grind often enough, they have no way of knowing who is there, could be blue as well as red. the attacker can attack everyone on scan, the defender has no way of knowing if he should warp to safety or not. and if you have to warp out every time someone enters the system you cannot mine or rat very much..."
1/4/2010,"who has more to fear from the menu; the customer, or the cow?you want a replacement intel source? how about good old fashion hard work?""risk vs reward"" and all that.if you want to know that your space is safe, then get out there and patrol it.d-scan, combat probes, gate guards, roving patrols of belts/planets/moons...""the only safe place in eve is docked inside a station""."
1/4/2010,"maybe a limited form of the map search option that shows people in space in the last 30 minutes could work to replace it. remove local, but add a directional scan which covers systemwide. however all it does is show the amount of people in system, and has maybe a 3 minute cycle time.this way you can see spikes in population to prepare for larger scale ops, or small boosts for lowsec pirates. you wont see name, corp, etc...also, we have sentry drones, why not sentry probes? short range, passive modules you can set to tell when a ship crosses a small sector of space. they can blare an alarm when incoming ships warp in to the region. the plus is that you can scan sentry probes easily, so its both more risk and more reaction. if you want local gone, you need to give limited point-defense or point-scanning tools to help."
1/4/2010,"ooh... there's an idea.sentry would have a limited radius, so you have to post it close to where you want to monitor. meaning a watched gate is quite obviously a watched gate. and if anyone triggers it, the response is immediate.but also give them realistic targeting and scanning. it has to get a lock, and then identify the ship, before it can report more. so if a covops sneaks through your gate, cloaking immediately, the sentry can't report anything more than ""contact at the gate"". whereas a fleet coming through would report more like ""selrid miamarr - abaddon , marcus gideon - dominix , chribba - hulk ..."""
1/4/2010,"i strongly approve of this idea :-). i would however like to add the idea of being able to split the stacks as formentioned, but also being able to have say 2 stacks of 15% and 3 of 11of 5% ect. this would allow adjustments for players with inferiour skills/ minor roles. and would enable the orca/ hualer to not have to keep trac if an even split is not desired."

1/4/2010,what if the bounty just logs off for an entire week?
1/4/2010,"more relevantly, what happens if the bounty accepts the contract with an alt, and then kills himself in a shuttle? it's not a bad plan, but it's not nearly complete enough to be taken forward. step back, think through all the problems(maybe with some friends/random forumers helping), and then take it up again."
1/4/2010,"the payout would be the default insurance value of the ship destroyed to avoid this possible exploit. this is deducted from the payout (if any) received by the destroyed target.this financial approach will prompt bounties to avoid being hunted down and shot for any reason, even if it's in nothing more than a shuttle.this continues until the entire bounty has been acquired.to avoid exploitive use of alt-podding a useless clone the maximum payout for a pod kill is the value of updating the clone (deducted from the bounty, not the pilot)."
1/4/2010,"now this is what i meant by random forumers making it a more complete proposal. this makes the proposal work far better, and even if there are holes(hacs should pay out more than 3 mil), it still makes this thread dramatically better."
1/4/2010,"yes, that is in fact a good improvement. i want to initiate something that true bounty hunting will become possible in this universe, and if others contribute to a system which allows such, even the better.i'll add this payout scheme as proposed by mister xerox to my proposal."
1/4/2010,"this would stop the pirate to kill other innocents for a whole week. but i would not object to skip this requirement, or to lengthen the amount of time mentioned."
1/4/2010,"as there is already a bounty office, why not allow players to go and pick up the 'contract' from the bounty office, much like a normal bounty hunter would do, this way the 'target' wouldnt know whether a contract has been taken out on him or who has taken that contract.it would also allow a multiple people to hunt the same target leading to competition within the profession, the first one to get the pod kill and deliver the corpse to the nearest bounty office completes said contract.the contract would also act as a way to stop concord intervening, providing you are attacking the target on the contract. remote reps and others would still be subject to normal flagging mechanicson completion of the contract, all other bounty hunters that have taken a contract on that target are informed by eve mail to say the contract has been fulfilled, to prevent them wasting time."
1/4/2010,"so, the bounty hunter would get 40% baseprice per ship killed, until the entire bounty's collected?to collect a 10 mil bounty on someone who flies only frigates for the duration of the bounty, i'd need to get around 100 kills?if there are 5 contracts out on a target, could i accept all 5? would i get 200% baseprice per kill?as target, could i keep an alt around to shoot at me once the hunter comes, and have it take part of the bounty?"
1/4/2010,"with your permission i would like to raise this issue in the next csm meeting on the 17th.however, it will have to be a relatively unspecific proposal, along the lines of 'may ccp in all its wisdom introduce drone implants and rigs [y]/[n]', with the caveat that its impossible for us to decide on specific attributes and slots without spending a gazillion hours discussing it, thus leaving much for ccp to decide."

1/4/2010,remove all the module effects except rr. use dev resources to fix broken 0.0.

1/4/2010,"we have a rig that gives +10% to powergrid. let's have a rig that boosts cpu. should we? their are alot of ships that lack cpu, mainly the small ships. your opinions?ps: ovcource we could place some very powerfull drawback if we need one, one of them could be cutting power grid."
1/4/2010,"i know we discussed this a bit in-game, but i'll say my piece here too. i don't like it. it'd be hard to balance, and it'd cut off a huge number of other cool rigs that you could build instead(say, the cpu use for guns rigs, if they ever made them useful). i'd rather that we make the more specific cpu rigs useful instead of trying to make new generic ones. not a terrible idea, but i can't support it."
1/4/2010,"simply put, remove any ability to set any standings at all. everyone is simply either blue (in your alliance), green (in your corp) or neutral. bye, bye to the 1000 vs. 1000 in one system garbage (ultra-blob warfare). small alliances will actually have a chance to get into 0.0 without being forced to nap either team a or team b.roaming in small gangs is viable again amongst other things that are deeply missed in the old days of eve.so before you rage flame this idea, just take a couple minutes to think about how the dynamics of 0.0 / low sec / empire would be like and if it would be better or worse than what we are experiencing now.side note:what would 0.0 be like during the first week?after a month?6 months??p.s. - faction warfare, well, not sure about how that would fit in but it would not get any worse for sure."
1/4/2010,who would be able to stop bob then:d
1/4/2010,"as i understand it everyone is neutral to begin with and it is up to you to manipulate the standings. when you go to war they become red, when they become allies they become blue. whether you adjust the neutrals to either side is up to you.once treaties are released (which got nudged out of dominion) i think the more complicated bits of standings with alliances should be eased at least in part."
1/4/2010,"this is a fundamentally dumb plan, and it will continue to be fundamentally dumb no matter how many people propose it. you can't stop people from having friends just by making the ui even less functional than it already is. you'll just make people memorize corp tickers, and maybe push alliances to merge. you won't change gameplay, you'll just annoy the crap out of everyone. no."
1/4/2010,"didn't you and your boys laugh at my exact same proposal about 3 months ago?you are obviously so narrow sighted as to not realize how good what you just said is for destroying super blobs.memorizing corp tickers works o so well currently when something odd happens and standings aren't set or bugged. oh wait, that's right, people usually shoot first and then realize mistakes.merging alliances together wouldn't at all create political strife? oh wait it would because the power hungry want power. the reason for so many smaller grouping of alliances is because it seperates ideals into finer details under similar types of leadership. grouping those people together would create problems ultimately leading to breakoffs of that alliance that would ultimately create the same separation we see today. which leads back to standings **** ups.ultimately, this leads to people refusing to blue so many ****ing people and instead put bullets in each others heads because it's just way easier.back in the good old days before standings, nobody like being allied outside of an alliance because it created constant standings issues. many people choose either to stay away, or just form under one flag as a result. this lead to the wonderful leadership councils of fa, and stain, and ascn that worked out oh soo well. just ask those old players how much they loved 5 hr meetings of 50 corp heads trying to all ***** about how much a pound really weighs."
1/4/2010,"i think you misunderstood what i was getting at. i should probably revise my op a bit. if you did make a similar proposal link it. maybe its better than mine.bottom line is ccp can only do so much with hardware to free up lag and such. something else has got to give. would this idea really be game breaking? memorizing tickers? be realistic guys. something has got to change to get rid of this team a vs. team b only senario. eve would only get vastly more enjoyable if this happened. ""you can't stop people from becoming friends!"" forming a gang is nice.all in all it comes down to either you are on the overview or you are not. time to spice it up."
1/4/2010,"hey, i'm not an idiot. i know this will make stuff harder to run - probably not as much harder as you're suggesting, since i'd like to think that people can learn from the mistakes of their predecessors, but harder. to put it bluntly, though, what effect it will have is secondary to me. eve's user interface is frigging awful, and you're proposing to make it even worse. am i the only one who thinks that's insane? you're trying to social engineer fifty thousand people by means of making this game even harder to play. you keep doing stuff like this, and you'll succeed at making blobs smaller, because people will quit playing instead of taking the **** you're trying to shovel onto them. you've commanded big blobs before - what would your opinion have been if ccp's solution to big blobs was to eliminate the ability to warp between gang members, or to run gang warps? i hear that'd make big fleet movement next to impossible - that'd mean smaller blobs, right? or how about it checks your computer to see if you have a voice chat program running, and logs you out of eve if you do? what you're proposing is less invasive, but no less terrible an idea. you are trying to make the game harder to play for the specific purpose of forcing people not to play the way that they want. what sort of bizarro world game design philosophy is that?"
1/4/2010,"i guess you guys are referring to stuff that i was not all to familiar with from years ago that were issues resulting from there being no standings feature in the game. granted some of these issues could apply now but the game has changed dramatically since then.if removing standings would create more problems then how about using the same model of war dec fees and introduce them to standings. the more alliances/corps you blue with, the more expensive it becomes? of course there would be that whole only shoot red people but maybe that aspect of standings could be changed.fixing the lag will not fix the current problem of ultra-power blocks in 0.0 nap train a vs. nap train b is just dumb. it does not allow any other alliances to enter 0.0 without joining either side. ccp and the csm acknowledged that and dominion was supposed to fix that. from what is happening, nothing has changed."
1/4/2010,"i highly doubt removing the standing list would solve it, it would just put more work on the diplomats of the big blocks. they still would bring the same numbers.the chance was that the new sov system would lower this a bit, but i think allow to anchor the tcu next to a deathstar pos isnt really helping the cause.maybe we should disallow this?"
1/4/2010,"why not change the game so that anyone not in your corp/alliance gets automatically targetted, and the guns start to fire unless you manually stop them by entering a random 20 digit code?that would prevent any ""nap-fest"" pretty good, no?i know i don't know that many multiplayer games, but i think eve must be the only one where it is declared to be a problem if people are not constantly hostile to each other."
1/4/2010,lawl no.
1/4/2010,"for some reason, and i have yet to figure out why, this is one of those ideas that instead of being refined and made better every time it gets posted, actually gets worse. it's like a really crappy wine that only get nastier the longer it sits in the barrel.even if you completely removed standings from the game, players would still use them. they'd just find another way to manage them. most likely some out of game website some intrepid pilot would throw together. then instead of checking for a colored icon in game, they'd have to toss a name into a search screen and get a kill/no kill order. this doesn't strike you as making the game less enjoyable?also, despite your apparent ""this only applies to nullsec people anyway"" approach, people in high sec do use standings as well.i can appreciate your frustration about the lag in nullsec, but this isn't the way to fix it. i'm not even sure it would help the way you think it would. i have a feeling it would make the blobs bigger, since people would want to make sure they're surrounded by people they can, if not trust, then at least feel comfortable they won't accidentally shoot them in the midst of a fight."
1/4/2010,as its already been pointed out... removing standings is a waste of time as it would result in more frustrating forms of communication and relations.just because someone is blue to me doesn't mean they can't shoot me or i can't shoot them.even then your likely going to get a ton of complaints and various whines over it... so this is a big fat troll imho.
1/4/2010,"*sigh*i guess no one likes the idea of a 0.0 without nap trains and laggy fleet fights. this particular stab at trying to fix that may not be a good idea but i don't see anyone else proposing anything besides, ""it's all ccp's fault! csm you need to intervene... somehow..."" emo threads."
1/4/2010,how many blues does tri have?
1/4/2010,"it has nothing to do with whether i like or dislike it, any more than my opinion regarding a dictatorship of the proletariat does. you can't get there from here. stop trying. spend your effort on something that can work - solutions like node reinforcement, general server code improvements, and placing a high priority on fixing bugs like the one leading to the recent lag. those will do much more for fleet fights than any sort of hare-brained scheme to balance the game by cranking up player annoyance. it'll work about as well as the attempts to balance pos sovereignty the same way - you won't stop the behaviour, you'll just make your most dedicated players despise you."
1/4/2010,"/supported!i too don't have a clue why some gellente ships have splitted weapon systems in turrets/missiles...besides eris, see lachesis too.."
1/4/2010,"hmm, i guess i see your point's, good thing i don't make games"
1/4/2010,random ideas should be in the suggestions forum.properly drafted proposals and issues should be in the assemble forum.
1/4/2010,"not supported.the reasons for empire dwelling go so far beyond simply making easy isk. isk is a means to allowing players to get what they want. remove the ability to make isk and you remove the ability for them to get what they want. that might be a t2 marauder, a pvp cruiser or skills that will see them improve their capabilities. at this point they might as well not play because eve is changing from a sandbox where you can do anything to forcing players to go where the minority want them to go.if you want people in your space, make it more desireable to operate in. that means making it safe from pirates and profitable at least. ccp can increase the spawns and rewards but at the end of they day they only control the basic mechanics. its the players the make the environment and if that environment is not attractive to people then that is the problem of players attitude and thus only players can solve it."
1/4/2010,want more people in lo sec? stop shooting them to extinction there. stop asking ccp for overpowered toys (infini-point ships). stop asking ccp to nerf carebear toys to uselessness (wcs). start doing your part in getting more people in there. ask your corp to protect your local systems from pirates instead of scaring the guests away.no? i didn't think so. carry on with your nerf crusade.
1/4/2010,"hictors are not overpowered - they're like hacs that deal half the damage. and wcs are not useless - on a hauler, their only drawback is that they take up a low slot. yeah, they're useless on a combat ship, but that's as it should be. i mean, op's idea is off-base, i think. i'm not disagreeing with your opposition of it. but please, use some arguments that make at least a little bit of sense."
1/4/2010,"then why not come up with a plan to stop the scammers and hackers, instead of ruining it for the legitimate 99%?"
1/4/2010,"don't forget that we find ourselves in a very privileged position, being able to trade characters and real money for in-game valuta. i am sure that i;m not the first to say that without these two mechanisms, eve would be a different and possibly better game."
1/4/2010,"you know... if you disagree with the proposed change, you shouldn't support it, even more so if you propose a different one"
1/4/2010,it's nice to see there's someone on the csm who's likeminded.
1/4/2010,"no, i'm sure you're not the first to say it. doesn't change the fact that i completely disagree, or the fact that ccp disagrees as well."
1/4/2010,"you only disagree with the last two words of my statement then.i always have and always be against the sillyness that is gtc->isk, and in that same way, isk->chars is exactly the same, namely buying your way into a game so that skill doesn't matter any more.i'm proud to say i'm a self made man, i own a titan, a mothership and four characters (three trained up from scratch) and i did all that without spending a single euro on anything other than subscription and a fanfest trip, and there are many people who are many times richer than i am because they are smarter or can spend more time. so the mechanisms aren't needed by any means, people do fine without them."
1/4/2010,amendments can be made before it's brought up. it's not like ccp or the csm make any decisions based off the exact wording of a request in a forum thread.
1/4/2010,"well yeah, i only disagree with the last two words, but that's the core of your statement. usd(or eur, if that's your thing) -> isk trade is brilliant - if it wasn't for the inevitability of abuse(macroing, exploits, etc.), i'd favour allowing unfettered two-way trade. i'd love to see a proper forex market in fictional currencies, it'd make my inner economist very happy. and yes, people can do without them. i've never bought isk(though i do sell it, i fund two accounts through plex), nor have i ever traded characters. most of the ultra-rich players i know are in the same boat with the exception of maybe the odd sale of an extraneous industry alt. but for people with more money than time, it's great. they can get what they need to play and outsource the grinding to some cultural studies major with more time than money. it's win-win, and instead of providing an incentive to macro, it cuts the knees out from under people who want to make a rl living by being an eve miner."
1/4/2010,i support this suggestion.
1/4/2010,"@ op - you are not very good at eve. actually, you're very bad at eve. i suggest you reconsider your subscription. being warp scrambled for 10 minutes and not noticing it on your overview doesn't mean that you should get a pop-up with a dismissal ""ok"" but"
1/4/2010,"i really don't see the point of this. i don't need a rating system based on the already-bad certificate system, i can just look at the api data of anyone i need a read on the skills of."
1/4/2010,attitude and experience beat any other arbitrary ranking system.
1/4/2010,the one thing this game does not need is another way for asshats to stroke their epeen.no.
1/4/2010,we don't need a rank system when we have killmails causing epeen-isms.ditch killmails and i'll support it.otherwise.. sorry...cert's are craptastic as it is when they miss various fields of professions like freighter pilots.
1/4/2010,"sorry, but this is a terrible idea.certificates are useless, and are taking up database space that would be far better used elsewhere. this will do the same."
1/4/2010,"well, looks like it is not liked by the audience here that pilots will be able to show off anything else but kill-mails to demonstrate any ingame achievement.we all know that this game lives from those who create isk and mine roids. they don't have kill-mails (except as showing up as victims). kill-mail creators don't create any worth in game, they only destroy it (what, on the other side, is as well crucial). but why those more civilian aligned pilots must be denied any official recognition of what they are doing good, is beyond me. i know and understand, and have it written already twice here, that certificates are not perfect. right now they are outright meaningless for most. with a system as proposed there will be more than a few pilots being motivated to pursue certificates and in effect will even profite from generally better skillsets.when certificates get more impact, value and meaning in the game, they even might be improved into something truly useful."
1/4/2010,"plenty of people are recognized for things that don't involve killmails. tripoli, entity, chribba, haargoth agamar, ricdic - could you even describe vaguely a kill involving any of them? because i can't. there's plenty of things to brag about - just because there's no explicit in-game mechanism to aid you in doing so(except the api, the forums, screenshots...) doesn't mean that it can't be done or that you can't get famous for it."

1/4/2010,i would prefer they do away with npcs altogether in plexes. plexes should be defended by the militia players. just let players know what plexes are being taken so they can do the work themselves.
1/4/2010,"i intend to join the faction wars sometime this year, and this issue should be solved by then!"
1/4/2010,"the real issue is minidding, aka how ccp took away the titan's aoe 71k smartbomb and put 56k of it into 7 stealth bombers. however, it takes a lot more effort and coordination to do a good bombing run than just hitting a button and killing everything on grid with pre-dominion titans. when a bombing run works it's so rewarding to the whole group because it does take a lot of preparation and skill. so, let's keep this feature. however, keeping it mostly means keeping it balanced, otherwise people will start whining about it and sbs will get nerfed to hell (and maybe lose this nice role).first of all-fix the issue of bombs not traveling 30km off after launched when it's laggy which results to dieing to your own bomb *this is a critical issue*then, the following-reduce bombs' aoe down to 10km-reduce bombs' velocity down to 1km/sec-increase bombs' travel time to 30sec-increase bombs' explosion radius up to 650m the idea is to make bombs slower and less powerful unless the target is painted.also, consider removing their ability to fit covops cloak when (if) the local window gets removed also.not by any chance do i consider these half-measures against minidds. remember, given the current bombs' hardened % in armor, perfect bombings can do up to 56k racial damage per wave which is a stunning amount of alpha damage even against battleship hulls. by making these changes you give a chance to the opposing side to counter, either by warping out or using smartbombs in a 5-6sec window or having a small signature. these changes will make bomb runs more difficult as bombs will have to land near the target and successive waves usually will be needed to take down battleships, thus making the game more balanced while preserving the fun role stealth bombers have now.i hope i've made a compelling argument."
1/4/2010,1. the lag issue is more general and doesnt need special fixing imho2. bombs are fine. spread out and stop blobbing. bombs are the perfect counter to big blobs of ships sitting close. making rr close range blobs much more vulnerable. which is good.3. smart bombs already work vs bombers. though again sitting in a big pile makes them hard to use.
1/4/2010,"smartbombs work if you can nail that 1-2sec window you get with current bomb velocity and smartbomb radius, which is pretty impossible to manage and coordinate. making bombs slower opens that window up to 5-6sec which actually makes it possible to actually time it and smartbomb the incoming bomb. bombs are *almost* fine, their 15km aoe radius makes bombing a gate the closest thing there is to pre-dominion titan dding which is completely unbalanced. that radius needs to go down to 10km. spreading out, as you suggested, doesn't help because of that radius. what you don't understand is that a smaller aoe radius makes bombs more deadly as the amount of overlapping 10km spheres decreases, thus decreasing the chances of losing a bomb to its own wave, thus increasing the amount of bombers that can simultaneously drop a bomb.it's not about the enemy spreading out, it's about you, the bomber gang spreading your bombs (which actually requires manual flying and true skill)."
1/4/2010,"bombs and bombers are just fine imo. they are a very necessary counter to rr bs. as you unintentionally point out in your post, their great power is balanced by requiring great player skill and by their extreme vulnerability.a 56k alpha should be easily resisted by any pvp bs.more t2 ships should be like bombers tbh.not supported."
1/4/2010,"3 waves of sharpnel can be resisted by your vanilla flavored explosive hardened rr tempest. maybe 4 if conditions/boni are ideal.you miss the point though. the point is to create a window of opportunity to escape a bombing run, or at least counter it. i'm not talking about the overall potential damage output of a bombing run. that still remains the same, 56k. very few bs can fit a smartbomb and a lrar without gimping their dps. claiming now that smartbombs are a viable tactic against a bombing run is clearly wrong. rr bs need to be at most 8400m apart (otherwise rring doesn't work) and can have a 6k t2 smartbomb range. both modules are really restricting on their own (not to mention smartbombing each other).all those figures i posted in the op need to be set to make this whole deal balanced. bombs need to be at least 10km off the rr bss, which still gives them a 4km opening where smartbombs won't save the rr bss.and consider again this: bombing a gate when whatever fleet just jumped is 100% equal to a pre-dominion dd. appearing 12km off the gate after the jump places you within the aoe radius of the bomb thus killing you before you even actually manage to hit your dcu and hardeners. if you don't see a clear imbalance in this 100% true scenario, i don't know what else could convince you."
1/4/2010,rr bs dont fit smartbombs.
1/4/2010,"so, you do understand you're supporting my argument by saying that rr bs don't fit smartbombs which actually strikes them out as a viable bomb countering tactic, right?did you actually read what i said about bombing a gate that has cloaked by the gate ships that just jumped in? or did you just decide to address to this issue only on the points you think you're right and forgetting all the rest?"
1/4/2010,not supporting...i fly them... don't see any of the problems that where outlined...and honestly.... this feels like its a nitpicker and not a buff...more of a nerf.especially if you remove covert ops.... seriously... do you even fly them?
1/4/2010,"bombers are the counter to rr bs, not the other way around. they're ""overpowered"" against unsupported rr blobs because that's what bombs are designed to do.i didn't answer your point about bombing gates to get inbound jumpers. i've never seen the tactic used, but i don't see anything wrong with it. given the maths, a 5km size gate (and i think they're bigger than that) has a spherical jump-in area of 2642km^2. a bomb will have a maximum intersection of ~706km^2 (actually more depending on the angle of the chord).you also get <10 seconds to see the bomb and gtfo, which is generally enough for any ship small enough to be one-shotted by the bomb. remember that small ships take a large reduction in damage due to sig radius.edit: and really, a gate is only one of several ways to get into a system.edit 2: anyone who knows my alliance knows that we do a lot of rr bs work. we've done some work analyzing bomber attacks and concluded that they're a threat, but not by any means an unbeatable one. the tools are already in the game: we view bombers as another factor on the battlefield which we can overcome by improving our fleet doctrine. i might add that nerfing stealth bombers would be a net benefit for us, since we're bombed far more than we bomb. but it's not a nerf that any of us believe is needed. in short: i know what i'm talking about."
1/4/2010,"bombers are fine, and your proposed changes range from unnecessary(explosion radius) to awful(removing the covops cloak). not supported."
1/4/2010,"overall premiseallow a system for players to consensual pvp, solo or in group. players can pick and choose fights by entering a cue. ship and isk loss is part of the action. the reward for participants is the ability to choose fights in high-sec. this can be a hot issue. the simple argument is that if you want pvp go find it in 0.0 or low-sc. join a pvp corp. or challenge someone in local in high-sec.why an arena: an arena implantation can allow players to learn pvp which benefits fleets, gangs and pvp corps. causal players can find casual pvp vs the time it takes to organize a fleet, roaming gang or other wise.another advantage is helping the market  more ship losses means more sales and increased need for supply. this affects the economic chain. implementationcreate a non-instanced solar-system that allows for consensual pvp. use the alliance tournament rule set with some modification. all participants can expect that if they loose, they loose their ship. allow players to be able to warp within the system but not jump out. jumping would cause the loss of the ship and the forfeiture of any match. do not allow for the creation of bookmarks in the system. players can warp but only to existing destinations. the system security should be set to .5. this allows players with marginal standings to enter the system and participate. the system(s) should be located away from major hubs and even located in the midst low-sec. adding travel to the risk. this can stimulate traffic into low-sec. putting it together.a player enters the pvp arena system. he docks at station. he sets himself up in a cue. the cues can vary  solo fights vs. group fights. limitations can be placed on ship types (cruiser vs cruiser for example) or limited player numbers (maybe a range players in a fight so you can have lopsided groupings?).players pay an isk fee to participate on a match. the larger the ship type the larger the fee. the fee is not refundable and lost. winners do not gain the fee back. player gets awarded a sigil for pvp once a match is established with another player(s). player leaves the station and warps to a spawned arena pvp beacon. the sigil in the player cargo has several affects:it allows the play to fly to the designated pvp beacon / locationit prevents them from being concorded when engaging the selected opponent.players cannot join or invite other players to gang. if the player is already in a gang with other members not without a sigil for the set fight, the player with the sigil is removed from the gang. the spawned pvp beacon is visible to all players in the system. betting and viewingother players should be allowed to observe and bet on matches. betting pools can be done at stations. observers can warp to a beacon and watch the action. players with bets on a particular match should have the option to warp to the combatants in the system (with a limited distance). players can only bet against other players (not an npc entity). so betting requires other participants.existing system destinationsstationsasteroid fields (low yield)arena pvp beacons arena pvp complex and bunkers players use the system to pvp and learn to pvp in different environs. players attempting to interfere (aggressing, shooting or even targeting) combatants should be concorded. this includes non-participants using remote rep."
1/4/2010,"gain and losswith all things eve there should be a gain and a loss. gain:winning a fight by destroying the other players ships, players should be rewarded with a small percentage of isk based on the total amount of winning bets. if their where no bets, the play does not get any isk.winning players would get a kill-mail. the kill mail will include an indication that the opposing ship was destroyed in an arena system. players betting on matches gain what ever the betting pool allocates. loss:participating players that loose, loose their ship. participants should take a standings hit for pvping in an arena system match. the standing hit should be small but overtime should have a cumulative affect. this is a consequence as being part of a less then desirable activity, as viewed by the more lawful large empires. poddingparticipants should be allowed to pod. podding another player should carry the same standings penalty awarded to players who pod others in high and low sec. bottom lineappeal to casual playerswould help stimulate the economywould allow players to test ship types and gang strategies.will encourage pvp not detract. the more experienced a player is at pvp the more likely they will fly out to low and null sec. encourages player interaction  through betting and direct competition.potential for establishing new professions  professional gladiators, bookees, etc allows players to utilize realistic pvp mechanics  will need to equip warp scrams and webifiers fro example. arguments againstmy guess is that fw was established as the compromise to an arena pvp system. fw provides goals and allows player to have direct interaction with other players. my guess is that the devs rejected an arena system with the following in mind:it goes against the sandbox premise of eveit has the potential to detract from pvp in low and null sec.it would require the creation of different game mechanics within a systemthe servers might have more stress if s system is flooded with pvpers in an arena. (though given the size of fleet fights or the number of people in jita, this seems less relevant. )players will become dependant on pvp in an arena and not venture into low and null sec. there is a desire and need in eve (for some) for this kind of system. with all things gaming, players always move on and never remain static in a system (ok, maybe not everyone). players that feel more confident in their pvp skills and have a better understanding of ship loss (or the experience of loosing your ship) are better equipped to experience different aspects of the eve universe. plus, this would be fun."
1/4/2010,"i have no objection to this system, but i'm not sure what it does that can't be done with existing tools. this sounds exactly like several player-run tournaments that already exist successfully. how much coder time would this take, and what would we get for it? i expect you'll do better just building support tools that can be used for more than just arenas, and letting players admin this sort of thing themselves."
1/4/2010,client run > player runhaving to depend on players to (a) run a tournament and (b) implement detracts from the purpose. having the client run the system allows for it to be available on demand.
1/4/2010,"1400 people in jita makes for a very unpleasant experience. the entry gates closing because of congestion. the station exits clogged with ships. the lag... oh the lag!0.0 pirates, curled up under the sheets, in fear of the dreaded ""cloaker"" who lurks in the shadows. he's staring at you from the local roster. he could be tucked away in a deep safe, his player actually gone downtown while their pc stays logged in. but... he could also be right behind you!!!you come home from a long day at the office. all you want to do, is log in and kill someone. but... there's 50,000 players online, and you have to wait in a queue. oh, the agony of waiting!now... how would you define ""playing"" a game?- is a market alt, sitting in a station, checking prices on various items... playing?- is a market alt, sitting in a station, completely unresponsive to anyone or anything... playing?- is a covert spy, floating 100km from the enemy pos, relaying info to corp/alliance chat... playing?- is a covert spy, slowly coasting towards the surface of the sun, completely unresponsive to anyone or anything... playing?so here's my idea.so long as a player is actively engaged with their client, they are ""playing"". if you have gone an hour or more, without changing course, activating a module, speaking in chat, or searching the market/contracts... you are ""afk"".when you have been ""afk"" for an hour, you are logged out to the character selection screen. there is nothing in the game that requires your presence, without your interaction. research/industry goes on whether you are logged in or not. and spying on something still requires regular updates.if a player has turned their machine on, only to have a menacing face in local, while they are at the office all day... they do not need to be taking up space on the server.sure, this could be countered by a bot. but ccp has already said that bots are illegal.if an afk timer were introduced, it would help to free up server resources, as well as help appease the fears and paranoia of null sec'ers everywhere.that face in local, the one that chased you under the skirts of your pos shield, has been staring at you for an hour. and then... its gone. did he leave the system? did he logoffski? or was he afk the whole time?"
1/4/2010,"a freighter on autopilot makes about one jump every five minutes. there's highsec routes 40-50 jumps long. that's four hours of non-interactive play, and i'll be very annoyed if i have to make some meaningless action every hour to stay logged in. similarly, there's plenty of times where i'll stay logged in solely to get chatlogs from channels i sit in while i'm out of my house. what's wrong with that? those are just two forms of afk gameplay your plan would ruin. i'm sure that there are others. not supported.edit: posted this, and then saw your sig was please visit your user settings to re-enable images.i lol'd."

1/4/2010,"in other words, he's not playing the game the way you think he should be. sorry, your atitude reveals volumes about your motivation.that aside, a quick google search revealed a circuit that, for about $40 in spare parts, can be plugged into a keyboard port and send keystrokes to the active window. so now the computer is playing eve without me! \o/no, wait...that's bad.my point is that unless you put in something horribly intrusive, you're never going to catch afk folks that are determined to be afk and in game at the same time."
1/4/2010,"1) 40-50 ap jumps is not playing, it's asking to get ganked. if nothing else, an afk timer would serve to save a foolish freighter pilot from themselves.2) recording chat logs for future reading... not even sure what that's about.everyone is welcome to play the game how they want to play it. but ""not playing"" is not playing.other mmos have afk timers, and they log you out after 10min of inactivity. i understand eve is much slower paced, and it's quite possible to go an hour with nothing to do. but you should at least check on your character in that hour. otherwise, you come back expecting to have completed a 40-50 jump trip, and instead find wreckage and a floating pod.yes, you could wire something up. or you could use one of the same bot programs farmers use to turn lasers on and off with proper timing. however, automation is illegal.so because it is possible to work around activity detection, does not mean that every single eve player will use those means to cheat. and if someone is suspected of using a bot to avoid going afk, they can be reported. then when ccp messages them to see if they're awake, and they get no response, they can ban them."
1/4/2010,not supported. someone correct me if i'm wrong here.. but i think the login servers are a separate set of servers that only process logins. meaning a login queue is a result of a lot of login/logout activity and has nothing to do with people already logged into the game.
1/4/2010,"well, that's his problem, isn't it? and btw, noon ganks an empty freighter for the hell of it. probably if he is autopiloting he knows his stuff isn't worth ganking. in general, i can see where you are coming from, but it's a bad idea, it just isn't gonna work."

1/4/2010,"okay now that i have everyones attention here goes. i suggest that ccp reduce meta 1 loot drops from rats by 10% per quarter. it will give us an idea of how much the market is, in fact, affected by reprocessed mission loot and not mineral compression mixed in with the current numbers. this would do two things, be a way to mine data on reprocessing and to see in just how many ways the market would be impacted by such a measure. what i would also like to see is more interactivity within eves economy. so much in eve is player produced, yet all of the meta 2-4 items have little player input  shoot something, oh i gotz a shiney now. i would, therefore, like to propose the introduction of damaged loot dropped by npcs, in the same quantities as now, of meta 2-4 items. basically, have a damaged module drop, which is .1m3 in size that has the same name as the actual module. for example, upon looting i find a damaged n-type explosive hardener. it would have the same randomness of dropping as the current module does; just now its in damaged form. when put into a production slot with the normal materials of a t1 explosive hardener plus blueprint, etc, you get an n-type explosive hardener. and for simplicities sake you can use the same icon only with a red corner to denote it being the damaged version. or another thread i saw somewhere else someone mentioned using them in a more noob friendly version of invention. or they can be used in a t3 like reverse engineering process. please help with furthering this idea into something simple and yet giving more player input into the game.please dont turn this thread into a remove all t1 loot or you dont get my vote because we dont know what that would do to the eve economy. and, oh yes, my main source of isk is running lvl 4s and i can get easily between 10k and 20k m3 of rat poop in a day. to put that in perspective, in about a month i have all the minerals i need to make an un-researched thanatos with un-researched component bpos. and the kicker, i use no ammo, orge iis, and pulses ftw."
1/4/2010,"please, learn the difference between meta 0 and meta 1 loot before posting this kind of idea:1) players can build only meta 0, not meta 1, so there is no meta 1 items used for compression. i suppose you mean meta 0 in your post;2) meta 1-4 items recycle for less minerals than meta 0;you idea, beside the use of more minerals to build the named (meta 1-4) modules (and that can be a positive characteristic, depend on your point of view) has a flaw: it will use a lot of build slots. seeing how it is not possible to rent a manufacturing slot on a pos and that the pos manufacturing capabilities are open only to the owning corp it mean we will suffer from a shortage of building slots.the net effect would be a overabundance of unused ""named item components"" and a sharp drop in non monetary mission rewards and at the same time we will find in market only the top named modules, probably at an increased price. essentially a new player unfriendly situation (no public production slots available without long queues, high cost of named modules)."

1/4/2010,"a passive omnidirectional scanner with range depending on the ship signature radius as part of overview? this doesn't really fill the same niche as local, and seems more like a variant on the directional scanner crammed into the overview.while i would not mind a directional scanner improvements such as you propose (adding tickers and a passive mode that updates it without needing to spam the button -- heck, go crazy and allow specifying ranges in aus!), i don't think this is the kind of new intel source that would replace the role of local.npc provided intel like gate feeds is an alternative idea i've been toying with."
1/4/2010,"i'm all for this. perfect intelligence like that provided by an all-seeing local window is lame.i think the primary objection to this has been that ccp has indicated it would cause immense database strain. my point of view as a software engineer is that we, as players, don't know how ccp designed the system; so players can't object on this basis -- only ccp can.another objection will come from the nrds community (of which i am a part, but i don't share the objection) in that an iff is great if you're nbsi because anybody that is not friendly is enemy; but if you're nrds then there isn't enough information there to determine if the contact is friend or foe. certainly this is true, but i think getting rid of local is worth the hassle.one point i'd like to suggest is that i'd like this to work similarly to how probes work, meaning that the value used to determine what a contact is would be derived from the signature radius divided by the sensor strength. a 'friendly' contact would be known immediately, but you'd only know the approximate size of a non-friendly contact until it was near enough that the strength of the contact's signal is high enough. the amount of information about the contact should scale higher as it gets closer. this is sort of a stealth buff to small ships. and anybody who knows me can tell you i'm a fan of small ships.edit: i should note that something like this has been suggested before, but i'm not sure exactly where that suggestion is."

1/5/2010,"supported. i've always heard that blasters are supposed to be the ultimate short-range weapon, but when other weapon systems do nearly as much dps at significantly longer range, and when blasters can't track very well at their optimal, they are not doing their job. i'd prefer a major buff to blaster tracking, and a minor increase to dps relative to the other turret systems (which might just mean a nerf of lasers/acs).gallente boats have enough troubles getting into blaster range-it's ridiculous when their supposed dps advantage turns out to be minor on paper and nonexistent in practice."

1/5/2010,hmm yes maybe i am being a bit harsh. just stopping the accumulation while inactive is enough i think.

1/5/2010,"excellent and well explained ideas, they have my support!i would however contribute with one small idea about implementing ""target priority"":- have assign/unassign to target priority queue hotkeys: select target in overview and press a assign key, it goes in target queue on first available place- up/down arrow buttons on (drone) tactical interface so when you select one target, you can move it up/down to change place (priority) in target queue.someone may have objection to idea based on assumption about boosting afk missioning, but it is not true, you can't put target from spawn wave that hasn't spawned yet.someone may object that it would give drones advantage in lag situations, like large fleet fights, when targeting and activation weapons is not easy. this would be very jealous, since its hard to launch drones anyway in lag, but once they are launched and assigned target queue they would be useful, thus giving balance. as of fleet drone commander, drone control range has to be somehow disregarded, possibly by assigning all drones to commander (needs new number of assigned drones skill). also i think that commander is better at squad level, since drones may be dispersed over large area. in case of fleet op area, drones would need to travel a lot.i think for start its best to implement it only for fighters,and only for fighters on the same grid. they can warp to target if distance is over 150 km. that would give something to carriers and moms.but great idea! i'm actually smiling while typing this, as opposed to my otherwise stone face of deprived drone user :)"
1/5/2010,they do have a physicks phd. it's the one who wrote the original 'physiks engine' and filled the eve universe with leftover beer. if i remeber correct he is specced in chaos physiks. they sent him to china though where he tries to find a way to fill the planetary enviroments with beer. one must be at least consistent afterall. the eve starsystems themselves are 'physically correct' other than planet velocities (that are set to zero for now). i mean you can have planets with that kind of masses in those locations where they are in reasonably stable manner. it's just parameters (other than mass) of those planets and moons that do not make a lot of sense and seem to have implemented in some random manner as aftertought. what i would also love to see (but it's ofc not as essential as correct planetary information) is some irregularity in the shapes of moons that are too small/light to condense properly into spherical form under their own gravity. and as far as too heavy marines go - i have always assumed that they carry some kind of power armor and heavy equipment on that.
1/5/2010,"the reasoning behind this is written here.i'll just copy the very gist of it:the current role bonus (99% reduction in warfare link module cpu need) becomes double-sided and includes reduction in power grid need, too. moreover, the new role bonus now includes a 5...8% (or even 10% !?) bonus to effectiveness of warfare links per level, but - and this is the most important - at a cost of vastly increased cap use amount of warfare links. in addition the ship becomes immune to cap-transfering, thus making it a short-term gang booster, which can activate its link (links? dunno whether we should implement a ""one-link only"" restriction, prolly we should) only for a very limited period of time.this new revamped role bonus is the feature field command ships are really really lacking at the moment."
1/5/2010,"field command ships are made of win and pwn(with the exception of the nighthawk, which is made of the pve equivalents to win and pwn), and need no changes. they have a role, and it's a good one. don't mess around with it, especially not for these rather weak reasons."
1/5/2010,"lolsorry man, but calling nh a pve ship just shows your cluelessness. along with new sleipnir, nh is the best cs around."
1/5/2010,"i read your reasoning and while i agree on the analysis of tier 1 bcs, imo both field and fleet cs could at most use a slight buff to pg/cpu, anything more and they become much too powerful. you could even say that your videos are proof they are already overpowered... i'd rather see re-balancing within the field cs class."
1/5/2010,signed
1/5/2010,"fleet command ships cannot be overpowered simply cause they have no rivals at their intended role - wide area gang boosters. that's like calling covert ops overpowered in terms of scanning.but this thread has nothing to do with fleet ones.the suggested overhaul has nothing to do with my vids either. that's just a mean to give field command ships a distinct feature which wouldn't be a direct tank/gank boost, so i don't see any problems here.and this really became an issue with the introduction of tech3 cruisers which for some weird reason got a 25% bonus for gang link effectiveness."

1/5/2010,i vote on first station.

1/5/2010,nope....no no no.afk ap'ing is stupid... foolish... it needs to stay that way.making it easier by allowing them to dock up in-spite of maintaining certain conditions is going to make it much worse.this insures a level of safety where previously it did not.the risk needs to stay in the game... not get nerf'ed out of it.

1/5/2010,"this whole thread is full of ppl who want to substantially increase the risk for the peaceful inhabitants of 0.0 for their own benefit. however, there's nothing to increase the reward.0.0 is already unsafe, and not all that rewarding. dominion helped a lot, true, but for rewards (as isk/hour seems to be the only 'reward' ppl keep referring to) you're still better off in high-sec."
1/5/2010,"paulthewise, you're absolutely right and this is why l4's (or their level of income) must be not available in empire. but this is offtopic here."
1/5/2010,"the delayed local sounds fine, but there really needs to be a system to spot allies in system instantly. even modern combat vessels have identification codes to identify them as frendlies and there is no reason why they would want to hide this info from allies. rp wise it wouldn't be an issue, since the game assumes instant information transfer to multiple outside entities already(concord, insurance, current local). all you would need to do is say, that the info is now encrypted to hide it from everyone else. as for gameplay, a system that wouldn't allow this could work decently with small, tight organisations, but the larger it gets the more cumbersome it becomes. just defferentiating your own from others shouldn't be a chore, that you are forced to repeat constantly. that would propably make some happy, but it smells more like bad game design, that would be hard to justify for rp or gameplay reasons. if you plan on nuking local totally, you need to come up with some better intel tools to replace it than we currently have. a counter for allied ships in the system would be the absolute minimum here too."
1/5/2010,showing the amount of people in local without their details would be fine.for those hung up on finding afk cloakers before supporting this proposal. you realize that their major source of intel is local chat right? and that without it they'd be stuck being active and reduced to using the same tools that you do in order to find anything out right? in other words it'd be that nerf to afk cloakers that some people keep asking for.
1/5/2010,"this also increases the risk to the attacker. the attacker doesn't know that the cloaked scout saw him enter the system, that the ratter in the belt is bait, and that reinforcements are waiting at a deep safe just outside of his scan range. because the attacker doesn't get a full count of who is in the system - only what can be seen on scan. this change makes life harder for gate camps. 2 gates in the system, you're camping one, and a new name pops up in local?? load the guns boys... here comes one! every downside of this hurts careless pilots on both sides, attack and defense. every updside benefits smart pilots on both sides, attack and defense."
1/5/2010,"not sure about the specifics of this iteration but but tradeable kill rights and a proper bounty hunting mechanism have been asked for for many years, if there's a profession that's uber cool then this one wears sunglasses at night.i wish you the best of luck in getting ccp to introduce something that many people would enjoy."
1/5/2010,what's to stop some high sec greifer using an alt to place a bounty on some hapless miner in order to harass them in high sec without concord or corporation interference?
1/5/2010,"1. a bounty can only be assigned to a pilot who is on the kill list of the bounty assigning pilot, thus by a pilot who was killed by one or more other pilot(s)."
1/5/2010,"you should only be able to place bounty if you were killed by someone who did not have the rights to shoot you (much like kill rights works currently). i'm not so sure about ""no shooting back"" though, especially because that way stupid things like drone auto-aggro would void your right to post the bounty.also, i would suggest that the bounty target should simply be flagged to all bounty hunters (i personally would propose flagging towards all militia members, but just bounty hunters work too i guess - as long as you don't have to join some npc corp or pseudo-alliance to become one). i'm not sure how much sense it makes to train fast talk v to become a bounty hunter (especially as it's a ""pirate skill"" - its primary function is making recovering sec status easier), but hell, if that's what it takes...exclusive contracts as proposed would defeat the whole affair, because the pirate can just buy out his own contracts - and also because the bounty hunter would have to go solo against the usual crapton of neutral repper bs.i can't yet propose anything better than the ""deduction from insurance"" idea (my own proposal is much less elegant); but there may have to be some sort of a limit on the bounty in that case. otherwise, a noob who as much as fired a shot at the victim, and ends up with multimillion bounty as a result, likely won't live to ever see it cleared off his dumb posterior."
1/5/2010,"i haven't read the op and i wont now. i'm 100% against this idea ever seeing the light of day because the op cross posted this in to every forum i read. (plus i had a better idea, and i know this without reading the op)"
1/5/2010,any place to see your idea?
1/5/2010,"i think with a bit more constructive input from the community, this could be the way to do bounty hunters."
1/5/2010,"too convoluted and messy.you have to get fast talk v. 4x skill which means a 20 day train. how many combat pilots have any points in charisma that you know of?then you have to train a 5x skill one bounty for each skill. then hope that the 1-3 bounties that you picked up are online at the time, not docked up, at a pos, etc.as posted above, what if they fly a frig? nah nobody flies a rifter. what if it is a t2 ship? i get 2-3m for killing an assault frigate? 5-10m for killing a hac/strategic cruiser?don't bring a friend though, that will cut your (already very poor) profits in half. the risk vs. reward on this is completely out of proportion.tldr; train for 20+ days to get a shot at risking a 50 mil+ ship for a gain of a couple million. where do i sign up?"
1/5/2010,"we need either a fixed payout for the pod, or a payout depending on implants destroyed. ofcource, t2/t3 ships need to pay out properly, and not their insurance values. this proposal goes way further then vast majority of what i have seen on the forum, and even though their are some holes,it is well worth discussing and being brought up. we also need the timeframe to be established by the person that is giving out the bounty contract, maybe i whant to put 1 bill on his ass and have him hunted for a year? we also need to allow corporation to accept the contracts. does a random person killing him in low-null-sec get payed out as par of the bounty? or maybe the guy that orders the bounty can choose percentage payout from 1 to 1000% of the ship's value, and can choose what ships he whants to pay out for. maybe he does not whant to pay out for any t1 ships, pods and shuttles. maybe he whants the guy's carrrier to be killed, then the onoly ship he will select is a carrier, and entire bounty will be given out at that point? anyway, support."
1/5/2010,"bounty hunting is one of the coolest things that set eve apart from other games and a proper system to make it an official and legitimate profession would put eve yet another mile ahead of everyone else.in eve you have the right to be as nefarious or as carebear as you want so long as you are willing to deal with the consequences, this has been ccp's attitude on most eve related matters over the years time and time again. ccp does not want to disallow something, there just has to be consequences to your actions, and this fits in perfectly with that.this is one way to ""help the helpless"" and empower newer players who are less than pvp experts (usualy need to be to kill someone who hunts for fun, gate campers excluded) and would give all the grieffers something to do (either working together on bounties or hunt each other) and thus result in less bored grieffing of newer players and bored grieffers making money grieffing, correct me if i'm wrong but thats a win/win/win. olders players are happy, newer players get some sort of resolve for crimes commited, ccp gets more newer players sticking around.support this and whatever comes of it."
1/5/2010,"not supported.the idea of renovating the bounty system is an old one. with the understanding that this implementation needs more fleshing out, it seems like a proposal that will get torpedoed by the ""what if this happens?"" crowd.that and your post in c&p was trolly and wasted cpu cycles."
1/5/2010,"i have put a link to this post into my signature to promote it. that is, as far as i know, not cross-posting. i have explicitly posted an information about this proposal in the crime and punishment board, because the pilots frequenting it would be affected the most by it. i have not posted just one sentence of my op at some other place, so no cross posting again. i can only guess why you don't like this proposal ..."
1/5/2010,"thank you all for your support so far. i'm fully aware, that i cannot provide a complete and loophole free idea, i just try to propose something which includes as much as i think needs to be included to make bounty hunting workable and unabusable.as we have already seen here, together with others this can turn out to become a good enough idea to get it on the table of the csm, and probably to find a ccp dev to make it happen.that pirates don't like it, is only natural."

1/5/2010,"came in because the title said ""ideas inside"". didnt find a single solitary idea.lets assume the figure of 90% is accurate. does it matter? null/lowsec is there- its not like ppl cant find it. simply put they are not welcome there. null sec is not practical for an individual or a small corp. (10-30 members)the issue isnt that ppl want to go there- the issue is the ppl there do not want others in their space.ah the usual risk vs reward argument. how much danger is there doing a null sec gatecamp again? how much danger is there ratting deep in null in a dead end system?hi sec has risk- to say it doesnt is ignorant. no ship is ever safe in eve.do you have the slightest idea of what this would do? its a simple fact- manufacturers dont pay taxes- they pass the costs to the customers who buy their products. so fine- triple market taxes. you ,the customer, are the ones paying them in the long run anyway.eliminate hi sec- either completely or through nerfs- and a large percentage of the players stop playing. its really that simple.seriously your post contained one idea- and it wasnt thought out at all. your propose nerfing hi sec into the ground. you have shown no knowledge of game mechanics or market mechanics and do not seem to realize what would happen if even 50% of the population stopped playing. (which would happen in the first month without hisec)if you truly want ppl in nullsec- then null sec corps need to accept new members. nullsec has to become more then ""blob the gate"". ccp has started the process with dominion. but they can not change the prevalent attitudes of those who live there.in case ive been too subtle- not supported"
1/5/2010,"want to populate low sec? want to reduce the massive isk faucet that is high sec? i will gladly tell you how.1: remove meta0 tech1 modules from npc loot tables that can be produced by players.2: reduce the drone alloy drop rate by 25%.3: reduce the asteroid quality population's sec level, e.g massive scordite only found in 0.7 or below. 4: drop down asteroid types sec population so as only basic minerals can be mined in highsec.5: increase the asteroid population and yield for the higher grade asteroids for sec 0.5 and below6: increase the pg & cpu of mining barges and exhumers so they can fit cruiser up to battleship level tanks.7: simplify the system for hiring mercenaries with a real time lfg like inplementation.8: increase the insurance payout for gold level insurance if the ship was destroyed in an illegal attack.that should see a move to low sec."
1/5/2010,"i see where you're coming from. but these mods don't exactly inspire confidence for carebears to flock to lo sec and mission or mine. wcs are only useful in transports. they don't really help pve ships much. hics can easily lock any battleship running missions in lo sec. **also, probing mechanics are ridiculously broken and in favor of the predator. you can probe down a mission runner in seconds and in almost complete silence. couple this with killboard *****s camping lo sec entry points and killing just about anything that moves and it becomes clear that lo sec just isn't meant for pve."
1/5/2010,"hello all,i think we can all agree that the poses as they exist today are a logistical nightmare and a general pain to work with. it is for this reason that i designed a ground-up reworking of their mechanics.i would like to give credit to those who helped me refine this proposal. evelgrivion's assistance with the basic idea and the threads about the reworking were the foundation of this document. herschel yamamoto, song li, and phoenixdawn helped me refine the document, as well as some of the people from the features and ideas thread i created for it.the document is now worked out enough to be a good starting point for implementation, but more work is always needed and constructive criticism is always welcomed. i am looking for a graphic artist to help me with an image of the pos control ui, so any help is welcomed, and some payment can be arranged if necessary. however, without further ado, here's the document:"
1/5/2010,"fueling does need streamlined, and if we could get the pos system condensed so its an all in one unit it would be great. atleast allow prod. units to pull materials from a corp hanger without manually moving the items. it could utilize some tweakung short term though without a massive rework."
1/5/2010,"supporting this as i have for the past... uh... farking forever.edit:i'm not sure i agree entirely with the ice mining changes, however. (partially because i seem to recall ccp saying they don't want to remove static belts for one reason or another) another way to achieve a similar end might be to add a fuel type requirement for something that can only be found in the new scannable sites. but adding more fuel types seems like a step backwards."
1/5/2010,"pos are soooo broke it's not even funny, or fun, to want to bother with them.they need to be ripped down, recoded, revamped, and re-issued in a more logical, easier to manage, more fun less chore design.this is a game, not a job. we're not getting paid for the managing the nightmarish things, we're paying to have to deal with them. that's just broken.get 'er fixed, ccp!"
1/5/2010,"as demonstrated by current t2 market prices, particularly for ships, t2 invention has taken a serious hit in the latest patch. nothing definitive has been discovered, but polling experienced t2 ship bpc inventers will show a decrease in success rates in almost every instance.with this in mind, it's time to even the playing field. if it's now more difficult to invent a t2 bpc, then it's time to get rid of the t2 bpo's. the economic advantage they give their owners is far beyond what could remotely be considered ""fair"". i realize that many of you will scoff at my using that word in eve, but a level playing field has always been a part of ccp's goal. the continued existance of t2 bpo's drastically skews the markets. i realize that removing t2 bpo's will have a hugely negative impact at the eve tribune, and i apologize for that. i'm willing to contribute to the tribune to help make up for the loss, since i'm proposing the idea, but i can't let that be a deciding factor in addressing this issue.my proposal is that t2 bpo's be converted to 50-run bpc's, in order to give some further, but short-lived, advantage to those who possess them. that will allow their owners time and resources to get into the invention process that the rest of the industrialist base must utilize.the goal of weapon balancing, speed nerfs, and a whole host of other changes has been for a better balance, and more pvp opportunities - do the same for the industrialists. pvp is the heart of the market. allowing a ship that can't be killed to go out and kill other ships would bring unanimous calls for either nerfing or destroying this bugged ship. eve is about newer players being able to compete with more experienced players on a fairly even playing field in relatively short order - in no other aspect of eve is an older, more experienced player rewarded with an asset that, so long as they are reasonably careful, can never be taken away, and will provide them with a constant and continuing advantage, no matter how skilled their opponent becomes. in an arena where more isk is risked by even the small players every week than most pvp'rs risk in a month, it's time that winning is based on player skill and a bit of luck, not on flying an indestructable ship. it's time to get rid of t2 bpo's.tho only other reasonable proposal is to make it possible for newer players to obtain new t2 bpo's, and i don't think anyone is going to seriously consider that."
1/5/2010,bpos and inventions are balanced. seriously.stop whining.greetings from a happy inventor.
1/5/2010,yeah remove t2 bpos.
1/5/2010,"how about stop whining about the bpos existing and actually work out the profits on these bpos, this isnt the days of the lottery anymore.t2 bpos don't make nearly as much profit as they used to. invention makes far more and in a lot of cases is actually responsible for the low prices for most of the t2 items that you see today.the reason that t2 prices are going up, is because of the requirements being changed in dominion, and because of the market pvp being conducted over technetium.give the t2 producers time to adjust to the dominion changes and you will probably see prices start to stabilise."
1/5/2010,"1) learn how a random number generator work. nothing has changed in success ratio;2) the material required to produce t2 ships have been changed and the market is still in a state of flux, that is the reason why invention is less rewarding, but it is a temporary state."
1/5/2010,this.
1/5/2010,then removing them wont be a huge problem for their owners or the market :)
1/5/2010,"this thing comes up regularly. it regularly gets beaten down.i call it ""a solution looking for a problem.""you try to solve a problem that doesnt exist.and cheating everyone, who bought their t2 bpo, out of their money isnt a solution either."
1/5/2010,just give them 3 years worth of bpc runs and that excuse is also gone.supporting proposals of doing away with relics of bad game design.
1/5/2010,"the days when t2 bpos made fantastic profits are long gone. the profits are still there, but they are not substantially greater than inventing. (i invent and have t2 bpos)previous stats from dr. g have demonstrated that t2 bpos make up a very small percentage of the total production of t2 stuff. the effect of mass invention has been to reduce the price of t2 stuff to the point where most are well below that of named or faction modules. there is no evidence for the op's statement that ""t2 bpos drastically skew the market.""t2 bpos now have the effect of keeping prices down as they produce in bulk, where inventors produce in small batches. market manipulation of bulk materials is more difficult to achieve.personally, i have seen no changes in invention success rates.the op needs to research his topic more effectively and provide real statistical evidence for his proposal. this has all been well aired before."
1/5/2010,"currently bpos sell at roughly 5-7years roi. yes it is a bit overprized but people pay it. and did you notice the op had 50 run copies? this is kind of lol. making bpos worth billion into a bpc worth less than 10m?i dont own any bpo, but i still dont see them as a problem. show me any bpo owner that can produce 10-20 lines of the same item in parallel. and that is what balances bpos and invention.<sacarsm>i wonder why nobody cries about all those old t1 producers with their highly researched t1 bpos. maybe we should reset them once in a while again so they have to research them again? they have such an advantage over us newcomer!especially with those capital bpos!</sacarm>as everyone likes numbers: we track the success rate of our inventions. the average has been around 48.1-48.3% for the whole time of our tracking. (roughly 1y)"
1/5/2010,"i'm an inventor, and i think your idea is silly. it's fine, learn to play."
1/5/2010,"i missed the good ol' days of bpo's, i say bring them back, but let the invention process remain in existance as well."
1/5/2010,"agreed.to all the naysayers:yes, you do get warnings, but they are not significant. being warp disrupted is a very important matter in this game because it is responsible for almost all ship losses. the notification that you should receive should be proportional to its significance. currently, you only get two warnings, one of them; a short message in the middle of your screen that can get easily flooded by weapon damage notifications. another, the tiny 13x13 pixel icon on the edge of your overview. in my opinion, the warnings should be more visible."
1/5/2010,i'd like to have an audio warning at every time a notification were to pop up. also i'd like to know how many of which type of point is being put on me. even if the tiny little icons were different colours it'd be near impossible to tell which is dark blue and which is light blue at a glance.
1/5/2010,"i missed the snipe, but i have 1 thing to say..""you can not warp because you are warp scrambled""."
1/5/2010,"recognition can come from player corporations, if they so choose to award them, for character more than anything else or they can make up 'titles' that have meaning in the corporation. joining fw also can net you rank/award but that is pvp so you still have the certificates for non pvp. as a non pvp'er i know killmails are crap anyway plenty of them are noobs or industrial ships, etc or wow a gang of 5 people took out 2 ships hooray for you and your killmail. it is a meaningless 'award' but acquiring them en masse says something, which is up to everyone to decide for themselves. i see ranks as pointless, because i don't need anyone to recognize the skills i've learned, beyond the fact that i can do this and that so i can add to a group in certain ways advertising them isn't something i do or would do anyway."
1/5/2010,"because artificial ranks ascribing qualities to pilots that may or may not exist based on a broken certificate system is a terribad idea that rewards rote following of crap over actual experience?i've played this game for over 3 years, and am apparently only core competent at the basic level. why? i've never felt the need to lock more than 6 targets. oops.if you want real rank and recognition for what you do, chat with your corp. if not well-known throughout eve like chribba, you can be recognised for what you do for your comrades - and if you're nice enough, they can even give you trinkets for it!"
1/5/2010,lets not forget that a week old player can beat the crap out of a several year old player. player skills > ingame skills.
1/5/2010,"and interesting idea, but no thanks. the current certificate system means very little when a corporation will often want experience over sp (and lets be fair, sp is something you generate from doing nothing).the below point also highlights another key issue:i've never understood allot of certificates, the core give a clear example - very few ships gain anything from the skill multitasking, so why is it classed as skill requirement for core?dont take the negativity as anything personal though!"
1/5/2010,"supported, whenever ccp can get around to it."
1/5/2010,"minor, but handy. odd that it doesn't work this way already, but it should be easy to copy the code over."
1/5/2010,i would like this.
1/5/2010,would very much like this as well.
1/5/2010,"...hopefully instead of copy & paste they'll refactor it properly this time, though.since this is probably due to duplicated code it might even fall under the umbrella of the ""corification"" process they keep talking about. :)"
1/5/2010,sounds good to me.
1/5/2010,"supported.also change the killmail format in the api to xml or something else more easily machine-parseable (or add a second format). ship fittings can be exported as xml, so why not killmails?"

1/5/2010,1
1/5/2010,"i had the npc imbalance issue in my npc thread and was told that this is already being addressed by the csm.supported, of course. (i still think npcs should be removed completely and replaced with a) a mini-game to discourage afk-plexing, b) a notifcation to the hostile militia to encourage actual fights, and c) a minimum ship size requirement to capture both for attackers and defenders to encourage using more than t1 frigates; npcs in any form discourage cool fights)"
1/5/2010,"supported.npc should not be in the focus of plexing at all. being able to solo them for each faction in a proper ship should be possible, to still allow solo players to solo.removing npcs all together with something else, e.g. mini game hacking the plex after maybe killing just one initial medium difficult wave would be nice.plexes should keep you in space for a while so the other side has to time to get there. spreading intel/a notifcation to the hostile militia though imho is job of the players. if one side is to lazy or to stupid to ""guard"" their own space, its their loss. keep it ""active players vs active players"" rather lazy blobbers vs lazy blobbers."
1/5/2010,agreed and supported.one of many issues we hope to see addressed before soon(tm)
1/5/2010,supported for everyone except lexa hellfury.
1/5/2010,create a new skills that when trained to lvl5 cuts the timer down to 12hrs. it can be a high level skill to train i dont care. it would make my life and im sure many other people lives in the game so much better.
1/5/2010,"not really a new proposal, and no.unfortunately what makes your life easier (not better, btw) is not necessarily in the best interests of the game. i'm not opposed to the idea of a skill to reduce the timer, but 10% per level is too sharp a decline."
1/5/2010,why do people continue to post repeating proposals that fail and yet they keep trying?
1/5/2010,"there's a far simpler way to approach the jump clone problem.linkapparently its possible to visit at least 3 different systems in a given day, not counting where the character may have been before the board meeting, or after dinner.rather than make another skill which reduces the timer, just tweak the current skill to function properly.nowhere in that description, does it say the mind is taxed by having several inert clones around the cosmos. it says the mind is taxed by the effort of moving between them.so simply change the skill, to allow +1 clone per level, and +1 jump per day.then if you train lvl i, you have 1 clone, and can jump to it once a day (as it is today).if you train lvl v, you can have up to 5 clones, and could jump between any of them up to 5 times in a day."
1/5/2010,just being able to clone-jump at all is powerful enough; i think the timer is fine as is.
1/5/2010,"agreed. a much better proposal is one i saw in another discussion: allow more frequent jump-clones, but only allow the player to jump-clone to a new clone in their current station or to a jump-clone in a rorqual or titan. has the added bonus of making the capital clone vat bays actually useful."
1/5/2010,"drake draconis, yes it is a very small nerf. and as i said, remove them covops cloak when (if) the local window also gets removed. it really bothers me when you choose to read half the sentence which is the last and least important point anyway :/as for you malcanis, spherical and m^2? are you even doing any math? mixing meters with kilometers while you try to prove *something* just shows that no, you don't know what you're talking about. small ships now, they do get instapopped if they have their mwd on which has a cycle of 10s. actually anything that has a signature larger than 400m, eg dictors, it will receive 100% damage. and even if it gets a smaller percentage of that, that % * 8k is enough to dip it low into armor/structure or maybe instapop it. 7 times that damage, you've got yourself a minidd.your alliance is not under any scrutiny by me, and using your alliance name to prove something doesn't really prove anything. my alliance does rr bs gangs, i didn't mention it all. why should i? ""hey guys i'm rzr, we're pro, i write something, it's true because i'm rzr""the goal is to balance bombers. ways of getting into a system is completely irrelevant. if you're talking about bridging people in through a cyno, well, that makes bombing even easier as ships appear uncloaked next to the cyno.anyway, i'm done caring for this thread. the proposal is there, the facts are stated, let's see what the csm has to say about this."
1/5/2010,not supportedwhat is the problem with bombers btw other than the laggy situations?
1/5/2010,"so, you want bombs' speed cut in half, and think that bringing the explosion radius (do you mean velocity?) up is enough to counter it...honestly, if you're in a bomber and you die to smartbombs you're doing it wrong, completely wrong.also, bss should not be blobbed nor should they sit stationary. if you pay attention to your overview or are not set up against it (rr, snipe) you can escape a typical bomb run.. if you're good not supported, bombs are just fine the way they are."

1/5/2010,"i propose that we should have a seperate forum topic for lottos, casinos, and anything gambling.rules*edit - like any other forum topic (as suggested by herschel y)otherlike this forum, you can support an event with a thumbs up.posting format[3rd party] [event type] name [status]ie.[chribba] [lotto] new eden casino [running][f90oex] [free event] t'ambergank xxvi [registration][none] [poker] poker princess [running]prosless carp in the sell and events forums.if you aren't interested you don't have to look at them. your sell orders arn't bumped off the screen every second.conspossibly more work for forum moderators.although this would cause a loss in custom for myself there is lots of carp and thb i think it should be somewhere other than the events or sell forum.-t'amber"
1/5/2010,"i wouldn't object to a forum of this sort(though i'd think of it as morte of a spacebook change than one for immediate addition), except for one small problem...sorry dude, you may be offering a lottery, but you're offering an eve lottery. the only time scams are banned in eve is when real money is paid to ccp to secure the trade - i.e., characters or gtcs. other than that, it's caveat emptor. this is simply wrong for this game. for that matter, you even assume the eve standard of finding a third party you trust(or f9) to secure the contract, because it's not secured by any sort of court system naturally. remove that clause, and your plan may be workable, but as is, it's just wrong."

1/5/2010,at one of the fanfests ccp spoke about a simulated arena like you are mentioning and that they already have deigns in the works.i'm guessing the horrible lag in 0.0 fights and the balancing of other things that got broken is their higher concern at the moment though

1/6/2010,"greets to all.proposal: inclusion of an option to disable avatars / portraits within chat channel participant listing.why: currently, players are able to choose between zero, small and large portraits in chat channels.players can also choose to display no participant listing.working with dozens of open windows or low resolution displays, one aims to cram as much relevant information into any given window.currently, the largest element in any chat window is the participant list, and it can't be reduced or re-sized, effectively forcing a minimum window size.the option to disable the portraits and simply display the names of participants (and relevant corporation / standings icons) will alleviate this.benefits: less clutter, enables smaller participant listings, fewer requests on tq for portraits / avatars upon clicking on a channel participants name.useful for rapidly changing and popular channels (the help channel, anyone?) and particularly for finding specific individuals within said channel.detriments: coding / ui team time allocation, obviously. makes local chat somewhat easier to use as an intel tool.----please feel free to add suggestions / comments, but if this has already been raised (although i haven't found something similar), do let me know."
1/6/2010,supporting this.
1/6/2010,"fairly confident that there is a setting to only pull portraits when you click on a character (as all portraits are blank for me unless i click on someone). i seem to recall finding out about this once upon a time, before a large fleet fight, in the pre-fight ""turn everything off"" speech.found it... esc""general settings""""general""x ""generate character picture when clicked"""
1/6/2010,i believe the op was also looking to reduce the real-estate used in the participant list. even if you do not click to get the portrait a portrait sized amount of space with the no-portrait graphic is shown making the participant list longer than needed.i believe the request is for an option (as there is in the chat window itself) to not show any sort of graphic and just have a list of names and appropriate badges.i support this idea

1/6/2010,"your third party app ? numbers are erroneous , the numbers i have given you are taken straight from the game , dps adjusted for for lack of neccessary skills.the cane is faster and cap stable. the drake isnt.your dps numbers for the drake are way off , i have in game produced more dps than your are calculating even with less than perfect skills.the point you seems to be happily ignoring and dismissing off hand as ok , is the drake losses 25% of it firepower whereas the cane does not."
1/6/2010,"cause if they could use their weapon system to it's full potential it would be a bit overpowered tbh.yuhh, you can change missile types....you just might not get bonused to them....not like you're getting penalized."
1/6/2010,"ham drake677 dps, 80318 ehp as earlier stated (i did not claim 82k).. the plus 1% pg is fine with a pg2 implant, try adding it to ur all v's profile if you don't believe me.iirc the fitting window in eve does not take into account active modules so you were getting the ehp for my fit with the invuls turned off. eft takes this into account, with this in mind it also gives 90853 with the invuls overheating. so there you have it.- almost bs level ehp- dps to rival any gank bc- only requires the 2 mil isk pg2 implant not the 20 smth mil isk pg4 your cane does- is actually a bit faster than your cane- has ability to over heat for even higher ehpyes imo this would be stupidly op given full dmg on em/exp missiles and i actually fly the damn thing"

1/6/2010,"on the other hand weve got the fact that the kin damage bonus is balanced on ships that arent already suffering from other, unconnected problems.and also; anyone who claims the eve fitting screen details are more accurate than evefit needs to sit back and think about it for a second; because 1) it doesnt take active modules into account, and 2) they need to check that all the modules are actually online! no ship without a considerable amount of cap regen, which is to say more than one cap recharger on a lolfit could ever impart is going to be cap stable when mwding. cap stability with mwd and without gimping the ship is only possible for asssault frigates."
1/6/2010,nvm cba
1/6/2010,"you'll see if you look at the screenie that the hardners are active as is the dcu , the screenie was taken is space.you drake fit has 61k ehp not 80kehp.as battleships routinelly surpase 100kehp your drake fit has only 60% the buffer of a bs.there may be some small difference in speed i did not measure it.a 20m pg implant is nothing.considering you cant constantly overheat your hardners and they have a 10 second cycle time , you would be lucky to get more than a couple of extra kehp from overheating as you would have to wait for yourself to be called primary and then wait for the hardner cycles to finish before activating overheat, by which time a lot of the primary buffer would be gone.but yeah maybe you can squeeze a couple of extra k out of overheat.the cane fit is complettly cap stable , whilst the drake fit can only manouver on mwd for approx 4 minutes before it has to stop using its mwd or risk losing large amounts of ehp.i never said this fits are identical , i said they are similar.is the cane fit op doing mostly em/exp with rf emp or fusion ?"
1/6/2010,"the kin bonus is not balanced at all , as shown numerous times a pilot only gets 1/3rd the damage output benifit on average compared to rof|dpl damage bonuses if he fires optimal ammo for training time spent on those hulls.the eve fitting screen does take into account module activation if you are in space and switch on those modules.you can check this for yourself the next time you play eveonline instead of evefit offline."
1/6/2010,"typo fixed, noob. looking at your bc record, you barely fly caldari ships anyway, or any ship larger than a frigate. that explains the hurricane lolfit, at least. let's see... the last missile boats lost are a badly-fit aml drake (oh the lolfit blaster-ferox is nice though), a stupid crow (rigour with rockets!), a lolafterburning passive faildrake, a rocket manticore (seriously!) and a purger ii-rigged nighthawk. good grief.it's fair to say that my experience and knowledge of missile pvp is far in excess of yours."

1/6/2010,"like i said , ego.until you can get over yourself you wont be able to be constuctive in this topic because it wasnt you that realised what the problem with cmb's is.gypsio has earned the right to claim he is a better pvp'r than me and he is.even if his subsequent ego prevents him from accepting that anothers view of a facet of this game may be correct.you however are nothing more than an eft warrior and a really bad one at that.until yesterday when i explained it to you you didn't even know what dps meant.you know less than nothing about pvp judgeing from your non existant pvp record."
1/6/2010,"translation - ""anyone disagreeing with me is being unconstructive"".push for the change all you want. my position has been the same all along - the bad missile boats are bad not because of a kinetic bonus, but because they lack fittings, or because rockets/cruise needs fixing. or because of shield transfer cpu requirements. you're attempting to claim that one simple change will fix these ships, but it isn't that simple and they deserve to be fixed properly.individual ships deserve individual fixes. blanket changes are crude and lazy. it's interesting to note that the recent blanket projectile ammo changes gave the biggest boosts to ships that didn't really need boosting that much - rifter, hurricane, vaga, sleipnir - while not really fixing (although obviously it did help them) the weaker minnie ships, such as cyclone (awkward split weapons, shortage of medslots), tempest (shield or armour?, awkward slot layout), maelstrom (shield transporter cpu).the proposed blanket af ab bonus was seen to be similarly flawed, as it would produce only ~3 afs worth flying (jag, harpy, ishkur), while completely ignoring the problems of trash like the hawk."
1/6/2010,"thanks i will push for the change.you keep describing this as a blanket change, but its not really.i'm asking for a bonus to be changed , one single bonus.that bonus is applied to many ship types but its still only one type of bonus.individual fixes are not currently possible that will make cmb's ""balanced""why ?because a ship that has a 1.6% per level damage bonus can never be balanced against a ship that has a 5% per level damage bonus.a 1.6% bonused ship can be balanced versus a 5% bonused ship at any given player skill level.it is therefore mathematically impossible for it to be balanced at any other player skill level.for instance.if x = y ( balanced ) at level 0.then at level 5x5 = x * ( 1 + 0.016 * 5 ); x5 = 1.08 * xy5 = x * ( 1 + 0.05 * 5 ); y5 = 1.25 * xccp can tinker with individual stats on ships giving them better fitting or making the weapons roflkets a bit better.and lets say that now a cmb is balanced at player skill level 5.if it still has a 1.6% per level damage bonus then its impossible for that ship to be balanced against its peer equivelents at lower player skill levels.in order to get there ( balanced at lvl5 ) then the cmb must be overpowered at lower player skill levels.but even if you they do manage to balance out the cmb's at lvl 5 , there would still remain the unfixed issue of low skill players having the same dps as high skill players in 2/3rd of engagements.prime example is lvl2 cal cruiser pilot in a cara verus a lvl5 cal cruiser pilot also in a cara.most damageing heavy thunderbolt.the 20 days training done by the lvl5 pilot can in no way help him win the engagement , 20 days training down teh toilet.all the tinkering with ship stats in the world can never fix the issue that training done on caldari hulls is not equally valuable as training done on the hulls as other races."
1/6/2010,hilarious...so your saying that because i have the sense to use an alt for forum work i have no pvp track record? utterly hilarious...and im not the one that doesnt realise eve's-fitting screen is less accurate than the evefit program...nor am i the one unable to see a forum alt for what it is...nor am i the one unable to understand that balancing is far more complex than ham-fisted attempts to boost things in area's they dont need boosting to compensate for unrelated area's that cause them to be fail.
1/6/2010,"this ^^^ minmatar got help where it wasn't needed, no help where it was needed and a fotm novelty patch up job on arty. because of lazy blanket ""fixing"".don't repeat that with caldari."
1/6/2010,"gypsio iii strange that you mentioned ham drake as your latest losses only show hml drakes, hmm if the ham drake is so good and as you are lowsec pvper wanabee anyway ,why dont you use ham drakes?oh i have more kills than you possibly even with missiles only ,so according to you that makes me more expert with missiles :)still no other race loose its dmg bonus by changing ammo type only those not well thought out missile ships with 1 type of dmg bonuses.would changing those make any ships op ,absolutely not , would those be fixed probably not , would those be less crappy definitely.i see not even one reason why not change those bonuses to not ammo dependant bonuses.btw stop drakeing thx."
1/6/2010,"i shall attempt to answer your question without mentioning the d****.several reasons - my hml damage implant that i got for my cerb, the increased tactical flexibility of hms over hams, and i had a torp damage implant instead of the pg implant that the ham drake really benefits from. in gang, i favour hmls over hams because of the ability of hmls to reach out to ecm boat range; solo i appreciated the ability to apply dps from the edge of disruptor range - an important consideration when fighting outnumbered, often against more mobile opponents and when anything could be bait.further discussion here."
1/6/2010,"i would like to see a smoother process for bm's with many of the changes suggested, *however*... the problem i have is with instant sharing of bookmarks and the effect it has for those operating in wh space; you become massively more vulnerable.at the moment typically a scout scans down a wh, enters, scouts out the hole for signatures, players and pos facilities. should any juicy targets turn up they have to exit the wh to share the kspace location of the wh to the rest of their gang. this gives two chances to spot the enemy and a little time to respond.with instant bookmark sharing, if a scout needs a single positive result to allow the rest of the gang to immediately head to the wh and get in to back them up any non-pvp fit operation (mining?) is toast as the only notification you get is when they are already in warp towards you.a counter would be having someone diligently watching the wh for that characteristic flash as a ship enters, but it is very boring for that individual to do. it also means you waste a player/account on that (which if wh's are for small gangs to succeed in, you can't often spare). you need to know when the scout enters, the point an enemy combat fleet enters a wh is already too late for your gang as from experience tacklers can often align, warp and lock faster than a hulk takes to get up to speed.as wh are often scanned down in the operating region of the scout's corp, finding a fleet to gank that wh mining operation is usually going to be easy.don't get me wrong, i am happy with the pew, but sometimes when there is no-one or nothing to shoot, it can be profitable to spend your time mining. if bookmarks could be instantly shared, i would cope, but instead of ""living"" in a wh, i would scan down a bunch of wh's before prime, and then go through each of them until i found a mining op to bring the corp down on. this could be further sped up by having all the corp scanning wh's, and switching to combat ships when the (more likely to find) opportunities arrive.as a suggestion, i would implement the majority of the suggestions, but require bm's to be added to or retrieved from a corp/alliance/'trusted user' bm ""store"" in a station, outpost or pos (the tower would make sense). this would allow the benefits of sharing bookmarks in a logical way, but also require gank fleets to do a little planning still rather than making it really simple for any opportunistic pilot to 'bring the rain' on every op.for those who operate in wh space, having that functionality in a pos is a must.the roleplay version would be ""a bm is not merely a location, but the alignment data and technical readouts necessary for an accurate warp"". imagine it being a big, big bunch of data specific to your ship, with the ""exported"" bm you currently have in cargo being the raw data so another ship type could compute it for themselves. that way, you can argue that pos, outpost, and station (and maybe caps, supercaps or blackops bs to expand it's role) have the additional cpu and comms facilities for massive data transfers.on a different subject to the above, collaborative corp/alliance wh operations require bm's in cans rather than hangers so any improvement on that lag fest would be great.p.s. this is posted on an alt for security purposes."

1/6/2010,"i sold my 360 to buy parts for my pc. was an avid console gamer. but alas fps suck on console.(how many good fps are on consoles?)didn't the fps start on pc?will it not be harder to develop an expanding role playing game on a limited console machine? when do they run out of resources and have to wait for the next gen console to come out?360 is nearing the end of its life as is.too many bad console ports have come direct to pc as of late. and now they are losing dedicated server support as well.(modern warfare 2)where you were able to have massive servers with 40 to 60 people shooting it out, the console has dumbed down our gaming experience to a dismal 4v4 because of matchmaking and hosting on less than able console machines. will this be true for dust as well?hate to say it but the underwhelming console is officially strangling the pc to death. the console gaming pie is too big for ccp to not get into the action.(it's ok we all like money) but it's sad to see them slap the people who put them in this position in the first place."
1/6/2010,"i agree console exclusivity for dust makes no scene. it can be on console but it also need's to be on pc. specially when it is going to be tied directly into eve sov mechanics. i think it will just screw up the entire game (eve), more specifically for the smaller alliance where not many people have consoles. the way i see things it will just tighten the mega alliance's grip on 0.0 space. which defeats the purpose of dominion as it was designed to make 0.0 more assessable."

1/6/2010,"one point we want to keep in mind, commandships are supposed to be less attractive to be shoot so they can give the fc a base to stay longer in the fight and also have the bonuses longer. making them a bigger threat would void that role.just a thought."
1/6/2010,"yet another person asking for changes to game mechanics to fit their playstyle... without consideration of other players.the gang link bonus was reduced by ccp for balancing. if those reasons for the reduction are no longer valid, a look at the bonus' may be in order.everything else you want to accomplish can already be done by tailoring the fitting of the ships as they are.if that results in a 'gimped' fit, it was intended to prevent the ships being overpowered."
1/6/2010,"what exactly are you talking about? how will my playstyle benefit from the proposed changes? there's no reason whatsoever to fit a gang link onto field command ship since this results in the reduced performance in other areas. and as the efficiency of the said link is the same as at regular tech1 bc, it's pretty obvious to use latter ones, since you're gimping a less valuable (damage wise at the first place) ship.the gang link bonus was reduced? how's that? i've been playing since sep '05 and no changes were done for the role bonus of commands ships through all these years.the role bonus has always been that stupid and useless. it became even more stupid over years with the introduction of tier2 bcs and scs.yet again i'm pointing at strategic cruisers which happen to be better at gang boosting then the command ships class itself. how is this balanced?i know everyone wants an op ship for themselves (see drakes which are considered as 'fine'), but this hypocrisy is just getting beyond any limits"

1/6/2010,"probably some. but they did the same thing when they banned it pretty publicly in the first place. and besides, you just have to describe what, not how - ""intentionally warping inside a pos shield that you do not have access to for the purposes of knocking ships outside the shield is a bannable exploit."" would be a perfectly reasonable way to do it, for example."
1/6/2010,"i must agree that a proper list of exploits would be very beneficial so people know what actions can get you banned outside of the usual obvious things (hacking, botting, etc.) it would be very important to keep the list updated so as to also avoid claims of ""well x wasn't listed"".the list should not describe how to do the action, but what the action is. for example; ""bumping other ships through a pos shield that is considered locked and/or hostile."" would be sufficient to explain pos bowling. others, of course, would require more descriptions; such as a full list of ""disposable alt"" uses that are considered exploits."

""bubble up"" ""i hate you guys, you just bubbled a slow moving fleet/gang from your own alliance/block"" -roaming-""scout jumping in... 2 in local, make that 3, make that 4...""""eyes?""""no, scanning... found stuff""""well, we can't ask in intel channels or alliance, as they were littered with spies even before they became the uber intel source they now (would be) are""""warping to them... oh, just another alliance/block gang, sorry guys""-fleets-well, they are horribly difficult to organize/manage as is (255 max fleet size if nothing else), making local just a number would lead to mass chaos. perhaps, a year from now, the first 30 minutes of fleet will not have to be spent explaining how to use broadcasts (please, please, please, please require everyone who hasn't been to 0.0 to complete a tutorial on fleet broadcasts - for the love of odin).pve - the ratting and mining that dominion was supposed to centralize, instead of being spread all over the place, would be its undoing:""local went up, everyone safe and cloak...""""sorry guys, roam coming back, you're safe""""oh noes! our 10-man mining operation just was bombed to death by a disco raven that jumped in when the roam came back!!!!1111""alliance - the logistics of simply undocking in a home system would become ridiculously tedious, as seen below:""anyone know if local is blue in our capital system, where local is always full, and dominion allows significantly more ratting/mining to go on in a single system leading to much larger local populations that are not docked (so comparing docked count to local count will not work).""***repeat every 30 seconds as each pilot wants to do something but has to make sure they are safe to, followed by an inevitable***""i'm dying!!!!!!11111 you said it was blue!!!!!1111""""it was 30 seconds ago. sorry.""in short, you would need to add additional things to the change as op laid out for it to be functional. specifically, a fof system of some form for each case."

1/6/2010,"definately agree! 0.0 space should be dangerous, not the current situation where people can run to a pos or station as soon as a neutral or red ship arrives. i'm not saying it should be changed to the extent that a whole fleet can jump into a system, raep all the miners or ratters they can find and leave without anyone having a clue they were there til the kms appear.it'd certainly force people to wake up, start playing the game tactically and encourage some teamwork."

1/6/2010,"there is a reason they all run to station. it is just not profitable to start sitting with a pvp fleet besides the miners to defend them, and ships to run anomalies with (just like missions) dont have a chance against pvp ships.so then the only result would be that in beginning there are many easy ganks on the pve ships, then they go run lvl 4 missions in high sec."

1/6/2010,"for 3/5ths of the day the in-game help channel flows along perfectly fine.it's a mixed discussion of help queries, game mechanics, module, ship and user interface help.then isd gsilver comes online.he goes on the war-path and gags anyone who isn't doing q&a one-line answers with zero discussion.help is reduced, people are locked in a cage and afraid to answer questions.gsilver takes over, vomics ego, ruins the channel.at this stage most helpers leave."
1/6/2010,"i second this. i'm in help almost every day and seems nobody disrupts it more than gsilver. he threatens muting for anybody that wants to explain a little more on the subject of the person's problem instead of just giving an answer on how to fix it. it's prompted me to just convo the people to help, which takes away from everyone else i could be helping in the channel."
1/6/2010,"i remember relying on that channel a great deal when i was starting out. i also think i remember gsilver there too, but it wasn't like you describe. the channel does strike me as a somewhat stressful one to monitor over though. if that job is left to a constant set of people i cant imagine anyone who wouldnt eventually snap. maybe if ccp had all of their gms rotated through there (they may currently do this i have no idea) it would take the edge off the job."
1/6/2010,this thread is unlikely to remain unlocked for long. ccp does not care for comments on its forums regarding ctritique of their staff.your best course of action is to petition against the gm in question using the section of the petitions reserved for just that.windjammer
1/6/2010,"while i agree that the behaviour you describe seems crazy, i'm not sure the csm is the right venue for it. it just seems likely to cause more hostility than solutions if the csm goes to iceland and starts naming names. that said, i don't know what the right way is - i assume you've tried taking this directly to the fellow himself, and he's been unreceptive? if so, try finding out who's in charge of isd, and taking it to them. be reasonable, try not to disparage the fellow too seriously(remember, isd are unpaid volunteers), and see if that gets you anywhere.best of luck getting this solved - if the fellow does as you say, it could seemingly use a solution. but this seems the wrong approach."
1/6/2010,"this is part of the problem. complaining to gms about isd is like complaining to police about police, or doctors about doctors.thus i come here.there is a problem and it does need a solution, even if that is just a re-direction of gsilvers efforts.when the help channel is shut down like this everyone is either gagged or leaves in disgust. you notice this as suddenly no one is answering questions except for gsilver, but then when he leaves 30mins later the helpers return.rookie help channel is one thing, it need to run in a one-line q&a format.however for most of the day the ""help"" channel functions in a way very different to this with a higher level of service including more details and discussion on how mechanics actually work. this is until gsilver gets online and ruins it.the help channel is being disrupted by this isd's actions, while gags and bans are being used in a frivolous manner."
1/6/2010,"not really - like i said, isd are volunteers, not employees. it's not like they're just working out of a different half of the gm centre, they're people who volunteer their time from home. i've looked into this a bit more, and there's a couple names you may want to contact. isd libertina is the person in charge of star(the rookie help division of isd, that gsilver works for), and ccp ginger is the volunteer manager. contact those two, and see if they can help you, or direct you to the person who can. it's a better approach for a problem of this type, and it has the advantage of not taking several months to work through the system. give that a shot, see if it helps."
1/6/2010,"i've petitioned against a pair of gm's in the past. i've only done it once, but it did yield results. action was taken. if i can get that reaction countering the actions of a couple of gm's who are actually paid staff, then you can surely get action taken against a member of the isd which is comprised of volunteers.so while it may be complaining to the police about police that doesn't mean you won't get a response you'll like. police have internal affairs departments.your issue sounds like you've found one volunteer who's on a small power trip and needs to be reined in. that or removed from his position of authority. this is not a situation for the csm to pursue. the csm functions as a legislative lobby group. rather this is a situation for the ccp police to take care of. in other words they need to support their own standards/rules of behaviour and that means you start by petitioning against the guy within game.should that fail, there is always the old fashioned customer complaint department accessed through out of game e-mail.windjammer"
1/6/2010,"the csm has no say about isd.if you think a member of isd is doing his job poorly, then you need to submit a petition in the isd category about it. the csm isn't going to be able to help you."
1/6/2010,"lordmagnus is the best magnus.ergo; not supported. it has been stated a thousand tiems a thousand times that wrecks belong to no one.even if they did, they would technically belong to the pirate faction that the ship once belonged to, and therefor they are still fair game."
1/6/2010,beat me to it...not supported.
1/6/2010,-1/10 for the troll attempt.(not supported of course)
1/6/2010,"first of all kill rights is a different mechanic from being aggroed towards someone. if you steal their loot you don't get kill rights, so why on earth would you get kill rights for salvaging wrecks (the whole idea of which implies it belong to anyone anyways).second of all if it did cause them to be aggressed towards you (which is what i think you are asking for... i hope) it wouldn't make a lick of difference. i ninja salvage occasionally, if i see loot i want i take it. meaning i'm busy sitting there agressed, salvaging and looting away, and most of the time i'm ignored, or they blow wrecks, or get scared and fly away. it's great fun.the best is when they refit to pvp and i fly back in a phoon and they warp off again..."
1/6/2010,"i cannot support this. assigning kill rights for theft is a bit over the top. however, if it was a proposal for flagging the salvage thief, that would be another matter.side note: ccp controls the mechanics of the game and they decide what is to be allowed in the game. this does not mean they have license to make unitlateral value judgements on what is wrong and what is right. members of the ccp staff can say it's not stealing all they want. it does not change the fact that it is stealing. there are a number of potential reasons for ccp to argue that ninja salvaging is not stealing and none of them have anything to do with the definition of theft save within the confines of their game mechanics. in other words it is stealing, but it is stealing that ccp currently chooses to allow.windjammerp.s. the op is in error when he says there is nothing he can do. if nothing else he can have fun blowing up the wrecks."
1/6/2010,"ccp made no value judgment, the rightness or wrongness wasn't remarked on, legality was, right and wrong are no where close to legal and illegal.what ccp is really doing for the mission runners that cant deal with ninja salvagers is allowing them to keep their ships. as soon as high sec mission runners can attack ""ninja salvagers"" we all know what would actually happen."
1/6/2010,"supportedi'm sick of these greedy little w***ers whining about this deasd horse over and over like they don't already make more isk than their risk level deserves.give them what they want, let them lose their ships to ppl who actually know how to fly and let the flood of tears commence"
1/6/2010,"you realize you can't get the salvage without specialized equipment? that's the crux of the issue. that's why salvaging is a mini-profession as much as mining, hacking, and archeology. you can run a radar site and kill all the rats, but that doesn't mean the contents of the hacking can is yours by any kind of right.the contents in the rat wreck itself is yours because regardless of your fitting, if you killed that rat, you can get that loot. there's no exceptions. all you need is space in your cargo hold.and you're going to complain about ninja-miners who are stealing the asteroids in your missions too, right?"
1/6/2010,"for this reason alone, supported!"
1/6/2010,"the terms ""theft"" and ""stealing"" are not exclusive to the realm of law, though law often attempts to define them in a contractual fashion. when someone steals from another, we identify it by whether the action in question was wrong or right. the legal system strives to either emulate right or wrong or seeks to circumvent right and wrong. thus the concept of theft cannot be left to definitions made by law. in other words it is quite possible to steal even though the law will not punish it as such.so when ccp staff say ninja salvaging is not stealing they are making a value judgment. it would be more accurate of them to say it is not illegal in eve and so no law has been broken. that would be a comment on law rather than the one they do make which is comment on value as well as law.if you believe this to be true, you should support the op's idea, though i still think he phrased it incorrectly when he said kill rights. i'm pretty sure he meant flagging similar to loot theft.finally, you don't know what would happen. what would happen is one of the reasons ccp does not want to flag ninja salvagers and why most ninja salvagers don't want to be flagged.windjammer"
1/6/2010,"and what if you didn't have enough room in your ship? what if you had to go back to station to get another ship with sufficient cargo space? not yours because you didn't have the cargo hold capacity?this also ignores mission ships that do have salvage equipment on them while doing a mission. these guys are ninja salvaged all the time because they can't get to the wreck they created before a ninja pops in and steals it.yes. though that is a less common phenomena because of the time it takes to suck up the rock and the relatively low value of most rock found in missions. the asteroids are literally created by the action of the mission runner. and, of course, the term ninja miner most often refers to an entirely different type of activitywindjammer"
1/6/2010,"the cargohold capacity is not keeping you from looting. it's simply keeping you from looting the entire mission at once. again, you don't need a special module to loot wrecks. i can loot a wreck just as easily with no modules fitted whatsoever. you can not, however, salvage with a ""naked"" ship. this is because salvaging requires a tool that not everyone has. once salvaging is built-in (like the ship's onboard scanner, for example), then we can argue about salvage ""belonging"" to you.it doesn't ignore them at all. they are free to salvage, just as i am free to warp to a belt and mine. that doesn't mean if i'm the first in the belt it belongs to me, however. hell, even if i scan out a grav site, the asteroids don't belong to me any more than they belong to the next guy who warps in.it's certainly an interesting point-of-view, but it is fairly obvious ccp doesn't agree with your ""right"" to anything in the mission. activating ""your"" mission gate is not a criminal act. killing ""your"" mission rats is not a criminal act. mining ""your"" mission asteroids is not a criminal act. this is not by accident. this is a design decision made by ccp devs long, long ago; otherwise, missions would be instanced and none of this would be an issue."
1/6/2010,^^^ this!!! hahahaha let us be flagged
1/6/2010,"oh look, it's this topic again for then f-ing bajillionth time.salvaging is a mini professionccp likes it that wayit's not going awaygive up."
1/6/2010,"just pop the wrecks. wastes their time as much as yours.what i am more concerned about is when you do get kill rights, others in your fleet don't have aggression and this is becoming a problem because a pve fit ship has absolutely no way of successfully engaging a pvp fit ship - not only that but now you can't even get a buddy to help out and chase them off? ridiculous.perhaps its a badly thought out attempt at tweaking the aggression rules to try to get people to move out of high sec missioning hubs and into low sec, which again other than the occasional one-sided engagement with a bc gate camp is pretty much devoid of any activity whatsoever."
1/6/2010,"hell with it, drop salvage altogether. no more salvage for anyone.it's like a pack of damned kids all *****ing about who got the biggest piece of cake. screw it, no cake for any of you."
1/6/2010,get rid of concord protecting ninja-salvagers sitting in noobcorps and being invulnerable. let's promote more pew-pew.
1/6/2010,not supported
1/6/2010,"you're right, it is stealing (in a way).unfortunately for the op and mission runners, it is stealing from the wreckage owner. in the case of mission runners, that would be serpentis, etc.so no, the salvagers should not be flagged toward the mr in any way shape or form for salvaging a ship.otoh, they shouldn't really be flagged toward the mr for looting from the wrecks either.. just as in pvp, the wreckage loot belongs to the owner of the ship."
1/6/2010,if you are not making enough isk running missions why don't you try ninja salvaging?
1/6/2010,"your argument is selective and ignores what makes the loot the ""property"" of the mission runner. in your argument a module, the salvage module, is what makes the loot the property of one person or the other. this ignores the module which made the wreck in the first place. turret, launcher or both.if salvaging capability were built into the ships rather than requiring a module you'd still argue in the same fashion. basing your argument on a module or lack thereof is futile.getting to a belt first or scanning a site is not what created the site or the belt. these things are created through no action of any player and because of that no single player has any claim to them. the exception to this is what's going on in 0.0 because of the dominion release, but that is an entirely different section of the game with its own unique dynamics.mission npc's are created by the action of the mission runner. he goes to an agent, requests a mission and accepts it. further, the mission runner creates the wrecks by shooting the npc's in just the same way he/she creates the loot in the wreck by that action. this is the basis for the claim of ownership. not who got to the loot or salvage first.this is simply restating and agreeing with what i've already said in post 10 of this thread. thank you for agreeing with me? again, stealing the salvage is not a criminal act, but that does not mean it isn't stealing. it simply means there is no ""law"" prohibiting the act.there was a time when killing an npc did not generate a wreck, only a loot can. and there was a time when stealing from that loot can was not a flagged offense. ccp has a long history of devs changing what they've made decisions on ""long, long ago"".regardless of what is flagged or not flagged and even what concord responds to and what they do not respond to there is one thing everyone should be able to agree upon. missions will never be a private little dungeon or as you say, ""instanced"". that would take too much interaction out of the game and ccp's overall design philosophy is interaction.if stealing salvage were flagged in the same way that stealing loot is, things would be much more interesting for mission runners and for ninja salvagers. i really do not believe that ccp will do this in the foreseeable future. they see ninja salvaging as a mini profession. in other words a beginners profession. by its very nature it is for those new to the game because it allows the beginner to gain income from something they can do with very little training. flagging the theft would expose these beginners to getting their little rumps shot off. that would discourage beginners and ccp wants to acquire beginners. more money in ccp's pocket that way.windjammer"
1/6/2010,i would have thought someone like you would be very much in favor of flagging. gives you more opportunity to bait people into attacking you.
1/6/2010,"by your line of reasoning the loot in the npc wreckage should not be flagged either as it too belongs to the npc, serpentis in your example. if that came to pass, ninja stealing would become even more profitable, the volume of bear tears would increase and missions would be nerfed. perhaps this is something you should advocate."
1/6/2010,"because a good mission runner has enough of his own wrecks to salvage, they're easier to find and he/she isn't a thief when they salvage them. it may surprise you that some care about that last part, but it is still true.windjammer"
1/6/2010,"i don't think four posts in a row is enough, try again."

1/6/2010,"sorry, guy. my research and that of my companions indicates that there is no change in the success rate of invention.that having been said, the time for removal of t2 bpo's from the game has come with the release of dominion. which is odd coming from me as not more than a year ago i would not have supported a removal of t2 bpo's. the key to my change of heart can be found in the sheer amount of material now needed for t2 production.dominion's release greatly increased the volume of material needed to make a single t2 item. this means that those well researched t2 bpo's with their high me's are kicking the crap out of anybody that invents. this on top of the existing advantages (i.e. not having datacores as an overhead) make the t2 bpo way overpowered and capable of taking over markets by undercutting those who must invent while still making a decent profit.no way for inventors to compeat = severe imbalance.windjammer"
1/6/2010,"atm there is nothing in a pos to repair your ships.i know there is a way to put shiprepping modules in your hangar. but switching out is a pain.the modules.one could either create a module that:reps al kinds of damage, one at a time. (ex. first hull then armor, then shields)one module with add-ons (one for each rep type).or 3 seperate modules (one for each rep type).these modules can either be seperate modules to put in the pos bubble, but that might crowd it.another option is add/ build 1 all-rep module, or in the other case 3 seperate modules to your tower.how to use it?operating ranges for the module can depend on the size of the tower. this to make it impossible to rep ships that are constantly moving in and out of the shield to attack and rep. there should be a considerable distance covered from the shield to the max rep distance. it could also be limited to battleship size max. or the hitpoints repped could be decent for a bs but meaningless for capital ships.for large towers the module can have a lock and operating range of 2000m unmanned.or manned from 3 to 6 km depending on skills.it can only rep ships inside the pos and needs to be installed at close range from the pos tower.or as mentioned above it could be an add-on module for the pos tower?mentioned ranges can vary, the ones mentioned are merely examples.when there is nobody in the pos that can man the module the pilot manipulates the module to rep his own ship. he moves his ship within 2500m of the module and chooses ""rep my ship"" from the list.when somebody wants to man it, it works like the pos guns.skills can be added too the corporation skill list.a basic in-pos repping skill increasing the rep range.lvl 1 to be able to self rep (unmanned).lvl 4 needed to man it and rep other ships.also needs anchoring 4 or 5.an advanced skill increasing the rep amount.needs anchoring 5 and ""rep range"" 5.depending on factors the dev's may come up with it can be from 5% up to 10% per level.my 2c."
1/6/2010,"logistic ships, carriers and nanite repair paste is all you need.having a module like that would make it too easy to repair in hostile space.why would you fight over stations with repair service if you can just have the same on the pos for free? also it would make living in wh space too easy.wh space is meant to be tough.that said ... i cant really support it."
1/6/2010,"fair enough.there is not always somebody around that can fly a carrier, logistics or anything else for that matter. and you can't repair your shield, armor, hull with repair paste. so you are doomed to go through the module switching.best regards,s"
1/6/2010,there is a reason i pack a cruiser for whs ops.... one fitted with various remote reppers....it's not an impossible feat.... and it doesn't need to be logistics.it's called using your head. :)
1/6/2010,"this would be quite convenient, but give it severe limitations, like only one per pos and only able to rep one person at a time slowly. also make it able to rep drones."
1/6/2010,"ok you can't hear anything in space, as there is no air to transmit sound.so why am i bombarded with random garbled crap at every gate?if that's what is on your ships radio wouldn't you change the station?now this even occurs at mission acceleration gates.amarr station sounds are horrible.(i purposely find a non-amarr station for my ship spinning pleasure)and i don't know if it's just me, but does it seem like just when they get the sound to a tolerable level they release a new patch and someone at ccp takes it upon themselves to jack the volume on station sounds and gates back up to a ridiculous level.(i can count five times this has happened.)just give us volume control please. don't care to hear broken garbled radio chatter"
1/6/2010,supported - and i'd also like to hear the sounds from my missions please. guns go boom...then..silent. -.-
1/6/2010,"i support this, and want to add that we really need an option to turn off ""positional sound effects"", so we finally can hear our turrets firing, enemy lasers shooting, ship explosions and all that again, as it used to be pre-apocrypha."

1/6/2010,"this. what an awful, terrible idea."
1/6/2010,since the changes in dominion the prices of the hulk class mining barge have skyrocketed due to changes in construction requirements as well as mineral instability. think ccp should revert the hulk bp to pre dominion stats at least untill ore prices stabalize. mining has never been as profitable or as much of an isk sink as missioning and these changes have just made mining even less apealing. in my opinion ccp owes miners alot. but the least they can do is make a few small changes to the blueprints so that hulks are once again affordable and easier to produce.
1/6/2010,no.
1/6/2010,oh yes please-cj
1/6/2010,"it would be nice if the search box on your hanger included the item type in it's results.for example, if i type 'drone' into the search at the moment i get things like ""drone control unit i"" but no actual drones. if the item group was included in the search then 'drone' would still show the ""drone control unit i"" but would also include all actual drones in my hanger. it also follows that i can then be more specific and search for 'combat drones' or 'missile launcher' etc.can't think of any down side really :-)-cj"
1/6/2010,there's an existing thread regarding this proposal here.
1/6/2010,"poses were all good when people didn't rely on them as their homes. people would erect poses in empire space or space where they have sovereignty in order to perform various functions... but the owners would go to an outpost to dock up for the night.since apocrypha introduced the element of wormhole space, people have been finding and -- and making homes of -- these new uncharted, unclaimed, dangerous locations in unknown reaches of space. the problem is, these people can't rely on ccp-generated outpost stations that they can dock in where they can take advantage of services -- some differing between different stations, some being basic functions that all stations have -- to support their ships and inventory. a lot of these things are covered by various objects that can be anchored inside a pos... but a lot of these things aren't, and even the things that are available in poses sometimes don't work correctly or are just a major pain in the ass. being somebody whose corp lives and operates in wormhole space, i find it necessary to outline the various stupid things that we have to deal with due to the pos, and ask that they be somehow resolved in a not-unbalanced manner.""new"" proposalsshield chargingone of the seemingly-fundamental problems with poses is that you never dock your ship while you are in it. to explain further, your skills are not realized as far as ship specifications until the ship is undocked and in space and then you board it. i don't do armor tanking, so i can't reliably say whether armor will fill up when you step into it, but as for my buffer-tanked drake, because my shield management skill and the various shield buffer modules and rigs are not taken into account until i board the ship, the shield amount will remain what it was before the buffer was added (it will usually be about 40% of total) and i have to wait for it to charge before i can do anything. i don't know the best way to resolve this problem... perhaps the addition of repair modules for poses, or maybe cut the shield recharge time (and capacitor too?) by 1/3 while within the forcefield?personal hangarsi don't know if this is something i can ever expect to see, but a personal division in corporate hangar arrays (or maybe a new pos fitting that's specialized for providing a personal hangar to everybody) would be fantastic. it's very hard to keep track of what's yours in a hangar array, and it's even harder when somebody thinks that pile of artillery is theirs (when they accidentally left theirs in jita), you go to pick up more ammo and then find that it's gone.docked ship cargo/drone accessfairly self-explanatory. i'd like to be able to access cargoholds of ships that are currently stored in the ship maintenance array.problemsships don't store properly in ship maintenance arraysometimes, when you board a ship that's in the ship array, the ship you're currently in will not store itself. that is a big problem, because you have to wait out the session timer so you can board the improperly-stored ship, wait out the session timer so you can store it, and then wait out the session timer so you can board the ship you actually want to fly. poses with more than a few modules are hard enough to get out of without vacant ships sitting around.starbase fuel technicians don't receive low fuel warningsself-explanatory. they really should receive those.that's about all i can think of off the top of my head... feel free to add more. don't forget to check the ""support this topic"" box, even if you only support a couple points."

1/7/2010,"well the csm failed to find a solution to the hybrid weapon system problems. this was mostly due to a poorly written wiki that linked to a third party website wich could be edited at any time.to that end i'm gonna throw together what should of been in the wiki herehybrid weapons are underpowered due to several factors. to keep things simple i'll seperate both problems into blasters and into railguns.<blasters>> they suffer from very short range with only 10% more dps than pulse lasers which have 3x the range* range should not be adjusted as this is a drawback of blasters > base damage of blasters must be increased to bring back the ""extreme close range"" advantage that blasters are supposed to have. the old gallante saying of ""wait till i get in range"" no longer applies as it is laughed at by everyone saying ""i can kill you long before you get in range"".> although off topic, the set of blaster boats need to be revised but should be done with reference and balance to a blaster overhaul. > whilst at the range they are supposed to excell at they suffer from poor tracking due to the tracking formula being too simple. people say that this is a piloting problem however having to reduce your transversal to be able to hit means that you become an easier target too rendering using short range weapons to ""get under the guns"" of longer range weapons pointless.> an extension to the tracking problem is attempting get into that ""sweet spot"" which is extremely small (less than 500m difference either way)> a boost to tracking however needs to be thoroughly balanced and tested to prevent megathron pilots being able to hit an af pilot.> a damage boost to overloading blasters has been suggested. i like the idea but needs to be thoroughly looked into.> ammo types of blasters needs a revision (not to change damage types, therm/kin is here to stay. different ammo types should offer real advantages in different fields instead of mostly just different optimal range)<railguns>> railguns don't seem to have any identity. they have horrifying tracking, poor dps and only moderate range> t2 ammo needs revision however is a separate topic> any suggestions to railgun improvements because i'm struggling for good ideas that have reasonable advantages and drawbacks.hybrids in general have no real advantage over other weapons systems. the prime evidence for this is the fact that people tend to be happy to fit unbonused weapons systems to ships over their bonused hybrid weapons systems. [laser ferox] [laser lachesis] although it doesn't have a hybrid bonus[projectile myrmidon] i'm sure there are more.i would never personally fit hybrid weapons to ships that get a bonus to projectile/lasers."

1/7/2010,"guns have optimal+falloff/tracking/sig radiusmissiles have moderate damage up to max range/explosion velocity/sig radius.fighting with missiles is different to fighting with guns, but its not possible to always get the max damage down on a target as you seem to think.and ^^ that has no bearing on the relationship between skill lvl's and damage due to damage type selection.you seem hung up on the fact that amarr in this case or you could as easily say gallente cant switch damage types.well last i lookedlight neut ii ( therm/kin ) has 30% more dps than ac's ( damage choice ).medium pulse ( em/therm ) has 10% more dps and vastly supperior optimal than ac's ( damage choice ).being able to choose damage type comes with the penalty of lower raw dps.yes missiles do full damage out to there max range , but missile max damage is not comparable to gun max damage , gun max damage being considerable more.back to the point of the post.amarr pilots choose ammo based on engagement range, lvl 5 pilots get 25% more dps whatever ammo they choose.gallente pilots choose ammo based on engagement range , lvl 5 pilots get 25% more dps whatever ammo they choose.minmatar pilots choose ammo based on resistance holes , lvl 5 pilots get 25% more dps whatever ammo they choose.caldari cmb pilots choose ammo based on resistance holes , lvl 5 pilots only get 25% bonus over lvl1 pilots in 1/3 engagements when kin is optimal in 2/3rd engagements the ""damage bonus"" is wasted , effectivelly making a lvl5 pilot no more effective than a lvl1 pilot.this game is a rpg where skills and the training time spent on them are supposed to count for something.unfortunettly for cmb pilots , ccp ""borrowed"" the damage bonuses on cmb's to provide caldari with the kinetic flavour , rather than putting it into the ammo like was done with the other races.5% to one ammo type is considerable less effective than a 5% bonus to the weapon system that fires it.if one , two , three races get 5% bonuses to racial weapons systems , then the 4th race should also get 5% bonuses to racial weapons systems. otherwise it really only leave 3 races worth looking at for pvp.hmmm , i wonder why so many people prefer guns and gun races for pvp ?so hard to join the dots isnt it ?lets have 25% bonuses on cmb's like other races."

1/7/2010,"where did i say i think that ? i am a missile user, i'm fully aware of this.guns do sub optimal damage at large portions of their range (range adversely affects dmg)missiles do full damage across their entire range (range does not adversely affect dmg)guns hit/miss their target depending on angular velocity/sig radius of target missiles do more/less damage depending on explosion velocity/sig radius of targetso in the range game, missiles win and in the sig radius game, both guns and missiles have a downside.the reason i pointed to the range issue with minnies is because, as ccp have said before, ""minmatar fight in falloff""... in other words, minmatar fight at sub optimal dps, perhaps not all the time, but enough to justify having the switchable damage. while not 100% exclusive to minmatar, the sheer prevalence of split (read unbonused) weapons in minmatar hulls is yet more weight behind my point.i agree some caldari hulls need some help, but, a blanket approach is not the answer, a fact sadly lost on ccp when they looked at minmatar recently. you'll notice that people are not flying significantly more cyclones and bellicoses now, they are still mostly flying ruptures and hurricanes (albeit a few more of them sporting artillery)your proposed change would have much the same affect, in short it would do little to encourage pppl to fly currently underused caldari hulls and merely reinforce the dominance of hulls such as the drake and the cerb."

1/7/2010,"it's a minor point, but i can't think of anything it could possibly break, so supported."
1/7/2010,"so let me see if i understand your position correctly. you posit that in the status quo, field command ships are usable and effective, to the point where you make pvp videos with the one that basically everyone but you regards as the worst of the four, and still manage a good amount of success. you simultaneously claim that field command ships have inadequate bonuses, and need to be made into elite gang-boost ships with bonuses that no other ship class - including the ones specifically designed for the purposes of boosting fleets - can touch. your rationale for this, looking at the thread linked in the op, seems to consist entirely of the fact that they have the word ""command"" in their name. you proceed to make incoherent references to tier-2 battlecruisers, saying that the astarte is supposed to be a myrmidon variant, and talk about how ccp needs to either give them an incoherent and overly complex bonus that you made up with no regard for game design or balance, or they need to acknowledge that they are ""assault"" battlecruisers, which is exactly what they have been for the last five years, and which is a role that they are spectacularly well-suited for. do i have that right?"
1/7/2010,"they are usable and effective, but they are to be even more usable and even more effective. you've got this right, i suppose. btw, i guess i can make a movie featuring almost any ship, but this won't make the ship itself become any better than it is. i guess i could fly tech1 battlecruisers, but that would be extremely low-risk and thus boring. you can't claim something is fine (i.e. field cs) just by the fact someone likes to use it.please, don't pull statements out of the thin air, as i have never said anything of astarte as myrmidon's variation.acknowledging command ships as assault battlecruisers requires you to take a closer look at the entire tech1/tech2 classes, that's right, too. in some cases - as stated - the difference is not distinctive enough. again, as stated, this difference became dim with the introduction of tier2 battlecruisers, marauders and black ops. field command ships were well-suited for their intended role. i want them to recover their former majesty. balance shifts happen now and then and we should respond to those.but...... a sheer tank and spank (assault class) is pretty boring itself, that's why i proposed something unique."
1/7/2010,no.1) command ships role is that of sustained gang boosters. changing the bonus to a short them even if larger boost will greatly degrade the value in fleet operations. 2) a short therm boost will make the shield capacity gang link totally useless.
1/7/2010,"1) that's exactly why it's a good proposal. blobs don't need any boosting, small-scale pvp needs it. fleets still could use fleet command ships, so what's the problem here?2) wtb one."
1/7/2010,"oh, of course they could be. the question is whether that's actually the right call for game balance, or whether you're just trying to buff the ship you fly. true, but you're also in this thread saying that it's a very good ship, which makes me think that the movie was about more than just taking a little-used ship and having fun with it. i oversimplified a bit, but in your other thread, you talked about how the only reason people don't hate the astarte is that the myrm is a drone ship. that implies that someone might possibly have some reason to compare the two by default, which is just ludicrous. the eos is the myrm-like, the astarte is the brutix-like. other than for deciding which you want to fly, there is no conceivable reason to even suggest that they should be compared. it'd be like me saying that the only reason the drake looks good is because the erebus does something completely different. i suppose i wouldn't directly be comparing them, but it certainly begs the question of why you're raising even the possibility of comparison. buffer-tank mwd fits, t2 gear and t1 rigs, all-v skills:harbinger: 678 dps, 63k ehp, 896 m/sabsolution: 786 dps, 105k ehp, 922 m/sdrake: 414 dps, 92k ehp, 1038 m/snighthawk: 572 dps, 88k ehp, 1038 m/s(note: both these are heavy missile fits, so they're not especially comparable to the other three races)brutix: 743 dps, 52k ehp, 924 m/sastarte: 938 dps, 74k ehp, 941 m/shurricane: 733 dps, 45k ehp, 1161 m/ssleipnir: 837 dps, 60k ehp, 1475 m/s, gang linkyou were saying? i don't find afs, hacs, bcs, field commands, or bses to be boring classes. they're less wacky than a stealth bomber, but really, most classes are built around a particular role, whether that role is dps, rr, ew, gang boosts, or whatever else. the four t2 cruiser classes are all very different, but i don't consider one to be more or less interesting than the other three - they all have a role, they're all good at their role, and their roles all fit nicely into broader issues of game design. every mmo needs a few dps classes - they may be ""boring"", but they're fine. overall, i think you're falling into the trap of assuming that interesting game design is inherently good game design. your goal shouldn't be wacky stuff, your goal should be elegant design. what you've proposed is an ugly, unnecessary kludge that destroys a perfectly good ship class. yes, it's a bit more ""interesting"", but it's far worse for the game. step back and look at the big picture."

1/7/2010,"this is downright stupid. you cannot bad punish for a law that isn't public. if it is a punishable offense, it needs to be clearly stated somewhere that it is such. we have laws that state that stealing and murder is illegal. if someone does read the law and go ""that's cool, i'm gonna try it"" their is a jail system in place. we do not (or at least should not in most states) have hidden laws, that next law a businessmen find himself a jail for a market manipulation that ""offends the society and harms the economic system"". if it's bannable offence, their needs to be a clear definition of it, and preferably a list. people have given above a large number of examples. someone kept saying htat buying ships, insuring them and poping them for 2 mill of insurance money is a bannable offense. hteir are tons of examples. it needs to be made clear."
1/7/2010,"i support this.a list of exploits doesn't necessarily need to be exhaustive, but some better guidelines as to what players should report would be very helpful.i think the danger of more people performing exploits is actually fairly minimal - you don't need to specify every detail of an exploit in the list (as stated already), and if people do start (or carry on) with exploits when they're in the list i'd say that's an even more clear-cut case for a warning/ban."
1/7/2010,"i offer this up: is there a list of exploits?pos bowling - for the majority of the time the mechanics of the game allowed this to happen, gms had differing opinions on whether or not it was an exploit. then they all agreed it was legal because they couldn't police it. when they eventually all agreed it was an exploit, the devs fixed it in a patch a month later. so, this exploit list would have existed for a month in that case.if pos bowling is your example of what you think needs to be fixed, then what you want is not allowing gms to make judgment calls on exploits. besides, as far as i know, gms only issued warnings, so this is a bad example.i recall another exploit where warnings were passed out (second warning got you a temp ban) that was later fixed - agressing someone with an alt, ejecting from that ship, jumping into it with you main, then jumping the main character back into his normal ship. this would lead to a bug where the person you had aggressed would see your main as blinking (like they had rights to shoot), but he wasn't. this too was fixed shortly after warnings started being dished out.as far as i know, such ""ongoing exploits"" which are known but not fixed yet are very rare, so this ""exploit list"" you ask for would normally have nothing on it (other than afk macros).most exploit warnings/penalties were dished out after the fix, and those have been for things very very clearly an exploit (with the exception of the two i just listed).short and simple is gms give a warning first for most simple things. huge things usually lead to emergency patches once devs/gms learn about them. the only exception to this rule is afk macros."

1/7/2010,"good day all,e-z version: for the masses,missions=> after you clear a room of all enemies, you become able to bookmark that space, to come back later without passing all gates again. scanning and gating mechanics remain otherwise unchanged. alternatively, and for the love of god only as an alternative, as in, if not bookmarks, allow micro warp drivesgraphics=> add 2d graphics like sparks, shells, shield and armor and hull impacts. these would be client side and toggleable!great!scroll down for the complete version.honorable council of stellar management, fellow capsuleers, i wanted to write about some issues, but first i'd like to make a brief introduction.i like eve online very much, and have played it for almost 2 years with as many as three accounts.my main activity is running missions, because it's the aspect of the game that i enjoy above the others.i have invited several friends, who play online games regularly, but for hard that i tried, i wasn't able to make any of them stick to eve after their trials. the main causes of this, and the reason for this proposal are the following:- acceleration gates and bookmarks. simply put, during a mission, if you bookmark anywhere in the deadspace, you will not be able to warp back in if you leave the mission when you go to work, or simply log off for whatever other reason. if you try to warp to said bookmark, you'll end up at the first mission gate. this is annoying, and unnecessary.please note: that same spot will be automatically and magically accessible once you complete the mission.- micro warp drives. simply put, the majority of the missions in which you need speed, because of travel times, number of enemies, etc., you won't be allowed to use mwds. annoying, and unnecessary.- graphical flair, poor combat impact effects. simply put, the fact that all weapons hit the same mysterious inner middle spot in every ship is a turn-off for some of the people i showed the game to.because of the above, i respectfully propose that our kind people at ccp:- allow warp-in to an acceleration gate mission spot, for example only after said spot has been cleared of enemies. there's ample proof that mission running people would accept this, regardless of space security, to avoid the annoying and boring waiting and travel times connected with the current acceleration gate ""logics"".- allow the use of mwds in mission deadspace. this will for example open up many new ways to play missions (after not much in fact you'll end up playing the same ones, so it'll add variety)- enrich fights graphics with 2d detail, ricochet and particles to the fights. for example, regarding detail, projectile weapons would litter the space with used shells, hybrids would release casings, missiles would release flying guides and lasers would leave dust coulds behind.regarding ricochet, hits should be absorbed with some graphical effect, to the extent that the very projectile 2d figure might stay floating around the ship, or that the shield and armor and hull might display a little focused explosion, or similar effect.regarding particles, at the moment only missile explosions produce some kind of particles upon hit. it'd be surely nice to see similar effects applied to other weapon types.i believe that all players will benefit from these additions, that enrich gameplay and user experience.thanks for your time."
1/7/2010,"done intentionally for multiple reasons. it slows down the amount of income generated in the mission. mission running is the most profitable profession in the game and making it better would further damage an economy dominated by components and materials gathered by mission runners.again, done intentionally for the same reason as above.it would be nice to have this fixed and also have missiles not spout from the core of the ship so i cant disagree. i am not a programmer or developer but making both of these a client side function would seem relatively simple imho."
1/7/2010,yes!
1/7/2010,"for all the hostility towards this topic, there's really only 3 outcomes.1) ccp leaves it alone, doing nothing.2) ccp makes sm, med, lg, xl, cap, t1, named, t2, faction, officer, complex...3) ccp takes the ""small"" off the front, and the ""i"" off the end, and calls them ""tractor beam"" or ""capital tractor beam""."
1/7/2010,or a strategic cruiser.
1/7/2010,"well, we got a salvager ii already, why not a tractor beam ii as well? 30km range, something in between capital and small tech1."
1/7/2010,"needs the details to be tight to avoid scamming and of course the risk vs. reward needs to be balanced, but in general i like this."
1/7/2010,"what happens if someone wants to put a bounty on ppl who shoot at a pos? the owning corp/alliance should have some means to facilitate a bounty contract on ppl killing the pos.when does the bounty hunter get back the collateral? after one succesfull kill or after the whole bounty amount is claimed?this will complicate things and slow down the flow of business.so with high enough skills a hunter can have multiple live contracts on a single target and claim a multiplicative amount after each kill?so one character gets killed a few times and puts up bounty contracts, if there is enough collateral in then the target just docks up for one week and they keep the collateral?great isk sink. the money is taken from the bounty contract instead of the insurance corp. ccp will love the idea to withdraw isk from circulation. so the 10mil one pays to setup a contract is out of economy in that instance. (except if there is a pod kill, but with the fixed 10mil amount you will dry it on the ship kill on almost anything bigger then a cruiser)good idea, the details require some work."
1/7/2010,"heh, yeah it does fix the abuse of the current systems quite well and it doesn't include complete denial of insurance to those under a bounty as some embittered carebears have been touting around this forum the last few days. so sure, from this perspective i could support it.is anyone actually going to take it up ? well if their motivation is isk, certainly not. a week spent hunting the same guy to get a few cruisers worth of bounty is a very very poor rate of return on the effort put in, let alone the risk so i would say almost nobody would do it for financial gain. if concord sanctioned targets is the motivation, wardecks are more efficient by a very very wide margin.in short, great solution to the mechanic abuse, but no, nobody is actually going to do it./shrug"
1/7/2010,"supported (with adjustment) - and surely that adjustment always comes when it reaches serious discussion and development stage.regardless, bounty hunting in eve can add so much more to the community if done right. currently it's a joke. this should be brought to the csm/ccp table for further refinement discussion and i support this wholeheartedly."
1/7/2010,"i think the major difference is that drones are meant as a secondary weapon system - every primary weapon system uses a high slot. drone boats emphasize this more than others and i think that they could do with a boost but i think that it is never going to happen...mainly due to mission runners. somebody can easily fit a decent domi tank pull all aggro and afk to the next acceleration gate while the drones do the dirty work. repeat and rinse thats afk money and amounts to the same effect as macro mining...it is bad at the moment but being able to increase the afk damage you can do would only worsen the amount of people doing it.and as a side note...you have been using a neut domi and amarr ship as examples but in a straight out fight dps abaddon vs neut domi the neut domi would win more often than not as the abaddon's only hope is outdpsing your tank just before his cap runs out...because of your free highs.don't get me wrong...i'm in full support of this, but realistically i don't think the devs will allow it without some other major changes to drones ie. removing the aggresive setting, which would require a major patch and probably a complete overhaul. which i doubt will take priority over what they consider more important issues in the game."
1/7/2010,"one argument is how people say drones don't take up powergrid, they don't take high slots etc. but their damage is fixed. dps from 5 heavy drones in a dominix is about half of what some other systems can easily achieve. i don't see it as overpowered to give them a module or implants or rigs that increase this a little bit. keep in mind these will all stack together just as any other damage modules and rigs. not op. justified!your amarr ship vs neut dommi is a very very close minded approach to this. ships that are buffer fit and use almost no cap will have almmost no hinderance from the neuts and would slaughter the dommi, you have to look at the wider picture. just because a neut dommi is good at killing a cap intensive ship doesn't mean it's overpowered."

1/7/2010,"personally, when i did, i missioned in caldari space where the bounties are higher and the loot and salvage is abysmal...so if you want to spend the time to scan me down and salvage and/or loot the wrecks that i am leaving anyway for at most 1/4 of what i am earning more power to you. i understand that there's a certain feel of ownership but you may also have that feeling over your ship and if other people choose to take that from you you won't have that either"

1/7/2010,stealing salvage does flag the thief with an agro counter.now if i could just figure out why you jetcanned your salvage....
1/7/2010,"i challenge you to find strong evidence support that assertion that isn't some cherry-picked bs parroted ad nauseam from tabloids, and as for the rest of the post it actually made my head hurt from the backwards logic contained therein.on how to fix insurance - well, adjusting the payout so it's never more than the cost of the hull would be a good start. how often do you get more than the value of your car after totalling it in an accident?"
1/7/2010,"supported. all areas and ways of living in the game should have some risk. currently there is none in suicideganking.easiest fix that i can see would be removing insurance payouts for concord-killed ships. another options might be serious hitpoint buffs to hauler ships or nerfs to typical suicideganking ships but those are bad since they would have way more balancing issues and effects on the game. also, it would not to fix the core problem with suicide ganking: even if you fail at it, you'll lose almost nothing, while if you succeed, you win everything and the losing side has no practical ways to defend himself or fight back.a complete overhaul of the insurance system would be better of course, but i don't see it happening in the near future..."
1/7/2010,i'll support this if we are allowed to have a realistic chance to evade concord and fight back since irl we don't have pwn police. also one status hit for that 15 min timer. since were being realistic and all. oh and realistoc response to. i mean can't have insta spawn on blinky can we.
1/7/2010,"absolutely. and since we're being realistic, how about concord locks the high sec jump gates against people with < -5.0 security status, since the empires don't want galactic criminals in their space.i mean since we're being realiztic and all.(see, i can play that game too.)"
1/7/2010,"i have to say it's ridiculous when a guy can throw away a battleship and lose only a few million isk. a decent compromise would be that insurance is removed, but you could still get the 40% default payout. this would reduce the shock of going from losing only a few mil to losing the entire cost of the ship. i'm all for suicide ganking, but i think it's too easy as it stands."
1/7/2010,"if it ceased to be an exploit to evade concord, rr bs fleets would rule high sec.to the person who thinks locking a gate would prevent this, you are horribly mistaken. an rr bb fleet could stay in jita indefinitely.insurance needs an overhaul. however, you are asking for yet another nerf to suicide ganks, which already require pretty specific target selection - the dramatic loss of standing means people would be wasting standing hitting something useless."
1/7/2010,"here again you have to be with 2...1 with the remote reps and the ship that needs repairing.the idea is to have an installation that is dedicated to repping so you can do it alone without having to drag shipmodules back and forth for the internal reppers.in combat situations, ships can then be repped inside the pos and go back out to fight faster then they can now.and i also do agree that there need to be limitations."
1/7/2010,"being that remote hull rep is a right, nigh unused pain in the backside, it would certainly be handy to have a support facility like this one.it'd also encourage folks to continue residing in wh space, admittedly. whether that's a plus or a minus is a moot point, though."
1/7/2010,"i like this, though it will need to be balanced by requiring minerals and/or only capable of repairing structure damage. load up it's bay with a proportion of minerals (or perhaps a new commodity item; nanite repair blocks, anyone? narbs!) and it'll get to work on your ship for you."
1/7/2010,"why not have a module tha consumes minerals in order to repair ships and modules? ofcource you can bring a bunch of remote-reps with logistics, but i cannot see any reason why having a pos module like this, that makes life easier, would be a bad thing."
1/7/2010,"although i was indeed courteous enough to read the rest... i could have easily stopped here.you're in a pos. anchor a ship maint array, and swap modules if you're hurting. while you're inside the shield, you don't need that dcu or that webber. so swap those out for armor and hull reppers, and let them mend. while those are working, your shields are naturally regenerating on their own too.when its all fixed, swap back out again, and go about your business.otherwise, what you're asking for, will only receive the same criticism that ""station hugging"" does today.fight, fight, fight... duck under the shield (inside the station), run the repper (pay a repair bill), then head back out for more pewpew.just use the ship modules. there are a great many things ccp needs to add to the game, but lazy man's reppers are not among them."
1/7/2010,i would suggest a repair bay addition to the sma that works like an sma but repairs any ship and drones / sentries / fighters / fighter bombers put inside over time. this would use a varient of repair paste. thus local reps can still be used for fast repairs. if the paste is made player makeable from bpos sold on the market then it provides another consumable resource.
1/7/2010,friendly bump
1/7/2010,1
1/7/2010,hp buff or docking!
1/7/2010,"a reasonable request. i fly a carrier, but as this was an unintended consiquence of buffing titans and removing the mom buff there is no reason not to implement a short term fix."
1/7/2010,"i can see where some would have trouble.the message ""jim bob is attempting to warp scramble you"" usually doesn't appear when its a mission rat. i only see that message when its a player jamming.also, if you have your overview sorted differently, like by size or distance or whatever... it's possible you just can't see the jamming ship. not all of us tie up every inch of screen real estate with windows. sometimes, we like to see the pretty graphics too.it wouldn't be too hard to make a little menu option, so everyones isn't forced to see it. but it could have all the regular systems listed.sensors (targeting range/resolution)engines (webbed)warp drive (scram)capacitor (cap balance)could just be red/green or red/yellow/green or whatever. for instance, if your cap is stable at 45%, then it'd be red at first, then yellow around 65, then green at 45.i agree there are signals in the game already. but they aren't always as clear as they could be.besides, i don't think you can sort your overview to have ew spring to the top... that might be a simple fix too."
1/7/2010,"if you are new, you will not even have the icon space on the overview, most possibly. it is pityfully easy to miss this important action.it'd be good to have a specific, separate area for a ""my ship effects"" overlay, where you see real time data likedamage being dealt, effects being dealt, shield net recharge, repair net value, for example."
1/7/2010,its kind of hard to see on my overview. i am not sure but i think you might be able to set up your overview so the background of people using ewar on you is changed. so you can set it so that people scrambling you have a purple background. if you can't do that it would be nice if you could. that way you could quickly figure out who to get away from if you want to gtfo.
1/7/2010,"postulate : the actual bounty system is inneficientidea : refont the bounty system to create a new ""bounty hunter"" proffession, and real interactivity in piratry by using the killright function.1. so, u just get killed by a pirate, you have a killright, and wanna revenge?2. solution : giving an option to pay for revenge : this will cost you some isk, and increase the killright time3. expanded solution : giving the opportunity to extend the killright to others people, and/or to sell the killright to proffessionnal bounty hunter or bounty hunter corps.3. give the opportunity to the agressor to defend himself : if he's attacked by them who have a killright, give him the right to respond, but not to attack first, and for his defender too4. give the opportunity for the pirate to pay wingmens (his corporation, or independant podders or corporations), but its increasing his bounty.5. make the killright end by differents solutions : time elapsed (the killright expire for all his pursuivers) ; pay for his debt ( the pirate can make an arrangement with his pursuivers, but he need to pay at least the ammount of the bounty, shared between all his pursuivers)make his pursuivers abandon the bounty : by damaging them so hard that they will ridraw their killright, and the last : the amount of the losses of the pirate = the ammount of the bounty, so the killright expire.how can we make this?we need to define the basic ammount of isk to extend the killright time, then the ammount to engage other capsulers to attack/protect the target.then the isk cost to sell the killright to others, and the cost for each member of a corporation wich join the ""search and destroy"" mission.how improve it ?make a windows like factionnal warfare, where you can find bounty contracts, ask to join, propose to pay your own bounty... etc...make sure a pirate dont know exactly who is searching for him, if he want to pay his debt, all the pursuivers will get the message, but he will not know who receive it.each time isk is paid to extend the killrights, its added to the bounty... but each time you defend yourself (if you are the pirate) each losse you and your defenders do will reduce the bounty on your head.each time the pirate or his defenders have losses from the bounty hunter, the ammount of losses goes into the pocket of the bounty hunter who made the losses, and its deducted to the ammount of the bounty.err...i think its all for the moment, just add your comments.best regards,ramon wilco"

1/7/2010,"this has been brought up about a hundred times before. you have basically invited yourself for public ridicule in what amounts to the eve town square.while i personally support the idea of removing insurance for both concord involvement and self-destruction, there are numerouns threads on the topic in the assembly hall and your support would be better served bumping one of those than by starting a new one.for example, this one: another thread on the topic"
1/7/2010,"one of the major perks to eve imo is that there is no ranking system (levels). your judged on your capability to do a job, and tbh i don't need certificates and ranks to say that i can, cause some people with those prereqs still suck at what there rank claims they can do.in the end experience speaks loudly over 'rank'bad idea"

1/7/2010,"maybe it has nothing to do with it being easier for new players to obtain but rather something they decided should be easier to obtain for everyone, not just new players. it's called balancing game dynamics. has absolutely nothing to do with older or newer players. and btw that skill your complaining about having taken to lv5 still has a benefit to you for being lv5. if the old requirement had you taking battleship construction to lv5 which is useless past lv1 iirc, then i would completely agree with you that you got shafted but energy management 5 gives you benefits (and to the other guy complaining about survey 5 so does it)."

1/8/2010,"dav, you completely dismissed 9/10 of my argument and focused on a little snip of my argument which really doesn't even have to do with this topic. that kinda tells me you have nothing to say to my real argument....so much for proving me wrong allll the time i said why should ccp make this change knowing that it would cause unbalance in just as many ships as it would balance? they should never make a change knowing that it will cause unbalance and that more changes would be needed.you kinda ignored that and then just made a list of some stupid damage thing that everybody knows, and it really pointless.edit: you said missiles do mediocre damage at their range...if i recall, missiles actually have the potential to do some pretty impressive damage numbers....."
1/8/2010,"no i picked up on the last point you made , because you had ignored the fact that all other ammo's in game get 25% damage bonuses.the other 2 parts to your post was some argument you were having with someone else and looked a long way off topic.you are assuming that ships would become unbalanced there no evidence for that.if your refereing to drake then i'd have to say so what , caldari have one ship thats best in class. omfg its the end of the world.its not like other races dont have there uber ships.vaga. thrasher. sabre. rupturemega. taranis.revelation.according to what you have said in other post you dont even use missiles in pvp.so you have a bad case of eft maxnumberitis imo."
1/8/2010,"an argument that one blanket fix did not work is not an argument for saying caldari must be stuck with poor bonuses for ever more.iirc. the amarr fix was a blanket fix , 10%em from all armor , 10%exp from all shields. and that worked.in fact by your definition any change made to the game that affects all ships is therefore a blanket fix and shouldnt be allowed. so what are you saying that from now on only individual ships can have there stats tweeked and no other issues may be looked at ?everything you say about missile/gun combat is largelly correct and i never meant to imply you dont understand , just that you were looking at pro's and cons without stating all pro's and cons.the only point in your post i take acception to is this bit""so in the range game, missiles win""this assumes that a gun user cant maintain his optimal.if so and he loses then he lost because he ship design was not good enough.missiles only win at the range game if they can stay out of the optimal of gun users when fighting them.consider this.lets assume that a ship x a cmb is balanced against ship y a gunboat at player lvl1.they are balanced after taking into consideration all aspect of eve combat.tracking/falloff/gun power versus missile power sig radius speed , whatever other variable you want to throw into the mix.now if ship x has a damage bonus and that bonus is worth 1.6% dps per leveland ship y has a damage bonus and that bonus is worth 5% dps per level.the cmb's fall behind in the balance stacks , it is inevitable.the only way to bring balance is for damaged bonused ship to have bonuses of equal value.it is the bonus ( kinetic 5% ) a poor bonus that makes balancing cmb's impossible at all player levels.no amount of individual tweaks can fit that.for a kinetic only bonus to be equivelent in value to a 5% dpl or rof bonus it would need to be set at a level that when avergared out over all possible encounters would equal a ship with 25% more firepower.i can only guess at what that level would be lets say its 10% per level more kinetic.if its that high then mini t2 and armor tankers would be screwed facing caldari mb'sthe only option to improve the bonus and balance cmb's that doesnt throw the game into total fail , is to use the same type of bonuses that guns get.a 5% per level to launcher rof is equal in bonus effectivness to a 5% per level gun rof bonus.if cmb's are balanced versus gunboats then 20% by player level 5 for each boat means they remain balanced."
1/8/2010,"what can i say, stil? the quality of my opposition just gives me so much encouragement.a) is straightforward enough: you're appallingly exaggerating the potential threat of imbalance. you seem to think that if ccp decided to treat caldari the same way they treat all the other races, the entire game would come crashing down in a screaming heap of imba as the missile users would blow the very stars out of the sky. this is a load of crap and you know it.b) only covers the maybe 1 or 2 ships that might be overpowered as a result of this, like the drake. if they get overpowered because of this then either fix them again (which is not an unreasonable request, balance is always an ongoing process) or put up with it. jesus, it's not like eve has never seen an overpowered ship before *coughvagabondcough*.ok, ok, i stand corrected. you really are that stupid then.choosing not to use the bonus is like choosing to fit autocannons on an omen. they're wonderful weapons on a stabber, but that's because a stabber is bonussed for them. if you're not going to use kinetic missiles in a caracal then the launchers might as well be on a cyclone.

1/8/2010,#NAME?
1/8/2010,true. this will not fix caldari ships in general. it will not in fact turn them into pure win machines. all it will do is give bonus to damage based on the weapon fitted rather than a specific ammo type.t.
1/8/2010,"a lot of this debate seems to be focused now on the relative characteristics of the different weapons systems, when really the matter is the nature of ship bonuses.imagine the rage if the typhoon only gave its rof bonus to explosive missiles?imagine if its projectile damage bonus only applied to depleted uranium?of course, if you were to complain about this then you might be told ""learn to fly the ship, n00b! just fit whatever ammo works best for the fight and don't worry at all if you don't get any hull bonus for loading it.""i doubt minmatar pilots would be happy. they would point out that amarr and gallente ships seem to get their damage/rof bonus regardless of ammo type.similarly, if amarr ships only got their bonuses to standard crystals. i'm sure there'd be several people on this forum telling them to ""just fight within that range spec. if you need better range then just use different ammo. of course you won't get a ship bonus, but if you use the close range stuff the better ammo strength will partly counteract that, right?""t."
1/8/2010,"mate, you need to calm down."
1/8/2010,"r.o.f thing is a bad analogy, because one cannot make a gun (or missile launcher) fire faster simply be switching ammo types. also, to my understanding caldari using non-kinetic missiles is more the equivalent of matari fitting hybrids or lasers. this is because missiles come in different racial flavours. em=amarr, exp=matar, kin=caldari and therm=galente. tell me why a ship would get a bonus to a foreign weapon system and then we can start arguing all gunboats should have all possible gun fitting bonused. i like the idea of a pulsabond myself..."
1/8/2010,easiest solution: make caldari unable to shoot anything but their (bonused :p) kinetic missiles.

1/8/2010,as the principal use of this would be to split loot amongst your squad which is limited to 10 then it would seem sensible to limit the split factor to to that so you would only be able to split a stack up to 10 ways.i know fleets can be a lot more than 10 in total but the average group of friends mining or missioning will be single digits mostly i expect.
1/8/2010,"thanks for the reply, even if it's half thought out, and half assed.the point i made is simple. there might be perfectly sound sci-fi and gameplay reasons behind the actual acceleration gate mechanics,but that doesn't mean that it's not annoying, and unnecessary.as a matter of fact, like you yourself would know if you played missions, it is annoying and unnecessary that you can't bookmark, or mwd.want a corollary solution to the monetary problem? perfect. reduce rewards/ bounties. we'd be ok running more missions, as long as we don't have to wait minutes on end, and waste our time watching at empty space.it's about time for this to change, honestly. or it could stay like this, and contribute to repel potential players."
1/8/2010,"beside the ""keep completion speed down"" reasons already given to restrict the use of mdw and the capability of warping to a bookmark in a mission room there are several others you should consider (note that there are missions allowing the use of mdw and allowing you to warp directly to a bookmarked room):1) npc tracking capabilities: several npc are incapable of hitting a mdwing ships or have a short combat range (for example serpentis and gallente ships). a mdwing ship can easily become invulnerable to those factions ship fire;2) player pirates: allowing pirates to warp directly to the room where you are missioning lower the already low survival chances of a player missioning in low sec;3) mdw use and pirates: as above;4) ninja salvagers: allowing mdw use in a mission help greatly ninja salvagers and people wanting to steal crucial mission loot for ransom. 5) direct warp in to bookmarks will allow the use of capitals in missions."
1/8/2010,"again an off topic post. might be that this subject normally appeals those that play, rather than dwell the forums? (i myself put foot here only after two years...)anyhow...what you guys want -is- the game to be boring and annoying?well i can assure that you made your point clearly.in other words, who the hell cares what are the reasons behind the current situation? there are problems behind bookmark inability, and mwd veto, and this is an appeal to fix them, to make the game more enjoyable.then, let me go on over the stupidity of your reply:1) lower the rewards. problem solved. you finish the mission quicker and actually wipe the room? no problem.2) this is simply not possible, unless you have completed the mission and talked to the agent... in which case you yourself are able to warp into the bookmark, which is not the case of this proposal, nor the situation i illustrated.3)see <U+FFFD>14)this is what the game is about. inventive, reactions, ship configurations. wits.5)exactly as it happens now ""you can't warp there because natural phenomena are blocking the warp"", you can keep anything you want out of a mission acceleration gate.everything i proposed is doable and would benefit the playerbase,but seemingly people who are willing to chime in want to rant and banter, rather than accept the advantages that these modifications would bring.again, there's no way to reasonably deny that what i wrote is right, or backed up by facts, so i haven't changed my mind and i again support the topic."

1/8/2010,"wow, i'm pleased that my humble offering was that well received. i'm not sure how ccp might implement this, but it would go a long way toward making the laughably pointless bounty system worthwhile without being as easily exploited as it is currently.i would like to add a couple of responses to other replies:the payout for ship destruction would come from the insurance payout for the ship and do reduce the bounty accordingly... yes, someone mentioned that this is an isk sink and they're right, i don't see any way to prevent yet another hole but it would work just fine imo as, save with capitals, the 'sunk' isk would be relatively low overall and come from the target's insurance payout wallet... hurting the bountied target, which is the entire idea of placing bounties in the first place, to make them a nice fat target.yes, the current t2/t3 insurance joke would be a gimp in this situation, but then the pilot is likewise receiving a much reduced payout anyway if they even bother to insure the ship.how to place bounties is a quandary but i like the idea of only victims with killrights being able to post them. this will limit frivolous bounties.i'd love to be able to place such bounties on entire corporations or alliances with payout remuneration coming from a corp wallet that can cover the payout (selected at master wallet and moving downward). this would allow victims of random suicide ganks and such to place penalties, in a purely player driven manner, on corps/alliances who allow their pilots to undertake those activities without resorting to a war declaration.payouts in this instance would be taken half from the insurance payout of any pilot in that corp that is destroyed and half from the corp/alliance wallet that has sufficient isk to cover it. if the corp can't cover the difference it is deducted from the insurance payout as normal.concord rules apply, however, to attempting to take a corp/alliance bounty in secure space. just because the corp, or even individual, may have a bounty it is not a war declaration and thus attacking these targets would have consequences in secure space.the bounty would remain open an active so long as there is a remaining balance, so multiple pilots could successfully undertake it simultaneously.and, in closing, only the pilot inflicting the final blow will receive bounty payouts as with the current system. it is then up to them to distribute it, or not."
1/8/2010,"hi,after reading all proposal to make a new bounty hunter proffession, i continue to beleive taht :1. the bounty system must applied only in case of killright. relation between killright and bounty is an evidence i think.2. the system to be acceptable need to be unexploitable for pirates wanted to take advantage of this process.3. apparently lots of podders prefer a unique bounty pot (that lead to the problem of ""who can hunt who"", cause its the actual problem that lead on exploits)but i also think, if bounty is related to killright, that the right to kill dont have to be keeped by only a few podders. the problem is : how allow every person to acquire the right to chase for some bounty, and what were the ocnditions.i cant aggreed the solution of positive security status only for 2 reason : 1 it will only serve carebears, and 2 the idea that only ""good"" people can hunt is stupid for me, in a world of liberty like eve.so we need a system that autorise anybody to become a bounty hunter, but related to his faculties and security status.for exemple, if you just started for the first time, you'll just can chase for low reward bounty. when you caught some bounty, after a winning hunt, you'll can get the right to hunt bigger prices. it can easily be related to a special standing, like for mission runners.for the security status, there could be some options : if you have a sec status of... lets say 2.0 or higher. then you could just chase for bounty wanted people with less than -2 sec status (its just for example, i dont mean thoose numbers or the right...).if you're a -2 sec status, you could be allow to accept contract on people with high sec status...another idea could be to use a ""cold war"" between bounty hunters and regular pirates. for exemple, a bounty hunter need to be inscribed in an office (or something like factionnal warfare), and a pirate could be inscribed in the other side.in high sec sectors, pirates or disavantaged, cause their were obligated to flee, or just counter attack, they cant engage, unless concord will destroy them...in low sec sectors, it will be different, cause its possible to camp, or to attack in belt, planets....in 0.0 like befor, it will be the chaos... but some sector controlled by players can create special units to fight both bounty hunters or wanted personn in addition to the defense of the system.so, there are some ideas about the base of the problem, if we wanna refond the bounty hunter system to be a real funny playable thing, i think some of thoose ideas can be used...best regards, ramon wilco"

1/8/2010,"the capture the flag style sovereignty mechanics introduced in dominion have not been a big improvement over the previous pos based mechanics. several issues remain:1. time zone issues still predominate2. the timer based mechanics encourage mega-blobbing which the servers do not support and have not supported for a long time, with fights frequently determined by which combatant is able to occupy a grid first.3. a great deal of player time is spent camping a structure, shooting a structure, or repairing a structure, all of which are boring grinds for the most part.4. fights for sovereignty almost completely determined by capital ship engagements.attacking and destroying structures should not determine sovereignty. the incentive to attack structures should be to deprive an enemy of a place to shelter, resupply, or repair, just as it is in actual warfare.i propose an alternative, index based system that could leverage the existing strategic index as its basis. here is a basic outline of the mechanics that i propose:1. an attacker anchors sbus to contest sovereignty. they are invulnerable once they are online.2. after the sbus are online, each player ship kill in the contested system effects the index. kills by attackers lower the index. kills by defenders raise the index. the more valuable a ship is the more points it is worth toward raising or lowering the index.3. majority attacker presence in space causes a mild index decay, making it impossible to thwart an attack by refusing to fight. majority defender presence in space causes a mild regen, offsetting time-zone differences and making it impossible to contest a system indefinitely by anchoring tcus and then withdrawing. presence in space is defined as not docked in a station, not behind a pos shield, not cloaked, and not in warp.4. if the index reaches +10 the defenders have won. the sbus automatically offline and un-anchor and may be destroyed or scooped. if the index reaches -10 the attackers have won. the tcu automatically off-lines and un-anchors and may be destroyed or scooped. 5. defenders who have occupied a system for a long time will have an inherent advantage. the strategic index starts at whatever level it has been built to (from 1 to 5) before the system is contested.under this system, battles for systems would not take place according to a fixed timer. they will happen over days or weeks and encompass numerous small gang skirmishes and potentially major capital and sub-capital battles to take/destroy/defend structures.this system will also better support larger theaters of war where fronts comprised of a number of systems are being contested simultaneously, with forces being repositioned, and reinforced as indexes rise and fall. if the index is made part of the api we could all see the progress of ongoing wars in near real-time courtesy of the awesome folks over at dotlan.if this system were adopted, territorial wars in eve would be less about the endless camping, anchoring, shooting, and repping of structures and waiting on their timers, and more about all kinds of ship-to-ship combat. some tweaks might be necessary, but i think it would be far superior to what we have now, or any system where sovereignty is based on shooting or defending structures."
1/8/2010,"this would not stop blobs, only encourage them more than they already are encouraged. you would end up with a cluster being camped with a thousand(s) of ships, entry points having the majority of ships and a few ships ratting/mining on the inside to cause the ""decay"". even then, you would end up with a continual ping pong sov because of timezones.this idea would exacerbate the timezone issues. the purpose of these reinforcement timers is to force people from different timezones to play at the same time. without the ability to force both sides to assemble fleets for a fight at a predetermined time, sov would become extremely static.you cannot design a game to be like rl conflict simply because players usually only devote (maybe) a few hours in a day to a fight, as compared to non-stop fighting with no ability to escape in rl wars."
1/8/2010,"a giant blob is just going to sit camping a choke point 23/7 forever? under this system the giant blob really isn't going to do you any good. as soon as it disburses (and it would have to eventually) the enemy will be right back in. ultimately, the only way to win would be to be better at pvp on a sustained basis than your opponent.sov wouldn't really ping-pong. the index would tend to rise during one side's prime-time, and fall in the other, until one side got the eventual upper-hand by winning more skirmishes (probably, mostly on weekends and during border times when both sizes were on), and depriving the other side of infrastructure to resupply and repair. that's just what i want from a game; to be forced to play at 2 in the morning for 4 hours on a weeknight. only if those contesting sov were very evenly matched, both in terms of combat skill and ability to replace losses. there would still be plenty of reasons to assemble capital fleets at the same time to kill/save stations, poses, hubs, etc. those would still matter, they just wouldn't be mechanically tied to sov.even in actual wars individual soldiers or even companies of soldiers don't fight non-stop for days or weeks on end, though an entire army might. there are skirmishes, lulls in the fighting, offensives, etc. there's no reason that a game can't be like that."
1/8/2010,i would like to see the ability to repper ships and mods in a pos environment especially drones however i think it would perhaps make it a bit too easy... perhaps if ships that are parked in a ship maint array say... overnight would slowly regenerate armor and structure automatically... but it would have to be parked in there for a minimum of 6 hours or so in order to receive effect... or an option made avail to repair ship in maint bay which it would tell you locks this ship out for x amount of time until repairs are finished and the ship is stuck in the maint bay until repairs are completed... the amount of time depending on the ammount of damage needing to be repaired... not really paying attn to this thread just felt like tossing in 2 cents and seeing if i hear back about it thru other channels.
1/8/2010,"i had this idea, but in a variant. if ship assembly arrays build the ships, shouldn't they also be able to repair them? what if they required a number of minerals and an amount of time based on the damage to the ship? therefore a 40% damaged ship would require 40% of each mineral required to make the ship and 40% of the time it takes to manufacture the ship.i had a variant of that listed in my pos mechanics proposal listed here:pos mechanics redesign."
1/8/2010,"the remote ecm burst on motherships is a fairly effective weapon, but it's been in need of a change for sometime. i think it's obvious where we should go with it. a remote projected racial ewar module. the first thought most people have with this is gallente should get a remote dictor bubble, amarr a cap neutralizing bubble, and minmatar should get a webification bubble. i think those three would be very useful. although the cap/tackling ewars would probably be more strategically useful, they would also be overpowered imo. it would be too easy for moms with their ewar immunity (which i dont want changed) and a long range warp in to do the job of tacklers/recons. i think we should stick to the tech 1 ewar racial bonuses...replace projected electronic counter measures skill with ""projected electronic warfare"" - 5% reduction in module activation -- using a base 5min cooldown (3min 45sec w/ lvl 5) - 10% bonus to effect radius -- using a base 20km radius (30km w/ lvl 5) - 20% bonus to effect duration -- using a 20sec base effect duration (40secs w/ lvl 5) - possibly add an isotope fuel costfuel cost: i'm not sure on this, but even though i don't want to lug extra combat topes around, it does seem appropriate.as for what these racial ewar bursts do... i think it would be easier to balance and work with if we use the ""tech 1"" racial ewar, also remember caldari are the only race without a ""tech 2"" ewar, ecm gets dual bonuses on their t2 ewar ships. ewar strengths are debateable, but they should be significant. the current remote ecm burst uses 25 ecm strength and is unaffected by ew skills. using that as an example in adjusting the percentage based ews would really bust up somethings we'd have a 190% sensor damp, which would just make it an ecm basically. so instead i went with the intention behind the remote ecm burst as being designed to be very effective. these effects last the duration on any ships not ewar immune in the radius of the target. this isn't a bubble going up, it's a ewar burst around a target effecting all ships nearby.racial effects: (numbers are a starting point and very debateable) wyvern - remote ecm burst w/ 25 ecm strength nyx - sensor damp burst w/ 40% aeon - tracking disruption burst w/ 40% hel - target painting burst w/ 40%last notes wyvern: where ecm is meant to be. the addition of effect duration like regular ecm makes this much more valuable than currently. nyx: could really hurt long range fleets as well as shortly after a wyvern uses it's burst. aeon: with the right balancing the effect of this could be devastating to any turret based fleet. hel: this is a little tricky, since this effect is the only really aggressive one, this would need balancing to keep hel's from using the burst to solo-pwn with fighterbombers. but needs to be strong enough to be a worthwile addition to it's fleet.thanks for havin a look and please remember to check support if you like the idea. remember values are just starting points obviously i leave the balancing to ccp. the idea is what i'm proposing."

1/9/2010,"quotin this for next decembers ""best of 2010.."" comeback category, cos its just that bad."
1/9/2010,"hmm after readin a lot of posts down to the last one, i want to add a bit of my own thoughts.do not take this as an offense as i would just like to add some more flavour to this discussion:make 2 classes of missile boats of caldari design:1st group has 10% kin dmg bonus and 5% to all other dmg types (like kestrel)2nd group gets rof (raven for e.g.)i fly caldari and gallente myself and there is really a point in changing caldari ships. if they are supposed to be ""the"" missile using race they shud get more benfits than only kin dmg per ship level trained.to everybody who complains bout that, do not forget that if u want to pvp effectively u need to sacrifice at least 1 (better 2) med slots for a warpjammer and preferably add a web coz missiles as well suffer from less dmg to a movin target. actually missiles are the only weapon system u can run away from (intys). ye i know what u guys are gonna say trackin and stuff. still missiles are outclassed coz they cant do insta-dmg which means ur missiles may fly and hit nothing coz the targets already dead,...i just wanted to add that missiles do suffer from speed as well. add the fact that missile dmg is weak anyways compared to other weapons that makes em even less effective as they cud be. and think of most fights take place at close range due to the somewhat limited range of tackle (t2 warpjam is 24k not overheated). there u go for missiles range bonus. after all someone already mentioned that u can still warp out if a caldari missile boat breaks ur tank from range.and not to forget by sacrificing med slots u kill a caldari ships tank due to the fact that shield tankin isnt as effective as armor tankin. just take a look at the base specs:em/exp/kin/therm:caldari shields0/50/40/20 (110)armor gal:50/10/35/35 (130)amarr:50/20/25/35 (130)mimi:60/10/25/35 (130)adding all res to one number shows what i mean. u got a 20 point higher res in average as u would ever get on shields. and the widely used damage control ii also grants more res to armor as it does over shields. taht makes armor more effective compared to shield tanks.so if caldari got a buff they would still suffer from weaker tanks and do just a bit more dmg. what are people so afraid of? caldari has been a step child when it comes to pvp for the last years and have been nerfed over and over. this attempt wouldn't make em overpowered. maybe bring em a bit closer to the other races to be able to compete a bit better when it comes to pvp, which is the core of the whole game after all.to those people who complain bout the buff i adress one question: why dont u fly caldari? guess i know the answer already...regards people!supported!"
1/9/2010,"er.. if the target's already dead, then there's no problem is there. your issue here is with killmail whoring."
1/9/2010,"on the other hand rollthor; the gallente and amarr have to sacrifice tank to do damage due to both mod types being on the lows. the also suffer a loss of utility in the mids for the tackle. that could be considered double the hit that the caldari suffer.citing minmatar for armour is specious at best, because minmatar tank depends on the ship your flying; even within the same ship class. eg; ruppy armour, stabber speed, bellicose shield (not that anyone uses the 'cose in pvp) and scythe....lol.arguing on natural resists is typically pointless because any ship the pilot is fussed about losing will be rainbow-tanked.the fact of the matter is that the caldari, as a whole, do not need a blanket boost because as a whole they are balanced against the other races in terms of overall damage potential (which means that in ideal circumstances, which do occasionally happen, damage is at a parity between races on equivalent fits). this proposed ""fix"" would not do anything but un-balance the races. what is needed, as ive already admitted elsewhere, is that certain underpowered ships require boosting in unrelated area's, because they suffer from problems unrelated to their bonuses."
1/9/2010,"exactly, we're gonna say tracking and stuff cause i'm about 99% sure its a hell of alot easier to outrack a gun to the point of no damage than it is to out race a missile to no damage. and to get those speeds you need mwd which on any ship other than inty, blows up your sig, actually causing more damage. and as somebody said, km *****.....no disadvantage here.first, missile damage is not weak to other weapons. and you can still warp out if a missile boat breaks your tank from range but you can't warp out if a turret boat breaks your tank from range? was this in the patch notes?no disadvantage here.fail, shield tanking and armor tanking are pretty much balanced, each having their own uses in pvp. shield buffer is good, active shield is good. armor buffer is good, and more convenient. i won't go into this but this is not related to the topic on hand.as for sacrificing mid slots, your ships have more midslots for a reason, and armor tankers must sacrifice tank for damage. no disadvantage here.lows slot module = hull and armor, so obviously it's going to benefit the hull/armor tankers more.no disadvantage here.admitted, missile pvp strategy is different than turret pvp, but that in no way makes it inferior or less effective. if used correctly, missiles are very very good pvp weapons. they can be more effective than turrets depending on the situation.i don't fly caldari because i started gallente, and cross trained to minmatar when i found gallente are sucking right now. i value the speed of minmatar, but am very jealous of the fact that missiles are pretty versatile in pvp.sooooo whoops, i guess you didn't already know the answer"
1/9/2010,"dcu is low slot module, so that means it takes up a slot in an armor tank and it's a bonus slot for any shield tank, you want to complain about that ?!"

1/9/2010,i support this with song li as well. this would create new industrial opportunities of global scale across all factions for a vast amount of items to be completely built and sold by capsulers.

1/9/2010,"while i would like to see these things being player made and sold on the market, something to consider is the effect your going to have on the market. those items are an isk sink right now, and without them acting like an isk sink we will have to come up with a different way to remove isk from the eve economy. i think we can all agree that isk sinks are important, and pos's of all things are one of the most used isk sinks you can find anywhere. sure sov with dominion costs isk now too and that sinks a large chunk of isk, but i get the impression ccp was looking for more sinks not less. if, and only if another reasonable isk sink was brought up could i support this."
1/9/2010,this proposal would have to be balanced out by adding some form of isk sink to replace those lost by adding new bpos.not supported.
1/9/2010,"i think i see where song li is going with this but i would expand the idea to avoid the isk sink counterargument. what about turning not just towers into bpc's or a rare bpo drop but lots of items like skill books. in effect you are then making them an isk sink because players have to venture into space and explore (which is what space is all about) to get them which is an isk sink in itself. you lose ships in 0.0. tweaking of sites/plexes or adding them as a reward to a huge mission arc are ways of getting people to spend isk/time to get the reward. just today i was in a 0.0 system trying to run a plex and got jumped on the way out. a friend lost a 100+ million isk ship = isk sink. we didn't even get to finish the site. it despawns and the cycle starts again. anyways - the idea needs to be expanded though. i would even like to see this replace invention and see things like t2 bpcs run this way. complex goals and datacores from research alts all required to run a mission that takes you into 0.0 etc etc to get this bpc. make the isk that needs to be spent come from the things we need to be expendable. ships, trit/mins, modules, etc. podding is an issue but the new standings fix should have fixed that to not ultimately deter 0.0 completely. not to mention making missions diverse enough to where larger knowledgable corps cant' camp them or monopolize them. just my .2 isk."
1/9/2010,"no, that is not an isk sink. isk sinks remove isk from the game, not a persons wallet, when your friend bought that ship, he gave those 100m isk to someone else, and that someone still has it. in addition to that, your friend got insurance from his ship, adding even more isk to the game.i thought it was a great idea, right up until i read the isk sink arguement. if a way can be found to make everything player made while replacing the isk sink functionality of them, i will support it again, but until that point, it would hurt the economy too much to be worth it."
1/9/2010,"towers and their modules are usually bought with general proximity to where they will be set up; as a retired empire pos cleanup expert, i know that the majority of my post-op sales of faction pos modules are made to buyers i can find in my journal - those that bought a tower or other pos modules from me.being able to track who is buying what kind of pos + loadout and where could result in an unnecessarily risky trader's environment for newer corps hoping to go set up their first tower.if the tower purchase is transparent, the chances of someone noticing them and finding out where they set up the tower are greatly diminished. if the tower purchase is not transparent, someone could intentionally have a character that sells nothing but towers in order to review the buyer in their journal, then have a scout follow the buyer to find out where they set up.besides these elements, this would remove an isk sink from the game, as mentioned by others. there are few enough of these as it is."
1/9/2010,"not supported, because of isk inflation"
1/9/2010,"strong support for this. if you think about how isk sinks and faucets are laid out now vs. the direction the csm has been pushing them for a few terms this makes a lot of sense.they need to exist, both of them, but they need to be in the right places. opening up these things to player production increases market areas for people to compete it, increases the value of a strong industrial backbone for alliances, and is much more in keeping with the spirit of the game.i mean heck, npcs could sell everything in the game (ships, mods, etc) but it'd not be nearly as cool of a game. eve has a largely player run economy and that's a major selling point for the game. i see this proposal, either all at once or more likly something ccp phases in gradually, as aimed toward a more perfect realization of that goal"
1/9/2010,a good idea is a good idea regardless of who has it. fully endorse this. as for isk 'inflation'? not seeing how this would be so.
1/9/2010,support this we already build the rest of stuff why not the rest to
1/9/2010,"specifically with respect to pos and pos modules. these are one of the largest isk sinks, so, as others have said, the isk flow would have to be very carefully rebalanced to compensate it.however, one very good effect of making these into player-made items would be that they would be a huge mineral sink, which we badly need.edit: however, pos should only be producable in lo-sec/0.0, in the same way capital ships are. in fact it would be cool if they needed an upgraded outpost to create, since it would actually make 0.0 industry economically and strategically relevant."
1/9/2010,"speaking as an industrialist, i'm quite pleased with the idea of even more markets to try and sell items in. however,(you just saw that coming, right?)they need to be phased in in such a way that the hard costs to corporations and alliances for holding and maintaining space, stations, and other things aren't erased, and replaced with soft costs. by hard costs i mean money that actually leaves the organization (or in this case, the eve economy), as opposed to money that circulates around inside it.the primary reason for this concern is that, in eve, it is very possible for a large enough alliance or corporation to produce every item they could possibly need,typically for less than the market price (ergo, profit). but doing this for some of those items, particularly the consumables will actually reduce the hard costs of holding sov and maintaining towers by whatever percent the acceptable markup is.for example, my employer has something like 1800 servers in our data centers. but we don't make our servers, we buy them, because it's cheaper for us to buy them from someone who makes them and resells them. but exactly the opposite situation exists in eve. it's equally practical for a large corporation to make a given item as it is for them to buy it, and making it is normally cheaper. given an assumption of equal practicality (that is, the materials needed are on hand and the facilities exist to do so) cost is going to be the determining factor in how large corporations do procurement.if the cost to make these items is 20 - 30% (just to have some numbers to work with) it will lower the cost of the related activities (pos fueling, etc) by that much, reducing the effectiveness of those isk sinks on maintaining a relative balance in the economy.all of that said, i am not opposed to the csm bringing this up with ccp. but i think careful consideration needs to be applied to the long term effects that the change over of some of these items might produce."
1/9/2010,"partial support.i wouldn't like to see the npc items as bpos, but as bpcs. bpos imo would destabilize the markets too much and wouldn't work as well as an isk sink."

1/9/2010,"provided that a proper isk-sink is put in place to make up for it, yes."
1/9/2010,"while i'm all for improved marketing and manufacturing, i don't think this idea is the best unless massive changes to the market are made. the economy as it is right now is very smooth, with a large amount of isk gathered, traded, and lost (faucets, market, and sinks).if we tried to reduce the number of isk sinks (by this proposal), we would either have to replace them with other isk sinks (no insurance, other items which only npcs sell, etc), or reduce the number of faucets (limit mining, no missions, etc). both of these i cannot see happening.i would eventually like to see meta 0 loot stop being dropped by npcs, and perhaps replace them with tags or something similar, but this cannot happen until the number of manufacturing lines are doubled and mining is made more interesting so more people will want to do it. until these two effects take place, removing meta 0 loot from npcs would be a disaster to the economy and the game's delicate balance.i'm not saying that the answer is not out there for this problem, but it would require a near-complete economic rewrite. if it ain't broke, don't fix it.tl;dr: too complicated to implement with too many hurdles to overcome. not supported."

1/9/2010,"removing local massively increases the risk to the very people that ccp is trying to entice out of highsec. as various dev blogs and posts made perfectly clear during the build up to dominion, 0.0 is supposed to be a viable place for people to live full-time, to rat and mine and construct, not just a battlegrounds arena where people visit to pvp before heading back to their empire homes. if anything, ccp's future plans for 0.0 are to make it even safer and more profitable for the residents, not to pull the rug out from beneath their feet and send them fleeing back to motsu.removing local would be hilarious fun for the roaming hac gangs, for about a week. after being ganked a few times by undetected hostiles, the average 0.0 ratter will say 'screw this' and head back to the safety of highsec to run missions like a sensible person. hope you guys enjoy a deserted 0.0 and roaming for 4 hours without finding a single target!"

1/9/2010,"wormholes are fun, but they're a niche arena for relatively small numbers of players. the entrances and exits are dynamic and unpredictable, the amount of people who can use one before it collapses is limited, and they don't show up on the map. its not as though your roaming hac gang can log in and the fc says 'ok guys lets go back to that same w-space system we visited last week' because the entrance has probably moved on and so there's no predictable route. as things stand w-space pve'rs have a fine balance with 0.0 pve'rs, if you find a group of wormholers before they find you, then you can sneak up on them without local spooking them and hurt them badly, but the wormholers are much harder to find in the first place since usually nobody knows where they are or how to get to them.on the other hand, 0.0 and lowsec is already known. anyone can look at a map to see where the abc ores and the l4q20 agents are and who has put up infrastructure, or can can just look at the red 'npcs killed in the last 24 hours' dots on the map and know exactly where there are ravens to gank, and exactly how to get there.with the exception of ccp engineering alliance, there's not a single alliance in this game that can prevent hostiles roaming through their space, and by removing local you'll vastly reduce the opportunity for space holding alliances to even detect and respond to such incursions.so i guess your argument is that everybody should leave 0.0 and go back to highsec? hey, remove local and maybe you'll get that wish, but ccp produced the dominion expansion specifically because they wanted to see thriving 0.0 populations and industries, rather than empty wastelands populated by moon-mining towers and the occasional refueler.you could increase potential personal income in 0.0 by 50%, or 100%, or 250%, it doesn't matter. if all that happens is that the ratter loses his ship to a pack of undetected hostiles when he tries to go out and make that income, he's not going to stick around to get ganked over and over, he's going to say 'screw this' and move to motsu to make a safe (even if it is nerfed) l4 income."

1/9/2010,"i don't think the issue would be with actual m3 cargo, but rather with the type. if you're sending a mining drone to an asteroid, nothing needs to be stored in cargo. all you need to do is start a timer as soon as the drone reach the asteroid, and when that timer runs out, the drone returns and x amount of the appropriate ore type is created. if you send a salvage drone to a wreck, it needs to actually test if it's successfull instead of just having a timer, and if it is, it need to remove the wreck and memorize what specific salvage items and in what amount were retrieved without actually adding it to a real cargo bay until it reach your ship again. the ""cargo bay"" on mining drones is probably not a real cargo bay, but rather just a value used to inform you about how long it will take for your drone to complete its timer so that it can return to your ship and create the item when it gets there.however, if ccp can find a way to solve it, support."
1/9/2010,"for a drone to carry stuff, it needs to become a database entry that can have dependent entries;that is to say, something similar to thisplayer (independent parent entity) - rupture (container) - cargohold (container sublevel) - tritanium 1x - civilian damage control 1x - standard secure container (container sub-sublevel) - emp m 3,440x - bloodclaw light missile 1,785 - salvager drone (container, dependent child entity, hooked to ai controller interface) - cargohold (container sublevel) - armor plates 13x - alloyed tritanium bar 8x - corpse female (hey, drones get lonely too!)now, when the drone gets scooped, it would have to perform an asset trade with the player's ship in space first, to get rid of ""its"" assets; what's in its cargohold doesn't belong to you on a database level until it's in your cargo. it can't be scooped until the asset trade has been completed, because that would place a dependent, artificially controlled entity within a user controlled entity, with its own dependency tree. why this is bad is because, like with putting a hyperactive child in a car, the child is going to be asking 'are we there yet' before you've even turned on the engine; a drone will be constantly checking to see if it has something to do with its cargo or if there's any of its ai routines to perform, even while in your drone bay.so, upon scooping, it would not only need to be emptied (before being scooped to your cargo, causing an extra database transfer of dependency/container trees), but its ai would need to be unhooked to prevent it from going berserk in your drone-bay. when launched, an entire subset of ai controllers would need to be reenabled for the drone in addition to the current, comparatively basic set of controllers in place already just for it to float around and ignore your commands.when you launch drones, there's a brief spike before they appear; this is them being changed from a standard database entry to an ai controlled, dependent child object.when you scoop drones, there is a brief spike as their ai gets killed and they are turned back into a container object.when you launch fighters, their standard drone ai is loaded in addition to their subset of ai that controls whether they follow something in warp or not.these kinds of issues are the same reason you can't have players 'docking' with carriers, motherships or titans right now; because you'd essentially be placing a player inside another player.now, i'm no database engineer nor programmer, so i'm trying to explain this in laymens terms based on what i understand of databases; that said i could be entirely wrong, but as far as i'm aware there are good (and similar) reasons why this sort of thing isn't being done already.with reference to mining drones; i'm thinking that how they work is, after their cycle time, they essentially remove a portion of the id:quantity from an asteroid and are assigned a temporary id:quantity tag, which, when they get to your ship, causes them to spawn an invisible/imaginary container that your ship automatically retrieves the ore from; if your cargo is full, the container is spawned, allowing the drone to dump the ore, and then despawns immediately. this couldn't work for salvage as, for salvage to exist, it needs to be removed from a very real database-side container (the wreck), placed into a very real container for the drone, then placed into one of these invisible containers to be moved to your ship."
1/9/2010,have salvage drones simply recycle the wrecks into cargo containers whislt in space? that way you eliminate the problem of having a transfer on dock - all the drones would do would be to harvest a wreckage field so the player would come along and scoop the leftover containers up with a tractor beam?
1/9/2010,"if not a salvager drone, at least a tractor drone would be nice.for tractor drone i mean a drone that reach a distant wreck (or jetcan), lock it with a tractor beam and the return to your ship with it in tow. not as useful as an actual salvage drone, it will still be a nice addition to the utility drones."
1/9/2010,"and completely remove all the work ninjas have to do to get at salvage, as the wrecks now come pre-salvaged for them and they need to nothing but loot them?hell yeah i completely support that idea!this wouldn't at all please those that are wanting to use drones to clean up salvage for them where they are ignoring loot by default, though, which i think accounts for the majority of the people wanting something like this rather than the minority.they want their salvage brought to them on a silver platter, not to have to work for it."
1/9/2010,"well sorry like i said.... i am new to this forum so i will try not to write multiple suggestions next time. and... ok i can agree that self destructing a ship is possible etc etc. but you should still get something(killmail)@ the comment of ""stop playing kb online"" i dont know any pvper that i have talked to that doesnt like killmails....its how we get our satisfaction and feeling of fulfilment... carebears get shiney new items from lp agents etc... miners get iskies... we just want kms to make us feel awesome :) i dont think that it is to much to ask."
1/9/2010,"my issue is that we kill caps for profit. self destruct on a ship that takes 7-8 bs's 5+ min to kill means we're denied any loot at all (bar salvage, which isn't that great anyway). despite what some obvious 'self destructing' pros are saying in this thread, the majority of players who have an opinion on this agree that it's a mechanic that needs to be revisited.anyone who suggests 'bring more dps' is just spewing the common response to this complaint, and they're wrong, because usually it takes more than 2 min to get support from a couple of jumps away on an impromptu request."
1/9/2010,"you know, if we just deleted killmails from the game entirely we'd solve all of these problems."
1/9/2010,"i can understand that, and i agree that general mining needs to have static locations to aid the new players, especially in starter systems. however, ice is a field that takes about two months to get into, and that's only if you dedicate yourself to achieving this goal above all others.in addition, having the belts scanned out into deadspace complexes would accomplish many goals, such as making suicide ganking the ships with disposable alts far more difficult, and making the whole task of ice mining more dynamic. i've weighed all the options very carefully, and i think this is the best solution to the problem.does anybody know why i have to reply to one of the posts i created just to support it? steupid forum software...."

1/9/2010,"quick summary and a bit of criticism:present: 10absent: 4personally i hate having to count such things, include it next time.makes for some headscrathing interpretation of the voting results. some there were 7 votes, some there were 9, some there were 10. yet you can clearly count that 10 were present.list abstain count? in any case i do not see significant reason why delegates should be permitted to vote blank or abstain if present.think of this from the electorates point of view, they can reasonably expect you to have a qualified opinion about the things you vote on. if not, the question becomes ""what are you doing there when you are clearly misrepresenting or incapable of representing us?"".another thing, how does a ""7 for"" becomes a pass? just a matter of principle. of 14, 7 is not more than half.the actual issue should pass. anyone who has read it ought to vote in favour of it - if you can manage to stop wondering why this was not changed ages ago, but it is one of a mountain of testaments that noone wants to (or knows how to) work with the ui and the underlying code.but that is not the point. the point is that there was not a majority of delegates backing it.another point.considering how insignificant it appears next to ""real"" issues, is colour of mining beams really something that needs to be taken up at csm level, instead of in features and ideas?it seems like the kind of thing you would put under ""misc. and trivial items:"" at the end if you had nothing else of importance and had time to burn.in any case both are so miniscule that i wonder why you bother collecting them for later submission to ccp.even a amateur/hobby programmer could insert such a dialogue in minutes. similarly for the mining beam colour.it would be less effort for them to just do it than hold a meeting and discuss whether they think it should pass or not.in short think of the messages this is sending.ccp-something (reading list) "".. and they want colored miningbeams and a confirmation box on alliance creation.""ccp-something2 ""laz0r color and a yes/no box? we don't need a csm for chicken**** like that. drop those muppets a hint and send them some ideas for real stuff that we want done anyway, so we don't look like complete idiots next time."".if it was me who was a ccp dev, i'd be insulted that the hyped height of player-to-dev interaction, the csm, was littered with stuff like that. i'd be like, ""are you guys taking this and us seriously or do you think it's just some kind of badge of importance?"".another thing, do you guys even have some minimum standard? from the hybrid guns point.i kid you not, that is what it says - that is *all* it says about solutions.i have to break it to you, that is not a solution, that is vague wishing. have you no shame?you should not even have voted on it, it should have been outright rejected before it got that far, for being extremly vague and not providing, if fact not even hinting at any solutions and worst of all not in any clear way specify what the problem is.i am not a big fan of (large) hybrids myself, but come on, you are on the csm and all we get is some hippie dope along the lines of ""hey man, i want you to buff hybrids"".the linked thread (there is only one) is a pre-dominion one and is just someone moaning about blaster range on his deimos and you clearly get the impression that he has zealot e-peen length envy, as there is nothing of substance in his post.not good enough. not by a long shot."
1/9/2010,"i will consider it because you asked so nicely . seriously you are moaning about the hassle of counting the delegates yet are complaining about the triviality of the topics in the meeting, double standards? i suggest you read the csm dev blogs ( short summary ) which will answer many of these questions. short answer, 7 voters are required for a vote to count and it will pass only with a majority.there are 9 full members and unsurprisingly that is also the maximum number of people who are allowed to vote on any one issue. alternates will step in and vote if less than 9 full delegates are present.abstaining is not allowedregarding ""trivial"" issues, they have to be raised as per anything else however ccp will put them on a separate list for the iceland summit (i.e. they won't take time away from important issues when we talk to ccp).because we represent the players and the players bring this stuff up. ignoring stuff because you think it is trivial just means it clogs up the forums for months.no, it is saying that players have raised these issues and the csm have classed them as trivial. again, trivial items go on a separate list to ccp.thank you captain obvious. if you read the minutes i seemingly wasted 5 hours preparing you will see that i and others said exactly that to the proposal...there are 9 full delegates and they get to pick which issues they wish to cover. i am no more responsible for what korvin decides to bring up as he is for what i want to bring up.i'm sorry you feel that way and hope to see you running for csm next time to show us all how to do better"

1/10/2010,"confirming the confirmation. i've never seen naomi make a post that is constructive or supported by evidence. her game is whinging, nothing more."
1/10/2010,"even if it is much harder to outrun missiles than turrets,it is much more easier to lower missile dmg than turret,you just only need to move your ships as most missiles wont hit for max dmg without webbing/targetpainting the target,oh and you dont need to travel transversally like against turrets, which is much harder to do in actual battle. as fleet size increase you will find it that you wont be able to keep transversal up against all enemy ,not like missiles where all enemy will still suffer from your speed.target speed/signature decreases missile dps much more than it does with turret dps. it doesnt matter if turrets miss sometimes and missiles dont while turrets still do more dmg with those hits than missiles.turret dps applied as soon as you fire ,while missile dps will have delay usually 10-15 sec at long range. so if you have enough dps to kill the target in 8 secs and target can warp out in 9secs then turrets will kill the target and missiles wont. that shows how bad delay dmg is.also if you keep firing at the target until it is dead/warps out you will loose your missiles still in flight to the target,this doesnt happen with turrets.no they aren't balanced,yeah this isnt related to this topic. damage control just favours armor more than shield for no reason,i've already pointed out that it is unbalanced in another topic.what is missile strategy then?all should fly the same caldari ships in your gang to be able to use that strategy?,that is hardly doable except for caldari role players. yes missiles are much less effective thats why most snipe gangs use turrets.i realy dont get where missiles are more effective than turrets,at close range turret ships>missile ships, and at range where long range missiles dps gets more than turret dps the delay just kills that advantage easily.so how should missiles be used corretly,because using turrets corretly is easy?do they nowadays? because as i checked out burn edens kb it shows me they use amarr ships most of the time,same with triums at least they had some ravens in one of their battles,wonder why they did that as other battles completly lack missle ships.so isnt this hightly effective missiles are the past and only lives in your memory?"
1/10/2010,"wrong. apart from rockets, anyway. and they're getting their boost.stop blobbing."
1/10/2010,"you're forgetting that even a little movement causes not so perfect hits with turrets, lowering the dps. think about blasters, where even in optimal range, the target must be webbed and scrambled in order to maybe do a large portion of the dps. kinda like missiles, they must be webbed and painted in order to do large portions of dps.missiles have no real disadvantage in this area...turrets almost never do perfect dps either, and must use webs and painters to do full damage.guns have signature radius too, you know. if you're shooting at an undersized target with missiles, you're going to do less damage, just like turrets.i saw somebody complain about how their torps were doing 10 dps to a t3 cruiser in another thread wrong sized weapon system.if you're really worried about losing those 4-8 missiles that get lost in flight time, you're probably just not carrying enough ammo. this has nothing to do with the kinetic bonus....also, the issue of how slow missiles are has nothing to do with the kinetic bonus. make a new thread to increase speed and decrease flight time, don't try to use that as an argument of why caldari boats should get rainbow bonuses.shield and armor tanking are pretty much balanced. shield gets recharge, armor get slightly more buffer. shield cap intensive, but can tank more dps for a short time. armor can be sustained, but can't tank as much.i'm not going into it anymore, but they are balanced. and damage control is a low slot module. that's for armor and hull. it does what it's supposed to do, and shield gets a little bonus. it favors it more cause its an armor and hull module, it goes in low slot. i don't know what else to say to get you to stop ignoring that fact...using turrets is not easy. in fact, i'd say it's a little harder than using missiles.as for using the same missile boat to get same strategy, same goes for turret ships, missile boats aer no different. you wouldn't use a muninn with a vagabond and expect them to use same strategy, one is short range and the other is long range. obviously you need to use turret ships that go well together, and use missile ships that go well with each other. there is no difference or disadvantage to anything there..."
1/10/2010,are you serious or just trolling?you have just made an argument for limiting drone ship bonuses to only their racial drone type.
1/10/2010,"confirmation confirmed, well that's that then"
1/10/2010,"agreed about removing rof penalty and decreasing sig (and maybe mass) a bit; maybe extra 5% to fitting.as for slots and bonuses, leave them alone and learn to figure out the ships' purposes. destroyers are, for the most part, pack animals and not solopwnmobiles. cata's bonus to optimal works just as fine as falloff bonus for blasters - because optimal is half their range - and gives it flexibility to fit rails (but of course not compete with cormorant in that). corm's tracking bonus makes sure it will hit the target not only at max range, but also as it's spiraling towards you (and with -75% tracking penalty on spike, you need that extra tracking). replacing tracking bonus with damage bonus won't help at all - you still won't alpha anything solo, and if you're a sniper you won't point anything either. also, without tracking bonus, you're taking away its flexibility to be anything except the long-range sniper. if you need more grid - use rigs, they're cheap now. if you need even more grid - train advanced weapon upgrades (you should have it anyway tbh).interdictors could possibly use some looking into - though on the other hand, they will likely be fine once rockets are fixed. they could share the sig radius decrease with destroyers though, if that comes through.overall, not supported in proposed form."

1/10/2010,"proposed lowsec expansion 'outlaw'i renamed the thread title..lowsec needs some serious attention to make it the great place it should be... and im not talking about fw, which is pretty much unrelated to 'real' lowsec.lowsec is about criminals, its about piracy, its about the dark underworld of new eden. i think its about time it had some deserved attention. it would take a lowdec patch to really turn it into the place it should be, i suggest ccp do just that, the update should be called 'outlaw'.i have the following proposals for this, and by no means are these all my ideas, so thanks to all the people who have put ideas around before...1: criminal underworld, similar to 0.0 sov, recognition should be given to the 'overlords' who dominate systems, some sort of benefits may be 'bought' with underhand payments to authorities, such as the rats in a system may notengage unless fired upon, or reduced facility rates, offices etc. maybe something similar to the new sov mechanics with a 'hub' pos using modules to upgrade the system. this would need to be les impacting than 0.0, so the best you could upgrade should not be as good as an un-upgraded 0.0 system.2: criminal faction agents for missions. beter rewards for missions in lowsec generally. thesse agents would be ayt pirate stations that can only be found by probing.3: the blackmarket, have a market that can only be accessed when in lowsec, and with items that can only be sold on the black market. all 'illegal' items moved onto this market. maybe with npc smuggling items too. create more illegal items to load onto the market. more drugs, maybe illegal implants... see also 4. the black market panel only becomes available when in a black market station, which would only be the pirate/criminal stations.4: pirate faction ships and items become illegal in hisec, so whilest usable in hisec, become available only through the black market....5: make better smuggling oportunities, with these illegal items, make a smuggling proffesion more viable.6: crooked cops, have random faction npcs for that region wander lowsec, looking for payoffs.. hand over a little isk to go free, or fight them..maybe the overlord can see to it that these crooked cops dont interfere with their people...7: have lowsec borders between all the empires, or at least the empires who are at war, so there is no 'safe' route for people, this way people would actually hire escort personel to protect haulers, another career opportunity. smugglers would also be employed in such places...8: new pos modules such as pleasure hubs and so on, could be you need to supply it with drugs/food/alcahol etc and in return it earns money. would need to be limited to like 1 or 2 per pos though to avoid large pos 'super brothels' being built en-mass in systems to make huge isk. this income should be small in comparison to moon mining etc.9: some form of cyno jamming as in 0.0, lowsec is becoming blobbed with caps... possibly only the system that an alliance has 'godfather' status could be cyno jammed... would be part of the upgrades available to system overlords.10: better ore, better missions etc, to keep the isk warriors coming in despite the risk.alot of people are saying how there arnt enough people coming to lowsec, but people need to have a reason to go there. im not interested in getting more carebears to wander in to get ganked (yes im a pirate, but i prefer a fight), what id like to see is more organisations fighting for turf. gang wars, pirate factions fighting each other, or real opportunities for anti pirates to go in and wage war against their hated enemies.we need a deeper immersion for lowsec, bring it on please, make lowsec the dark and dangerous underbelly that society loves to hate... lowsec shouldnt be a dangerous version of hisec, just as 0.0 isnt a no concord version of hisec. it should be a seperate experience in itself"

1/10/2010,low sec problem is that pirating is easy. it is extremely easy to find targets (if they are there) and kill them if they aren't there searching for a fight. so most people that is not interested in pirating spend as little time as possible in low sec.so making pirating even easier will not help you. it will simply push even more people away from low sec.
1/10/2010,"the problem is that pirating is easy, so if you go into lowsec without proper protection or fleet, you will die. however, nobody even goes to lowsec unless they're stupid or looking for a fight because everything in high sec and 0.0 is safer and more profitable.bump for a lowsec boost"
1/10/2010,"because ""real"" lowsec consists of smartbombing a gate for hours on end. no lowsec is mostly about some failure smartbombing a gate for hours on end.who knew- i actually like this idea. maybe if you rent an office in a lowsec system you have an option to pay a monthly bribe to avoid gate guns.this already exists sort of- sure sprinkle a few more agents around lowsec.lame and impractical. most illegal items either have no use whatsoever or are hardly used (ie boosters)not only lame but incredible stupid- unless your goal is to crash the pirate ship market completely. items that are only made by npc's and only bought by npcs are lame. as for smuggling- its already in game. just try to fly a fat load out of jita- but cross your fingers.perhaps we could call them rats- and put them in belts. hmm belt rats.this idea has been proposed over and over and over...basically what it amounts to is the guys gate hes smartbombing isnt getting enough traffic and could ccp do something to make ppl stand in line to be killed.low sec isnt ""terf""- its a wasteland. if i wanted terf id go to nullsec. if i wanted relative safty id go to hi sec. if im bored and want to see ppl smartbombing gates i go to lowsec. why exactly are we comparing everything to hi sec?"
1/10/2010,"i could see this, as it would give an isk sink to compensate for the increased rewards with item number 2. however, the main reason there aren't as many targets in low-sec is due to the reputation, so only systems of 0.3 or below should have this advantage (to allow players to experience a bit of low-security space without being totally safe).i agree with this one. since concord isn't there, the pirate organizations would flourish. we could have npc 0.0 space be devoted to semi-empire groups (ore, mordus, thukker, etc), and low-sec split up into criminal organizations. that's not to say that 0.0 won't have any pirate organizations, as there will always be scouting and resource harvesting groups in 0.0.makes sense. this is where boosters and such items could be sold, and maybe other new low-sec only items ('overloaded' mining crystals, etc).this one i can agree with under one stipulation: that people would be able to pay a premium to fly them. basically, take out part of the mission reward to compensate for each mission. otherwise, nobody would want to risk their precious ships, and we'd see them become less powerful than the us congress.i would like to see smuggling become a new profession in this game, and this would be a good way to do it. it would take a fair amount of coding to do though, and new skills would have to be introduced to compensate (such as eft already lists).i'm kinda on the fence about this one. it would allow people to fight opposed factions, creating a sort-of anti-pirate belt rat with special mechanics, but it wouldn't be essential to the core mechanics overhaul. sounds reasonable if the time permits tho.this one i'm against. if you want this low-sec region to be a criminal's dream, don't force it upon the high-security dwellers.you might consider creating a bypass (a special gate mechanic that would allow the ships instant passage across the low-sec region for a price). this way, npc goods from warring factions would cost more, but you wouldn't have the forced risk of transportation and lack of trust which pervades player interactions in this game.overall, your ideas are pretty refreshing, similar to the recent las vegas conference ccp had. the main thing that needs to change is the rewards ratio in low-security space, as it currently doesn't pay enough to be in low-sec. tentatively supported."
1/10/2010,"maybe, although this needs to go hand in hand with updated station-hugging mechanics. i can see that having no sentries may be beneficial but may become too much of an advantage for the ""overlords."" in addition there would need to have a huge mechanic included which would involve pretty much an entire expansion.yes, there should be pirate agents in lowsec, lvl 1-4 and more of those inty ones.in addition, level 4 agents over quality 6 or so should be placed in lowsec. possibly even over q0yep i suggested this one in c&p . boosters, implants, hardwires, pirate faction ammunition and modules... all should be in lowsec only. this might be going too far, although the sale of those ships should be illegal.yepnpc pirates that interact? it'd be too much. there are plenty of prats to go around that ransom. what's needed is a ransom icon on the ""selected item"" window. when pressed against a target, the other player has some sort of notification (not an intrusive chat window) but maybe some kind of blinking dialogue box. if the victim pays the ransom, the pirate loses its lock for 3-5 seconds or so. this could also be logged and placed for a true ransom board. it would also make honoring ransoms more of a probability, without forcing pirates to actually ransom.i've thought about this, however it would only isolate people and not solve the issue, for example to run from jita-rens it's a long hisec only route, and a much shorter cut through but ""carebears"" will still prefer the long way most of the time.there needs to be more of an incentive, a tortuga-like atmosphere. incarna can build on this a bit by allowing gambling and ""banned"" activities in stations.larger pirate corps need motivation to ""claim"" a system, extort players but in the same breath protect their investment. the possibility is there.forget removing wtz and complaining about that, it's here to stay. fix station camping, and teach people how to avoid smartbombing battleships (it's too easy people, too easy...)"
1/10/2010,"edit in response to cyberman:these are the new just for gallente experimental storylines which send you 12 to 25 jumps, the last 2 to 5 in low sec systems in fw space to destroy enemy base\ships. these are being handed out to pve players, including non-combat pilots who are grinding courier and\or mining missions. it is making it very very difficult to get faction gains for gall and most players are just dropping storyline missions. as a way to get pve players to consider fw and low sec it is crass, blunt and stupid idea which shows very little understanding of the mission runner player base. i have put my comments in two threads:"
1/10/2010,"strongly supported. although i only had to go two jumps into low-sec when i got this mission, i still turned the mission down due to the 'bring friends' statement. storyline missions should include a bit of risk (evident by the low-sec courier missions with 40k m3 cargo). however, this was just downright stupid."

1/10/2010,"not supported. personally, i love playing fps with the classic keyboard + mouse combo, i find console controllers tolerable, but sluggish. however.i would rather play a multiplayer fps on a console these days, for the same reason i stick to single player in pc rts games, and mainly play mmo games; cheaters. cheating is certainly possible on consoles, but it's far more difficult, and if im going to enter into a contest of skill, the playing field better be bloody well even.i can play four or five awesome rounds in a row on pc, and then one turd logs into the server and ruins everyone's evening with a wallhack, an aimbot or some other form of asshattery.i'd rather deal with a slightly sluggish controller.as a final note, cost isnt an issue these days for consoles; you can buy a secondhand 360 premium for 100 quid, and xbox live is dirt cheap if you buy a 12 month sub. the new models of both the 360 and ps3 are actually pretty reliable, so if you do your research and buy the latest versions they'll last a good few years.htfu and buy a secondhand 360."

1/10/2010,"lot of confusion in this thread about what is an ""isk sink"" and ""isk facet"". basically if isk goes to ccp- its a sink. if isk comes from ccp its a facet.i support this ""conditionally"". its a bit more complex then just a yes or no. only ccp knows the extent per day of the current isk sinks/facets. one would assume any sinks lost would have to be replaced- or facets reduced to compensate.the obvious solution is to increase the cost of skillbooks- not sure if this would be enough to compensate. maybe do away with items that are ""only"" npc traded (ie made by npc and bought by npc)so the condition attached to my yea vote is i would want to know from ccp what the options are. if we do x- we must also do y. only then will i know for sure if its something i can support.interesting side note- this will buff null sec manufacturing operations the most. which explains why so many csm members are supporting it. which isnt to say buffing null sec manufacturing is a bad thing- just saying lets not disguise this issue in ""good for everyone"" rhetoric."

1/10/2010,"so basically, you want to make missioning in lowsec even more suicidal."
1/10/2010,"my declaration of shame was no understatement, quite obviously, and your ""reply"" is again useless and pointless, and still completely off topic... but what do i know, after all my post average is 2 per year, let's say, whilst you for example drake, post something like 5 times a day again:- acceleration gates are a burden. a simple ""fix"" is to allow players to bookmark and warp, once they cleared the room. you don't want mwds? but you don't want mwds because you have a problem with salvaging, not with the missions. so why hijacking the thread if not for egocentrical, stupid reasons?- only an imbecile would not agree that an increase in graphical quality and effects would affect the community positively as a whole. simple 2d particles and effects would be a great addition to make fights more visually appeasing, so that the game is more attractive to new players as well.again, please refrain from writing stupidities. it's ridiculous that there's not even support for the graphical additions."
1/10/2010,"proposal is unclear and needs further explanation.what happens if pockets 1-4 are clear and guy warps to a probed or fleeted mission runner in pocket 5? will he arrive at pocket 1's gate, or at pocket 4's gate? in the latter case, that will make it hell for fleeted salvagers. in the former case, it has no effect?it's a nerf to mission isk income if it prevents friendly salvagers entering the gate chain from the start. so you have to choose when you warp to a guy, if you warp to him or his first gate? explain how this will work. massive boost to griefing of mission runners. this doesn't really benefit mission runners, the majority of which use ravens and drakes that have no good reason to fit an mwd and a lot of reason not to (raven's capacitor problems plus the fact that even drakes have 60km missile range). it would hugely benefit people entering missions with pvp-fitted combat ships, e.g. ninjas.nice idea, adding graphics is always good."
1/10/2010,"thanks for the sound reply.for starters, i understand the objection of mwd usage... but if ninjas or pirates can use it, you can too. i might not completely grasp the consequences, but my opinion is that it'd be not much different from now: if you're fitted for pve, you'll be in a sad spot against pvp... regardless. in any manner, i'd expect to be able to use mwds simply if there'd be no modification to the sad, current state of acceleration gates access and fruition.in particular, my idea is that, letting aside sci-fi, once you clear a room (there are already ""interrupts"" for this, mission side, since many gates are unusable if you don't kill all enemies) that room's space becomes ""bookmarkable"". of course, if you don't bookmark, you warp to the first gate as usual.further analizing my friends woes however, i believe that it'd be even better if you could bookmark the last mission room you've been into, since this would allow you to experiment with various tactics and approaches thus allowing more variety and fun, consequently."
1/10/2010,"i don't have a gameplay problem with allowing a mission runner to warp back to his current room. it won't cause the ""jeremy tacs problem"" where griefers can shortcut to the final objective and steal it.i am indifferent to mwds in missions, but the fact is that the current missile based raven-hull mission fits simply don't benefit from an mwd and pvp does. now that i think about it there are a few mission fits that might benefit from an mwd, for example, ham tengu or sentry dominix.also there aren't many missions with long gate travel and in most cases it takes about as long to kill the npc as it does to reach the gate.overall i don't care either way for either, but you need to be aware that adding mwds in missions is a huge change the likes of which probably tips balance away from missioners."
1/10/2010,you started off ok but then began calling people names for not agreeing. if gates cause people like you to leave the game then i'd like to make a counter proposal that we add more gates.supporting adding more gates to get rid of people like you.inappropriate comments removed.steviesg
1/10/2010,"not supported.-acceleration gates are used to set up certain tactical circumstances, which might be broken by bookmarks, as well as to reduce the ease with which mission runners get scanned down. besides, there are very strong lore reasons why acceleration gates cannot be skipped. other posters have covered this in greater detail.-microwarpdrives would allow for speed tanking, which i imagine ccp would like to discourage, as it would greatly influence how players run missions. it would also greatly improve the ability of suicide gankers, lowsec pirates, and ninja looters to get to you.-current graphics tend to be optimized for performance, which is a major concern in a game with thousand-man fleet fights. what you suggest could negatively impact this, especially if the server has to ""keep track of littered shell casings""."

1/10/2010,i support it fully and this guy has a good idea of how to do it
1/10/2010,i'd wait until the rockets fix before saying that the ship itself is broken. its dps is actually comparable to sabre's even now. and it doesn't really have the grid for seven turrets anyways.
1/10/2010,"so you're asking for a remote salvaging device with a range of possibly over 120km? that's ludicrous...especially considering that the salvager takes a high slot. this would make many ships entirely too powerful (drake with missiles for damage and salvage drones so it doesn't even have to move).i'm sorry, but they were right to remove salvager drones from the equation completely. the salvager is limited in that it requires a high slot, a good amount of cpu, and only has a 5km range. adding drones to that task would mean almost nobody would equip the actual salvagers.sorry, i can't support this."
1/10/2010,"go to the wreck at 120 km at mdw speed, 5.000 m/s, return at loaded speed, 200 m/s. total 624 seconds. really overpowered."
1/10/2010,"i was thinking of a technical solution to the problem, not ccp's deliberate encouragement of asshattery as a profession."
1/10/2010,"after recalculating the math, i realize that the drone wouldn't necessarily be fast. however, it would seem to have too few disadvantages compared to the high-slot salvager. unless there was a way to balance it so the salvager isn't deprecated, i'm still against the idea."
1/10/2010,"the ship makes it there in 500 seconds, the drone takes 624(and of course, bookmarking, docking up, and getting a destroyer takes less than 200) the ship can take in a whole cluster of wrecks, the drones have to do each one individually. the ships can loot, the drones can only salvage. and in order to get up to 120km, you need to dedicate a minimum of three high slots to drone range extension, which is actually a fair bit harder to fit than a traditional salvage fit. i don't believe that salvage drones are necessary, or particularly wise. i don't like turning a collectable into a commodity and messing up the people who are holding the books, either. but the arguments you raise really aren't very good ones."
1/10/2010,"alot of people seem to think thay would be to over powered due to range ect. well there is a simple fix, that is to limit there range to say 50-60km and 4000m/s(with max drone range sills) for those of you who don't know. a marauder's tractor range is already 40km. then to give reason for the shorter range and speed have some kind of tech babble in the description for ex ""due to the installation of a salvage device, and increased cargo hold the control receiver and propulsion systems had to be reduced. limiting this drones operational range and speed when compared to other drone types"" or something along those lines.tho i do support topic and hope ccp can figure out a way for them to work."
1/10/2010,"no, not because that this would be a bad idea (i myself am a drone user with nearly 10mil sp in drones), but because i generally don't like features which support and assist solo play (meaning playing with as less interaction with other players as possible, with none at all the best). eve is a mmorpg, or at least should be, not a solo pc-game."
1/10/2010,"ok, i accept your position even if i don't totally agree, sorry for the heavy sarcasm in my reply. the balance is strongly dependant on the drone size and chance of success.i see them as a 10 m3 drones with a decent capacity. one of the problems will be the volume of the salvage. several bs, even if the salvage really dropped has a small volume, have a potential maximum volume of salvage over 100 m3 and for the salvager to work the ship must have 100 or more m3 free. for dedicated use it could be even possible to have 3 size of drones with different maximum cargo capacity: small for frigate/destroyer wrecks, medium for cruiser/bc, large for bs and above. naturally that would require a way to identify the different wreck size without the need to memorize the name of all different npc.honestly probably too much work for a small gain.the option of a tractor drone as suggested above seem simpler (again with speed limitations when loaded)."
1/10/2010,"this only applies to empire faction and 'mission generic' wrecks, it doesn't apply to 'normal' npc wrecks, which don't ever drop scrap metal.salvage uses up 0.01m3/unit regardless of type.you can send one drone to each wreck individually, and could technically have a tag-along alt in a vexor carrying dps drones for when there's ships about and salvager drones for when there aren't, with nothing but drone link augmentors in its highs and a buffer+resists in its lows (with rr on the mission-runner's ship; he doesn't need to run his local tank while his alt is the one getting shot at, so cap-stability is between a non-issue and of little enough consequence that it's not valid in the argument).now if we instead look back to the guy that uses one account; he can warp on in afterwards (the way he would in his thrasher), in a vexor that can still achieve ~1.75km/s with a ~6s agility using a mwd, allowing it to quickly and efficiently nip around, sending 5x salvager drones after wrecks further away while it deals with 5x wrecks closer to its own location (it even gets to lock all of those wrecks provided the pilot has trained targeting lvl5 and multitasking a bit, and is using signal amplifier iis in its lows).the vexor even has a 480m3 cargohold, allowing it to hold a fair chunk of the more-valuable loot. it just won't get to fit salvage tackle this way (destroyer can) or tractor things around (destroyer can, again), but then, you're already talking about using a drone that wouldn't benefit from salvage tackle, that would need its own skill to use and that will not loot for you.so on the whole, a 'salvage drone' looks like nothing but a fluff-addition that will either be useless, overpowered or limited to the point of frustration for a large portion of the playerbase.demonstrate to me why this kind of addition is necessary."
1/10/2010,16*3m dmg = 48m dmg. 16 titans are enough to (almost) one volley your 40m ehp titan fit. given the number of titans it had in the y-2 battle i wouldnt wonder if some of the pl titans got obliterated that way.
1/10/2010,signed!
1/10/2010,"the background for this is that a while ago i was considering putting training on hold with my main to avoid having to move to the next grade of clone, simply because it would double the cost of clone upgrade when inevitable poddings occur. it seems to me that the costs of clones is too high, and with little reason.eve is not a game where more skillpoints = much greater power, just as larger ships are not in all situations better than smaller ships. after a certain point, one trains more skills to diversify one's abilities, not to become better at a particular area. a character with 10mil sp can be as good an interceptor pilot as one with 100mil, but the character with 100mil sp has to pay the cost of an interceptor for a new clone every time s/he is podded.there are arguments against changing the costs, of course. one is that if one can't afford to lose a pod, don't undock. this is true, but it does restrict significant proportions of gameplay. fleet interdiction involves almost certain podding, as (to a lesser extent) does any large-scale fleet action, where lag often means that one has died and been podded before one's client even registers the first loss of shields.that any character sufficiently invested in the game to have 70+mil sp should have more than enough money to pay seems to be another. however, isk/hour earning is related far less to the number of skillpoints a character has than to many other factors. after one reaches a certain level in a particular area, many of the isk sources in eve are only slightly affected by additional skills. l4 missions may be run slightly faster by a character with skills for a marauder, but the isk/hour difference will not be that different to a much lower-skilled character running missions in a cnr.i would suggest that the cost of medical clones should be capped at 0.1isk/sp, or 100k per million skillpoints. current costs are listed at:"
1/10/2010,"i know that this will probably be part of a broader fix of pos mechanics(should that glorious day ever come...), but on the chance that this can be fixed with a smaller patch than would be necessary to fix the pos system entirely, i'll propose this as a separate change. current situation: when a pos tower has less than 24 hours of fuel left, all directors get a notification that looks like the following:a follow-up notification is sent every hour, until the tower is either refuelled above 24h or offline. other than in these mails, fuel status can be checked by going to the tower in person, or via api. api gives only fuel levels, while looking in person shows consumption rates. there is a page in the corporate assets window for pos structures, but no ability to check fuel levels there, nor even any ability to tell which structures are attached to which tower. proposed change: the corp assets in space page will be changed significantly. towers will get a location listed(system/moon, instead of just system), and there will be a ""fuel remaining"" column for towers - a single number, which can be right-clicked to give a full status report like you get from being physically at the tower now. in addition to the lists of structures grouped by system, there will also be a group of low-fuel towers, so that they can all be seen at a glance. starbase fuel technicians will not be able to see the full list of structures(for security), but they will be able to see the low-fuel list. fuel notifications will be changed from hourly to there being only two - one at 24 hours, one at 6 hours. these fuelmails will be sent to starbase equipment managers and starbase fuel technicians in addition to directors, and will contain information on consumption rates and time remaining for all fuels, sorted by time remaining. benefits: it would make the godawful process of fuelling pos towers at least 20% less painful, and lower spam significantly. reduced notifications will also have a slight benefit as regards server load. drawbacks: more information provided will generally mean more server load. it's not known whether this will outweigh the reductions from fewer notifications."

1/10/2010,"i think suicide ganking is cool.what i'd like to see, is only paying accounts be able to fire at ""protected"" targets in high sec, though.it sucks that people make bull**** accounts for this purpose; let them eat the training time on a paid account, imo.might have a side-effect of making the game more newb friendly by protecting them from concording themselves during trial period."
1/10/2010,"i will go with this not only will it stop ""insurance jobs"" in hi-sec but hopefully make suicide gankers atleast think twice (or maybe once) before popping someone."
1/10/2010,"removing insurance will make little change to ganking.before you say i am mad, here's why.a fitted gank cruiser without insurance would be 8 million isk lost. it needs 16 million cargo in an industrial for that cruiser to pay. but, because of the sec status loss and the 15 minute countdown the threshold for ganking them is already 50 or 100 million, so there's no change there. a fitted gank destroyer is 1 million isk to buy and another 1 million isk for modules. that's a 2 million isk loss with no insurance. 6 pilots paying 2 million each for destroyers can gank a hulk. one pilot can pay 2 million to kill a covetor. even the covetor pilot will lose more than that (strip miners are over 1 million each). 2 million isk? that's 4 rat bounties. i just did a mission that paid 20 million. i'd pay 2 million in an instant to see the rage in local chat.i don't need to buy plex but even if i had to, i'd pay usd 15 to do it 120 times. put a coin in the box, random emo ragequit chat comes out other side, 1 in 10 makes you laugh your ass off. at 10 cents per go, it's cheaper than cable tv.people saying suicide gankers are exploiting insurance might have a point, but fixing that won't stop the ganking. in fact i don't think it will reduce at all.if you want to change something to fix ganking, increase the sec status loss. it's still possible to gank with ""outlaw"" status but it's much more troublesome as you can't sit on a high sec gate all day."

1/10/2010,"it's not to remove suicide ganking, this is only to make it a genuine risk vs. reward type of thing.that's all. insurance should not be paid out for being concorddokken'd.that's it. make it so it's an actual risk and you are gambling isk and security status. carebears shouldn't be safe, not by any means, but at the same time, you can churn out alts in your accounts (you get 2 other than your main) and have them ready to suicide and dispose of. that's not even having multiple accounts (which i'm positive like 20% of people do).if you guys are clueless how easy it is to pop someone in a t1 hauler carrying anything above 50million in value then that's your issue, but at present, it provides to be a no brainer to make tons of isk with no loss.and, before anyone says anything else dumb, no, i didn't get popped to make this thread, i just am tired of seeing folks profit from no-risk insurance scams that often times just prey on newbies because, as i just said, no risk.most billionaires/veterans are flying t2 haulers or freighters, like myself and there is risk in hitting us."
1/10/2010,"as with any nerf that happens in eve its disapointing for those of us used to a certain setup, but we get over it eventualy and with all the nerfs ive always wonderd why take away , why not add stuff for other ships instead, understandably the complications for the programers would be higher, but not unobtainable. the same i could say for all bpos the market is a joke and has been for years, they added t2 to make a change , then made t2 invention (a great thing in my books) but it still is not the backbone of eve t1 ships still cost less and work fine for the most part but they too cost more to build than you can get them on the market(wtf), a easy fix would be to create classes of players by adding skills requierd for all bpos each one a diff skill set. in doing this the t2 bpo owners /inventors would have to spec more skills in the field they want to build, the pirates and mission runners would have to cross train skills in order to build there own ammo/ships etc. or just keep training the pvp skills and buy all there ammo/ships. each factions skills spec could vary so as to create more competition .granted this will only be a temp fix for the market but over time they could make t2 bpos break down and slowly become unusable while at the same time introducing more bpc drops for the t3 ships this will however help the separation of the classes and i think make eve more ballanced for everyone. ive always said you can build a bs with a one day old account if given the stuff to do it with , thats comparable to me going into my back yard with a shovel , digging up some dirt , bringing it inside and building a ford or a kia and if i read a few books for 3 months i could build a ferrari. so for ccp to do us all a favour i say add more skills for building and have the t2 bpos break down at a random pace, so one day all that will be left is a bpo thats a collectors item and is unusable. if not then have the invention have a randomness that can include perfect runs and with the chance of a perfect me with up to 20 builds regardless of what you put in but improving if you add the various items or item quality"

1/10/2010,"when you start in eve and learn about the t2 lottery and the bpo's it makes you angry, that you missed out and that likely you can't afford the hundreds of millions or billions that these bpo's sold/sell for.after you learn more about the game and invention, especially if you actually do it, you understand that while bpo holders don't have to do all the invention bs (if they don't want) as an inventor your manufacturing is more flexible and adaptive to the market. you can stock up your invented bpc's for a batch job while still inventing more bpc's ofthe same thing or another. they are stuck making that one thing over and over trying to recoup the costs with buying it or just printing isk so to speak if they actually 'won' the lottery. if they are smart they are also inventing as unless someone has several t2 bpo they can't capitalize on the market an inventor can by being flexible. i don't have to make the t2 item if i don't want to i can sit on the bpc where a t2 bpo holder has to make it and sell it to make isk or they are wasting time 'sitting' on it whether they are not producing or copying it. i'm not doing that, sitting on a bpc i can make it and sell it or sit on it while i make other bpc's. the time involved in copying a t2 bpo makes it less profitable than just making the item, unless they a reason to take that 'loss'.tldr: get over t2 bpo's, someday ccp might want to listen to some players and turn them into limited production bpc's but it really isn't needed. inventors can and do make isk, they have more options to produce and aren't stuck 'paying off a loan' in the form of a expensive bpo they purchased by having to produce from it for years constantly. *i hold not t2 bpo's and wouldn't buy one ever cause it is a waste of isk."

1/11/2010,"i tend to agree with you. blaster boats could be a low range, average-tracking dps monster and fill a good niche role utilizing tackle and approach to reduce transversal and apply signficanlty more dps at short range. minmatar have a wide range variety that they function at (better performance inside tracking of other races or outside range of gallente)in short-range weapon engagements:minmatar would win the fast-orbiting short range fightsamarr win the medium range slugfestsgallente rip things apart if they get up close and control movementthey do need more than the current 10% difference though and the ability to fit a bit more tank or a faster base speed (i'd lean toward the latter). it'd take a lot of playtesting to determine the ""magic numbers"" but having 20% better base damage than other races and more inertia but significantly more thrust might be an interesting direction to go. they can get within range faster but still require significant tackling to keep minmatar from outmaneuvering them while amarr still try to kite and kill on approach.personally, i think most of the amarr op cries are due to the tracking of pulses and reducing that a bit to give us worse short-range dps against fast targets might be warranted but the mid range dps with scorch and a low-heavy slot layout are the only selling points of the whole amarr fleet (no ammo for structure bashing is kinda nice too but not extremely important in the long run). if you take that away then the whole race is useless.laser ships do have some disadvantages but i think the biggest difference is that all of ours tend to have the same solution: ""bring other ships to the fight too"" while the issues of blaster boats (more travel time and shorter range) are only magnified as the number of ships involved in the fight increases. gallente do make significantly better solo ships than amarr (the curse being an exception) but amarr make better fleet ships.* armor tanked t2 minmatar ships laugh at you and your pathetic attempts to damage them with em/therm.* t1 amarr ships are mostly one-trick ponies with the same trick. they have good wide-range dps and good tank but no real utility or variation beyond gank-focused, tank-focused, or ""both but hard to fit"".* amarr ships have very few midslots. most can't tackle for themselves and still operate a prop mod for any significant time period or larger ships have to drop the useful sensor booster.* amarr ships are generally quite slow since we can't ever get away with a dcii instead of a plate (mostly relevant on sub-bs ships).* amarr ships often have little dronebay space.* nothing resembling useful ewar outside the curse (gallente can't claim *much* better ewar but it is better).* long range weapons are useful too and come with the ""race selection"" package. fly more with larger groups and you'll see more megathrons out on the field, though i think apocs still usually outnumber them.* cap bonus instead of combat bonus on many ships.laser *ships* have disadvantages over hybrid ships, please stop taking a turret away from its ship layouts and bonuses unless you're also going to say that nothing in eve can successfully fit lasers because they suck your hurricane/drake cap dry in seconds. blasters need a buff, but if you take scorch + long range pulses out of the picture then amarr are going to need a base dps boost to make up for the massive loss of effective range and then we would be stepping on your toes even more."
1/11/2010,"all of the below assumes it is a small engagement (3 or less on each side). blasters and autos are not fleet weapons and pulses rule medium gang warfare (5-10 on each side) when used in quantity. long range weapons are more useful for anything larger.i don't think tracking vs other long range weapons is the problem. you can easily run under the guns of any long range weapon system without running under your own. if you can't pull this off, just keep reminding youself that you don't need to run at full speed at all times.for short range guns it doesn't matter if you do *your* max dps unless unless you'll cap out before they die otherwise. if you are doing more dps at a given range than they are then you are winning the dps portion of the fight. if you are fighting amarr, run in close and take the tracking penalty because it will hurt them much more than you. sadly, minmatar autos have comparable range and better tracking than you so reduce your transversal as much as possible and try to stay within your range so you can apply more dps than their autos.as an amarr pilot, i seldom orbit unless i'm facing someone with larger than me or with long range weapons. i either keep at range or start running away immediately, otherwise i'll hurt myself more than him/her. i haven't used blasters since pre-rmr days so i can't say they are/aren't balanced but i hate it when people complain that ""i can't click on orbit at my optimal and kill stuff"" like the other ship isn't supposed to shoot back.the lachesis is a very special case in that its ewar puts it in a very spoecific band of ranges (close enough to disrupt and far enough to be untargetable) where lasers hit perfectly. the ferox gets a range bonus, no damage bonus, and a tank bonus: a set of bonuses that are generaly associated with a large fleet ship, which it would perform better at if it were an armor tank."

1/11/2010,"okay this is an issue with caldari/missiles i have griped about for years and years and no one has really supported it. i'm glad you made this post because missiles in their current state are boring and borderline broken.caldari ships should get a bonus to all missiles... because missiles are missiles, you shouldn't be stuck using 1 type of missile to get your bonuses.. that's just stupid. it makes all other missile types generally undesirable.. what's the point of having 4 types of missiles when the missile race gets a bonus to only 1 of them?let's racially diversify missiles, similar to drones.. kinetic should be the top end missile in terms of pure dps.. probably followed by amarr (khanid of course).. then probably minmatar/gallente.. could even tweak stuff like explosive velocity, explosive radius, velocity, racially.. but for overall dps i would make the kinetic missile king, just the equivalent of thermal drones for gallente.. i would like to see missiles be based on mostly kinetic damage with some of the other damage types mixed in.. honestly i would rather say a missiles damage would be mostly kinetic based. that would make switching missiles useful but still for the most part the missile is delivering kinetic damage.. thus ensuring caldari ships are racially inclined to dealing kinetic damage.. maybe 60/40 ratio kinetic/other type.i also wouldn't mind seeing missiles do more alpha damage with a slower rate of fire to compensate since missiles generally do take up more cargo space than ammo.. annnd last but not least just to really gripe it up here, i wish missiles would get better effects.. the whole shooting 1 blob of glowing crap out of your ship from the same spot gets kinda old.. i wish missiles looked cooler, seems like every other weapon in the game got effects upgrades so why not missiles?"
1/11/2010,"the mere fact that nobody uses caldari ships other than the drake for pvp (and only because it has an amazing tank - albeit a shield-tank at that) should be an exceptionally vivid example of why the hull bonuses need to be changed.i don't want to come off sounding like a ""buff my race!"" pilot here, so i will try to explain my position. the fact is, being able to switch ammo types is not enough.first, caldari ships are some of the slowest ships in the game.caldari ships tend to have the smallest drone bays.caldari ships also tend to have the weakest armor tanks of any of the ships in the game.this is fine, they don't have to worry about tracking problems, being disrupted, being out of range (not in most situations anyways), and they will always hit their target (with at least a fraction of the potential damage) while in range.so having the advantage of switching out ammo types seems like a bonus, but it is not. changing damage types to aim for the resistance holes (especially in small gang and solo pvp) means you are sacrificing hull bonuses, as well as thousands of damage points inflicted while your weapons load. amarr don't have this problem switching crystals, and minmatar pilots have the advantage of being able to maneuver themselves out of bad tactical situations, while gallente ships can fall back on drones that have incredible range. on top of this, one of the reasons behind flying caldari ships is that they don't necessarily need to be outfitted for a specific optimal range, whereas minmatar and gallente ships are, and when something cannot be engaged in favorable tactical situations, it simply isn't.caldari ships should not have to avoid engagement because of the fact that they will first have to worry about the dropped hull bonuses, and then later a massive loss in continuous dps while you reload to an ammo type that helps you ravage the resistance holes in your adversary. on the contrary, the sheer loss in damage dealt while ammo types are switched out will more than make up for the increase in damage you do using the new ammo type, minus the hull bonus. i would heartily say rof bonuses need to be given."

1/11/2010,"i think it would make missiles more interesting personally but to each their own.the only problem here is that though caldari by far do have the best shields in the game, a huge flaw in the game right now is that 3 races ships are mostly armor based and only 1 race is shield-centric.. which is kind of annoying for rr. i never did like the whole shield tanking vs armor tanking thing.. i have to wonder why amarr ships have shields at all.."

1/11/2010,"also to empire dweller, since i cant quote 2 people at once... so this is about his smartbomb rubbish too.here go the hisec emo boys.. if you read the post, it is not about pirating you rich folk of hisec, its about making lowsec a better playing environment for those who want to live there. if you dont want risk, dont go to lowsec, it isnt as though hisec is small...also, i have never lit a smartbomb in my life, ive never even fitted one, check my corp on battleclinic if you like, you will see it full of combat ships flown by combat organisations. and they wont be in the losses section, so please be quiet on this one.so, can we have comments and ideas from the people who live in lowsec, not the ones whod like to make it safe."
1/11/2010,"ive got to say, i really like some of the ideas here.ever since ccp mentioned talk of a criminal underworld element being discussed, ive allways thought that has to be lowsec.this, in my opinion, would become popular.it would also offer a real feeling of being in dangerous space.needs discussion, but supported!"
1/11/2010,"next people are going to demand that market buy/sell orders on inactive accounts automatically become 'paused' and invisible on the market...i'm mixed on supporting or not supporting this, but honestly considering the significant amount of work involved in gaining access to the worth-while agents and the fact that, if it were done on such a massive scale, there would be an 'issue' in datacore supply/demand ratios (read: there isn't; there's such an excess of supply that 0.01isk order warfare is almost more common than that for tritanium/pyerite).as it stands, while any given account is inactive farming the rp, the owner cannot cash in the rp to get the datacores. when he does, someone (or even a few people) may do the same at roughly the same time, and the two people will end up having reactivated a whole bunch of accounts they do nothing else with purely to flood an already saturated market with a commodity nobody needs to buy anymore (because they either already have supplies of datacores from exploration that they can't sell off or they are doing the exact same thing anyway).on the flipside this would hurt the lower-key guys that are trying to farm rp for invention purposes rather than for direct-trade purposes; whether they intend to invent for personal/corp/alliance use or to sell the end product(s) to the market instead.so actually no, i can't support this; hurts the fat-cats 'abusing' the system at the same time as the start-up players trying to find a viable means of making a bit of extra isk."
1/11/2010,"uh, no, the fat-cats abusing the system are the ones hurting the people trying to make some extra isk, they are the ones who flood the 'stable' market of players cashing in and selling datacores. the people who log in once a year to collect datacores from x accounts hurt the people trying to make some isk from datacores but who actually play and supply them year round. they are the ones who trade them to a main and can sell off their stockpile year round but are likely more motivated to take less cause their main's running out of game time. having only paid to activate the account and collect the datacore their research point farmers go back to sleep until next time."
1/11/2010,"and only the 'fat-cats' can do this, right?if everyone can do it, but some choose not to, then that's not a flaw of game-mechanics, it's a human error.what do those accounts do when they've been activated for a month? only one character can train for 32 or so days before it becomes inactive again. chances are good that the initial game-time investment to train all three characters on the account as well as grind standings by-proxy for them took more than a 1-month sub initially, especially since the more characters are splitting up standings gains, the more missions you have to run to get the personal standings; then you still have to grind the faction standings element (which is high for the lvl4 agents) on the character itself.those people had to work to get their various characters to be able to use that many research agents at once. if they bought characters that could already do that, then the person they bought the characters from had to work for it, and isk is still changing hands in what i believe is a very alive market for rp generation characters.why should this kind of limitation be imposed on purely inactive accounts? someone may have two characters on their ""main's"" account that do nothing but purely this; fair enough that account is paid for, but that's two essentially inactive characters if they are used for purely rp grinding.alternatively they could have this going on an account purely bred for afk mining with rp generation on the side, or even just for an orca alt.why should other forms of afk play have it easy while this doesn't?and before you pull the 'you must be a fat-cat' card, i have a grand total of two agents right now in amo and hek - i got too tired of the insanely mind-numbing grinding to get access to the agents after i'd already run hundreds of thousands in lp worth of missions for minmatar, and never skipped a storyline mission, and then still had to get those personal standings via lvl1/2 agents - there are other ways to make afk isk in eve that i prefer utilizing."
1/11/2010,"because you can't afk mine on an inactive account. pay for the account and you get three character slots to use for whatever you wish. if someone wants to pay for 3 accounts with all 9 character generating maximal datacores, they should be allowed to."
1/11/2010,"and indeed they can. if you're willing to train 9 different characters to grind datacores across 3 active accounts, i have absolutely no issue with that, as long as you're actually paying for those accounts to be run. hell, pay for them with plex, i don't care. but pay for them."
1/11/2010,"again no, i used your term 'fat-cats' because you used it as an argument that doing this would hurt the fat-cats and the 'start-up players' trying to get into farming datacores for some extra isk. as i said the little guy isn't the one setting up several dedicated accounts to farm datacores, lets them go inactive, then activates them when it is time to collect or they need to sell datacores to buy plex etc. a 'little guy' would more likely have their main do this and not do the unrealistic level 5 bs someone mentioned in this thread and grinding standings with the best lv4 r&d agents out there because some 'extra isk' doesn't require that kind of effort. but i have no problem with someone wanting to keep rp farming accounts active, it is the inactive collection of rp that is what needs to be fixed.it is a flaw of game mechanics since it started, why? well ccp chose to not let players character benefit when the account isn't active, benefit how?, in the collection or accumulation of 'things' you can clearly see the parallel between a character continuing to train for a month and one that keep collecting research points, the rp keep going forever. it makes no sense where you character can't finish out the skill queue now, what is the max 2-3 months on a skill? but you can continue to collect research points for years if you so choose. nothing else works like this in eve, going on 'forever' whether you are there or not, or ever come back. as far as those that 'worked' to get their army of alt rp farming accounts up they took advantage of this game mechanic 'too bad' it is long overdue that this was corrected, ghost training, imo was the catalyst for it. they have been getting 'paid' for their work what since t2 lottery ended?, i never said set the rp to 0 like someone suggested just stop it when the account is inactive. some players chose to make characters grind standings and train skills for whatever time, 2-3 months, longer if they were really greedy so they could sit back and collect rp by doing nothing but paying for a month, their choice not mine. they can always sell them on the character bazaar, nothing is stopping that, activate the account, post an ad, collect datacores, trade to main, sell the character you got paid again for all your 'work'. why limit it to inactive accounts, because they are gaining for nothing, it is that simple, the active accounts doing this pay for the game plex, or real money on subscription. you are free to kill your price checker alt, contract scamming alt, or forum alt and trade your rp farmer over to your main account as well or just sell it as an inventor/farmer. comparing an alt on the same account to a secondary account that collects rp while that account isn't being paid for and the alt is makes no sense. by that logic we should be paying for every alt we have on our main accounts as well, 1 character per account, brilliant. i don't follow what you mean 'other forms of afk play have it easy while this doesn't' what other afk play allows you to gain by not paying for the game for months and earn items worth isk? maybe i'm too new the only thing i can think of is character farming but that has been nerfed as you need to keep the account active (pay) to train. are you speaking of botting/macroing, those are against eula i'm for ccp stopping them too and feel they have a pretty easy way of finding them since most bots do it vigorously so it easy to profile and investigate those accounts."
1/11/2010,"in light of a new year and a bump of the salvage discussion in the general forum, i ll feel the need to bump this. i havent heared yet that the csm took this up into one of their sheduled meetings, though i might have missed it.song li, as you posted here to bring it up, please dont forget this :d ."
1/11/2010,"i support the following:1) wrecks can be scanned down with a deep space scanner probe (ie astrometrics v required to find wrecks)2) wrecks can only be scanned down outside of deadspace areas, inside they are not.3) ideally i'd like an additional skill rank 4-5 to narrow down wrecks but i don't see it happening w/o a special probe for this which i'd support.scanning down space salvage should be a more specialized profession and the rewards should have more hurdles to overcome not less, while making it harder for everyone to scan out the wrecks as i suggest it distinguishes the professional salvager from the opportunist. understand that once completed missions are turned in more salvage and loot will be readily available to anyone who trained the bare minimum to find it, so more modules/reprocessed minerals and salvage on the market. i think that should come with a cost of an extra skill to use a specialized probe in order to access this new bounty in space."
1/11/2010,"i really don't see the issue with passive recharge, you'll get that with extra shield anyway, it really is a non issue.surely this is about adding the hp boost when the bonus is applied, of which i fully support.two things to remember also, it's not only the shield tankers that get the bonus and the recharge rate slows down from 33% upwards.ex nyx pilot (another char)"

1/11/2010,i can answer you this question. ccp hates gallente. they hate it so much that they dont even intend to hide it.
1/11/2010,supported.a truly bad idea to sneak this experiment in.the design of the game play here shows that the eve storyline board have no understanding of pve'ers or have taken on board any of their comments in the mission and complexes threads.should have been put on the test server first.the paucity of implementation shows that the csm can not have been consulted.another example of appalling ccp customer service.
1/11/2010,"full support. it was idiots who made these missions, missions that do nothing but hurt gameplay. ccp put no thought into it these missions what so ever. a semi sensible way to do the missions world be to give the story agent a branching option. mission 1 is the normal storyline empire missions. branching option 2 is the low sec mission with a higher reward. although the new low sec missions still need re making as they are so poorly thought out.as a pve pilot i hate pvp, hate being pushed into pvp situations and i hate risking pve ships in pvp hotzones. we are pve pilots for a reason, we dont do and often dont like pvp. if i do these new stupid missions my standings drop below -2 and i can no longer fly with friends due to the caldari navy being after me. i dont have that problem with normal missons."
1/11/2010,/signed
1/11/2010,"i do believe that low-sec is an important part of the game. that some percentage of storyline missions are low-sec is an appropriate part of the game.pvp oriented players are fine w/ the innovation and i concur that pvp is an element of the game. conversely, would the pvp players be pleased with time-consuming, low-reward (for unit of time) trade missions flying huge payloads all over hell's half acre in high sec?that a new player learning the basics of ""skilling up"" and ship fitting should get a 13 jump l1 storyline combat mission with final jumps in a 0.3 and 0.2 system from an l1 agent is difficult. that it should occur 4x in 4 weeks suggests poor implementation by the developers. their own blog suggests strongly that this was a last minute addition to dominion.a newbie's mission-fit frigate has no business in low-sec on a storyline. let a willing newbie try out an appropriately fit low-cost frigate in low sec as s/he sees fit.if not removed entirely, these missions should at least be reviewed to determine if the frequency of assignment is appropriate.alternatively, reassigned to fw agents.supported."
1/11/2010,"i support the general proposal to remove these missions.from another thread on this:if, as ccp j says, they are keeping an eye on it, then they'll be seeing how many times i and others have declined the missions. story is important, but these missions are--as has already been stated numerous times--not worth the time and effort. low-sec, 10+ jumps, the meager rewards--it's just unappealing from every angle.as much as i appreciate eve's lore, the story to me is what happens as i engage other players in-game. hulkageddon is a story; the bob/goons war is a story; all the other major engagements in 0.0 are stories; my experiences in low-sec with my friends and corp mates make stories. all that stuff that happens among the factions in empire gets lost on me as background noise. yeah, gallente hates caldari. fantastic. woohoo. great. oh, you want me to go way the hell out there and risk my stuff for a little implant? no thanks."

1/11/2010,this problem/bug/feature has been around for far too long. would be great to finally see an overview filtering system that allows you to view just war targets or just hostiles or just neutrals or just friendlies.
1/11/2010,"issue supported. however, the commentary on how to actually fix it was completely ignored by myself. i don't care how ccp fixes/improves wt's on overview as long as the just make it easier/effective."
1/11/2010,"the best way i could see this working is just to have a toggle switch in the control tower which would just allow the guns to be ""unlocked"" to anybody in range of the tower. (or just remove guns from role permissions and use a password access.)also it would be useful if pos's could be anchored for self or corp (like warp disrupter bubbles) to allow player freedom to put up a personal pos without the security risk of granting full rights to all the corporate pos operations."
1/11/2010,we complained that fw had been abandon by ccp.so they gave us lp for pvp.we shut up and waited for the patch.it turned out to be fail.so they dropped more candy on the floor.problem is all the candy has been lil things designed only to reduce complaints.at no stage has anyone taken a serious look at fixing fw.agile scrum is neat and all but fw needs a permanent scrum.going years without having a single developer assigned to this major part of the game is crazy.
1/11/2010,"in what way do you demand in be done before dust? fw and dust have nothing to do with each other so your statement makes no sense other than to say you somehow believe that the development of dust by a separate division is somehow impacting the eve devs.is fw broken? yes.will jumping up and down and attempting to give deadlines that don't have anything related to what you're demanding help? no.your current proposal amounts to nothing more than ""fix it before you do x"", which is a useless proposal if presented to ccp. you want it to actually mean something then put some actual timelines in there. prioritize your ideas, throw in a ""we want to see change a in 3 months, b 3 months after, etc.""and be realistic."
1/11/2010,"supporting fw updates, but timing in relation to dust is irrelevant."

1/11/2010,insurance needs to be re-worked or elimintated.i don't think it is fair to the game for people to optimize loopholes and abuse it.
1/11/2010,"it's trivially obvious that ship insurance does provide a price floor (minus a small percentage for production costs, etc) for the aggregate value of minerals, since there's no real limit to the amount of minerals you can use this way. if insurance was not bouying the price of minerals then the aggregate price would have to be higher than the insurance value, since insurance is effectively an unlimited npc buy order.as the price of one mineral rises, the others fall to compensate. high-end minerals have been depressed far below their base value for 2 years now for the simple reason that vast quantities of them are easily available from the rats in drone space. (the huge amounts of high-ends available in w-space didn't help prices either) when i started playing back in 2006, zydrine and megacyte were a lot closer to their base values, and ships typically sold for 10-20% above net insurance value. after the drone regions opened, high end prices went in to free fall, and t1 ship prices sank to insurance value, never to rise more than 2-3% above it again.the facts are there for anyone to see."
1/11/2010,"short and sweet:there are shortcut keys to have drones engage a target, return and orbit, and return to the drone bay, but none to launch drones. i propose that a shortcut option be added to launch drones.greygal"
1/11/2010,wouldn't work since some people like carrier pilots carry many diffrent types. how would the hot key know what ones to launch.
1/11/2010,"so i've got a domi, and it's carrying five groups of drones - sentries, heavies, mediums, lights, and medium ecm. which group does the shortcut launch, and why?edit: thinking about it, a workaround presents itself. have an option to select a drone group as default(it can vary by ship, ideally), and have the shortcut launch that group. it's not all i'd want it to be, but for a lot of ships, it'll do the trick nicely."
1/11/2010,"good points - i'd forgetten about that :) most of the time i carry just one type with me, but there have been times when i've had several different types of drones with me and had to go through the folder/folders to select specific drones to launch.while i really wanted to keep the idea simple... perhaps it would be possible to add several basic, generic launch shortcut keys - such as launch scouts, launch heavies, launch reppers... (i'm being very generic here sorry!)and suddenly a simple idea becomes more complicated... sigh... :)greygal"
1/11/2010,"the current 24000byte limitation for forum signature images is pretty annoying. i can't think of that many people on 56k modems browsing the forum with images enabled so shouldn't be any drawbacks.so my proposal is to have this limitation changed to 75k byte so .png will be a viable format for signatures.edit - to clarify, the pixel limitation of 400x120 should stay as it is."
1/11/2010,supporting my own thread.
1/11/2010,"what kind of graphic do you want to use if you need 75k for it?huge graphics tend to make a site unreadable, because it's constantly loading and resizing to adjust to a dozen signatures being loaded."
1/11/2010,"if your connection is unable to handle a 75k image, how do you view pron?supported, increase the file size limitation but not the displayed pixel by pixel size, this allows better quality sigs without cluttering up the screen.and if it's seriously a major issue for anyone in the broadband era, they can use the handy function that turns of sigs."
1/11/2010,the fullsize version of my sig would be in the 60-70k range as it is .png and the only format supported by eveboard.com not to mention jpeg is pretty limited with no transparancy support.
1/11/2010,"the 24000 byte limitation was ok when a greater proportion of internet connections were 56k and the forums did not have a function to omit signature images. these days it is a nuisance, and i fully support the limit being raised to 75k (or 76000 bytes if eve mods don't want to memorise more than two significant digits).i do agree with the pixel size limit staying at 400 x 120 though."
1/11/2010,"sounds reasonable - any 400x120 still image should be acceptable. i don't want massive screen-breakers, or gaudy moving .gif files, but standard-sized sigs shouldn't be a problem."
1/11/2010,"75k sounds like an adequate bump without overloading people left and right.i would also not be opposed to an increase in visual size as long as it does not exceed 600 pixels in width and remains at the current height. considering monitors are getting wider as a standard (but not taller), it makes sense. especially considering most people play beyond the 800x screen resolution.edit for thumbs-up."
1/11/2010,"/signedi have two different machines with different hardware and operating systems and both of them have little to no combat sounds. i may hear my weapons fire 1 out of 50 times. combat is boring without sound effects. i also have a razer megalodon headset with its own sound card built in and this sound situation still happens every time i play eve. so that means 3 sound cards and the same issue on either my desktop speakers, laptop speakers or headphones.1st machine has windows vista 64 ultimate with a sound blaster xfi music (desktop)2nd machine has windows 7 64 ultimate with realtek audio onboard sound (alienware laptop)"
1/11/2010,"i'll support any thread proposing fixing of the sound engine.i'm not sure if it's that the game overwhelms the sound channels or what, but i multi-box two accounts, and if i have sound activated on both will regularly completely lose all sound for periods of combat with weapon the odd sound cutting through the silence occasionally. zooming out has little effect.the other day, i lost sound in one of my clients completely for several hours. literally nothing came through, combat, station sounds, nothing. i tried disabling and re-enabling sounds through the settings to no avail. only logging and restarting eve fixed it.for reference, i have had these problems on both my audigy 2 as well as the realtek built onto my p5b."
1/11/2010,"i have already made my view on this clear. pos's are the most used isk sink in the game, bar none. they are staging area's, protection ratting and mining pos's, logistics pos's for cyno's cyno gens, jammers, jump bridges, t1 production, t2 reactions, t2 production, t3 reactions and production, base of operations, research labs, super capital construction yards. they are more widely used and effect more people then any other one item in the game, as without them, there would be no t2, no t3,no supercapitals, longer lines for research then we have already.needless to say they are used a lot, and have a lot of uses, to remove them as an isk sink would be removing what i view as the largest isk sink this game has. however, if we must allow them to be constructed, instead of seeding bpo's seed max run bpc's, say 5 per bpc, at the price of the tower itself. so a large tower bpc would cost 350 mil x 5 or 1.75 billion, and then the players themselves could play the value game with them, and compete on the market to sell the towers for bpc cost + minerals + profit. this would make towers cost more in the end, but i can live with that."
1/11/2010,"not supported. song li, you provide no information as to the actual implimentation of your suggestion. all well and good for industialists to get new things to build and markets to explore, but the ramifications of such across the board (unless dealt with carefully) could ruin the game for many players.how do you purpose ccp deal with seeding the new bpos? how will the markets initially be affected? what are the negative effects that will be experienced?"
1/11/2010,"massive fail by csm members song li and z0d in that they do not even know what an isk sink is.removing pos and associated fuel and modules from being an isk sink will be a bad thing for obvious reasons. i like the ""well if you compensate for it, it is ok"" posts. the only realistic way to compensate for this is to put an npc-sold element into every manufacturing job so that the isk sink is spread out over all items instead of in just a few items.while the above method is how other mmorpgs do it and has some merit as you could easily crank up/down the isk sink as needed, it would take quite a bit of work. i don't see a pressing reason for a few new production opportunities when you already have thousands. also, it makes rp sense that amarr control towers are sold by...the amarr.lack of understanding of very basic eve mechanics by csm members and wanting something without reason = no support whatsoever."
1/11/2010,"supported, but only for blueprint copies.give them away in lp stores, for lots of lp and isk."
1/11/2010,"while i do like as many products as possible to be produced by players, i am an even bigger fan in variation to how these products have to be produced.in regard of pos consumables and other trade goods, i am looking towards planetary interaction and seriously hoping that it will make an opportunity to produce those kind of items.in regard to pos towers and buildings, perhaps they too can be manufactured in their own special way with their own special restrictions, instead of just slapping some common minerals and a blueprint together in a public manufacturing slot at a npc station."
1/11/2010,"that's basically a good idea, i like it. but we really dont need yet another reason for people to do missions. at the very least, the tower bpcs should be low on lp and expensive on tags and isk."
1/11/2010,"as i see there was a sisi testing last week, did you get any relevant info from that? we would like to have at least some update on this situation."
1/11/2010,being blown up before you have a chance to see your ship explode is pretty heartbreaking.

1/11/2010,supporting the original idea and the auto repeat option should be an option too
1/11/2010,"well i'll support the idea - and not just because it's my own idea. the purpose of this thread is to have people speak up on a single fairly defined issue: should plexing/occupancy have more value than it currently does? a few of the fw threads have more than one thing they are trying to propose or are so vague like ""fix fw"" - whatever that might mean - that i'm not sure what people are acually supporting. to my mind this is the most important question that needs to be answered. because if it is answered in the negative, then most fw pilots wont really care about all the other issues surrounding plexing - as they will continue to play as if the plexes/occupancy mechanic doesn't exist."
1/11/2010,not supported. factional warfare is irretrievable. the only solution is to shut down fw permanently.
1/11/2010,"yeah, this sounds rather silly. i'm not sure what the solution is, but it sounds like one is needed."
1/11/2010,it should not even be possible to wardec a fellow militia corp.
1/11/2010,"hence why i love self destruct.carbear tears are like beer and burgers, yea its good but nothing truly special. i can get those easy just gank the miners. merc/griefer tears are like fine wine aged for hundreds of years served with a perfact cut of rare texas beef. self destructing to deny a km is one of the few ways to extract them."
1/11/2010,bring a ship scanner and then type up the killmail. it's what kool kidz do.
1/11/2010,"wouldn't it suffice that you get aself-destruct-mail,rather than a kill-mail?i mean, the ""game"" knows wether a ship is self destructed or ""killed"", and of course if it self destructs while under fire it ""becomes"" aself-destruct induced by enemy fire, thus allowing for that new special kind of ""killmail"",you don't get the credit for the kill, but you were involved in the ship's destruction."
1/11/2010,"for a corp member to be able to do a manufacturing job they are currently required to have ""factory manager"" role.this gives them permission to cancel all corp jobs.a corp should be able to setup so that members can start jobs as corp production without also having the ability to delete months of work.seems ""rent factory slot"" does nothing in the post-factory-renting setup."
1/11/2010,"yes, for sure. there should be ""factory user"" and ""factory manager"" roles(with research folded in or split off, on't care too much), with the former only able to see/cancel their own jobs."
1/11/2010,this should be an early focus for ccp in a complete rework of corporate roles.
1/11/2010,"i've played the game for around 2 1/2 years not, but recently started watching this forums. in the time i've been playing insurance for t2 ships has always been based off of t1 chassis cost even though they cost upwards of 10 times as much. could we adjust this payout to atleast pay something worth buying it for? i realize t2 is always in flux cost wise, but even a multiplier on the base cost for a more realistic reimbursment would be a step in the right direction. any thoguhts on the matter, or did this topic sail aong time ago?"
1/11/2010,dev's have clarified that t2 insurance payouts are where they want them to be.
1/11/2010,not to mention that the entire insurance mechanic needs a complete overhaul. halfway measures will only make the problem worse.
1/11/2010,"everytime someone asks for t2 insurance, (and that happens a lot) its clear they have no clue right from the start.insurance is determined by base cost, not market price. write that down 100 times nao"
1/11/2010,"he knows - hence the comment in the op about wanting it to be a multiplier on the base price. not nearly the best solution, but the problem isn't that he is unaware of the mechanics."
1/11/2010,"seriously? learn to read. also base price us determined by marker on both t1 and t2. they are pretty static for t1 within reason, but t2 is well off base to the point no one bothers insuring them. overhaul the whole thing if you like, but y insure a corvette when its payout is that of a chevette?"
1/11/2010,insurance in eve should be abolished all together.
1/11/2010,the lack of adequate insurance coverage is the premium you pay for flying tech 2. you pay an extra premium in terms of your time by flying (and dying in) a tech 3 ship.
1/11/2010,"not only would this be extremely awesome, it would also make it easier to operate in stations without systems.especially allowing 0.0 areas to not be dependent on empire trade routes makes this seem like an excellent idea to me.only problem would be, if these pos's would completely overtake the role of a station - a station is a large investment (well, it cost a lost of isk), and seeing them exchanged by pos's would probably make some people sad."
1/11/2010,"when i think back over the time since dreads came into the game, i've been in a number of fights where there were a large number of dreads on the field. they almost always sucked. hours of camping followed by a slide show where you're reduced to looking at killboards to try to figure out how the fight's going, and where the side with the best lag-fu (not necessarily the best skill or tactics) wins.with a system like this, major engagements would still happen to take/save stations and friendly/hostile poses in the contested system, because having those or depriving the other side of them would be tactically important. they'd still matter, a lot, in the overall outcome of the battle. they just wouldn't be the only thing that mattered.i think that mechanics can be concieved to end the unplayable lag-fest that sov warfare has been for a long time. it just takes getting outside the ""biggest blob wins"" mentality and getting a little more creative."
1/11/2010,"sorry to say this but: you will never be able to stop blobs ;) thats what 0.0 warfare in eve is about. bring more than your enemy, or bring at least as much people which are better than your enemy(skill-/experiencewise)"
1/11/2010,"nah, let them pay. if you are that worried about increased medical cost, there is already (as you pointed out) a built in mechanic to handle that situation, just put training on hold. you can always put the training into an alt at the same accout. having two 50mill chars instead of one 100mill might prove to be more effective for you then in the long run."
1/11/2010,"um.what? if you're finding the cost of your clone to be too much i suggest one of two things is happening:1) you're ****ing people off and getting podded a lot or2) you fail at making any kind of reasonable income.until you get past the sigma level (92.5 million skillpoints, 20 million isk) even a relatively young character (approx 2 - 3 months old) can make the cost of a clone inside a couple of hours of game play. do you really lose your clone more than once every couple of hours?not supported."
1/11/2010,"i can make back the cost of a clone in about an hour ratting, but flying an interdictor i can lose them at about that rate in a fleet fight. i don't have the time to sit down and rat for the amount of time it takes me to earn back the cost of the interdictor and 20mil per clone...the argument about training up an alt makes sense from the current financial point of view, but i think that is showing a problem with the current situation. training an alt to do something completely different from one's main is one thing, but training an alt to fly the same ships as one's main, simply to avoid the cost of clones seems like a waste of training time."
1/11/2010,"uhh...this isn't a problem. rat more, do less pvp if your so concerned, build up some income."
1/11/2010,"supported , there is no reason to fly smaller ships as the pod cost so much compared to the hull. and those small ships are blown up easily then you get podded for whatever reasons."
1/11/2010,and the fitting often times costs so much compared to the hull too! it's almost as if the hull isn't the most important figure when determining costs of pvp.
1/11/2010,"if these numbers are correct, i can't be bothered to check, then op's argument is pvp costs too much hence ccp needs to make it cheaper so he can pvp...no.let's use that number 92million sp, if you can't figure a way to make the costs of your clones by the time you have played eve for 4 years(give or take) with that many sp just sell your character and move on. if you bought a character and the problem remains you need to do some eve research in to how to make isk. if you don't have that sp you should still be able to make the costs of your clones as they won't cost 20mill a pop. finally i'd like to add your corporation/alliance is failing you as they should be helping you get rich if they aren't and you are playing like a sod that dies for them, i can't help you, ccp can't help you, noone can."
1/11/2010,"this, basically. also, even the cost of a 90m sp clone is heavily outweighed by even a pair of +4s and a couple of skill hardwirings.if you're going to argue that you only fly cheap t1 ships and that the clone is expensive in comparison... well what do you need all those sp for then?"
1/11/2010,"i actually got caught by a smart bombing disco raven on a gate on my way back from jita a few days ago and podded. i lost a total of a half billion in isk, not counting the ship itself (yes, i had some expensive implants - sue me). my clone, on the other hand, cost me about 3 million iskguess which expense i was not particularly worried about?(and before you even ask, no i was not autopiloting. i did a wtz, and got caught while he was ganking something else. unless he really wanted the 8 sisters core probes in my cheetah's cargo hold)"
1/11/2010,"from what i understand, eve needs all the isk-sinks it can get. while medical clones probably have an incredibly tiny isk-sink value, they still can be considered one.not supported.greygal"
1/11/2010,the op must be losing his mind.no offense but clones are cheap in comparison to implants and the ship overall.not supporting off-the-wall idea.
1/11/2010,yes please
1/11/2010,both of my thumbs for hersch!
1/11/2010,"being a former tower refueler, i support the general idea.however, i would rather see the mail be generated with the ammount of fuel left in the tower and the ammount of up-time left be each ammount of fuel. instead of telling me how much lozone is left, i'd also like to know how much time that ammount of lozone will last, rather than having to number crunch, alt-tab to run it in mypos, or find out when i physically arrive at the pos."
1/11/2010,i have no clue why it doesn't work that way yet
1/11/2010,"to paraphrase in simpler terms, for pos fuel maintenance, i'm interested in :1) how much fuel is remaining and how do you get this info.quantify the ""fuel left"" in either day/hours left or absolute percentage (based on 30days max fuel). simpler for players to read and absorb. next bit is getting that information, and i agree it should be available at one glance in the corp assets window, although preferably it gets its own dedicated window tab. i'm assuming security measures will be in place that limits the information to authorised personnel only.2) how much fuel is needed and what sort.biggest pain in the ass for any refueler is calculating the amount needed for a full tank. i want to be able to query the pos in question and ask it to tell me what it needs for a full tank. this can also be expanded to let the refueler to be able to manually specify a certain the number of days of operations and let the pos spit the breakdown on what it needs.3) frequency of warning mails and to whom.would prefer 48hr, 24hr, 12hr, 6hr and final 1hr notifications - directed to personnel as above. just a simple mail with info on the pos's exact location. displaying the amount fuel left is unecessary processing as notification title says it all. i just need to know which pos.there ya go"
1/11/2010,"perhaps i wasn't clear - i intended this to be how it worked. i want the fuelmails to stop being just a list of quantities, and to look like the fuel screen on the pos management window. it should have a list of fuels, quantities available, consumption rates, and time remaining, and be sorted by time remaining(preferably with stront either separated out or completely omitted, to avoid confusion). 1) i prefer days/hours, not least because it's physically impossible to fit 30 days of fuel into most towers. if you're going to do a percentage, do it as a percentage of m3 used, and put that beside the days remaining stat. and corp -> assets -> in space is already a dedicated window for pos structures, so i wouldn't mind it being used for this purpose. of course, it'll work much better if structures can be attached to their towers in that window to reduce clutter, but that's one case where i don't think a specialized window is needed. 2) that would be a very handy utility, yes. that said, i'm trying to avoid feature creep here - i'm trying to get a fast fix to one of the most annoying bits of pos management. an omnibus solution is too big to happen as fast, and i'd rather not make the perfect the enemy of the good here. a full fix of pos mechanics is needed, but that doesn't seem to be happening any time soon, whereas i think that this could. faster deployment of this would be better than making sure it has every nifty little utility attached. besides, add in consumption rates to the api data, and it'll get solved third-party - ccp doesn't need to do it. 3) i'm trying to reduce spam. 24h is the notification we get now, and from there you can look at your low-fuel list to see which towers still need help, and 6h is the ""nobody's gotten to it yet, get on it dummy!"" warning. that said, compromise may be possible. i'd be fine with the ceo having the option of half a dozen checkboxes for when fuelmails go out - 48/36/24/12/6/1 hours before, say. it's not as important as the rest of the proposal, but it'd be kind of nifty."

1/12/2010,epic fail at equivocatingthere is a big difference between getting shot down by concord and getting shot down by a player.stop blurring the lines to cover up your pirating/greifing e-peen and start engaging brain before reasoning/arguing.at least the argument for slowing concord down is rational.. yours is just flat off the wall and dripping with emo.
1/12/2010,"it takes 5 destroyers to take down an untanked hulk. total cost of fitting: probably ~5 m. on average, a t2 fit mining min/max hulk will drop much more than that in loot.gankers should htfu. op's suggestion makes sense -- all you have to do is pick your targets better, and you can still make a profit from suicide ganking hulks. just not quite such a big one."
1/12/2010,"you are right, those were mostly bs arguments just to point out the idiotic nature of the proposal. insurance for crime is just as illogical as insurance for any ship of war.look. i can respect someone that says 'remove all insurance'.price of t1 ships will drop, artificial mineral floor goes away, insurance fraud goes away, hisec miner and mission runner income will crash. all good things. of course, then we'd have to deal with miners complaining about how they only make 1m isk/hr and t2 stuff takes longer to buy.but people calling for removing insurance for gankers are simply trying to nerf suicide ganking. if insurance is removed, there needs to be other incentives for gankers provided. a) perhaps allowing pirates to bribe concord to raise their security status with isk. b) perhaps, making it possible to escape concord. (make it a risk, instead of just a cost.)i'll clue you in: suicide ganking is part of the solution, not part of the problem.1. suicide ganking is easy because ships are cheap.2. ships are cheap because eve's economy is flooded in minerals.3. minerals are produced by miners and mission runners.problem: too many miners and mission runners producing too many resources with no risk. violence against the resource producers will decrease supply and increase mineral prices. further, miners who take precautions (tank, stay at the keyboard watching for hostiles) will survive much more frequently than their afk, macroing competitors - and will benefit from higher mineral prices.how do you promote violence against hisec resource producers? wardecs simply don't work, as all miners and haulers will drop corp. that leaves suicide ganking - and only suicide ganking as a tool for combating rampant hi-sec overproduction.also,4. demand is low. no 'great' wars going on.5. pvp, ganking and selfdestruction ""fraud"" are all sources of demand. however, 'fake' self-destructing fraud demand is not desirable.6. remove ganking from the equation, you further encourage more insurance fraud, which is already painfully common.tldr:suicide ganking is commmon because minerals are cheap.making life harder on mrs and miners -drives up mineral prices by reducing supply.encouraging suicide ganking - drives up mineral prices by increasing demand.drive up mineral prices, and ganking becomes more expensive (and less common.) insurance fraud goes away too. a big nullsec war would help too, but we can't force alliances to duke it out (especially with the screwed up lag situation.)"
1/12/2010,guess again.suicide ganking is easy because you get back the amount of isk spent for your ship (minus mods if you go all tech 2) via insurance payouts.lose insurance... now its not cheaper anymore.no one said you couldn't suicide gank..... just means it has to take a larger dent to your precious wallet.
1/12/2010,/support as usual with this topicconcord paying me for a ship that they blew up is about as illogical as it can get.
1/12/2010,"concord doesn't pay for insurance. maybe you should actually try insurance and reading.if you make it so that it is never reasonable to suicide gank you might as well take out the ability altogether. if you take out insurance from concorded ships, you take out a lot of the possible targets, including anything larger than a bc and most transport ships. fleets of destroyers/cruisers can still take out untanked t1 hauler targets but where does it state that suicide ganking must be a group activity or that you shouldn't be able to suicide large targets?this is a hulkageddon whine. wah, wah your ship got blown up. this is intended. you are not supposed to be safe in empire or anywhere in space, yes even high security space. suicide ganking has been the most nerfed mechanic in the game. it is fine to kill expensive, dumbly fit targets who are afk or not paying attention. this is intended. perhpas you need to htfu."
1/12/2010,is space ever safe? ...no
1/12/2010,"couple posts ago you were talking like you were smart or something. engage your brain, you said, or something like that? take your own advice, please. try to see the bigger picture, quit focusing on the individual ganker.i stated that suicide ganking helps solve the current problem with eve's economy. (too much mineral supply, not enough demand, causing low mineral values and insurance fraud + inflation)removing insurance for suicide gankers would only reduce ganking, when in reality, we need more of it. (yes, obviously you could 'still do it' at a loss, but in reality, far less people would opt to.) in absence of a major nulsec war driving up demand - less ganking makes the mineral oversupply problem even worse, which leads to more insurance fraud and the isk inflation that goes with it. don't you notice all the people self-destructing ships outside manufacturing centers? doesn't this suggest a fundamental problem to you? that a ship, made from t1 minerals, is worth more dead than alive?now, suicide ganking doesn't have to be the only solution. anything that allows people to attack and slow down rampant resource production (miners and mission runners) would work. unfortunately, wardecs are broken, and suicide ganking is the only way to achieve that end in hi-sec, currently.and, like i said - if mineral prices were higher it solves all problems: ships are more expensive, carebears make more isk, insurance fraud goes away, and ganking also would become more expensive. cause and effect."
1/12/2010,what's next? telling me that concord should be removed because they assist in the rising of inflation?all i see here are pirates/gankers throwing a fit over the increasing potential of insurance getting shut off.keep crying... i'll keep collecting your tears.
1/12/2010,"and why is this necessary?suicide ganking affects afkers, macroers, multi-boxers more than human, alert, single-client players.are you saying the macroers and afkers need a boost? are alert miners who know how to align, watch local and tank their ships in need of nerfing? is mining veld in hi-sec not quite boring and predictable enough for you?in short: given that suicide ganking is a perfectly legitimate technique, explicitly recognised as such by ccp, what evidence do you have that suicide ganking ""needs"" to be nerfed?"
1/12/2010,"wait....i'm crying because...i'm pointing out your inability to comprehend economics or english?as it stands right now, i'm quite happy with the current situation, meaning i have no reason to cry. why?i don't seriously think ccp is going to change insurance, for the same reasons i've just expressed. increased suicide ganking is merely a natural outgrowth of 'too many minerals'. they can't all be self-destructed, though i'm guessing thats what you would prefer. because that is exactly what nerfing suicide ganking would lead to.i suppose the real question is:why do you want more insurance fraud? are you profiting from it somehow? don't you think its a bit stupid that thousands upon thousands of battleships are self destructed every day outside stations? yet, you want to see more of it?my goal is to increase mineral prices. yeah, i could fly around in low sec and pop cheaply fit, insured cruisers and bcs. but really, that doesn't accomplish much, especially considering those targets flying t1 become wealthier after i pop them.the best way to increase mineral prices (aside from self destructing battleships all day), is to attack the hulks and mission runners that are creating all those minerals."
1/12/2010,bump
1/12/2010,"good point, jim. i'm getting sick of bringing my caldari ships to gangs and having to armour tank them just because every other ship in the gang is running remote armour reps. but that is an issue for another time.by the way, you can freely ignore stil; he's a troll and a moron. note that he jumped on your point that caldari have the lowest armour, completely ignoring the fact that you said ""that's fine"" and were not calling for a caldari armour buff. just ignore him; he's an imbalance denialist.actually, i'd say that you're sounding pretty stupid yourself. shield tankers have less low slots than armour tankers, so any modules put there have to be balanced against damage mods. a dcu on an armour tank is a tanking mod in a tanking slot; no problem there. on a shield tanker, it's an irregularity. a caracal for example has only 2 low slots; it's ridiculous to try and fit a damage control there. and of course, never mind how hard it is to fit fitting mods like rcus (usually a requirements if you want to fit hams or torpedoes). and before you complain that armour tankers have to choose between tank and damage, shield tankers have to choose between tank and tackle/point/ewar, so you can't really plead that case.i have logic, your argument is invalid!"
1/12/2010,"not that this is in anyway relevant to an argument about caldari damage bonuses, but your argument is infact not logical for the reason that a shield tanker fitting armour tank mods need shooting in the head. *****ing over dc-caracals to try and force a point with ""logic"" doesnt do much for a valid argument.i could just as well whine about not being able to effectively use invul. fields on a typhoon or slasher tbqh. its got about the same amount of relevance.arguments about remote rep, and arguments about lolfit caracals are utterly irrelevant, and therefor illogical, and therefor your argument is invalid!see, i can use capslock too"
1/12/2010,"arcane azmadi pls ignore vheri kai'or too , he is the same as stil h. ."
1/12/2010,maybe they should just get rid of remote armor and remote shield reps and just make 1 module that repairs both.. if you have 100% armor it starts to repair shields.. ok sure its not realistic but it would get caldari viable in rr and not the outcast.. or maybe a remote repair module that is scripted?
1/12/2010,"yes god forbid we try and stay on topic here and what do you mean the same? as in i can stay on topic? or you calling me/us a troll? if so the report button is right there man^and to jim: a generic remote rep module wouldnt work from an rp standpoint, and would probably be overpowered if it repped at rates comparable to what the individual reppers manage now. in addition to this you have the fact that shields and armour actually work quite differently in terms of their utility in a pvp setting, and it would take a lot of recoding to appropriatly modify the various carriers and logi ships (a changed bonus to the nidhoggur at least, and all logi ships would have to be changed and rebalanced...) so it isnt really viable.anyway...what was the topic again?"
1/12/2010,"yeah because shield vs armor tanking is relevant to this topic.ive a new idea lower base armor kinetic resist by 20% ,this would fix both the kinetic only issue and armor tanking being superior."
1/12/2010,"ok, so you want to nerf armour tanking to give a boost to a ship bonus for which there is no problem, the idea of which is in turn a misdirected attempt to buff caldari ships which for pg, cpu and slot layout (and rocket) reasons need buffing? awesome idea.at any rate; last i checked a shield tank can tolerate far more damage than any armour tank for shorter legnths of time at capital level, is superior for small support ships such as inty's, cruisers and some hacs, and is able to tank massive amounts of dps, often indefinitely with any pve fit....so how is shield tanking inferior? either ative or otherwise its positives balance well against its negatives, and on the whole balance well against armour tanking. just because standard sr rrbs rely on armour as the basis of fleet sustainability doesnt mean shield tanking is inferior in any way.as an aside, the fact that you consider shield/armour tank differences important should indicate that the original idea of this thread is too poorly thought out to provide an efficient, relatively self contained fix (to a problem, i will re-iterate, that doesnt exist)."
1/12/2010,not supported. kinetic is caldari's racial damage type.
1/12/2010,great! then we can change the rof bonuses for every other race to racial damage bonuses to match their race right?
1/12/2010,yes pls.
1/12/2010,"racial damage has not been implemented for over 5 years for the other races to any great extent.amarr ( em race ) , gets bonus to thermal damage output from rof and dpl bonuses, also has a small range of drone boats that get rainbow damage drone bonuses.there are no em racial bonuses applied to amarr hulls apart from 1 ship iirc.gallente ( thermal race ) , get bonus to kinetic damage output from rof and dpl bonuses, also has a range of heavily rainbow damage bonused drone boats.there are only 2 gallente ships that get racial bonuses.mini ( explosive race ) , get rainbow damage bonuses to there main weapons. funnily allways doing a little kinetic instead of always doing a little explosive.only 1 mini ship gets a racial bonus.in the op the 1 mini , 1 amarr and 2 gallente boats are included in the list of ships to fix.so you see its only really caldari that have ""racial"" damage bonuses ( 14 ships post dominion iirc ).racial damage bonuses are inherintly weeker than dpl or rof.all were asking for here is equality in bonuses with other races."
1/12/2010,"if i/we are such trolls, why have you all both stopped debating the topic. the fact that you both have resorted to calling us trolls and morons tells me that you have run out of arguments.anyways, as vheri said, the report button is right there, go ahead and click it. then i can report you for trolling, being uncivil, and abusing the report tool. everything i have said i believe to be true, and is a valid argument.i'm not sure what to say to this....if you were paying attention, you wold ""note that"" somebody arguing to support this thread brought up the /off topic/ tanking issue, so you guys can't get mad at us when we debate what you brought up! anyways, it has nothing to do with the op. whining about how caldari has the best shield tanks has nothing to with your missiles or other problems....once again, thanks for calling me a moron. i am perfectly secure about my intelligence level, doesn't bother me one bit.you just said yourself that it's balanced...shield tankers have to mix damage mods and fittings, and one dc, if you insist on using a hull module. shields mix prop/ewar with tank.armor mixes fitting controls, tank, and damage. all fighting for the low slots. all of a sudden your situation doesn't look so bad huh? instead of 2 types of fitting fighting for a single rack, armor tankers have three fighting for one rack. you can't plead your off topic (balanced) case either!naomi, your last like 4 posts have been one liners either insulting me and vheri, or adding no constructive thought to this thread. your accusation of me being a troll is amusing.amarr and gallente have limited drone ships with rainbow damage. gallente 4? amarr 3? something like that?amarr and gallente also get bonused to 2 damage types from guns and can""t stray. caldari being able to stray from your damage bonus (on certain ships) makes up for the sometimes single damage bonus. your weapons are fiiineee. op would not fix caldar"
1/12/2010,"the poster i was replying to was under the illusion that we play a game where all races have racial damage bonuses.which is clearly not the case.you cant dismiss 2 damage types as being racial if were playing a game with racial damage bonuses , which we arnt.not only 2 it should be only 1.no more kin bonuses on blasters for gallente.no more therm bonuses on lasers for amarr.no more bonsues on proj except exp proportions of damage.then all bonuses would be equally poor.gal would be 1/2 dps as would amarr , mini would be shafted.lol even if you nerf gal and amarr to do racial only they would still be better than caldari currently have.yes amarr and gallente cant stray , they dont have to, they get the dps to compensate for not having the ability to aim for resist holes.blasters 30% more dps than projectiles , lasers 10% more dps than projectiles with significantly better range profile.^^ all guns with tracking etc.i dont know about fiiineee , i'd go with substandard to ok across the different platforms.but this post isnt about weaaapppoooonnnsssss ittttsssss abbbbouuuuuutttttt bbbbbbbbbooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnuuuuuuuuusssssssssseeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssssssssss :) :)op is the only fix for caldari that can bring balance across ships , skills , racesand while were on the subject of amarr|gallente non damage switching weapon types.have you ever thought to extrapulate the benifits to amarr|gallente from this fix.?i'll give you a clue, a starting point, check out killboards for kills and loadout and look at the prevelance of eanm|invuln field fits, which leave resist holes only in exp | em.if those em|exp resist holes start getting patched on best loadouts to compensate for there now being 2 races ( mini and caldari ) that do rainbow it means weaker resists for gallente|amarr to shoot at too.ps if i havnt replied to your whole post you know why that is this time right ? :)"
1/12/2010,in all honesty the best solution would be to make missiles do roughly 60% kinetic damage and 40% damage of another type depending on the missile used then give caldari ships a straight up damage bonus (and other applicable ships).. caldari will still do mostly kinetic but there will be some tactical advantage to swapping missiles.
1/12/2010,"dav reiterating the same point over and over does not change the inherent error in the point. the fact of the matter is that this supposed inbalance amongst some of the caldari ships is not the result of the bonuses they have, but a result of other unrelated factors. the drake and cerb both have a kin bonus and they are both excellent ships that can dish out a fair amount of hurt against any ship class (though obviously its better that they fight ships with large sig's).the problems that you suppose changing the kin bonus will fix will not be effected, simply because they are nothing to do with the kin bonus. the other ships with this (supposed) fail bonus all have unrelated problems that having a rainbow damage bonus would not fix.on the other hand, can someone give a little detail on jim's idea of split damage missiles? it seems to me that no matter the payload a high speed package delivery system would do some kinetic damage by its very nature, so this doesnt sound bad from an rp standpoint at least (i with-hold judgement on the balance of it till its explained in more detail)"
1/12/2010,"i would be all for making gallente shoot only thermal and getting bonused to it, and amarr shooting only em, and getting bonused to it, and minmatar shooting only explosive, and getting bonused to it. but then what benefit would we get? caldari would get bonused to only their racial weapon, but amarr and gallente can't switch damage types! can't use the fact that gallente and amarr can do more damage (in some but definitely not all cases) as damage is related to range. blasters short range so more damage, balanced. caldari would decisively overpower ther other races. also there would be no diversity.yes i know now i'm arguing against more than 1 person and at least you don't go screaming troll and moron to all of my posts i like debating with you more. your arguments also make more sense.blasters do more damage, but have far inferior range. they need another perk because they're still at a disadvantage not being able to pick damage types like caldari, even if we only get bonused to thermal. you're trying to argue that blasters get damage instead of being able to pick the damage type, when i feel that that relationship is actually blasters get damage because the range utterly sucks. and sorry about kinda making the argument about weapons, i just think that since we're talking about the bonus for the weapons, it's necessary to compare weapon systems before assuming caldari is getting shafted by their bonus."
1/12/2010,"[overview]: tech 3 ships are great!they might not have the specialized bonuses like their t2 recon counterparts, but they make up for it with better tank and in some cases better dps. however their main advantage and their uniqueness, as ccp intended when designing this new ship was it's ability to be modular.t3's main feature is that you can change what your ship does, and in effect, how your ship looks, by swapping it's subsystems. you can change the bonuses it gets, the number of turrets/launchers, the number of high/med/low slots, even give it special bonuses like the ability to warp cloaked, or the ability to defy interdiction bubbles.in theory, a player can have only 1 (one) t3 hull and with multiple subsystems in his possession, swap and fit whatever is needed based on a given situation at hand. in practice, that is only true in normal space. this issue i am posting about is only known to wormhole space (wspace) ""colonists"" (*)in wspace, players will have to either choose to stay with only 1 version of their t3 ship, or choose to get an additional t3 ship for a different role, or find an exit to normal space, somehow haul their subsystem with their t3 ship in a station, refit and come back again.[issue]: inside wspace, you are not allowed to: - assemble your t3 ship - change any subsystem of an already assembled t3 ship.[proposal]: option 1: - allow players to change subsystems of their t3 ships inside wspace once they have been assembled in a normal space station. - existing structures like the ship maintenance array can be used to change a ship's fitting, so why not it's subsystems as well? - i believe it's a sensible compromise and a solution that would be well received by the whole community of wspace colonists. option 2: - enable the assembly and fitting/swapping of t3 subsystems in a pos module. - either at an existing structure like the subsystem assembly array already used to create t3 hulls and subsystems or.. - or by introducing a new pos module for t3 ship assembly and swapping of subsystems.[pros]: - will make people in wspace use their tech 3 ships as designed - will make lots of people living in wspace happier [cons]: - none that i am aware of-----i will be updating this thread with feedback from any comments.(*) ccp has time and again stated that they don't intent to support full-scale colonization of wspace. the non existence of moon minerals, ice products etc are some of the ways of ensuring that players will have to try hard to setup a base in wspace. i am all up for it - not making wpsace too easy to colonize, however this proposal is about fixing what seems to me unfair. the players that live in wspace and make t3 ships a reality for players in new eden are the ones not able to use the t3 ship in it's intended design.qp"
1/12/2010,i totally agree with you.just let us swap subsystems like modules at a pos.
1/12/2010,"ditto...this is a no-brainer. they should fix the fitting management tool while they are at it as well, so you can use the quick fit feature at a pos/sma."
1/12/2010,"i would very much support option 2 as it is the better of the two options. pos should be more like npc stations in how they function imo. the second option allows for the greatest flexability of acheiving ship assembly, refit and making a pos into more of a legitimate station.pos are expensive and require a great deal of upkeep especially in wspace, give them more legitimacy i say!?up"
1/12/2010,"i believe that what quivering palm suggest is reasonable. as did he, i myself couldn't find any cons on what he suggested. i am totaly supporting this one."
1/12/2010,totally have felt the pain of that as a permanent w-space denizen.1000% supported!
1/12/2010,"well, as t3 are intended to be flexible, let them be so."
1/12/2010,completely supported.
1/12/2010,this feels like a dumb technical issue standing in the way of intended design. i'd like to see it fixed.

1/12/2010,"i don't know if anyone has pointed this out already (i'm not reading 3 pages of this stuff to find out) but because your shield status is reset everytime your gang jumps from one system to another, you will almost never have time to passively recharge the missing shield before you either fly into combat, or have to jump again (unless you're running a gate camp).honestly, the people opposed to this proposal aren't concerned with ""balance"". this isn't a major threat to game balance between shield and armour tankers, it's just a matter of consistancy and ironing out an issue that annoys quite a few people. the people who are arguing so fervently against it are just people who don't like shields and don't want to see them get any stronger than they are.go on and deny it. i dare you."
1/12/2010,"the exact same behavior is observed when you change ships from your pos's ship maintenance array.when ship that has passive shield tank will be boarded it will start from around 80% shields or as low as 25% shields (assuming modules like large shield extenders are used).this gives passive shield tanked ships considerably less buffer tank than what should be expected compared to armor tanked ships. in effect, any passive shield tanked ship has a distinctive disadvantage if you choose to use it in defending your pos from attacks or if you want to board one and go into a fight right away.i fully support this!"

1/12/2010,"lowsec missions? ok, that's fine. that's fairly normal. but 10+ jumps? come on, that's just plain stupidity. people who run regular missions often do so because of time limitations, and the fact that missions are click to play. these new missions only serve to ruin that./supported"
1/12/2010,"definitely supported. i do not care to be the developers' lab rat. let them test this atrociously bad idea on themselves or on volunteers. replace ""atrociously bad"", in the previous sentence, with any of the following: ill-conceived, insane, poorly designed, and/or malicious. what a bloody mess these troop build up missions are. not only are they ""experimental"", but they were hastily conceived and tacked onto dominion at the last moment. after fighting the gate campers, then we have to somehow refit for pve and fight npcs that are two level highers than what the mission is supposed to be.and why gallente? look at how few cosmos missions we have compared to all the other empire factions and the answer becomes instantly obvious. gallente is like the unwanted step-child shoved into an attic. my friend the programmer says that gallente was also selected because there are fewer of us to have to deal with when the complaints rolled in."
1/12/2010,"i will suport or not support this topick only when i try one of them myself. however, anything above 3 jumps into low-sec is excessive, and the current amount of jumps is silly.if the mission is in low-sec, it should either be build in such a way that you can do it with a smaller ship, without risking a very expensive battleship, or that it pays much more money or/and lp, i am talking about several times. i would prefer them to be optional personally. and i would like them to be doable in a good bc.current situation does not sound like it is right. however i am all for optional low-sec missions that offer more pay."
1/12/2010,"definitely supported.these missions are a ridiculous idea that should never have got past the test server phase in the state they are.if they insist on keeping these, then at least offer 2 storyline missions to people - one of these (with improved rewards) and a standard one (materials for war, hauling 40k, encounter near the agents system).then people could choose either a risky better reward fw type one, or do the standard lower paying one."
1/12/2010,s'way the sad thing is that these were not even tested on the test server. in the dev blog words they were so excited by these missions that they could not wait to inflict them on gallente pilots.the fact they they were excited and could not see the consequences of using storyline missions to force fw pvp on pve'ers who were grinding faction shows how truly moronic the atlanta based eve storyline board are. just shows they must be hiring some complete georgia bubba's for their atlanta team.

1/12/2010,"there will be no fix, ever. ccp have made this very clear. the best we can hope for is that all the systems return to their original owners, ccp permanently disables the militias and that they provide some sort of reimbursement for the wasted time."
1/12/2010,"qft;as with the old cosmos, facwar was released, realized to be buggy beyond sanity, and ccp just threw up their hands and gave up. it's unlikely they'll ever bother to examine it again, just like they did with cosmos other than fix the insane farming issues.and, well, they've done their farming fix somewhat, so... that's that.cosmos is now a nonissue and languishes as a decent concept with completely abandoned followthrough.alas, such is ccp. all we can do is expect it to get far, far worse with d514."

1/12/2010,"despite ccp's amazing efforts with unholy rage, people are still getting their accounts hacked. chribba made a proposal more than a year ago (thread | wiki), and the proposal saw overwhelming support by the csm at that time (was that the first csm ever?). unfortunately, the wiki and thread provide no evidence that any action was taken at all, nor evidence that the issue was discussed with ccp. i realize that we are encouraged not to re-raise old items, but this is too important for the csm to ignore.my proposal is simple, the csm needs to discuss the possibility of the following services being provided by ccp to their customers:1) a hardware based authenticator, which would ideally be very similar to the successful blizzard authenticator. -this would make it nigh impossible for any account using this authentication method to be hacked2) ability to restrict account access to ip addresses,geographic locations, or isps (via whois)-this would force hackers to find a proxy with an ip address which satisfies the accounts requirements. you might be able to make this work in tandem with whois to restrict log ins to a specific internet service provider. a hacker would thus likely be unable to access an account using his own ip address, or a random proxy. he would have to find an appropriate proxy (which, depending on how this is implemented, might not exist) which would fool this authentication method.3) ability to see account access information - both successful and failed access attempts. show relevant data, such as time of attempted access and ip address where the access request came from.- this would allow account users to know if someone has been accessing their account. this would allow ccp's customers to know if a hacker has been ""peeking"" at their account to see if it is ripe for harvesting. while this would be of little use for incidents where a hacker empties the wallet as soon as he access the account, it is still useful to be made available to the customers.4) increased transparency and explanation when temp banning an account for investigation. currently, when someone gets banned, they are provided with relatively little information about why they got banned. they then file petitions (which further impedes customer support), and come to the forums trying to contact ccp (which provides more work for moderators). players have many questions that they want answered when they suddenly find their account banned. ccp should provide customers with the following information: -why is my account being investigated?-why does my account need to be banned when being investigated?-has it been confirmed that my account has been compromised?-how is it possible that my account has been compromised?ccp should also provide some articles which provide important information with regards to account security (the eve wiki would make a wonderful repository for said articles), how players can protect themselves, describing the various methods that hackers gain access to accounts (please also make users aware that they can be infected by malicious advertisements which exploit vulnerabilities in web browsers to install keyloggers without the user knowing).unholy rage was a wonderful way to suppress rmt. but ccp needs to press the advantage. by making it harder for rmters to hack accounts, ccp could eliminate rmt, reduce gm/isd workload (think of the cost savings!), reduce petition queues, give customers piece of mind, and improve customer satisfaction in general.account security can't just be the sole responsibility of the user. many users are not tech saavy, and need assistance to help protect their account. ccp should provide this."
1/12/2010,"ccp should not be responsible for the stupidity of its subscribers.how not to get hacked:1. don't use an easy password2. don't download/install software if you are not sure of what it is or where it came fromblizzard is able to come up with an authenticator because it pulls in 80 gajillion usd a month.i, for one, want my $45/month going towards ccp salaries, and game development.. not on toys for morons that don't know how the internet works."
1/12/2010,"the toy in question is profitable, and it provides a service some consider useful. i see no reason to oppose it just because it's a cover for people with bad security practices - i know a lot of people who are willing to spend a lot more than $20 on a dongle key to allow themselves to get away with being lazy. i have no objection to lowering the amount of stupid busywork in the world(memorizing/changing complex passwords, in this case)."
1/12/2010,"i like the idea of an authenticator, i am an ex wow player and did buy the authenticator. i would be willing to buy an authenticator for eve. don't make it required, but as an optional device. i also use an authenticator for work to sign into our vpn so i can work from the road. i see the major positive bonuses for this.the down side is if it breaks, how would you suggest a support system to help those who have broken or lost their authenticator. my thoughts on this is some system that can contact the account owner via phone/email and provide a code to assist disabling the authenticator."
1/12/2010,deffo support since i would love parts of my original idea as well as new found techniques for improved security.
1/12/2010,"oh god not this again.1) if you want to throw your money away on a useless authenticator then fine, but it will not make it impossible for your account to be stolen if you download harmful software. in reality you are just scared of third hand reports of people getting ""hacked"" and want a magic device instead of using common sense and basic security precautionary measures. again, if you are paranoid to buy an authenticator then you are paranoid enough to not download strange programs or use password1 as your password. 2) i don't think you know how ip addresses work. insanely bad idea.3) i don't think you know what hacking is. hackers don't ""peek"" at your account. i don't see what you can possibly do with the information. ccp on the other hand can do something with the information, not you. you are a user not an administrator, there is a world of difference between the two.4) ya, agree. banned accounts, especially for being stolen or otherwise should be given a very high priority, right below stuck and billing in the petition queue. especially with all the wrongful banning of players going on it is crazy.in conclusion, basic account security is in the realm of the user. you must protect your user/pass and your computer from basic attacks. no amount of work from ccp can stop some genius from sending his user/pass to a nigerian prince who has billions of isk tied up. nor can we save people who visit isk selling sites and go ""gee whiz, the site said to install this thing i guess i'll click ok, dur dur"" etc, etc, etc. we must not compromise the ease of which we log onto eve to protect people who are beyond help.my main problem with these security posts is that the few good ideas are clouded by terrible ones.however, i will support this proposal because if ccp is going to tell us account security is a problem then they should at least do something about it. i don't see a problem with the tin foil hat tax (i mean the authenticator) or basic articles about how to create a strong password and telling users how to spot real obvious account scmas out there."
1/12/2010,"yeah, like eft or evemon... i'm sure there are quite a lot of hacked installers out there, if you don't download them from the original location. and some websites are darn good at disguising they aren't actually the real thing.oh, i'd love to see the option to lock logging in down to a fixed set of ips, with a separate password for the webpage that lets me manage those. i think the op has his ip-addresses about right, if you think he is (and i am) in error, please explain instead of just troll.true, most hackers would just sell all the moment they get in, but you find 'last logged in at 12:43 am from xxx.yyy.zzz.aaa.dsl.telstra.co.za' at a lot of places where you can log in (most forums, horde webmail etc).true. however, providing means of security which go beyond 'something you know' into 'something you have' doesn't have to exclude the less secure user/pass (though you should be able to disable it for your own account as soon as you have an authenticator), hence not making your login on your ultra secure pc slower or more difficult.you are debating an authenticator will make logging in safer (provided it will be possible to make said authenticator mandatory for your account)?"
1/12/2010,"i am actually quite tech saavy, and am quite confident in my account's security. i use an up-to-date antivirus, i use a non-standard web browser so i can avoid most of the exploits out there, i have my computer behind a nat-enabled router so a hacker can't even see my computer unless i am the one initiating contact with them, i am careful about what i download and execute, i do not run my account as an administrator so any trojans that i accidentally executed would not be run with admin privileges. i would not need an authenticator myself.the idea is that some people are not tech saavy, and don't really know how to secure their computers. an authenticator allows those who are paranoid but not tech saavy enough to secure their home computer properly to be protected from account hijackings.sure i do. ip addresses are owned and operated by iana, which delegates certain rangers of ip addresses to various registries. these registries then sell these ip addresses to various users - most of them isps, large corporations or telecommunication companies. these companies can then distribute these ip addresses as they see fit. isps, for example, distribute ip addresses that they have purchased out to their customers so they can access the internet.if you have an ip address, you can determine a certain amount of information about the user. for example, my ip address starts with ""24"". the ip addresses from 24.0.0.0 to 24.255.255.255 have been delegated to arin, so you know that i live in north america. if you do a reverse dns lookup on my ip address, you will find out that my isp is charter communications, and that the dhcp server i use is located in bay city, mi. you now have my general geographic location.my idea is to get ccp to utilize this information, and restrict account access to an ip address which is owned and operated by my isp. this would make it so a hacker in europe would have to find a proxy server on my isp's network to even attempt to access my account.i agree that this is of marginal use to the user. however, this might be useful if you have a family member or friend who figure out your password (probably because you wrote it down somewhere or chose a bad one).i see not all of my ideas here are hair-brained .while i agree that users should be solely responsible for their account's security, i also believe that it would be in ccps best interest to do something on their end to improve account security. after all, they are the ones who want rmt and macros done away with the most."
1/12/2010,"song li, i have to agree with many of the posters here in that we can't be getting rid of isk sinks in the name of a player-driven economy if you don't also reduce or remove a faucet by an equal amount (or maybe a bit more).if they were npc-seeded bpcs and the bpc was a significant portion of their current price then i think that might be a good idea but then you wouldn't be doing nearly as much for the indies since they would be relatively . the manufacturers might like it and i'm sure some nullsec alliances (especially drone space and wormhole people) would love to haul bpcs and minerals out instead of towers but everyone else has to deal with the inflation too.on-topic, we need to get rid of or reduce a faucet to have any significant portion of a pos' cost in player-harvested resources. this simply can't be implemented by itself."

1/12/2010,"there are two parts on this proposal one based on an asumption one not.first of all in massive fleet fights many ( if not most ) of pilots turn off effects , missile and turrets effects in order to reduce lag. thi is where the asumption comes in and it is that the server still send updates on those things to the client thus this being only a measure that helps only the local client and not to reduce server side lag. 1).so proposal number 1 goes:if client has eefects, turrets & missiles disabled the server to stop sending updates on those to the client. 2).proposal number two not based on any asumption:when server-load/network load exceeds a certain treshold the server to automatically stop sending updates on effects ( ie sensor booster ) and missile and turret effects. i have a ferm belif that all players are more intrested to have working modules and a decent controll on the ship rather than being able to see if that ship they are fighting has or not a sensor booster fitted. ( this atleast in massive fights - small scale pvp is diffrent ) also seeing alot of lazors is ofc nice but if that means i cannot deactivate my laser for 10 minutes i happily give that up.devs could crunch some numbers and try to figure the positive impact on those changes , csm to propose that and comunity to agree or disagree.please discuss/vote.tl;dr version: if it would reduce lag would you agree the effects (sensor booster repair effects etc) and guns & missile effects to be cut off from server in massive laggy as hell fights ?"
1/12/2010,the server is very likely not responsible for effects updates... only positional updates.the client is the one that puts the effort into special effects that you outlined.your making a-lot of assumptions as to how/whats involved here... might want to do some research first.
1/12/2010,"the client have to know when to display those effects. it recives those from the server otherwise it wouldnt know when to display those effects.server sends that x is pewpewing into the pos , client displays that x is pew pewing in pos.but if client isnt displaying , and in big fights this makes more lag better just not to send this information anyway.it's a lag-free vs nice graphix vote and i vote for less lag."
1/12/2010,"drake, i beg to differ - how does your client know who is firing at who or who is using what modules? the server needs to tell it. as a lag-reduction measure in fleet fights, removing that information from being sent at all seems like a good way to squeeze a bit more performance out in a big battle. i don't know if it's practical or worthwhile, but it should be investigated."
1/12/2010,either way neither of us know whats involved.. we just assume it to be the case.but yes it needs to be looked into.
1/12/2010,"i would guess the information in question is batched. to try to differentiate between who has what effects on, then create multiple batches of information to send to the groups, based on who has what running, would likely put even more load on the server. if the problem was coming from internet bandwidth, this would be a logical solution. however, as the lag is isolated to a node, it would seem the bottleneck is server side. therefore, adding more processes would likely make things worse, not better (depending on what is the bottleneck)."
1/12/2010,"batching the information, packing it and encrypting it into the protocol used between server and client shurley takes much more processing power than just discarding it in regarding to communication with clients.while bandwidth shouldnt be a bottleneck at first thought anything that reduces it is welcome.and if filtering based on client preference will ahve negative inpact well better just not send info at all in reall laggy situations. shouldnt be hard to implement but that's where the taste of the players come in. want module lag with posibility to see where the other people shoot 15 minutes ago or to be able to activate your guns now.well now(soo tm)"
1/12/2010,"i'm makeing assumptions as well, but they req. you fill out a req. for large fleet fights to reinforce nodes, by y is thete not a automated system in place to proactivly predict this? i mean take the most recent lagfest in y2 i think. thete was 2 large cap fleets. could the system not say well we have a few hundred here and a few hundred there. chances are they are in jump rang and goung to engage, let's reinforce both in prepetatons. if nothing else when the cyno lit up its was a forseeablevbattle. again i'm making emperical observations."
1/12/2010,"i can be mistaken, but put this way it seem the server would not tell you (the player computer) who is firing to you. who is firing to your corpmates. who is not firing at all. who is remote repping a ship.can become real messy in fw battles where you can have neutral third party presents and in any battle where you need to know who is doing what.then there is the not small problem of desinc. with less information sent your pc will update the situation to what the server see with less frequency, increasing the chance of a desinc. about the animation very often it has almost nothing to do with what is really happening serverside as the eve program on your pc (from what some dev said) do a lot of prediction based on previsions informations and check the ""real"" serverside situation at large (speaking in computer operation time, not people perception) intervals."
1/12/2010,"for the parties involved ( eg: weather you are targetting someone or you are beeing shot at ) it will allways display as it should be diffrent code involved. you are reciving damage or you are doing damage, or current target takes damage. it will show up.as far as remote repping yes indeed it will be a problem as it will be a third party to third party effect and would be removed. question is if that information is vital in 500 to 500 fights that would benefit most from this change and in witch lag is a far more important kill-factor than who reps who. after all logi in range should allways be killed ;)"
1/12/2010,"i don't think this is feasible as a csm proposal. first of all we don't know the code, second we don't know what efforts ccp has made and is making under the surface to improve the game."
1/12/2010,"i want to add that this bookmarking idea opens a new pvp frontier, quite simply.if someone is so bold as to provoke and steal from me during a mission, i'm sure they have the guts do duke it out with me, in a more fair environment than the mission pocket space, when the mob is aggroing me.thus i would be able to warp out, refit for pvp, and get back into deadspace while they are still looting, in a matter of a couple of minutes, to start a fair fight.all in all, the possibility of bookmarking mission deadspace would benefit pvp potential, too.it's a win-win solution for several problems."
1/12/2010,"this was a really great troll thread mate, really cute. it looks like you netted a bunch of saps. hell, you even got me...but...we're all onto your clever gag now. it's time to just let this one go - let it die back into page 2 or 3 and not be heard from again. it's just not funny anymore."

1/12/2010,"out of curiosity, i just checked the csm-wiki on this topic. there are three entries so far:submitted 15-06-2008 by serenity steel kill rights should be transferable (csm)this one goes a bit farther then just allowing for a bounty hunter profession, but is right on the path. was supported by all csm-members with one abstainment.submitted 17-08-2008 by dierdra vaal bountyhunting improvements (csm)very much what did propose, probably should have looked for existing csm-entries first. they added the idea to just create bounty contracts on pilots without kill-rights. no results of csm oder csm/ccp discussions provided in that entry, but it looks like this is linked to the next one.winter 08/09 (no date at this info) 2nd csm/ccp meeting minutesit was discussed, generally agreed on and supported by both csm and ccp, but, as i read it, no decision made and the issue died.so former csms liked it, ccp stated they would like to have it, and its just a question of priorities. maybe we can shift priorities a little, or a bit more then a little?"
1/12/2010,"i was playing eve online with mercenary totenkopf my main caracter for missioning. after getting a email letting me know i can play for 5 days for free kind of like incentive to start playing eve online after a year of inactivity. well this may sound like a whining to some people but i am sure this is something that eve is aware of and its churn of people leaving the game. the griefing in this game is off the charts to be more specific its rewarding to those that device a way to use the pvp rules to theyr favor in a ""high security"" area 0.9 motsu. while i was doing mission agains guristas forgot how it work out with all the hardeners to fit and what damage to do i had a nice golem before i left the game and got bored and stop playing. wich left me with barely 50 mill. after i came back spend about 20 mill to refit my golem with all tech 2 stuff. to my surprice i got 5 guys warping to my mission. i reply in local ""you found me? lol"" well they all left and leave me alone. after one guy just warp in i didnt pay attention but he got very close and got taged as hostile i attack with the drones knowing he was stealing my valuables from the mission i was spending my time earning the money in a honest way. surprise surprise he warp out and come back with a ship setup with em and specific to pvp when he knew what mission i was doing and he knows my setup is pve. heven tho i offer him my 30 mill wich is all i got he blows me off letting me know that there is more money maybe if he just blow me off. now i got 60 mill and no ship to do my lvl 4 missions enjoying my 3 months work to get the golem was banish becouse someone was feeling like using the meachanics for someone is not playing pvp is the weaker target he find and exploit that fact to his benefit instead of going to 0.0 and do all the pvp he can do.bottom line game should be fix when is not allow to do pvp in high sec unless both parties concent. i didnt concent to be stealing my loot and i didnt conect him to be in the same mission i was. there is no education system for coming back players how is the new ways they mechanise to grief other people. beutifull game but bad bad pvp gameplay or should i say bad gameplay experience."
1/12/2010,someone unplugged your mic.
1/12/2010,sorry when i hit enter in the tittle it actually created a post without anything in it. but i updated with the original though.
1/12/2010,"hehe, no worries; was just kiddin with ya.in regards to your post though, i've fallen head-first into the same kind of trap before. i lost a raven not too long ago to a really clever trap. however, while i was ****ed about losing the ship, i was more ****ed at myself for falling into it. the guy who did it pulled off a good trick, and i lost the ship and learned a lesson.i know it's been said before, but eve's tough--especially when you've got creative minds at the controls of your opposition. nowhere in the eve galaxy is safe. play, learn, get even if you can."
1/12/2010,i know what you mean. but the game dosnt allow you to get even like that. i think to get even it would be any ore thieft or can flippers or whatever litte discusting tricks they use to leave them falg for a month so they undock and you see them undocking and you have the opportunity to blow them off you can hunt them down . i am not saying they are the scum or anything like that i am just saying they have the opportunity to grief. and i dont agree the game i paid tricked me into thinking i am in a safe enviroment when in fac**** rewarded to grief. if i had fun doing things like that i think this would had been the game i play. it just needs people to think they are playing something you will actually have fun and it does a great job in desiving people into playing and then to get this kind of suprice specially if you playing hard and honest. anways it dosnt matter i think after all this is a free gameor i think it should be. if you going to have griefers i wouldnt care if its free. but when you pay and have this kind of results to loose your real money and time in this? no i will problably be mad for the next 3 days and forget i subscribe and let it to be cancel again. at least the 5 days was free i guess. but i have nothing to come back for.
1/12/2010,"okay, three things. 1) the enter key. 2) the shift key. 3) you played eve long enough to be flying a golem, and you didn't know that if you shoot at someone they get the right to shoot back? you deserved to lose it. if you were in your nice new vexor or drake, i might feel pity, but a golem pilot ought to know better. for that matter, you're flying a mission boat with utility highs and a tractor bonus - why was there anything left for them to steal? you have brought disgrace to carebears everywhere."
1/12/2010,1 thing. it's only the most obvious troll i've ever seen. op: you don't even get 1/10. weak as they come.
1/12/2010,i am just stating a fact in eve that make this possible. to be able to trick somebody that you are in a confort zone 0.9 and its allow to this guy to steal from me get taged fly away and he this with all the intention to ransom me and blow up my ship. my records should show i have never fought in pvp. no experience how it works. the guy got tagged with me he flew for 3 minutes without attacking i assumed that he was able to continue for those 3 minutes to steal from me becouse i didnt attack. in effect he left once i attack. no intention to blow him off i didnt care for a kill mail for a destroyer. if i knew what to do in that case when he left i would had finish salvage and left the area where he could had come back and not able to destroy my ship. ironic enough his corp is called yarr or something like that. i guess a pirate wannaby. so is safe to asume they like to grief. either way my proposal is to make a guide for pvp in the game not something you have to spend 2 hours to understand the mechanic and say eh it can be done. if they get taged should be a pop up saying for the next 15 minutes no matter where he is he can attack you if hyou attack him. that simple i lost my ship they lost my subscription threrethats behind but they could add that litte message in the future and i wouldnt call that griefing. laack of education in this game is my complain.
1/12/2010,this
1/12/2010,ok i dont understand what shift and enter does? and yes i did got a golem after 3 months of grinding missions not pirating for ransom or doing pvp. the pvp of the eve element is just perfect for 0.5 i assume becouse thats is what the game tells you that you leaving secure area. but in 0.9 there is no warning. well anyways i hope the points goes trhu and they put this warning hey you getting stealed dont defend yourself becouse they just want to tag you back and blow you for ransomson.period.
1/12/2010,you mean to tell me that you've played through the game long enough to get a golem and you have no concept or understanding of combat mechanics?and you also claim to now understand the shift key and the enter key on your own keyboard?ok... this is a troll... yep... definitely a troll.
1/12/2010,i am the victim and you guys call me a troll? oh well. my main language is not english. making fun of me dosnt get anywhere. shift and enter you guys problably means that i dont capitalise after periods and dont hit enter. if thats it . then it dosnt have anything to do with the issue. an yes i have not played pvp all my life in eve. the game you can train without playing it when i got the golem was the pinacle of my money. if i strive to build money i would problably invested in the tengu wich i can fly but dont have the money or a carrier but dont have the money. the game lets you advance without actually playing the game. i didnt know it was a sin not to log in everyday and not play pvp.i dont spect my ship back. hopefully my money i spend in the subscription would be nice but that will not happent. but if they add some features to the game so things like this dosnt happent is all i ask. any other comments not related directly to stop griefers i will ignore becouse dosnt make any sense.
1/12/2010,"they are referring to the fact that your post is one giant wall of text with no paragraph structure (the enter key) and no capitalization (the shift key). it is not unreadable that way but you are asking people to do extra work to read a post that is essentially you whining that you haven't learned anything about the game in three months. if you alienate people before you even present your argument, you aren't going to get a positive response."
1/12/2010,you left out the bit about flying a golem...
1/12/2010,ah. i understand. is no biggy. is just a game that can be improve or not.
1/12/2010,"most people who play eve wouldn't consider it an improvement. you undocked, you agreed to the possibility of losing your stuff. i couldn't unravel whether you actually had a proposal, or what it was if you did, from that wall of text, but i'd imagine that any proposal you have would utterly destroy what most eve players think is something that makes the game what it is. if you want a game where griefing is looked down upon, there's plenty on the market. eve is a game where you're expected to be able to take care of yourself - either learn to do so better(and we will help with that, if you want it - the game may be cruel, but the players aren't generally), or decide that you can't and walk away."
1/12/2010,actually you are right. now that i think about it. is the freedom to do anything you like in this game even the danger to encounter pirates. but then i again i was in a safe sector. 0.9 where the police is around i think if someone steals the police will come and get you but then again it wouldnt be fun for everybody. just a small warning should be great when pvp is about to engage is all i was thinking about. but i think after a shower and looking back to the game i feel like i was just grinding for money to buy better modules now i think have the opportunity to sit back and rethink what i would like to do next if i decide to play eve. thx guys for the ones were diplomatic enought to make the posting constructive.
1/12/2010,"if all you want is better notifications, i don't think anyone will argue very strongly against you. making sure that people have some way of knowing what they're getting into is important. you seemed to be asking for game mechanic changes, which is why we all jumped down your throat."
1/12/2010,i am sorry i think i feel i need a translator sometimes. i try my best to express myself. yes the idea is better notification to understand what i get into.specially if i am about to loose a pve ship my golem to a educated pvp player.i think i will subscribe to eve i am installing again the game. problably this time around i will be a miner. hoepfully there is not a big a surprice again.
1/12/2010,"please, use the enter key, it's there for a reason ;)and, as a miner, depending on where you are, you will also encounter can flippers. are you sure you want to attack them using the few medium drones in your paper thin retriever?carebear-eve has 1 rule in large friendly letters: don't engage in pvp in your pve- or mining ship. you should know that by now :) the golum was driving the message home hard, but you'll probably don't forget it now :)"
1/12/2010,obvious troll is increasingly obvious.
1/12/2010,"commonwealth, let me tell you that you're being called a ""troll"", but in all honesty i haven't read a reply that's coherent or simply intelligent, to your original post,which by the way only an imbecile would not understand correctly, even if it's not correctly puntuated or in perfect english.in instead understand your point perfectly, since i too believe that if you like pve, and every player has a right to enjoy it above all else, you shouldn't be shafted for it, just because.i already posted around about this, since we pve players (called carebears) are the joke of some mongoloids that frequent the forums:"

1/12/2010,"the issue:gas mining requires too much micro-management due to the fast harvester cycle times and is a logistical pita for wormhole miners.the brief:to create a gas mining vessel that is cheap and versatile enough for mining capsuleers to risk flying in w-space but not so overpowered that it is impossible for a roaming gang to catch, i.e. no warp strength bonus or cloaky warps; that looks good and is not a t2 bantam; and that doesnt crash the gas market by being too uber.reading other schemes posted involve giving t1 mining frigs a new variant (who really wants to fly a t2 bantam?) or giving the skiff a new bonus (its a mercoxit specialist) and creating the oft-asked gas strip harvesters.i can't find my original idea in the features forum, but it was complicated and also involved gas strip harveys. so here is the nessus v2.the proposalore, having seen the growing market in t3 ship production, saw the need to create a dedicated vessel to meet the growing requirements of gas miners risking their lives in unknown territories.using the latest technologies in light metal alloys and inspired by the prototype zephyr scanning boat, ore have created a light, fast ship capable of absorbing radio waves used by current capsuleer scanning methods. as a result the nessus will not show up on combat probe scans. to create such a vessel meant removing most of the armour; however as a positive side-effect this hulk-size ship has a mass similiar to the lighter gallente cruisers.the hull-type is covetor/hulk (black skin?), but with armour and hull hp like a skiff.the upside for minersless need for a hauler; no need for jet-can mining; less mass use on the wormhole; less micromanagement of moving a few units of gas around every two minutes. the downside for minersstill no afking. if you are found, youre pretty much kb marmalade on cold toast.the upside for piratesbeing unable to probe out the nessus directly may seem like a heavy penalty, however, you can still just probe down the actual gas sites (and heaven forbid i suggest, as a miner myself, cloak up and wait for us). hell, you could even train to fly it yourself... think of the opportunities a non-scannable ship could have! and now youve got exhumers, you can help out at your corps next mining op. you know you want to . and of course, reduced mass use on whs also benefits everyone using the wormhole.i was thinking maybe the nessus wouldnt show up on d-scan too, but i figure a) thats maybe too much of an edge (more for the war-dec/piracy angle tbh), and b) probably complex to implement since d-scan is closely tied to the overview, although of course that needs a major overhaul itself.main skill requirementsgas harvesting v, exhumers i (with all the usual pre-reqs)bonusesmining barge  5% to all shield resistsexhumers  5% reduction to gas harvester and mining laser cycle time per levelspecial abilitiescannot be probed with combat probes400% bonus to gas harvest yieldpenalty 100% increase in gas harvest cycle timefittinghi slots = 4, with 3 turrets (can only fit gas harvesters or turret-based mining lasers) and 1 utility highmid slots = 2low slots = 3rig slots = 2native statsshield hp = 1819em = 37.5exp = 65kin = 50therm = 62.5armour hp = 450em = 70exp = 10kin = 15therm = 45structure hp = 505max velocity = 257m/smax cargo = 2500m3dedicated gas hold = 5500m3 (so 8000m3 total gas capacity)drone bay = 25m3/bandwidth 50agility = comparable to a blockade runnermoving the hulks 3rd mid to a high gives a utility slot for a core launcher or standard cloak and the 4th mid to a low also further reduces shield tanking ability but allows greater flexibility/strategic fitting for stabs/agility /expanders/mlus (if fitting mining lasers). 400% yield bonus means you effectively get 6 harvesters on only 3 turrets (thus removing the need for a new ship model, however much we miners would like one)."
1/12/2010,"if my figures are correct eft yield would show 380 at 76s cycle time, compared with 316 with 5 harveys at 76s, and of course the nessus yield would increase with the exhumers skill cycle time reduction. so the bonus is perceptible, but should not be spectacularly market-crashing, unless lots of new gas miners are created (in which case, make the bonus 300% so that ferox is still faster on eft, but with the logistical pita hauling then entails).hull price? 60-70m. its a way bigger risk to fly than a ferox, but waaay cheaper than a heavily tanked gas-strategic cruiser.comments, thoughts, suggestions and supports!thanks for reading./jyn"
1/12/2010,"i don't see the need of this as gas mining is currently balanced as-is. i do not like your immunity to combat probes. no ship should get this, least of all a mining vessel. (speaking as a miner). also, you make the skill book pointless as last i checked it could use 5 gas miners. you planning on returning the wasted sp on lvl 5? and no mining vessel should get a utility slot so that idea has to go as well. so much wrong with your idea i have to say you need to chuck it out the window."
1/12/2010,"now that's a carebear's dream right?i would welcome the dedicated gas harvester bonus on a t2 mining barge, but that feature is a no-go for me! but then again, i don't believe a dedicated gas harvester ship makes a lot of sense...t2 gas harvesters are pretty easy to train for and their yield is sufficient. i don't believe that if ccp had the option to create a new ship, any ship with such a weak role would make the cut.i'd rather see a mining ship with the ability to have some decent tank / firepower to defend itself or -something- else than that.my 2 iskqp"
1/12/2010,"gas mining is pretty much standard jetcan mining. i'm not too terribly offended by that. i have no particular objection to a gas exhumer, but your proposal is a bad one - you say that a stab bonus is too strong, but want to give it immunity to probing? that's crazy talk."
1/12/2010,"thanks for your replies. here are my responses.i'm basically trying to think outside the box a little. i don't really see non-probable ship (which we already have with covops - which won't even show on the d-scan of course, this idea would) as a carebear dream as finding an alternative to miners trying to tank against pvpers. unless you're always able to have a couple of hac backups through a wormhole 200mil of hulk is not likely going to survive long, so tank is pretty meaningless on a mining boat in pvp territory - that's why the skiff has the warp strength bonus. it's not always about tank.if a roaming gang sees this ship on their d-scan, they know i'm out there, but they'll have to find the site i'm at (and maybe warp bubble the wh exits?). once they find the sites they can warp to the middle of the gas site, leaving them the choice of shooting the miner at range or flying the 20-30km to scram, or get their covops/falcon in close for a direct warp in. meanwhile, the miner has a non-fighting chance of survival by being alert and agile, using their d-scan as usual, having a few seconds to get to warp if the pirates only get the 45km warp-in position (and haven't bubbled the exit).@isaac, with the stats i listed gas harvey v on the barge with t2 harveys is giving you 6 effective turrets so i don't see that as wasted sp, besides which you need gas v to get t2 harvies anyway, so gas miners are likely to have that regardless. besides, you can continue to fly with 5 turrets on a turret bc, continue jet-can mining with all the risks and hauling that involves. i think that's a reasonable choice a pilot/corp can make.the might be an issue with scouts then using this ship to close down 0.0 systems by warping to a safe somewhere, but then that's no different again to someone cloaking in a covops. they too can't do anything else other than report intel, and the idea of a mining ship stopping 0.0 belt ratting carebears from leaving their station quite appeals.in terms of a mining ship having firepower, i think that has to remain the realm of a few light or med drones or fleet support./jyn"
1/12/2010,"op's solution is foolish... and overkill.screams carebears wetdream.not even exhumers have it that good.skiff has a +2 warp stab bonus but at the cost of capacity and efficiency (1 high slot and itty bitty cargo bay/drone bay/tank)solution - ""gas strip miner"" to be employed on mining barge/exhumereasy... less work for ccp.restrict it to the procurer/skiff (not widely used) class if you wana get picky.... but new ship is not needed."
1/12/2010,too overpowered... unprobable? really?
1/12/2010,"yup, you're right. someone should suggest a nerf to cloaks sometime"
1/12/2010,better than immunity to probing
1/12/2010,"heh, maybe. but being immune to a direct hit with a combat probe is not the same as immunity from being found like a covops.i'm genuinely interested to know if you are anti the idea because it would be overpowered, in which case, why is it overpowered? or simply because it might take a couple of minutes more to locate someone mining by locating the gas field, rather than finding the ship directly and having the miner warp scrammed within seconds of getting a hit on a combat probe?some posters in ""nerf cloaks"" threads have a real beef about covops frigs and blockade runners and yet despite warp with cloak, those ships still end up on killboards, sometimes due to pilot error, sometimes due to smart enemy tactics and occasionally to a bit of enemy luck. since mining vessels can't fight -and i think shouldn't be able to- is it unreasonable to suggest a way to give a miner a slightly higher chance to survive? a tank approach doesn't work, just look at the number of drakes lost in w-space. but drakes can at least try and fight back and are insurable.so perhaps take out the utility high, and the ship can only fit the lasers/harvesters, therefore can't cloak up or probe out a wh if the pilot is forced to use logoff tactics, or make an off-grid safe somewhere. i simply feel this could be a way of creating new tactics for both hunters and their prey, all while making the task of building t3 ships a fraction easier./jyn"
1/12/2010,"for people who spent forever training up hictors they really dont have a great of a role in combat as their smaller cousins dictors do ( at least in 0.0 )i was thinking increasing the bubble range to 30km would make more sense, and make them more useful in 0.0 fights / large combat fleets.as it is now dictors are the go to tackle but die very often, this change seems like a good balance between the 2."
1/12/2010,umm.........................................what? you can tackle and hold supercaps. how is that not a role??! you have a giant tank! you have the ability to force engagements. i think this is a good enough role.
1/12/2010,dictors who die frequently are either stupid (in the sense of going forth without backup) or poorly fitted.not supported.ps: dictor pilots should expect to get primaried.... with that in mind... your not likely to solo various things unless you know you can tank it.
1/12/2010,"i think its good to have the heavy dictor to be boosted with more shield or armour (depends on ship type). this will increase their effective hitpoints on a passive tank. they have the habbit of melting fast when u use them for their intended role (tackle supercaps). light dictor and heavy dictor have good roles. i dont think u can compare those two. however i think 30km is too much. 26km with l5 skills is better, just enough to make a differance for the few months of training extra and the extra risk. more will become a bit too much i guess..."
1/12/2010,"might i be the one point out that these premiums aren't worth it? a cerberus costs about 20-30 times as much as a caracal, but if you put a cerberus against 20-30 caracals it'd be vapourized before you could even finish saying ""isn't this analogy rather tortured?"" t2 ships are brutally effective in 1v1 match-ups against their t1 counterparts, but are not cost-effective in the slightest.frankly, i don't see why they even bother having insurance in the game for t2 ships at all. i think it needs fixing so that platinum insurance covers at least half the cost of the ship. this would soften the blow without making it possible to replace the ship almost for free."
1/12/2010,wrong.base price is fixed according the following numbers:tritanium: 1pyerite: 4mexallon: 16isogen: 64nocxium: 256zydrine: 1024megacyte: 4096
1/12/2010,"the fact that people fly these ships disproves your point. people are flying in them and dying in them in pvp on a regular basis. you appear to have some unwarranted sense of entitlement which dogs all bears today. why should the 'blow' be softened? if you don't want to fly a t2 ship then by all means shell out on 20-30 t1 hulls, this is the option you have. if everyone was able to afford to lose t2 ships on a regular basis where would we be then? where would the new benchmark be?"
1/12/2010,personally i'm waiting for the t3 battleships and the sudden surge of whiny posts about how it takes too long to train battleship 5.
1/12/2010,"ok, different angle. if they made t2 insurable for anything resembling market value, it would cause massive inflation."
1/12/2010,has my support for a number of reasons
1/12/2010,"maybe, but what info would it show? and that seems like something that works much better in a trailer, with uncluttered camera angles, than in actual eve where it's more likely to get in the way. this seems like too much work for too little benefit to me."
1/12/2010,"any info would be better than the current situation. currently you just see that you have something targeted in that direction. all the actually useful and necessary information is displayed in other parts of the screen. even a different color targeting reticle or a small icon for corp, fleet, blues, reds, wartargets would be of some help, although this is more of an issue with the info(lack of) with the target icons.basicly some of the info you currently have to fish out from the overview and look at which target it corresponds to could also be implemented as visual markers on the view screen/locked target. it would just make things more convenient and the more customation you allow the better the feature.edit: the idea is to have visual markers for the info instead of having to read the info when ever possible. it is faster to take in and would help to reduce the need to 'fly by overview'."
1/12/2010,agreed...maybe show distance to target and transversal velocity for starters.
1/12/2010,"after dominion the lag it's horrible.maybe the new tcu-s mechanics generate this problem with the infinity spawns or i dont know why.before pre-patch a 100 members fleet in 0.0 flaw without problem, but now everything is laggy. in fleet jump everyone got infinity lagspikes between 3-5 secs. 30-60 sec need for a gatejump when 100 mans fleet went another system.300 vs 300 battles unplayable if the nods not in reinforced mode.

1/12/2010,"what this proposal is:a reccommendation that the csm preemptively demonstrate to ccp the community's support for hulkageddon. this proposal does not seek to address insurance, sec status loss, concord reaction times, training time for gank destroyers or any of the other possible nerfs to hulkageddon. this proposal is non-specific. please do not attempt to turn this proposal into an argument about anything specific.there is nothing that i have seen that makes me believe ccp plans to nerf hulkageddon. i just believe that we have to demonstrate a united support for the event in order to ensure ccp maintains a hands-off approach. i would merely like to have the csm let ccp know face to face that we, as a majority of the engaged eve community, support the existence of player created events that make inventive use of game mechanics to provide the community with entertaining game play. specifically in this instance, hulkageddon. let's not wait until hulkageddon goes the way of privateer alliance.(edit because i can't spell)"
1/12/2010,"laugh! nice troll.about the only examination i would ever care to see resulting from this laughable lameness is an overview of its impact on the market (or complete lack thereof). i'm sure that there are more than a few souls in the market forum with enough understanding of the market to perform such an analysis. only ccp can look deeper still to see how much is idiotageddon affecting things or other factors such as moon trash, mining (or lack of), and just plain old market manipulation (lvv)."
1/12/2010,"i have no idea what this is supposed to accomplish. i don't see any nerf inbound, and expressing generic support for pvp is something that can pretty easily be discerned in any eve-related conversation of any length with a solid majority of the csm members."
1/12/2010,"the contract/escrow system has been much improved over the years from the agony of its initial inception. it could, however, use a few more adjustments.in item category i would like to be able to check for either blueprint (original) or blueprint (copy) as well as any blueprint of either manner. it would lower db calls when sorting for such.or an indicator if the contract is for a copy or original without having to view it.in item group i would find it just as convenient to search for entire categories rather than simply one particular item at a time. example: ammunition (rather than a specific type) or modules/ship equipment as opposed to just 'hybrid weapons'. in this regard i am still talking about blueprints which, if you select, you cannot break it down by groups and are forced to go through each type individually (which is a major time wasting pita).missiles needs to be split into 'advanced missiles' and normal missiles, just as all other ammunition types.and i think everyone can agree that there should be a way to remove 'want to buy' annoyances."
1/12/2010,"wtb scams can be removed with the minimum price function, if i recall. i don't bother, myself, so i can't vouch for that. as for the rest of it, it's a bit fiddly, but yes, you seem to be thinking along the right lines."
1/12/2010,"i would like to advance the idea of a sticky on this forum in which topics that consistently come up (pos, destroyers, war declaration, ect ect ect) can be linked for easy access so that they don't keep getting reiterated with new posts because people can't find, or are to lazy to look for? make the thread locked for csm or mod editing only.we have it in market discussions, science, and ship fittings forums already (seldom updated, but better than the same old threads repeating ad nauseum).thanks,stoner."

1/12/2010,"proposal make a negative wallet a more permanent problem by instituting penalties to carrying a negative wallet balance when set by a gm for buying isk, as opposed to situations where a capsuler might end up with a negative wallet through normal game mechanics. it is important that this be done only when a gm has reclaimed the illegal funds and not for any other situation.currently when a player buys isk they can use it to make purchases or give it to an alt/other account character. if the first case when ccp discovers this they can ban the account or take back the bought isk which if the player spent 'bought isk' it can make their wallet have a negative balance. in this situation they have gotten away with using the isk to gain an item/ship/etc and can benefit from it. even worse if the player used a separate account to buy the isk they could get ill gotten items/ships to another account that might escape gm punishment and throw away the account that purchased the isk. if using an alternate character on the same account trade items to their main and biomass the alt with the negative wallet thus 'escaping' the negative isk situation. any of these situations allows the player to get away with their violation of the eula and in certain situation face no real penalty, biomass the alt make a new one. i suggest that when the account is given a negative wallet by gm interaction removing ill gotten isk that a flag be set causing several penalties to be placed in effect until the wallet is no longer in debt.1)the character with the negative wallet cannot be biomassed, or traded until the wallet is no longer in debt, locking up a character slot.2)the character cannot use contracts or do in station trading to other characters.3)have the character with the negative wallet have their skill queue locked so it cannot train any more skills. the queue would finish any skills in it and at the end any of the other two character slots on that account could train skills but the character with the negative wallet would not be able to.4)perhaps: the character cannot alter their skill queue, skills continue training until the queue is emptied and no new skills can be added. the skill queue is locked preventing training an alternate character on the same account as well. if this is chosen then option 3 is not needed, i see this as a more extreme measure and it can be argued it is too extreme.i leave the penalties somewhat flexible and the above are my suggestions, there are arguments for and against them as well for other penalties. the spirit of this idea is to not make it 'impossible' to keep playing a characters that has done this but still make the gain of ill gotten isk less likely or easy, by having some more consequences.this won't address all the problems with someone buying isk and still 'gaining' from it even after ccp steps in but it can do something about certain situations. there are ways to get around the burden of having a negative wallet but still possessing the ill gotten items/ships assuming ccp doesn't do anything about them. ccp has stated they do not want to punish players:"
1/12/2010,i'd default to ccp's view on making it more of an impact as we don't get the meeting minutes on issues where characters have bought isk and why one was banned and another only had the isk removed.
1/12/2010,if your going to request harsher punishment you might as well request the account buying the isk be banned all together as you've effectively shut them down as it is.but then they would say its too harsh...and thus your proposal is also... too harsh... even slightly less.can't support something like that.main reason : you'll crush first time offenders who have no idea why or where when it comes to isk buying.
1/12/2010,"i disagree here for two specific reasons. 1) the player would be under pressure to solve their negative balance or suffer skill training penalties. this could cause them to either leave the game, or worse, simply use rmt again rather then take a skill hit. the only other option would be purchasing plexes, which would imply they have to ""pay"" ccp to get their account working properly again. 2) gms do sometimes get it wrong regarding who is involved in rmt and who is not. there are always a few who get punished unfairly and have to peition, escalate, and escalate again to get their ability to play eve normally back. sadly, i doubt this will ever change. under your proposals these players would most likely just cancel their accounts. imagine simply playing eve and suddenly you log in to find you have been accused, found guilty, and punished without ever doing anything wrong. this would certainly make any player lose their desire to play -which ccp doesn't want. your first suggestion regarding character termination and trading i think is great, though. this should not be allowed. this is a great convo and i hope some other options are considered -such as time period based banning of repeat offenders using credit card numbers, etc. to track them, and such."
1/12/2010,"afaik, you cannot trade or use contracts because of the broker fees...you can't even sell anything i don't believe."
1/12/2010,"what you propose might as well be a permaban. a player with a negative wallet cannot contract or market goods, and now you want to prevent station trade as well. that leaves them no way to dig out of the hole except outright donations. furthermore, you're telling them that they can't train skills until they've gotten a donation - gee, i wonder what effect it would possibly have to tell people that they have to secure a donation asap in order to have a chance of keeping their character even slightly usable. don't be dumb - you know perfectly well where those ""donations"" are likely to come from if the guy has already bought isk once. i'm all for dealing harshly with people who do things like rmt, but what you propose isn't harsh, it's just counterproductive. if you're worried about disposable characters taking the rmt and then passing it along, then follow the money afterwards. don't tell people their characters are permanently ruined unless they rmt again and somehow manage to avoid detection. that's just silly."
1/12/2010,"go to your room son, adults are talking."
1/12/2010,so... is anything going to be brought up concerning the rather inept war declaration system we're currently forced to endure?there have been many suggestions on the topic over the years (far too many to even begin to link); the current approach seems to be toward using a contract style system that allows for surrender terms or counter-offers from the targets.likewise war flag persistence on a pilot level to limit the rampant abuse of corp/alliance hopping.
1/12/2010,"we can't raise a vague proposal about wardecs and just point ccp at ""too many threads to link"" if you want to put together a consolidated proposal in the assembly forum then we'll look at it and put it on the agenda. if you are waiting for one of us to do it for you then you'll have to wait a bit longer till the initial rush of already raised proposals have been dealt with..."
1/12/2010,i know i am not a csm person but can someone on the csm please take up this issue. remove the gallente experimental storylines where pve missions runners are forced to fw pvp and go into camped low sec systems.i have given my views in other threads:
1/12/2010,"totally agree. the ability to move the camera focal point left/right on a slider would also be handy not only for dual monitor users but those who prefer a wider overview, stacked windows or room for the now much improved browser."
1/13/2010,i was honestly horrified when i read what poss actually were graphically. please. this.
1/13/2010,"well, i'm actually familiar with insurance in eve, but the reading thing is new. i gave it a try, and here's what i found:the concord assembly alliance includes the corporations: concord, ded, inner circle, and secure commerce commission. concord is the corporation that destroys your ship when you do something naughty. the secure commerce commission is who you pay in order to insure a ship (if you read your wallet journal with the reference type set to ""insurance,"" you will see that this is where your payment goes). you are actually correct in that concord specifically does not make the insurance payment--it comes from an entity called ""eve central bank,"" which is not an npc corporation (there is, however, a player corp by that name, but the entities are not the same).however, when your ship is destroyed and you receive said insurance payment, you receive an eve-mail from the scc that looks something like this:-----insurancefrom: secure commerce commissionsent: date timerefid:######### your friendly insurance company has transferred ######### isk into your account for the recent loss of your ship. -----so, concord blows you up, and the scc--in the same alliance, the concord alliance--orders the payment for your ship. thus, the concord assembly destroys your ship and orders that you be payed for it. it doesn't pay you specifically, but it is the reason that you get paid.i submit, again, that this is highly illogical. do you have any more snide comments or quibbles?"
1/13/2010,"currently suicide ganking is no risk business. even less so than mining or missionrunning, there you at least have the small risk of losing your expensive ship and modules and cargo, while suicidegankers can work with free ships and practically free modules. so even if they fail at what they do, they still don't really take any dent in their wallets.i don't really care how it is done, but zero-risk business practices should be removed. complete insurance overhaul would be the best solution, but removing insurance from concorded ships would be a start.supported for the sake of insurance overhaul, not neccessarily in the way suggested in the op."
1/13/2010,"ganking is a no risk business?completely not true. ganks fail all the time, costing the gankers time and sec status (as well as the ship, which is a cost, when ships costs are higher)but that said, lets play your game and 'remove insurance from suicide ganking'.ganking a hulk is hardly a profitable enterprise, even now - with cheap t1 ships available.removing insurance means it would cost a battleship/bc ganker (like myself) 30-40m + fittings just to attempt a gank on a hulk. destroyed t2 fit hulks drop, at best 5-10m in mods.result of your nerf? unless the hulk was faction fit - there is no way to profit from ganking one - in fact, it would become a very expensive hobby, at best. translation: extremely rare, or simply not occurring.mining in a hulk now becomes a completely risk-free business activity. what were you just saying about that? they should be removed?oh. you i think you forgot to say that you just meant 'risk free pvp activity' should be removed, while pve should be all profit, no risk."
1/13/2010,"this should not be about suicide ganking. lets face it, the insurance pay for a destroyer is small compared to the possible gain by suicide ganking, so i do not think it would have a very large effect on it.people will still suicide gank and make profit from it.those who support suicide ganking must still admit it does not make sense for an ally of concord to pay out for ships destroyed in criminal activity.the points made about inflation and insurance fraud are good ones.that does not change the fact that this insurance issue makes no sense.i think the only way to fix the problems that generate the need for suicide ganking is to fix the problems with war decs.either way, i dont think making this change to insurance pay would have that big an effect, though i do agree there might be a small amount of reduction in suicide ganking.but i would also point out that there are tons of things in eve that are there for balanced gameplay, and that dont make sense, i dont know if this particular issue is where i would make my stand on what should be realistic or not."
1/13/2010,"for those complaining about logic in terms of concord paying for suicide gank insurance, consider this:* u can hear guns and missiles when they're being shot and explosions, yet there's no air in space to carry the sound waves* one little frigate is strong enough to warp jam and webify a huge battleship, hell, even a carrier or dreadnought* u can warp through any object, whether it's a station, planet, or asteroid unharmed but on conventional drives, it would be like hitting a wall and u cannot start warp like this either* u cannot warp in a random direction because u have to align to a celestial object ""for your warp drives to lock onto it""* u cannot lock onto another ship to warp to it, even if it's not moving at all* u can only warp into the deadspace ""entrance"" but u can warp out of deadspace no matter how deep u r in it* microwarpdrives still function inside a warp bubble but not deadspace* the sling bubble effectthe list goes on and on--my point is logic, in terms of realism, shouldn't be a basis for debating this because the creators can shape that aspect to their liking, whether it would be for uniqueness or balance. it's science fiction, after all."
1/13/2010,"supported, no insurance payout for concord kills."
1/13/2010,"what gets me is that all the pirates who trumpet about ""risk vs reward"" being such a big part of eve and constantly call for carebearing aspects to be nerfed because they're too ""rewarding"" without being ""risky"" enough want to be able to effectively suicide gank for free because, uh......i'm sure a reason will come up soon...admit it, pirates; you just want suicide ganking to be free so you can continue to do it for the lulz rather than for profit."
1/13/2010,"suicide ganking is ""free"" because there is an oversupply of minerals.if you want to actually help miners, you will look at why this is so. and consider the fact that mining doesn't even supply 50% of the minerals produced in the game.when i started playing eve, a raven cost ~134 million isk, so it cost something like 40-50 mill to lose one after insurance. consequently, battleships were rarely used for suicide ganking."
1/13/2010,"it is widely talked about that eve is like real life and therefore not safe.in real life if someone is caught by police he not only get a punishment (in our case its the loss of the ship), but also he is not insured anymore (would need to be introduced) and if he has got the money he as to pay the damage he caused (i.e. not only the truck but also the freight i.e. other cars).this would mirror life more realistic. thats no whining, just pure facts.so if someone ganks a iteron 5 with 6 catalyst in a myrm he should loose insurance for the myrm, pay the iteron (probably with or without rigs) and the cargo. at least in 0.5-1.in low sec there should be only the loss of insurance as its more like wild west (but still you loose insurance cause of ""improper use""."
1/13/2010,"i agree with the proposal. it is not suicide ganks i have an issue with, but being able to suicide gank with no risk of loss to yourself is a bit much."
1/13/2010,"comparing things to real life is nonsense....but....in 'real life' criminals get away with their crimes about 50% of the time. and thats murder cases in the usa, its probably far more often in violent places like colombia or nigeria. in terms of lesser crimes, escaping punishment is far more common.does that mean you want people to be able to escape concord (and all consequences of their actions) at least half the time? or more? i'd be in favor of that - it would offer 'risk' to the situation, after all - especially if you want to increase the penalty for getting concorded."
1/13/2010,"i disagree with this. it is the resemblance of real life that allows an immersive environment like eve to permit a player's suspension of disbelief. the fiction of it makes it gratifying when we can accept it as at least plausible enough to enjoy without doubting the experience. when aspects of a game reach the extremities of believability--the criteria for which we base on our own real-life experiences--then we begin to doubt the game and basically call bs on it. this is where the concord/insurance problem comes into play: if the police shoot out the tires on my car in a high-speed chase, i seriously doubt that geico is going pay for the wreck that follows shortly thereafter.not to stray too far off-topic, but i'm heavily in favor of a concord revamp. i think the current form of concord is more magic than anything--they can appear anywhere and everywhere, regardless of circumstances. then they just loiter for a bit and then vanish.converting them into some kind of detect-and-pursuit force would add mountains of room for player-pirate creativity. i'm all for it."
1/13/2010,"once again, it's never free. in addition to the risk of failing, u're already guaranteed to take a security hit the instant u start shooting and it only gets a lot worse if u succeed. and if u fail, the victim will have the lulz at your expense so essentially, u and your fleet r the ones who lost security for his lulz. and regaining that much security lost isn't risk-free either. the same risks and guaranteed penalties go for everyone else that takes part in the suicide gank. and for what? if it's not a hauler carrying valuable loot that's the target but a hulk carrying extremely bulky ore, where's the profit in that?bottom line is from the instant we accept the concord warning, we're already paying in some way as is and in case u forgot, there's nothing wrong with doing something just for fun--it's still a game."
1/13/2010,"i support this, and if i wasn't lazy, i'd start up 500 alts and support this as well.zero risk ganking of 150-200mil ships is total bs, and hulkageddon benefits from this quite a bit.not saying that this is just for hulkageddon, zero risk ganking is a loophole to be sure.there should be zero percent insurance payout if concord asploded said ship. if you're not ganking someone, and you get concorded, you either got tricked, or failed hard, and you just paid for a lesson.-skanps. to the poster above me, anna:bottom line is from the instant we accept the concord warning, we're already paying in some way as is and in case u forgot, there's nothing wrong with doing something just for fun--it's still a game.really? i mean, seriously? 200mil does not equal a sec status hit, plus possibly implants. it's not even, equal, or the the same.if you need it broken down further, i can try going barney style, and use one syllable words."
1/13/2010,"that last part was funny, considering it included something to the effect of ""i'm gonna pimp out my clone and hulk with the very best mods i can get and afk mine in a place where i can still be shot at and if anyone does kill me and my pod, it's just wrong."" and i assume u're gonna stand there with a ""wtf"" look on your face when u're ejected into your pod? do u have any idea at all how much the sec loss is from podding? no of course not--that's probably why u factored that in too right? if u need it broken down further, i can trying going barney style and using one syllable words too: that... is... your... own... fault. it's your own fault u loaded your clone and ship with overly expensive mods, it's your own fault u thought u were completely safe when it's called ""high security"" and not ""complete security"", and it's your own fault u didn't even attempt to save your pod."
1/13/2010,"supported, suicide ganking should cost the ganker something significant not just a risk of failure; a security hit that can be made up easily farming some decent l4's, and a few million or so for fittings-if that. suicide should be to impose 'grief' or otherwise strike a target that cannot be hit any other way as it is. nearly every suiciding player risks practically nothing if they fail and stand to gain if they don't suicide an empty rookie ship or other worthless target which if that is their choice it should cost them much more. with insurance they are free to suicide anyone and anything provided they can gather enough like minded players to join them at minimal costs if the target isn't economically viable. barring making new penalties for suicide ganking, removing insurance payouts for doing so meaning concord killed you is the way to go."
1/13/2010,"only u don't gain security for every single rat u kill in just one system--that includes missions. it's only the highest rat every 15 minutes, give or take, per system. and try high sec ratting just for security and see how long it takes to get your status back from one ship kill."
1/13/2010,"i love how all the people complaining about ganking having 'no risk' conveniently forget about kill rights.any ganker can be aggressed - and have his ship destroyed for 30 days after a successful gank.gankers have to spend some time in space ratting up their sec-status, which means they are often vulnerable to attack in a pve-fit ship.my own 'kill-rights' page has nearly 40 people on it. any one of them could use a tracking agent to find me and get revenge. i mean, they dont - i guess because they would rather spend their time whining on these forums.....but the ccp provides all miners with the tools they need to get their revenge.so, quit complaining miners - go find and kill those gankers, quit trying to get ccp to do your work for you."
1/13/2010,its not realistic that eve's police force is omniscient and omnipotent.its not realistic that anyone in eve ever gets insurance for any of their ships considering how they are used.its not realistic that concord is omniscient when it comes to player pirates but happily ignores the gazillion of rats that run around in highsec missions.+++++how about that for realism in this game?

1/13/2010,"i so agree with this post.hybrids need some love, its not even funny anymoreccp hear our cry!"
1/13/2010,"as always, you've answered your own question without realizing it; because we don't debate with trolls. we allow them to make themselves look stupid and ignorant for as long as it amuses us and then we ignore them.and besides, we haven't ""run out of arguments"". we made all the arguments we need a long time ago; these arguments are correct and your counterarguments are completely delusional and without basis. we won the debate several pages back; like trolls everywhere, you just refuse to accept it. there is only one truth and it's blatantly on our side, but things like ""truth"" have little meaning to you.oh and just to get in before your reply: yes, i am arrogant. what of it? doesn't make me any less right.ok, i'm done with you now."
1/13/2010,"firstly, failing to effectively counter our points =/=defeating them.secondly, going off topic =/=defeating our counter arguments.thirdly, failing to provide adequate reason for the assertion that changing the caldari damage bonus to be rainbow will compensate for actual problems with individual ships is =/=defeating our counter arguments."
1/13/2010,"sure, as long as all missls get replaced with kinetic primary + therm secondary damage only, with missl variants differing by range and dps.your endurance on this proposal is quite impressive, i must say"
1/13/2010,"if i keep re-iterating the point its because this topic has a habit of galloping off topic into a purelly balance ( caldari v other races ) argument.some other proposed fixes , that go along the lines of x doesnt have enough grid and y weapon type is rofl dont address the issues raised in this thread.namely1. cmb bonuses are less valuable than other ships damage bonuses.( the worst damage bonuses in game atm )therefore it makes balancing ships at all player levels impossible2. training time spent on ship hulls is often wasted , leading to a situation where lvl1 cmb pilots are just as powerful as lvl5 cmb pilots.for cmb's to be competitive versus other ships without being overpowered at any particular player skill level then the value of there bonus needs to be the same as the value of the bonuses on other ships.seriossley i cant understand why people are afraid of cmb's having a 5% per level damage increase per player skill level like other races."
1/13/2010,"well, duh. that's because ""balance"", and the means of obtaining it, is exactly what this thread is about."
1/13/2010,from the op.effectivelly a level 5 pilot becomes no more effective at dealing damage than a level 1 pilot.
1/13/2010,"neither amarr nor gallente can pick and choose their damage types. therefore, they are only limited to em/thermal and kinetic/thermal respectively. on the other hand, caldari can pick and choose their damage types and, if they stick with kinetic, they get their damage bonus. this is much more desirable than a fixed damage type weapon platform, don't you think? because, personally, i would rather have the option to trade 20% of my dps so my guns can do a more lethal damage type, wouldn't you? minmatar is the only other race that can choose its damage types, but this benefit is mainly introduced to offset the low dps of its guns. now, here's the million dollar question: would you, dav, support a change to missiles so they do 60% kinetic and 40% (thermal, em or explosive) and change the caldari ship bonuses to apply to every missile? this solution also solves the two problems you've listed."
1/13/2010,"minmatar is the only other race that can choose its damage types, but this benefit is mainly introduced to offset the low dps of its guns. correct. good you understand!caldari is the race that can choose its damage types, but this benefit is mainly introduced to offset the low dps of its missiles. now do you understand this also ?damage switching races have low dps, and combat tactics require selection of ammo type to aim for holes.mini get all damage types bonused at 5% per level as they skill up hulls.caldari dont get all damage types bonused at 5% per level as the skill up hulls.yes if you read the op i would support split damage types on missiles.but at 25% fixed kin and 75% choice. similar to the ratio's on mini ammo."
1/13/2010,"dav, what you have to understand here is that we honestly dont see where the problem is; just because the numbers arent the same on paper it doesnt mean that balance doesnt already exist. changing the kin bonus would result in caldari being overpowered in a variety of ways, which would result either in the other 3 races being boosted, so that ultimately the situation returns to status quo before-boost (which would mean nothing has effectively changed) or there would be a resulting nerf to the caldari that would, given ccp's track record, be a nerf of disproportionate strength.the numbers may not be balanced, but the ships are; or at least the ones without unrelated/partially related problems are. there are issues surrounding dps parity other than the bonuses on ship-hulls that cause this parity, as such this proposal couldnt possibly be implemented without causing massive problems in general and severe imbalance issues across the board."
1/13/2010,"ok as you say you dont honestly see where the problem is i will try to break it down for you in a way that avoids the partisan issues.john and thomas are playing a computer game against each other( not neccessarily an rpg , could be any type of computer game rpg,fps,rts whatever )the game includes player skill leveling and different types of units.of those units some units get bonuses to the level of damage they can deal based on the players skill level.john is playing for the zog faction.thomas is playing for the goon faction.john has the balrog unit for doing heavy damage.thomas has the iidot unit for doing heavy damage.we know nothing about the differing abilitys of the units.both units allthough different , with different attack patterns are largelly equivelent in there potency as the game begins ( eg player level 0 ).john's balrog units gets a 10% per level scalar increase in the damage they do for every player skill level john has.thomas's iidot units also get a percentage scalar increase in the damage they do for every player skill level thomas has.by scalar , i mean the size of the damage is increase without affecting any other paramaters the units may have.what level of increase in damage does the iidot unit require in order to stay competitive with the balrog unit ?"
1/13/2010,"classifying the damage dealt into- low (when dealing non-bonused damage of a type that the opponent has high resists against)- medium (when dealing bonused damage against high resist, or dealing non-bonused against low resist)- high (when dealing bonused damage against low resist)then we have a situation where the caldari always deal at least medium damage if not high, where amarr and gallente can very well be dealing low. this balances out nicely with them getting bonuses for a primary + secondary damage type."
1/13/2010,"you assesment is incomplete.you make no mention of raw dps.leaving that aside for a minute even in your incomplete assesment.gal go from low - med > med - high as they skill upamarr go from low - med > med - high as they skill upmini go from always med > always high as they skill up ( yes you are naughty forgeting mini , deliberatelly i suspect as it blows your argument out the water )caldari go from med ( band b ) > med ( band a or band b ) with occasional high as they skill up.you need more band structures to account for raw dps and you need to include mini."
1/13/2010,"ah! thanks for the response. that exchange truly helped us understand each other's position.it seems that you feel that missile boats are imbalanced and in need of a buff, is that correct? you want this feature to be implemented to offset the incompetency of missile launchers compared to other weapon platforms?"
1/13/2010,"funny i read several times that caldari ships would be overpowered with such a change, oh wait, raven already has already bonus to all missiles, and it is not overpowered and no one uses caldari for serious fleets except for ecm ***ging. why? because of fitting problems that you have with shield transporters and missiles are useless in long range fights. beside that, you are always short on midslots with shield tanking because you still need mwd, cap booster and atleast a point (and sometimes you need a target painter too to be efficient)in short, what would this change do? boost small gang and solo warfare of caldari combat ships, but overpowered? never, but then i dont care"
1/13/2010,if you want to understand my position on the subject then you only need to read the op.if you feel that this post is purelly about cmb imbalance then eithera. i have not expressed the issue clearly enoughb. you have not read the op or taken the time to think about what i have said.
1/13/2010,"thank you for the reply.i have read the op and it seems that, indeed, this thread is purely about the imbalance of ships with +5% kinetic missile damage bonus. at least that is what i gathered from your op. of course, i may be completely wrong. in which case i invite you to set me straight on this matter. it is your thread after all."
1/13/2010,"well clearly it must be a. then.from the op and first reply post.""effectivelly a level 5 pilot becomes no more effective at dealing damage than a level 1 pilot.""""caldari damage bonus is not compatible with damage type switching combat tactics""looking at solo and small gang scenario'swhen an at least competent player flys a cmb, he will take a selection of missiles along with him.its an important aspect of cmb combat to select the correct missile for the target in exactly the same way a mini ac'd pilot will choose best ammo for target.can we agree on this ?if yes then take a look at this scenario.you ( flying a cara skill level 5 ) and 2 buddies ( also flying cara's skill lvl 2 ) are out and about being naughty pirates.you come across a drake in a belt that you want to poon.3 cara's can poon a drake , although if your taken dps from the drake you may have to warp out/in and let your buddies keep the points on.other combat stuff aside for one moment what ammo do you fire ?lets assume the drake is the cookie cutter 2xinv 2xlsb ab pointed variant.giving it around 50% em resists on its shields and 70% kin.you can fire thunderbolt at it , doing 50% damage per hitor you can fire kinitic at it doing 30% * 1.25 ( kin only bonus ) 37.5% damage per hit.so here we have a situation where your 2 buddies can do lets say 300dps per second on the drake by firing em.you as a level 5 pilot having spent 20 days or however long it is have no way to do more damage than them.essentially you have to discard your damage bonus in order to compete with a 2 day only nub , all other skills being equal.this is what is meant by these phrases.""effectivelly a level 5 pilot becomes no more effective at dealing damage than a level 1 pilot.""""caldari damage bonus is not compatible with damage type switching combat tactics""if it were 3 vexors or 3 stabbers or 3 omen that your group was flying it is a cast iron fact that all other stats being equal a level 5 [vexor|stabber|omen] pilot will do 15% more dps to the target than a level 2 pilot.mini | amarr | gallente get there 25% for level 5 trained hull bonus 100% of the time.cmb piltos get 25% for level 5 trained hull bonus about 30% of the time.or to put it another way averaged out over many encounters a 5% per level kin bonus is roughly equal to 1.6% per level rof | dpl.now i'm asking for 5% per level bonus for the ships mentioned in the op.a 5% per level bonus needs to be rof or dpl.are cmb's underpowered and able to absorb the added benifit without become op , yes i believe so.based on looking at ships in game allready that actually have these bonuses i dont see them being used by the player base in an dispropotionate way.in fact the rainbow missile bonused ships ( rave | sac ) arnt that popular at all."
1/13/2010,"whilst in your hypothetical here your argument is sound for the most part (begging the question and making the assertion that unkown influencing factors=no influencing factors at all are things i disagree with, though the former is the one that really irks me lol), it is a less than optimal analogy to eve, because influencing/exterior factors are both known and can be anticipated/amelliorated by strategy. again, your comment is sound on paper, but in the environment you want it to be actualised in it isnt viable without a nerf going hand in hand or a lot of rebalancing throughout all shiptypes to maintain balance. basically i cannot accept that attempting to find a theoretical balance in complete isolation from external factors is a good way to ensure balance in game.i can see where your coming from a lot more clearly now, thankyou (i was getting confused in arguing against several posts at once in honesty) but i feel my point still stands, i equally feel we wont be coming to an agreement on this matter; our viewpoints are essentially opposed on it, so im probably going to leave it here...though id like to say that if you can throw this amount of effort behind a more sympathetic attempt to boost caldari (on a ship to ship basis for example, rather than this blanket boost) i will certainly support it; or at the least be less against it in principle :)"
1/13/2010,"the thing is, you stopped debating the topic before telling us why our counter arguments are wrong. that tells me you have no response to them, nothing to say why they are wrong, so they must be right, correct? if you say no, then you have to say why, you can just say ""because"". an much as i can, i've said why i think your arguments are wrong.it seems your response to somebody who beat your argument is troll!! you""re a moron!! that doesn't make you right. that makes you look like a 5 year old who can't handle the truth. mom won't give me juice so it's temper tantrum time your inability to stay civil and debate the topic like normal human beings will hopefully let people know that your accusation of me being a troll is trying to draw the attention away from the fact i've successfully disproved or provided a counter argument to each and every one of your points. notice it's you and one other person (alt? with more fail arguments (not you, dav)) who think i'm a troll.the fact that this thread is 12 pages alone can let everybody know that the truth is not ""blatantly"" on your side, otherwise there wouldn't be so much controversy. your arrogance has absolutely nothing to do with how correct (incorrect) you are. all it does is make you look like an ignorant **** who can only see things one sided. somebody who can't realize they aren't always right. get the **** out of your ass and grow up.9/10 ...missing one point because your over-use of the troll and moron accusations gave you away."
1/13/2010,"very interesting post this, with lots of facts and opinions flying around... some bad, some good.i've decided to support this topic, based on the op's argument about dictating range versus dictating damage type.as per his example, a (caldari) missile ship may fit kinetic missiles and receive a ship-based damage bonus ontop of missile characteristics. an (amarr) laser ship may fit radio crystals and receive a range bonus (as opposed to other types of crystals), on top of applicable ship-boni (e.g. damage). that's nice, and fine, and dandy. now, they come across each other. the thoughtful amarr knew about his kinetic hole (if applicable) and has plugged it, which the caldari pilot assumes (as most players will plug substantial resist holes.)now, at this stage, the amarr pilot with radio has two choices:attempt to outrange the missiles (not likely) or switch to a short-range crystal (e.g. multifrequency) and get in range of the caldari pilot. it doesn't matter which he goes with from a ship-boni point of view, as the bonus is to the gun, not the crystal.similarly, the caldari pilot has a choice as well:hope that the amarr pilot hasn't plugged the hole well and that his kinetic missile bonus will make kinetic missiles reign above the others, or switch to another type (e.g. explosive or thermal) and hope that the amarr pilots resistance will be lower there. if he decides to switch missile he will lose his ship-bonus, in exchange for another damage type, without actually knowing how it'll compare.here, the issue arises: the amarr pilot can dictate his damage by choosing range (as lower range ammo deals more damage) while the caldari pilot can dictate his damage by choosing damage type (as different missiles deal different damage, at same range). however, the amarr pilot will receive a bonus to his damage no matter ammo, while the caldari will lose it as soon as he moves from kinetic. also, in pvp one will always know how a multifrequency compares to a radio crystal (shorter range, higher damage) while you can't tell for sure with damage types.there are certainly other ships that have issues, and other weapon systems, and other types of gameplay, and other fittings, etc etc ad infinitum. however, those arguments are irrelevant to this topic; as in, it's not relevant if armor tankers have cramped low-slots - that's another issue, and linking it to this one is a logical fallacy - even if your ships are not functioning as you think they should does not mean ours should not be allowed to function."
1/13/2010,"thanks for the detailed explanation. now, i fully understand your position and i believe that some changes may well be justified. however, we have to go through them on a ship to ship basis since some of the ships that you've listed do not require any additional buffs to their performance. of the ships that you've listed, i have only flown drakes, caracals, kestrels* and caldari navy hookbills. out of those four ships, i firmly believe that the drake does not need a power boost, but others, i have no problem with. however, i would only advocate a damage bonus, not a rof one, as the latter would increase overall dps. i can't comment on the other caldari ships because i have never flown them.edit: *i flew the other affected frigates too but i don't really give a damn to them either way."
1/13/2010,"ok one thing i don't know if it was brought up or not yet, but i just took a specific lok at the bonuses on some caldari ships, and it seems like the kinetic missile damage is often applied to every single missile size? as in you can fit undersized weapons and still get bonused? you can fit any kind of missile and get bonused?not sure if that's a big deal or not but if a thorax got a bonus to medium and light blasters it'd be really really nice. caldari can do that (worrect, or did i read the bonuses wrong?)"
1/13/2010,"this shouldn't be a problem, but i would prefer if we were to:a) apply the hull bonus to the weapon, not the ammo on cmbsb) look at the ships on a hull by hull basis and rebalance where necessary.in that order.t."
1/13/2010,"not every missile type, but it is quite a wide range. caracals for example do get a bonus to light missiles, so they can use assault launchers effectively.good point, though.t.edit. here is a bit more detail as to what gets a bonus for what. (kinetic damage bonus):kestrel - lighthawk - lightcrow - lightflycatcher - rocket, lightcaracal - light, heavy, hamdrake - heavy, hamcerberus - light, heavy, ham ?onyx - light, heavy, ham ?nighthawk - heavy"
1/13/2010,"i live in lowsec, and lowsec is fine. if they want to boost it, exploration should be the way. by boosting exploration, you would see the increased npc criminal activity, if you need the role play background. the harder plexes are hard enough, but there is too many of the weaker ones. lowsec combat plexes should equal l3-l5 missions in my opinion. the ones you can find with onboard scanner should be l3. the ones you need to scan down with probes should at least be equal to an easy l4. escalations could even be harder than l5 missions.i hear the mineral output from different ores are somewhat unbalanced. this could be looked at so lowsec ore is a bit more worth than today. but as i've understood, this is not directly a lowsec problem. more a balancing problem in general.i don't like the suggestions in the opening post. go to true lowsec, or fake nullsec, if you want. players can't hold sovereignity, and criminal faction have their own agents there. no sentry guns will bother with what you are doing. neither will concord, so no global criminal countdown or security hit.eve already has a player run underworld and black markets. if you expose it to the daylight, it will not be a underworld or black market anymore.concord provides security against crime too, not only faction navys do this, and in war times borders are well guarded by navy. makes no sense to have lowsec borders throughout empire. if anything, it should be harder to smuggle over war borders.crooked cops? no reason to implement npc's to do what players already do better."
1/13/2010,"1. i like where you're going with this, but i think sentry gun immunity would be a bit much. a more balance approach would be the pirate group that system's police are on the payroll of could be bribed from stations to end the pirates global criminal countdown early. this would allow local pirates to do their thing without waiting a full 15 minutes between attacks, act as an isk sink, and still be somewhat balanced because the pirate would be criminal'd at least as long as it takes him to dock. 2. hell yeah. with piratey lp stores and rewards too.3. a proper black market sounds like a great idea. i dislike using npc orders to fuel smuggling though. i think a better approach would be for the smuggling profession to be moving those black market or pirate lp items out of lowsec and into or through highsec. the tricky part would be developing some kind of system whereby it's hard to move these things into highsec (customs agents) but players living in highsec would still be able to use them. 4. i'd be ok with this, especially if more pirate items come through rewards. as it is now, the main way to get pirate items is by killing npc pirates and looting them, which i am sure concord doesnt mind at all. plus as i mentioned above, making them blanket illegal to use kneecaps a player driven smuggling profession5. see 3 and 46. meh7. sounds good but i think its practical application wouldnt really help.and of course a personal #8: give people a reason to go out of their way to hunt pirates. i was a lowsec resident for a long time under the anti piracy banner. all we ever got was the occasional thank you to pay for fighting pvp experts all damn day. security status gains, standing gains, bounty hunter profession implementation, etc. give the ""good guys"" a living.edit: forgot to add #8 will increase the lowsec population by having antipirate corps come back in style (more pirate opponents) and non pirate, non pirate hunter players wanting to exploit lowsec riches more chance at security (more pirate targets). it's really a win-win."
1/13/2010,"read and think before commenting. and don't pile together 2 very different posts. i have not asked to make low sec safer, i pointed out that you will get even less people there making gate camping easier. point for point:1) you want a way to disable gate guns so you can use interceptors and lock even fas jumping ships.perfect, so you make a granted thing that a large part of the haulers that today pass through low sec will avoid it. tanking a smartbomb in a blockade runner is easy. tanking a gatecamp long enough to get away when a inty has blocked your jump capability and webbed you is way harder.end result of this idea, less people will live in low sec.2) criminal agents:low sec has plenty of 4 +20 agents. so what do you want? pirate faction agents in competition with 0.0 so that you can lower 0.0 rewards (more pirate faction lp = lower value for pirate faction lp)? new pirate factions with new toys?no to both. fw is exactly new low sec faction with new toys. i don't want to see all the pve work ccp do for a year used for low sec or 0.0 damaged to favour low sec. 3) meh and mostly useless, but no problem with this.4) no. already explained why by other comments.5) ok.6) no.7) no again. you are again searching for a easy gank. and btw, you make a liar of yourself when you post this ""if you read the post, it is not about pirating you rich folk of hisec""."
1/13/2010,"i like how the guy says this....here go the hisec emo boys.. if you read the post, it is not about pirating you rich folk of hisec, its about making lowsec a better playing environment for those who want to live there. if you dont want risk, dont go to lowsec, it isnt as though hisec is small...of course it was said after his post where he wants hi sec made into little islands surrounded by lo sec. does that sound a bit contradictory to anyone else?heres the real problem with lo sec. it has nothing to do with players wanting to avoid risk, nothing to do with game rewards, mechanic, or anything of that sort.simply put- wannabe pirates camped certain chokepoints so frequently, and killed anything that passed through with no regard to if it was worth killing- that no one bothers to go through there anymore.atm you go to low sec for a few reasons.to camp a gate with friends so you remain 100% safe.to sneak through in the smallest of ship- you risk little so might as well try the shortcut.your so new you think low sec is the place to go for some pew pew.yes a few ppl prolly go to mission or run probe sites- the above stands true for the majority of visitors though."
1/13/2010,"i spend a good deal of time in low-sec and my corp flies the ""anti-pirate"" banner, though somewhat loosely. we engage reds when we can find them, but more often than not, we'll get bored after a couple hours of system jumping and not finding anyone with a low enough sec status that we'll just go ahead and lock up the first yellow we see or anyone who's corp sounds 'piratey'. other than just getting in some pvp, there's absolutely no incentive for most empire dewllers to go into low-sec. on the flip side, a lot of pvp'ers live almost entirely in high sec because it's safer and easier to war-dec in high sec so you can play station games all day and catch the occasional noob not paying attention. so, what we've got is a large number of industrialists that pretty much have to go into low-sec to do pos stuff and the pvp'ers that live almost exclusively in high-sec. does anyone else see the problem with that?give me some incentive to shoot the reds and leave everyone else alone. i'd move to low-sec permenantly if there were oportunity to make the kind of isk i make in high-sec and i'm sure others would too.what's the saying that ccp is so fond of? ""with great risk comes great reward."" i lived in 0.0 for a few weeks when i was a wee noob and i can say that a busy 0.0 is way safer than old man star on a slow day. there's the great risk, now where's my great reward?"
1/13/2010,"lol. so you're basically pirates.anyways low sec has so much potential, quite frankly it'd be nice if they did anything at all with low sec. +1 from me."
1/13/2010,"i disagree. those illegal itmes (drugs etc) should be sold somewhere to npc's for a good price. ""real"" smuggling is lacking because there is no profit. give people a ""smuggler trader"" profession with seeded buy/sell orders in lowsec and get a real ""underworld"" blackmarket going. you could even produce a ""smuggler"" class t2 ship. i would suggest the frigate class miner/trader ships (tormentor/bantam/navitas/burst) and give them bonus to agility and a special ""smuggling hold"" thats small (bonus/lvl in size) but almost immune to customs officials. make customs in high sec better at their job.edit: support but discussion also required"
1/13/2010,"low sec to low sec, npc to npc, illegal items trade with good rewards is a bad idea. it will reward people with jump freighters or even titans (read the old threads about the enriched uranium trade by bob via titan jump portal) and pump isk into the system via npc buy orders. a low sec npc to high sec npc option with some kind of special buy order (accessible with standing with the right corporation?) or something like the old agent offers (before the lp store) where they asked for drugs offering some good deal would be better; some kind of black market lp store where you can trade illegal items available only in low sec for special implants or other lp-like offers.essentially using illegal materials available in low sec like some alternate version of the tags used in some lp store offer. add some skill or ship modification to increase the chance of passing custom and you will have a new kind of tradeyou can already make more isk running mission in low sec than in high sec. risk is higher but reward is higher too.but that don't seem to be what interest you. if i read you correctly, you want a way to make isk doing pvp, right?sorry, but that is not possible without breaking the game.pvp is a negative sum game, as a group the participants in a fight finish it with less net worth than before starting it (counting insurance payout as something already owned by the payer). some player in every fight can end with more net worth if he loot the enemy wreck, but he will always loot less than the value of the items lost by the other player. changing that will remove every consequence from pvp fights, making the game some kind of fps."
1/13/2010,pvp is not an isk making endeavor- for the most part. you can make isk with ransoms and through the resale of loot. you want incentive to shoot only reds? how about the massive increase in traffic youll see? incentive enough? low sec is less safe because the inhabitants there are morons. shoot everything in sight- then wonder why no one ever goes through there.as for the risk vs reward argument- what you want a ticker? every second your in low sec you get x amount of isk? low sec missions pay more then hi sec missions. low sec probe sites are better then hi sec probe sites. what more do you want really?the only reason low sec sucks- is because the inhabitants are morons. no amount of game mechanic changes will change the fact the ppl living there are idiots who will shoot a shuttle for the lulz.
1/13/2010,removed post as i completly ****ed up the quote thingy
1/13/2010,"how about making the seeded buy orders a cosmos spawn that are fairly small and can be fulfilled quickly. basically, drug dealers needed a quick supply that is outside of their normal supply. this prevents the haulnaught make billions in one cyno thing. no? these cosmos agents could then respwn elsewhere in the region/constelation for another deal. high reward but probably high risk, passing through low sec and hi sec with valuble illegal cargo. hence my suggestion of a t2 frigate that is a smuggler."

1/13/2010,"i'm impressed with the amount of thought you put into it, but am wary what ccp will say about it."
1/13/2010,fw low sec is not that scarry ffs.and arnt these story arcs optional ?i.e. no one makes you do them.
1/13/2010,"they are not optional if you are grinding faction standings (you know so that you can then sign up and do fw) and only gallente have the ""pleasure"" of being offered them. they are very badly designed for all sorts of reasons:a) force you to go many jumps into low sec (yep pve ship through pvp pirate space)b) are fw warfare linked so take you to systems with fw pilots waiting for you toc) take people to the same few systems (because of the fw storyline link) so those gates are player pirate camped as they wait for the missions runners to appear to give easy targetsd) are way above the agent level you are running for e.g. the level 2 storylines are harder than level 4 missionse) give a crappy reward of an implant that is worth about 100k iskthese experimental missions were introduced as a surprise in dominion, with it appears little thought or understanding of the mission runner player base by the moron eve storyline board in atlanta with no testing on singularity. in the dev blog words they were really excited about these missions which shows what idiots some of the ccp developers and pve content writers have become and how little they understand or care about the pve player base.btw these storylines are going to all players so you find that you have run 16 mining or courier missions to be rewarded with one of these uber pvp combat missions as a storyline to get faction standing.so think about that - you are a pve industrialist\miner non-combat pilot and you get given one of these storylines and may be given another after another 16 missions. so non-combat pilots grinding faction are being given these uber forced fw and pvp many jumps into lo sec missions.supremely dumb.i can see pveers just grinding missions for corp standing only with one or two corps with the best lp rewards. so soon all the pve playerbase will be running for caldari navy if these missions are introduced to all faction space."
1/13/2010,"k sorry my bad, i was thinking they were some sort of new arc.being kos in gallente space i have not had the chance to try them out for myself yet.can i ask one question?do the missions require the complete destruction of all npc's in the plex like most standard level 4'sor are they more like fw missions where you only need to kill 1 structure | boss ship | or a few industrials ?if the asnwer is the second ( eg they are like fw missions ) then they can probably be completed with a stealth bomber in the same way most fw missions are done."
1/13/2010,"not optional?i was unaware there was a ccp employee standing behind you forcing you to click ""accept"".and of course only the gallente are being offered them. would you rather see them test it with the caldari instead? yeah...that would soooo work to test a system to encourage people to join in fw.instead of just ranting like a maniac and saying how you hate them, offer solutions to fix what you feel is wrong with them and still achieve the intended goal. if you can't do that, then you shouldn't be bringing up a halfased subject up that the csm can't actually do anything with when they present it to ccp other then; ""yeah, x people hate it cause of this, we dunno how they want to see it fixed."""
1/13/2010,"thanks for the hint on completing them. they do seem to be like fw missions, go into fw lo sec space and destroy base\ship which is surrounded by tough npcs as well as being fresh meat for fw pilots and pvpers.the problem is that they are storyline missions and have level 1 and 2 versions. which means that:- noobs grinding faction, with no idea of the game, and having not yet made friends or joined a corp, may get these missions as a storyline offer. - in these storylines which are fw linked only a few locations are being used, so these are now being camped by fw pilots and pirates to whack the first noob that pops through the gate.- for the noob they are very hard and give a false idea as to the purpose of storylines - hey how to keep people interested in the game.which seems dumb as these pilots will not have the right skills to fly the right ship or the appropriate game knowledge. also if you are experienced but are grinding faction on an alt to join fw, it makes it very very hard to grind up to the required faction standing for fw. also miner\courier\trading\industrialist pilots are also getting these fw pvp combat missions so will not have the skill for them however many sps they got. usually if you run non-combat missions you get non-combat storylines; to be given one of these pseudo fw nightmares (dreamed up by ****whit ccp eve employees on pharmaceuticals) is beyond belief. yep hard to believe but these new storyline missions really are that badly designed. rushed and untested. if they had gone to caldari agents i think they would have lasted until about the next downtime but us gallente are stuck with them as hapless guinea pigs.no one is doing them, they are being turned down. i mean even if you are in a corp, if you are grinding faction and doing some mission running are you really going to ask your pve corp mates ""hey guys want to come and lose your ships, waste time and be pvp easy meat by helping me do one of these really really stupid and poor new fw forced pvp storyline missions?""or would you just run another 16 missions in the same time and hope you get offered one of the old proper tried and tested storylines?in my view the eve storyline board in atlanta should be reprimanded and or sacked. whatever ways there might be to get more pveers into fw and low sec and pvp this is not one of them."
1/13/2010,"aloriana, some people are getting these 4 storylines in a row, that is after running 64 missions the only storylines they have been offered are these complete abominations of a game mechanic.some of these players are not combat players, but miners, traders and industrialists who have run courier and mining missions.it makes grinding faction very difficult and frustrating.my solution is simple, remove these badly designed experimental missions which were never tested on singularity first but which were rushed in at the back-end of dominion with little thought or even comprehension of the pve missions runner playerbase. the csm should deal with the fact that:a) such a poorly designed game mechanic was introduced with no testing or even player consultation (you know at least with the csm via focus group)b) by people who despite their title ""eve storyline board"" seem to have no idea about the role of storylines, faction standing, and the mind set of pve players who run missions and grind factionc) if this is the best that ccp employees who represent the pve side of the game can come up with to move pveers into low sec, pvp and fw then questions should be raised about ccps recruitment, management and quality assurance policies. if ccp have teams that are this poor at designing content then the csm should be asking questions.i have actually stopped grinding faction on this alt, an alt whose sole aim was to do fw once they had the standings. the opposite of what these ****whit designers wanted to achieve."
1/13/2010,"see, this is exactly what your opening post should have been instead of your current opening rant. but there are some points you must secede to because they do make sense if you look at it from a whole, beyond what you hate about it. you can't just remove them entirely because they do serve a purpose, so you need to learn to compromise.and to be honest, if they had tested them on the test server it wouldn't have gotten a fraction of the testing it's getting now, and the galente do offer the most appropriate way of testing it. they're very low on players, are losing, and this helps to funnel players in. it gives them the option and even just a small incentive to at least try it.but let's deal with your issues;first, what would you suggest they do to prevent the multiple offers in a row problem? should they program it to activate at a certain standing level? should they give you two storyline options (1 normal, 1 fw)? which type of agents should you be using for it to activate (don't just say ""combat"" since most do include combat)?second, if you think the system is entirely wrong, what would you suggest they do to achieve the same results they're trying now?third, attacking ccp employees, divisions, etc. will not garner any points when the subject is brought forward. do you believe that ccp will listen to the csm members if they present the idea and say ""nobody likes it cause your people suck and did it wrong.""?lastly, why did you stop entirely? the storyline missions have slightly more rep as a reward, but that's all. you're still getting rep for regular missions. is the potential loss of rejecting a storyline mission every x missions really that great a potential loss?"
1/13/2010,"ok:first ideas: only to people who are running combat missions and give them a choice: one of these or an ordinary storyline mission. give people a choice to be a lab rat or not, like we have the choice to be on singularity or not. this would allow people to continue to get faction standing, as storylines are still the only way of getting faction standing. on this alt i need 0.01 to join fw, and i hit this new storyline wall of crap.your second point on ideas needed. yes i should have some, but i think that on various forums players better than me have given very good ideas on improving fw, low sec and pvp. sorry but i fail here and leave this to those with more knowledge than me; i do know that what they have done is bad and is not working.your third point: my main has been in since 2003, and at times it seems that ccp and their employees seem to make huge mistakes and show very little insight at thinking consequences through. the t2 bpos seeding scandal, the boot.ini fiasco, cover-ups of gm favouritism and then inept apologies when the cover-ups are unearthed, the pos duping of t2 materials bug being in for several years without action then the cover-up and another apology over this. it just goes on.these mistakes keep happening and make ccp, frankly, look like amateurs. the lack of testing of game concepts here is shocking; the atlanta storyline team clearly got caught into some ""group think"" and thought their idea was wonderful, and vomited it into dominion as a pavement pizza of an idea. this shows poor quality assurance, poor management, and a poor understanding of the pve playerbase by people responsible for pve player content. to not even concept test this with player csm reps is astounding, to then force it on players so ineptly smacks of rank incompetence. they say they were so excited they just had to get it in there for at least one faction: they admit it was rushed and untested and yet would have given it to all factions if able. we pay monthly for this game, we have a commercial relationship with ccp, and at times they just seem to take us for granted with a haughty there it is, like it or lump it attitude. in the past this would work because of the nerdiness of game players who were delighted with the challenge. games in the fantasy genre such as vanguard, warhammer and conan have shown that paying players no longer accept bad game mechanics and bad product and will walk away.with no sci-fi competition worth a crap ccp is in a captured market position and too often they seem to exploit this dominance to their own end. too often i feel like ccp just **** all over me and expect me to be grateful.i like the game, run two accounts, keep coming back, but ccp seem to keep putting barriers up and not routes to try new things."
1/13/2010,"wrong on all accounts:1) the don't make sense as mission for people outside of fw. if you do cargo deliveries you aspect to get them to peaceful countries unless you are a contractor for the army. 2) this is the stated goal: essentially linking missions to news items, but doing that the wrong way, affecting only one faction and without any idea of some kind of falloff from them.the idea that they are there to encourage people in joining fw is a player deduction, but nothing support that.the ""purpose"" seem to be that it is cool to have a mission linked to a news item. so when we will get a mission to bring ships to a alliance during a war? it would be wonderful to have a mission that require you to bring ships to the stations of the it alliance or to their enemies. it will mesh wonderfully with eve evolving story. while i agree that testing them on the sis server would have been almost useless (no pirates, no attacks by other players without consent, low population) testing them on the gallente is the wrong idea exactly for the reasons you list. they are low on fw players and this kind of mission will not encourage players to join fw (being slaughtered by the enemy militia and pirates while you learn the ropes is the wrong way to incentive people to join);they are losing and adding even more losses to people getting gallente standing will not encourage people to run for gallente;for the above reasons this kind of missions don't help funneling players to fw. it teach you very early that caldari npc ships use ecm and that you have no way to counter that (eccm don't work on npc), that missiles hit very well in pve while guns work fairly badly, so what they teach is that going against caldari npc in low sec is the worst way to go in low sec and that it is best to avoid joining the gallente militia as the npc you will meet are the worst to meet while risking pvp (try doing pvp while the npc use ecm on you). ."
1/13/2010,"only fw agents should offer them to fw players. unless i am a military contractor i don't want to get delivery contracts for military bases in the middle of afghanistan.as the sated goal is to link long standing new items with missions ccp can chose less constricting new (only a few target system, only a race affected) or macke them epic story arcs. agreed. yes. it is a faction gain that you get every 16 missions. refusing it hurts. btw, a comment i just got from corpchat from a caldari character with very bad gallente standing trying to correct it:> and my plan to work for quafe in annaro is a bust. > out of 4 storyline missions i got, three of them were low sec, 21 jumps away, half of which through gallente high sec, to kill caldari.> i've wasted a better part of a week trying that instead of making my usual income."
1/13/2010,"the reason for not allowing a pc version is simple; no cannabalization of their market share. mmo players are relatively stable in numbers. ask most people, they at some point or another have played an mmo. true ""new"" players are rare. therefor, to get players, you are required to get them from somewhere else (read: another game). by releasing dust on the pc, ccp would be forfeiting some amount of eve membership to those who are more interested in an fps style game. by only putting it on a different platform (consoles), they minimalize their risk of that.hence, overall it is more profitable to ccp to seperate the markets for dust and eve, and more profit means more developement and better games. or at least more eye candy. therefor i do not support this."
1/13/2010,thats very true dek kato but the other side of the coin is that eve has created a loyal fan base before the game is relesed so it would be purchsed by a large number of people that can not get it on console.by and large if your reading this you have made a choice of pc over console. ccp has made a choice of securing there new income stream over serviceing there customers. if they decide they dont want take my money for eve and dust then my money will do the talking as it walks over and gets mass effect 2 or some other game.
1/13/2010,"good discussion, i post some my ideas as well in original thread."
1/13/2010,and there is room for a lot more as well. good mechanics would only help entice more into it.
1/13/2010,"i support this. as it stands now plexing only benefits the individual through standing. the npc's need to be toned down a bit in terms of ewar so they don't dismotivate ( ie play a smaller role in the outcome of) player vs player combat inside a plex at the very least. there needs to be some sort of reward beyond standing for plexing (lp, isk, you name it). also system ocupancy should mean something beyond occupying a system for giggles and bragging rights. the concept of plexes was a very nice idea. it would promote combat between simillar types of ships, something that caught the eye of a poor/new-ish player such as myself."
1/13/2010,"agreed, although this:sounds way too easy to exploit."
1/13/2010,- remove 3 of the launcher fittings.- add 2 turret fittings.- add 8 power grid.- change interdictors skill bonus from 5% to rocket and light missile thermal damage to 5% to small hybrid turrest.
1/13/2010,"the same goes for the heretic. why they went from bad-ass gun-toting destroyer to meh-missile/rocket spewer is beyond me.kind of makes sense for caldari, but amarr/gallente bubblers were shafted rather well"
1/13/2010,having the t1 caldari destroyer be a missile platform would be nice too
1/13/2010,"having a second destroyer for each race, with the caldari one being a missile one, would be even nicer. however, since that isn't going to happen, i'll settle for making the eris not suck."
1/13/2010,double post ftw?
1/13/2010,this ship needs love bad.
1/13/2010,"ah ... yes, i hardly ever got insurance payouts, i mainly remember to pay for it the odd time actually insured a ship. but i stay corrected.however (and i did not read this thread, so this was probably mentioned already at some place here) it would be interesting to have some data about insurance premiums paid and insurance payouts handed out. maybe it is not that big a fountain? but i don't know ...nevertheless, insurance need to be reworked or even better removed."
1/13/2010,"minor point, but insurance does have the capability of acting as a sink.in theory, if someone buys a ship, purchases insurance, and then doesn't lose the ship....isk is removed from the system. as the % of insurance 'policies expired' approaches 100, insurance is an isk sink.but yeah, in reality, it generally acts as a faucet, as lots of ships tend to explode.and right now, its a firehose of isk. people are actually purchasing insurance for the express reason of self-destructing for profit, meaning the % of 'policies expired' is approaching 0%, and the number of policies taken out is skyrocketing, too boot.its a big problem, and sadly, it seems beyond most eve forum denizens' comprehension."
1/13/2010,"the insurance system has been showing it's age for awhile now. it is overly simplistic, and is not robust enough in an ever-changing market. simply put, we need something that doesn't seem to have an infinite supply of money and resources.edit: forgot to support."
1/13/2010,fully endorsed.
1/13/2010,yes.
1/13/2010,"in the early days there used to be missions that turned slaves into scientists, caretakers etc. there could be a round robin loop of missions, that convert one type of person into another with different results depending on the faction. it might be good to make these the fw equivalent of the faction standing missions.something along these lines.minmatar. slaves -> freed slaves -> freedom fighters amarr/caldari marines -> powgallente slaves -> freed slaves -> marines caldari/amarr marines -> pow amarr freedom fighters/marines/tourists -> pow -> slavescaldari gallente/minmatar marines -> pow -> forced labourthe gaps would need to be filled in to account for all the various types of people under passengers.finally you could have missions to recover your sides pow from enemy fw complexes.deliver pow to your faction navy for a reward like with tags.if this is added i think it should be done in a way that enriches fw.-- edited --i also like this mechanic variation of the same idea."

1/13/2010,"can you elucidate by providing a sample scenario in which a pc infected with malware can provide the attacker with the appropriate information with which to steal that account?making an authenticator mandatory (as blizzard is proposing for world of warcraft) means that the people who aren't paranoid enough to use strong passwords and common sense, will also be protected.the user is the weakest link in the security chain. an authenticator removes that link, leaving a strong chain.unless the user also registers the nigerian prince's authenticator on their account, there's nothing the nigerian prince can do with the information.an authenticator does not add that much effort. just type in the number. the authenticator is separate to your pc, so it is immune to malware attacks against the pc. it is immune to spyware you inadvertently load on your pc with your sony music products or microsoft technology demonstrators, for example."
1/13/2010,"another thing to note is that the npc seeded items have another effect on the economy. they force 0.0 alliances to be dependent upon logistical lines to/from empire. currently, 0.0 alliances need to go back to empire in order to get pos fuel and pos mods/towers. if you were to remove this npc seeding and made bpos for these items available, then it would be possible for a 0.0 alliance to be 100% self-sufficient in 0.0 space, never needing any resources from empire (which could be a bad, or a good thing).not supporting though because of the isk sink."
1/13/2010,"this is a really simplistic way to put it but you cannot arbitrarily remove isk sinks as there is no government controlling the amount of isk in circulation. and, in eve, there can't ever be. there's no way to collect on defaulted loans so there's no way to introduce more money into the system except for isk faucets. unless we want to see a completely runaway economy your proposal, as is at least, won't work. you have to come up with a way to make the money leave the system again as there's no government to throw it in an incinerator."
1/13/2010,"supported, at least for bpc's. this game excels and is built around the players there is no more reason fundemental equipment like this should be npc produced anymore then bs's should be npc produced. other isk sinks will have to be found (could just remove insurance v0v that'd be a big help), but that shouldn't be something keeping an out of place implementation where it doesn't belong.put them in exploration sites in low sec or below. missioning really doesn't need anymore boosts then it already has."

1/13/2010,why? because a single right click is too straining? there are other far more important issues that need to be dealt with.
1/13/2010,"i think the only real reason anyone wants this is because they hate the fact that they go into a system and right away their target warps to a safe spot or docks up. now they lose their killmail. personally in respect to the lore of the game, the jumpgates you use to get to a system keeps a record of the pilot and sends the information accordingly. just because pilots have gotten smarter and its harder for you to go after your target, you want to overhaul a system. first aspect they have to be paying attention to local. then this is where you suggest that everyone pay attention to local or that its stupid not to. well those stupid people pay the price after losing their ships. if not using local then how about a system that links up the pilot with a stargate letting them see the last people who used it to enter and leave and uploads it to local? in all actuality i've never been a fan of if you use the gates then you don't appear in local. the whole *talking* is useless since no one really says anything in local except people who need their epeen tickled. local will be what it is in wh, dead, no one ever talks in local unless they want to die. i am a fan of if you use your jump bridge then you should not appear in local since you used an alternative motive to enter the system that is not recorded by the jumpgate system.however what you suggesting is to make it easier for pirates to kill people and to set up traps, since everyone has gotten pretty smart about travel in low sec and 0.0.if you take out the local system then you have to give everyone an alternative motive that works just as well and letting everyone know who just entered the system. since this goes against what your actualy motive of staying completely hidden to get the drop, its not going to work. i'm really sleepy i hope all that i said made sense. don't know why i post when i'm about to go to sleep. thats my 2 cents"
1/13/2010,"i like the idea of delayed local, or a local that can be turned off, i posted in this idea a while ago, it was fun and tbh something i would love to see happen, i would be intrested in seeing what the op thinks about it, or anyone else in here.mean while i support this idea, provided a tool for gathering intel is put in place, maybe a local scanner that always displays how many people are in system, or switching local for constellation chat. tbh i would rather see the idea in this link happen, but overall, local being removed as an intel tool would be a good thing.edit: tbh, its not always about the next kill mail, sure some want it for that, others want it so there is more to warfare then seeing 80 in local and knowing you need to bring at least 90 of your own to win."
1/13/2010,"the game mechanics r already heavily in favor of the attacker. removing local would only make it worse 'cause the attackers will simply assume that there r targets in every system and once they scan u down, u're dead because u won't know they're there but they know u're there. as a result, this will only backfire when no one without an entire army watching their back will go into low sec or 0.0. then all the gankers will be left with r other gankers to gank. avoiding the last scenario is probably the only reason removing local was suggested but once again, it won't work.as for the 90 to kill 80 issue, local's not the problem. the game mechanics r set up to heavily favor strength in numbers--that's why ppl blob and out-blob other blobs if they have the numbers for it."
1/13/2010,"you obviously aren't in 0.0... 85% of the systems are empty. of the 15% that aren't, 10% of those have 1-4 people afk at a pos. 4% are in station systems, docked and afk.1% are actually out, doing something.i can take your scenario, and say this: attacker goes system to system, finding nothing. after 2 hours they finally spot you and your friends. however you see them coming in on your scanner and warp off.either way, if you are wise you live."
1/13/2010,"only u're not taking a tour of every single 0.0 system in the universe so who's gonna say the system u're going to isn't infested by pirates? u're sure as hell not gonna find out til it's too late. sure u can see them coming in on your scanner...if they're 14 au or closer while their scan probes scout the entire system and u mash that scan button every single second. and by the time u spot an interceptor hit ""hit warp to 0"" once while u spam ""scan"", ""scan"", ""scan"" over 9000 times, u have... what... up to 3-5 seconds to escape before u get tackled? now how i'm not describing 0.0? why don't u try running that scenario first? it's a lot more common."
1/13/2010,"i do.. in w-space. all the time. had a couple drakes get away from our small gang just the other night.see, you are one of those that uses local for intel and a warning when to run away. you give the impression that you want to hide from reds, not actually counter them.that will remain the difference. you're prey. you will fight anything that scares you or enhances the unknown. you fear uncertanty."
1/13/2010,"i can agree that we need a better way to see enemys coming in, boost the d-scanner range, or something else that allow sov holders to know how many people are in system, but not who is in system. this could be a new reason to reintroduce the system scanner array's for pos's. what idea's would you have to improve the idea of removing local, or setting it in a delayed mode? do you think the idea as a whole is bad or just the lack of intel for the defending side? have you considered that the enemy's will be risking just as much if there happens to be a fleet waiting for them? do you think the enemy not knowing if you are there can be an effective defense for ratters and miners?"
1/13/2010,1. even with no local u couldn't catch them? that's your fault then.2. how exactly does countering reds work when u're in a pve ship?3. must be real scary and uncertain for u to scan down the whole system and know exactly who and how many is in the system.4. sounds like u just want easier kills like the others 'cause u couldn't even catch 1 of those 2 battlecruisers with no local assisting them.
1/13/2010,"1. the idea of a delayed local is all the time they need to bubble the gates by the time u notice them or at least jump in, quick scan, jump out.2. have u considered that the enemy is pvp fit and will be a lot more prepared to fight/run from enemy fleets than a ratter in a pve fit? not much risk when there's covert ops scouts scanning for all the intel that's needed and interceptor tacklers able to gauge the situation firsthand and retreat if it's not favorable.3. the enemy will still know via scan probes. local is not the only way a pirate will know a target's present. do u ever mention that?"
1/13/2010,"i might not get this thing right.are you referring to""lag""as in ""latency"",or to lag as in""low frames per second""?lag is an old term that illiterate and ignorant kids have started misusing in place of jitter, for example.again, lag equals latency in the well established network jargon of computer science.which one are you referring to, pharon?"
1/13/2010,"considering that, from a server standpoint, activating a module is probably something like:[gigar] activated group of 8x 425mm railgun i's on <target>compressed:gigar; activated; 8g 425mm railgun i; <target>i'm not network engineer, but i'm pretty sure that there's not really anything you can do in this part."
1/13/2010,"and then ofcourse sending all that information to everyone on the grid. witch could be skipped imo. fact is if you have 2 players on the field every event that would generate an effect would be sent to eachother. so server will have to send 2 packets. if you have 100 players there will be 100x100 packets as every move that generates a graph update will be sent to all of the players. fact is that things grow exponentially , not linear. ofc, what i'v done is maybe the simpliest possible model. but it should give an ideea. might worth investigating."
1/13/2010,"you are correct in the conclusion that the algorithmic complexity scales exponentially with player count (nxn). yet your proposal is assuming that sending the data to all involved parties on a grid is a main bottleneck. while that process takes some computational resources, the main computational load and the one responsible for lag is simply running the simulation for all objects/entities in a system. even if you stop sending the data to the clients, the server still has to compute the whole simulation, so little is gained.and finally, the way the simulation engine works makes your proposal impossible:the server runs the simulation for the whole system, while the client only simulates the subset also known as the ""grid"". the engine is deterministic and assumes that both server and client will result in the exact same simulation. remember the devblog explaining desync? desync is what happens when server and client reach different results in the simulation (because of a bug, for instance). now if you stop sending vital simulation info to the client, it cannot even get the same result, which contradicts the simulation engine concept.and like pointed out, turning off effects only reduces the stress on the client ofc.also, you might be interested in reading my little analysis on the lag problem: discussion on fighting lag"
1/13/2010,"first of all, some data are essential , as where are the ships headed if they enter warp state or not or if they get destroyed , when they enter the grid and from what direction, your level of hp (i-ll just call it hp) current target(s) or ppl in watchlist level of hp. as far as let's say all the participants level of hp i'm shure they update dinamically when requested (ie when you actually target someone). the information determining an effect of pew pew between third party and third party on my client does not seem to be vital in regarding to maintaining sync, as all the information will readibly available when actually necesary.i do not make the asumption that comunication betwen server and client regarding effects is a main bottleneck, but it shure does hav an impact on performance. i do however make the asumption that most pilots engaged in large scale combat turn off mos of their effect for fps ( uaually called client side lag but technically it's fps) so if that's true, if if cutting it off from the server helps even in a few percent improvement why not having it cut off from server ?beeing what it is an nxn function , computational resources will easily dry out no matter of given hardware, as in a year maybe from now we'll have probably 1000 to 1000 fights. reducing complexity by cutting off some of the less vital functions is one way to deal wit it.paralelising operations comes in mind as you outlined but that opens a whole new pandora box regarding desync, bugs and exploits as it happens with all current modern-day os kernels.p.s. i'm now in process of reading all developer blogs that could be related and help me understand more of the internals. still its a tedious task, if anyone can point into the one that adresses those issues i'd appreciate."
1/13/2010,"the difference in computational load for sending a message meaning ""you lost 100hp"" to sending one meaning ""player b hit you for 100hp"" is minimal. and that message is enough for the client to trigger a visual effect. missls and drones are different, but you get the point.and who decides when a fleet is ""big"" and the measures should be applied? what if the effects are crucial for determining the best course of action in a fleet battle? correct.no, if the function wasn't ""vital"" it wouldn't have been introduced in the first place. divide and conquer to manage complexity.threading isn't generally the cause of exploits. but sure, the increased performance threading can bring comes at a cost (code complexity, qa, etc.). if you can guarantee that the result of your multithreaded code is deterministic, no new desync issues are introduced.this one is quite interesting: on desyncand a general collection of links to different technology blogs: updates"
1/13/2010,"true but i wasnt refering to that. as it is now you are geeting a message that player c is shooting at player d with is generating an effect of lazorz from player c to player d. you are not targeting either of them, and neither of them are in watch list. so what do we care ?server load. after a certain threshold it should go that way. i'm shure that in fights with 1 ... 2+ minutes module lag, tactical decisions are much more less if not at all taken upon effects. having them all enabled on any but the top line computers is already making the game mostly unplayable. trying to figure witch of the 300 enemy dots is shooting what (or for that matter repearing or having a sensor booster activated ) and taking decisions based on that dosent seem reasonable to me. what's true for small scale isnt for large scale and vice versa. if lag wouldnt be a problem and we'd all use alienware computers effects might be more tan just eyecandy in large scale but as it is now lag is the worst problem. btw i have yet to come across an alliance that would instruct their members to have effects , turrets & missile effects on during large fleets. if any of those exists i'd like to know. but as currently is fleet standatd set-up is to shut them off. no , it's never. bad programing is source of bugs and bugs are source of exploits. still introducing the complexity paralelising would mean we are to be expected to have alot of bugs. i'm shure ccp have excelent programmers but as with all the software industry they do have timelines, deadlines, and not enough or not up-to scale testing. thanx for the links ;)"
1/13/2010,"the thing is probably you client need to know who fired on you anyway, because you hp has to decrease. yes, sure, get rid of sensor boosters and stuff if it does not effect the battle itself under conitions when a node is strained."
1/13/2010,"i too support ramblings that may or may not have any grain of truth in them. because i am computer god and know everything about every system in the world.why hasnt anyone told ccp about lag yet? im sure it can be fixed by three button pushes. why wont they push the three buttons to fix it!serious thought- dont you think ccp is aware of lag? they have some top end hardware- its not like the jury rigged a bunch of old apple 2's together. maybe the problem is that eve is an evolving piece of code- one of the most ambitious projects marketed. hmmm, maybe?"
1/13/2010,i'm feeling deeply sorry if my post has overwhelmed your cognitive capacities. for the future if the node that runs your brain is overloaded it would be better just to refrain from posting. you are just making a fool out of yourself.tl;dr go away. you are a bad troll that is trolling bad.
1/13/2010,"this is the nth time that one dimwit, or one of his many boyfriends, derailed this thread with a pointless, useless and plain ****** accusation of trolling.it's obvious that you people don't play pve, you don't play eve for the pve side of it... but why don't you ask ccphow manyof the playerbase do so?oh and another thing,do you ""think"" (for what a brick can think of course) that the game would even crawl without carebears?what i propose is perfectly sound, it's not game breaking and is useful for polishing one aspect of the game that is annoying and unnecessary.oh and one last thing, these ""trolling"", ""tears"" things that you metrosexual kids so much love, they belong to your generation, who obviously likes rambling and ranting on the forums more than playing.i instead have an obligation to stick around since i brought the point forward, which is right and just."
1/13/2010,"you still didnt get it. instead of answering the arguments of the other posters you attack people. and then wonder why nobody is going to support your proposal. amazing.""my proposal is the best and everyone, who doesnt agree is a d*mb*ss and doesnt have a clue"" right?that is going to work. with your attitude people even got discourage to tell you that ccp fixed some of your issues already, but i wont tell you which either. do your research maybe you will find it.so i guess i will be attacked next but i guess you will enjoy it again! bye."
1/13/2010,"it's honestly and truly and sincerely not my fault if you're not the brightest of the bunch, and not my fault too that your head is so much up your bum that you don't see the stupidity that permeates peoples replies here, comprised your own.i already clearly and thoroughly explained why and how this very sound problem about annoyment, grief and loss of time repelled five real life friends of mine from the game.but perhaps my fault is in thinking that you (as in crazed lot of monkeys doing the keyboard doodie/ enter key smash in this thread)might have real life friends that you'd like playing the game?to summarise, if five people were discouraged by the warpgate/ mwd/ graphical problems, per one (me) player... how many total individuals have not stuck to the game overall because of the same issues?like leashed horses, you don't see the big picture, but i do: the reply isa lot.so, since i already wrote a complete explanation and workaround, but you didn't get it, here it is again:and stop whining like a child about the fact that i don't tolerate stupidity and imbecility. you know that at least the graphical proposal is worth of approval, and if you people had the least of courage, you'd approve it, even despite the fact that you don't like the original poster."
1/13/2010,i am sorry to inform you that i dont like your ideas. has nothing to do with you.
1/13/2010,"i don't tolerate stupidity and imbecility, and your proposal has no value for those of us smart enough never needing to warp out and back into a mission pocket. i can only see the need in case you are one of those losers who have to frequently run like a chicken because you didn't plan well before going into the heat of battle.or if you have frequent disconnects, which i never have, so there must be something wrong with your pc or internet service provider, and in both cases you're stupid for not taking care of the problem yourself.a third possibility could be that you are horrible at planning your time and end up having to leave a mission before it is completed. again a case of your own lack of ability.in fact, think of the long slow traveling time you must endure, crossing an empty deadspace pocket you have already cleared, as the punishment you must receive due to your intellectual deficiencies. we don't reward idiotic behavior around here. no sir."
1/13/2010,supported.marauders and orcas are special ships no dedicated salvager.
1/13/2010,"seems a little complex. wouldn't the following be easier.1. bounty held in escrow. bounty paid as a percentage of the value of the destroyed ship or a client set amount per ship type. the second would be to close a loophole i think i see in your proposal where t2 ships become safer for bountied individuals to fly.2. bounty on podkills based on implant costs. 3. blacklists on a contract, to include corps and alliances. the client can determine specific people or organizations who cannot take the bounty contract, to include npc corp characters.4. system specific bounties? just for funsies. ""i've got a bounty on my head in 9 systems"". maybe some utility too for carebears who want to bounty known gankers/ninja salvagers in their area.5. autoforwarding of killmails to the client. that way if he sees the mail is bs he can flag the shooter for no further payouts.just some ideas."
1/13/2010,how about this:if the pilot has bounty he can be attacked by anyone in hisec :)
1/13/2010,"as we all know, the problem is the abuse. blacklisted corporations, alliances or pilots would not help with it, because within a few minutes everyone can create an alt, put in wherever he wants, and do the deed.my proposal to have a hefty skill requirement to be able to accept bounty contracts might make that a bit more difficult, though, because with this it is not done with just a few days of training. but every serious pirate would then have a trained bounty hunter to collect the bounties on him within an npc corporation.the mechanic, that the acceptance of a contract by a bounty hunter needs to be confirmed by the contract issuer, would not eliminate that risk, but would limit it: once known, a rogue bounty hunter would not be able to get another contract, and weeks of training would be wasted on a then mostly useless character."
1/13/2010,"would not change the present system: as soon as a bounty is issued, fly to a slow high-sec system and get killed by the own alt or a friend."

1/13/2010,"currently, if you have a skill in training, you can queue up unrelated skills, no problemhowever, if you have a skill in training that is a prereq. for another skill, the follow-on skill can not be added to the queue (because it can't even be ""injected""). i propose changing the ""inject skill"" routine by removing the check to see if you are eligible to train the skill...just do not let a person actually train the skill til the prereq is met (allow the follow-on skill to be added to the queue, after the last prereq)as it stands now, whenever i have a skill that has a prereq. i have to wait til the entire skill queue is drained, then add the follow-on...."
1/13/2010,sounds good and can't hurt anyone either.
1/13/2010,"upported. but depending on how eve is coded, this might not be realizable."
1/13/2010,i've requested this on a number of occasions and it did make it past csm's little gauntlet but no word on whether it passed or not.
1/13/2010,"i'll support this.if the system is looking at our attributes and such to calculate training time (which i can only assume it as as opening the training window and/or editing the queue seems to always take some time), why can't there be a check for prerequisites being in queue when adding a skill (or removing one). the skills that require a prerequisite already in queue could be highlighted somehow to emphasize them."
1/13/2010,"supported, again."
1/13/2010,hopefully this is as simple as it sounds within the coding.supported.
1/13/2010,i laugh just a little bit harder when a killmail has expensive books destroyed on it.so not supported.
1/13/2010,"i am against this idea solely on the grounds that your proposed idea would completely remove the need for a person to go and spend time planning their queue, when they'll buy books, etc.with your suggestion, i would be able to buy every skillbook there is, inject every single one of them, and then train them once i qualify.even if you limit it to ""inject skills with prereqs being trained"" i could easily buy 5 books requiring one skill, and then inject them all, then say 'screw it' and change my queue to something else entirely. and this doesn't even consider if the prereq skill in queue would be required to be the level or the skill alone.we have a 24h queue, can we not just be happy we have it? or would you rather go back to no injecting at all, and 0 queue at all?"
1/13/2010,do people ever think before they post?or is that read?
1/13/2010,"did you?my previous concerns and stance on the subject is based on the exact proposal and look beyond what it does immediately, but also how it'll impact other things."
1/13/2010,"ok--then it'll check to see if the skill still requires a prerequisite and if part of the queue gets cancelled, everything that won't be valid afterwards will be gone, like if someone tried to delete weapon upgrades lvl 5 before the injection of advanced weapon upgrades. minor tweak and it's good, no big deal.why do ppl want to nerf the queue so badly?"
1/13/2010,"because their are underlying issues. :)let's take your suggested solution. you just cancelled an entire queue included prerequisites and an inject skill using the original idea. what happens to the injected skill you no longer qualify for?-is it removed, completely destroyed and you've now lost the isk for the book?-is it removed, a book created for the skill appearing in your inventory? ship or station?--what if your inventory is full when this happens, is the book never created at all?--how would you prevent this from being used by people who can now transport books across the galaxy without fear of loosing them?and if you say 'no, you just keep it' either based on the fact you were previously training a prerequisite then stopped or because of the suggested change, you've still got:-people loading a prereq skill, inject 5+ books, then cancel and keep skill.-people buying all skills they can afford, inject them, and never worry about having to fetch books, transporting them until they can learn them, etc.and if you say 'then you can't delete prereq skills and injected from the queue' you end up with:-people who may make a mistake and cannot change their queueit's not ""nerfing"" the queue. nerfing implies making it worst, you are talking about buffing it. talking about not buffing it is not the same as nerfing. now, if i said just take away injecting, that's a nerf. cutting it down to 12 hours, that's a nerf. arguing for not buffing something is not a cry for nerfing.so, i'm sorry, but as it stands i still cannot support the idea for buffing something which doesn't need a buff. compare what we have now with what we had before and tell me if it still needs more buffing. and no, ""it's more convenient"" is not a good enough reason or we'd have had the training queue years ago."
1/13/2010,definitely would like this to happen. there have been quite a few time where i would have made use of it instead of being forced to cue up another less pressing skill and leave it till i got back.it ads functionality to the design and takes nothing away.
1/13/2010,"the actual injection will not occur until the queue reaches the point where it's supposed to be injected, which means if it's cancelled, it will never reach the point of injection. when it does reach the point of injection, it will check to see if u have the book in one of your ship's cargo hold or station hangar. if not, it will not inject and the queue will pause. no exploit, no being stuck on a queuing mistake. we're not trying to do this as an exploit. we're trying to do this as a convenience. it's exactly like injecting them manually when when the time comes only u don't have to log on when u're not able to at the time to do so. that's talking about nerfing. might wanna replay that explanation to yourself.so what other reason do u have to not buff queuing? does it hurt u in any way?"
1/13/2010,supported.if you inject a skillbook and then don't train the prereq's then just make it so that the injected skill won't train until they are met.
1/13/2010,"support it. especially when i see what damage those ""raven-torpedoes"" do.but why need hardwiring implants need fixed slots? why cant they be neutral? an implant at the wrong place doesnt bring any use."

1/13/2010,"if you can 'steal' the wrecks without concord interference you should just be able to steal the cans too, it's a completely artificial definition on the part of ccp. the ""loot"" in the cans is stuff you managed to ""salvage"" from the destroyed ship. its amusing to me that concord would consider you a criminal for taking 100 ammo that was sitting in a broken rail gun, but be completely okay with your snatching the broken rail gun itself to sell. not supported, but my point stands."
1/13/2010,"ty for all the responses everyone has been giving me to my post! i've seen several good ideas/point, yet i've also seen several bad ones.first off: all drones are governed by the drone skill et; why would anyone think that a salvager drone wouldnt be governed by the same skill set?for example: the 'drones' skill would naturally govern how many salvager drones would b able to be implimented; the same for any other kind of drone.the 'drone interfacing' skill could have a patch on it increasing the percentage of sucessfully salvaging (since it has the percentages for mining and damage increase. (or make a ""drone salvaging"" skill to specifically govern the chance to sucessfully salvage, as has been done for mining drones with the mining drone operation skill)the scout drone operation skill governs the range of that particular ""class"" of drone. a similar skill can be created to govern the range of a salvager dronethe point is, throwing an idea out on how to make a salvager drone work isnt going to solve anything. there has to be some semblence of check-and-balance to the whole thing..."
1/13/2010,"somebody wrote a lot of technical stuff about entitys and children in the backseat further up. what if salvager drones instead of having their own cargohold just jetison everything immediately? then you can use tractor beam to get it into your cargo. would the salvager drone still go ""are we there yet""?"
1/13/2010,"i'm not sure if i'm remembering this right....but i recall a dev saying that they didn't want us to have salvage drones because salvaging should be something that you have to consciously think about doing and chose to do; and, they didn't want salvaging to be an automated task."

1/13/2010,"the problem with fw is that people don't live in the space they control and their is no leadership, the plexing mechanic doesn't support fleets or commitment, and most importantly the money making mechanic is both unsafe and isn't tied to the territory holding mechanic.1. there needs to be a way to create an offical coalition between corporation (ie an alliance) to create a large community with a clear leadership strucute to with the mindset of controlling territory.2. taking dungeons can often be done with few people, allowing one person or a small group to take an entire system. an inty for example can often fly much faster than the weapons of the npcs can hit them, meaning one person can fly around the beacon forever with little danger. instead the beacons should probably be changed so that its health has to be taken to zero and with a reinforce timer and possible all beacons have to be captured in x amount of time. 3. the top issue with fw is that conquering territory has little to do with who lives in the territory and how those who live there make their money. in 0.0 alliances are often fighting for resources, such as belts, moons, rats, etc. and have to live in those areas to make sure they have quick access to it. in fw conquering a territory doesn't provide them resources or control. the militia can't prevent enemy milita from using the stations and controlling the moons doesn't mean much and the rats and belts are all that great either. therefore a militia needs access to new valuable resources by conquering territory so that they ahve both reason to defend, conquer and populate their systems."
1/13/2010,"clearly this is a nuanced and enlightened view that you have come to after great amounts of effort. there is a lot of interest in fw, from those within as well as from those without who open up threads every week asking how fw is. the sheer amounts of threads on the subject of flawed fw mechanics is enough to belie your trite, and pointless statement.anyways threads dealing with fw here: linky, and here, and here."

1/13/2010,"obviously this is mainly for those fleet fights going over 1000 pilots in one place. right now (by what i understand from what i read) is that they can migrate resources so one system can get its own node to help fight off the lag, while other nodes might have 6-10 system in them since they aren't as active. since fleet fights are getting so bad that one node for a single system isn't enough. why not change the node structure completely? you could make it so one spot at system would have its own node since fleet battles are usually all over the system it should make fleet fights more bearable with less lag spikes or complete disconnection.tldr: make nodes for spaces inside the system instead of one for the whole system.edited2: me made an error..again"
1/13/2010,they dont even have multi threaded node code nor dynamic redistribution of nodes (reinforcing is done at downtime) and you expect something advanced like that to work?anyway. grids are instanced dynamically all over the place. its not like they are spawned statically. so you cant have one server per grid. lets assume they are spawned upfront and shared among multiple servers. the amount of needed hardware would be not feasible.
1/13/2010,"the ""grid"" is a per client concept, the node always computes the simulation for a whole system. the computational model isn't anywhere near the granularity you are suggesting.also, you might be interested in reading my little analysis on the lag problem: discussion on fighting lag"
1/13/2010,officially not supporting this year old piece of failure. eve allows you to have multiple characters on your account and unlike other mmo's it isn't to experience part of the game one of them cannot due to their race/class etc as any character can train any skill in eve. that makes people run around in alts doing all the things they don't want associated with their 'real' character/corp changing names would make that worse.

1/13/2010,"since we have the ability allow alliance members the ability to anchor, unanchor, online, and offline any type of module on our towers, is it really that hard to add the ability to allow alliance members to man starbase guns? seriously, how was this glossed over and still has not been attended to by the devs? just a simple checkbox under the defense tab or a role-based list (similar to other structure actions) would solve this nightmarish problem."
1/13/2010,"upon switching to page 2, i found this"
1/13/2010,"so there i was...i come up to the sobaseki in my bantam, half~full of salvage!i warp in and see a yellow wreck with a full hold. i open it up, and see: ""combat accessories"" i go to loot them, and bam!!! im pod'd!!!i limp into the station, and wonder what happened. after a few moments of calming down, i gather all the materiel needed to manufacture a new bantam, and throw it all into my kestrel.i undock, and no sooner am i out of the station...bam!!! bam!!! pod'd!!so i limp to another station, and get an ibis (the defaulted rookie ship for caldari) and get the salvager i that i had bought while gathering the materiel to reconstruct my (now) lost bantam..i come back to the station with the salvager on the ibis, and there's a bs lurking outside the station, destroying concord and taking pot~shots at pcs. i ask for my stuff back, and the bs says: ""here, catch!!!"" and tosses me a yellow cargo container with my original salvager i, and the 3 expanded cargohold iis that were on my original bantam.i start to loot this cargo container, thinking this nice guy isnt going to kill me if i loot it, cuz of him handing it too me, and bam!!! there goes the ibis!!!the point of this is....i propose that the aggression counter cease after the first podding, and not run a whole 15 minutes, and the offended pc be allowed to pod people the whole 15 minutes (per offense)"
1/13/2010,"um.right, so...i'm going to assume this is a troll for the following reasons:1. you don't tank or destroy concord> no one does. their entire purpose is to wtfbbqpwn you and they are very good at it.2. people in a .08 system do not take pot shots at other people unless said other people have done something stupid - like you did when you looted a yellow wreck. and took from a cargo container that wasn't yours.seriously. the aggression counter is working as intended. you just need to learn how what that means."
1/13/2010,"i myself have really always hated killmails. they aren't really accurate and people can mess with it a lot. so in turn it just becomes something for another person to gain without any real substance to the game. people should have proof of a kill though. in times when japan was in great war, to get paid soldiers were told to bring the heads of the people they killed to get paid. it was exploited by people coming in and taking off the heads of the ones who were left. however, this can't really happen here all too much since people really want that head. pirates want a juicy kill mail. the fact that there is someone wanting a way to seal the deal on it is proof enough as it is. i for one would suggest making podding easier without the huge risk to sp loss factor. this way your proof is the closet full of dead bodies you have piled up in your room. again killmails can be false and messed with to either make someone looks stronger or weaker then they really are. however, having the corpse of a known pirate who is really good at what they do says something doesnt it? i don't know just my idea really. this way you get rid of the kill-mail junkies since if they kill someone who really doesn't have a name then no one really cares and its not just a number anymore its not how many kills but essentially who you kill. my 2 cents anyways*edit* but then comes in the problem on how to become famous since the whole bounty system is ****ed up. oh well...again 2 cents"
1/13/2010,re-read what i said as a suggestion.we do not need a new ship.we have a perfectly balanced and mighty fine platform to use... that being the mining barges/exhumers.what we need is a strip miner for gas mining... much like ice harvesters.and because gas is so light... make it only usable on the procuror or the skiff or something...to make a new ship brings in a can of worms.... people have there own take on things and balancing is a nightmare.so am i anti-gas? no... i'm all for it... but not when it makes things ridiculously easy.use what we got... don't reinvent the wheel.and i meant no offense... but seriously... its way to much work and effort... keep it simple.
1/13/2010,for quantum rises again
1/13/2010,yo eternal..i'm not into fw or missions but it seems clear that that one example is rather odd and unsuitable for new players. i would however ask of you that you formulate your proposal more clearly than you have currently.
1/13/2010,"actually, there are reasons with packing/unpacking. from a player side is has to do with space, packaged things usually take up less space than unpackaged ones. unpackaged ones can also be affected by damage and (in theory at least) other effects. from a server-side, by having the two seperated it save s a bit of database space as for all those that are packaged you don't need to know anything about it other than it's reference item and how many of them there are.there isn't, though, a good reason that i can see that it doesn't auto-package undamaged/unmodified equipment when loaded into cargo/hangers."
1/14/2010,"i'm voting yes.it's only fair and normal if you hit other players in what is a ""relativley"" safe area of the game to have a downside. what is out of normal is to do that and proffit from it triple. one in having fun griefing, two in the loot from the poor bastard and third in the form of inshurance.fact is that you dont care so much about the min prices as noone really cares. i'm happy with them being low , more bs'es for me. you care only to be helped to keep grief people. and maximise your proffit in that with no actual loss. well it's time for a change ;)"
1/14/2010,"now that i see all the ships, i don't think this is a problem, except on the caracal. none of the other ships that can fit undersized weapons ever do (unless i'm mistaken)."
1/14/2010,"i think the bonus on light for cara for example is so that assult missile launchers get bonused.assaults are cruiser weapons just as medium electrons/ions/neuts are cruiser weapons.because the ammo gets bonused on cal ships instead of the guns it does mean that a cara fitting standard launchers would get bonused on bloodclaws from them launchers.i dont think many cara pilots would fit standards instead of assaults as assault are allready very easy fittings.looking at the fix i have proposed , the cara would get its rof | dpl bonus to assaults|heavys|heavy assaults all cruiser based weapons.so any lol standard launcher fitted cara's would of course have to fight without a bonus."
1/14/2010,"haha, you have this completely the wrong way round. it is a benefit - it means that the pilot does not need to invest a few weeks' training to gain the damage that the ship is balanced around. instead, he gets the damage output that the ship is balanced around as soon as he can fly it. yet you want to punish the pilot by making him have to train weeks of skills to achieve the combat effectiveness ordained by ship balance considerations? for shame..."
1/14/2010,"i think this is the real reason you're not getting support from anyone else here and the source of many of these flames. let me see if maybe i can help explain this to you (and a few of the people arguing with you though some seem to have realized this recently): everyone else looks at cmb vs cmb fights as a part of eve combat but a relatively small part of eve combat. you, on the other hand, are complaining not that the ships are necessarily unbalanced but instead that you are getting very little real benefit from your skills in these cmb v cmb fights.where this debate is falling apart, however, is when you try to argue against people who say ""but these ships are balanced against each other unless thew cmb suffers from a fitting issue"". you then bring in other ships and say ""this cruiser v race x pilot can kill that cruiser iii race x pilot in the same ship.most of these other pilots are concerned with overall game balance more. if you make this change then you have to rebalance every cmb that gets this changed bonus without touching the missiles/launchers themselves. if you were to change the launchers/missiles then you have to rebalance every ship in eve that fits launchers as a primary/split weapon system.do you understand how much time this would take? yes, your caldari cruiser/frig l5 doesn't help you much against shield tankers (are you really switching to exp for t1 armor? it's probably the 2nd most commonly plugged hole in eve and not that much of a dps difference even if unplugged.) with lower ship skills but is it really worth a month or two of dev time? you can't balance a ship against itself without changing its balance against other ships too.i find two flaws with the logic here:a) assuming i accept that only 1/3 of your pvp is against armor tankers excluding gallente t2 then you do only get 1.66% from the weapon skill itself. however, if there is a ~20% resist difference between kinetic and em resists then you are trading the other 15% average dps from that skill for the ability to deal ~30% more real damage (don't have time to do the math and it varies depending on the particular resists anyway). gallente are the only other race that can do that with drones but drones have their own drawbacks and require guns too to match the dps of a dedicated gunboat (minmatar lose almost that much dps by moving up to longer range ammo for a different type).b) skills are not and likely should not be balanced around anything other than training time to benefit ratios. fitted ships are balanced according to combat.a bit off-topic but still relevant: if you look beyond cmb vs cmb combat then none of cmbs' problems are ""not enough dps on em missiles"". cmb (and caldari in general) problems are either not enough slots, not enough fitting, and travel time on long range missiles. these flaws just affect certain ships or launcher types and those certain ships/launchers need to be looked at. an across-the-board boost to non-kinetic cmb dps will take the cmbs that are working very well right now (most notably the drake) into complete op levels and only take many of the bad ones into not as terrible as they used to be territory. it won't make the nighthawk into a real command ship with gang links and it won't let you fit something resembling a tank on the caracal or hookbill.ps: i've noticed several references from you to full-spectrum rockets not being lolrockets anymore and ask when was the last time you saw a vengeance flying around for dps (it does make a decent heavy tackler though with all that tank)? lolrockets = lolrockets no matter which flavor of lolrocket you loaded."

1/14/2010,bad quote... sorry
1/14/2010,"as you continue to not understand what i am talking about, i will try to explain, many inhabitants of lowsec, and i mean the people who really live there, spend more time fighting in large battles against rivals than in little, smaller gangs of pirates. yes, there are people who gatecamp, and quite frankly ive never understood the attraction to it, it is boring, but each to their own.yes, we ar ecriminals, but we fight the other criminals and antipirates, that is how lowsec really aught to be, not a place where carebears, yes there are craebears in lowsec, but tghey should be in organisations that can defend them.all i ever see is small minded people moaning that lowsec isnt safe for carebears. no it isnt. it isnt supposed to be!im not interested in making lowsec more attractive to cxarebears so they can be ganked, what i am suggesting is that lowsec should be a place where criminals fight their rivals, where antipirates and bounty hunters go to hunt their quarry. where smugglers make their fortune. it isnt like hisec. it isnt like 0.0, even npc 0.0, it is where the criminals and outlaws of empire live.i bet if i made a post saying lowsec should have concord, and much better rewards for carebears and some ore that makes twice what hisec gets, you emo guys would be like 'hell yeah!' well, you have those places, hisec, and get some nice safe 0.0 and go mine there. leave lowsec to the people who actually want it to be dangerous and dark.so to reacp: none of this post is to encourage more carebears for ganking.and i agree with the gate guns thing, yeah it would be unbalanced to not have them shoot. however, i wasnt thinking about interceptors since we can boost a hic up to a scan res of well over a thousand to do that job, and with an infinite point. so no, again, i wasnt thinking about ganking carebears..."
1/14/2010,"i agree that low sec needs some love; as a pve carebear i need some good reasons to give it a go apart from being an easy kill mail for an ""ebil piwate"".there was a black market skill but ccp took it out and never put it back in. it was one of reasons under the old character creation system to make an intaki commercial pilot with high charisma as they were supposed to get this from the start. blackmarket and smuggling skills combined with cloak and transports could give a very lucrative profession of smuggler, taking these dodgy goods from low to hi sec.someone on the fringe between criminal and empire, perhaps add a npc bribe skill giving you a chance of docking where you normally could not.the problem i think is that low sec has become synonymous with lawless, whereas it should have been more about ""free market enterprise"", brave new frontier, and no big government on your back. somewhere for the little guy to make his mark, instead it is all about sov and alliances bullying the little guy worse than the empire bureaucrats and tax collectors.no wonder many people don't want to go there!"
1/14/2010,"anything to set low-sec apart from high-sec is fine by me, we need more people to live there.some of the ideas you have do not however take into account that it is still empire, just not patrolled as diligently as high-sec.1. sentries are concord, and thus not avoidable (would be a bit much as well ). better to give huge discounts on pos fuel consumption, station services costs, perhaps an increase in sec gain from rats in system(s) and a dividend skimmed off market transaction fees.2. no. grind lp for fancy (now godly) faction boats in relative safety compared to 0.0 agents?3-4. the amount of contraband in game doesn't warrant it. a nightmare having been captured and re-commissioned to do good instead of evil, why would the empires object - it is the ultimate slap in the pirate factions faces .5. smuggling has never really existed; its a nice idea, not really low-sec but rather high-sec related since that is where the enforcement is.perhaps tie it into #1 allowing ""free passage"" of goods into the high-sec system bordering a ""haven"", move npc buy orders around to make several juicy possible routes.6. wouldn't special encounter sites be better, maybe even a spin-off of the pirate magnet system upgrade thingie? you need to figure out how system dominance is obtained and held first though. you ideally want a mechanic where different corporations fight over control of the most valuable systems similar to 0.0."
1/14/2010,"ccp mentioned pirate factions getting involved in faction war. i suspect that this would be linked to their other ideas of viceroys. maybe ultimately allowing pirate-aligned capsuleers to take control of losec systems.ccp destroyed the real black market, and smuggling occupation, when it allowed placement of illegal items, such as slaves and boosters, onto the regular market.so, for some of your proposal:* push forward with pirate faction warfare* remove the ability to put illegal items onto the regular market in hisec space* put a couple of pirate agents into space in lo-losec systems (maybe 0.1 or 0.2 sec)"

1/14/2010,"in my experience, the macroers never left. i've got petitions from last summer against obvious bot miners, and guess what - every time i see one of those characters (and i've seen pretty much all of them in the last 2 months), months later they're still bot mining away. unholy rage was about rmt traders - any macro users it got rid of appear to have been removed only in that they were connected with rmt types. as far as the mineral pricing trends for the last year, other than pyro, mineral prices now are pretty close to what they were a year ago - the runup was most likely due to a major demand increase after the major war goodswarm and others were involved in last spring, that saw thousands of ships dying. the pyro runup from what i see as the head of a miner corp is apparently due to a scarcity of scordite in the belts more-or-less with dominion - my roomies that specifically work scordite are constantly running out of rocks before anyone else is, despite our deliberate decidion to have an equal number and close to equally skilled set of miners working each rock type (except pyro, value on that has dropped to much to make it worthwhile unless we run out of everything else)."
1/14/2010,damn too many topics for the same thing.i wrote here my view:
1/14/2010,"that's outside of the scope of this thread, and in any case i strongly oppose it. losing a ship should be sufficient ""punishment""; it's not up to ccp to add extra penalties to stop people who play in ways you don't like. your proposal would make suicide ganking completely pointless. please remember that eve is founded on the principle of non-consensual pvp. if you want to effectively remove suicide ganking, you need to match that proposal with some other method and make your own proposal. this one is about how insurance is calculated, not under what conditions it is paid, nor is it about nerfing suicide ganking.in any case, no ""realistic"" insurance company would ever insure a pod pilot's ship. there can never be anything remotely ""realistic"" about ship insurance in eve, as real insurance companies take more in premiums than they pay out in compensations. this is why it is also foolish to expect any kind of player-run insurance to be widely applicable.""realism"" is a poor reason to do something compared to ""game balance"". at the moment, the insurance system is both unrealistic and unbalanced. my proposal is that it should be unrealistic and balanced"
1/14/2010,"qftinsurance is not the problem. the problem is supply & demand in the mineral market driving prices down to the insurance floor. the mineral supply has been buffed again & again over the years. exhumers, t2 strips, drone regions, wh's, better & better gear to steam roll lv4s, buffed hi-sec belts & now buffed 0.0 belts. nothing has been done to increase demand.edit: the addition of caps & super caps is an increase to demand. as mineral prices show, it's not enough to keep up with supply.fix the mineral supply/demand ratio and insurance will be no more problem than it was years ago."

1/14/2010,"[drake draconis]the risk needs to stay in the game... not get nerf'ed out of it.i'd say the risk is still there, actually, think of it. more ppl doing ap, more risk ? you can see 'em 15 k out and take them on. i did not say i was afk.... i said autodock on ap. while i do ap i am close by, just not actively jumping.anyway, 6 supports out of 14 is okay for my suggestion i say.again, you can do infomorph jump, but you can't make you ship dock at first station, seriously - why not?thanks for you input bagehi, but how are you going to drag 900 k m3 with you in that jump?as it is, i have naturally stopped doing this kind of transporting. as it kills my enjoyment for the game."
1/14/2010,not supported.your lazy ass can stay at the gate till downtime if you're that dumb.
1/14/2010,your missing the point.stop thinking about yourself and start thinking of others.people will not use the ap system the way you think it will be used... surely you've thought of that!
1/14/2010,"[drake draconis]your missing the point.stop thinking about yourself and start thinking of others.people will not use the ap system the way you think it will be used... surely you've thought of that!sure, i been here long enough to know that if anything can be abused, mis-used or f**** up - it will be.... no doubt about it. that's the fun part ...i can come up with lots of reason to use it, and why not possibly, but here i am throwing it up ,and hopes that something reasonable will be returned instead of just negative bs (not directed at you offcourse). i appriciate all constructive input, also those that tell me why not to use it, if thought through. so far, only the reason, i can not use it, as it might prevent ganking... also, initially i can see that it was propposed for freighters, but will be misued by all other ship types."
1/14/2010,"there is currently a gap in ccp policy covering reimbursement for losses cause by account expiration whilst in game. whilst the game time remaining is displayed on the character selection screen, it is ""small print"" and most pilots will simply click through that screen quickly, drawn straight away to the pilot selection portraits on the left. whilst those purchasing shorter game time blocks may be more aware of how much time they have left, those on the longer blocks can easily miss it, and thus the potential exists not just for them to lose ships in a manner not within the spirit of the game, but also those flying with them and depending on them.my proposal involves two simple elements that can prevent such instances from occurring to the benefit of both the eve pilot community and the gms who have to receive such petitions. firstly, a mechanism already exists in eve to notify pilots of the count down to down time. i am certain that this mechanism can be easily copied and adapted to count down the last 24 hours of a pilots account time in the same manner, perhaps with in game reasoning being a concord advisory broadcast that the pilot license is about to expire. this would give visible pop up warnings at the following timings that no pilot could miss:less than 24 hoursless than 12 hoursless than 6 hoursless than 3 hoursless than 1 hoursless than 30 min less than 15 minless than 5 minslast 60 seconds (counted down)secondly, as a visual prompt on the log-in screen to draw attention to the low account time remaining, i propose a flashing red backlight glow to the main character portrait on the character selection screen should the account time remaining be less than 24 hours, or alternatively, the actual account time remaining flash red. as well as preventing accidental losses, these steps will also enable those not on recurring subscriptions to make sure their accounts topped up just before they run out, ensuring continuity.orhan"
1/14/2010,"i happen to like this idea. it would be nice to be reminded when my times about to completly expire, as so not to loss anything. also its just nice to be reminded to pay my bill when i need to."
1/14/2010,"i support the idea orhan, i will bring it up.z0d"
1/14/2010,supported!
1/14/2010,"1. the same goes for defense, once someone gets killed, which would happen regardless because lets face it people are slow. then you know the fleet is there. there is no longer the question if a hostile fleet is there.2. have you ever considered that maybe ratters have it to easy and should be fitting for pvp, and staying in the same system's with each other, and showing teamwork? an enemy seeing a fleet of ships in a system are less likely to attack in the first place if they think the odds are bad.3. there is no reason a pve ship cant fit a scan probe launcher and still be an effective pve ship, your able to scan the whole system every 10 sec, you should already be aligned and ready to warp when you see someone show up on your scanner, so getting out shouldn't be an issue. its going to take more then 10 sec no matter were they warp in from to warp to you, they could be on grid and it will take more then 10 sec before they can lock you. 4. do you think it should be easy to afk rat and mine in 0.0 all the time, and provided a way for sov holders to see the number of pilots in system but not the pilots would you support that instead of just a delayed local?"
1/14/2010,"1. if it's a lone ratter, it's not gonna matter when he's the someone getting killed.2. ratters have it too easy? against warp bubbles, heavy interdictors, interceptors, covert ops frigates, and whatever else a 0.0 blob can bring? that pvp fitting's sure gonna counter that warp jam, ewar, webify, enemy logistics, neutralize, oh u still died, but hey, u survived a few seconds longer--it's a new record! there's no teamwork in soloing, nor is there fleeting. oh wait... u're forcing ppl to fleet up to even play the game now. it's not enough that they're at a number disadvantage so they're forced to take the most logical course of action to retreat when faced with a fleet of gankers specifically out to hunt them down. and spamming the ""scan"" button every single second is so much better than scouting the area and click ""warp to 0"" once, right?3. only u can't scan down a covert ops ship that's scanning u down. and neither can u scan down a force recon that can also be used to tackle u instead til the blob comes along. hell, even a stealth bomber fitted just to tank and tackle would work. they'll be on grid alright; u just won't know about it til u're tackled.4. i never once suggested to make ratting easier because the current local is fine as is. and sovereign defenders can still see the pilots in local to boot."
1/14/2010,"only supported if i get a new automated way to tell if people enter a system and who they are, chatless and minor delay is okay with me, 5-10seconds for my sensors to detect a ship and identify the pilot.why? well i have this spaceship see and it has these scanners, it should have an automated way to tell if there are other spaceships around without me spamming my system scanner the whole time. even if my 'detection system' only works in the system scanner's max range i could live with that. if there is still a local chat then typing anything in it automatically makes you show up on my 'detection system' regardless of being in 'range' or not. any use of chat, corp private convo would tell my 'detection system' that another ship was in system, but wouldn't tell me the pilot's name as they are on secure comms until they entered the scanner's range."
1/14/2010,"i think this is a very good idea. so it might make lowsec and 0.0-space a bit more challengeing for everyone and black ops would become a bigger part in fleet operations. on the other hand side, gameplay would become a little more realistic. be honest, a allround intel tool like the local channel is not very realistic. gathering intel in real life is quite a bit of work and so it should be made like it's proposed.supported!"
1/14/2010,"you get an interesting definition of realistic. one where an alliance controlling quite some solar systems, many planets and countless moons, where artificial wormholes, all kind of cool weapon and defense systems are available, cant put an automated cloaked drone on a gate to keep track who comes in. only when they cover cyno in it should then be a bit more complicated.so all in all what you are saying is you think that local should also show ship types?"
1/14/2010,"its your issue that your playing solo in an mmo, and if you are in 0.0 its vary rare that you are not in an alliance. if you aren't in an alliance then you get whats coming to you, if you are in an alliance then you will be the warning for the others to safe up or fleet up. this is your space, there shouldn't be any bubbles in your alliance's space, if you run into one and die, then you are the warning for the alliance, if you don't then you have nothing to worry about. as this space is your space, it shouldn't be that hard to get some help to deal with a cov ops frig, and if your fitting a pvp fit to start with, a stealth bomber isn't going to kill you before help shows up.bolded the important part, there is your issue, you can't solo rat, being in an alliance/corp is about more then ""you"" and any teamwork, be it ratting mining, fleet combat, is a good thing and should be encouraged.this is an mmo, if you want to play solo stay in highsec, that simple, if your alliance can't deal with kicking a few roaming gangs out of there space thats there issue, you have the same advantage's killing them that delayed local provides for them.no, but you can see scan probes on the d-scanner, and very few pilots are good at finding you in short order without keeping the probes out, and again, sure you will die, but you will be the warning for your alliance. its not like you don't have insurance for that raven of yours, or what have you ship you rat in. whats that you fly t2 to rat, maybe thats not the best idea since you cant insure it.the current system is to easy to get away with it, someone in intel channel screams 30 jumps away that reds are heading your way, you keep ratting, 10 jumps away, its still safe you keep ratting, 5 jumps, you align to a warp out but keep ratting, 1 jumps, still going, reds in system, you warp and cloak or safe up. as long as you can see your enemy's in local, and are paying attention to local, no ratter will ever be caught provided they watch local and intel channels, stay aligned, and warped out at the first sign of red.just because you play your mmo solo doesn't mean thats they way it should be, if you solo in 0.0, and get caught with your pants down, you deserve whats coming to you."
1/14/2010,"lol this redicules topic makes me laugh.... wts competent dictor pilot and scouts. serious, what should happen is that all high sec local should be on the delayed mode. 0.0 with delayed mode is going to be a roaming heaven. in the time the scout warns for an incomming gang and types it in intell channels the station is already bubbled. theres plenty of people to kill if u search them in the right systems on the right places with the right ships. not supported"
1/14/2010,"still on the fence...with no alternatives, the absence of local tips the balance of power greatly towards the ganker's favor (especially the cloaky ones). also, having to constantly press the directional scanner is annoying and tedious when you're on the defensive (ratter, miner).so i'll support this if:- cloakers cannot use their directional scanner while cloaked- cloakers cannot recloak for 30 seconds - 1 minute (covert or otherwise)- directional scanner is automated to ping every 5-10 seconds, with a useful display at the corner of the map (kinda like the x-wing vs tie fighter displays)."
1/14/2010,"all against i can see are of some random carebears that are afraid of being ganked and want to be 100% safe.the main reason to do it is to make 0.0 alliance wars and pvp more interesting ( which is one of the main reasons to go to 0.0 in the first place , not to be a carebear )"
1/14/2010,"no--it's your issue with me that i'm soloing in an mmo. point out where in ""mmo"" it says it's a requirement to fleet up with others at all times to even play 'cause i don't recall being put in a fleet the instant i log on. no one's a one-man army that can do anything to a blob so idk what u're so upset about when it comes to soloing. 1. do u see an alliance tag on my char?2. when did i mention anything about claiming my own space?2. read again--stealth bomber that's fitted to tackle and tank. never said anything about dps.3. i never said i had help to begin with, did i?can't solo rat? who r u to tell someone else how to play? u just want to eliminate soloing altogether by removing local. that's not encouraging fleeting--it's an ultimatum to either fleet and outblob your enemy or quit. u just can't deal with the fact that soloers won't be sitting ducks and let u ez your way up the killboards at their expense.again with u dictating how other ppl should play. i'll say it once and i'll say it again--there's no alliance i'm in.only if they're 14 au or closer. they don't have to bring the probes in to zero in on your exact location. if u're present in the system, they'll just send the stealth bomber/force recon forward and once they find u, u're as good as dead. again with ""alliance""... i'm... in... a... corp... a pretty dead one too... not an alliance...to be continued..."
1/14/2010,"u say the system seems easy for us because u only want to deal with mindless players that r as dumb as rats. and this is just like what i said before: when u come across someone with an actual brain, u want to catch us with our pants down by removing the only tool we have to defend ourselves with simply because we won't let u catch us. cry me a river.just because u play your mmo one way, doesn't mean other ppl should play the way u want them to, whether it's stop soloing or just letting your fleet get free killmails at their expense. r u paying for my subscription or anyone else u're hunting for? no. u want easy kills, make use of your own subscription, make a throwaway alt to farm kills with your main on."
1/14/2010,"except that the intel channels are now severely nerfed due to lack of local and the hostiles are only seen are if they accidently bumped into them at the gate or got ganked by them. (how do you know if that onyx is friendly? sure ask in the intel chat, and now you have a bunch of people cluttering up intel with 'who's that onyx on scan! who's that drake!' by the time that's sorted, the gankers got the raven the next system over. also it should not be necessary for someone to be a victim before the intel can be given, that just screams that you just want easy targets.people put bubbles up in their own space since its one of the few means of catching cloaky ships. most people aren't worried about the covert ops, but they don't like that there's someone in the system now giving intel and there's not a damn thing they can do about it. also, covert cloaky ships like the proteus/tengu are extremely deadly in packs. sounds like you don't make your main income ratting, otherwise you'd know that your isk/hour drops like a stone the second someone's ratting with you to the point that you may as well just mission in empire. most people in 0.0 want to limit their pve ratting time as much as possible so they can go out and pew pew.it's an mmo yes, its also a sandbox. so if someone wants to fly solo, so be it. local is a tool that gives both sides an equal advantage. the directional scanner does not give an equal advantage, it favors the ganker.why does someone dying have to be flag that lets people know there's hostiles in system? ratters/miners shouldn't be free targets for the roaming gang. if they wanna rat with a t2 ship, let them. if they dont warp out/or get prepared to fight fast enough when they see reds on local then sux to be them when they get caught.also, who uses probes to find people in belts? what's to stop people from using their onboard scanner to find people in anomolies, or just warping cloaked to a belt. (even cov-ops/sbs make decent tacklers when tanked) if they safe up, probe them out, if they're cloaked, then they should be rewarded by keeping their ship for following the rules of survival in 0.0. once you remove local how exactly does one protect themselves? no one wants to be the first victim to alert the intel channel.ok, based on your post you want:- people to always stay grouped up and earn pathetic isk/hour- intel channels to be chaotic, full of people trying to sort out who's on their scanner, and people posting that they just got ganked, unless they happened to see the group jump the gate. (and i dont know about you, but you'd be hard pressed to find someone to sacrifice accounts to be gate watchers)- easy ganks for the cloaky roaming ganggive the people a tool that can give 'the prey' a chance to survive before removing local. the directional scanner and probes already give attackers good tools to use. otherwise people will just make their isk in empire, and the situation goes back to what it used to be, and people only go out to 0.0 to pvp."
1/14/2010,im sorry but your op was just too much- rephrased it sounds like...durr i dont know why its there but i assume if we had less lag it would end the lag and if we end lag the lag will be gone.
1/14/2010,failpost again :)you know ? some ppl got it. proof for your low capabilities. i'm not going to draw you a scheme. ;)thanx for the bump anyway :) pls come back with an argument mkay ?
1/14/2010,"what a charming op...in this thread: a proposal made by a person that doesn't quite understand how client/server interactions work or what is causing the lag they are talking about, and that wants to have irrelevant changes made to try and counter issues that are completely unrelated.*edit* removed the 'rude' bit, that was meant for a different thread where the op's being a donkey..."
1/14/2010,"you being polite i will answer polite. it's true that only having complete source code and also by testing one can asses the impact that those changes would have. however you dont need the source code to know that those features i'm takling about do put aditional stress on the node. question to the comunity is actually how much do they really count towards gameplay and if getting rid of them in situations where they would help lag is acceptable. nothing more nothing less. a dev might indeed shed light if it would have (if any) and how much impact on the performance. you should understand this discution as a brainstorming or forcus group or whatever you want to contribute to it please explain why you think those have nothing to do with lag. or why you think effects are vital in high lag conditions. saying that i dont understand client/server means that you do,and in that case please let us know how it works :)"
1/14/2010,theres two types of lag. server lag and client lag. your talking as if they were the same. other then that your suggestion boils down to optimizing server/client interaction. which if it could be done- im sure it would be. a suggestion this vague is a lot like suggesting we end world hunger by feeding the hungry. the problem is no one but ccp could possibly know the details of their source code- theyre not likely to release such things for our armchair quarterbacking.
1/14/2010,"again,missions=> after and only after you clear a room of all enemies, you become able to bookmark that space, to come back later without running all preceeding gates. scanning and gating mechanics remain otherwise unchanged. alternatively, allow micro warp drivesgraphics=> add 2d graphics like sparks, shells, shield armor and hull impacts. these would be client side and toggle-able!inappropriate comments removed.steviesgwhat a miserable attempt at a flame! well, not that i'd expect differently.don't you have a family or a wife.don't you have friends that come visit you.don't you have a job.i''m not surprised that of all the possible reasons, you chose the most idiotic.and again,and stop whining like a child about the fact that i don't tolerate stupidity and imbecility. you know that at least the graphical proposal is worth of approval, and if you people had the courage, you'd approve it, even despite the fact that you don''t like the original poster."
1/14/2010,"greetings everybody,i think the actual content is something worthy of addressing, generic as it may be though, therefore i think it's a shame to see it burst into flames.let me introduce a few concepts: agm or ""active game mechanic"", something that requires active input from a player (and can also be defined by the sheer absence of it, ie. a forced wait) and pgm or ""passive game mechanic"", the opposite of active and third, ""bad game design"".what do i mean by bad game design?i am aggregating what is said here, mission running is a very profitable profession which needs to be balanced out, that is probably what it is, just speculation and irrelevant, can you mission your way to whatever is perceived as a top? answer that for yourself, let's just assume that was fact for now however...here specifically, achieving the balance concept by ""not enabling mission runners too much virtual currency"" can be done with pgm - lower mission rewards, or agm - make people wait at gates every time they fill up their cargo to come to reloot or come back with a tractor/salvage destroyer, no mwd to make the ordeal slower and lower the income rate.the important stuff only begins here:achieving the same goal with agm takes away from players' fun because as in this case specifically, they spend time doing nothing (the gate wait, reactivation of the whole series), remember, game-time is extremely precious, it is only that some types of players find it easier to accept that as ""unique quality of the game"" or even ""part of the game experience"" (would you say that the hardcore players with less rl obligations find that less-irritating than people whose life is on a 4-hour timer dictated by say baby feeding requirements?)however in both cases, it is disrespectful (does not value the) to players' game-time value and therefore bad game design.in the end, a word to the op, it looks to me like he's trying to make a game ""fit"" the kind of gamers it doesn't (his rl friends) and to rub it all in, the current population is happy it doesn't fit :)and in the very end:if eve was a game which completely catered to the casual gamer (people with lots of rl obligations who can't afford to spend 3 consecutive hours in-game) it wouldn't be the eve that it is today, that is, the game experience would probably be slightly different. although it is every mmorpg developer's wet-dream to have it so forked out that there's something for everyone in it... imagine how many subscribers that can attract? missions in eve are probably the major mechanic that caters to casuals who don't want to get involved with the social things and just want to do something and do it alone.it is however weak and lame to use ""the game experience"" clich<U+FFFD> as only that, a justification and an excuse not to admit and fix (improve) instances of bad game design, regardless. with good design, experience can be not only preserved but even enhanced.thank you for your attention, have a good one,cheers"
1/14/2010,"i sincerely thank you for your thoughts, but i honestly don't understand where you stand in respect to the modifications needed, to avoid, using your terms, the bad game design behind current acceleration gate mechanics.i hope we all agree that any game can become the perfect game, as long as there's space to develop things for some players, that don't break the ""other"" players game so,quite frankly, allowing bookmarks (thus reducing or better balancing isk rewards or using any other appropriate counterbalance, when actually needed, or alternatives, like mwds) is not game breaking at all, and obviously and clearly rather opens different ways of playing (for example that pvp window i mentioned earlier).not to talk about the graphical additions. 2d is cheap, and can add immense quality to any battle.edit>>typoz"
1/14/2010,maybe you should play a game that has a pause button if you are interrupted that much? ofcourse the other option is to get a ship that can permatank the missions so you can go afk for 5h if needed wihtout having the ship go boom.
1/14/2010,"yeah, yeah, what ever.don't kill your cat just because the world hates you."
1/14/2010,"apologies if i was unclear...i count some of the things going on in this topic (forcing players to re-activate all gates every warpout-in) as bad game design and don't accept any excuse for that, therefore i support the change to get rid of that because it is nothing but tediousness. the issues raised about what kind of security-risk that poses, well that can be solved a different way (pgm over agm again).the claims as to how that would unbalance things are too vague and used nothing but weasel arguments. the missions are the only mechanic that keeps a certain kind of players interested, making it possible for that type to become ""semi-prosperous"" is well intended.thinking about it more can get us to this ""ass-backward"" reasoning, if missions are attractive, instead of introducing tediousness to them to curb the profits they can generate, the real solution would be making other types of activities more alluring / profitable.entice players to diversify, not punish them for picking the thing made most enticing in the 1st place and by design.thank you for your attention"
1/14/2010,"i would just like to mention, again, that gates are the only thing that keeps you alive if you mission in lowsec."
1/14/2010,"... and? what's the deal? don't you realize that nothing changes in favor of those misterious enemies that you're so afraid of? if anything, it's all the contrary, you (the victim of the ambush/ ninja loot) earn a tool to quickly refit and get back into your deadspace pocket, to face your looters, if you so desire."
1/14/2010,so would they... oh but you forgot that.most ninja'/gankin peeps run in packs... your ignorance is hilarious.the whole point of them showing up is they want you to shoot them.
1/14/2010,"i feel the game needs this, and i'm also up for medium and large tractors."
1/14/2010,sounds awesome.
1/14/2010,"suportedwhat i would like to see1) add a tractor ii2) take small from name - just tractor i, tractor ii and capital.3) make it so a tractor beam cannot be outflown - does it really make sense that something that is pulling something towards you certain rate can have the beam stretched by going faster then 500m/s? surely the 500m/s should be constant no matter ship speed?note - saying using an orca or marauder class is stupid due to the high sp investment, plus those ships apply a bonus. that means that fitting the proposed tractor ii to them would then apply the bonus. so if ii has a range of 25km, they become 50km..."
1/14/2010,"supported. tractorbeams are way underdeveloped.that would make no sense. if you are heading towards the object that you are tractoring at more than 500m/s, the tractor beam would actually push the object further away from you in relation to its starting point."
1/14/2010,"this would likely cause some serious drop in salvage prices since you'd then be able to fit 7x salvagers and a tractor on a 'cane salvager.@ op: supported, i'd prefer longer range heavily to faster speed but wither would be nice. it would have to require science v or adding a new tractor beam skill though so i'm not sure if i would ever use them unless i go back to missioning."
1/14/2010,"tractor beam is not a stick, it's a gravitational/magnetic/ other type of field that applies force to an object, it will always pull it towards you."
1/14/2010,that's why it makes no sense...
1/14/2010,i just would like to bring it to the front again.
1/14/2010,"i'm not here to argue, so i'll just tick the box and get on with my life."
1/14/2010,unfortunately i do not belong to the elite that has endless time....[insert smart argument here]supported.
1/14/2010,"i just experienced this little annoyance myself! good idea! there have been some smart arguments made against it, too... perhaps it should be limited to just one skill at at time (meaning, can only inject one ""pending"" skill that a prereq is currently being trained). suported."

1/14/2010,"and another one offers no reason. what does a themepark have to do with this?actually, we were talking about the queue the whole time so context was not an issue. what is the issue is that anyone who opposes this never ever offers a good reason to not support it and instead talks about going back to how things were before, such as:"
1/14/2010,"you do realize if everyone is of your hyper-conservative mindset and ""be happy of what is there"" then there'd be no skill queues, no updates, no patches, no developers, no assembly hall forum, no features and ideas forum, no innovation and ccp would've probably gone bankrupt a long time ago. gtfo."
1/14/2010,"i totally agree with this comment. just because it's better than it used to be doesn't mean it can't become more better ;)this person must simply believe options are evil. if people have options then they might make choices and be happy/unhappy with their choices. if someone makes a different choice and is happy with it then i might have made a wrong choice. if i made a wrong choice the maybe i can't blame my unhappiness on someone else... it's much easier just to assume everyone else is wrong because they disagree with me regardless of whether the decisions actually involve me.alternatively, he/she may just lack the ability to communicate that it's simply not a priority for them and dev time could better be spent elsewhere.@ op: i support this product and/or service. it seems like a relatively minor code change and anything that makes the skill training system less hassle to work with is a good thing imo. it's not exceptionally high on my list of features i want but it wouldn't be bad."
1/14/2010,my experience continues. after logging in to mine and ask some questions about mining. becouse i actually i did mine just a litte bit in my eve life.i have encounter that there is some players that have so much money they just go to high security and attack miners just waiting for them to blow up even if concord attack them.i cant open for some reason the links you put in your post it says error something.i want pve action please specially if it shouws 10 bs agains me it was fun until i got blow up. i feel forced to pvp i feel like i need to learn some skills that dosnt give me no money at all. i find it a waste of time the pvp becouse you attack and loose your ship or they loose theyrs. i think that is why the miner got the best deal becouse that way they just provide the material for them to blow up each other. hehehe.sorry for my broken english.
1/14/2010,"you've experienced what is known as hulkageddon or suicide ganking... which is rampant.for some damn reason they think the cause of ""inflation"" (laughs) is due to high mineral prices.. never mind the main issue is/are prices are crashing these days (ie: trit).the solution to mining is you don't mine in and around main hubs... go find a system 5 to 10 jumps out.... some quiet dead end system where mission runners are few and between and gankers cant be arsed into coming out to find you unless you really upset them.an alternative is to move to whs or 0.0... where the odds are balanced out and you have an alliance or good sized corp to back you up.which is where i mine now. :)"

1/14/2010,"i would like to see the ability to queue up skills on any character on any account regardless if another character on the same account is currently training.i am not suggesting that all characters could train simultaneously, however, i would like to see characters switch training to another character when the skill queue empties."

1/14/2010,"give them an inch, and they take a mile.this feature would be so under used it is not worth the programming. there is a fast amount of stuff that is a lot more important than this. i would prefer they focus on those things instead of this.not supported."
1/14/2010,"if you've visited the help channel any time recently, whether seeking help or wanting to provide it...you'll see that it's virtually unreadable. a frustrating, non-helping experience for everyone. i propose that the help chats be divided into a starter-corp specific help channel, that is public so that regular players who want to help can join.for example: ""state war acadamy help channel"""
1/14/2010,"not supported there exists an official help channel where everyone is free to join to help or ask questions, making different help channels will only reduce the number of people in each channel that can help. also if you intention is to make an extra channel for each npc starter corporation that is for help only you reduce the people willing to help even more as each race has 3 iirc starter corporations they might be placed in meaning 12 new help channels. if you are calling the npc corp chats 'help' and want them to become open to other players i think the purpose is to keep people from messing with them on a large scale, ie recruiting or attempting to scam them because they are in a npc corp. if you have issues with the help channel there are several other player run channels you can seek help but most likely if you simply ask your question again, wait to see if someone answers you, if not ask again you will be answered. it is very rare that the official help channel is overrun with chit-chat or arguments that make helping people impossible since it is gm and isd monitored."
1/14/2010,"have you been in the help channel recently? it's as bad as jita local during prime time. describing the giving or receiving of help there now as difficult would be charitable. no, it would increase the amount of help, because those seeking help could actually have their questions seen by the people willing to give it. i never suggested that the npc corp channel be the help channel, i suggested that the global help channel be broken down and linked to the starter corps. the channel would be public, and seperate from the standard corp channel and how many week old noobs have any idea where to look for other player run channels?you've clearly not been in the help channel any time recently."

1/14/2010,get out of jita then.
1/14/2010,it hasn't failed at all.
1/14/2010,"not a failure as previously to get a gm's attention you had to file a petition, wasting your time and a petition 'slot' as you can only have a limited number of active petitions and there are always many isk spammers. the old way you blocked them and moved on, ccp rarely knew about them until someone wasted a petition on one of them, except when they did it in a moderated channel then they get kicked or 'muted' to all. also you got to have a huge list of crappy player characters occupying your block list making unblocking real players or just managing real blocked players a real pain.the new way ccp can ban/deal with these accounts and they are not generating more crap on the players' side in blocks or petitions and ccp doesn't have to deal with isk spammer petitions for spammers that may have switched accounts already."
1/14/2010,"if i'm not mistaken, the current report function removes what someone has said from local for everyone, not only the person that reported them, correct?if so, then how would enacting a temporary local-only mute be any different from what is already being done?current solution: removes any text from reported player from local and denies them the ability to post anything new in local until the report is reviewed.proposed solution: removes any text from reported player from local and denies them the ability to post anything new in local until the report is reviewed.i see absolutely no difference."

1/14/2010,tell your stupid corp mates not to click on phishing links and not to buy isk.
1/14/2010,"1. stop making durrogatory accusations to something you know nothing about.2. put an end to your insultsif you can't follow the above then kindly stfu and move on i have zero interest in bull ****. hacking is very serious and should be treated as such. it could just as easily be your accounts financial information.since there is no option available in the petitions tab that handles this kind of activity. i am asking the counsel. i want to know is:1. what is being done to safe guard against this r/l criminal activity?2. since this activity included in game items, it can also just as easily deal with actual fiancial accounts. how is ccp protecting them from hacking?3. had my corps property been taken theough legit ingame actions i wouldn't care. yeah i would be mad as hell but thats the game. since this activity involved a r/l out of game criminal activity called hacking how can i get my stuff reimburst? 4. is ccp permabanning the character(s) that recieved my corps property which was immedately sold after they took the items.please note that the items in question went missing a full day after i revoked all rights. by not banning those character(s), the in my eyes hacking is an acceptable means to get ahead in the game. i would be more than happy to talk about this through the petition channel but again there is no category involving r/l criminal activity. which is why i am discussing it here."
1/14/2010,i got many questions. are you sure it was he who took them? could it have been another corpmate who actually had the rights at that time? did your corpmate file a petition to ccp? are you sure your corpmate really got hacked and wasn't using this as an excuse to steal corp assets? how did the hacker gain access to the account to actually steal stuff if the account was banned?how did the true owner of the account log in if the account was banned?
1/14/2010,"as james tritanius questions show, your tale don't sum up.1) if you had removed all roles how was possible for the character to access the corp wallet?2) if it was really done by that account and you correctly removed the roles start a petition under rules & policies - exploit as accessing a corp wallet without roles is clearly an exploit.3) for account stealing use the rules & policies - eula violations section of the petitions as accessing an account that is not yours is a eula violation.4) ccp can ""patrol"" the forum and the game, but the security of a player pc is primarily a responsibility of the player. if my computer get infected by a keylogger because i have an outdated antivirus or click on every link i see it is my problem. idem if i give away my username and password to a few friends and someone use it to rob me and my corpmates. ccp can try to reduce the consequences of my error but they can't stop me from doing stupid things that put me at risk."
1/14/2010,tell us more about how the csm should be responsible for real-life law enforcement
1/14/2010,"i see no proposal, op.'real-life' hacking is not ccp's responsibility to stop; if someone means to get onto your pc, intercept your data or crack your username+password for anything, chances are good they are going to succeed if the user has not taken the required steps to prevent such a thing from happening.as for what happened - there are tools and functions in place in game to check and make sure of exactly who has been taking things from your corp - audit log containers - wallet journals/transaction histories - simply-not-giving-everyone-access-to-hangars-all-willy-nilly-like.i doubt that this 'removed' player was responsible for taking things from your hangar, because, well, if he was banned (temporarily), then during his ban he could not have possibly logged on to take anything from your corp at all... after his unbanning, he will not have been able to see, let alone access any corp hangars to take things, and will not have been able to make any corp wallet transactions at all.so i guess what i'm trying to say is - pics or it didn't happen.also, nothing to support in the op."
1/14/2010,take your own advice kiddo.... this is not the place to talk about this.obviously your the victim of corp theft... a clever one at that... liekly more than one.i had a member who had an account hacked.... i managed to trace what he did wrong.used the same username as his micro#### account (msnmsg)... being that it was windows he likely get hit with a keylogger or some such.this game is famous for metagaming..... i suggest you take a step back and do a little research.your going to find out that 9 times out of 10 ccp can't do a damn thing but investigate and research to find out who lost what.so yeah... very weak case here.... not going to win points.
1/14/2010,if you check the minutes from csm4 meeting 3 you will see i've been tasked with submitting an amended proposal for account security.the idea isn't to stop metagaming etc but to hopefully make it harder for people to transfer your characters should they hack your account.usual rules apply - don't give out your username and password if asked. don't download random applications. don't visit dodgy websites with insecure browsers (or at all )...
1/14/2010,"right now system of bookmarks is the total attrocity. you have to physically move those ""vouchers"", it takes ages to load a can with bookmarks, its incredibly bulky, its very difficult to organize them, every now and then folders dissapear and all those tons of bookmarks get thrown into root folder. there are more and more people living in wormholes (including myself), bookmarks is bread and butter for us. one of the key problems which i see with current system is that its very difficult to dissemenate bookmarks among corp members. if 1 member of corporation scanned down a chain of wormholes, then its a very tedious task to move those bookmarks to other corp members. please do something about it."

1/14/2010,"bubble spam looks ridiculous, why not have them combine together when they are within the vicinity of each other or overlapping?"
1/14/2010,what?
1/14/2010,not approved.that would only make it easier to sling bubble a gate to cover all avenues of approach (not even sure if it's an intended mechanic since it doesn't display on its info).
1/14/2010,i think he means the visuals. i think he wants it so when bubbles overlap it doesn't look like two bubbles crossed with each other but two connected bubbles.
1/14/2010,waste of time.merging or non-merging will not alleviate the problem nor make it easier.the actual issue is not the number of bubbles or how messy it looks but the overlapping animations that overwhelm systems with very nasty fps rates.
1/14/2010,hell yeah! pew pew and stuff.
1/14/2010,"interesting concept. i'd say it's more along the lines of being a problem if too many people are not hostile to each other. for some time, there have been around 6 massive power blocks in nullsec controlling the vast majority of space so efficiently that relatively few new groups ever manage to move into nullsec without becoming a member of a nearby nap powerblock.if everyone in eve somehow managed to ""just get along"" then we'd have nothing but essentially empire space and it'd be just as boring running your 5,000th worlds collide in npc 0.0 as it was in motsu.i'm not sure if this is the way to stop the alliance blobbing (nothing will stop fleet blobbing) but alliance blobbing is reducing the ability for new groups to get starterd in the more dangerous areas because they're so much more dangerous for those new people than the already nap'd giants."

1/14/2010,would that be right up there with them wanting mining to not be an automated task? (aka: macro~mining)
1/14/2010,"i don't see the problem with having salvaging drones, you have to target the wreck and sick them on it, or several and send each on a wreck. letting them 'loose' to salvage everything in your control range is silly, mining drones don't work like that why should salvaging drones?"
1/14/2010,"if it simply 'jetted it into a container', then there'd be no need for the drone to use its own cargobay, no, since that'd literally be the same to the server as creating a jetcan when you salvage a wreck for the loot to go into (if there's anything left in the wreck), thus creating a new container. (as far as i'm aware, anyway).as for the child in the back-seat behaviour, this would only occur if the drone had to be an entity with its own cargohold, since the cargohold is essentially what the drone needs to exist as an entity for - no box of popcorn for the kid and it just goes to sleep out of boredom.if the drone had to be bringing the salvage back to the ship, that'd still require the load-unload ai routines and ai shutdown routine before scooping. as it is, the ai would need to load/shut down when launching/scooping the drones anyway, but all drones do that already (with mining drones and fighters being the only ones with 'extra levels of complexity' to their ai).i still see this as a fluff-addition rather than a needed feature - there are so many other/better things that would be more valuable to have added to the game that could end up using the same server resources required for this, and the same programming time/effort required for this..."

1/14/2010,"ok these new experimental storyline missions are very badly designed for all sorts of reasons:a) force you to go many jumps into low sec (yep pve ship through pvp pirate space)b) are fw warfare linked so take you to systems with fw pilots waiting for you as well as the piratesc) take people to the same few systems (because of the fw storyline link) so those gates are player pirate camped as they wait for the missions runners to appear to give easy targetsd) are way above the agent level you are running for e.g. the level 2 storylines are harder than level 4 missionse) give a crappy reward of an implant that is worth about 100k iskthese experimental missions were introduced as a surprise in dominion, with it appears little thought or understanding of the mission runner player base by the eve storyline board in atlanta with no testing on singularity. in the dev blog words they were really excited about these missions which shows what idiots some of the ccp developers and pve content writers have become and how little they understand or care about the pve player base.btw these storylines are going to all players so you find that you have run 16 mining or courier missions to be rewarded with one of these uber pvp combat missions as a storyline to get faction standing. so think about that - you are a pve industrialist\miner non-combat pilot and you get given one of these storylines and may be given another after another 16 missions. so non-combat pilots grinding faction are being given these uber forced fw and pvp many jumps into lo sec missions.my proposal has three parts:1) remove these experimental storyline missions. they were an untested very bad idea or at least give people the choice of one of these or an ordinary storyline mission. give us, the paying customer, the choice of being a lab rat or not.2) investigate why ccp thought it was such a good idea to put this rushed content through as an add on to dominion. why was the impact on pve players not properly thought through and the csm should raise questions about the competence of those ccp developers tasked with pve content if this is the best they can come up with. the paucity of the design of this game content raises serious questions about all involved and ccp's commitment to the pve player.3) ccp should properly test all content and especially pve content beforehand. csm zastrow has written in another thread about how ccp seem reluctant to use the csm as a focus group to concept test content at its very early stages. thanks to the interwebs this form of idea testing is not difficult, use internet meeting tools and survey tools - many of these are free. then once implemented experimental stuff should not just be forced down people's throats, we should have a choice whether to take part in this experiment (hence the offer two storyline missions idea). at the moment gallente missions runners, especially those grinding for faction, feel like victims of poor game design.i am all for more content and experimentation with customer feedback but the way that this has been done smacks of rank amateurism by people with no understanding of the pve playerbase."
1/14/2010,this thread is not the correct place to post proposals. you can post a link to the proposal in the assembly forum (which i see you already have) and we'll look at it.however what you posted above is different to what you proposed. please either edit the original thread or confirm the linked proposal is what you want the csm to look at (it helps us if all the discussion is in one place).

1/15/2010,thumbs up!
1/15/2010,yep 4th bonus pls
1/15/2010,"you are either and idiot or a troll or bothdrone ships can no only apply theirs bonus across all damage types they also can apply them to light, medium, heavy and sentry drones.would you support a change to drone ships that means their bonus only applies to their racial drones? this would mean dominix only gets a bonus to gallente drones.would you also support a change that means drone ships have a limit to the size of drone that is bonused? frigs only bonus light drones, cruisers only bonus medium drones and battleships only bonus heavy and sentry drones?seems balanced right braniac?"
1/15/2010,if you want to jump into the way back machine.. when drones were originally overhauled (15 deployed max to 5) the dominix/vexor/ect all had their drone bonus changed to thermal drones only.. it never made tq because of screaming protesting..
1/15/2010,"drake is already a good ship, some may say it's already overpowered."
1/15/2010,"i was on a trip so sorry for the late reply.raw dps alone is mostly meaningless and a poor excuse, because all turret based guns have tracking and only one and much shorter optimal, while missle have their complete (long) range as optimal. sure a pulse harbi can out-dps a drake, but it has a fraction of the range, still has issues like tracking and cap usage and no choice of damage type. when switching to long range t1 ammo a drake out-dpses the pulse harbi at 3 times the range, with t2 long range ammo the harbi has barely higher dps but still a third of the range (this is outside drone range so not counting). at close range the picture reverses, but what did you expect? with beams the comparison becomes even more pathetic.finally, you can easily fit multiple damage mods on the shield tankers without sacrificing tank, unlike the armor tankers.actually your assessment is incomplete and biased. you are cherry picking the aspects that favor your proposal.i don't see why it does ""blow my argument out the water"". mini has the choice of damage type and blanket bonus, but still has downsides like the turret issues and split weapon systems. like the other races mini also cant match both range and dps of caldari. an arti cane matches the drakes dps with t2 lr ammo, but with 2/3rd of the range for the turrets (and thats not using the kinetic bonus for the drake!). with t1 lr ammo and still not using the kinetic bonus the drake out-dpses the cane at almost double the range. the problem with missls is you can't trade range for dps by switching ammo, but that is a different subject and imo that is already well balanced out by other factors."
1/15/2010,let me ask you this aineko macxdo you consider a rof|dpl bonus to be better than a 5% kin only bonus ?
1/15/2010,"i do, and i'm pretty sure he does as well.edit: hell, who am i kidding. everyone thinks a rof/dpl bonus is better than a 5% kin only bonus, or we wouldn't have this debate and you wouldn't have suggested the change in the first place. what's your point?"
1/15/2010,so conversly is it also fair to say that you thinka 5% kin only bonuses is worse than a 5% rof|dpl bonus ?
1/15/2010,yes.(i know where you are going with this and i will say that your conclusion is flawed.)
1/15/2010,"since you've stated that this thread isn't about ship balance issues, are we to assume that you think that a 5% rof|dpl bonus is not superior to the kinetic bonus? in which case, why are you proposing this idea, since it wouldn't benefit the ships in question?if, on the other hand, you do feel that the 5% rof/damage bonus is superior to kinetic bonus, please explain your comments to the contrary, demonstrate that the ships affected require boosting, and that this is the appropriate boost to apply. you should discuss identify current weaknesses, compare and contrast alternative changes, produce comparisons between the affected ships and their racial counterparts. you have three hours."
1/15/2010,"you really dont , as actually i want your support.you have basically agreed with the op that kin bonuses are poor compared to 5% rof bonuses.what would you suggest as a fix ?caldari missile boat pilots should enjoy just as much benefit from there training as other races pilots."
1/15/2010,"that's where the flaw comes in. as gypsio said above, the fact that rof and omni damage bonuses are more powerful than kin-only damage bonuses means that it will buff the affected ships if the change is made. you can't just say the racial bonuses of one race is inferior than another and therefore it must be changed, you have to identify the short-comings on a ship to ship basis or it will imbalance the game. as an example, would you say repair amount and repair efficiency bonuses are worse than resistance bonuses? if so, do you support changing gallente and minmatar ships to +5% resistance/level?"
1/15/2010,"ah. so this is not about balancing ships, it's about making the numerical benefit of skilling up equal for all races, just for the sake of equalizing it. your argument has been ""the kinetic only bonus is worse than a blanket bonus"", which is correct, but is no proof that something is imbalanced and needs to be fixed.you understand that by asking for the bonus to be buffed, something else will have to be nerfed to keep the balance? so, what would you give up for this change, and why would it be better (as in: more balanced) than the current situation?"
1/15/2010,"i didnt say the bonus is inferior , you did.i asked you what you would suggest to fix it ?you havnt answered my questionor are you of the opinion that caldari mb pilots should suffer poor bonuses for the sake of game balance ?which btw doesnt exist , even gypsio is of the opinion that many although not all cmb's are in need of help.although he favours individual fixes per ship which do nothing to correct the imbalance of bonuses.on your last point i'd have to say 1 fix at a time please.i have my hands full with this one atm.if you wanna start a thread i will give it my considered opinion.if i have select 5% kin to pursue its because of all the bonuses its definettely the worst.fixing it would in my opinion , give us 4 pvp capable races to play , instead of only 3.5."
1/15/2010,"of course its proof of something, its proof that caldari mb hull training is less benificial than traing on other ship hulls.something would only have to be nerfed if something became op.you assume balance where there is none.it is impossible for a ship to be balanced if it recieves far smaller bonuses than its peers.it is possible for it to be balanced at any partivcular player level , but it cant be balanced at all player levels.most evidence in game seems to point to the fact that cmb's perform poorly in pvp compared to there peers.covered in many previous post , please read up and dont ask me to re-iterate it all."
1/15/2010,"so you're saying that the kinetic only bonus is the reason caldari are only half capable at pvp? that statement reveals quite a lack of knowledge. even just saying ""caldari suck at pvp"" is highly debatable i'm all for balancing ships if they are shown to be underperforming or overpowered compared to their counterparts. you haven't done that. if you want to start looking at general balancing stuff, why don't we start by addressing the lack of a skill reducing signature resolution for turrets? missls got guided missile precision...edit:so why are some caldari ships like the drake so much more efficient than it's counterparts for low sp chars?the burden of proof lies upon you, because you are saying that years of balancing by ccp is wrong."
1/15/2010,it does not need to be fixed because it is not broken. just like repairer effectiveness & efficiency does not need to become resistance bonuses just because they are inferior to resistance bonuses. so you don't think the kin-only bonus is inferior?
1/15/2010,assuming balance exists then it is accurate to say.ship x is balanced against ship y after taking into consideration all aspects of eve combat at player skill level 1.ship x receives 1.05% scalar increase in damage output per player skill level.in order for there to be balance.ship y must receive 1.05% scalar increase in damage output per player skill level.any variance in the level of increase in damage output means it is mathematically impossible for ships to be balanced at all skill levels.there is your proof that there is no balance.
1/15/2010,"assuming balance proves there is no balance? what kind of math is that?but seriously now:there is your error. the quote above is not what you are basing your argument on. you are basing it on the statement: ""assuming all racial ships and weapon systems have identical stats and mechanics"". if that was true i'd agree with you."
1/15/2010,let me rephrase and expand as i seem to be going to quick for you.in order for balance to exist the following 5 statements must be true.ship x must be balanced against ship y at player skill level 1.ship x must be balanced against ship y at player skill level 2.ship x must be balanced against ship y at player skill level 3.ship x must be balanced against ship y at player skill level 4.ship x must be balanced against ship y at player skill level 5.any deviation from the above shows that there is imbalance in the game.do you concur ?
1/15/2010,"no. it's well known that the game is balanced around max skills. and, occasionally, taking snakes etc into account as well."
1/15/2010,"i do not.you can't judge a ship by the influence a single skill has on it. you need to verify the effectiveness of the ship in actual combat in combination with a group of skills/certain amount of player sp. this has to be analyzed statistically to get meaningful results.finally, you cannot compare skill bonus solely on numerical value. for instance, an x% range bonus has far greater impact on an already long range weapon system then on a short range."
1/15/2010,"allready done , go back to post [152] and download the results on the analysis for yourself.statistics show a strong favourtism accross all ship types towards minimatar and gallente.cmb's with the exception of the drake / cerb score very poorly.if you are a pvp'r it wont tell you anything you dont know allready.cmb's are poor pvp ships i.e. they are not balanced.there is your statistical proof to go with the mathmatical proof and if you are a cross trained pvp'r it would also go with your proof from experiance that cmb's are week and have room for improvement.this fix would help lift cmb's and improve overall game balance.more importantly at the same time it would remove the frustration felt by some cmb pvp'r at having to fight without any benefit from there hull training in many situations.it equalizes the benifits of hull training across all races.it offers more options for cross trained pvp'r who want to do solo/v small gang pvp than are currently viable.it ensures that as caldari pilots train up they do not get left behind.if there is any current balance in cmb's i'd have to say its at low skill levels.which is why most experianced cross trained pvp'r tend to favour guns.cmb's just dont keep pace with other races ships as you skill up."
1/15/2010,"just wanted to add one more thing before i sign off for teh weekend.on the subject of burden of proof.it is not a requirement on these forums to show absolute proof that something is wrong.other topics generally get by on an agree/disagree nature.if the csm ever raise this topic to ccp it will be the dev's job to look at the points raised and determine if there is an issue.they will do the maths and the statistical analysis for themselves.its not my job, or responsibility to get 100% undeniable proof.if that were the case then no issues would ever get raised, players do not have that kind of access to the required stats and you know it."
1/15/2010,"better, but that sheet can lead to wrong conclusions.i ship that poses a greater danger is more probable to be primaried, so the k/d ratio is not a good indicator of ship balanced-ness.also, where did you get those numbers from? 32 times more huginns than rooks? really??also your sample size isn't big enough to produce statistically meaningful results for the lesser used ship classes.your mathematical proof was shiznits and your statistics point to multiple things, they fail to isolate the single factor you are building your argument upon. the only real issue i see with cmbs is in large fleet fights, and in that case, damage bonus is the least of its problems. we've been over that multiple times i sort of agree for some ships, but the kinetic only bonus is not the issue/rainbow bonus is not the solution."
1/15/2010,goddam it! why wud it be such an imbalance? i mean just take a look at pvp. for e.g. solo:solo takes place close range just b-coz u need to get a point on ur enemy so he does not warp out (not talkin bout neuts/nos'es).now look at the caracal. just fit a point on it & u destroy a tank that is hardly present anyways. so if u want to add a few close range launchers (ham's) u simply end up having a hard time fitting it. not even thinking of dmg mods here. to have the slightest of a chance in a solo 1v1 u wud need more dps to be able to survive at all. saying addin a rof or dps to all missile bonus wudnt make this ship any more dangerous at least not much more than it is now. and the carrie might be only the worst example of caldari designs. imho cald. ships lack grid/cpu. and im not even thinkin of mwd here. try to fit that on a caracal which u wud need if u were going for ham's. the ship is almost dead in the water and not very useful if u dont have support to back it up. all the other races can fit good solo platforms and perform pretty well on their own. even the mimi shield tankers have another bonus which is weird if u think of caldari beein the missile and shield race. mimi bc's get a %boost to shield rep per level. and to get that kind of benefit on a cald. ship u either have to fly an assault frig or a golem.but well ok this is not bout shields it is bout missiles.cald. ships are broken and should be thought over so we get 4 pvp able races and not only 3.5. and the low sp effective drake is no argument as there are other races ships that are peformin as well as the drake does on low sp. funny how everyone mentions the drake 1st and most of the time the drake only. imho u should be able to see that ur all reducing caldari to a few ships only. and the drake takes the lead... supported!
1/15/2010,"caldari is still the king of pve.it just lacks options at solo pvp, i say that's an acceptable trade-off."
1/15/2010,"spoken like someone who hasn't spent a lot of time in a pirate's shoes. or, err. pod. it's extremely difficult to get into a fight with someone that doesn't want to be caught.don't believe me? i'll take my nub ship to any low sec system of your choosing. i won't dock up. i'll give you 4 hours to hunt me down and kill me. 4 full hours of glorified hunt-the-griffin. you won't be able to catch me.also, i'm not sure how many missions you have run in low-sec, but the rewards are not significantly larger. it is barely noticeable, especially when compared to the rat bounties / salvage / etc. and yes, i have run l3s and l4s in low-sec (and l1s in null-sec, woo!).the op isn't looking to make pirating easier; he is looking to add flavor and reward to low-sec. right now most people are in high-sec (very low risk, decent reward) or null-sec (high risk, but high rewards). low-sec has no reward that you can't find in high or null sec. it has no real reason to exist either. nothing that makes it special or interesting.personally i find the idea of a 'black market' to be particularly interesting. perhaps this is a place where pirate ships and modules could be put up on the market instead of the annoying contract system. i also find it contradictory that boosters are illegal in high-sec, yet you can put them on the market. what gives?npc pirate factions deserve stations and agents in low-sec. it is supposed to be where the criminal elements are, yet they have zero presence other than being rats in belts. what gives?allow corporations to make deals with the npc pirates in local systems. the effects can be as simple as the belt rats leaving you alone, unless you fire first, giving you a possible edge in belt combat and perhaps allowing you to aggress under gates and stations without sentry fire.fix the low-sec ore so that it is valuable. there is no reason to mine in low-sec right now.i bring out this oldie-but-goodie once in a while: bring back pirate ship logs. these add flavor to the game. ccp, why did you remove them? instead of pointing to the systems with static farmable static complexes, allow them to be 'used' to add an expedition to your journal that takes you into a nearby low-sec system. also, allow them to be turned into the appropriate pirate faction for lp rewards (a reward for recovery of sensitive information). you can do one or the other; get the lps, or get an expedition.i also propose that there be a split in invention. ""concord sanctioned"" invention, where things continue as they are now in high-sec. ""illegal"" invention, where you have the chance of inventing higher-level meta items, or completely unique items. this can tie into the black market idea, and exploration sites that exist only in low-sec. this is scientific invention that is deemed 'too dangerous' or 'unethical', so cannot be carried out in high-sec.this would be awesome."
1/15/2010,"i'm 100% in favour of #7. i want there to be no possible way to go from minmatar space to amarr space without traversing lowsec etc.this could create multiple trade route pipes. the shortest ones would most likely be near permanently camped, creating a lucrative smuggling business, as daring pilots in cov-ops, fast frigates, or cov ops haulers get hired to break through these camps to trade inter-regionally (smuggling should not be versus npcs, it should be versus other players).you could basically chose to go;a) through that one low sec jump from region to region that is most certainly camped, orb) you can choose to take a more round about route that would lead through 4-5 or more low sec jumps, increasing your exposure, but reducing the risk per jump. there is too much high sec in the game. although i do agree, that beyond what i've said above low sec needs a real reason to attract the criminals of eve. i really hope that a low sec revamp is included with the incarna expansion, whenever it comes. i hate the idea of wis for the sake of wis, but if it could be coupled with nefarious deeds that could only be accomplished in low sec stations, i feel the two could be good bed-partners for an awesome expansion."
1/15/2010,"i would like there to be an option that would allow pirates to gather bribery passes, so that you can smuggle drugs into highsec without having to deal with customs agents scanning you down and fining you, the dialog box that comes up telling you to pay a fine or die would now have a 3rd option to 'bribe'.also, transfer of killrights, people can sell their killrights on the market. that would make for an awesome black market. i can see it now, right click on kill rights, 'generate kill right certificate' and poof a new item comes up in your inventory that you can put for sale/contract (like a plex), with the expiration date in the name.. like ""john doe - 10:10:10 10/10/10"" - 1 isk."
1/15/2010,"i support the idea of giving lowsec a reason to go there. this is the central issue with lowsec's lack of population. and here's the thing - all these people talk about remove high sec, limit high sec routes to place in order to force people into lowsec. forcing people to do things they don't want to do generally fails - you have to make them want to do it, which means incentivizing low sec, not nerfing high security space.let's face it, lowsec has all the disadvantages of nullsec, and none of the advantages. you can't claim the systems, so the sov holding alliances have no real reason to maintain a presence. the difference in reward is minimal when compared to the suddenly increased risk versus high security space.when you get right down to it, wormholes are what low sec should have been in the first place. it needs to have something unique in order to draw people there, or you get exactly what we have now - a vast swath of space that people rarely visit because there's no reason for them to do so."
1/15/2010,"such as bribing the police to allow an outlaw to operate in high-sec for a limited time without being fired upon?edit: what about missions that send flashy red people into high-sec? ""we need someone to take care of a 'problem' in a very discreet manner... you will be able to access this system for the duration of the mission. don't worry, i've made certain that the local law enforcement will turn a blind eye to your presence for now."""
1/15/2010,"removing half of the quote change completely the meaning.for your dare, if you can do something meaningful in those 4 hours beside jumping from safespot to safespot, you are very good (and using a ship with a extremely low signature).only partially true. how much sp you have in social skills? how well you have chosen you corporation, based on value of the lp (gallente lp store is the worse in my eyes)?the largest gain and difference between high sec rewards and low sec missions come from lp and to capitalize it to the max you need high levels of sp in the special connection skills and use a corporation with a good lp store. when you get 3.000+ extra sp each mission and convert them at 2.500 isk/lp you can gain an extra 15 million/hour if you can run the missions. the problem is that it easy to find you and disrupt what you are doing.so making it even easier to disrupt low sec activities will not help populating it and i doubt it will increase the fun of those living there."

1/15/2010,"sir, your post makes a very flawed assumption: that the user can prevent themselves from being hacked/infected. this is not a completely true. the only method to insure one does not get hacked/infected is to disconnect the computer from the network. but then it would make playing eve nigh impossible and all of this a moot point. a user can get infected/hacked by going to reputable websites. such websites can and frequently do display ads which may be from vendors that are not as reputable. this is a means to hack/infect other computers. or the reputable site's security practices and security updates have lapsed. in this case the site can be hacked and be made a relay to propagate malicious software. the user has no way of knowing if a site, reputable or not, is using best practices and is up-to-date. and even then there are exploits that may not even be known to those at microsoft or in the linux community responsible for rolling out security fixes. after all, many exploits only get fixed after they've been used and then discovered.i used to work in it for just over a decade and i can tell you that even though i'm firewalled, keep my system and software up to date, have good antivirus, anti-spyware, anti-malware softwares, don't click on every link i see, don't click on links in emails or respond to supposedly official requests for information via email from companies with which i do business, do not engage in questionable behaviors such as software piracy, etc, etc, etc, etc, i am still not 100% positive, unlike you, that i can completely protect myself.one thing i do know is that the userid/password scheme is 50+ years old, outdated and outmoded. there are many other security schemes which provide much more robust account security for the customer. many are very affordable and well worth the extra costs. so, please, before you tell the good citizens of eve that it's their fault they get hacked, you should educate yourself enough to know what you're talking about."
1/15/2010,"i work with shoshinge, and i agree with him on making it an optional feature. i would be willing to pay for an eve authenticator as long as the reasonable system to recover the account was in place in case i lose my authenticator."
1/15/2010,"additional account security is never a bad thing imo. i didn't see the difference between logging in with and without the blizzard authenticator, so there's probably no difference on the usability for the layman.and on that point, could those of us without advanced computer knowledge get an explanation as to what an authenticator does, and what the potential drawbacks might be?"
1/15/2010,"an ""authenticator"" is a small device that gives your account extra security. you push a button, and it generates a number that the server knows to be valid for your account.if you use an authenticator, your account will require three passwords to log in. the first one is your user name (which most people don't count as a password, but please remember: if someone knows your password but doesn't know your user name, they can't log in!). the second password is your normal password that you are used to typing in.the third password will be the number generated by the ""authenticator"". each number generated by the authenticator can only be used to access your computer once. ideally, this number would be generated from a ""one-time pad"" - essentially a list of truly random numbers that only the server and the authenticator share (this method is one of the only methods which have been proven virtually impossible to ""crack"" if used correctly). anyways, you push a button on the authenticator to generate the number, which you use as your third password and send it to the server. the server checks to make sure that the number is valid. if the number is ok, then the server makes it so that number can never be used again. if you are infected by a keylogger, the keylogger won't be able to get your password, because the password changes each time you log in!the downsides are that if you lose the authenticator, you won't be able to log in anymore without help from ccp. ccp could remove the authenticator, or send you a new one, but you would have to prove to ccp that you are who you say you are so that a hacker couldn't just call up ccp and get them to disable the authenticator."
1/15/2010,"i'd give this one some support, whether or not i'm a geek.anything that is optional for the player that enables them to make their account more secure should be made available to them within the means of ccp (a simple usb dongle is stupid cheap, so $7 should be more than affordable for eve customers, and profitable for ccp. after all, people buy useless key fobs for $20 anyway already).so long as it's all optional, go for it. i'll probably use some features, and not others, as long as i get to choose what i want to establish a certain level of account safety (currently that being hideously complex passwords i just about have to write down to remember and twist my hands into origami to type).supported"
1/15/2010,"so... that means ccp mails us a little hardware widget, probably a thumb drive, with a one-time pad on it, and uses that for an extra password?and thank you tom clancy for explaining one-time pads . they're basically a collection of truly random digits on some recording medium, with one copy with the user and one copy with the client. since there's no pattern, you can't predict what will be next on the pad based on previous passwords, and thus it is uncrackable unless you can access the pad itself. no other system can match the uncrackability of a one-time pad, but obviously, you can only use a one-time pad once, and it'd be a very bad idea to lose the pad.if you're confused about the ""one time use"", the pad as a whole would only have one use, but you could have a very long pad and just use a small chunk of it each use. assuming the authenticator would be on a 256 mb flash drive with 16 unicode characters per password, that's still 8,388,608 uses. even if you logged on six times a day, 365 days a year, it'd take 3,800 years to use up that single pad, so i don't think we have to worry about that authenticator running out.am i correct?"
1/15/2010,"i'm not as keen on geographic limitations on an account, as that could make playing the game via laptop on the go difficult if not impossible.i do like the authenticator idea. i bought one for my wow account when it was released (and i was playing wow) and though i know you can never be 100% secure, i was much more confident in the security of my account once i did. for $10 it was added reassurance.in the end, i'll support any optional additional security capabilities added to eve."
1/15/2010,"after a mission i dock and refit the same ship but for salvaging and looting, meaning i have to unfit guns and fit salvagers and tractor beams. this means it's a little pointless to group weapons since once i unfit them the group mode is lost.i propose that when you save your fit it also saves what weapons are grouped. that way when i recall that fit it will automatically group the slots accordingly."

1/15/2010,"if your earning pathetic isk/hr then someone isn't doing there part, i never said you ""have"" to fleet up with others, i just said it would be a good idea.besides that, lets take for example running grusita's haven anomaly because its one of the ones i run more often then not. if you do it solo in wave 3 or 4 you end up with a bunch of cruisers that love to use ecm, now correct me if i'm wrong here, but 2 ships are a lot less likely to both be jamed then just one ship running it?in addition to that, 2 ships is 2x the dps, or more depending how your ships are setup, sure you get 1/2 the isk, but in the end it should balance out because your able to run them twice as fast. i mean i might be wrong about this, but the idea seems to work pretty well for me and my corp mates..why would they be chaotic? can you not setup the overview to show who is red and who isn't? i mean sure local works for telling reds from blues now, but without local, you wont even know they are there till they hit you, or you see them on scan. it might mean you have to do a scan of your system to start with to see what ships are in space, and look for new ones, stay out of the way if your not sure. once they get ganked its very easy to tell who then gang was, you get this nice thing called a kill mail, tells you who did it, what they were flying. also keep in mind, i'm all for showing the number of people in local, so if that number spikes, get out or safe up.you mean no more brainless trolls who can see local and warp. don't get me wrong, i do the same thing you guys do, im not some mean pirate who only roams and takes your stuff, even though its fun, i make my isk ratting too. there are other ways besides local to find out if someone is in your system, and cloak is kinda ment to make it hard to find you, or see if your there.i am all for a new intel tool, and a new way to see whats in system comming up, i said that already, all you really need is a number count of how many are in the system, and you can get that from the map tbh, but lets keep it on the local channel, and just not show who is in system, just how many. ps. thanks for considering the big picture, and not just how it effects you. :)"
1/15/2010,"who is upset? getting a bit personal are we? i'm having a nice discussion with people who have a different opinion, and more power to you, its good not everyone in this game is a follower, opinion's are important in subjects like this. and who said it was a requirement, i said it was a good idea, its what you should do, you can sand box it all you want, but the best idea without local as intel is to fleet up, rat in packs, if someone isn't pulling there fair share of work in the pack kick them, you don't want them wasting your time. but keep in mind, risk vs reward, the risk, its a lot more scary if a blob shows up to kill you if your solo then if your in a gang, on the other hand, the reward is you don't have anyone else mucking up your isk making.1. would be silly to expect you to post with a main on the forums, most people in 0.0 don't, so regardless of whats on your tag, its safe to assume ""most"" people in 0.0 are in an alliance. past that, i'm not just talking about ""you"", i'm talking in general. 2. if you rat, use the space and do not have a claim to it, either by force or by sov then you should expect to be removed. if it hasn't happened yet then your lucky or in providence, doesn't matter in the end.3. the remark on tanking requires you to be in an alliance or at very least a corp with people willing to help you, you ""tank the dps till help can arrive"". while it doesn't apply to you, it does to most in 0.0.4. this isn't about you, its about 0.0 and lowsec local, and your not the only one in it.i didn't tell anyone how to spend their time, sure i might have said that its how they should rat, if local were to be removed, but i didn't say you have to or quite the game now. also, if i am telling people they should fleet up, how am i supporting sitting ducks?and you need to figure out, its not about you.. and no one is dictating anything, its my opinion that people who don't want team work need to stay where its safe to not be in a gang.i already said adding range to the d-scanner is a good idea if this happens, and if your in a scan site they have to scan you down. sure belts is easier to find you, they are in the right click menu. once again, you seem to think the idea is about you, your game play style, and its not, its about the game in general, stop making it so personal and take a look at the big picture."
1/15/2010,"1. only we still have local--that's why solo ratting is viable. if not, then no one's gonna move to 0.0 because whoever ambushes with the biggest blob will dominate the systems. plain and simple.2. yeah i'm sure u'll ignore the enemy fleet that's 3 times the size of your own closing in on u.1. for someone who just want gankings to be easier, u sure r uneasy about making yourself a target. is your gang not enough to protect u?2. or maybe we have a brain and will actually hide. fight or flight. when u get blown up, r u gonna stand there and get podded as well? same concept.3. most =/= all.4. conversely, not every system is sovereignty-claimed by someone either. and i'm pretty sure i can't take down a pos by myself if for some odd reason, i wanted to.1. again, local's still here and even if it's gone, there will be no easy targets left or any mediocre targets either, gang or no gang.2. u're supporting sitting ducks by removing local. no eyes = flying blind, making easier for ambushes to occur and the smaller gang will die. better hope that's not u.and it's not about u either because once again, u'll have no one else left to gank but bigger blobs who will roflstomp u if u had your way. and no amount of teammates or teamwork is gonna make u feel any safer if u're still outnumbered and hunted down.to be continued..."
1/15/2010,"1. covert ops can't be scanned down...again...2. i already gave u the big picture a million times. only the biggest alliance blobs will dominate the systems and any smaller alliances will die from repeated ambushes that they could not see coming til it was too late. and i don't have to mention soloers this time 'cause this change alone would've done enough damage already... unless u're in one of those big alliances, in which case, u're only trying to make the game suit only your liking. so stop pretending to care about the game itself when u know what the consequences will be."
1/15/2010,"tbh, i think your just afraid that you might have to do more then watch local, it will be no different then it is now, people will learn, adapt and move on with there lives in game. the huge blob is still gonna get you at one time or another, despite your run and hide tactics. the number in system counter is all you need to stay safe, you dont need to know who is in system, just that the number has went up, now its time to cloak up, find out and hide if its something your unsure about.you do realize that no local opens up the possibility of greifing the huge alliance's your so afraid of right? that now where a cloaked stealth bomber was a minor threat to them, its a big deal. this doesn't remove the little guys power, it gives him more power through guerrilla warfare, small team runs in kills a few people runs off and doesn't get caught because the enemy fleet doesn't know where they are. its hard to hide a blob, even an cloaking blob, its very easy to hide 2 or 3 ships.you just don't want to have to stop care-bearing every time someone comes into your system, and take the time to find out who it was. so far you have been looking at it from the isk making side, will it suck more for you, sure. will it be then end of 0.0, hardly."
1/15/2010,"nope--just trying to preserve the game for the player-base and not everyone has the protection of a big alliance, not that u'd understand.the same goes for u, gang or not, yet u still don't realize that. and what's the difference between this ""number in system counter"" and local, besides player names? did u even mention this once before? u suggested so many tweaks that don't even work at all, i lost track.yes because a hit and run is the only thing that's needed to finally take down an alliance. yeah, u can easily one shot that pos or anything that's actually valuable with a stealth bomber... oh wait, only some cheap ships sitting out of the middle of nowhere is open 'cause obviously, they're gonna guard everything valuable since they can't see the system... yeah, u showed them by blowing up that rifter... in the meantime, they'll blob your own pos and anything else big that u can't run with and there's nothing u can do about it. i don't mind when i have to stop ""carebearing"", nor do i care who the hell's coming through because unlike u, i'm smart enough to not find out the hard way.i never said anything about ratting to make isk, did i? no i didn't. it's for security status. yeah it would suck for me but it's nothing compared to your failed hit and runs because u won't have any open targets of decent value and while your small gang is distracted with that, your own pos is being shot to hell because they can defend and attack at the same time."
1/15/2010,"then why change anything?if you make it useless to go to 0.0 to make isk, but instead you should just run high sec missions, what then happens to 0.0? you dont get your easy ganks on mission runners anymore, and 0.0 becomes a pvp area? then just add arenas."
1/15/2010,"0.5 and up as is. concorrod is running the show.0.4  0.1 space delayed. concorrod dont like sending techs down there, so the equipment is down graded. 0.0 no local like wh space. basic services to the people. ( there isnt even gate guns )i like that idea."
1/15/2010,absolutely support this idea. maybe not in low-sec but definitely in 0.0!
1/15/2010,"not supported.everybody knows about jf hotdroping... now it is difficult. with this new ""local"" every second jf will die..."
1/15/2010,"there are so many overelaborations in here i'm about to be sick.1) lowsec and 0.0 is not infested with roaming pirate gangs all over the place. if you rat in r3, hed-gp, or sv-5 then yeah, you're going to run into hostiles quite a bit. but if you're in some backwater system in branch you might... might see a red or two a night. and most of the time that red is just passing through or not even looking to gank.station systems are also popular for roaming gangs... most don't even bother with belts except in those extremely populated systems. it's not worth it when you enter a system because you know 99% of the time the ratter saw you in local and instantly warped to safe and cloaked.for anyone with half a brain, local is an instant ""i win"" defense. unless you're doing something stupid and afk ratting or mining, it's hard to get ganked in a belt these days.so you swap local out, put up a 360 degree pinging scanner that scans to say, 15-20 au. it shows blips based on standings- blue, white, orange, red, etc...now, with this yeah the pirate can see you- in a sense. he/she knows the general direction to begin scanning, while you have an instant ""red in system"" reaction.this means that in the minimum of 10 seconds that it takes just to even start warping to you, you've already seen his/her presense and have warped away and cloaked... unless you're an idiot.oh, but covert ops... what about them? well this is tough since you want to keep balance. although it sounds fun, having recons and bombers having a field day isn't balancing. so with those, when someone is cloaked the scanner should make a note that there is a possible cloaked signature in system, perhaps an omni-directional ping return... letting you know a cloaked ship is within a 20au radius but the location is unknown.oh, and one more thing, ccp... add probes as a clickable type, so we don't not have to shuffle through 1000 things when scanning for probes. so from the point fo view of a hostile- you enter system, and see a blip or two in a general direction. from there you need to scan down the target and warp quickly... because the ""prey"" likely saw you come in also and is either leaving or ready for you.this keeps the balance, removes local, and adds flavor to the game. throw in environmental effects into k-space from that other thread, and things get really fun.edit: make it possible to disable that scanner also, because for fleet fights it would be a complete mess."
1/15/2010,"i agree in principle,but as written here mate is not possible make a change only local because jf would be useless...a good idea is with uplgrade system, where it would be possible under certain circumstances see local.furthermore, in the event that the local would not do that, it would not be seen cyno and therefore could jump on the safe spot..i think it would be good to do also a module, which would in the distances could find a cloaked ship or to give some ships as a property."
1/15/2010,"very well put, and you are absolutely right. why don't i want to stop every time someone enters local? easy, because that's about every 10 seconds around where i live.freighter movement too will be severely impeded. no way in hell i'm willing to risk my 650 million defenseless slow-as-hell ship because some pirates that fail at (or don't want to properly) pvp want easier ganks, and dominion or not, there are still lots of towers to fuel."
1/15/2010,"ccp wants to change that there come more people in 0.0, this would achieve exactly the opposite, 0.0 might be sometimes a bit profitable, but only when there are 3 people pve'ing per region. and defending a change that will make 0.0 even more a deserted waste land with the argument that it already is deserted also doesnt make that much sense."
1/15/2010,"that is how 0.0 is currently, not what it's supposed to be. re-read it again, if you still can't understand that i'll make it easier to understand.first, to the guy running a freighter... wtf are you doing running an unarmed ship laden with cargo unescorted? get a scout to throw out a combat probe every system ahead of you. oh god that's so much work....furb, there is nothing but your own personal opinion to the effect it would have on the population of 0.0, and your opinion based upon your views and style of play. so, i will have to throw in my own arguments as to why it would become more populated:- the replacement system i suggested favors an active defender.- the system is more accurate as it distinguishes not only who is within 20au, but also if the single red is afk cloaking or not... a bane of all 0.0 'bears- it opens the possibility of having a local channel as a sov upgrade- it encourages new roles, including roles that low sp noobs can fillhow people use 0.0 and mechanics is not the fault of ccp, the players need to work as a group to accomplish goals... it is an mmo after all."
1/15/2010,"there is a hude difference between freighter and jumpfreighter... for jumpfreighter you have to use cyno(cynoalt). when is cyno up, everyone has this cyno in overview... for jf is cloaked arazu deadly..."
1/15/2010,"only u have to run through the 0.0 entry points, which r usually infested with those roaming pirate gangs, to reach those backwater systems. and even then, u still can't risk exposing yourself when someone patrols through, backwater system or not, 'cause the further u r from empire, the more time and effort u risk wasting because every system u pass through is a potential camp. so if u get killed, that's how much more time and effort u've wasted anyway.that won't stop ""most"" of them from trying. actually, it won't stop any of them at all.no--winning would be destroying their ships--hiding is to ensure u don't get killed in a fight that u can't win in the first place. there's a big difference and it's not like u can continue ratting while pirates spend hours trying to find u. and i'm not exaggerating either because i've had that happen firsthand.this might actually work--it still gives the ratter a good chance of saving himself as long as he's 100% alert and stays aligned at all times because the added scan range will help against interceptors zipping in (although it would have to be 25 au since they can cross the added 5 au in a split second)... but the real reason this could work is that the covert ops tackler tactic won't be 100% foolproof with covert ops detection.of course, this is assuming the ppl who want to nerf local r not just aiming for easy kills because now it's gonna hinge on whether or not anyone would want covert ops detection, even if it won't give away their location. if that doesn't go through, then the pirates will just go back to covert ops tackling and it's back to the drawing board."
1/15/2010,"yes, i know. i ask again... solo? sorry, how does local help you avoid jumping into a gate camp again? how does it prevent you from landing into a sling bubble? your paragraph has nothing to do with the subject at hand.why do you want them to stop trying? this is a game, an mmo at that. see, that's a huge issue, a mentality that nobody should be hostile to you?again, what does this have to do with changing/removing local? nothing. this has to do with your personal opinion that you deserve or should be able to go into 0.0 without any sort of hostility from other players. you're in the wrong game.at least we agree somewhere :)i have 2 chars, one is pvp and a 'pirate' and the other is a carebear. i see both sides of this..it's not about easy kills, it's about not having an instant intel tool that hinders the efforts of both.defenders do not like afk cloakers using local as a harassment tool, nor having roaming gangs able to breeze through regions using local to find systems with targets.attackers do not like having an instant warning to everyone when they're in system that requires no effort at all- placing afk alts as perma-scouts up a pipe, for example.attackers do not like having covops show in local, defeating the purpose of them in the first place."
1/15/2010,"without local, you have no chance to check if is system clear -> cloaked arazuand fyi... 1 carrier as escort is not enough..."
1/15/2010,"wtf are you talking about?have corpmates escort your ship.not a carrier, but a battleship/hac escort. have them there at the cyno.my god man, wtf. protect your crap, don't expect local to hold your hand. if you're too scared to go to a system, then don't go.read the thread. you'll know if there's a cloaked ship within 20-25au. have someone scan with combat probes also. have an escort."
1/15/2010,"spaceholding alliances more often than not use cyno generators at a pos, not alts in cynoships."
1/15/2010,"do you know, how jump drive works?there are more ""jump spots"" on the way. the way can have for example 3 spots(cynos or cyno generators) between system a and system b... let say, you have to do this trip 3x(a-b). in this case is not possible make escort fleet in ships without jump drive(bs/hac) and repeat this every week.---this thread with cloaked arazu (without local) is same with cynogenerators"
1/15/2010,"do you understand how a jump freighter gank at a cynogen is typically carried out, and what shiptypes are involved? the fact that you're talking about a bs and hac escort suggests not."
1/15/2010,"constellation local.i think delayed local is too severe. it would negatively affect both the predator and the prey. although i do think with the new changes to upgrading systems making anomalies the more common place to rat rather than asteroid belts, now is the time to change the way local functions."
1/15/2010,"hello, so what is most funny thing about 0.0 warfare from my perception: war for territory, fighting while having an actual goal to achieve, participating in large fleets... how is local nerf going to help with that? i suggest ccp to focus on solving lags, that would help people in 0.0 much more.i am afraid that local nerf would also nerf a teamplay, the only people who would appreciate that would be soloing cloak gankers, who just want to have many easy kills on kb. but what do you want on your killboard? many battleships as part of a fleet or badgers and hulks solokilled on belts? i dont think the second part is something that makes 0.0 what it is. the local nerf would make 0.0 look like highsec wardecs and lowsec piracy.and people who suggest making intelligence service to watch gates - how do you deal with guys who enter system in off-peak time, logoff and logon later? i dont think that guarding gates would help you against these.there was also a word about jf hotdropping and possibility to protect it with help of corpmates. if 2 dreadnougths jump in and start firing at the jf, do you really think its feasible to have jf protection fleet at every jumppoint, that would be strong enough to kill dreadnought before it kills jf? and what if enemy uses titan? can you imagine you are a part of smaller alliance, jumping in a few capitals to fight a titan, only to receive a response of large alliance that would kill not only the jf, but also the capital fleet guarding it? small alliances would just be removed from space. 0.0 would be inhabitated only by a few large alliances and bunch of harrassing solokillers.and about freighter and other logistics - well you can use scout to find out if there is not non-cloaky gang on the way. first thing that comes on my mind: lowsec pirates enter 0.0, and place a scout. scout can see buzzard coming through gate - command: hold. after buzzard, few combat ships with a freighter are coming. scout of pirates says: get ready, they have less ships than us, decloak and kill them when they come through gate, dont let the buzzard pilot see you. freighter with escort has no chance to detect a possible threat, scouting is totally useless.well, afk isk farmers are annoying, and local nerf would help against them, but it would have to be accompanied with changes that would make possible for spaceholders to defend against solo gankers.suggestions that could help living with local nerf:1) possibility to detect a threat somehow, but making some effort for it. detection of cloaked ships with onboard scanner is good. even better would be having ""covert combat probes"" that would be capable to detect and locate a cloaked ship. scanning could take like 10 minutes... why? it wouldn't help against active pilots, but it would help against recon pilots, who enter system, cloak on safespot and go afk until defence loses attention. afk miners are annoying, but afk cloak gankers even more.2) jumpfreighters should be able to lock on covert cynos. then hotdroppers couldnt just go 100 au away in large system and do nothing but watch if there is a cyno in the overview, far from scanning range.3) combat probes should be able to display pilot's name as well, or detect if scanned ship is blue or netral/red. now, scanning an active pilot is almost impossible if he changes safespots, this could at least help to find out if detected ship is worth locating."
1/15/2010,"alliances holding more than one or two systems would end up with a non-stop barrage of ""is xyz system clear?"" and ""how many blues are there in xyz system, we see 5 in local and want to kill"" in comms without some form of fof system."
1/15/2010,add this. local as a number and this thing and you have a winning combination.
1/15/2010,"it helps before the jump where u have to warp to the next gate. nothing can counter a sling bubble if all angles r covered but if there r ppl around that u can't scan down, it's a safe bet that they'll be waiting at that sling bubble. and this was in response to what u said that most backwater 0.0 systems being empty. however, u have to go through the entry systems first and no matter how safe a backwater system is, all it takes is one enemy u can't see coming to send u back to your clone bay. removing local will only make the trip near impossible when u're flying blind while the gangs r not.1. it's not the fact that they won't stop trying--it's the fact that the mechanics favor the attacker to such a degree that removing/delaying local without adding anything else to compensate would only make the gank even more effortless than watching local.2. u commented on local being an ""i win"" button when all we're doing is hiding. hiding =/= winning. by removing local, u remove the only defense we have left. if u want kills that easily, u're the one playing the wrong game. u can shoot the crap out of anyone u want, i really do not care, but if u're gonna kill someone with an actual brain, don't be surprised when u have to work for your kills, especially if u're gonna render them even more defenseless. with all the advantages the predator has now, i don't think it's that hard to understand. idk about your ""carebear"" but any other one would rather have both sides spot each other at the same time rather than the attacker preemptively scanning whole systems, staying out of sight, and finding the prey first.neither does the prey like being ez'd with absolutely no warning or a chance to survive. and afk alts will only cover 1 entrance per account.anyone guarding the gates would see u flicker into view a split-second before u hit cloak so your cover's already blown anyway when he alerts everyone else."
1/15/2010,"why are you flying solo through the most dengerous space ( 0.0 ) and expect to be safe.how is it you are flying blind and gangs r not ? they have the same envoirment , they cant kill you unless they actually find you or you make a mistake. not only local is the ultimate defense with no effort required.somehow even poeple in wormholes manage to escape ganks and now adding few more itel gathering tools to the equasion makes perfect sense. what if i come out of wormhole , why should i be visible in local ?"
1/15/2010,is there anything other than ships and containers that needs to be removed from this proposal?

1/15/2010,"confirming the above is true- i sent this petition a while back and just got this response.hiya ccp could you give me your thoughts on just about everything? thanks fmthen i got this response...i don't think this is feasible as a csm proposal. first of all we don't know the code, second we don't know what efforts ccp has made and is making under the surface to improve the game.gm noahz"
1/15/2010,"he's representing his position as a member of the csm, stating (quite clearly i might add) that they are not entitled to the information as to the inner workings of the client code and server operations, and thus cannot decide on their end whether or not this is something they can feasibly bring up with the devs/ccp. the best they can do in their current situation seems to be one of;""people are complaining about lag, they want it fixed, but have made no proposals as to how - could you shed some light on how things work so we may present the information to them so that we and the community may be able to agree on things that could be changed to potentially better the situation?""anyway, to the op.as mentioned before, there's a high likelyhood that all information is created and sent in the same batches per grid; if you're on the grid, you receive the info, whether you're doing anything or not.now, what that info would consist of is determined by what the server has to process. below is a list of what i imagine it takes into account, with parts sent to all clients on grid being marked with a *.shipid + player *weaponid * (sent once, when you or a new ship land on grid, or someone on grid changes weapons + onlines them)ammoid * (sent once unless a client sends an ammoid change request to the server; server sends new information in next batch)position * (interpolated data)rof * (interpolated data, sent once when ship becomes active on grid or weapon stats are modified)tracking + falloff + optimal calculations (based on skills, ship bonuses/modules and other variables etc etc etc)drone positions * (interpolated data)itemid * (nos, neuts, sensor boosters etc etc)ship/drone hp information * (interpolated data with exception)there are probably a few other things that are processed and sent or not sent here, but these i think cover the more important parts.now, in technical terms, when information hits your client, it decides what to do with any given portion. examples:damage notifications are discarded unless specifically relevant to you; an exception here in the form that data for other peoples' ships is interpolated, whereas yours is not necessarily.weaponid, ammoid and itemid can all be discared for the rendering step on the client side if none are being used as per effects being turned off and your not using lookat on any given ship on grid.rof only needs to be sent once; beyond this, the server sends you no status updates for any given ship beyond 'on' or 'off' for that ship's weapons. if the ship is shooting at you, you will receive active batches of non-interpolated data. if the ship is shooting at something else, your client will process a combination of weaponid+ammoid+rof to determine what the effect should look like - you will receive no active information from the server beyond 'on' or 'off'.interpolated data means that, where your client will actively receive batches of information stating playerx used weapony on you doing damagez (the hit type is based around a modifier included with the damage amount, i'd guess), when you see another player shooting at someone else, your client is simply told player1 is shooting player2, and your client references the previously received data for player1's weapons+ammo+rof, and 'smooths' the data based on on/off states.in order for you to not receive this info at all, the server would have to create a second batch packet for people that don't want them (tbc)"
1/15/2010,"why this becomes an issue is because of the following:your client has to still receive that initial batch packet containing the ship, weapon, ammo and item ids, because it cannot afford to have to send you a special packet telling you what module someone has begun using on you when they finally shoot at you; that would require extra server resources.the server has to send out the same information to everyone on the grid when possible, because sending personx one kind of packet and person1 another kind of packet doubles server resources as it not only has to decide what information to include and what to exclude from the packet, it also has to figure out who gets what instead of just giving everyone the same thing.something to keep in mind is that your client is not locally responsible for any calculations.when you activate your guns, your client sends a message to the server saying ""activating guns"", the server sends a message back saying ""guns active"", and until such a time as your client sends a message saying ""deactivate guns"", the server will be running calculations for your guns until a portion of the calculation no longer exists (example: target lock is lost, guns reload or guns are destroyed from overheating).it's because of this that you can log off with modules active, and they will remain active until you run out of cap, your ship disappears from space or their required target is lost - your client wasn't responsible for the server doing things and thus wasn't a necessary component beyond asking the server to start or stop something.now, for the portion of data where your ship actively becomes the target of effects or you are attacking someone else, i'm not sure how processing is handled. my guess is that in addition to the initial packet you received stating weaponid, ammoid and rof, you will now be receiving a stream of active information regarding what's being done to you - this would, i imagine, still be sent by the server in batches; batches consisting of all the information of all the ships that had to be calculated for a given cycle period.whether this information would still be interpolated server side or not i couldn't say, but i would imagine that it currently is in order to save on server resources - it'd be crazy for it not to be.so ultimately, what i think your client ends up receiving is along the lines of these sets of information:big chunk of initial grid information; updated with smaller batches for new ships entering/leaving grid, microbatches for ammo/weapon/itemid changes on a ship-ship basis.constant updates of positional data and target-lock references between ships - positional probably interpolated, target-lock probably immediately updated.on/off state updates sent to all clients on grid in a chunk of data for effects representation.interpolated hp data sent to all clients on grid using percentage data vs absolute hp data, referenced only when you lock a ship (ever notice how if you lock someone their hp takes a second to update to what it really is?), discarded client-side otherwise.stream/batches of constant or interpolated data to represent anything being done to or by your ship, for visual representation on your client; this includes absolute damage data as well as status updates from the server for things such as target lock, capacitor/hp amounts etc.now, as with anyone else in this thread, i don't know if this is how things are done; this is simply how i think it might be done based on what makes the most sense to me. i have no programming or software development knowledge nor degree, so i should hope that, taking this into consideration, the guys that are responsible for eve have a far better idea of how to do things than i do, and thus have a far more efficient method.keeping this in mind, can you find any portion of the above information that you think could be reduced or even removed to save server resources? because i can't."
1/15/2010,"not supported. mwdsince it seems that no one in this thread is old enough to remember. ccp removed the use of mwd's in dead space missions around 4 years ago, back when they added lvl 4 missions, which by the way you couldn't solo. so yea, they removed them for a reason that i can't remember and odd's of them letting you use them again, slim to none.damage effects on ships, great idea. i'd love to see that added in because the current effects date back to late '04 at least. (when i started playing)"
1/15/2010,"i sincerely don't understand if you reply this way on purpose.you are writing about a completely different subject than the original, dude. get your act together already.the whole point is: if you're gangbanged, and if you can escape the warp scramble, you warp out.now, you'll have the additional grief of warping back, gating all the way into the mission (we're talking l2, l3, l4 that are common to have more than one gate).i propose that you start your mission, gate, clear of all enemies, bookmark, get assaulted, warp out, wait/ refit/ go shopping/ go to china on business/ warp back in...to the same pocket you last played intowithout passing all of the gates you already traveled throughnowreadslowlypirates wouldstill need to scan you downand gatethrough the last acceleration gate,at least (supposing that you didn't move on by then)as a matter of fact,you'd have all the liberty of warping out,knowing that you wouldn't have to travel all the boring and annoying way back.surely the pirates would be able themselves to come back later,but that's a risk you face if you mission in low sec,regardless of gates and bookmarks.check the local channel before undocking again, and check the map pvp stats if you want to avoid unnecessary risks.so end this clowning already."
1/15/2010,"so let me get this straight.... your throwing a fit over the fact you got jumped in a mission area.... went and got your pvp ship... then came back and didn't like the fact you went from gate to gate to gate and still got your @$$ kicked?what difference does it make?so your lazy?this changes nothing... and forcing the said ""pirate"" to not have the same benefets would make this a one sided mechanic.so you die faster.... big fat whoop.your problem is you fail to understand aggression mechanics... and you refuse to research it.if you bother to pay attention to what we are all getting at... you'd realize just how foolish your proposal is.if ccp and i mean if ccp would grant such a thing... everyone would have it... whether it be there mission or not due to the great and mighty ninja salvagers opinion in saying we have the right to invade at-will.so your going to make it much much worse.....even then... you fleet up with someone.. they ditch you.. now they can invade without going through gates.this is a precursor to ""instanced"" mission running.like hell that's going to fly."
1/15/2010,"if mwd are allowed in deadspace pockets, ceptors (who would then be able to tackle a mission runner almost instantly) will greet mission runners. these ceptors won't be killable by a pve-fit ship. they would be able to hold a runner in place until the gang comes to kill the runner. op likely doesn't want that.if you could warp to a ""room"" in a deadspace pocket, the same thing would happen, except it would be a cloaked ship tackling the mission/plex runner. the gang would then jump into the system and warp to the cloaked ship right after it tackles the runner. as it is now, mission/plex runners are protected from this, as the entire gang has to go through each room in turn, giving their prey time to notice they are coming or kill/escape the ship that tackled them. op likely doesn't want this either.both features not only slow runners down, but protect them."

1/15/2010,"supported. there'd have to be some mechanism to make sure that you can't get away with ""inject the skill and cancel the prereqs"", but the op has a good idea.there are two methods i see. a) to ""lock"" the prereqs. you can cancel any other skills trained, but you cannot cancel the prerequisites of the injected skill. b) to not immediately inject the skill, but rather check the hangar when it comes time, and if it isn't there, cancel the injection. both of these will also prevent people from injecting more than 24h in advance, as you'd have to have room at the end of the queue.as for ""buffing"" the queue. it is not a combat weapon. it is a convenience. it does not need to be balanced, it is simply a way of improving the player experience."
1/15/2010,no
1/15/2010,"i support the idea.the one real reason not to support it is that books have value. if i was able to inject books without needing to have the pre-reqs for them, then i can effectively transport books without fear of losing them.and people love to see others lose items in a nice fat killmail...now .. as others have suggested...""auto-inject""queue up a skill which you have not trained for before, and then when that skill reaches the top of the queue, if you have the book in your station items, or in the cargo of a ship you are in (not in a container, not in corp hanger) then it is automatically injected and you continue training. if you do not have the book on hand... that skill (and any others that require it) are dropped from the training queue.if that's the case .. i support it. it gives you an advantage to train easily, but also means that you may have to carry a skill book in your ship just so that its on hand when you need it... the kill mail hunters should like that twist."
1/15/2010,"in eve, there are a lot of ways to earn isk.to give some examples of static income/outcome and market-afflicted income/outcome:- mission running/ratting (static income)- insurance fraud (static, but dependant on market)- normal skillbooks (static outcome)- pos fuel and arrays (static outcome)- mining (market-afflicted income)- trading (market-afflicted income)- ""special"" rare skillbooks (market-afflicted income)there are, of course, several other ways to make income in eve, but let's just focus on the difference between them for now:static income will provide a income that is independant on the market (for instance, rat bounties). this is good if prices are low, but bad if prices are high.market-afflicted income is obviously dependant on market - in the opposite of static, market income will benefit from a market where prices are high, and will not be able to earn as much isk if the market is low.[problem]static income is completely independant from the market.eve needs injection of isk from npc's, to support the constant blowing-up of ships.however, in a game that is supposed to have it's own economy, npc-based income should have some sort of modifier, to actually adress the market. (lore wise, this is supported by npc's not earning as much isk when prices are low - just as market-based capsuleers)[proposal]make an ""isk-index"", that takes the prices (perhaps avaibility) of all items sold, with the exception of npc sold items (skillbooks, pos fuel, etc).compare these prices with base prices for the items (this is already set by ccp).for instance, we have 3 items:tritanium: 2,85 isk/unit (3 isk/unit baseprice)kestrel: 275.000,00 isk/unit (200.000,00 isk/unit baseprice)armageddon: 45.000.000,00 isk/unit (50.000.000,00 isk/unit baseprice)note: these baseprices are entirely fictional, and only for purpose of illustration.quick division math:trit: 95% of basepricekest: 135% of basepricearma: 90% of basepriceaverage: 1,06% of basepricefor the sake of simplification, i haven't included amounts, which should be included in order to make a ""real"" average. (eg. 2 battleships prices at 4.000% baseprice shouldn't screw up the economy of 8 billion pieces of trit)the average, ""isk-index"", could then be set as the rate for all npc-based income and outcome.that means, that if the isk-index is low, pos fuel, rats, missions, etc. will give less isk, compared to a high isk-index which will give increased isk rewards.for instance:skillbook worth 40mil, isk-index of 1,06%, actual book price of 42,4m isk.0.0 bs rat, worth 1,4m, isk index of 0,94%, actual rat value is 1,316m isk.similarly, this would also fix insurance, as it could be based on the isk-index. insurance fraud would still be possible, but on average, it wouldn't be profitable.the isk-index could be either region based or global, and both have obvious advantages and disadvantages.region based isk-index would generally make more of a ""actual localized"" market, however. 0.0 would greatly benifit from this, and highsec would probably not be very affected by it.tldr; income/outcome from npc's, such as missions and pos fuel, should be based on the market."

1/15/2010,"i think what the op wants is that if a queue finishes on one character under the 24 hour period, and there's a queue saved on another character on the same account, that it automatically starts that other queue instead of the owner having to log on to go apply the new queue.in terms of expendable alt generation, this would be an invaluable function, and i can personally say that i have had situations where it would have been of use to me.personally i can't support this because it removes a crucial choice i feel should exist in multiple-character ownership; will you log on to the character you want to start a queue on or will you leave it until you're done with whatever you're doing on another character on the account."
1/15/2010,"supported, but only if it doesn't take too long for ccp to code. it'd be nice, but if it requires a major overhaul of the skill training system and server, i'd rather ccp focused on bug fixes and other content."
1/15/2010,"i think the better way to handle this would simply be having one single skill queue shared by all three characters on the same account (likely what the op was proposing in the first place). it would still span only 24 hours, and otherwise work as the skill queue does now. the sole difference would be that each of the three characters could add skills to the queue (so they would need to denote which character the skill in queue belongs to).i would suggest that while logged into any character, all skills in queue can be moved within the queue itself, as well as removed from the queue. however, to add a new skill to the queue you would need to be logged into that particular character."

1/15/2010,"i'm not sure people realize the actual magnitude of this problem.we recently finished a four-week campaign in fw (despite all the bugs and annoying design problems a mostly enjoyable experience - a lot of good fights, both won and lost). but pretty much the whole campaign was dictated by this game mechanic.once some systems in any area are occupied, there is no way to avoid this mechanic. in the beginning, when about half of metropolis was occupied, it was no problem for either side of the conflict to run enough plexes so that by roughly 18:00, the plexes were pretty much gone - inaccessible in the systems of different occupation. our us and aus timezone players regularly complained about no plexes being there, about having absolutely no way to influence the conflict. only after dt, suddenly there are a ton of plexes again to be had. six hours of dedicated plexing later, and most if not all of them are gone - until dt.i didn't think this game mechanic would have such a huge effect even when there are a lot of systems to respawn in, but it does.of course, the fewer systems there are, the more obvious it gets. fighting for siseide and lantorn was just plain silly. dt starts, everyone get on vent, twiddle thumbs or browse the web, wait for tq to come back up. ""tq up!"" log in, log in, log in! 7 wt in local, 2 meds, 2 major! switch to med sized ships, meet at ... go go go!usually by 13:00, it was all over. the 1-2 systems were confirmed plex-free. the only time they would spawn plexes again was tomorrow during dt. fleet can stand down, everyone can ignore the systems until then.i had some of the most awesomest engagements i have had in eve so far here. it's sad that it only happens at that time of the day. a time, i might add, when i'm usually in the middle of my work day.this mechanic is silly beyond belief."

1/15/2010,"i don't quite see a problem here either...if the flow's too quick, you can ask in the npc corp chat - if it's full of spammers or other trouble makers, you report them.segregating the help channel into starter-corp specific channels just seems daft to me, as any given channel might 'need more help' than another one; this would create extra work as well as many more channels for those wanting to help players out in that they would need to actively monitor several channels instead of just one to see where help is required.it could also very easily result in one common question being asked at the same time by a different person in every one of these various channels, where a single person could have answered it in a single channel and helped 12 people at once - with your proposal the same question would have to be asked and answered twelve times at once, only to be asked again a few minutes later by another new character in every single one of those channels.i can't support this..."

1/15/2010,"yes they did a good thing, now the feature needs improving to include auto-gagging with some rules.you are mistaken that it purges the chat. this effect is only for the user submitting the report and does not effect any other user.i'm well aware of how long petitions used to take and how long they take now. spammers are spamming for longer without being removed under the current system.shout down this issue all you like, it doesn't make you anymore intelligent or any more important.please continue to bump this thread with your moronic personal attacks."
1/15/2010,"ok, so let's step back for a moment and look at the was and is, then.it used to be that, if some guy was spamming in local, you had to open your petitions screen, get to the relevant category, copypaste at least one line of the guy's spam, take note of the location, date and time of the offense, and the specific name of the person you were reporting. then you had to confirm it was the right person and click 'submit petition'.at this point, your computer could lock up for anything from seconds to minutes, for whatever unknown reason.the player would be able to continue spamming in local until such a time as action was taken against them. in order for their text to not flood your chat buffer, you had to then right click them and click 'block'.in order for your block list to not fill up to its 80 character limit, you'd have to (potentially carefully) sift through it to remove all the isk spammers while retaining people you want to keep blocked.all of these various processes could take you several minutes to complete for any one of them, but ultimately resulted in the offending character being removed.now, if someone is spamming isk selling sites, you right click -> report isk spammer -> confirm the name in the box and click 'yes'.the character is instantly reported with no locking up of your client at all. they are instantly essentially added to an invisible block list for at least you. their previous spam is removed from all text windows for at least you. you don't need to go manage your block list especially for that character at all.now, thing is, as with the previous isk spammers, if enough people report the same spammer, they will quickly get banned - reason for this being that as with the old petition method, the reports for any given character goes into a single 'file', based on the character name - get enough reports in one file and it gets knocked way up there in the queue of to-be-checked-out names.thus, removing it becomes far quicker.thus, ultimately, the character not only gets removed far quicker than it used to, but you are able to near-instantly remove all offending text from your chat windows, report the offending character and essentially 'block' them without the block list, nearly instantly.these result in the following:happier players since they waste less of their precious time and effort to report spammershappier gms since they get reports of spammers quicker than before as well as far more substantial evidence (i imagine that all text spammed by any given character is automatically included in the report - you know, all that text that gets removed from your chat windows)less frequent spammer attacks since they get swatted quicker than before and have to try and come on at peak times when they can get the most exposure now vs doing it non-stop all over the place, and players can report them easily and quickly even if they've already changed several systems since the character was spammingso yeah, unless you're sitting there in the offices with the gms responsible for banning isk spammers and can see them 'doing less since there's less pressure now', i don't think you can at all make such a claim; if anything, as they are receiving a multitude more fleshy reports now than before, i think the pressure has only increased with them.if spammers get blocked the way you say; ie: their text doesn't get removed for everyone, just you - then the gms still have to step in to take that character out of the game before more people are exposed to its spam that haven't yet reported it, the same way they had to do before the report function."
1/15/2010,"i suggest you don't report one and you'll notice that they're getting up to 70 or even 90 messages out.previously they were lucky to get past 15 messages.i'm simply bringing this to attention here as given the way the feature works, no one will ever complain, the feature will remain unimproved forever. at least with this small amount of discussion someone may think to further automate or improve the process.in it's current state no improvement will be made as it's a hidden problem with no complaints.a feature can be improved even if no one cares about it or notices there is an issue at all."
1/15/2010,"actually, i haven't had much of an opportunity to report isk spammers lately...i used to have almost one per day to report, with them passing through lustrevik or even piping up in rens - these days (besides the fact i'm hardly ever in either anymore), an isk spammer is such a rarity in either system that everyone talking in local or even watching it is surprised to see one.jita is, has and always will be one of the prime targets for isk spammers, because it's where a massive percentage of all the isk in eve goes. there is little to no way to 'automate' the detection, muting and subsequent banning of isk spammers that doesn't threaten to have an impact on general gameplay for legitimate players.if a filter is created, the guys running the bots will find a way around it. if limitations on the ability to talk in local are imposed, the bots will begin joining lists of player channels instead. if limitations on where trial accounts can join or talk are imposed, then there'll be a massively detrimental effect on the overall new-player community; more so than the current isk spammer issue.the 'issue' is not hidden by any means; the report isk spammer tool is merely a way for players to better maintain their side of the game to improve things for themselves.if you have any kind of magical function ccp could implement that couldn't/wouldn't have a negative impact on the playerbase as a whole that would remove isk spamming as a possibility entirely, then by all means, suggest it."
1/15/2010,why the hell would we want to not report an isk seller/spammer?seriously? what is your line of thinking? that's like saying there's a problem with gun control...so instead of locking the gun.... we should go ahead and shoot ourselves.for crying out loud... it's just a little bit obvious that your chat screen would get flooded by isk spammers... that's the whole reason the reporting feature was added... to get rid of it and bring it to the attention of ccp.you have a serious problem with your logic.... that or your drinking.seriously.... are you really that hard up to click your mouse just to turn the problem off?i'm starting to think you need a vacation.and if its really that big of a deal to you... spend less time whining about it... and more time coming up with a rational solution.
1/15/2010,"i have an alt in jita (as do most people). i rarely see isk spam anymore. rarely. adding a right-click will just allow people to falsely report someone else as an isk spammer and pull out the ""i was drunk and i meant to hit (whatever right click option would be above or below it)"". as it is now, when someone reports another player as a spammer, it is pretty clear they meant to."
1/15/2010,makes sense to me. trade grid for cpu. adds options based on having to make fitting decisions.
1/15/2010,"that is indeed the best course of action.we have a specific procedure in place for any complaints regarding isd members, and i can assure you all such issues are investigated fully.the gm team and the isd star team work closely together, and have a liaison to discuss any such issues with the respective teams. (currently this is me, however the liaison position is not fixed and may change to another gm at a future point in time).if you encounter any such problems, please file a petition under the game masters and isd category, and we will be able to look in to it."

1/15/2010,"agreed with a twist. i agree that it's a legit mini profession but if a straight up flag were put in place it would stop those from trying to work as salvagers. so how about this ... first two hours the wrecks are marked just like loot cans. color the wrecks accordingly so folks know that it's hands off unless you want an aggression flag thrown up. after that period the wrecks are free game and the color is switched to let folks know they're free game. wrecks after that two hour window are considered ""abandoned"" basically. oh and to boost the profession a bit more allow salvagers to scan down wrecks yeah?"

1/15/2010,"there's discussion on the topic of account security over in the assembly hall thread, ""provide services to improve account security.""i for one do not like the idea of limiting access by ip address or range, since that prevents me playing eve from friends places (or from the caravan down the coast when i'm on 3g wireless), and interferes with my game play when the isp changes the block of ip addresses that i might be connecting from.i would certainly like to see a ""last connected"" notice on the character selection screen (eg: ""last connected 10:45 gmt from 123.123.123.123"")."
1/15/2010,i want this topic to be brouth up as well 1. missions are designed badly.2. they were rushed with no testing and just dumped on tq3. they only hit gallente agents ( this one is my favorite )

1/16/2010,i support no insurance payouts on concord kills.
1/16/2010,"lol and you believe this?,other races are as good in missions as the caldari or even better.anyway im sure you think raven + its tiers concidered best for pve , oh and it doesnt have the ****ty kinetic only bonus what a coincidence."
1/16/2010,"i don't really understand the argument against removing the kinetic only bonus and replacing it with a rate of fire or all missile damage for caldari missile shipsi mean, a raven can do any damage type, does a lot of dps with torpedoes (granted cruise missiles blow right now), and is not considered to be overpoweredsomehow a caracal/kestrel/ect with a rate of fire bonus or damage to all bonuses, would be?where is the logic in that?the whole 'racial damage' thing is stupid, projectiles do a myriad of damage, minmatar do not get a bonus to damage types, nor does any other race, they get a bonus to their weapons, not the freaking ammo.. yes t2 resists are supposed to boost the ships defenses against their racial enemy and that's fine but still it's silly to say caldari should be the missile race and most of their ships only get a bonus to 1 out of 4 of missile types.so yes, caldari should have, depending on the ship, a bonus to rate of fire, missile damage, or both. honestly for most ships i'd be in favor of missile damage, as it conserves missiles gallente drone ships do not get a bonus to only thermal drones, yes they are generally the most favorable drone but they still are fully capable of fielding any type of drone and getting full bonusesminmatar ships do not get a bonus to only fusion ammo (mostly explosive) by the same argument as people are using against missiles you could easily say that minmatar should only receive their bonus when using explosive ammo or a gallente ship when using a thermal drone, but this is not the case, so why are caldari stuck with using 1 type of missile? why do we lose our ship bonus when we switch damage types to gain tactical advantage? missiles already have enough going against them in pvp, can we at least have our bonuses no matter which missile we use?oh well that's my two cents"
1/16/2010,"i actually avoid ravens at all costs cause i know how good they are....kinda like vagabonds. ships you know that if flown correctly will whip your ass.caracal and it's assault launchers would be a beast with rainbow damage against frigates. it already is! i really wish my thorax got bonused to a gun that shot light ammo like the caracal does.drone aregument kinda fails. note there are like 4? drone boats? and 1 (myrmidon) is slightly broken. so i fail to see how 3 ships really break the balance.minmatar get less damage, and fight in falloff. plenty of reason to give them sorta rainbow damage imo"
1/16/2010,because they are not arguing but trolling.
1/16/2010,"yes, you're right. because you fail to prove to me why this change should be implemented, and i keep providing counterpoints, i must be trolling. if you don't win, nobody wins. nice third grade attitude right there."
1/16/2010,"i do believe it and general consensus backs me up. drakes and the three raven based ships are extremely popular in the pve arena. the fact that raven does not have a kin-only bonus is a complete unrelated point since i was responding to a claim that caldari is underpowered as a whole.your point that raven, a ship with omni missile bonuses, is not imbalanced and thus every other ship will not be imbalanced with omni missile bonuses is blatantly fallacious.use the report button on the right and see what the moderators decide."
1/16/2010,"i like this idea.. but could be abused to allow criminals into hisec by acceptinga a mission, then using the time to wreak havok in hisec... there would need to be some safeguard to stop this, like for instance, if you warp anywhere except to the mission point, concord will still get you.and will the people arguing here stop it, this is not about making life harder for carebears, it isnt a hisec versus lowsec argument, it is for the sake and enjoyment of lowsec, making it a better playing environment for anyone who wants to live there. i dont care if hisec folks come to lowsec or not, i am interested in making lowsec enjoyable by itself."

1/16/2010,"totally agree. this is a much needed improvement. you can build t3s from sleeper salvage and gas polymers but you cant fit and change the subsystems within the whs. i'm sure it was just an oversight on ccp's part that this has occurred but it needs correcting sooner, rather than later.i also think a more substantial review of all things ""wormhole"" would be useful with the opportunity for those of us that have spent any length of time in whs to contribute these and other ideas."

1/16/2010,"i'd say this, combined with a variation of the original idea, have merit. i agree that target priorities for drones would be nice. i understand the viewpoint of the poster who made the sarcastic remarks about something similar for guns, however guns don't work like drones. for starters, there's no rigs to boost non-sentry damage, and there's no drone related implants.1: skill gives 2 targets per level, max of 10 at l5. sounds good.2: can prioritize based on hull/number, good. 3: i disagree with the ewar setting personally. that's getting just a little too fine-detailed on the settings. at that point you're almost programming your drones with an ai subroutine. no.4: tactical drone reconfiguration module (fleet drone tacticion module): this, and the pre-requisite skills, could be the key to giving motherships their own unique role. carriers can launch and assign fighters, but motherships can control the drones of the fleet. would make them unique. simply adjust the drone control link, which allows an extra drone per level, to instead let the mothership control up to 5 drones assigned to it. 5 of these, and the tactical module (functions similar to triage, however it gives bonuses to drones such as speed, hitpoints, etc. possibly damage, a bit iffy there.) and the mom can now control 25 drones from the fleet, and assign target priorities and a few sub-behaviors for groups.#4 is a combination of the op and the quote, and my thoughts on how to help balance this idea while giving a unique role to the mothership, instead of it being just a carrier mark 2. obviously leadership, advanced drone control, and possibly a new skill would be required for #4, but that's not a big stretch.i support the premise of the ideas, but there definitely needs to be more discussion on the exact details and numbers, as well as how the proposal would effect game balance."
1/16/2010,"i did one of these the other day with a friend. he is only doing l1's and got this. i'm l4 for 6 months.it took bloody ages in his crappy ship approaching an hour. he's not too good either. i didn't fight just kept an eye on local.after 45 minutes in comes a group attempting to tackle. luckily my agony experience meant we were off grid before any consequence but they just sat there knowing they were griefing the mission.then you come to the mission rewards. including travel time it took over two hours. so theoretically between the two of us (one mission runner, one monitoring local etc your going to need to earn about 150 mil plus at level 4. or if solo you'd have to factor in losing a ship a fair few times again at level 4 with a caldari fit you'd probably need close to 300 mil. make your own call on level one average earnings.all we got was an implant work about 30k and some pathetic bounty. not even some faction loot.missions are all about the isk/hour. this is totally useless.i think i might of seen this concept before. oh yes level 5 missions. any takers anyone?more of the increasing threat to force pve players into pvp.why do people play pve well because some really like it and play eve to do just that. it ain't broke stop trying to fix it. there are two worlds the pve and the pvp. there is already enough overlap there called salvaging theiving....."

1/16/2010,as a long term director in a corp this has my fullest support.
1/16/2010,omg yes!
1/16/2010,"lacking a better term for the title, this proposal has to do with the character transfer mechanics, specifically what happens when you log into the web based account management page. this does not have to do with the sale or method of sale of characters; it is only dealing with what happens after you have provided a credit card number to ccp for transferring a character to another account.this proposal is to address two issues: 1) helping to simplify and identify characters who have been transferred from one account to another2) help with some cleanup on the character datapart 1)i'm proposing that when you transfer a character, (legally, via the ccp approved method via their website), ccp does not place the character immediately into the new account. instead, ccp transfers the character to a ccp corp. (""concord pilot relocation services"", or some other such role-playable corp name.) after spending 10 seconds in this ccp corp, it is then transferred to the proper account specified in the transfer section of the web transfer services page.by spending 10 seconds in ""concord pilot relocation services"" indicates that the character was sold, and has a time/date stamp in their in-game employment history to prove such. part 2)regarding the character data cleanup, i think it would be helpful if while in the ""concord pilot relocation services"", the character got a clean slate. i propose that at that time, during the character transfer process, should the original owner choose to*, the following things happened:all bookmarks deletedall buddies deletedall block lists deletedall personal standings towards anyone zero'd out or null'dall kill rights (to/for) nullifiedall eve-mails are deleted (except agent)all eve-mail notifications are deleted (except agent)all combat logs deletedpretty much a general clearing out of the people and places section of hte character.agents and other non-player data can stay put.*note* wallet history and contracts are not part of the cleaning.regarding the ""should the original owner choose to"", i would imagine a checkbox on ccp's character transfer page allowing the original owner the choice of clearing out this data or not.[ ] clean out people and places during character transfer?[ ] do not clean out people and places. leave data alone. (if i missed anything else you can think of for deletion, please feel free to suggest it.)i think these two things would help the remaining players know when a character sale has happened in someone's past, and provide a clean-slate to the new owner of the character.i don't see any side-effects from this, as once a character is transferred, it's no longer in your control. we're making that publicly transparent and removing any liability of that from you.hopefully, other people see this as a good thing and vote it up.respectfully,cyrus ageis*edit* typos*2nd edit* spoke with a csm rep regarding this proposal. had to modify it a bit. turns out that ccp doesn't allow a char transfer via it's web page without the char in question being in an npc corp anyways. removed the part about dropping roles. also, clarified the people and places cleanup portion, with an option on the transfer page to clear/not clear the data on transfer, making this an optional step."
1/16/2010,"supported, of course."
1/16/2010,as a network technician for an isp (irl) i would love to hear you elaborate on this?(i could use a good laugh)
1/16/2010,yes please.please give us the option of using a hardware based authenticator.
1/16/2010,after playing for 4 years i dont want anybody non ccp to be able to get acess to my account.and if where on it:i want my avatar to be flagged unsaleable and locked to this account.
1/16/2010,"this proposal is about several things:1st: making it easier to understand what the hell is going on for noobs.2nd: making it look cooler and more cinematic for someone who is just watching a fight but has never played eve. 3rd: making it more eye-candy and epealing for everybody.4th: making it easy to understand what the hell is going on withought looking on the overview and reading notifications. those where my goals. if i have not quite achieved them, please point out the holes and let's work on improving the proposal together, because i think they are worthy. so, first of all, somehing that bothered me for really long time: if someone shot my interceptor with an ammar dread, and missed, can i actually have him miss, instead of having a beam 5 times the size of my ceptor burning my ship for 10 seconds and my ship staying absolutely intact? yes, this means if the shot did not do any damage and missed, then the shot goes away somewhere next to the ship into deepness of space. in my personal opinion that would grately improve visuals for those flying smaller ships in bigger battles, as no longer wil an assault frigate speed tanking a bunch of npc's become invisible under the sheer amount of missiles and plasma that all hit the same spot on a tiny ship. if i fire as a ship and miss, my shot goes into darknes of space. if i shoot with a weapon group and barely scratch, dealing 1/4 normal damage, then only 2 out of 8 guns hit, the rest will miss. this required no adjustment server side, as your client already knows who missed and who hit you, all we need is an animation (not that much of an animation anyway, should be rather easy to do). i am not a game developer, so i might be wrong on this, but... the second thing- when i shoot a titan with barrage of 8 missiles, all missiles do not just go and all hit the same window. i know that we are trying to make a hole in the ship, but when a 100 bs launch 8 missiles each, and all 800 missiles start hitting the same window, it looks wired. another request would be to add a tick to remove self effects. what this means is i wil not see armor hardeners, sensor boosters or any other non-remote effect modules activated on any ship except mine, yet i will see everything else. this si more of a lag improvement, but in a large fight i really don't care if someone is sensor boosting, and will remove alot of strain from my pc without damaging the overall look of the game much. missile hardpoint, and missile launchers. get us missiles coming from different sides of the ship, instead of all coming outta same spot. in my personal opinion warp scrambling effect needs to be much more vivid. maybe we could have an option for this. afterburners and microwarpdrives. can we please have animations, and different animations for a microwarpdrive and an afterburner. this is both for the sake of eye-candiness and for the sake of clarity, i want to know what my enemy is using, currently i cannot see anything. well, last thing is drones can we please have the drones shoot a ship while the guns are facing it. yes, i would like the drones to orbit a ship with them facing the ship, and the thruster looking the opposite direction. looks stupid when guns fire sideways. might not be important, but should be rather easy to do. how are they gonna turn? vectored thrusting. also maybe we could have both drone guns fire simultaneously, so it looks a bit better. that is all for now, if you have more ideas or you have found some holes, please tell me, i will adjust the suggestion according to whant discussion comes to.suggested by burseg sardaukar"
1/16/2010,missiles visual effects are boring... i'd love to see it overhauled.. and yeah from multiple points of the ship would be nice.. its lame the way it is
1/16/2010,"i am all for more realism in the visuals, supported.it's not like the eve client is a very demanding client and i feel that ccp is slipping away from the former glory of ""the best loooking mmo""."
1/16/2010,support: useful function. never did like the way it just boots you without warning.
1/16/2010,"1. because not everyone has the schedule to wait for other ppl's schedules to match perfectly to gather a large enough gang and outblob any possible gate camps on the way. neither do they want to split the rewards among the large gang either, unlike a pirate's killmail, which everyone gets.2. gangs have scan probes.3. refer to #2. they can still find u, local or not. that's due to the incompetence of the gankers, which is why this proposal was made--u just don't understand that other players r not rats. they don't log on for u to shoot fish in a barrel with. but if they were hunting u down as well, u wouldn't have to track them down and complain about it, would u? or r u only aiming for targets u can ez with no effort required? because u can still ambush someone in the destination system without any warning otherwise. it won't do much to alliance assets like everyone else seems to ""suggest"", but as usual, it looks like u're only after easy kills anyway."
1/16/2010,keep one looking over their shoulder
1/16/2010,"just go in wormholes :) they are there for you waiting.full of excitement , treasures and the gank you want :)end of storry."
1/16/2010,"where did you hear me say the word 'unescorted'? freightering through 0.0 is 'interesting' enough as it is, no need to make it an even bigger timesink.oh wow, a combat probe. ok, 4 carriers, a dread, a paladin, 3 sbs, rapier, arazu and a load of bs and bc. sure, the carriers and dread are probably in a pos, the pala is probably running anoms, but what about the rest? 'hello, any pirate in here?'well, same goes for everyone i guess :) providence has so many blues, neutrals and reds it's hard enough to tell them apart already, if you're not in one of the bigger alliances there.there's no way you're realistically going to be able to have a modicum of safety if you can't tell red from neutral at a glance. just imagine flying through high-sec, knowing everyone in local can come at you at any time but without the red and blue markers. imagine, one in 20 times you undock or jump, you lose a ship because you have no way of knowing the probable intentions of those 20 or 30 there with you in system, the only certainty you have is, they are out there, and out to get you...you can't lock down gates, you can only hunt and hope to get, but not in your isk making machines. i haven't seen a single argument that would give ratters, miners or haulers more survivability, i can really only see ways for gankers to get free kills.i'm specifically not going into pvp (as the above is pvbarreledfish), because every time i see hostiles roaming and we get some response fleet the hostiles turn around and flee, just like the ratters they were trying to gank flee as soon as they think they're in danger. the roaming gang (or solo pirate with alt, or whatever) has as much to gain from local as intel tool as the cannon fodder they're so eager to gank.i see w-space mentioned a lot as a prime example of why 'it would work in 0.0'. well, not in my opinion. ""but ppl in w-space have proven they can survive too!!!11one"". true, _but_... they choose to go there, they willingly take the risk, and they are semi-protected / left alone because their gates have to be scanned down and disappear all the time. if w-space is soo great a) by all means, go there, i won't stop you and b) why isn't everyone there?eve is a sandbox, and different aspects of eve attract different types of ppl. if you drastically change some important parameter (and removing local as intel tool is just that, a major change) you will upset the balance, and i am absolutely certain this change will not lead to ccps stated goal: more ppl in 0.0, as the only ones not in 0.0 are either carebears that are already hesitant to risk their ship or pod (which will happen to them in 0.0, doubly so without local) or ppl in w-space, and why would they come back? more risk for less gains for them..."
1/16/2010,supported on the basis that ccp will have something replace the constant spamming of the d-scanner that you get in w-space.
1/16/2010,"earlier i posted a proposal with two bundled changes. one change was well received, the other wasn't. so now i'm reposting the ""good"" one alone.with quantum rise unguided missiles (rockets, hams and torps) were nerfed among other things in their ability to hit small targets, i.e. their explosion radius was increased. but even before qr they were already penalized in that they don't receive the explo radius bonus from the guided missile precision skill. now they are penalized twice in the same area. among other things this has led to unguided missiles under-performing and having low popularity. there's a reason why rockets are currently also being called ""roflkets"". a small buff is needed and would be welcome by many, so without further ado i propose:change the ""guided missile precision"" skill into ""missile precision"", meaning all missiles get the explosion radius bonus, not only the guided ones."
1/16/2010,"is this really a big issue? people seem to be using them all the time, so is this a necessary change or just a whine about the good old days? i'm not a regular missile user, so i haven't been keeping up with the missile issues. rockets sucking isn't a reason to do this though. it is just a reason to boost rockets."
1/16/2010,you can speed torps to 60% dmg with a mega without any propulsion mod. while the blasters wouldnt be affected too badly.
1/16/2010,"can require a bit of balancing in other stats, but supported."
1/16/2010,"then you should read up on it the new speed paradigm combined with the unguided missiles lack of skill support, makes them incredibly midslot hungry as you need painter+web+scramble (mwd killer) to apply the full damage. this goes for both hams and torps.@op: supported with a caveat - they need to be tweaked to avoid them becoming god weapons when/if full tackle is acquired (ex. torpedo ravens and ham drakes can be immensely powerful as is when they make the midslot sacrifices)."
1/16/2010,"emphasis mine. why shouldn't they be powerful when they give up tank? isn't that a major part of this game, to find the right balance between tank and gank?"
1/16/2010,"problem: mining ships have almost no tank. a ship specifically constructed for mining in space would not be expected to have much in the way of armor or shields, as these are very combat specific ship attributes. however, you would expect ships built to handle tons of dense ore to be solidly build, as in, they should have some structure. unfortunately, this is not the case.solution: greatly increase the structure of all ships built by ore (2-3 times as much). this will not greatly effect ehp in most setups, as people will still choose to maximize their mining ability by using all low slots towards that. however, people who choose to fit a damage control will have a nice level of ehp to make the compromise worth it. sustained tanking would continue to be shield based, as is now. it allows for mining ship fits with a decent level of buffer tank at the expense of mining ability, unlike currently."
1/16/2010,and then you start a process of teaching every miner to fit a damage control?more structure doesnt make sense without the dc.has about 25k ehp. needs a 5% cpu implant.
1/16/2010,currently shield extenders and invuls provide a resonable hp buff. however i would not mind increasing hp to let ore ships withstand high-sec smartbombs. i am neutral by large on this.
1/16/2010,"this may be true, but more structure would make sense for something that looks so friggen bulky and takes so long to aligni support this."
1/16/2010,"that is exactly the point. players who choose to use a dc in their lows instead of a mining related module have the chance for a much more effective buffer which doesn't effect sustainable defense. without the additional structure, mining ships are very limited into the size of the buffer they can have. enhanced structure makes sense for a rugged mining ship, as opposed to increasing shields or armor."
1/16/2010,"supported, although ships and cans should be excluded, and there'd have to be some sort of method for handling damaged drones and modules. also, it should be optional, probably something under esc -> general settings."
1/16/2010,.
1/16/2010,"dear ccp,early this morning an epin battle unfolded in jc- between large forces of various factions. unfortunately it failed to unfold completely and was then miserably crumbled down into lag and failure by the almighty hamsterhand. this was the kind of battle that, if it had gone well, would have been great pr for eve as a game: hundreds of people and thousands of $ of equivalent real life isk involved in a big battle with lots of pretty explosions as a result.with apocrypha you did a great job of improving on the lag problem in fleet fights however it seems like dominion took all that, spat on it, and flushed it down the toilet.proposal: fix this shizzle- sok.ps. logged back in with 70% shields on my lev, f. yeah"

1/16/2010,"your right... i don't know you.but what i do know of you is you emo-rage post topic titles ""omg ccp set us up the bomb"" and people are going to wonder what the hell is your problem? first impressions really do count.maybe it should be ""issue: serious lag problem with fleet fights!""saying ""fix ur game"" comes across as some foolish little 5 year old throwing a tantrum making demands to ccp whom is not likely reading this (aside from moderation) and when some common average joe pilot shows up and finds out your a csm.... he's going to wonder if its just a bunch of whiny kids who can't be arsed to spell/speak english decently and spends all of its time whining and raging over a problem (albeit legit) and you being csm you'd think its a bit of a foolish notion to demand something when your supposedly the conduit to get that issue raised up to begin with.so yeah... what little i do know.... not impressive to be sure."
1/16/2010,"sokratesz: i am not sure you can really say ""they are not taking it seriously"". there were a big testing round early in january no? the silence afterwards isnt nice, but might be a sign that the problem is harder than expected.did tri participate in the testing? in caod they were just joking, that it would be the best time to attack nc.pls titan losses, well they havent learned from the mistakes of wi. it isnt that wi didnt whine enough in caod and other places.all in all.would it be nice that ccp would give some feedback on the progress? yesdoes it need more threads about it? no."

1/16/2010,"confirming that this is:a) not caod (phew, but why the epic caod memes?), b) battle was epin c) in the entire 2 hours of fighting, i laid down a whooping 4k damage as mods set with auto-repeat off, auto repeated for 2 hours. d) lollerskates at people smacking sok in *this* forum, 3/10 way to dissolve the powers of csm, people that are your voice to ccp (*golf clap*)e) love this game, but its so ******ed at times.you can pay me in corp dictors sok, i've come into help whip the welps/trolls."
1/16/2010,"hello,we in the wormhole community have been mulling over this idea for a while now and i'm sure k-space miners (and likely pirates too :p) will love it as much as i and everyone else have loved the idea. so here it goes:develop an ore faction control tower (small, med and large...or at least large) with bonuses to either:1. refine wastage percentageor2. cpu and power requirements of refinery array equipmentnow obviously there has to be some sort of downside to being so industry awesome. i propose that the towers just have no bonuses to defenses like normal towers do. but this is open to discussion of course.this would provide the needed industry love ccp needs to give us and! a nice fat juicy target for harvesting care bear tears for those pirate-y types :d"
1/16/2010,this would def be interesting ....a .25% bonus ... to max out the refining
1/16/2010,anything that possibly increases wormhole traffic/life is good for my killboard.c5's are too empty imo
1/16/2010,i like the idea.the issue i see is that ccp may want to keep refining levels low to force players to decide to take the lower return on refining or go back to a stationed system. similar to the decision to give the rorqual the ability to compress ore instead of refine.
1/16/2010,perhaps maybe give the ore tower the ability to compress? i'd be content with that as well.
1/16/2010,"well i did not want to increse traffic, i like my ""fairly"" quiet piece of eve ... i just wanted a refining bonus ... i get enough random traffic in the c3 i currently occupie ... an exit opens mostly to low sec, occationally to null sec and once every couple weeks to a high sec exit ... with one exit bouncing around between more locus space and the occational null space exit ..."
1/16/2010,"i like the idea also. altho i think a more substantial review of all things ""wormhole"" would be useful with the opportunity for those of us that have spent any length of time in whs to contribute these and other ideas."
1/16/2010,"numbers need tweaking, but good idea."
1/16/2010,i like this idea.
1/16/2010,interesting idea. i like it. maybe boost the max refinery effeciency to 90% on the intensive array. to have a middle ground between normal pos and outpost/npc refinery.
1/16/2010,nice idea
1/16/2010,supported so long as its balanced.

1/16/2010,"it would appear that with the dominion patch, more than ever are we experiencing large fleet fights of 1000+ pilots. while both player and developer alike are enchanted by the thought of large internet spaceships reducing each other to slag en masse, these fights are also come with a deeper, more personal, and much less glamorous struggle that has ended more ships than anything during these large, server-breaking fights:the struggle to get the damn grid to load while your ship sits helpless and targetable.as it stands, a player who has jumped or jump bridged into a loaded system and especially into a grid during which a battle is taking place, system and grid both take a very long time to load (usually never loading). in the meanwhile, the ship that player is flying appears on grid, but since the player cannot see or do anything (as he hasn't loaded grid yet) the ship is left vulnerable and can be shot down without incident by anyone who is already on grid. since a defending force is usually already sitting on grid waiting for the attacker, this puts them at a very solid advantage as they have already loaded grid and can shoot down the ships of an attacker before the offending pilots even load grid. while this is a solid slap in the face to ccp's usual ""lag affects both sides equally"" statement, and also brings into question a number of networking issues that ought to be resolved, this isn't the point of this post as ccp is already trying to resolve it's network issues, such that those efforts are.instead the goal is to address this specific problem, being that a ship belonging to a pilot appears on grid and is vulnerable before the pilot himself loads grid and can actually do anything, leaving it defenseless when it should be otherwise participating in battle and defending itself. to correct this, i would propose not displaying the ship or it's warpin/jumpin animation until after grid has been loaded. while this doesn't solve any netcode issues and people may still get stuck loading grid, at least they won't have to worry about their ship blowing up while they're stuck. once that persons grid has loaded, then the server can display their ship and they can participate happily in the fight."
1/16/2010,"yes, altho this should only be a temporary solution till the grid load issue is fixed.i experienced the issue once myself, and many times where fleet members had it."
1/16/2010,"if it is even possible to code, then that would be the most elegant solution of all.perhaps make ships visible/probable but invulnerable. an indefinite gate-cloak seems a little ""meh"" and would benefit an attacker/jumper far more,"
1/16/2010,supporting a fix to an issue i hae not personally experienced but has still gotten significant negative coverage outside of the eve community.[edit] supporting something i support.
1/16/2010,this... is something that's troubled me for some time now...never experienced it but i would rather not experience it.you'd think there would be some sort of communication between the server and the client to be able to indicate you've loaded onto the grid.but potentially there could be an exploit here as well.supporting with caution.
1/16/2010,the issue i see here is that you would have fleets loading grid piecemeal and becoming visible in small groups. you might take 2 minutes to load grid but your fleet mate may take 1 minute. he's dead long before you get the grid loaded and become a viable target. this would effectively act as a nice force multiplier for any fleet that you jumped into.-no
1/16/2010,"supporting, although i don't see how this would be possible to code the way the devs have described the engine."
1/16/2010,an elegant solution but i fear it will be difficult for the server to objectively determine whether or not a client is 'ready'
1/16/2010,"assuming the grid takes ages to load because of server side delay in computing & sending all the grid info to the client, it's very easy to determine when the grid loaded: after all grid info was sent to the client."
1/16/2010,"from what i gathered in the past it is usually the client that is unable to keep up with the server. loading all the decals and models for example, and working out all the gfx effects. that also explains certain weird behavioural thingies experienced under heavy lag, such as drones doing full damage over time for the server even though they show as doing nothing for the client.either way, if they can make it work in a fair way, it would be awesome hence why i support it :)"
1/16/2010,"this would mean that turning all effects off and setting graphics to minimum would reduce the chance of getting grid load lag or reduce the time it takes to load the grid. this hasn't been confirmed yet.what has indeed occurred is that client side performance (as in fps) dropped. if that is or isn't related to grid load also hasn't been confirmed. interesting enough, the grid load bug only seems to appear after jumping or portaling, never when warping to a blob.you can speculate if this is a new form of desync. just to exemplify: it takes some time to compute the subset data (the grid) and send it to the client. if this takes too long, the simulation advances in the meantime, hence new updates have to be computed and sent. this is possible as the server code seems to not process each request with a strict first come first server priority order (ever noticed that under extreme lag movement commands are responded to more quickly than say, ammo change?). if the client waits until it is in sync with the current simulation tick, it makes complete sense that it fails ever to become ""ready"" if the server is under high load and takes too long for each update."
1/16/2010,good idea!
1/16/2010,"i was always for drone damage mods.. i see a number of issues..first of al, what stops a domi fitting 6 small mods? will they affect only drones according to their sise? then what is vexor supose to do,since it controls large drones as well. although they are easelly fixable. no stacking penalty for them please, because in effect they work like a gun."
1/16/2010,"with no stacking a dominix using sentries could almost do close range bs level damage at sniper ranges or an ishkur could almost double its drone output, lets not go there eh? @op: how do you propose to handle balancing if practically any high-slot can be used? wouldn't it be better to restrict it to utilities and add 1-2 to various ships?"
1/16/2010,"while not a bad idea in itself there's no mention of the cons as well as the pros, who it would affect or how the mechanics would be implemented. as such it is an idea not a proposal that could be voted on.given the dire state of 0.0 lag, rockets and some other aspects why should this get dev time over fixing fleet warfare timer bugs or some other majorly broken mechanic?that said i'd be happy to see this mechanic implemented, especially if it made ganking cnr's easier :) it would have no major impact on how much isk you can make from a mission because anyone seriously running missions for isk doesn't warp out anyway.mwd's are not allowed in dead space because it would make speed tanking too easy and there's various issues around greifing too that are not mentioned in the opgiven that sleeper ai is the way ccp are moving forwards in terms of npc'c you're not going to get the change to npc tracking that would be required for mwd use.debated and discussed many times before so it's safe to say that we'd all like to see stuff like this. ccp has the get out of jail free card that it runs on a single server so they have to impose limitations beyond those of other mmogs but it'll be interesting to see what happens once more single server mmogs get off the ground.on the assumption that the op isn't a troll, the op is lacking the experience to educate others about the full implications of the proposal and lacks the maturity to learn from others."
1/16/2010,"even though this mainly helps people not get ganked i see this topic from both sides of the argument.'i don't want to get ganked' while doing a site and 'i hope they don't see my probes' as i lock them down.as a wormhole dweller i have been on both sides of this situation equally, we (my corp) regularly run sites in our home system and neighboring wormhole systems.at the same time and more often i have been the one at the controlling side of the scan probes looking to lock down an unfortunate.the idea i'm posting is simple and possibly mentioned before.make all scan probes an option in overview filter types, this way less clutter is shown on directional scan if profiles are made properly.it may also reduce lag as less items are needed for directional, especially if you are within range of multiple pos's.more based from a wormhole point of view, it will help in highsec,lowsec, 0.0 and any future systems where local is not an immediate intel piece.--------------though it may be necessary to introduce an increased scan time for filtered options, after all your onboard computer has more to worry about."

1/16/2010,htis is absolutely nessesary.
1/16/2010,as a wormhole resident pve/pvp'er i fully endorse this ideachronos
1/16/2010,"i've strongly supported this for a long time. watching for probes is basically a requirement, yet the process is made very frustrating by what i think is a poor mechanic. while the time required can be mitigated by sorting the results, it is still very common to have to sift through dozens of containers, pos modules, etc. the new probing system allows one to filter out extraneous results with a great deal of granularity. i wish the same could be said for the directional scanner. at the very least, can we get an option for setting the scanner to remember the index of a highlighted result to avoid having to scroll down again on every single scan?"
1/16/2010,"problem: currently, losing implants is one of the main fears newer players or carebears have about trying pvp. they might be willing to lose their frig, cruiser, bc, or bs, but their +2s, +3s, +4s, or +5s are not something they are willing to risk. jump clones offer a possibility to avoid this loss, but the 24 hour timer doesn't make it convenient for someone to try pvp without prior planning. however, removing the timer would make jump clones overpowered as a tool to move around the universe.proposal: implement a new type of clone, called an implant clone. there are no standings required for use. an implant clone allows you to switch to a new clone (for an isk fee). your clone with implants gets left in the station, and you get a brand new blank clone. this can be done instantly, and you can switch back to your clone with implants whenever you wish. however, when you switch back, your blank clone is destroyed. you can only switch between the implant/blank clone in-station, to prevent it from being used as a quick transport mechanism.what it would do: now, if someone wants to try some low-sec or wh pvp, they don't have to worry about losing implants, getting a jump clone, etc... it removes significant barriers to entry for players who wish to attempt the pvp lifestyle. more players trying pvp can only be beneficial for eve in the long term."

1/16/2010,"i fly a rook very little and think it would be really fun, but there is a huge problem with it. it targets out to 180 but has nothing that can reach that far. ecm is only good out to about 53 before ecm fall-off. heavy ii missles only go out to about 90 at the most. my question. why is the rook so underpowered? blackbird ecm range is better and the ship is a whole lot cheaper. it makes no since to fly a rook, especially when you can fly a scorpion for alot less. my isk was wasted buying an inferior ship. please see what you can do do help the rook out. thanks."
1/16/2010,"short version: rook and falcon: 30%/level jamming strength bonus. scorpion and blackbid: 15%/level jamming strength bonuslong version: you might consider the wee fact that maybe long-range ecm is not the rook's forte, and that it gets phenomenal dps for an ecm ship when loaded with hams. even without a single ecm boosting module on it, you can still get 4 racials with 11.25 jam strength, 424 dps, and 19k ehp without even trying hard. if you want long-range ecm, go for the scorpion. if you want cost-effective ecm, get a blackbirdlearn to fit the ship to the niche role before making a complaint thread in the assembly hall. the rook has good dps, and more jamming strength than any other ecm boat. the scorpion has very long range ecm, but has less jamming strength. the blackbird is the cheap ship, far more easily replaced than either of the above. don't complain to us because you can't figure out how to use the ship properly."
1/16/2010,"when you get accustomed to using ecm you will invariably be sitting as far out as is possible while remaining effective.long targeting range means near immunity to sensor dampeners which can be a godsend as it is the only ""reliable"" counter to ecm besides raw firepower.it is a good thing that the boats are now different, want range you go t1, want staying power or cloak you go t2 .. apart from ecm mechanic being a snooze fest when smaller numbers/hulls are involved the ecm ships are better balanced than they have ever been."

1/16/2010,"this proposal includes two parts:1) change the ""guided missile precision"" skill into ""missile precision"", meaning all missiles get the expl. radius bonus, not only guided. this would be the much needed and welcome buff to roflkets, hams and torps. their base expl. radius is already penalized, there is no reason they don't get the benefit of the skill.2) add a skill that also gives turrets a sig. radius bonus. it is unclear why there isn't such a skill already, given that guided missiles have it. some sr turrets will need some rebalancing for their base sig. radius, but this can be discussed/should be tested out by ccp if implemented."
1/16/2010,"2. we call that motion prediction, which does exactly the same."
1/16/2010,"that is incorrect. motion prediction gives bonus to tracking (compensates for target angular velocity), which is loosely equivalent to target navigation prediction for missls (compensates target absolute velocity). there is no skill that decreases sig. radius for turrets."
1/16/2010,turrent damage isnt that badly depending on the sigradius as missiles are. last time i checked.e.g. turrets can still even one volley (npc) frigs. try the same with missiles.
1/16/2010,yes for missiles change. not sure if the turrets need sig radius skill. i am neutral on that.
1/16/2010,"the missiles that most need the explosion radius bonus (unguided missls), aren't affected by the skill.which ships are you talking about? even a 4-5mi sp caldari char can one-volley most npc frigs and destroyers with hmls.all guided t1 missles have the same base sig. radius as their turret counterparts (correction: cruise missls even have 300m vs. 400m for the turrets), and they get the benefit of the skill.i'd like to see lr turrets getting the same benefit. as for sr turrets, i was suggesting a small nerf to sig radius to compensate for the introduction of the skill, bringing it in line with the sr unguided missls.yes i know, the proposal has ramifications and requires some rebalancing. as for proposal 1) i think its very fair, since after the missl nerf, the skill effect (which was the previous penalty to unguided missls), wasn't revised, iirc."
1/16/2010,i was talking about bs size weapons.sorry for being unclear.what makes it pretty hard to agree with your proposal:you mixed 2 related but different proposals into one. you would mostlikely get lots of agreement on the missile part. but the turret part seems unneeded.
1/16/2010,"ok. look at cruise missiles for instance, they have a 300m sig vs. 400m for turrets, and they still get the benefit of the skill.i did both in one proposal because i think that you can't implement one without the other, or you'll create an imbalance.i can see why you think they shouldn't be together, as one is a buff to unguided missls, the other a buff to lr turrets. yet both are based around balancing towards the same thing (guided missls already get the skill benefit, sr turrets aren't penalized)."
1/16/2010,yeah but correct me if i am wrong. for turrets the sigradius only matters for tracking. not for the actual hitting dmg. and motion prediction improves your tracking no?
1/16/2010,"you are mistaken. sig res is unrelated to tracking. if your guns sig res is bigger then the targets sig res, you'll be doing less damage. tracking is related to your targets angular velocity (i.e. with increased angular velocity you hit for less when approaching/passing your guns tracking amount)."
1/16/2010,"actually he was correct, which is also the reason why i made my first post. the only thing affected by the sig radius of a gun is its effective tracking. so motion prediction effectively already does exactly the same. the damage a turret will do agaisnt a target where tracking isnt an issue is completely independent of the sig radius of the target and the gun, unlike missiles."
1/16/2010,"i'm inclined to disagree with the turret proposal.sig radius on guns vs. target effects damage.tracking effects accuracy(to the best of my knowledge, not damage).guns have a random variable in there somewhere, i say this as a gun user.explosion radius on missiles vs. sig radius of target effects damage.targets velocity vs. explosion velocity effects damage.missile damage is almost static from volley 1, unless target changes speed/sig, i say this as my alt uses missiles, and i have caldari friends who have also confirmed this.missiles aren't effected by angular velocity or tracking. they always hit, however any movement at all reduces damage, even if 0 angular, ie: target moving directly towards you.i don't have enough experience or knowledge about unguided missiles to really say one way or another."
1/16/2010,"this is the overall hit chance formula for turrets. both turret tracking and the target radius/sig res ratio influence hit chance. but turret users can only improve tracking via skill.for missls a different formula is used. tracking vs. target angular velocity is replaced by target velocity vs. missl velocity, target radius/sig res remains the same. but missile users can improve both via skill.this is incorrect. as long as the target isn't stationary (in that case hit chance tends towards 1 anyway) target res/sig res has an influence. the formula corroborates this.yes, but when you average multiple shots (some hit well, some not) the effect is a reduction of dps.yes, i know."
1/16/2010,"now if you would have bothered reading the tracking formula you would have read that sig radius of guns and target only affects tracking of your gun, nothing else. so if tracking isnt an issue, guns deal full damage.and since they only affect tracking, motion prediction does exactly the same."
1/16/2010,"the name ""tracking formula"" is a misnomer. it is a hit chance formula, in which tracking and sig radius/sig res are an input parameter. both parameters have influence, as they interact in a multiplicative way. only one can be improved by skill.to demonstrate, let's use a numerical example:- gun with 0.05 tracking, 20000m optimal, 400m sig res- target at 20000m, 250m/s traversal, 250m sig radiusinserting those values into the formula gives a hit chance of 89.5%.now if we increase target sig radius to 400m or decrease gun sig res to 250m, hit chance becomes 95.7%.the only moment tracking isn't an issue is when both attacker and target are stationary relative to each other.in the missile formula explosion radius and explosion velocity are also related in a multiplicative way, even if less directly. both can be improved by skill."
1/16/2010,#NAME?
1/16/2010,explosion velocity and radius skills of missiles have different effects. adding a skill that reduces sig radius of guns would have exactly the same effect as motion prediction.
1/16/2010,"that is indeed true. you could simply double the bonus per skill of motion prediction to achieve the same effect, but i don't think that is a good idea as you'd also have to double skilling time and you wouldn't be able to apply the bonus to only lr guns. also true, but in the end both skills help get higher damage on targets that are smaller than exp. radius and faster than exp. velocity, while for turrets you only have this one +5% per level skill. the hit chance formula is kinda lame tbh for not differentiating between tracking and sig res."
1/16/2010,"things you forget:- you can speed tank missiles with flying straight away/to the ship ever tried that with a turret boat? tachydon one volley frigates. - missiles got consistently lowered dmg from speed tanking. turrets still got the chance of getting wrecking/full hits in. of course from the perception with looking at the dmg messages it will look like ""i constantly get crap hits!"". but i am sure the average isnt that bad. the real effective dps applied to the target is situational.all in all i am not really sure this proposal is needed at all. sorry."
1/16/2010,"correct, but turrets also get less average dps as soon as the target isn't in optimal while for missiles it stays the same across the whole range.well yes, that's the beauty of the different weapon systems. each is subject to different factors and thus have different strengths and weaknesses.thats ok, it's not like i can't be convinced otherwise in a good discussion.i will still open a new proposal thread for proposal 1), as it seems quite a few like it and were only not supporting it because of the tied proposal 2)."

1/17/2010,"i don't think you've thought this through as well as you believe.first -- you're masking issues that are better addressed in other ways than using insurance fraud as a cover.a mission runner can pull more mineral income than a mining pilot. *i* got 778 megacyte from level 1 missions when i switched corporations to mission run for a couple days. not level 4's -- level 1 mission recycling.run a single mission as fast as you can, loot everything, head to a base and recycle it all. this is where the bulk of your lowsec/nullsec ores come from in highsec and you sure as hell aren't making a lot of anything without those higher end ores -- which your miners are *not* getting in highsec.if the bottom drops out of the lowest end minerals, who does that hurt? if the bottom keeps dropping on the higher end minerals -- who gets hurt? if trit doubles in price, the impact on low end ship manufacturing will be trivial when 1 megacyte is equal to over 1,000 trit against the cost of manufacturing.*think* about it... it's not the low end crap that makes it possible to make the ships so cheaply. it's the lower costs on the higher end ores and those are *not* being mined in vast amounts by your highsec miners yet it keeps showing up in larger and larger volumes on the market.where's this supply coming from? not miners...yes -- i support this idea."
1/17/2010,"yup, suicide ganking is too profitable atm. and it's not like this would make the tactic obsolete."
1/17/2010,"how is suicide ganking risk free ? it is penalty guaranteed is as much as you will soon be movement restricted or spending considerable time in npc 0.0 (again risky) grinding up standings.you are disingenuously considering financial loss as the the sole factor of risk, and as has been previously explained, the reason there is currently no real financial risk is due to over production of minerals by a largely afk hisec population."
1/17/2010,"i think you are mistaken me to support ganks. i do not. at least not in the way it just happens. after dominion a hulk cost nearly 200 million isk. how long would a person who play just the economical part of the game need to afford this? with a retriever 2 month?imho it would be only fair and realistic if the same amount of time would be necessary for a ganker to do such a thing. technically i have no problem with the ganking itself. just with the considerable timeloss you have. how can it be possible for 4 people save 4 times 600k to buy 4 catalyst and destroy the work of month? and beside the modules get the 600k back?i read that with the right tactics during hug2, you were able to restore the standings for one gank in 1 hour. just 1 hour compared to 2 month? they say eve is clearly a game to fight. it may have been so in the beginning or intended to be. but now the economic part has grown so much that it is a symbiotical relationship. if miner would suddenly stop for 1 week or 2 the deliveries for the so beloved tru sec action would stop. and their game would suffer as well.no insurances for concording. re-gaining standing to enter high sec must be equal exhausting like the victims effort getting their values back."
1/17/2010,"please, stop embarrassing yourselves trying to convince the rest of us that this sec status hit is actually a cost. i've read threads in c&p on how to recover single gank sec status loss in under an hour. you show me how to earn enough to replace a 200 million isk mining ship in an hour, and we'll call that even - until then, don't feed me that crap about how the sec status loss hurts you. it's an inconvenience, nothing more."
1/17/2010,"scc aren't entirely controlled by concord, they are merely supervised and fall under the concord banner."
1/17/2010,"since i started playing suicide ganking has been nerfed at least 3 times. if insurance is removed i'll still do it, everyone else will still do it. even if it does reduce occurances do you know what?it still won't be enough for the carebears.they will lobby more and more for changes and reductions."
1/17/2010,no it would not. the minerals from mission runners and 0.0 industrialists/hauler spawn would probably be enough. 0.0 industrialists might even be able to make isk from their ships then.
1/17/2010,"is mining in high-sec suppose to be a risky activity? what's next, sitting all day in station and trading is risk free, let us shoot through station walls or smartbomb everyone inside?"
1/17/2010,mining in high sec as it is is hardly a risky activity. with an occasional suicide gank at least there is neglible risk. the problem with mining is probably the extremely low need for any sort of interaction that naturally leads to afk mining/botting and in turn makes you a better target for suicide ganks. station trading is risky in the sense that you could lose isk.
1/17/2010,"funniest thing is, that a lot of the time, although its profitable, people actually suicide gank to get the hate mail and the tears from the victims, just like in low sec, so unless you have a cure for that, then well, you'll never really stop suicide ganks :)"
1/17/2010,"i think its because they dont want to lose there easy targets.you know targets that they can be pretty sure will be doing kinetic , which they can tank strongly.its not just raven dude.consider the sac.double rainbow damage bonus to high damage heavy assaults.perfect slot layout to fit scram|web|injector|ab or mwdlow slots for tanks with godly resists.you can even get a nos/neut on there.it should be the most popular shortrange cruiser in eve if you listen to half the people posting in this thread.but no one flys them , cause even double damage bonused the dps is fail compared to most short range blaster/ac boats."
1/17/2010,"you're the one saying rainbow missile bonus is so much better and that it is ""unfair"" for missile boats to not get them. by your logic the sac should indeed be popular.meanwhile, you might be interested in this proposal."
1/17/2010,"yeah , why dont they fly sacri + other missile boats,except drake, if those are so awesome and balanced?"
1/17/2010,"you're a fool. what short range blaster/ac boats? the blaster deimos and the automuninn? nobody flies these either. it's nothing to do with dps, it's because flying a 100 mill hac that does less dps than a bc with less tank and has to go into tackle range to apply that dps is suicide."
1/17/2010,"i have updated the original post to remove the most unpopular/unviable bits. (not including the emo posts that are convinced i am just trying to get more carebears into lowsec to gang, when the oposite is true, what this is about is making lowsec a place for teh people who want to live there, not the occasional visitor)."
1/17/2010,i encourage a much needed low-sec boost to give it more purpose.
1/17/2010,"i agree, make it so you can change modules and sub systems at a pos."
1/17/2010,completely supported.
1/17/2010,my eyes are getting older and small fonts become tougher to read. which makes my old eyes tired.please include a setting in the game to set the font size significantly higher. i think that this is in the interest of all players - if not yet then it will become an issue in some years for many people playing eve.
1/17/2010,"this has been discussed at the meeting today and was deemed not good enough a proposal. so i will ask those who voted against with what kind of compromise they can come up.the argument that shield and armour are inherently different is a sound one. however, enter a bonus that is the same (non different! oo) on both platforms, and one of them is at a strong disadvantage there, and then the argument suddenly stops making sense.additionally, it was repeated that shields receive an advantage in the form of recharge - however in my opinion that 'advantage' may hardly carry the name because the actual hp/s gain of shield tanks is very small (unless the ship is specifically fitted for it, but pvp ships for whom gang bonuses are most useful rarely if ever are), and a small increase to something small is...negligible"
1/17/2010,not supported.i'll support it once you change the suggestion to include a shield recharge penalty proportional to the capacity bonus.
1/17/2010,i was thinking of that...would it really be that easy?
1/17/2010,"it would be as simple as one more formula for the server to calculate. basically after bonus shield recharge is replaced by pre bonus shield recharge. thats simplified for the math disabled- get a math dweeb to come up with something more polished. what we have are shields and armor- yes theyre different. as it stands now- with fleet bonuses applied- you would have to be a moron to use a shield ship if you cared about those bonuses at all. reasons why are shield recharge is too low to ""fill"" up the shield capacity the bonus gives youmost shield ships are buffer fit- not passive tanked and not active tankedany interuption in the bonus resets the shield to the lower amount- when it returns you have to ""fill"" it up againbasically i see three options for a proposal.1. make armor not ""fill"" up automatically when fleet bonuses are applied. just like shields dont fill up now- the capacity is there, just not filled.2. make shields fill up as armor fills up now when bonuses are applied. this may or may not include a condition of using the pre-bonus shield recharge as the ships passive recharge bonus.3. make a ""timer"" so that when the fleet bonus is interupted the shields dont ""deplete"" back to their unbonused state automatically. this would allow shields to be repped up (or passively recharged) and hold their bonused amounts long enough for a jump through a gate.cons- shields and armor are different and both should have advantages/disadvantages. some could say the way it is now- is a disadvantage meant to offset the advantages.pros- shields as they are now- are so blatantly worse for fleet pvp- that they are largely unused. none of the three above ""solutions"" will nerf of buff armor or shields in my opinion. they would make shield ships more of an option in fleet pvp again.also- fitting requirements of shield rr mods sucks balls. not the issue at hand- just throwing it out there. sucks balls."
1/17/2010,not supported unless armor gets a passive regen added in aswell
1/17/2010,small bump since i would like to see more votes for it!it's only a minor fix so should be easy to implement right
1/17/2010,"and 1 more thing need, fix that damn neutral overview setting ccp.6 years ago nothing happend with that. if remove neutrals from overview setting the wartargets dissapear from overview too."

1/17/2010,"hmm, very strong proposal you have here, with very solid arguments, thus, fully supported :)i've stopped flying astartes long time ago, because the isk-performance ratio is just not justifyable, to the one of a brutix/myrmidon, for example."

1/17/2010,"i fully endorse this idea. it's well written, logical, and overall helps to prevent many problems that occur in the current environment.it benefits everyone and doesn't affect actual gameplay."
1/17/2010,"not supported but clearly failed to be understood by anyone last time so will make another post i'd like to ask a question that's been hinted at but not covered in this thread: why is there an oversupply of minerals?this could alternatively be asked as: is there a group of people who would stop paying for subscriptions if minerals dropped below a certain price?it's my belief that the op's proposal would hurt ccp's income, it would drop the mineral price floor, raise the price of plexes and hurt newer players rather than older ones.an alternative suggestion is that rat loot gets dropped as bpcs, apologies that i can't find the post where this was mentioned but it really is a much better idea, the implications are however hard to understand without first understanding the plex market.imagine eve players to be on a scale from grinders at one end to pvpers on the other end, a pure grinder would probably have three or more accounts and do nothing but mining and industry whereas a pure pvper would live entirely off player loot and plexes.ccp have a very strong financial incentive to keep both extremes happy, a miner who can keep 3 pvpers paying for plexes is doing more to cover the costs of our servers and fancy graphics than those of us who buy long term subs.the result of this is there's an optimal plex price which provides the highest number of subscriptions and dropping the mineral price floor will alter the grinder/pvper balance.now that we've introduced the concept of plex balance lets take it one step further and consider average joe, to do this we have to revert to the original question and ask why is there an oversupply of minerals?there's a fundamental difference between game world economics and rl economics in that a rl person working for minimum wage will find it hard to buy a new mercedes whereas a veldspar miner needs to be able to buy the occasional geddon or cerb and loose it in pvp.essentially there needs to be a very high minimum wage in eve otherwise casual players become the equivalent of burger flippers at mcdonalds and simply cancel their subs.currently this minimum wage is provided by two things, mission/rat payouts and insurance payouts. the current problems with ship insurance being more than the production cost of a ship are caused by the minerals from mission/rat payouts undercutting hard working miners and thus forcing them to live on the dole (insurance payouts).to put it another way average joe who doesn't have the backing of an alliance has to choose from rats, roids, industry or piracy as a way of making a living so if there's a game mechanic (rat loot) that undercuts one of his options (roids) then he needs concord payouts to survive as a miner or has to ditch this profession altogether.tl;dr (and the reason i'm not supporting the op):dropping the insurance payout forces people to ditch a profession through a bad game mechanic and fails to tackle the root of the problem. changing rat loot from modules to bpcs would see the removal of a mineral fountain, the introduction of a mineral sink and ultimately raise ship prices above insurance prices."
1/17/2010,"so you think ccp should abandon miners to the free market even if that means loosing subscriptions? haha good luck with that. bear in mind that a free market can not exist inside a virtual universe where the developers decide how big asteroids are, how much ships cost to build, etc. how many miners we need is 100% decided by ccp and there's nothing the game market can do about that.if you understand the root of the problem then why are you advocating a drop in the mineral price floor that would potentially drive people away from the game rather than fixing the mechanic that is driving down mineral prices?"
1/17/2010,"every other profession gets ""abandoned to the free market"". why do miners deserve special protection and subsidy? are you saying that people who mine are all incapable of adapting and respecialising?because miners deserve the advantages of the free market, as well as its rigors. that's called ""balance""."

1/17/2010,"a way to use a base price on average market, without the possibility to ""exploit"" this by placing buy/sell order is to base ite on an average price on items solds. you can place buy or sell order the price you want, but people wont buy a drake for 300 m ...anyway, the other option for insurance is to have a real insurance system, this mean, if you loose ships, the insurance cost will be every time higher... some weeks, or months without big losses... the insurance price get lowered...it has to be calculated, but i think this way, you will take care of your ships, in pvp, the ships could be insure by the corporation, or not insure at all. it will also introduce a new system of valor... : i take care of my ship. i dont want my ship destroyed, even if its not the factional battleship.by the way, it could depend on ""isk loss"" of ships, so if you lost 15 frigates, its not a big deal for insurances, but if you loss 5 battleships..."

1/17/2010,"it's 4am.i've just had two awesome peanut-butter and jam sammiches.it's very much past when i was supposed to go to bed.now that that's out of the way, i'll extrapolate a bit on this.csm - appointed by ccp as community representatives from the community's side as opposed to ccp's side; responsible for siphoning issues or proposals that appear to weight the most heavily on the minds of the eve playerbase as a whole.csm - members of which are voted for by players; whether legitimate or 'at all valid', cannot and probably should not be investigated fully - it's everyones' responsibility to vote etc.now, don't get me wrong - i've been playing eve my fair share of years like any other 'average joe', but i do expect a little more professionalism from the csm. of the first two years' candidates, that i saw, the level of professionalism was generally fairly high - the csm members didn't present issues the same way the average 'nerf ninja salvage' threads' ops do - they detailed the situation at hand and made structured proposals for those issues.ccp is in all likelyhood very aware of lag issues for large fleet fights, and they are likely even more aware of the fact that, even when dedicating a considerably large portion of server resources to any given system(s), there is still lag to the point of fights becoming unmanagable for the clients.more than this, they, by now, probably have a few good ideas as to what is causing the lag, and are still busy trying to find ways around, or through, whatever those may be.what doesn't help them is when the people they have appointed (that's you, in the csm), cannot offer proposals even at a level on par with or above that of a development greenhorn.try to remember that those responsible for developing and running this game also play the same game, on the same server, with the same issues as you.try to remember that while you are a member of the csm, you are meant to be 'above us simple folk' - if not, then we might as well all have a csm badge under our avatars, because we're all equally qualified to come make 'proposals' that 'should be taken into special consideration'.that's why i'm disappointed. i expected more professionalism, but it seems the delegates may well simply be voted in by peers rather than bystanders these days...there's nothing to support on this thread that isn't already supported by every single player of eve, every time they log in."
1/17/2010,well said!remind me to buy you a drink when walk in stations gets completed.o7
1/17/2010,"that's a lot of assumptions there, but assuming they indeed do, why aren't they telling us? why aren't they posting progress reports about their pitched battle to defeat the lag monster?eve atm is broken, while they were well on their way of fixing it with apocrypha. they can introduce fancy new stuff every few months all they want, but it's not helping the core game play any. dominion was hauled in with a lot of pr as the patch that would make sovereignty what it always should have been, yet it has only resulted in a lot of frustrated players wishing that server performance was as good as pre-dom. (i had to ctrl-q my titan yesterday morning to save it because the game was so ****ed up)and lollerskates @ the people who expect me to be super serial only because i carry a csm label. i'm doing the exact same things i did before, namely trying to make eve a better game, only now i get to fly to iceland to tell it to their face.i'm not a smooth talking politician, i won't wear a tie and i sure as hell won't pretend to be anything else than what i am for the sake of gaining support.don't like it, don't vote for me.- sok."
1/17/2010,"maybe you have never written a report but they take time and a knowledgeable person to write them. so asking for volounteers for the test on sisi and the very occasional ""we are working on this"" is the way to go. pretenting a regular report is the way to slow the resolution of the problem, not the way to accelerate it."
1/17/2010,"ironic you should say that ""don't like it, don't vote for me"".as i said, it looks like csm are voted in by their peers as opposed to bystanders these days.as mentioned though, you cannot honestly expect ccp to write up a report once a week on their progress in ""battling the lag monster"". it's firstly not feasible and secondly not sensible.the community has a nasty habit of biting whichever community representatives from ccp come forth to do their job, and present information, in the ass. repeatedly. for no good reason. because they're spoiled little brats.when they have to scramble their team of community heads to come and try to calm a situation down, that's human resources that could have been spent doing far more important things than pacifying a bunch of children.that is why the csm are expected to be more professional. that is why it doesn't help when a csm member is no different from a forum whiner.that is why, if your kind of behaviour and level of professionalism is all it takes to be on the csm, the csm might as well not exist; because we're all as good as csm then anyway.while a member of the csm you are a representative of ccp, not only the playerbase. try to shape up a bit and act like one.while we're quoting the csm wiki page"
1/17/2010,"i dunno, its a rather severe problem so some sort of update system would be appreciated by yours truly.and to me, that means not going full ******, trolling/flaming people and not using your csm powers to gain an in-game advantage over others. if you have general doubts about my sanity, i invite you to check out some of my other contributions to the csm so far, best place to start would be the minutes from past meetings."
1/17/2010,"you're confusing sensibility/rationality with professionalism/decency now...*edit*trying to find proposals/issues raised by you now, i come across this little gem..."
1/17/2010,"you are confusing professionalism and decency with being a smooth talking politician. i'll keep trying to make eve a better game in the same way that i did before, it's not like i could magically morph into barack obama upon election, and i wouldn't want to either.*edit* and that proposal was too specific as i noted in that thread. we don't know the code, so we can't blindly give detailed directions as to what they should do. the overarching problem however persists and precisely because we as players can't be of much help there i request that ccp inform us better about the state of progress."
1/17/2010,"which is exactly why i'm saying that you're no better than a f&i whiner.you are doing nothing in this thread but posting what countless people post on that forum category every single day, and that's without even looking at the gd forum, which is similarly overrun by a flood of threads whenever a system crashes.ccp is aware of the issue, they don't need their time wasted by being reminded of the issue and having to sit in an official meeting where they could talk about things that they don't necessarily know about that are on the players' minds - such as the proposals made in last week's meeting.as stated before, giving frequent updates on what's being done is not feasible; in part because this could give information to potential or existing shareholders that they should not necessarily be aware of, that could sway their position as shareholders - in business practice, some degree of opacity in company operations is a good thing.they are 'doing less damage' to themselves by not giving the playerbase frequent updates than they would if they were to.look at it this way;if you're experiencing lag issues, you'll be the first to notice when they're not there anymore. would you really need a report to let you know this? would knowing it's coming a week before it does, make it arrive sooner? or would it simply cause you to be more aggravated if the changes end up making no noticeable difference 'the way they were promised to' by ccp?is any of this, still, an excuse for you to behave like a whining player as opposed to a representative of the community and intermediary between the players and the development teams?i only recently started browsing this forum category out of curiosity, but have in the past seen traces of csm posts here and there, and you are, quite frankly (in my opinion), a very poor example for the csm."
1/17/2010,"i'm a very poor example of csm in your book because you want to see slick smooth talking guys and i ain't ever gonna be that.i know they are aware of the issues.i know they are working on them.but i don't know whether they are aware of the huge frustration that it causes among the playerbase and the urgency many people feel about it. i'm certain that if i asked around in corp, the vast majority could care less about all the other promises and gimmicks, they just want to see the game fixed.and again i'd like to point you to things i've done in the past weeks, 'serious business' proposals et cetera, but you seem rather focused on this one. just because you don't see the urgency of it doesn't mean it deserves no attention. we are here to help improve the game and woah, this just seems like something that needs fixin'."
1/17/2010,"actually, i went and had a read through at least the meeting minutes raw log...i don't expect the csm to be 'smooth talkers', i simply expect them to carry themselves with more professionalism than the average player, because honestly, i don't think i want someone that talks like a ninja-salvage whiner to be representing the views and concerns of the playerbase, and i think a lot of other people will feel the same way in that regard.that is, yet again, why i said ""looks like the csm are voted in by their peers"". i didn't vote for the csm because i knew nothing about the candidates and was at the time far too busy to go and look at their general forum behaviour or their ability to be rational and neutral while at the same time carrying themselves with some degree of decency.you are a poor candidate, in my books, because you refuse to treat the playerbase that you believe yourself to be representing with the level of respect they deserve; why should their desires and needs to carried in your hands? why was the proposal made to see if there are things that can be reduced/removed from the client/server interactions thread 'too specific', where your 'proposal' is so ambiguous, we might as well throw a banana at the server and see what the end result is?your opening post is summed up pretty much as:we were gonna have a fightthe system crashedccp fix it!that kind of crap should be limited to the endless threads that get locked in gd, not this forum category. worse than this is that your original thread title was ""proposal: fix ur game""the other guy's thread could be summed up asi don't know what happens between the server and game but...turning effects off on my side seems to help a bit with (client) lagif we're gonna have them off anyway for huge fights, can't the server not send us the associated info?that doesn't seem too specific to me in a sense, as, even if you don't know what happens in the background, you could still bring the overall concept to the attention of ccp - namely that there may be aspects of the data sent to clients that they could choose to not receive, even on a per-person basis, to try and help with lag. if you guys had to know exactly how the servers and clients work for you to bring up any suggestions, there would likely be no csm, as some of the most debated topics ""wouldn't be feasible for the csm to bring up""; namely those related to system sovereignty, system performance indexes and similarly complex things.anyway, since we're not going to see eye to eye on why it is that i don't like you, i'll ask you about what seems to be the core issue for you, here.- detail what information ccp could potentially provide to the players with regards to combating lag is concerned.- give examples of what you think the potential player-side reactions and subsequent forum fallout might be, whether good or bad news- give examples of what you think the potential player-side reactions and subsequent forum fallout might be, should 'promises' made by ccp not be lived up to due to unforeseen consequences, interruptions or failures- detail what you think the process of writing up a report for the playerbase on at least a weekly basis would involve; possibly include some timeframes and inter-employee interaction timeframes involved in the process- explain why you think it's a good idea for them to do so- explain why you might think it might not be a good idea for them to do soactually make a proposal here other thanfix ur gameorwe wants reports on lag combating, giev nao"
1/17/2010,"now we're getting somewhere.1) the players have concluded that lag has gotten a lot worse post-domi. ccp could comment with possibilities why this is the case. is it caused by anything obvious that changed with dominion?2) players could give feedback on how fights in different circumstances (sisi..) affected performance. if the conclusion is that with present-day technology, the whole if it simply cannot work, then fine, we need to adapt to it and adjust our expectations accordingly. but ccp regularly makes claims in the media about the performance of their servers..3) ccp promises us and delivers shiny new toys regularly - surely they have internally set goals for themselves about this situation that they can share with us? if they are honest about their expectations and prospects then i don't4) weekly basis would be a whole lot and i don't think it would be wise to make it so rigid. rather, let us know when a milestone has been reached.5) openness to the people that pay for their toilet paper. there is a lot at stake for many people, time, effort spent, significant amounts of real life money involved.6) it's their code and they can do whatever they want with it, but if they want to make sure eve stays attractive for many among us then they need to address it. the way it is now, many people are frustrated and disappointed and i don't think it would be wise to ignore that only on the assumption that they are working on it. i want to hear from ccp about it before trusting that 'they are on it'."
1/17/2010,i like this idea....although the two things i see missing from pos life are better refine rates & the ability to repackage.
1/17/2010,"sounds like a good idea. alternatively a ore faction refinery array would be fine as well, i guess..."
1/17/2010,having a faster pc and reducing gfx settings has been confirmed to work in the past.

1/18/2010,"/me signs thisi don't fly caldari much but it must be said that only giving a damage bonus to one type of ammunition is kind of silly. especially when missles only do one type of damage. this means that a drake is best used when having kinetic ammo, with this in mind it is well known that kinetic damage is normally one of the easiest to tank against because of the natural armour and shield bonuses to most ships in relation to kinetic resistances. the problem you have with giving a damage bonus to caldari ships for all missles could be a caldari buff. yes it is overdue probably and this should be changed but the bonus would make caldari ships alot more powerful. now while most people argue that caldari ships aren't that powerful i can quote a few ship setups and people who can prove you wrong.with high enough skills caldari deal alot of pain, yes it doesn't have the refire rate of lets say, autocannons or blasters but the damage when it finally hits is normally quite good.reference: cerberus (its the worst sniper hac because its not instant hit like guns, but it deals alot of damage per volley)"
1/18/2010,this should be balanced fair./signed
1/18/2010,"no support. here's why:typically, the other races cannot discard their damage bonuses in combat, because projectiles are the only other weapons system that can change damage types. compare with lasers or hybrids - those weapon systems are stuck doing 100% of their base damage types. with missiles, you can choose to do 100% of your base damage with kinetic missiles (which is still the racial damage type i might add), or you get the option of doing 80%+ of your nominal damage, with any other damage type you choose.trust me, if i had the option to fire pure explosive damage from lasers with 80% of base damage, i would relish the flexibility it would provide (and it would be a rather massive boost to lasers). so asking to have not just this capability, but to do 100% base damage with off-damage types, is asking to have your cake and eat it.be happy that you have the bonus of not being tied to standard racial damage - rather than complaning that you have to make a small sacrifice to get this flexibility. (if you're changing damage in the first place, you're obviously doing more damage even with the reduction than you would have done with kinetic ammo - remember that!)."
1/18/2010,"if laser were made into a multi damage type weapons system , they would have there raw dps reduced.would you still be happy if you could select damage type but after a cut of maybe lets say 30% base dps ?.be careful what you wish for.if you look at the dps of ac's to pulse or ac's to blaster. you will see that those weapons systems that cannot change damage type start off with more dps.this is especially apparant and easier to compare with blasters <> ac , lasers have supperior range profiles.looking at the best small blaster versus best small ac for example you'll see best small blasters start with 30% more dps with very similar range profiles and exactly the same tracking.your right it is good to be able to change damage type.its more than good , its pretty essential when solo in cmb's.consider that the best damage types to fire in most cirsumstances are em/exp depending upon target a 5% per level boost to kinetic is not actually worth much.at level 5 cmb hull trainingif you consider an eanm'd armor tanker for instance 5% kinetic would be worth around 15% dps against amarr base resists , about 5% against gall base resists and about 10% against mini/cal base resists when your looking at performance of bonused kin over and above unbonused exp.looking at t1 shield tanks.if em is patched then kinetic 5% offers a small increase over unbonused thermal , maybe 5% if em isnt patched then kinetic bonus is worthless over unbonused em.overall a 5% kinetic bonus is worth maybe 1.6% dps per player skill level.that the problem with it , its a damage specific bonus to a weapons system that is designed and balanced as a weapons system that does multi damage types.missiles dont start with huge dps , just like proj dont start with huge dps.it is a neccessary tactic to select a damage type that hits against a hole.and lets be clear about this , if your target has a decent setup that ""hole"" is likelly to only be 20% lower than his best resist or less.if i were flying a cmbi should not be grateful that i have to fight without any kind of damage bonus just because i am using the tactics required of the weapons system.the 5% kin bonus has been on cal ships from year dot as far as i know.missiles have changed a lot since the 5% kin bonuses were introduced.its time to take a good look at the 5% kin bonus in relaton to the current performance of missiles."
1/18/2010,"okay, we can argue all day and dodge the real issue here.your core premise in your argument is that;caldari missile boats with the +5% kinetic damage bonus are underpowered.please demonstrate it."
1/18/2010,"i think the biggest issue to me is that hybrids/lasers do 2 damage types, projectiles it varies obviously but with a lot of caldari ships you are stuck with only 1 damage type or you lose all your bonuses that and the bonuses are not very streamlined because a few ships can shoot any missile of any type and retain bonuses but it seems like for some reason a lot of other caldari missile ships can't. i just dont see the point i suppose if it's good enough for the raven, sac, phoon, ect it should be ok for the caracal, drake, cerberus, ect, none of those ships are really overpowered, maybe cept the drake.. but i would just say it's a good ship and one of the few viable caldari soloboats so nerf it if you must but it's not like we have a whole wide range of selection really, drake is about as easy as it gets and it get substantially more difficult after that to fit a tackle on a caldari shipswitching your ammo really shouldn't cost you your ship bonus, and missiles could use the versatility considering how lacking they are right now (yes i know they rock the pve but raven variants already don't lose dps swapping missiles who cares its a moot point)"
1/18/2010,"you do realize i have already won if your whole argument is ""caldari missile boats aren't overpowered so it's okay to boost them."""
1/18/2010,what kind of demonstration would you like in a text forum ?mathematical analysis of the value of the bonus has been provided.statistical analysis of the effectivness/popularity of cmb's has been provided.

1/18/2010,"true, acs have the lowest base dps out of all turret types. however, it's not just a matter of selectable damage types; they are also capless, have by far the greatest falloff of all turrets (especially with barrage), and the greatest tracking.in fact in many situations, i would much rather have the extra range and engagement envelope of projectiles hard-wired with barrage, compared to equivalent blasters (with a like-for-like weapon bonus). in other words, projectiles are competitive if not better regardless of their ability to change damage types. in fact i do typically fit acs on a myrmidon for example rather than blasters, and they're almost always firing barrage.if you consider an eanm'd armor tanker for instance 5% kinetic would be worth around 15% dps against amarr base resists , about 5% against gall base resists and about 10% against mini/cal base resists when your looking at performance of bonused kin over and above unbonused exp.looking at t1 shield tanks.if em is patched then kinetic 5% offers a small increase over unbonused thermal , maybe 5% if em isnt patched then kinetic bonus is worthless over unbonused em.overall a 5% kinetic bonus is worth maybe 1.6% dps per player skill level.indeed, the weapons system is designed and balanced around the ability to do multiple damage types. and then the ships and their bonuses are balanced around the package as a whole. that's where your argument falls flat; the ships with kinetic damage bonuses are balanced against other equivalent ships.you can't makes claims like the raven getting a rainbow damage bonus being a case for the drake getting it too, for example, as they're two different ships balanced differently (and appropriately). the raven actually has less (primary) weapon hardpoints that the drakethey do do lower dps, but missiles are capless, are not crippled at all by tracking disruptors - hell, are not crippled at all by tracking (in fact they'll hit a target orbiting you at 500m better than they would if they orbited further out), have further range than other weapons with their ""high-damage"" ammo, hit too-small/too-fast targets for more damage than equivalent turrets would, etc.besides, if the hole is less than 20% then hey, you never need to worry about changing and so the damage bonus is always working in your favour. cool.again, let's compare this to a laser ship attacking an armour tanker. it may likely have a 25% bonus as well, but against em and therm resists it will be taking a much larger damage loss than kinetic/explosive would.basically, i would love to fight without a damage bonus in this situation (and use explosive) as it would let me do about 50% more actual damage than being stuck with em/therm."
1/18/2010,"i thought this thread would die, but it refuses to do so.this is simply not true. firstly, you cannot compare the ""best small blaster"" to the ""best small autocannon"" without noting that their fitting requirements are vastly different (about twice the requirements for the blaster). you're much better off comparing the 200mm autocannon ii to the light electron blaster ii; they have identical fitting requirements:it's true that the blaster has higher damage with the high-damage ammunition (antimatter charge s versus emp s), but it's 13 dps for the blaster and 11 dps for the autocannon.the optimal range is the same for both weapons with this ammunition (0.6, unbonused) but the falloff range is vastly different -- and with such short range, the falloff value is immensely important; the blaster hits 50% damage at approximately 1750 meters while the autocannon doesn't hit 50% damage until 4500 meters (at 4500 meters, the blaster is doing just about 0 damage). if you've ever fought a close-range fight, you know that this is not a similar range profile.if the smaller amount of damage is because of anything, it is because of this sheer range bonus, but note the next point.using the longest range ammunition (iron charge s versus carbonized lead s) shows very similar range results, just add another 1300 meters to the numbers above; however, the base damage for both weapons using these munitions is exactly the same -- clearly the autocannon is superior in this case.you're analyzing a different game than the rest of us are; your analysis doesn't have much to do with eve, rather it has to do with you attempting to support your platform that the caldari should have the magical ability to choose damage types.the weapon systems are designed to be different. a missile launcher's primary selling point is range and constant damage over that range. a caracal can hit targets out to 126 km with level 5 skills, or 110 km with level 4 skills; that is it's selling point, not the ability to switch damage types. it's stuck with kinetic for a bonus, so what? no other t1 cruiser can hit out to that range for full damage. a drake can hit targets out to 73 km with full damage; again, no battlecruiser can manage this feat without switching out for lower damage, longer range munitions and/or a variety of range increasing modules. the penalty for this? you're right, kinetic-only damage bonus.the sacrilege may have a rainbow damage bonus, but it's only bonused for heavy assault missiles and it's stuck with the 17km range they offer.if you want to switch damage types, use a ship that is bonused for rof already; don't switch out this bonus across the board willy nilly.as has been said, and as will continue to be said: there may be problems with some ships, but the bonus is not the problem -- a blanket bonus change is certainly not the solution."
1/18/2010,"the 5% kinetic bonuses were not balanced around the current incarnation of missiles.5%k bonuses were added to the ships ( those that were in game ) at the start of eve.the 5%k bonuses used to be ok on missile boats that allways hit for full damage , no matter the targets size or velocity.the 5%k bonuses were sh#te back then but it hardle mattered as missiles were so op.i remember frying a thorax in 2 volleys of fof cruise in my raven back in the days.now missile have been fixed and rightly so as it was impossible to fly small ships back in those days and even think about tackling a cmb a ship class larger than what you were flying.but at no point have the bonuses on cmb's been revisited since missiles have been altered, its now important that missile boats have bonuses designed around current missiles not 2005 missiles."
1/18/2010,"1. this is a ship balance thread.2. where? and yes, it is your job to produce this information. that's the whole point of this forum - someone identifies a problem, proves that it's a problem, then proposes a solution. you are proposing a boost to many ships; you need to prove that these ships a) are underpowered relative to their counterparts and b) propose an appropriate solution. you haven't done anyway of this. yet."
1/18/2010,"it makes no sense to compare smallest blaster versus biggest ac.you argument about fitting doesnt take into account the amount of resourses ( grid/cpu/cap ) on the respective target ships.fitting best of all t2 usually leads to a situation where the fitting isnt possible without implants or usage of some sort of meta 4 mod.it is sensible to compare largest size to largest size , or smallest to smallest.theres no magic involved , mini do it day in day out with full bonuses to all. range is great v npc, but against players is ofzero value sololittle value in small gangs worthless in fleets due to flight time.listen to what you are saying, the bonus you train for is your penalty.your right it feels like that flying cmb'sno the problem with cmb's is there bonus.8% more dps ( average ) for training lvl5does not compete with25% more dps ( avergae ) for training lvl5improving the bonus on cmb's is the solution."
1/18/2010,"1. this is not a ship balance thread.ship balance would be altered theres no dought about that.but this thread considers more aspect of play than mearly ship v ship balance.the purpose of this thread it to highlight the contradictory nature of ( cmb bonuses awarded for ship hull training ) and ( caldari combat tactics (damage type switching)).2. directly after the first time you asked for it , page 5 ? 6 ? are you an eve-bay account or do you have the memory of a goldfish ?2a. you yourself have agreed that many of the ships are u.p. why is further debate on this required ?you want me to convince you of a fact to which you allready agree ?we may differ on the reasons why cmb x,y,z is underpowered but the fact that they are in need of help is not in question.2b. this thread is the appropriate solution.raise the value of the cmb's bonus to be equal to 25% dps at level 5."

1/18/2010,"when a mission runner abandons a wreck it becomes blue with the last patch. a way to ""drag"" salvagers to these wrecks would be increasing the signature together with that thus making adandoned wrecks easier to scan down than those who are not abandoned should be covered by making deadspace covering the signature of wrecks thus making them more difficult to scan them down. that is a social problem not a technical one. and salvage was not meant to help the mission runner as stated by ccp.further you already can make bookmarks of containers respectively wreck fields and contract them. something to further strengthen this might be the option display the age of contracted bookmarks and their destination systems so the buyer of those bookmarks can see if he is within the 2hour despawn time and if the system is somewhat close to him."
1/18/2010,"definitely in support of this one, especially the idea of making deep space probes need astrometrics iii and combat scanners to need v. i mean really, between the fact that scanning down someone actively trying not to get found ought conceivably be harder than scanning down a massive anomaly, and the fact that deep space probes are a lot less useful than they were when initially implemented..well anyway, yea on both counts. wrecks scan-able and all for all the above stated pros."
1/18/2010,"i have no problems with that, and would support it if it were limited to abandoned wrecks. but you have to ask, how many people will abandon them? i've done belt salvage, and most of the wrecks i come across are yellow, despite people being long gone and not coming back. same with militia gate salvage, despite t1 wrecks not even worth the time to salvage for them. not really, unless you make it so difficult as to be prohibitive. in which case it would be useless, see above. uh, what's the point then if salvage is only designed to work one way? currently its a one-sided proposition-a ninja salvager enriches himself. with tools both people can come out handily and maybe we wont have such rancor, and salvagers wont be seen as rats and thieves so much.if you are going to suggest a kludge like contracting bookmarks, why not just formalize it with a real salvage contract and make it less hassle? stuff like this is just trying to use salvagers to act as a nerf to hisec mission runners, and it's annoying. if ccp wants to nerf them, have the guts and do so, don't put players in the position to do it."

1/18/2010,this.
1/18/2010,and you read the math about the uselessness of passive recharge except for passive fits?in worst case we can use this compromise.
1/18/2010,how is this remotely related to the question at hand?the problem- shield tanked ships are not being used in fleet pvp. the reasons are clear and stated above. are you telling me the extra 5 or 6 dps per second that a shield tanked ship with a bonus gets bugs you? do you realize the resist bonus that armor gets far surpasses this in terms of tank?aside from all that- if that is really the issue- we have an option to remove the extra passive recharge bonus. the amount is so small as to be truly laughable anyway.

1/18/2010,"i really think the big problem is the session change issue - it resets every time you change sessions. basically, if it was instantly applied (like armor), armor tanks would have a lesser bonus than shield tanks. as it is, shield tanks have a lesser (worthless in many situations) bonus than armor tanks. really, it is a useless bonus for anything but drakes when going directly into a fight (gate/bridge/undock). for everything else, it is only useful in a camp.reset the bonus for pilots below a a newly promoted fc, wc, sc - not every time the fleet moves."
1/18/2010,"as this is part of the data-cleanup section of the proposal, it is definitely up for debate. i was only trying to bring a newly-transfered char as close to a newly-created one as possible. i understand that for isk-laundering purposes, your wallet history may mot be ""deletable"", but the rest, in my opinion, could be wiped. the more important part of this proposal, and the only part i care if it survives or not, is the first part about role-dropping and an employment history entry for ""character sold"". i think those are the important aspects of this proposal. the others are just niceties.oh, and shamelessly supporting my proposal."

1/18/2010,"currently the forum offers few features to aid in the process of raising proposals, voting and finally managing proposals and their interaction with csm.firstly, an incomplete list of issues with the assembly hall forum:- proposals aren't categorized in any form, while the issues raised range from the art department to game balance issues, to technical problems to meta-proposals like this one- similar proposals can't be grouped / duplicate proposals aren't avoided- you can't give a negative vote (you have to not vote to disapprove). as one implication, people that post multiple times seemingly lower the approval rating of the proposal- pretty much only proposals on the front page get attention, so people resort to bumping, displacing other potentially good proposals- since the csm has a limited capacity to raise proposals/issues, even proposals with excellent approval get buried/forgotten, given enough time- once csm picked up an issue, the proposals can't be tagged as having been raised and they can't be linked to the csm wiki; the same applies after the issue has been approved/rejected by ccp.to partially address these issues, i propose the following additions:- when creating proposals, offer a selection of main categories. additionally, allow adding search tags.- allow searching/filtering the forum by number of votes/approval rating/category/tags. a tag cloud would be interesting, too.- allow voting for or against a proposal, or no vote at all- on the thread overview, show the number of votes (that is not the number of posts) + the current approval rating- link your vote to a proposal, not to a specific post of yours, so you can easily change your vote if you change your mind, without having to search for the post in question- allow csm members to link a proposal thread to raised issues on the wiki.this is only the tip of the iceberg of what could be done, but it's a start."

1/18/2010,"the 'auto-inject' idea is about the most meritorious i've seen yet.if the prereqs are in que and will enable the use of a skill you should be able to select it to inject when the que gets to that point. the skillbook is locked down (grayed and untouchable) until the que is available to inject it.the only caveat would be that the book would either have to be in the cargohold of the currently active ship, or the person would have to be docked at the station that they have the book at (in their hangar). that to prevent injecting a book while 40 jumps away (unless there's a skill to enable it like scientific networking or similar skills)."
1/18/2010,"planets should have 3 areas of concern or ability.upper atmosphere - transition area from regular space into planetary. should have many around a planet depending on size. would correspond to lower atmos/ground areas.lower atmosphere - the area above the ground that can interact with the ground.ground - ummm where the ground is.... lol or water or lava.........new developement is huge here. looking at the planet types lines of vehicles.before dust 514 comes into play, open up the upper atmosphere to orbital ships/structures that can manipulate the lower atmosphere and ground for developement. get vehicle bpo's, personnel, building items seeded for research. add bays to ships for planetary based interactions.develope planetary ships and structures for rts interaction.interim rts play can be all with npc units, so that planets can be developed so that when dust hits, there is something for them to do other than just npc space.i actually believe the rts introduction will be the hugest upgrade to date of eve. so player involvement now with helping give direction will hopefully result in outstanding play. many of us have played many different games and can give input as to what worked well and what didnt. i know i played swg for many years till it was dumbed down and left. it had both planetary and space based play. while eve hands down beats the space play of swg. the planetary play has alot of good lessons."
1/18/2010,"theres a proposal that relates to this- its about gang bonus effects on shield tanked ships. i think this issue is just one of many regarding the overall issue of shield vs armor feasibility. as it stands now- i believe shield tanks have more disadvantages then advantages. compared to armor tanking shield tanking is not a viable option in fleet and this is demonstrated daily by the ratio of armor tanked ships vs shield tanked ships you see in combat on a regular basis.this proposal- is to have csm ,and perhaps ccp, look at the overall picture and propose re-balancing changes with the intention of making armor and shield tanking comparably worthwhile overall.just two issues that should come up-shield rr fitting costs ridiculously out of line.shields not receiving an ehp increase when gang bonuses are applied. give your support to a re-evaluation of the two tank types on a whole. add any issues you feel that are unbalanced with either tank type as the mechanic stands now."
1/18/2010,not supported. overall the balance is ok
1/18/2010,have you ever gone up against a drake? or a ubertanked raven?if you have... you'd be questioning this proposal.not supported.
1/18/2010,shield tanking in general is fine. shield transporters and gang bonusses are an issue though.
1/18/2010,ive used both. im not suggesting shields are horribly broken and never used. im saying there are enough broken aspects to discourage use of shield ships- especially in fleeted pvp.take the last 10 fleet fights you were in. altogether did shield tanked ships make up even close to 50% of the ships used total? from my experience- not even close. if to fix whats unbalanced means re-examining the overall balance- then i say thats the way to go. its not my intent to limit this to shields- this is not a buff shields thread. this is an effort to identify any issues that exist with either system.supported because an overall re-examination is better then fixing one flaw at a time- which if done is more likely to cause other unbalancing issues.
1/18/2010,"this.shield rr is pretty evenly matched with armor tbh. it is just a case of there are only a few fleet compositions where shield rr tanks would fit better than armor rr (due to so many ships with so few mid slots).shield tanks aren't used in bs fleets partly because shield rr is the lesser option, partly because armor provides a better buffer, but also because most of the good fleet pvp ships in the game are naturally armor tanked. it makes sense to have a fleet uniformly tanked because rr is significantly better than local tanking."
1/18/2010,fair enough... i suppose it needs to be looked into... cautionary support.
1/18/2010,"it could be nice to see the ""all dominant"" armor tanking not be so all dominant (in pvp).above casual support."
1/18/2010,i have raised the issue for next meeting (24th) and created a wiki page to support it.
1/18/2010,"the current implementation of sov warfare has attempted to narrow the focus of fights to the sovereignty modules, outpost (if present) and the sbu's. the pos's are gone but the reinforcement timers are still here with a vengeance. the sov modules have 3 timers. they have such little variance that the aggressors' schedule is completely controlled by ccp and the defender. this leaves the aggressor with almost no initiative. once the process starts, you must follow the recipe or give up. this formula leaves a bad taste. to counter the horrible mechanics, the aggressor must attempt to out-blob the defenders. perhaps this was ccp's intent? lets have massive fleet battles! sadly, even with reinforced processing nodes they have been crashing consistently.to sum it up:- change the r/f timer variance such that it is dramatically wider than it is today and random. no one likes to have the game control your schedule!- increase the ehp on the sbu's. they are too easily destroyed. if the sbu's have more survivability then the aggressors will have more flexibility. alternatively, tie all the deployed sbu's together such that to destroy them, all must be attacked together or in succession before a single one offlines. this is effectively adding survivability to the sbu's and the associated flexibility to the aggressor.- lag. node crashing. this is a technical hurdle that i am sure that ccp is already investing in. what i would like to see is periodic updates(bi-weekly) on the status of this issue. a major aspect of game play is effectively crippled at this time. the fraction of the player base who is interested in this needs to know whats going on in order to plan accordingly.thanks in advance for your consideration.bbb"
1/18/2010,"what you should have said is 'no one likes to have the defenders control your schedule!' - because what you've just proposed is exactly that. the game randomly decides what time you have to get out of bed to defend your space.i agree that the nodes crashing is wearing a bit thin, given that there are actually enjoyable fights happening, but 'random timers' makes everyone unhappy, whereas defender chosen timers makes only the attackers unhappy."
1/18/2010,"while it may be better than current situation, i agree that large variation in random timer is unwanted. system is still broken when you have to reinforce it several times until random number generator returns something that is favourable for you."
1/18/2010,"timezone warfare should be abolished, double or triple the random factor presently associated with reinforcement timers and be done with it.eve is war. once turtling is a guarantee for success it becomes my little hippo in space. lag occurs after every patch, latest one introduced blob-friendly war mechanics so effects are multiplied. it will get sorted in due time as it always is."
1/18/2010,"you raise some valid points, especially on exploitation in 0.0.there's a number of ways you could fix this;- let the index be based around the amounts actually transferring the market, or ""being sold"".essentially, it would still be possible to create a high index, but this would assume that people didn't buy stuff from the market in the entire region. (or, at least, is decisive to pay 20x empire price for it).if they instead decide to import items from highsec to seed on their own market, they would effectively increase the demand in highsec, thus effectively decreasing supply, which, normally, leads to increased prices. (whether these pricechanges would actually effect the economy of highsec, i cannot say)doing this also has another ""benefit"" (depending on pov): 0.0 would, in average, have a much higher income potential than empire.the problem would be, that the static outcome would remain about the same; to my knowledge, npc items are not seeded in 0.0 stations.as i see it, there's practically only 2 static isk sinks in 0.0;- market taxes- pos fuel(i don't include blowing ships up)market taxes increasing (by, say, 20times) would make sense, while pos fuel increase by 20 times wouldn't (lore-wise). this could be explained, however, that the pos workers (?) would want more stuff... (gameplay wise, makes sense, lore, nope)essentially, my idea was to create an eve that would really feel like a ""true"" market on all aspects, and balance out the game a little, isk-wise. (since eve practically runs on isk)"
1/18/2010,"nooooo, this is not a rant to make them better or more profitable, or what.it's about the kinds of storyline missions that i see. there are, what, maybe *five* once you get to the level 4 or 5 area??while i was grinding standings with a hauler every storyline was combat (every story line, not a single hauling/mining mission)... now that i'm doing combat missions every storyline is a hauling mission!everysingleone.either 'materials for war' which returns a laughable waste of time at 0.6~ standings gain, or the instanely danerous 'move 40k m/3 of cargo cans 10 jumps into lowsec' for even *less* standings gain.combat missions generally return 3% or even more to corporation or faction, yet combat agents always default to 'administration' or 'relation' agents that dole out nothing but... ""materials for war"" missions.now, look, i don't grind missions every day all day... i run maybe ten a month when i'm bored, so when i get a faction mission i'm hoping that it will move me forward, not be a complete and utter waste of time.in short...give combat corps combat storylines! is that stretch of logic too difficult to grasp?give hauling corps hauling missions... that will slow down the epic macro grind of gibberish alts in heavily used systems (you know, the gobbledy**** macro alts used by those corps that can promise to erect your very own pos in highsec).please... please... i hate missions, i really really do. make working toward a faction standing actually possible without the even worse drudgery of hauling missions (because *gasp* i don't macro)."
1/18/2010,"more ""industrial"" missions and less ""go there and shoot stuff"" -missions?this would be an absolutely great idea, i support this."
1/18/2010,indeed.

1/18/2010,"in a game without grinding... we have missions that are as tedious as grinding in any other game. the new epic arc missions are a step in the right direction, but still fall short.if the missions aren't going to be more engaging, at least let them be less grinding. combat missions should lead to combat storylines just as hauling missions should lead to hauling storylines. in fact, there are a dozen different types of agents. this would be fine if the missions were engaging and felt unified in some way. as it is, it just makes missions more grinding."
1/18/2010,"suicide ganking can currently be done essentially for free, using disposable trial account alts and insurable ships. in fact it is arguably quite easy to negate the security status penalty with regular mission running (especially when you compare it to the time it may take the victim to recover from the loss). this goes against the whole ""consequences for your actions"" paradigm, and throws ""risk vs reward"" concept completely out of the window.i propose the following changes to make it more balanced:- for trial accounts, disable the ability to aggress players that aren't flagged towards them- for regular accounts, disable the ability to recycle characters with negative security status- remove insurance payouts for ships destroyed by concord- adjust the security status penalties based on the victim's ship class (destroying a mining vessel or a hauler should result in much higher penalty than destroying a combat ship)"
1/18/2010,"trial pirates?please, no.terrible idea.good idea, although this has already been suggested many, many times before..... no. this doesn't even make sense, you should be punished more for shooting at newbs? this is eve, remember?sorry, i can't support this."
1/18/2010,"just the opposite. being a pirate should have its consequences (like being restricted to low security space). trial accounts are an easy way to bypass this, and therefore should not be able to pirate.actually, it is already a petitionable exploit to recycle a suicide ganking character withot gm's permission. but it's hardly ever enforced because nobody knows about it.you should be punished more for shooting ships that can't shoot back. if you are shooting miners and haulers, you obviously want to be a pirate - and pirates belong in low/nullsec. and eve is not all about shooting newbs, you know."
1/18/2010,"perhaps an easier way to implement the intent of the 'no recycling negative sec status characters'(which is silly, because being negative status itself shouldn't ever be penalised outside gameplay) idea would be to say 'no recycling characters within a month of being concord-ed'?but that said i'm still a bit iffy on this idea.."
1/18/2010,"this is against the eula anyway. i know some of my friends got warnings for it. theres a way around it however. using buddy program:1 - sent urself buddy invite2 - spend 14 days training for thrasher w/ 3 chars.3 - activate account with plex.4 - main account gets 30 free days5 - use the 3 chars for ganking6 - repeat.i.e, you get the second account for a month, paying for it, instead of your main. thus essentially free.this is not against the eula, though recycling characters for the purpose of avoiding the consequences of a negative sec status is."
1/18/2010,"(cba to edit quotes)1) being restricted to lowsec and not being able to shoot at people who haven't agressed you is two completely different things.i fail to see your point here, though - you want suicide gankers out of highsec, or what?i can understand the cost/benefit of sgank (insurance), but other than that, no.2) as ti'anla suggested, 30 days of ""from getting concord'd"" would prevent this, pretty much.3) in eve, you care about what you have. (and perhaps corp and alliance).if you lose isk, thats a problem for you. if other people gain (or lose) isk - why should you care?so, you would just want all combat ships in lowsec/0.0, and all miners could then mine veldspar in highsec?>9000) hitting the wallet of suicide gankers is fine with me. restricting what they can do is not. (except from them getting gibbed by c when they enter highsec)"
1/18/2010,"if you get concordokken, you should only receive a 50% insurance payout. that's probably all that really needs to happen and the rest would start to self-correct.it's just enough of a penalty that it would dissuade many if not the majority of alt recyclers and would still give new players who 'accidentally' blow themselves up enough compensation to recover and still learn about eve's loss consequences (careful with that smartbomb eugene).otherwise, make tech ii ship insurance in-line with tech i if you want ""balance"". suicide gankers can still get their highsec jollies, but less players would likely rage-quit because they could at least buy adequate insurance as an option/defense."
1/18/2010,"pretty much, yeah."
1/18/2010,"actually, it is already a petitionable exploit to recycle a suicide ganking character withot gm's permission. but it's hardly ever enforced because nobody knows about it. just how often do you see someone do this, since you can't watch their account? imo this should be implimented, or the ""delete a character with negative sec status"" process should require a gm's approval before you can do this - ""petionable exploit"" means it's not going to get noticed most of the time because nobody will see it when it happens the huge majority of the time."
1/18/2010,"not supported.suicide ganking is currently balanced.the only reason ganking is 'free' now is because miners and mr's are selling their minerals too cheap. if they would simply raise the price of minerals above the insurance floor, ganking would become more expensive - and less common. (like it was, oh, 6 months ago - before trit values crashed.) really, the power is in their hands already.no need to rely on ccp to stack the insurance system, (which removes all ganking risk from the miners and places it squarely on the haulers....)"
1/18/2010,please... stop spraying that useless bullcrap around.you and i know that is the biggest pile of garbage we've ever heard.it was funny the first dozen times and now its just out of hand.your just covering up the fact you don't want to lose your precious insurance when you get concord'd.mineral prices are crashing.... it's not as profitable as it used to be to mine in high sec... so your argument is totally bogus.that's why i moved out to null sec... better minerals means more profit.now i don't agree with this proposal but i whole heartedly agree that insurance should not be paid when you get concord'd or self destruct.you can suicide gank all you want... but no more free ships. you want to come after me? i wan't to know your paying for it.sec status isn't good enough of a cost... its all to easy to grind up.you want to impact the market? go gank mission runners! oh wait.. you won't... too expensive and they just might shoot back!poor poor baby.
1/18/2010,"slight change:remove insurance for concord bbq unless the pilot you shot at is in your gang, so just in case you accidentally hit the railgun instead of the remote repper in your mixed-corp (or alliance, unless they've repaired that) fleet you'll get your payout.i don't imagine that people will accept random gang invites (it happens, yeah) very often, so that solves the 'suicide gank' issue without breaking the insurance system in (generally) legitimate cases.i like the idea of not being able to recycle characters that have received more than 1 concord loss in the last 30 days (1 is understandable, 10 is not)... perhaps if the character is less than 90 days old and -5 due to direct concord action they should not be 'recyclable' at all until their sec status is returned to zero. lowering sec status in 0.4 or below should not carry this penalty.that'll kick the alt recycling revolving door squarely in the gonads. won't slow down those exploiting the plex system, however."
1/18/2010,"drake;nah, you're only covering up the fact that your thick monkey cranium doesn't understand economics. fact: eight or nine months ago, there were far fewer complaints about suicide ganking.ccp had already nerfed it, after all. but since then...something changed.fact: insurance hasn't changed in years. its not like insurance was changed by ccp in the last patch, and suddenly suicide ganking became a 'problem'. something else must have changed......hmmmm...fact: suicide ganking is cheap because minerals (thus, t1 ships) are cheap.and minerals are cheap because miners and mr's choose to sell them to us cheap. its their choice, as they are the ones that push the 'sell button.' they willingly hand a loaded gun (cheap t1 ships) to those who would destroy them (gankers). not smart, but, thats carebears for you.fact: if mineral prices go up, suicide ganking becomes less common. its quite easy to understand - more expensive t1 ships = more isk cost to ganking = less people do it, and less forum whining.if you think 'cheap ganking' is a problem, the best way to solve it is to drive mineral prices up so it because 'expensive ganking.' lots of ways to do that, but really, its not my concern. if miners and mrs insist on selling their labor for pennies, i'm not going to stop them. oh, yeah - not supported, again."
1/18/2010,"how about true facts:1: fact: eight or nine months ago, there were still a lot of complainers about suicide ganking. its about as old as eve is alive. 2: insurance hasn't changed you are correct. however, nothing else related to suicide ganking has changed besides concord's reaction.3: uhh, yeah, this is due to supply vs demand. currently the demand is that minerals are cheap. this is basic economics. you want to sell high? go right ahead. you'll get a lot more people willing to undercut you. 4: mineral prices going up will not change suicide ganking. quit trying to be an economist because you have no real idea how gankers are doing this."
1/18/2010,"1: yes, there were complainers then too - some will complain until suicide ganking disappears entirely. read close - i said less complaining then. i win. +1 for me.2. apparently you agree with me here. insurance hasn't changed, eve's playerbase hasn't radically changed - the increase in ganking can, thus, only be attributed to cheaper t1 ships. +2 for me.3. duh, of course its supply and demand. huge supply, weak demand = cheap mins. the point i was making? way too many minerals out there. suicide ganking both increases demand and reduces supply. its a win-win. ccp should be encouraging more of it - not nerfing it. making life easier for carebears only means even more minerals than the current glut we have now. +3 for me.4. i am a ganker. i know how gankers are 'doing it'.removing insurance would do precisely nothing to dessie-gang gankers. solo bc/bs gankers, however, would no longer be able to target miners, as the cost would be too high. (after all, hulks only drop about 5-8m isk in mods) only haulers would be valid targets. +4 for me.sorry to say, but....you lose!"
1/18/2010,since you claim to be such an expert... why don't you go try to mine for a month and then come back here and tell me what you believe to be so true.put your money where your mouth is hot shot.oh and make sure your mining near a major mission hub/market hub smarty pants.let's make this a real clear lesson as to why this is continuing to be a problem for industrialists.furthermore.... don't even bother insuring your suicide ganking ships!
1/18/2010,"soooo.....i should start mining and become part of the problem? much better that i gank and be part of the solution.second: i have a mining alt. he flies a hulk/orca but i don't mine much anymore because trit prices have crashed. never been ganked, because i know exactly how ganking works and how to maximize ehp (lowslots/rigs - not just for cargoexpanders!!!) and minimize risk (um, stay aligned, stay atk)during hulkaggedon i mined for a few hours (in a covetor) just to see if i'd get attacked.....and i didn't.third, as far as putting my money where my mouth is - you don't want to go there, son. i've lost more isk to suicide ganking in 12 months, than you've probably ever seen. as in multiple freighters, loaded, blown up in uedama. of course, i differ from you, in that i don't whine about it - i consider it the cost of doing business and take precautions to reduce the chance of it happening the next time."
1/18/2010,the bold print says mountains.as for the '3rd' point.... yeah right.and i ain't your son... pops.
1/18/2010,"nice thing about gcc's - give you 15 minutes for posting.trit prices crashed - so i choose not to mine.doesn't mean as much as you think, kid.when trit was around 4.20/unit, it was worth it to mine once in awhile, if i felt really lazy. at 2.50/unit - i'd rather spend more time driving freighters and adjusting trade orders. rational behavior - but you wouldn't know much about that, now, would you?high-sec mins price crash? omg mine more veld!!! is not smart play, but that is exactly what is happening.mineral prices are driven straight down to the floor because of 'too many miners/mr's'. its not something that is 'happening' to them. they are simply doing it to themselves.yep, i've lost far more than you will ever have. not that losing freighters to suicide ganks is something to be proud of, but safe to say, i've been on both sides of the equation."
1/18/2010,"yeah, this is a clearly missing feature. when i'm setting up an alt to do a particular job and not train indefinitely, being able to turn their training on and off at need, without wasting time, is something i really wish for, but that i can't practically do at present. similarly, the ability to pause training on a different character on the same account would make multi-character training work much more cleanly. supported."
1/18/2010,"so i posted this in the future ideas sub section, and i was told to look for a similar thread in this section. i'm lazy... so i thought i'd just post this fresh in here, as told by me.""i, like i believe most players do, will often dump a lot of loot in ""home station"" to run more missions faster, then sell all the loot once. often times, when faced with too much loot to sell, one will reprocess everything, and sell the remaining ore. this is a bit contrary to the idea of making money, as sometimes, you refine something that was worth a lot more isk then the material it refined for. my suggestion is this. when we view our assets, either on the items screen, or the assets screen, can you add a tab that will show the meta level of an item, similar to the quantity tab? i feel this would eliminate a lot of heartache associated with selling loot. thank you for your time.""yeah..."
1/18/2010,"somewhere somebody already requested a ""sort by meta level"" and apparently ccp said ""yes"", so dunno if this proposal is necessary."
1/18/2010,i want this!
1/18/2010,i love the rook just the way it is. long targeting range means i can deal with serpentis at maximum range!
1/18/2010,"after recently being thrust into the laggy events that is 0.0 sov i wish to re-open the subject about local chat.it is marmite, you love or hate it and there is alot of suggestions to change it. before i made this thread i did try to read most of the local changes threads to see if i was repeating an idea but i could not find it.here is my suggestion:when a 0.0 alliance decides to join up with other alliances to take sov of another system the amount of people in local normally sticks at around 200 and then fluxuates from 50-1000 over time depending on the actions taken in nearby systems or in that that system. with 1000 people in a system no one really needs local chat any more. any logistical benefits of local are rendered utterly useless, any chat options used in local are merely for spam, messing up the server, insults or general useless garbage that people spurt because they simply can. my proposal is to limit local, maybe depending on average players in system, so that when the system does get to 400+ people you are unable to talk in local.the only disadvantage to this would be the high sec hub systems like jita, however those systems can be excluded from the limitation because there is always a use for local in high sec space. 0.0 space however local is only used for intel gathering. if there is anything worth saying in 0.0 it is done behind closed doors with diplomats, private chats or the like.the benefits?:- with the limitation you dont have to worry about absolute and total garbage spam into local, administrators would not be called on so regularily to check the local chat to make sure there is no violations of policies.- the even of sending everyone in a 1000 strong system the same litter of garbage would no doubt effect the server. even if it is a small amount next to say drones, every little helps when it comes to 0.0. i think everyone can say that any way to reduce lag from large fleet fights in 0.0 without having to tell ccp when you're going to do it, how you're going to do it, the numbers involved, the time and what you had for breakfast is a good thing.i currently know no reason for local chat to be used in a large scale fight situation or even just a large amount of people in 0.0 space. the downsides?:- you are unable to spam funny or obscene links in local- you are unable to say funny comments or insult others in local during large scale operations or high numbers of people in localthe list of downsides goes on, but the idea is roughly the same.thoughts?"
1/18/2010,"this, pleasei think if i have to goa: log an alt and hunt down a bunch of omberb: chase around the market for some and spend ages tracking it down via unsorted 'deliveries' uii think i'll just hang myself. :("
1/18/2010,"i don't think this was brought up on the 17th so could someone raise it, even it is just under any other business (aob) the experimental gallente storyline missions which are causing huge problems for gallente missions runners. it essentially makes us gank bait in low sec and fw systems and makes raising faction tedious to impossible especially if you get one of these badly thought out storylines 4 times in a row (e.g. after running 64 normal missions).the assembly hall proposal is here:"
1/18/2010,"all storyline missions are abysmally badly implemented and executed.there are not enough of them, variety wise, compared to standard missions. they always seem 100% opposite to the type of agent the pilot is currently using (combat mission runners get hauling missions <materials for war is a slap in the face waste of effort; minimal standings gain and it comes up 99.9% of the time for all of my mission running chars> while non-combat mission runners tend to get combat mission storylines).and they're just flat out stupid, seeming to have no bearing or relation at all on the faction that the pilot is working for. the minmatar 'materials for war' mission is 100% identical to the amarr or gallente.in closing, the mission design team in atlanta needs to get off their collective asses and put some thought, variety, and depth into these 'imporant' missions."

1/19/2010,"/signed.to get around the extra drone space made with another bay, i have a suggestion.being able to right click on selected drones, and put them into repair mode.this mode would last for various lengths, depending on the size and make them unusable by placing them in the repair bay, until finished.whilst in repair mode, the drone bay remains locked from launching or adding drones."
1/19/2010,"just have it as a right-click on drones in bay and have it consume electrical and mechanical parts. yeah, both.this should only apply to fighters and fighter bombers, not any other drones."
1/19/2010,not supported.

1/19/2010,"1. this is a ship balance thread. you propose boosting certain ships - you must therefore believe that those ships are underpowered relative to their competitors and require boosting. the current nature of the kinetic bonus simply means that no investment of sp is required for the pilot to deal the damage around which the ships are balanced. i don't see why you would introduce the requirement to train the skill to v to gain the dps output around which the ship is balanced, unless you wanted to change that damage output - and changing ship combat capability is a ship balance issue. i'm afraid that there's nothing more to it and this thread will garner no serious support until you appreciate this. ask yourself - why has a csm member not supported this thread?2. show me. just copy and paste the appropriate post in here, or link to the thread in question. i don't see why you're so reticent to do such a simple task."
1/19/2010,there is no point in discussing with dav.he keeps reposting his arguments as absolute truth even after they have been shown to be flawed. likewise he conveniently ignores the good arguments made against is proposal. much like a fanatic he shows no culture of debate.
1/19/2010,"against... the arguments given are so tuned in favor of the ""idea"" i cant support it.if this would happen minmatar would revolt against their ""falloff"", gallente against their drones that can be shot and amarr against their cap-hungry-guns and wasted cap-bonuses on ships.at least they could ask dav to write them some one-sided charts and statistics about the problems."
1/19/2010,not unless it comes with variable damage type hybrids and lasers. otherwise this proposal is way overpowered.
1/19/2010,"so many noobs here who have absolutly no idea about balance.is it that hard to understand, that missiles were designed with fully changeable dmg type in mind ,and kinetic only takes this bonus away,making caldari missile ships with kinetic bonuses weak?also if those ships are balanced at lvl1 vs other races ships at lvl1 , then at lvl5 kinetic bonused ships are weaker than other races ships at lvl5.also i see much less missile ships ,except drake which is good only because of its tank and fitting ability, than turret ships. only a few cerberus because caldari can bring this or the even more sucky eagle at sniper hac ops."
1/19/2010,"thats because my arguments are absolute truth.whats more you know they are correct.if a 5%kin bonus was not a weaker bonus than a 5%rof bonus , nobody would be objecting so strongly.so against arguments generally break down to , yeah the 5% bonus is rubish but its ok because its caldari and caldari having a bonus that equal to other races would make caldari overpowered.caldari ships are not overpowered or even in balance with other ships atm.even some of the detractors in this post can see this.why people have such a tough time putting it together is beyond me.all races training should be equally valuable.all races should get use full use of there damage bonus where ships get damage bonuses.bonuses should not clash with tactics.if some ships become op they can always be tweaked afterwards.the only ship i can see possible being an issue is the drake because it has the great 5% per level resists bonus.so maybe the drake gets something else instead of rof|dpl."
1/19/2010,"not supported as a caldari missile user. my kinetic bonused caracals and drakes can already own missions at their respective levels without effort.edit: nvm, i'll support this topic as it will make my ships more powerful!"
1/19/2010,"at least you were honest, unlike most of the people here."
1/19/2010,"missions.... anyway ishtar >>>> cerb for every mission.or you could use the nighthawk which is good in pve ,but very weak in pvp. anyway it is still only mission ,not those cant be done with any other races as good as caldari can."
1/19/2010,"aineko speaks the truth.your arguments are not absolute truth. face it. it's obviously a weaker bonus, nobody is denying that...but that doesn't mean that a rof bonus is in order. that would be unfair to other races, and completely unnecessary.some caldari ships are rubbish because of ship problems, or because of missile problems, not because of bonus problems. look at the missiles or the ship's construction. not the bonus. bonus is fine.by your logic, i should be arguing this point: gallente blasters should be the highest dps weapons in the game, so instead of 5% damage or rof per level, i should get 15% damage or rof per level!!! otherwise it's not fair blasters don't do enough damage we get same bonus as everybody else!!!!"
1/19/2010,"alternatively, what about a complete revamp of caldari ships to balance them out? :p"
1/19/2010,that would be good.
1/19/2010,"yes because this is totally a how can i increase my isk/hr running level 3 missions in a drake thread, you nailed it champ."
1/19/2010,signed !
1/19/2010,sounds like fun.
1/19/2010,"i can support this, yeah. one point though - you're wrong about scan probes. deep space probes are an expanded version of combat probes, not of core, and as such the skill requirements are perfectly in line with where they should be."
1/19/2010,"eve's use of fonts is among the worst i've ever seen in any game. the fixed tiny font size bothers me at times(and i'm 24 and 20/20), the lookalike letters(li, o0, 6g&, etc.) are ridiculous, and it's just generally unattractive. this isn't the only thing that needs fixing, but it's certainly one of them."
1/19/2010,yes please the fonts are way to small for older people and options to make them bigger are not enough.
1/19/2010,my girlfriend couldn't play eve on her projector because the fonts were too damn small. add options for larger fonts!
1/19/2010,"i would suggest not only allowing larger fonts, but also to revisit the entire font choice as it stands. identical letters/numbers is sometimes an issue (was it a capital 'o' or was it 'zero'?). at least in chat, an option should be given to allow us to chose a font we are most comfortable with."
1/19/2010,"good idea, bad implementation.please keep the flavor text folk away from game design and balance.they don't know wtf they're doing."
1/19/2010,"i will support this as i don't think it will do anything to further it's alleged aim of introducing pvers to fw/pvp, then again for most pvers, all the isk in china wouldn't be enough.however, i would like to tell the op that calling for the dev team's sacking over this minor **** up is frankly ridiculous and demonstrates quite a shocking level of ignorance over what is/has been occurring in the rest of the game. your pompous, self important, carebear obsessed rant made me lol so much that i almost did not support the topic. i mean really, hold an investigation into why ccp had the audacity to even think about doing this to the almighty carebear population ? oh the horror ! someone call the un at once."
1/19/2010,"also, are you by any chance an alt of a ****ed of main who has been killed by bellum eternus ...real coincidence with ur name if not"
1/19/2010,"kudos to the last 2 posts. it would be unfortunate if this proposal got lost behind walls of rant-text!these storylines are an experiment.... a badly designed, poorly implemented experiment.here's hoping that both ccp and our representatives on the csm can filter out the background to focus on the very good points raised so far!note: already supported so not stacking the results w/ a 2nd thumbs up."
1/19/2010,"insa, thanks for the support.eternal is an aspiring pvp alt of a carebear main. it is indeed a spoof of bellum eternus, and the corp name is a spoof of every pvp hardcore corp name i have ever come across. a couple of months back when bellum was doing his carebear wind-up posts i started a new one under this alt in the same style but by the content obviously a **** take of bellum. however it was the carebears who made it funny by responding as if it was bellum and they put lots of arguments why pve is not imbalanced, good for the game and pays ccp to develop the game etc.this went on for several pages and bellum replied saying how funny he found it that pve people thought the post was a) him b)took it seriously.after that i was inspired to keep this alt and train him up for fw and pvp. i aim to be the worst pvper in eve. please pod me sometime.i do want questions asked about ccp, the storyline team and this rushed content not because of any feeling of carebear self-importance but basic issues about: a) quality assurance - how does stuff this badly thought through get thrown straight in for players? by their own admission they rushed it into dominion because of their excitement. in it development this is amateur.b) how did a pve orientated team ever think that content designed like this would be a good idea? this does raise issues about their knowledge and understanding of the pve playerbase. a competence issue, these people are paid with our money.c)borking storyline content like this for only one faction has consequences, since storylines are the only way of raising faction.d) no testing at all before implementation - not on sisi; not even a run it past the csm members as a concept. in these days of interwebs communications, focus groups, online questionnaires it is easy to test ideas. also testing in game stuff is much more than just bug hunting it is also about testing game play and impacts. none of this was done, all that happened was some hyperactive developers in their group think excitement threw this crap at gallente players with no fore thought.e) they said it was experimental content but apart from us whining on forums they put in no feedback mechanism aimed specifically at this content. so you set up an experiment but forget to put in a mechanism for collecting feedback? they just left it to chance, that people like me would whine; no little questionnaire if you tried it, did it, abandoned it, turned it down - no rating, no comments collected? i have done this for websites and it isn't rocket science to do. they just pulled it out of thin air, with no clear plan, rushed it through, no formal feedback mechanism, no testing in any form, no option to take part, broke faction standing gain for one faction, showed ignorance of pve players and what we want.given the background to this disaster, as a paying customer, wanting questions asked is not arrogance or self-importance but a reasonable request. it raises questions yet again about ccp's development procedures (boot.ini anyone?), competence and whether they are trustworthy (pos t2 material duping bug left in for years, t2 bpo seeding scandal, ccp staff supporting some alliances, cover ups by ccp until issues are exploded on public forums - they do not have a good history here).just as things start to pick-up ccp have a knack of mucking up. this is just one in a long line of amateur ****-ups."
1/19/2010,"ccp just finished a lot of work with planetary designs and layouts, so they might not want to delve that deeply just a few months later into planetary design. however, i would appreciate these changes.as someone who uses the scientific articles to immerse myself into the game, i think this would help me get deeper into the game, as well as others who see this game as more than the next ship to destroy or the next item to build. there is anything wrong with these behaviors - as an mmo, the game is what you make of it.supported."
1/19/2010,need to fix the planets before we move onto them. thanks for support on my topic as well.
1/19/2010,"introduction and tl;dr version.we all have seen how sov warfare is going on. the huge problem we have here is lag. as eve population is increasing, we expect to have always lag with big fights despite the introducion of all the ultimate hardware, and that's actually a gameplay mechanic issue. if we put in place a new sov capturing system, based on dominion, that compels forces to split and fight over many fights in some different solar system, we fix lag once for all and we'll have more dinamical and enjoyable fights. this would not solve problems related to timezone warfare, but those issues are pretty unsolvable given the priority of real life work and sleep over game activities."
1/19/2010,"after some battles i came to the conclusion that we still need a system that forces attackers and defenders on different battlefields. everybody knows this.in order for the game to be enjoyable we need a mechanic that forces fleet and coalitions to split over many objectives.last night there has been a fight in 49- with something like 1400 people. lag was terrible, and node crashed. and al that because the only winning strategy is to put as many pilots as you can on the same target. it is called focus fire.right now, there is no reason to split forces between different objectives, even if one of the ccp aims with dominion was forcing fleets to split.in eve focus fire is the most effective way to fight.it would be the most effective way to fight in every competition but over a certain scale usually it ceases to be the best tactic.why dominion did not succeed in splitting a big fight into smaller, less laggy fightsin real life armies and navies, forces are split for mainly 2 reason:1) weakness of critical objectives;2) lack of mobility compared to the vastness of the battlefield.so if you have to protect an important target you have to stand by it in order to be ready to fight for it, its survivability being very critical (because of its instrinsic weakness). and it makes no sense to call reinforcements from far away, because they will arrive too late (because of the mobility issue).right now all the structures that have any role in sovereignty conquest have a monstrous amount of hitpoints, and subcapital fleet and even non sieged capital fleet can be redeployed anywhere in a solar system within maximum 2 minutes. this is the complete opposite to what compels forces in real life to split.so, what i suggest?my suggestion: work on fleet mobility compared to the vastness of the battlefield.solution: increase the vastness of the battlefield from a solarsystem to a constellation (or a smaller group of stars) leave all structure hitpoints as they are now, but instead of solar system based sovereignty consider only constellation based sovereignty.if constellations are too big, just use another group-type of systems. attacker and defenders have to split over many systems, and so their mobility is reduced if confronted with the size of the battlefield. you will need to control more systems than your opponent. the side that has the higher scores gains sovereignty of the constellation. this is important: there will be only constellation-wide reinforcement timers, with all sbus, outpost and ihub exiting reinforced mode at the same time.the entrance in reinforced mode could happen in many ways, could be when all systems in the constellation have been reinforced."
1/19/2010,"interesting idea, but it comes with one obvious problem. one of the purposes of dominion was supposed to be to make sov warfare an option for smaller groups. making the minimum amount of space that can be held a constellation flips that on its head - it means you need an even bigger force to take sov, and cuts off the bottom end even more thoroughly than the old system did. it might be interesting, it could even be a good idea, but there's definitely need for caution here."
1/19/2010,"i think the idea behind dominion was to get more small groups into 0.0. the more systems/things you have to control to have sov, the larger the alliance has to be.my understanding is there are three different components to why blobs aren't formed in real warfare:1. everything has a limit to its mobility (as you said)2. there is a strategic benefit to attacking multiple locations - it prevents the defenders from being able to dig in and mass their forces - the longer a force is in place, the greater the tactical advantage they hold.3. heavily fortified locations are not self-sustaining.the reason for blob warfare is the timezone inclusiveness of eve. the very strength that allows eve to appeal to players around the world is the cause of blob warfare. even the op's idea of adding more targets spread around a constellation won't do the trick. alliances have plenty of titans and cynos to quickly take down one target, then jump to the next target. there would need to be a mechanic forcing people to hit multiple targets simultaneously to break up fleets. instead of the blockade units (which failed miserably at spreading out fleets), have the invuln/reinforcement set by another defensive structure... sort of like a rr structure.structures that have bonuses to repairing each other (think rr fleet), but will not remote rep each other if they are taking local damage (local tank has primary concern). each would obviously also have to have weapons as well to prevent a single ship sitting on each while the fleet hits a primary target.allow more than one in a system so even within a single system, fleets would be on multiple grids. allow each to have multiple system range to provide rr (perhaps constellation-wide). so the big alliances/coalitions have a dozen targets to hit at the same time. since bigger targets draw bigger fleets.this post just got way out of hand, so i'm going to make a separate new post with this idea and link it here, as well as link your idea in the new post. let people read both and decide what they prefer."
1/19/2010,"i've taken into consideration the issued you raised.1. small entities would be disadvantaged if the ""space unit"" is costellation instead of the single solar system. considerations and possible solution, if it really matterswe could use a smaller unit made of 3-4 systems instead of a whole constellation: the biggest engagements are now made of 1400 people, if you split them in 3 part you have 3 fights with 406 people (a mean) or little more if they try to move. even if the local peaked at 700, the game should be enjoyable.otherwise you could solve the problem just splitting the problem in two part: contesting sov and achieving sov. while the first part needs a lot of people usually, the second is not a problem. if you conquer the system and you want to give it to a smaller alliance, let them online the tcu in that system instead of you. 2. mobility over many system is not an issue for capital fleet considerations and possible solution, if it really matters first, if the systems are cynojammed then capitals mobility is at maximum equal to those of subcapital fleet, and only for the defenders, for they can use jumpbridges. even with cynojammers down the mobility of capital fleet is an issue because they must have enough capacitor, and if dreads are in siege you cannot move them. but anyway the defenders have convenience in keeping the cynojammer up and stop attacker's capital moves, while attacker will try to kill jbs to reduce defender's mobility.don't you see this will be a chess match with lot of tactics involved, where the smartness of the fleet commender really matters?and even if after these considerations you find mobility of capitals too high, nerf a bit their cap recharge or the level they need to jump. i think that this is not necessary btw , and i hear capital pilots alredy whining (with reason)."
1/19/2010,"every race needs ships that use every weapon type, in order to encourage cross-training. gallente missile boats are already incredibly minimal(there's the racial bomber, plus vague attempts by the eris and lachesis, and that really is it), they don't need a further nerf. if you want to buff the eris, buff its missiles, not its guns. drop 3 turrets, add 3 missiles, change the destroyer bonuses to velocity and precision of missiles, and buff the cpu until it can use 7 standard launchers sanely. it doesn't need to be a crap boat just because it's gallente and missile-based, but it does need to actually work within that role."

1/19/2010,"the destroyers are the most insanely broken in-game class that i am aware off. there starts are all over the place. they all need a look at. not jsut eris. they need to become equally usefull, i do realize that their relative unimportance is the reason they do not get much attention, but they need to be fixed sooner or later, and i would rather have it sooner"
1/19/2010,"destroers aren't ""terribly broken"". it just requires good fitting skills and a little thinking to figure out how to use them properly, which is why most people seem to have trouble with it."
1/19/2010,eris is so sexybut so bad
1/19/2010,"although the proposed insurance payout rate is still too high for my liking, at least it's better then the current situation. supported.uh huh. and is that optimal at current levels, which are roughly twice what they were not so long ago? or was the optimal when they were at an all time high, before the last fanfest?you do not make an argument for the current fixed insurance prices at all. any number of options are available to substitute insurance in order to maintain this mineral price floor. that should be a complete non-issue.say mineral basket price more then doubles, so now insurance only covers half of the hull cost, what happens to your burger flipper then? malcanis proposal would see him reasonably covered in both situations, regardless of mineral prices."
1/19/2010,"insurance definatly needs a nerf.i haven't read everything but i have an idea about an insurance nerf:only 3 levels of insurance:hisec insurance : 50% payed only if lost in hiseclowsec : 75% payed only if lost in lowsec00 : 100% payed only if lost in 0.0orthese levels for each type of current insurancethis way, concord gets nerfed and you get a new way to do risc-based insurance"
1/19/2010,"if you average over the market of all regions it becomes more difficult to manipulate. also, payout values don't have to be updated in realtime, it would be enough to adjust them once a week or even a month.i'm not sure what percentage of market value should be payed out, you'd need to do some heavier math or simulations to determine what is sane.if insurance gets an overhaul (say, making insurance payout 50% of market value)), t2 and faction ships should also be included, so they start to see at least some reasonable insurance payouts. yes, the number of moons does not scale, so this might cause some problems with goo price because of increased demand, but that's because ccp missed an opportunity to implement a system that actually scales...finally, adjust payout by another factor y if the loss was caused by concord."
1/19/2010,would also be good with export/import option. supported.
1/19/2010,"this is, if anything, too good a blocklist proposal."
1/19/2010,i of course support the op :)-t
1/19/2010,and so do i.
1/19/2010,"i think it would be nice if i could use my national identity card to log in. it's also not entirely foolproof ofc, but it is more secure than just fancy password and username."
1/19/2010,the rsa token does not have to be a hard token as detailed in a link i posted in the general sectionthis linkeven if your pc had a keylogger on it as the key is not generated on your pc they still cannot get the code to access your account. the number generated is done with an algorithm linked to your details it generates a new number every minute.at the server end it is running the same algorithm as your key generator so can verify the number entered.the cost of this technology has come down so it need not cost a fortune. the question is how much are your in game assets worth to you?
1/19/2010,sign me up.
1/19/2010,supported
1/19/2010,nothing wrong with that.
1/19/2010,these all seem like pretty cool ideas.
1/19/2010,"yeah, i suppose this makes sense. the pirate ship and pirate implant offers are fine, but there should also probably be offers for things like pirate gear and pirate pos towers/modules. they don't have to be great offers(though it is lp that can only be acquired in 0.0, so it shouldn't be too awful either), but they should exist. also, be sure to make the items that take the place of tags be thematically appropriate - drugs, people, stuff from rival factions, all that."
1/19/2010,"a lot of missions that you run give you navy tags and concord tags, but a bit of variety would be good. rival commander tags would be great, boosters, anything pirate themed.while i'd like to see any generic faction gear (pos modules, regular ship modules, etc) available, i'd also like to see other 'pirate' stuff available. maybe pirate trade goods that you could smuggle into empire and sell."
1/19/2010,"supporting this, and the option to buy a plank module for high slots."
1/19/2010,sounds like a good idea.
1/19/2010,"yes indeed. would be nice if ccp were to take a look at pirate faction implants as well - slaves, snakes, and crystals are valuable and fetch a good price, halos are pretty poor, and talismans are flat out terrible."
1/19/2010,agreed.
1/19/2010,"my alt account, which has always been paid with plex, gives me a 10-day countdown on the login screen to account expiry. my main account, which still has a credit card(albeit an expired one) attached to it, does not. change how this works so that everyone sees when their subscription expires in advance, or at least so that anyone can turn on the option. that said, a downtime-like countdown in the last hour of the subscription doe make good sense."
1/19/2010,"nah, civilian-made ships should be held together with bubblegum. i don't see any real need to make them more survivable. moving their hp into hull might work, but in order for it to make sense you'd have to pull down their shield hp, which i don't think most hulk pilots will appreciate."
1/19/2010,"yes, remote asset management needs a few improvements in this vein."
1/19/2010,"ccp is planning on rolling out new forum software soon(tm), as well as other facebook-like tools. hopefully, these ideas are already in the works. if they aren't, they should be."
1/19/2010,"i know about the spacebook thing (now called new eden), but i haven't heard anything about specific tools for proposals/csm. do you have any link?"
1/19/2010,i agree completely with the points you've raised.
1/19/2010,qft
1/19/2010,"sorry for the delayed response - stuff happened.to respond to your points in order;1) fair enough, the 'battling the lag monster' thread seems to have stagnated a bit, at the very least2*) this is already done to some degree both when testing is done and during 'normal' fleet fights; i don't think the battle reports on the various forum sections go unseen by the community-related ccp employees, who will likely subsequently deliver reports on player-satisfaction and overall service delivery back to the development team, which likely includes date, time, location and playercounts. that there's no direct feedback from them on the true 'limits', if you will, on what the server is able to handle only serves to frustrtate the players when they exceed an invisible threshold without realising it until it's too late.3*) unfortunately, the content development/concept teams and the code/server maintenance and development teams aren't quite the same thing; they may work together to implement new features, but the content guys, as an example, aren't responsible for keeping the server running smoothly. because of this, it's easier for them to lay out a roadmap of content they want to and know they can implement before date x, then give an expansion date to roll it out it - when server lag issues arise, it's not like ccp has a roadmap of things they can and will be able to do to fix it until they've worked on it.4*) as far as i'm aware, they already do this, as they have to let us know whenever they're rolling out a patch or extending a downtime for server-side maintenance as it is. they also (generally) let us know when they apply server-side hotfixes for things.5*) understandable, but keep in mind that their shareholders are likely responsible for a far larger portion of their operating revenue/sustaining costs than the portion(s) of the playerbase directly affected by the current situation that might decide to 'emoragequit'.keep in mind that if the great 0.0 powers had to leave the game, there'd be massive holes in 0.0 for empire bears previously too afraid to try to siphon themselves into, refilling the gap, growing up new powers, drawing in different players all over again.6*) this again brings us back to the issue of filing reports, which i'll cover below.the points marked with stars (you'll notice all but 1 were) are ones where your responses weren't quite answers to what i was asking.right now, your focus appears to be on getting ccp to deliver consistently frequent updates on what it is they're doing to the servers or code to try and identify, then remove lag causing issues.assuming they had to write up a report the likes of these:"
1/19/2010,"i support what this csm is trying to do, the lag yesterday in a big battle was...well it ruined the game for me at the time. ccp has got to fix these lag issues or give us solutions to avoid the lag and still enjoy all facets of the game."
1/19/2010,"i remembering talking about this and wanting it, so yeah supported."
1/19/2010,"as long as these don't even come close to obsoleting minmatar outposts, i can support it. might be interesting."
1/19/2010,good idea
1/19/2010,"wonderful idea! maybe make it so they can only be anchored in a wh class <= c4, so that rorqs wouldn't get shafted in c5/6's."
1/19/2010,that would be saying its wormhole specific. how is that fair to k-space dwellers?
1/19/2010,"sound idea. supported. if you can't see your enemy because of a technical issue related to network and servers, the least you should expect is that you don't get destroyed for it."
1/19/2010,omg i'm agreeing with a goon it isn't much fun being on a turkey shoot and its less fun being the turkey
1/19/2010,1
1/19/2010,"could be a potential exploit but, hell, couldn't be much worse than what is there now.maybe make the player visible but not targetable until he has loaded grid."
1/19/2010,"the only way i could picture this being implemented would be a client side ""i am ready"" signal, which i give people about a week to figure out how to block/delay.in theory i would love this since personally i have lost ships (and pods) before i even loaded leaving form station... but the alternative seems even worse."
1/19/2010,"good idea, grids need to expand as well. multiple times people will be at the end of a grid, than while aligning people start to go off grid."
1/19/2010,yep
1/19/2010,"wh corps have the issue of pos life and how to prevent the ease of corp theft.in an effort to provide more security while not taking away accessiblity, provide the ability for players to ""lock"" their ships into the sma with a password that would prevent other people from boarding/launching the ship. directors would maintain the ability to override said password and board/launch the ship themselves. this would allow increased security while keeping accessiblity (as in autonomous pos living) up."
1/19/2010,"nice idea, pos security is an issue and this would help"
1/19/2010,"oh yes, seconded. perhaps, even for the sake of organization, add tabs to a sma?"
1/19/2010,supported great idea
1/19/2010,passwords seem unwieldy. i'd prefer tabbing them like a corp hangar.
1/19/2010,instead of passwording set a flag of ownership on each ship.as it stands you can set a jet can to be public or private.do the same for a ship... original owner of the ship only.etc...
1/19/2010,i like it... a lot.
1/19/2010,"*shrugs*i have already admitted my guilt in thinking that i could propose and debate this issue as i'd do with adults, but in fact only you and maybe a couple more people only showed the least rational behavior and adult thinking.but then again, i wouldn't have thought that there'd be the need to educate anybody on the simple issues behind the requests.anyhow,mission bookmarks- pros (all of them potential, since you'd actually need to bookmark space to obtain any benefit. no magic wand of free isk here): <U+FFFD> great increase in mission space gameplay value thanks to the reduction of travel times. <U+FFFD> eliminates the grief and annoyment of returning to a mission (particularly important for people with social lifes). <U+FFFD> allows pve configured ships to quickly warp-out-refit-warp-in when threatened, opening a pvp scenario currently unavailable, and very interesting. <U+FFFD> streamlines salvaging/ looting in active missions- cons <U+FFFD> none. there is no automatic gain/ unbalance.mwds in acceleration gate missions- pros <U+FFFD> alternative to mission bookmarks <U+FFFD> adds variety to missions- cons <U+FFFD> potentially breaks mission scripts2d graphics additions: debris, ricochet, shells, etc.- pros <U+FFFD> makes the game battles more appealing and rich, and thus more attractive <U+FFFD> ""easy"" to implement- conss <U+FFFD> none. since they are client side only, require no network bandwidth, and can be toggled on and off as a normal video option."
1/19/2010,obviously supported :) great idea.
1/19/2010,obvious
1/19/2010,"oh yes... (and i have, while in eve university, learning, blown away a shipmate by accident for this very reason... )[it was a great demonstration of what not to do.... ]"
1/19/2010,this is one of those tiny changes that can make the difference between life and death.
1/19/2010,hi
1/19/2010,"agree with this suggestion 100%. it is way to hard to see when modules are active sometimes. i find myself tilting my ships view to see which are and which aren't and this is on a 22"" high refresh lcd."
1/19/2010,because gallente is the drone race and the current information bonuses are simply not practical. i propose that the bonuses be changed to be drone oriented.skilldrone discipline skill: 3% to drone control range per levelgang assist modulesdrone warfare link - constitution: 2% to all drone hit pointsdrone warfare link - affliction: 2% to all drone damagedrone warfare link - echo feedback: 2% to all drone speed and trackingthoughts?
1/19/2010,"all other gang link bonuses are kind of passive, your drones would get an offensive bonus. not sure that would follow the principle."
1/19/2010,"the infowar modules are useful, but they really dont belong as a gallante racial spec. since when were gallante the e-war race anyway?the whole leadership skilltree needs a little shine anyway. marlona's drone warfare link idea is a good one - but let's add a 2nd tier of offensive warfare links which are available through the lp store, at about the same lp cost level as a faction hardener - so 30-50 mill or so.1st tier:amarr: armor warfarecaldari: seige warfaregallante: suggestions...?minmatar: skirmish warfare2nd tier:amarr: cap warfarecaldari: info warfaregallante: drone warfareminmatar: suggestions...? thermodynamics bonuses?"
1/19/2010,"mini:tracking, optimal, falloff, dmg for turretsalthough it will be tough to balance,tempests with bonuses from a command ship with 3 turret gang links.would roughly mean 37.5% more alpha?that might make ganking too easy.maybe the rof rather than dmg bonus."
1/19/2010,"i made a proposal several months ago about new race gang links and was flamed to hell and back. i guess whatever is not acceptable one month, is ok a couple months later.granted a damage bonus is offensive oriented but seriously, drones need love and the info links are rarely used at all."
1/19/2010,"malcanis, those ideas look good when you put them down as a list of categories. i'd wager that they'll look much less good when you try to create three useful, balanced, interesting gang links in each of 8 categories and realize that you can find maybe 16 of the 24 you'd want."
1/19/2010,well instead of like an entire new tier of gang links. what about one new one for each race that gives a bonus to something offensive wise? they could possibly be isolated to specific weapons too instead of a general field.for example:armored warfare link - crystal synthesizer: -2% to all lasor capacitor needs.now granted it does nothing for armor but it would allow the damnation and legion to give it bonuses because it falls under that type of link.the other three races would deal with something that would make thier weapons more effective.gallente - optimal range? rof?minmitar - tracking? rof?caldari - whatever makes the explosion velocity better? other missile crap?thoughts?
1/19/2010,"as it has once been proposed, i think gallente should have assault warfare links, giving improvements to blasters, that is damage/rof, tracking and falloff. <aybe bonus to web power. drones as secondary works as well i guess."
1/19/2010,we would not want to make ganking too easy that would be bad.
1/19/2010,information warfare links are ****. only ones that do get used are armor (in rr gangs) shield (pos repping) and minnie (tackle range). this is why you see damnations and claymores and sometimes vultures die on killboardsyou dont ever see eos's. after ccp nerfed them to **** nobody's been flying them. that's because the ship is **** and information warfare links are also ****.there.i fully support any change for the better of gallente gang mods
1/19/2010,"yeah, perfectly sensible."
1/19/2010,supported.
1/19/2010,supporting
1/19/2010,"supported, but more one thing, make shotable, not just enable smartbombing them."
1/19/2010,totally not supported. everyone supporting this idea are just the guys who get killed when they're probed out. fail more.
1/19/2010,no way!remove probes from overview period
1/19/2010,stupid that you cant add it.
1/19/2010,i'll support this if pos's are removed from wh space.so no.
1/19/2010,"i explore for a living and so far, i've never lost a ship from being probed out and busted in a site (lost one from warping into a site where the gate was camped, and one from fleeing probers to run into their buddies gatecamp, mind you). i can use the scanner to find them sufficiently well, but it's just annoying because it's so badly designed. not ""challenging"", not skilful, just tedious. if probes were added to the overview, i'd check just as often as i do now and have the same chances of getting caught--only i'd be less annoyed in the process by wading through the same two dozen small railgun batteries.being able to filter probes wouldn't save people who forget to scan / align, and a cumbersome, boring interface is not the right way to balance anything."
1/19/2010,fantastic idea that only makes sense. those of us who use the ds religiously while mining/gassing/doing a combat site would love this option.
1/19/2010,"not supported, just lazy ppl wanting a 1 click notification that someone is looking for them... too easy, and no i am not a pirate."
1/19/2010,"i would have had more sympathy for that argument back when a scan for a maxed-out prober would take about 20 seconds, and it wasn't possible to locate someone and then scan them down in such rapid sequence."
1/19/2010,"you realize you can already see probes using your directional scanner, right? this isn't really about adding anything, but being able to filter out the rest of the junk."
1/19/2010,dust 514 is soon finished and took alot of time to develop. i as a eve player payed for that time with my eve subscription and i havnt got anything back... accept a buggy dominion were fleet fights are lag fests and node crash parties and taking a system takes longer shooting tcu's than posses in ahpocoryphia. my proposal is to reimburs lost develop time with extra attention (read more develop time) when dust hits the community.
1/19/2010,"are you saying that ccp isn't allowed to make money?if ccp decides to invest some of that money they earned from eve, into another mmo called dust 514, that is fine with me.besides, wasn't it ccp shanghai (?) or something that was working with dust 514?"
1/19/2010,"correct. the normal eve team is still working on eve, iirc.-t'amber"
1/19/2010,"omg you should ask someone to hug you if you need attention that badly.anyway back to your idea, i guess you didnt watch the video from the fanfest?if you did, you would have known that:a) the dust team was independent from the normal eve teamb) that lot of improvements for dust/incarna benefit the normal eve code base aswell (coreification, new inventory system)c) especially coreification made sure that improvements benefit all parts of eve and not just e.g. dust or incarna or eve itself.last but not least i have to say your attitude is amazing. you pay 15 bucks and behave like you would put millions into ccp. wow just wow."
1/19/2010,my proposal is that you stop making proposals.
1/19/2010,is there any way to vote mr lab rat off the island?
1/19/2010,not supported due to op failing at corporate structure 101 >.>
1/19/2010,you.... give me all of your stuff... transfer your chars over... and leave.that should be compensation enough for making me read your proposal.
1/19/2010,"lab rat, you spelled your corp name wrong. red green is very disappointed with you. also, your proposal is crazy and makes no sense."
1/19/2010,"the op may need to take a refresher on business finance - specifically in regards to investments. rarely are business investments completely mutually exclusive. money is only one part of the assets that go into an investment. money is the only easily reassigned asset between different investments. it may also be to the op's benefit to review how foreign investments in china work. the op seems to imply ccp shanghai is a wholly owned subsidiary of ccp. pretty sure it is an fie (foreign invested enterprise). as foreign companies/persons are not allowed to directly hire chinese citizens in china, ccp shanghai is likely a joint venture with chinese venture capitalists. foreigners can only own/contribute up to 50% of the fie. so, ccp games paid (at most) 50% of the cost to develop dust 514 and it is likely the venture capitalists wouldn't have plunked down their half (or more) of the money for an expansion provided for free to gamers."
1/19/2010,"i think the idea behind dominion was to get more small groups into 0.0. the more systems/things you have to control to have sov, the larger the alliance has to be.there are three different components that prevent blobs from forming in real wars:1. everything has a limit to its mobility (as you said)2. there is a strategic benefit to attacking multiple locations - it prevents the defenders from being able to dig in and mass their forces - the longer a force is in place, the greater the tactical advantage they hold.3. heavily fortified locations are not self-sustaining.the reason for blob warfare is the timezone inclusiveness of eve. the very strength that allows eve to appeal to players around the world is the cause of blob warfare. alliances have plenty of titans and cynos to create a very mobile blob. to break up fleets in eve, a mechanic forcing people to hit multiple targets simultaneously is needed. instead of the blockade units (which failed miserably at spreading out fleets), have the invuln/reinforcement set by another defensive structure... sort of like a rr structure.structures that have bonuses to repairing each other (think rr fleet), but will not remote rep each other if they are taking local damage (unlike an organized rr fleet). each would obviously also need defensive weapons as well to prevent a single ship sitting on each while the fleet hits a primary target.allow more than one in a system so even within a single system, fleets would be on multiple grids. allow each to have a multiple system range for rr - maybe constellation-wide. since bigger targets draw bigger fleets, the bigger the alliances/coalitions attacking/defending, the more targets have to be hit at the same time. this thread originally was a suggestion for changes for this post. you can read both and decide if either is better than the current system."
1/19/2010,"since i hope that sov war is fixed once for all as soon as possible, i support this thread ad hope csm will discuss on this topic and see all the proposals."
1/19/2010,"if only we had something to clear grids of blobs. i don't know, something that could simply wipe out a fleet of battleships and keep the local counts down so the node would stay stable. of course, this device, or whatever it would be, would have to cost an enormous amount of isk and time to build so that in order to field it you would have to risk tremendous alliance assets. if implemented, these devices could even have the side effect of fleets splitting up onto multiple grids in order to not put all eggs in one basket, further helping node stability.what do you think?"
1/19/2010,bump as this is more of a technical issue.after all...would you enjoy fps games if your real fov was in error 5-15 degrees to the left or right of true center mass?
1/19/2010,"i'd recently got the scanning helper thing from the grismar wiki to check on this, when experiencing the issue while trying to use directional in a vigil - turns out the issue is the ship centers (the block) has moved for some ships, which makes the old thing of aligning a scan target with the block useless, since the directional is based on the center of your view, not where that block is...in some other ships it does feel like something else is wrong though, so i can entirely support finding a way to make the directional scanner more practical for everyday usage."
1/19/2010,"this could be why i've never noticed this, and i am a very heavy d-scan user. if you zoom out so that the block is effectively your entire ship does the problem go away?"
1/19/2010,"supported, just hilarious that the uk terrorist gankers want this fixed"
1/19/2010,"i don't usually get down to 5 degrees, because i can never seem to align the camera properly. interesting to know that this is why. yes, fix it please. also, some kind of visual display of where is being scanned would be very nice."
1/19/2010,"i never had that issue as i dont use the block, i just point the middle of the screen (camera) in direction of what i want to scan, but if it is a bug, it deserves fixin'."
1/19/2010,"yeah, i agree"
1/19/2010,"the 10 person watchlist size is too small for logistic pilots, even with broadcasts we should be able to see whos taking damage.why bother with a 10 person list size, if lagg is an issue make it the size of a full wing ( 50 people )"

1/19/2010,"9. a state in which the supreme power is held by the people; a republican or democratic state.from dictionary.com's definition of 'commonwealth'.y'know, while we're assuming peoples' names have anything to do with the way they play eve. though, i don't deny being a big ol' meaniehead in empire to those who shoot before they think. *edit* okay, i actually went through the trouble of reading through your walls of text (which have now burned an inverted image into my eyes, thanks), and feel that my summary was actually quite accurate.on the whole, it's only reasonable to expect that, if you shoot someone, they can shoot back. there's an aggression timer in the top-left of your screen whenever you're shooting npcs that starts at 15 minutes; i'm assuming you've moused over that at least once and noticed that it listed the npcs you were shooting at - it does the same when you shoot at players.if i'm not mistaken, the first time you ever engage someone that's stolen from you, you get a warning - i could very well be wrong on this - assuming you don't, it's still only reasonable to expect that they are perfectly entitled to shoot back at you.what happened to you in your mission was not griefing, that was normal, unadulterated, fair play. what happened to you while you were mining was not griefing, that was normal, silly, fair play.there is nothing here for ccp to 'improve', as as things stand, they have already afforded those that feel they are being 'griefed' with a variety of tools to 'get theirs back' with, and whenever those tools are used, and ultimately failed with, those that tried to use them and failed cannot accept that they didn't know what they were getting themselves into and died as a result, and then feel cheated.moral of the story: if you can't afford to lose it, don't use it."
1/19/2010,"physically more correct planets and atmospheres - another thing that should be done before dust.i'll go ahead and support this one also. mostly the part about 'layered interaction' - as i think that as podpilot current design of being able to intearct with the surface with just policy level is ok. in the atmospheric layers however i would love to see ability to deploy some specific structures, even if they would be controlled by hired dusters."
1/19/2010,i can agree with this.
1/19/2010,"there are two reasons why shield tanks aren't as prevalent as you think they should be.1) there are 2.5 races that armor tank and only 1.5 that shield tank (minmatar can do both well). that means, on average, we shouldn't see more than 37.5% shield tanked ships in a mixed gang.2) missiles generally aren't used for fleet pvp. since the most notable shield tankers are the caldari, that puts them at a penalty. however, they have the specialized ships for pvp (ecm boats and tacklers).i'll agree that gang bonuses are kinda out of whack, but that is far from examining and changing the whole mechanic. i see no reason to support this proposal in it's current iteration."
1/19/2010,"some few things need a bit a tweaking, like local armor reps and shield transporters, but the overall balance between armor and shield is one of things that don't need fixing."
1/19/2010,yes
1/19/2010,"the fact the defender has the advantage in picking when the r/f timed fight occurs in a sense is good. you don't want the systems to flip too easily or folks won't invest in the upgrades. by the same token, the sbu's are so fragile compared to the sov structures themselves that they wind up dead in a couple of minutes. the race between aaa/sys-k/it etc and goons demonstrated that last night in spades. the decision to race goons was fail for aaa etc. you gotta take them on in a big fleet fight or bring a bazillion dreads to hit the ihub.i think the sbu ehp should be increased a tad but most of all, ccp needs to sort out the node crashes. the current fights in 49- are no bigger than delve ii yet we have crippling lag, crashes, rollbacks and black screens on log in which will screw one side or the other.ccp has to know that ****ing off ~1,300 people daily is a bad move. those same folks are the ones with multiple accounts, greatest longevity and contribute a large chunk of their bottom line income. get information out there about the issue and get some test patches up to try to get this stuff sorted."
1/19/2010,"ccp's economist already keeps game-wide price indexes, and has said in past that if they ever get unhappy with existing monetary policy, they have both isk taps and isk sinks that they can bring online to balance things out. this seems unnecessary to me."
1/19/2010,"judging by the other thread you brought up, i am assuming that you mean that you want keep at range to work for any one given object, not that you want a ""keep at range from all objects"" button. if i understand you correctly, i can support that."
1/19/2010,"the epic story lines are good, and i'd love to see regular storylines that were (admittedly much smaller) versions.story line missions should be 2-4 missions in length, all from the same agent, and all offer small increases with a big payoff at the end. write 10 trade, 10 combat and 10 courier for each level and you're done. i really like the potential in the mission system, but it is let down by a lack of new content being added to it. (in favour of new, admittedly pretty great, things like epic arcs)"
1/19/2010,"it's a good idea, but i don't think it's quite the right approach."
1/19/2010,there are plenty of ways to get a jump clone made for you. it also only takes about a week of standings grinding to get up enough to install one.
1/19/2010,"yeah, the star map looks cool and is okay for some purposes, but it's a real pain to move around it or to limit the view to only the part you're interested in. improvements would be very nice."
1/19/2010,"suicide ganking aside, the whole premise of having insurance in new eden is kind of silly. it only exists because the magical npc bank never runs out of isk. what rational mind would insure a ship in a galaxy at a constant state of conflict? removing insurance entirely would be a stronger solution, giving the players complete control over the market.barring that, removing insurance from concord-killed losses makes perfect sense. having the npc-police alliance blow up your ship and then make sure you are paid for it is nonsensical."
1/19/2010,"i posted this on page six or something of a coad thread, but the chances of it being noticed there are zero. apologies for cross-posting, but this is a serious proposal.there seems to be a very healthy market in sovereignty blockade units. they get placed in systems, they get blown up, and people buy new ones to place again.most useful items in this game are manufactured by players, and thats one of the great things about eve. why are sovereignty blockade units different?could we ask ccp to seed some blueprints on the market so my industrial alt can make sovereignty blockade units? some corps are spending billions on these, and it's a shame for all that isk to go to waste."
1/19/2010,game mechanics:sov blockade units anchorable by already sov holding alliances to prevent a defender from anchoring their owns thus securing the system beforehand to prevent station or ihub reinforcing to a conquerable state by simply offlining the sbus when station/ihub exiting reinforced mode and sending them back into invulnerable state needs a look into

1/20/2010,"yay, ccp gave them some love: ""patches notes dominion 1.1: ships with a covert jump portal generator can now bridge to a cynosural generator array as well as a cynosural field.""however they need more love, they are still broken...."
1/20/2010,"let me start off by saying that i love my blasters and have generally little experience with lasers, so feel free to ignore whatever i say about them (which isn't much).i am entirely open for the suggestion that the best blaster boost is a pulse laser nerf, but i think that's equally hard to do ""right"". the recent projectile changes seem to be a success though.i'd like to propose some ideas that could work together.firstly, there's not much wrong with blaster damage. yes, it probably needs to be taken up a notch to compensate vs. laser range or ac falloff. i would even be willing to trade a tiny bit of range for that (not much though!). a slight increase to tracking also seems appropriate, to give them the distinct advantage at the ranges they are meant for. however, some of the numbers mentioned here are just way out there (50%?, 300%?, no way).what i'd really like is a ""hybrids 2.0"". given blasters short range, they are currently the only short range weapons that can't do meaningful damage outside of web range, and they are even not welcome in certain fleets where you are required to hit at ~20 by simply switching ammo (large guns). rails have to come in and fill the gap.given projectile's alpha strike and the range of beams (i realize that might be much thanks to the apocalypse though), how about making rails the medium range of the ""long range weapons"" with better tracking and dps than both projectiles and beams? i.e. beams become the long range weapon with the most range, but suffers from tracking, projectiles have alpha but shorter range and rails ends up in the middle with decent tracking and good dps.as is, the rokh for instance reach ridiculous distances with little effort, but do little damage. shorter-ranged rails with more dps would probably make it a very nice mid-to-long range sniper. to get the megathron to do the same, you would have to sacrifice damage mods for range mods to reach the same distance, balancing out the dps advantage of the megathron's bonus. the apocalypse would end up being the new rokh (if beam range is boosted overall) - ridiculous range, but little damage . i have no absolute idea on how to fix that. perhaps swap its range bonus for a damage or tracking bonus? this type of rails would also mean that a rail deimos would be a viable option for those that aren't comfortable with the up-close range of blasters.finally, how about re-doing short range t2 ammo entirely - even less range then they have today (void range perhaps half of that of am for instance?), far less damage (less than any other ammunition type?), but a massive tracking bonus. that would be across the board, not just for hybrid ammo.the goal would be for a ship, especially one with a tracking bonus, to be really dangerous to ships one class smaller than itself orbiting it (zealots orbiting a megathron at 500 for instance). even ships without tracking bonus would have a chance (afs orbiting a deimos at 500 for instance, if blasters in general are given a slight tracking boost). granted, this should not be a ""i win!"" button. ab afs would still be very difficult to hit, and this does not at all change anything with regards to signature radius.this idea was presented to me a while back, and it's been taking hold ever since (at least the first part, the ""goal"" stated is taking it further than its progenitor did i suppose).and finally, tanking... that's part of the price you pay for face-melt damage and what makes us blaster pilots. i love my deimos, even with the little tank it has. most pilots knows its damage potential. that's a good tank in itself. otherwise, range decides. either the deimos runs away or your opponent is in scrambler range. tank doesn't matter either way edit: fixed a mistake in the t2 ammo suggestion w/regards to damage."
1/20/2010,hoping to get some more attention to this - minor improvements are still improvements. =)
1/20/2010,"i've been saying from the start that the 5%k bonus is a poor bonus.you have just agreed with me and then told me i'm not telling the truth ?if the bonus is poor as we seems to agree upon at last then the ship will be negativelly affected.weaker bonus <> bonus is fine.at least i have logic, so far in this post you have condradicted yourself twice , once in the same sentence.do you understand what a percentage is ?if a ( low damage ) starts of with 100 damage and get 5% per level , at level 5 he has 125 damage.if b ( high damage ) starts of with 140 damage and gets 5% per level , at level 5 he has 175 damage.a low damage gets 25 extra damage , b high damage gets 35 extra damage.so b gets more extra damage than a , keeping them in balance between low and high damage.so no higher damage weapons dont need a higher percentage, they get more extra damage from the same percentage , because its a percentage no a fixed increase."
1/20/2010,"i take issue with that. ships are balanced on a ship-to-ship basis. bonuses are just one aspect of it.for example, here is an analogy of your argument of fail when applied to another aspect of a ship:do you agree that the myrmidon's 1175 powergrid is worse than 1500 powergrid of the harbinger? do you agree that myrmidon will be negatively effected by its powergrid being 1175 rather than 1500? weaker powergrid <> powergrid is fineboost myrmidon's powergrid to 1500!!! how can you guys not see this?! my argument is full of truth! myrmidon is far weaker than harbinger!!!11see the absurdity of your argument now?"
1/20/2010,i see the absurdity of your desperate counter argument.a myrms main weapons are its drones which consume 0 powergrid.compared to a harby who's main weapons are medium lasers which consume plenty of powergrid.to make an objective analysis you would need to work out what percentage of the grid required for a perfect t2 fit is available to each ship.
1/20/2010,"good! now you see the necessity to include other aspects of a ship in a ship balancing discussion, rather than just focusing on one (whether it be bonuses or powergrid)."
1/20/2010,"lets be very clear here so you dont try to misquote me.all aspects of a ship be that cpu/powergrid/cap/shield/armor/resists/harpoints whatever and bonuses are important to achiving ship balance.is it neccessary to analysis all that to point out a problem area ?noit has been shown and not disputed that a 5% kin only bonus is weaker than a rof|dpl bonus.because bonuses are applied to a ship for player skill trained, the performance of the ship in question alters as players skill up.a damage bonused cmb's performance increases by 1.6% per level of skill trained.a damage bonused gun boat's performance increase by 5% per level of skill trained.in simple terms hull training on cmb's returns less bangs for your bucks than hull training on gun/drone boats.the kin only bonus set at 5% per level means it is impossible for a cmb to be balanced at all player skill levels.let me expand on that, there are 2 extremes of possibility.a) at high skill levels cmb's are balanced v other boats.the implication here is that cmb's start from a higher base of performance all things considered, and that other boats catch up because they have a more powerful bonus.b) at high skill levels cmb's are underperforming v other boats.the implication here is that cmb's start from the same base performance all things considered, and fall behind in performance v other boats because they have a weaker bonus.so which is it? or is it somewhere in between the two."
1/20/2010,"counterexample:droneboats get 10% bonuses on their drones per level and they are still balanced versus gunboats with 5% bonuses on their guns.so, by your logic,""a) at high skill levels droneboats are balanced v other boats.the implication here is that droneboats start from a higher base of performance all things considered, and that other boats catch up because they have a more powerful bonus.b) at high skill levels droneboats are underperforming v other boats.the implication here is that droneboats start from the same base performance all things considered, and fall behind in performance v other boats because they have a weaker bonus.so which is it? or is it somewhere in between the two."""
1/20/2010,they are weak at high lvls thats for sure :)
1/20/2010,"erm i would answer the question straight away, but the above two statements are incorrent.drone boat bonuses are larger than other boats not smaller.the above statements were prepared where the first ship mentioned has the smaller bonus.but i understand what you are asking so.correcting those statements.a) at high skill levels droneboats are balanced v other boats.the implication here is that droneboats start from a lower base of performance all things considered, and that drone boats catch up because they have a more powerful bonus.b) at high skill levels droneboats are overperforming v other boats.the implication here is that droneboats start from the same base performance all things considered, and increase in performance v other boats because they have a better bonus.i would say to the corrected logic , looking at larger bonuses on dronesboats that.domi is towards a.myrm is towards a.vexor is b.ishtar is close to b.but having said that i dont begrudge other races there great ships.if you want to start a balance drone boats thread , please do it elsewhere."
1/20/2010,everybody knows that ships are balanced around max skills. balancing ships around skills-at-i and ignoring their balance at v would be utterly stupid.
1/20/2010,please prove your statement.this is a reasonable request as you have in the past require proof from me.proof or support this topic.
1/20/2010,would you support a blanket bonus change of changing them to +5% drone damage and hitpoints per level?
1/20/2010,i will neither support nor discourage a drone boat bonus change in this thread.to do so would widen the scope of the op to include drone boats and cmb's.the proper place for support or otherwise would be in a thread about drones boat bonuses.i would only give my support or otherwise after carefully reading the points made by the op of that thread and reading the arguments for and against.
1/20/2010,"please answer the question for the sake of the argument. it illustrates the very reason that i cannot support your suggestion. to re-iterate:hypothetically, if a person creates a thread calling for blanket drone bonus changes and this is the exact reason and analysis he provides:and he wants a single blanket change to the bonuses of all droneboats, such as moving 10% down to 5%. would you, hypothetically, support his suggestion?"
1/20/2010,"required, but not received, i should add. all the proof of ""balance-around-v"" that is needed is the obvious fact that it would be utterly stupid not to do this.""hi, i've got a great idea, we're gonna balance the game around skills-at-ii!""""so what happens when people train skills to iv or v?""""who cares?""since this thread is also utterly stupid, i won't be surprised to learn that you don't accept this..."
1/20/2010,"dav, you misread my post, probably because i didn't specify very clearly. i meant on a cmb the kinetic damage bonus is weaker than the rof bonus, not that it is a weaker bonus period(.) the bonus is weaker than a rof bonus, but that doesn't mean it's not balanced, that just means a rof or rainbow damage bonus could be overpowered.so we don't agree on the fact that the bonus is fine. i think it's fine. i think rainbow bonus to all of the ships are a more powerful bonus and would be a little too much.as for the little ****s who are trying to say drones are the primary source of dps for a ship, and that drones get unfair bonuses, consider this: max dps for a dominix with heavy drones is somewhere around the 500 dps mark. that's about half of the dps megas and hyperions get. so the primary and (as dav claims) the only important dps weapon system is severely low. drone boats are not balanced! myrmidon can only get like 300 dps from drones, while brutix and cane and others can get 600+ easily. drone boats are not balanced! drone boats can use turrets though and get utility highs though so it balances out. but don't argue that drone boats get an unfair bonus, because they start out with poor damage.caldari have weapon systems that compete with the others, they are not underpowered, this blatant boost to caldari would not fix caldari and is unnecessary and would make some ships too powerful. simply giving them a more powerful bonus would not fix caldari's problems"
1/20/2010,"you see what you have done james ?consider yourself reported for derailing attempt, this thread is for discussing kin bonus on cmb's.relax stil , no one here is proposing a nerf to drone boats.this is a thread about the kin bonus on cmb's only."
1/20/2010,"nice dodge. can't answer my question or something?i never implied there is anything wrong with drone boats. in fact, it wasn't even me who brought it up. i'm simply using that as an analogy of what you are doing and i'm using that to demonstrate how your argument is majorly flawed."
1/20/2010,"oh please, some guy a couple pages ago started trying to talk about tanking...you can't seriously think james was trying to derail the thread. consider yourself reported for trollingi know nobody is asking for a drone nerf. i'm just saying drones are very hard to compare to missiles, and drone bonuses should not be something to base missile bonuses on, other than the theoretical situations about blanket boosts/nerfs"
1/20/2010,then stop posting paragraphs justifying drones boats in this thread.your right drone bonuses should not be something to base missiles bonuses on.how we got here was a bit convoluted.i asserted that cmb balance against other ships changes as players skill up. true.doccia pointed out that the same issue affects drones boats which it does. true.we all agree that bonuses affect the overall performance of a boat.so why do we need to go charging off down drone boat nerfing thread lane ?to come back to the same point were at now ? we all agree that the difference in size of bonuses can negativelly or positivelly affect ship performance ?
1/20/2010,"no one is actually talking about droneboat balancing. i am using it to prove a point. just like the powergrid on myrmidon and harbinger example, i wasn't actually suggesting that the powergrid on myrmidon should be changed. i was using that to make a point.in either case, since this is not getting us anywhere, i'll cut to the chase.here is my point:quoting you directly:1) do you agree that different ships may fall in different categories? for example, the drake may be close to a while the caracal may be close to b.2) if so, do you agree that different changes should be applied to different ships, and not just a blanket change encompassing all of them?3a) if so, please change your op to reflect this.3b) if not, why not?"
1/20/2010,"ah i see, then why not just ask me that in the first place ?1) yes and yes to your example2) no3b) because the kinetic bonus affects more than just ship v ship balance.there are issues around the kin bonus that can not be solved by individual ship fixes on a ship by ship basis.namelly ( and these issues overlap somewhat )1) experianced players can do 0 more dps than noobs in cmb's ( 0 value for hull training ) in approx 2/3rds of encounters.2) averaged out the kin bonus is less valuable than a rof|dpl bonus2a) this means that caldari hull training performed by a caldari pilot is less valuable than the hull training done by pilots of other races.2b) caldari ships can never be balanced at all player skill levels against other races shipswhile this bonus is in use.3) the kinetic only bonus clashes with caldari combat tactics ( damage selecting ) cmb pilots are the only pilots who have to fight without any damage bonus.this is particularilly a problem if you are flying solo in a cmb.individual ship fixes would of course produce a better balanced end result in all ship fixes for a maxed skilled player versus other ships.what were talking about here.raising the dps bonus from 8% to 25% averaged.so on the question of ship balance its equiv to a 17% boost in dps at level 5.that sounds like a lot.but i'm pretty sure most of the cmb's could absorb that kind of increase without becoming op.exception to that rule are the drake and maybe the cerb.so if this fix goes through i think the majority of cmb's would be better balanced and the cerb might be a little op and the drake would definettely be ome way ahead of other bc.i dont think its unreasonable for any race to have great ships.let it be the drake for the caldari.in the same manner that the mini have the vaga,sabre,ruppy,broadsword.in the same manner that the gal have the taranis,ishkur,vexor,thantosin the same manner that the amarr have erm whatever they have geddon ? curse ? abso, that laser beasty dread who's name escapes me atm.i honestly cant put my finger on one caldari ship atm and say thats great.the drake is curently pretty good, but harby and cane seem there or thereabouts.but the drake is still a pants solomobile."

1/20/2010,"i can see your point, but your concerns do not hinder the proposal in principle but relate more toward the balancing of how hard/easy it should be to probe wrecks according to the different circumstances: wreck/can is in deadspace pocket wreck/can is in open space wreck/can is abandonedthese have to be balanced vs: difficulty to scan a mission ship in a deadspace difficulty to scan a mission ship in open spaceimho the difficulty from easy to hard to scan down should be: abandoned wreck in open space wreck/can in open space mission ship in open space mission ship in deadspace pocket abandoned wreck/can in mission deadspace pocket wreck/can in deadspace pocket this should insure that it will not become easier to scan down ships in mission sites/deadspace pockets."
1/20/2010,"supported. would turn salvaging more into a real profession, instead of the only option to be a ""salvager"" being to grief mission runners.abandoned ships being very easy to probe should provide a decent entry point for characters new to the profession/scanning."
1/20/2010,"wreck scanning supported, container scanning not* !*as long as it doesn't become too easy to scan them, eg. if a missionrunner disposes of his wrecks by shooting them or salvaging them himself quickly after killing the npc's he should not be probe-able."

1/20/2010,"i could support this if you suggested that wrecks could be probed using combat probes, but allowing them to be probed with core probes just presents too many problems.however, if you allow core probes to be used to find abandoned wrecks (wrecks that have been explicitly abandoned by the pilot who killed the rat), i could go for that too.however, this would make life very difficult for me. i make a habit of running missions in dangerous low-sec areas; often i have to leave the mission site to hide out while i'm being probed down -- if these guys could just probe my wrecks out, they'd do that and then wait for me to return. it would be the end of my low-sec missioning. i'd be very unhappy.i'd prefer only allowing abandoned wrecks to be probed and possibly automatically flagging wrecks as abandoned when a mission is completed."
1/20/2010,"i support this idea!running eve on my 2560x1600 dell monitor is terrible on my eyes. proportional fonts! yes! or .. larger fonts, at least! (twice as large?)"
1/20/2010,my name is bbb and i endorse this message
1/20/2010,"i can't imagine that this is as easy a change as it seems (yeah, i'm that guy). because there is so much crammed into the interface, making the font larger may blow it up.that said, it is an accessibility issue for players with worse vision, and the particular font that is being used is difficult to read even for people that can see it. it looks cool though."
1/20/2010,"one big problem with this as a reaction to storyline events is that gallente fw has re taken some systems and has held them for a bit.these may be lost next week, next month or next year.. then regained again etc... so are ccp going to change them every time the fw situation map changes?"
1/20/2010,they can't really expect people to run haul missions that leave high sec if the cargo is larger than the hold of a ceptor. period. that's just silly.
1/20/2010,+1also it would be nice if all celestial bodies were correctly-sized... i.e. filling the entire screen instead of being marginally larger than a space station...
1/20/2010,"as was stated in some other threads, i'd like to bring up the effects in eve as something that needs to be brought to ccp, these could all be kept at strictly client side, and henceforth have 0 impact to the servers.1. i would like to see an enhancement to the gun and projectile effects, as currently the effect really doesnt feel powerful at all, we're dealing with things up to 1400mm and yet the effect looks much less satisfying as it stands.2. explosions, it's time eve did explosions properly, i'm talking explosions based on the size of the ship, with fractured parts that could disappear after a few seconds but atleast a proper explosion with gases venting and you know a proper boom to the ship, with cloud and fire etc. i'm sorry but this has been long needed, eves explosions as they currently are leave a lot to be wanted, even if the floating parts blown apart arent included, a proper sized fireball and lingering smoke would be something. 2a. wrecks, why is it every ship wreck is just a weird mangle of metal strips, that the icon over the wreck pretty much covers? how about we get wreck types we already know the server tracks the size of the wreck so how about a better graphic to show when you know, a ship carcas or something.3. hull damage, oh my god this is probably one of my most hated things in all of eve, ever get to hull damage, and warp out to say that super gay single ripple of smoke from the back left corner of your ship!? well i propose a dynamic hull damage model, gases leaking from various parts of the ship at 5-15% damage, 15-30$ damage, gas leaks + fires and black smoke, and darkened overlay on top of the ship to show damage to the... well the hull, since its supposedly have taken a beaten, i dont see why the hull is sparkly clean with a small smoke stack from it if all the armor is gone and on top of that the hull is at 10% 4. finally last but not least on these revisions should be the return or addition of engine trails, you know nice little smoke trails from the engines during sub-warp travel, ab's and mwd's with their own trail types (ab bigger smoke, mwd maybe different color smoke), this doesnt have to be server side it could be all client side, to atleast add to the immersion.this is my first csm proposal, so i dont know if i did it right but after reading other threads from eve capsuleers like myself i figured i'd bring it to the csm's attention of how wanted these graphical changes are wanted. (ok, ok, the explosions and hull damage were my own annoyances that im adding to the proposal but i cant be the only one that wants to see them improved asap)"
1/20/2010,"100% for bringing back engine trails, and as long as it can be turned off at will, extra eye candy is nice too.- sok."
1/20/2010,"1. yes but start with hybrid turrets, projectiles at least have acs that look good. hybrid turrets you often dont even see firing.2. yes but dynamic, dont want to see it blowing up exactly the same everytime.rest just yes."
1/20/2010,"signed, especially for #4.ideally the list should also include a request for the return of the old cyno effect (or some modification thereof) and a general introduction of the long-promised particle effects for everything (engine plumes/trails, stargate effects, nos/neut, etc.)."
1/20/2010,"shield, missiles, and hybrid graphics (hmm... once again we see what ccp thinks about caldari). the hardener effects on armor tanks have this nice and very visible gold shimmer to it, while most of the time i can't even see my raven's shield hardeners unless i really zoom it and pay attention. missiles we all agree need something like what the ragnorak titan ddd has, nice smoke trails and everything, at the very least get rid of the bright light on cruise and torps and give then a really nice smoke trail effect, and make missile explosions seem a little better, maybe not so big and a little more detailed and hit parts other than just the center of the ship. also what the op said about not being able to see hybrids, this is so true, the neutron blaster effects were so much better before the change. when i saw the next blaster effects in the early builds i thought they weren;t finish but then they made it to the final product and i was very disappointed, lasers look better, projectiles look better.ccp gives use caldari pilots some love. 100% supportedwhile i'm on it return the cyno jump vortex effects and remove the eccm and sensor boosters, its very annoying, especially on bigger ships where they cover the entire screen of the fleet if you're even zoomed in at a moderate distance."
1/20/2010,"dropping the shiny missle effect for a nice thick smoke trail would be awesomeand your right hybrids do need a bit more love graphically than the ac's lolshield impacts should look awesome, but ya adding a shield effect would be nice, kinda like the armor ones but offset it from the ship itself so that its floating around the ship countored the same as the ships, that would look wicked. shouldn't be too hard, add a invisible layer around the ship using the same design as the hull, but transparent that the mask is applied to for the hardener animation, and for impacts pulse the area where the impact happens a radial impact to the shields transparency"

1/20/2010,"the market is only free within bounds set by ccp, to take the example of production ccp sets the number of production slots available at stations and poses and decides how long a job should take.in this manner the production capacity of eve is set by ccp and players can compete for a percentage of production capacity. this cap on production capacity is an artificial control that prevents major price crashes through over supply.what i'm trying to demonstrate here is the absurdity of stating that ""every other profession gets abandoned to the free market"". ccp have shown time and again that they will interfere with the market by altering blueprints or changing production methods such as invention or alchemy.to return to our mining friends i'm not saying that they deserve ""special protection and subsidy"", i'm saying they are in a situation where they can't compete with rat loot and that under such circumstances the mineral price floor isn't propping up miners, it's propping up a bad game mechanic.by reducing the isk fountain of rat loot you raise mineral prices, raise the price of ships and the whole problem of ships being cheaper than the insurance threshold goes away.alternatively you could ""reduce all insurance premiums and payouts by 25-33%"" and all we do is nerf miners pay by 25-33% and end up in exactly the same stupid insurance situation several months down the line.looking at how much miners earn for the effort they put in i'd have to ask why do you hate them so much you think their pay needs a nerf?"
1/20/2010,"the optimal price is one where grinders can afford to run multiple accounts but it's still worth it for pvpers to buy plexes rather than move to a game where they don't have to grind so much.i can't tell you what that optimal price is but i'd bet a wad of isk that someone at ccp has worked it out :)as stated earlier in the thread i'm not a fan of the current insurance mechanism and as such am not trying to ""make an argument for the current fixed insurance prices.""i'm making an argument that there's a game design imbalance where miners are undercut by ratters and that without fixing this the removal or reduction of the mineral price floor is a huge and unnecessary nerf to the mining industry.care to elaborate on these ""options available to substitute insurance in order to maintain this mineral price floor""? it would be nice to hear some fresh ideas on this subject.if the basket price doubles then with my suggestion the burger flipper is sitting pretty because he's the only one who can provide the minerals and as such is well paid.with malcanis's proposal the burger flipper is still being undercut by rat loot so the basket price will never double"
1/20/2010,"+1i've always thought that the insurance mechanic was poorly implemented, and it hasn't got better since i started playing. it needs some serious attention because as it stands now, it's a joke... hell i don't even bother insuring my t2 ships anymore. cal"
1/20/2010,"you do know i have consistently supported proposals to reduce or eliminate the mineral content of rat loot over the last 2 years? i even mention it in this thread specifically for that reason.but yes, anyway thanks for making it obvious that miners are quite aware that insurance is effectively an npc mineral buy order at levels far above what players are currently prepared to pay. go make yet another proposal to reform the mineral content of rat loot and i will support you... even though i make my isk ratting and missioning. i like the idea of replacing rat loot with meta bpcs that can either be used to build meta items or used directly by inventors to increase their invention chances (such that even meta-1 pieces have value)i think it would also be a great idea to increase by 10-20% the amount of zydrine and megacyte required to build ships.just to make this explicit - i do not want to see miners nerfed. i have long thought that the profession needed some devlove. but as part of that love, i want to see mining changed from an npc-supported profession to a player supported profession. which is also consistent with the other arguments i have made over the years.""care to elaborate on these ""options available to substitute insurance in order to maintain this mineral price floor""? it would be nice to hear some fresh ideas on this subject.""eg: change pos and/or pos modules in to player-created items. that will soak up a fantastic amount of minerals."

1/20/2010,"i keep seeing proposals to improve eve visuals. i really think that there are more important things to worry about than aesthetics.that said, i do like your ideas.-the munitions pathing wouldn't be too hard in terms of randomizing a visual for where ammo lands. i think the more difficult part would be tying that into the combat system to correctly render missed hits as misses, and randomize a munition path for hits.one of the things working against this is that this is an rpg, not a space combat sim. not saying you can't translate combat graphics appropriately (we've all seen any number of games doing it) but try to think in that context when approaching entity to entity combat. -removing self-effects would be a nice feature and i think would go a long way for newer players, or those with poorer eyesight who can't see the overview icons, to recognize where an attack was coming from.-the missile hardpoint thing - that's been batted around here for a long time. i agree with you, but good luck.-warp scrambling effects are fine as is.-mwd and afterburner animations: if your target is pushing more than 3k, it's probably not an afterburner ;)i'll support this ticket in the context of you've got some good ideas, but i'm more 'function over form' and performing graphics upgrades is low priority when there are other major features that need fixing first (other than keeping your graphics team busy)."

1/20/2010,"in my opinion, not only code needs being looked into, but game mechanics have to change: technology will always pose a limit while the current mechanics give the players the opportunity and the motivation to put as many ships as possible on the same objective, and lag is inevitable soon or later.here is my analysis and subsequent proposal."
1/20/2010,"ccp tried to get people onto the test server to identify the problem:hunting the lag monsterboth tests were scheduled for pretty bad times (1700 gmt during the workweek?) but hopefully they found the cause of the lag. there is feedback in this thread about the event.point is, ccp seems to be aware of the problem and working on a solution.this:makes me think they need to come up with a different method for testing.this:was an amusing read - and well deserved criticism.finally, this:leaves me thinking they might actually identify the problem.sokratesz, i really don't think you needed to post this thread though, you should already be able to contact ccp about this as you are a member of the csm. half the csm has likely been in one of these lagged out fleets - considering the alliances they are in - so get with them and go find out what's going on."
1/20/2010,"supported, including a drop in refinery loss/reduction in refinery cpu.however, it might also be an idea to think about a faction ore compression pos module that essentially duplicates the rorqual's ore compression abilities. to balance this this module would have to have a fairly hefty cpu/grid use and only provide 1-2 slots. such a compression module is aimed squarely at wh miners but might also find use in 0.0 and even empire, reducing transport overhead."
1/20/2010,"well... i'd say that ore created the rorqual so they wouldn't have to build a pos... although i believe that rorquals would be more efficient in deep space assignments than this tower, however this pos isn't a bad idea."
1/20/2010,"if you're referring to what i think you are, thank your allies (-a-), they love to shrink grids. normal grids aren't that bad."
1/20/2010,"the same way a server knows it needs to resend a packet when the packet is ""lost"" - the clients send countless confirmations back to the server already for everything the server sends them.elegant solutions:1. don't spawn the ship into the new grid until the client confirms it has loaded.2. use the ""jump cloak"" feature when entering a grid that is heavily loaded (have the timer equal to expected load time).i'm fairly confident that part of the issue comes from the logs in the new fleet thing. perhaps it would be wise to not send notifications for client logs until the client has loaded the grid? i've been watching this in fleets recently. that lovely rubberbanding effect seems to happen about the same time as everyone and their sister is broadcasting (warp/align to and need reps often start flooding all at the same time as everyone is trying to load the grid). impatient people that we are, when people in fleet don't see everyone warp right away some have been known to spam the ""warp to"" button. similarly, when people are dying and not being instantly repped, they have been known to spam the ""need reps"" button. perhaps putting a short timer on those buttons would help (for everyone else's sanity at least)?i know a goon didn't just complain about another alliance playing grid mechanics games. i vividly remember being in a fleet where the goon fc told everyone to jet single units of ammo as much as possible just before an enemy fleet jumped in to attack a station. none of the alliances really should point fingers when it comes to grid games."

1/20/2010,"some of your proposals are still not fully defined and explained. obviously it's not as simple as you think it is or you would have explained it properly. i'll try to explain what information you still need to provide.1) you have not explained (or at least written it into the final proposal) how scan probes and multi-room missions interact. what happens if i scan down a mission runner in room 3 of a mission and press warp. where do i end up? entry gate (current), room 2 (last cleared room), room 3 (where he is) or room 3 on top of him.2) you still have not explained if or how this enables a friendly fleet member to warp in to salvage behind you. (it's been asked before, too). if warp to fleet drops him on your head, he can't find room 1. you have to warp him back. no time saving. if warp to fleet drops you on room 1 (like it does now) this feature does nothing.3) this will have no time increase for competent mission runners who don't warp out of missions (angel extravaganza level 4 with bonus room takes less than 37 minutes). at least admit that it's a boost to beginner runners only.4) so granted that it's no benefit to higher end runners, and allows for griefers to warp into missions more easily, and the fact that most missioners die when they engage ninjas (ninja plural, they always have hidden friends), how is this not a boost to the griefing of less competent mission runners?i'm not saying that's bad, but you've completely ignored the cons as in pretended they don't exist.if anything a better idea would be to reduce gate distances. ccp has already done this one some missions. i think one of the serpentis level 4 used to have a 90 km ride, but it's shorter now.another proposal that needs further clarification rather than your random personal attacks.""alternative to bookmarks"" makes no sense. so you are proposing instead of warping to bm, you are going to mwd millions of kilometers to the next room? what distance are you proposing the rooms are moved to? weren't you trying to avoid the long travel times in the first place?you admit since rooms are not locked by gates, how to do you stop people bypassing rooms? it's more than that though. it's griefers beating the mission runner to the objective and denying it. this is jeremy tacs all over again. i've mentioned him before. you should find out what his mission is all about.i'm also pretty sure it boosts pvp fits and we all know how bad at pvp mission runners are.ok but ccp knows. you don't really *need* to propose this. they know their game needs better graphics and they do update them a little each patch."
1/20/2010,"well - while it's already bumped.dunning-kruger effect seems to be applicable here. thanks zedrick for showing me this video.what i can't figure out though - you've already been exposed as a troll, but people keep feeding you. at this point it's just their fault."
1/20/2010,"and when were you appointed or elected to speak for all mission runners? i personally do not want my bounties/loot to be lowered. it's called an afterburner, try it sometime.not to mention you can use ships like marauders or an orca with uber tractor beam ranges to get those pesky wrecks."
1/20/2010,"ok. let's pretend that all proposals in this forum are thorough and detailed as you pretend they be, even if i already covered the questions you're asking here.1- scanning is unchanged. whoever scans finds the first room. of course if they gate into an unlocked room, they'd be able to warp in there, if they bookmark, warp out, and warp back in to bookmark.2- fleet dynamics remain unchanged. whoever gates into mission space for the first time will have to run through the gates.3- there will be no mission time increase of any kind, and in no situation. it's in fact all the contrary, everybody would be able to benefit from mission bookmarks if they'd so desire. of course if you don't have a reason to bookmark and warp out, this addition doesn't benefit you.4- these assumptions are plain wrong. it's simply idiotic to even think that you or anybody else canalwaysaccept a missionrun itfinish itwithout interruption.oh well, you (as in anybody) might be one of those basement gremlins that doesn't have a social life, but otherwise people for example have friends, relatives, bathroom needs, and similar, and at some point you will leave a mission (if you mainly pve, of course), and will surely be grateful that you don't have to pass every single gate back in, when you can bookmark your cleared rooms.it's all of the contrary in fact, unexperienced mission runners will know that it's ok to warp out quickly, since they will have the option to return to mission when they have refitted or better prepared (for example losing mob aggro), much quicker than before.indeed, there are no contrary points. all of them exist already, and for every disadvantage, theres an outweighting benefit.5- does make sense instead. if bookmarks aren't allowed, at least allow people to travel to the next gate using an mwd (afterburners are ""a-ok"", but a battlecruiser still takes ages to cover 30 kilometers.)6- rooms are still locked by gates. the only advantage is that if you clear the room, you can bookmark and warp in later.regarding pvp, carebears would have a better card to play, since it'd take a just a pretty quick refit (you could run missions with scramblers/ core stabilizers, etc., in your cargo) to get back in mission space to face your griefers.pvp gets a boost, and carebears have a better chance to defend their missions.those are simply good, and deserve approval. i sure know that i like better fight graphics rather than better planet graphics, for example.ps my witty, and possibly annoying, comments are just a response to imbecility."

1/21/2010,"there's a difference between 'weaker', 'poor' and 'inadequate'; i think everyone agrees that the 5% kinetic damage bonus is weaker -- but most of us believe that it is neither poor nor inadequate.compare a 10% damage bonus with a 5% damage bonus; sure, the 5% damage bonus is weaker, but that doesn't make it poor or inadequate.the 'poor' or 'inadequate' label can only be applied when taking all other ship attributes into account and comparing the sum of those to the sum of the attributes of all other ships; this you flatly refuse to allow into the discussion.your premise is that the bonus is inadequate, not that it is weaker. unfortunately, you use these two ideas equivalently. the change you suggest does not follow from the bonus simply being weaker. time and time again people are disagreeing with your premise yet still agreeing that the bonus is weaker and you take them to be hypocrites. if you change munitions, you're choosing not to use your bonus, you're not losing it."
1/21/2010,if a bonus was a fixed value i would agree with your statement.computation of some sort ( whether sumation or multiplication or whatever ) would be required to properly evaluate there value in isolation from other ship attributes.whats clear about nearly all bonuses is the fact that they are granted as percentages.the great thing about percentages is they take into account the base performance.eg a blaster boat doing 500dps at hull 0 does 625dps at hull 5 a laser boat doing 400 dps at hull 0 does 500dps at hull 5so a blaster boat does ( 500 / 400 ) = 1.25 ( 25% ) more damage than a laser boat at skill 0a blaster boat does ( 625 / 500 ) = 1.25 ( 25% ) more damage than a laser boat at skill 5.it is not neccessary to look at all the base attributes of both the laser boat and the blaster boat to evaluate the effectivness of the bonus.so no i dont agree with your statement that all aspect of everything needs to be researched to reach the conclusion that a weeker bonus is a poorer bonus.because both are expressed as a percentage they can both be evalutated in isolation from ship stats.both the kin bonus on cmb's and rof|dpl on others are percentages.e.g. they boost there respective ships based on the ship base performance as in the example.so in this case a weeker bonus is a poor bonus.
1/21/2010,"the thing is... the drake is already a good ship. currently, everyone and their mother seems to have a drake and it is probably, percentage-wise, the most popular ship in eve. it does not require a buff, period. in order for me to support your suggestion, you must address this problem. like i said a couple pages back, i have no problem with you buffing most of the ships you listed, but there are some that i have issue with.---oh and, sorry, but i must point out the flaws in your argument:true. but consider this:megathron has 5% damage per level.armageddon has 5% rof per level.for example, the armageddon does:- 500 dps at hull 0. - 526.3 dps at hull 1. (5.3% dps increase from the previous level)- 555.6 dps at hull 2. (5.6% dps increase from the previous level)- 588.2 dps at hull 3. (5.9% dps increase from the previous level)- 625 dps at hull 4. (6.25% dps increase from the previous level)- 666.7 dps at hull 5. (6.67% dps increase from the previous level)the megathron does:- 600 dps at hull 0. (20% more dps than geddon)- 630 dps at hull 1. (19.7% more dps than geddon)- 660 dps at hull 2. (18.8% more dps than geddon)- 690 dps at hull 3. (17.3% more dps than geddon)- 720 dps at hull 4. (15.2% more dps than geddon) - 750 dps at hull 5. (12.5% more dps than geddon)this discrepancy exists for all ships with rof and damage bonuses. now, you said:okay, let's see how you prove rof and dpl ships are balanced without evoking any of their other attributes. please try, i'll welcome it.if you can't, then do you concede that; if we follow your argument, then we must rebalance every single ship with discrepancies in the percentage of their bonuses?"
1/21/2010,"you know something dude, you are quite right.rof and dpl are not equal bonuses.i have always known that rof was not exactly the same as dpl.if you go back and read some of my earlier post i state the kin bonus in terms of dpl and acknoledge the small difference in rof>dpl by using the approx symbol ~.dude i had no idea rof was so much more powerful than dpl.drone bonuses 50% more dps at level 5rof bonused weapons 33% more dps at level 5dpl bonused weapons 25% more dps at level 5kinetic only bonus 8% more dps at level 5i really do need to go and review and correct the op.update it for dominion pirate vessels no longer gettin the kin bonus as well while i'm there.thanks dude for bringing this travesty to my attention."

1/21/2010,"i dont see how this would be useful except to gallente rp fanatic corps who only fly gal boat.most fleets i see are pretty mixed.your right that the info links are poorest of the 4 types and therefore the eos is a useless command.but i think a better replacement would be a damage links.ie links that increase the dps of all weapons systems.so all ships in mixed fleets can benefit.and the eos is no longer a useless piece of crud.make the damage links, bonus them to the eos/astarte so that the gal spec warfare becomes damage rather than info.keep the info links, just not bonused on any command."
1/21/2010,"that might work better. if you want four turret links, the bonuses you want are likely cap use for amarr, optimal for caldari, tracking for gallente, and falloff for minmatar(though those last two can be switched). fits racially, covers all the non-dps stats, and they should all be fairly balanced(though the optimal range one will probably have to have a lower number on it than the others). i'm not opposed to more gang-boosting equipment. i think some of it could be pretty cool, as long as you're careful to ensure that you don't wind up with a ship in a fleet being three times as effective as one not, and that all of them are usable at least in some narrow circumstances. i think you might be able to do better with a new class of ships for the role(""flagship"" t2 bses, or just more command ships), but that's not a moral stance, just my intuition. i just don't think that it pays for us to get too ambitious and ask for things that ccp can't possibly deliver."
1/21/2010,"i wish they would introduce a new ship that was a bit bigger than a bs and could run say the 3 current links, +1 of the new proposed combat oriented link and had the passive bonus of what the titan gives gangs. sure make it cost like 3-5 hundred mill or whatever making it only worth taking out in big fleets, but also don't allow it to be a pwn mobile. maybe make it only good vs. light support to maybe medium. also throw in a large cargo bay to carry loot/cap 800s!"
1/21/2010,csm has recently passed a proposal to look at info warfare links (and boost the eos as a separate issue). i don't like all of this particular proposal for reasons other people have posted but perhaps one of the three info links could give a drone control or hp bonus (control range would fit with them being information links. you could make a case for the shield and armour resistance links to apply to drones ). i still think sensor integrity is something useful for a gang but not sure which of the other two should go to give a drone bonus instead.

1/21/2010,"public missions as stated are posted up on a central board at agent stations in certain systems. anyone can come along and help on these missions. these are basically cooperative in highsec where everyone signing up will be on the same side, for example gallente pod pilots attacking a caldari fleet in luminaire. everyone can just turn up an lend a hand in the mission and gets a share of the reward lp and isk and standing at the end as long as they have the mission. this could be handled as a rarer event or have multiple different public missions going on in a system at once to make it a more regular occurrence.in lowsec and fw areas people can sign up to fw / lawkeeping public missions on different teams depending on where they sign up or what militia they belong too. these missions can serve as great set pieces for both conflicts with wannabe cops facing off against pirate players over a drugs cache, or gallente players defending an npc supercarrier against caldari oncomers.these mechanics have been proven to work in other mmos are are great fun, why not in eve? they are a great way to get average joes to interact with other players on many levels."

1/22/2010,"i have to agree with magnus here. as much as i love my drones having a domi pilot on a second account, i see too much automation capable by the op's ideas. the mining idea presented screams 'legalized mining botters' to me.i would like to see the drone window improved to relay better information (such as drone damage while in bay), and key commands for drone-related functions like launching, but i can't support this.not supported."

1/22/2010,"that is actually a possible easy downgrade of my proposal but i think that in the end it poses anyway more load on the node of interest, while my proposal gives more spreading, that we actually need to fix engagements with 1350+ players that now actually occur.i think that with my proposal we could actually fix lag for combat of all the sizes we see in 0.0 today and in the next future, while your downgraded version is not giong (in my opnion) to solve the problem once for all.btw your porposal is much faster to implement, and that's what makes it interesting."
1/22/2010,"well said!i don't suggest the sov itself to be based on constellation, but the sov contesting mechanic. if you want to contest the sov, you have to conquest the entire ""group of systems"", and when the enemy lost you can share this group of stars with you friends just putting there your tcus.uhm. my idea is to simply replicate the fight in one system in many copies. so if the current system is balanced, my proposal should be balanced too. if you say that bridges and cynojammer give too many advantages to defenders in these situation, i would suggest 2 solutions: if a system is contested the defender must chose what to keep online: either the cynojammer or the jumpbridge.reduce the hitpoints of cynojammers and jumpbridges so that they become easier to disable. the cynojammer+jumpbridge has proven itself very strong in history, maybe overpowered. in my proposal (where mobility is critical) this combination would become even more powerful, as you pointed out. so suggest to look at it.i have a system in my mind that is quite complicated.some points about it:all structures all around the constellation will come out of reinforcement mode at the same time and enter it at the same time.combat ends and the whole constellation enter reinforcement when in all system a point is reached when the present mechanic reinforces the system. anyway this will not allow the attacker to destroy an ihub or conquer a station in the first round: when the ihub or station are damaged to the amount that now causes them to enter reinforced mode, they become invulnerable but repairable if the constellation is not in reinforced mode. if some of the necessary sbus are lost in combat, attacker has 12 hours from the destruction time to anchor and put online some otherseen how may people are there in a fight today i would suggest to use as ""conquest unit"" a group of not less than 3 systems. if i am right, the least constellations have 5 systems. so i suggest to split constellation into some group made of 3 to 5 stars over which the proposed mechanic could be applied.if we want fights with more strategical dept where intelligence of strategists really count, the bigger the space is, the better. i think there will be a sort of high command that issues order to fleet field commanders in different solarsystems."
1/22/2010,great idea!
1/22/2010,"i don't think so much that sov should be decided by multiple targets across a constellation, as sov is suppose to be about taking a system, owning a constellation just shows the capabilities of an alliance. i think, however, that the current sov mechanic should be tweaked that attacking multiple systems at the same times offers a greater chance of success over blobing a single system. the way i see it is that sov is designed around attacking undefended structures with an extremely large amount of ehp, therefore to maximize success an fc will try to get as much dps as possible to a single target, because attempting to split their forces say across two or three systems would put them at a disadvantage because of the type cost and risk. here's how i see it:the attacker has to online the sbus and reinforce the outposts and tsus, they need to consider how much dps they need to defend the sbus, reinforce the outposts and tsus, and defend against the defender's fleet.the defender has to consider how much dps is needed to successfully take on the sbus the attacking fleets defending them.right now because it takes so much time to online an sbu and the structures have a lot of hp and the alliance only as but so many ships they can commit to a fight, the risk of attempting to attack several systems at the same time is too high, as the defender alliance may also have the same total number of ships they can commit but will have enough time to take on the attacking fleets who have decided to split their fleets before even a single system is put into reinforce or captured. therefore, the attacker will consolidate all their forces into one location, which will mean the defender will have to, which means epic blob. what needs to be done is the cost and defensive capabilities of the sov structures need to be recalculated so that it becomes more favorable for an attacking alliance to split there forces across possibly three or more systems so that unless the defender really wants to defend a particular system they will split up their forces because attempting to take on the all the systems one by one will mean that they will not have enough time to save all of their systems."
1/22/2010,"defenders are having it pretty rough of late. just look at the current wars going on. i am beginning to think that the node lag is actually working to the significant favor of the attackers. specifically because defense fleets are formed after an attacking fleet is already in the target system, more often than not. the only time when this is reversed is when a defender has ample time to form a defense fleet before the attacker arrives (primarily when they have a spy in place to identify when and where an attacker is going). really, defenders do need a bone thrown their way. i mean, we're in the game to enjoy the battles, not to plant a continuous stream of sov structures."
1/22/2010,"we agree on the last part of your statement. but tell me how you can untie those two aspect, the need for the attacker to fight on many system to conquer only one.i think we agree that with current mechanic neither the defender nor the attacker have to think about such things. for reasons stated here such reasoning will never happen with any ""non invasive change"" unless we split fights on may solar systems. spreading forces on may solarsystem makes mobility an issue and oblige our strategist to think more deeply on what they are doing. at start, the attacker will have the bonus of the first move if he plays smart, and he has to bring to the party at very consistent force if he wish to win (greater or equal to the defender). it has always worked this way and always will. if he has to online sbus, keep them online or retry to online them again in many solarsystem he must split his forces because he must be ready to fight whenever the defender decides to attack sbus or to repair outpost or ihub.right now the penalty for the attacker in case the defender succeed in destroying/offlining enough sbus is too harsh.if the attacker is not forced to split his forces, he simply won't do it, even if the hp of sov related structures are reduced, because the benefits of focus fire are too sharp.ps. i'm not an english native speaker so my opinion is not worth so much, but can you reduce the lenght of your sentences? it would make them easier and faster to understand."

1/22/2010,oh of course i haven't made isk off dying - a t2-fit bs with trimarks has about 50-60 mill of unrecoverable loss on it. but i've made money from insurance; paying 19m to get 60m back.
1/22/2010,"tldr; all 6 pagessupport the op, at least a quick-fix is neededmy idea for a permanent solution:1. remove insurance in concord deaths, suicide ganking is just silly now days2. the insurance is calculated from the price of minerals needed to build a ship, but those prices are fixed to a value ccp set many years ago-so how about ccp update those mineral values to actual average mineral values... maybe quarterly.-maybe set the insurance value of the ship to the average price of the ship (that would make t2/t3 insurable - and i haven't given that much thought)as for suicide ganking... my corpmate was ganked by a geddon with t1 fit, i think that guy made money from dying and from the loot drop... he didnt eaven try to scan the industrial to see if it was worthwile... because if the indy is empty and drops a single t2 cargo expander... it's money in the pocket, that's just silly! where's the risk reward ratio of suicide ganking if you make money from dying and everything else is just a bonus"
1/22/2010,"this is essentially the tl;dr of the thread, except that we were thinking of something more like a 7-day rolling average sale price. no need to remove concord payouts, just set the insurance at 85-90% of insurance value and the problem pretty much takes care of itself."

1/22/2010,"dominion 1.1 brought a whole bunch of awesome stuff.but also one particular thing, that affected alot of people, but according to ccp: from this thread.small number of players?where do you get those stats from? secret in-game system logging?also, i do believe complexity and time is better than ""we just make it easier on ourself"", simply because the more people who get more options between crappy graphics, good graphics and fps, will be happier people.in fast, i propose we should have more graphic options.low/high settings just doesn't cut it for a modern game, it was mid-90's we only had the option to choose between high and low graphics, it doesn't belong in 2010."
1/22/2010,"uh, dude, i'm willing to bet that the numbers are that low. for me, i was either running high or low. (dual-boxing) this affects 0.0% of my current eve time. medium shader was pretty bad in all honesty anyway. it was either too consuming (cpu/gpu wise) or it wasn't enough. i'd rather they cut down on their current workload than add to it. i give kudos to this. it means more in-game stuff and less fluff that barely no one uses. ""also, i do believe complexity and time is better than ""we just make it easier on yourself"" - wrong. if their people who work on the shading have to do less work on a single item, then it means more items faster."
1/22/2010,"based on the number of whines about this i would say ccps numbers are pretty much spot on. the people who have been affected are angry naturally, but there doesn't seem to be any real outcry about the thing. i'm against adding more graphics options like this, since it causes so much work and people don't seem to use them. i would prefer that more new things are actually done on the graphics front and less time spend on maintenance work. having just two options isn't exactly great though, but continual development means you actually have to maintain those options, so such extra features should be vulnerable to removal because of lack of users. this has happened to many other features too for the same reason during my time here, so i don't think there is anything special about this decision."
1/22/2010,"it's 1 thread with.. what, 10 replies?the eve playerbase is, afaik, over 200,000.if cutting medium graphics means that ccp can use more time neglecting miners and working on other things, that's fine with me."

1/22/2010,you can read all about it here:the chains of the supercap
1/22/2010,"i agree. supercap pilots (not that i am one) should be able to leave those ships without fearing them being stolen.i would propose letting them be anchorable inside a pos shield, and only password protectable when anchored.iow, you can set the password, but it only prompts you for one when it's anchored.maybe give pos's a new module supercap mooring facility. so within 3k m of that (or whatever) you can anchor the supercap.however, in general i support the idea of letting people play the game their way."
1/22/2010,"methods exist for even solo players to protect their supercaps. while i see where the op is coming from, it is dumbing the game down and making it easier for people who should know better anyway."
1/22/2010,this.... supported
1/22/2010,"so far every method save the safespot one (which i've been advised is too risky to really use - don't know if that's good advice i mean to test it) requires the use of alts in some way.since ccp states that alts should not be required to play the game, a fix is, in my opinion, needed.that could be anchoring. that could be more pos options (one that you could set up with greater restrictions - such as only the anchorer could enter or some such) or it could be something like a mooring facility, password or something else entirely.right now though the 'standard' is that you get an alt who can barely fly the thing and then log off with the alt flying it and only log him in when you want to use it.given that is the standard and very few folks seem to do anything else, it would seem to me that more options are needed.mind you - maybe other people do other things that don't need alts and i just don't know about them. if so, by all means please share."
1/22/2010,"actually that's a bad idea. no alliance would think twice about throwing their entire cap fleet at a pos, camping it 24/7 for the few days it takes to come out of reinforce, then melting both the pos and the anchored titan.this idea would simply become a way for titans to be used as bait to lure out an enemy cap fleet.negative. how do you make money if you have only one character and a supercap? you don't. leaving such a ship without a pilot in it, even in a super deep safespot, has far more risk than any possible reward from current money making methods in the game. you have to have an alt to sit in it. or simply use an alt as the pilot (which is what most people do).this is what it all boils down to. if alts aren't required... if ccp doesn't want shared accounts... if ccp doesn't want rl money to be a component of getting such a ship (simply put, you have to have an alt that does nothing but fly the supercap every once in a while when it is needed)... give them a way to hide while your character does something else that doesn't require an alt."
1/22/2010,"i suggest you detail the proposal in here instead of just linking to a post in another forum.that out of the way, nobody is forcing you to get into a supercap in the first place. if you have 15-90 billion to drop on a supercap then it isn't a stretch to suggest you buy a second account with isk to park it on. you can even buy a ready made alt to avoid the training time.all ships have pros and cons, one of the cons of a supercap is that they cannot dock in stations and thus either have to be left vulnerable at a pos or have a pilot in it at all times.supercaps are not supposed to be available to everyone and that is reflected in the level of commitment required when getting in to one.but you can play the game without an alt.however nowhere does it say you can do everything in game without other people/alts to support you."
1/22/2010,"yes, but all the pros and cons are in game. this is the only one that stretches outside of the game environment.honestly, this is pretty low priority in my opinion, but there is a clear inconsistency here that the op is pointing out."
1/22/2010,"no. dumbing the game down is not inherently a bad thing. in this case, eliminating unnecessary and unconventional hoops that supercap pilots have to jump through is beneficial to the game.edit: supported."
1/22/2010,"well to be honest, it is a huge sacrifice, i would like to see supercap security heightened, perhaps a non sov requiring supercap docking facility for poses would be in order. i have already trained a garage alt for mine, which took about 5 months. it is aggravating that these ships are so vulnerable. but it's the price you pay for the awesomesauce i suppose."
1/22/2010,"the major con in this case is being stuck inside it - there isn't any out of game penalty at all! you are free to fly one or fly something else. all you can't do is be half baked about it and decide to fly it one day and not the next without somewhere to park it be it a pos, supercap array, corpmate or a garage alt.you decide to fly a supercap, that is part of the price you pay there is no inconsistency at all. you know what you are getting yourself into.these are supposed to be expensive end game ships for use by big alliances. they are not shiny toys for anyone who wants to fly one casually. there is nothing to stop you if you have the isk and the skills trained, but you have to accept the issues that go with them.i mean you can't even move system without assistance, do you think that is unfair too?risk vs reward. 8,000 - 10,000 dps ships have drawbacks, deal with them"
1/22/2010,"i wrote it there first and it seemed redundant to post exactly the same thing again when a link would suffice. no one is forcing me to fly ships either. or play the game. flying a supercapital is the natural end-game of the combat pilot. no, not all will want to go there, to be certain - that's personal preference - but most combat pilots dream of the day that they can helm a titan.most will quit the game long before and, of course, not all toons are combat pilots. yes, i could do the 'easy' thing and train an alt to make my nyx or erebus magically disappear anytime i don't want it - but that doesn't seem to be in the spirit of the game to me. the point of these ships being unable to dock is that they must be kept someplace. they are artifacts in space. mobile stations.but that's not how the game is played. right now, that's just not an option, so players take advantage to make them magically disappear.<shrug> i do not see this as a good thing - or in the spirit of the sandbox of eve.i could, indeed, do those things easily. i could even go and dump real cash on a whack of pilot licence extensions to buy both the garage alt and the ship. i wouldn't even need another account. i could do all those things, oh tomorrow if i wanted to. i could afford the real money - that isn't the point.none of that is playing the game. sure, it's allowed, but it's not playing the game. it's metagaming and i don't happen to like, or support, metagaming.your mileage may vary of course.meaning, if you aren't willing to metagame, then you can't have one. can't say as i agree with that, but that is, of course, just my opinion.you mean dropping a couple of hundred bucks off my credit card to ccp? that's all it would take. they are available to anyone - all it takes is cash and some minimal understanding of the market. you don't even need to spend the time, just buy a toon on the market.instead i spent years playing the game to become a cap pilot. my wife spent months mining to get the ore to build my thanatos. that's playing the game. at least from where i sit. doing it the other way isn't quite cheating, but it's buying victory and i do not think of that as a good thing.i love the idea of other people being able to help - but that isn't an option here.and it does say that you can 'do everything without an alt' actually. ccp has it in a couple of places. not exactly those words - but i believe the quote is something like 'you should never be required to have a second account to do anything in the game.' well, piloting a supercarrier is something in the game - as i understand it, that should apply."
1/22/2010,"if you own a supercap it's generally a given that you don't have to worry about money... if you absolutely must restrict yourself to one vessel i've heard you can rake in 150mil/hour running anomolies in milfs. as for titans, i'm sure you could hire out your bridging services etc etc.tl:dr you are not being forced into an undockable behemoth of awesome, if you want one of these vessels you have to accept the consequences. it is possible to operate without an alt in them, just don't expect to be doing much else. don't expect to be able to have your cake and eat it.ps i would much sooner leave a supercap unattended at a 1000au safespot while i went and ran some level 4s or something than log out in it for more than 48 hours at a friendly tower."
1/22/2010,"actually it is perfectly possible (and simple and easy and, in fact, fairly cheap) to have your cake and eat it too.you just need to have an alt.if you don't have one - it is functionally impossible to ever do anything else as long as you own that ship.apparently this doesn't seem wrong to some folks.<shrug> it seems entirely messed up to me. i could join the alt club super easy and all my issues go away, but if i want to keep everything in game, nope.this doesn't seem broken to you?"

1/22/2010,"just my 2 cents...i'd kinda like to see an entire rework of the visual stuff.basically, people complain now and then about warping through planets, stations, etc.and then this talk of warping/jumping into a grid, and dying before you even saw what was there.so i'd like to see travel more akin to star trek or babylon 5. either your ship aligns to warp, and then disappears or enters a conduit. then you travel through whatever'ness until you arrive. but before then, the ""camera drones"" we see the world through, warp ahead faster. they arrive on scene, and start loading the grid. when everything is loaded, then we arrive... either out of the conduit or just flying up like we do now.how do we know when it's loaded, you ask? i'd say we use the same gate cloak timer stuff. if you warp to a location, and do nothing, then you will ""arrive"" in 30 seconds. if you are loaded, and attempt any action, then you will ""arrive"" at that point.now i realize this could easily lead to a lot more ambushes. having an entire fleet suddenly spawn and open fire would be... unpleasant. but the usual rules for targeting time would still apply. so incoming ships would not have an advantage of already locking before they've ""arrived"". while ships in site will now be able to target a ship as soon as it ""arrives"", rather than waiting for the warp invulnerability to wear off.i'm sure there's kinks to iron out, but that's the gist of it."
1/22/2010,"as opposed to half the fleet appearing to the enemy, but being unable to do anything? seems like very little difference to me."
1/22/2010,"optimally fix the grid load problem, and grid crashing, but at minimum give the attacker a chance to act, so yes i agree with proposal"
1/22/2010,"i dont like this idea, yet.to explain, there are times that the grid does load, and pilots can see that there is a gate camp. so they use a second login, to boot their still cloaked ship off the grid, while still cloaked.then, their ship warps off. while it is still logging in on the new login, they do it again. this resets the point where they will reshow up on the grid, ussually 10,000's if not 100,000's of km from where they exploited this.until the developers fix this exploit, i would say no to this. as, if you jump, and then on your voice coms, such as outside services such as mumble, vent or teamspeak, get the ""holy crap"" signal, pilots could then use the exploit mentioned above. we recommend that any time a pilot is logging out, that you continually return to that same point on the origional grid. and that that point not be changed for 180 seconds from inital logout, or until your ship is actually back on the on a grid where they first initially logged out."
1/22/2010,"30 seconds is hilariously inadequate for this issue. i have been in fleets where we jump a system (no one else is in the system - no enemy fleet - nothing), then cook dinner, eat dinner, and still have time before the grid loads. you may think i'm joking if you haven't experienced it yet. i'm not.it isn't my computer. it isn't my internet connection. i have a good computer and a fast connection (fios). besides, if it was client side, everyone in the fleet wouldn't finally load the grid all within seconds of each other (short of the handful who clicked jump first).right. except you can still do this anyway. the only benefit to a gate camp from this bug is if a large fleets jumps in to break up the camp, the camp might only be faced with the first few ships, and thus be able to escape. of course, the logoffski exploit doesn't work if your client isn't loading the grid, because then you cannot log back in because the client will hang on loading the grid again. however, if you face this bug, you have absolutely no intention of pulling a logoffski, as you are in a large fleet purposefully jumping into a system. this bug is connected to a large fleet moving, not something jumping into a large fleet (see the above reference to jumping into empty systems and the client hangs)."

1/22/2010,"ok, this sounds fun: me too i want to play the 'lets fix this as if we are experts' :) in large fleet fights, the server(s) should be able to switch to some sort of 'group' interaction mode. the goal being to split the grid.it would keep this interaction to lets say 'targetting or approach';when you target/approach x, you and x are dynamically moved to a place with ressources(this will be the laggy part). this 'group' will isolate itself from the rest of the system/grid. it will no longer send or process the rest of the grids event in 'realtime', it will focus on its members for processing. when you are in the group, you dont see the other messages (998 other ship's movement/shooting/else) you just really see what you care about, the guys shooting you/repping you/tackling you (it is not ideal, but it would be better than looking at a frozen screen) if you or x is targetted by y, then y joins you in the group.of course your group will 'update' the other groups with what's happening inside, but instead of doing it every second, it could do it every 10 seconds...as for area effects (bombs, smarties...) they would only affect the groups in range and it should minimize the impact of the thing.you could be part of multiple 'groups' but the more groups you are in, the slower you are.also the more crowded the 'group' is, the slower it will get. the fc would finnaly have to use and trust their 'wing/squad commander' maybe a tool could be implemented to allow the fc to assign targets to a wing/squad so they know what to shoot.something like: squad1 engage target1 to target10, squad 1 gets the assignement and will(should) only target whats in the list...it would make it more interresting and would need more preparation for the fcs.and if the group is too laggy, the untargetting would allow you to select other targets (and kill them faster).---the goal would be to divide the fleet fights to smooth things down. of course this is a different mechanism and it will not make everybody happy, but we all agree that 30vs30 lag is not bad, and we all agree that when we are 600 on the battle field, we dont need to know the position of all of them in realtime.anyway, ccp, what you are doing is great, we should all remember the days where 4 players multiplayer games were lagging as hell. now we need to change the way we see big fleet fightsso this is my idea, please comment/add/flame"
1/22/2010,"i've been trying to get into pvp for the last week or so.my problem has been that the barrier to entry is really high. i spent a week looking for some other noob i could kill and i couldn't find anyone.i did fleet up with my corp a couple of times but there are three problems with that: 1) you don't actually feel dangerous or powerful, you just rush to some target and warp scamble them. it's fun but kinda limited. 2) you're just doing as you're told, you're not really thinking about how to win fights and 3) it can take hours for a corp to get a fleet together.i haven't tried faction warfare but i've not heard good things about it. basically it's a gank me toggle unless you group up in which case it's functionally identical to a low sec rove.this is my suggestion.limit faction war to the first 6 months of a character's life. (or possibly an account's life). so it becomes heavily dominated by noobs. the idea is to have an environment where nearly everyone's a noob. at the moment it's just too hard to find pvp that's both empowering and fun if you're new. either you just tag along behind an expert fc or you're free killboardage to the bitter scrapheap challenge veterans who live in low sec.this solves 3 problems:1) noobs can find noob on noob pvp easily. ok there may be some alts in the mix but at least they're not on 3 year old toons with all relevant skills at 5.2) faction war does something different from low sec pvp. at the moment they are both find a mother duck to take you and the other ducklings for a walk experiences.3) faction lp rewards would be exclusively the property of noobs giving new people some attractive income. by making it impossible for veterans to grind these lps in marauders it will be a viable money making option for new pvp players."
1/22/2010,"have you checked out red vs blue? i think it solves the majority, though not all, of the problems you raised. for a background on it, it is two corps that are constantly at war with each other in highsec.people usually use cheap fittings and small ships in the fights and most of them have really low sp. additionally, their hqs are two systems apart so you can find targets with relative ease. perhaps you could try r-v-b out and then come back to see if this suggestion you proposed is really necessary."
1/22/2010,"first, there is a pretty large group of players in eve who would all fly out to iceland and cause violence to the devs if they limited faction warfare to only noobs.there are a few big alliances in the game who have been making recurring threadnoughts because alliances aren't allowed to join faction warfare. i mean, we're talking people who have been with the game since the beginning who have been waiting (that long) for faction warfare. so, gonna have to disagree with the idea of making faction warfare only for noobs.you want to get into pvp. the way to do that is what you are already doing... get together with a group and pvp together.as to the idea of doing what you are told... there really is a lot of autonomy in fleets. autonomy comes with adding new and exciting modules to your fit. tired of tackling? get an ecm frigate, or a bomber, or any of the various other ships designed for other purposes. if it takes hours to get a fleet together, you're doing it wrong.also, people solo in frigates, interceptors, bombers, ecm frigates, etc... at issue may simply be you need to learn how to find targets to solo.join eve university. from what i hear, they take noobs and churn out pvp pilots in about a month. most noob friendly alliance/corp can do the same."
1/22/2010,"i would like the proposal of adding a cloaking bubble, basically deployed the same way as warp bubbles, available in the same sizes.would cloak any ships within range, but would need to be size of bubble + 10km from any objects besides ships or cans/secure cans, so not near a belt to cloak miners or anything like that as the ore would disallow the deployment of the cloak.it would also not allow locking anyone outside the bubble, while your inside or shooting etc.if an enemy gets withing 2500m of the bubble it collapses and won't come back up till the enemy leaves the decloak range. once the bubble collapses you can lock, fire attack , or once you leave its cloak you can fight etc as normal. i think this would be a useful addition for deployment during op staging etc and of course more dasterdly deads, like having a bunch of small frigates hidden right off of a belt a 10-20km from range waiting to spring to action on unsuspecting victims.the cloak depending on size and t1/t2 would have different sizes and also different time frames before they are no longer viable. and disable themselves."
1/22/2010,so you get all the benefits without the penalties of cloaking?doesnt really sound balanced to me.
1/22/2010,"make the bubble visible system-wide, like a cyno, and then it would be ok, you see the bubble but dont know if anyone is inside or notbut that way it wouldnt be so gamebreaking, but then it would be almost useless, so still wouldnt get my support"
1/22/2010,"eve already has enough cloaking in it, and i believe it's fine and balanced the way it is. there is no way to balance your idea realistically, as it is horribly overpowered as is. almost every ship in eve can fit the most basic cloak. you either fit one on your ship, or you don't."
1/22/2010,"for selling and transfering characters its offered to people with credit card's only, which in this time and date is pretty stupid since alot of people like myself don't want credit cards or to touch anything of the sort.which means that loads of characters that people without credit card's or no acces to one that want's to sell the characters they don't use no more are going to waist and not beeing usedetc i have a frieghter pilot and a mission runner pilot that i have no need for any more and wouldnt mind getting rid of but now they are just sitting offline (for about 1 year now) doing nothing and getting dusty with alot of moldy parts lol >_<all that is needed is for ccp to add more payment's such as paypal or cash cards, which im sure isnt to much to ask for and isn't hard . and im sure it will profit for both ccp and the custemers selling characters"

1/22/2010,"i do not support (yet).level 4 mission income nerf is already a hotly contested topic and you are proposing a buff via faster loot/salvage acquisition.i agree there is logical reason to add a tech 2 tractor but 1) level 4 isk boost.2) ccp already said miners are not the main source of high end mineral. reprocessed mission loot is. wtf?i may support this later after these issues are addressed.also, tech 3 ships and marauders already have a tractor beam bonus. they can both do 40km and 1,000m/s beams. (edit: yes there are salvage fit tengus out there).level 4 mission drops average 12,000 isk per m3. i started looting and salvaging again and put all the stuff into giant secure containers. each container sells for 40 million at jita. i could get more isk if i had the reprocessing and broker skills. use someone else and a courier contract to get your cans there or you might explode at a star gate - most mission runners can't fly a transport and badgers are very gankable. edit: orca are **** at salvage as they only have 3 slots and poor lockon times. can fit sensor boosters but can't avoid high slot problem. edit: unless you use 2 account just to salvage ;-)"
1/22/2010,supported
1/22/2010,"supportedsince salvage is now a proffession, ans salvager ii appears, it has a sense to have more ranged tractor beams.but i think it may have really high requirements in terms of pwg and cpu.that way it can be usefull for mission with high range npc, but it will be faster to use more tech 1 or a fastest ship to get just a few cans or when u salvage angels wrecks."
1/22/2010,i agree with this proposal
1/22/2010,supportedor add a skill and make the module bonuses something like:10% speed bonus / level10% range bonus / level@lvl5 it would have 750m/s and 30km range
1/22/2010,"since tractor beams can be used only un stuff belonging to your corporation, the ""ninja salvager"" mini profession does not benefits from it. it would benefit lvl4 mission runners, but they can earn 40 million per hour with a golem and very small risk. there are a number of reason why mission grinding has to be nerfed. once it has been done, i will support the thread."
1/22/2010,"from camiossince tractor beams can be used only un stuff belonging to your corporation, the ""ninja salvager"" mini profession does not benefits from it.it would benefit lvl4 mission runners, but they can earn 40 million per hour with a golem and very small risk. agree too, but instead of nerfing mission runners, i think it will be better to improve others professions.for example, if there were more dangerous npc in belts, and with biggers bounty/loot, there will be more combat players in belt, to support miners, and less in missionning.but, for the tech ii tractor beam, i think its a good idea anyway. also, most new corp members with low skills use salvager to help corporate mission runners. maybe with special ship fitted with special salvage modules, it will become a reasonnable proffession ?"
1/22/2010,"when doing level 4 missions, including salvaging and everything, it often takes me well over an hour to do them (in a dominix). now i realise that a lot of people can do it faster. but even then, it'd be nice if there where 15 minute versions of lvl 4 missions (including looting and salvaging) which would ofcourse be worth only a fraction of the full length equivalent. this will make it much more tempting to do a little mission inbetween other things, instead of investing a much larger chunk of time. you can argue that you can take a break in the middle of a mission if it's too long for you, but it's much nicer to have a sense of completion before you stop playing.so to sum it up:-create a shorter version of lvl 4 missions-shorter missions should be given out by seperate agents from the longer versions, to avoid standing loss issues for people trying to get a shorter mission.-keep the longer versions aswell.-adjust amount of money made in the smaller versions according to time spent so you make the same amount of isk per hour as with the longer versions."
1/22/2010,they already have shorter versions worth less. they're called level 3s.
1/22/2010,"duo of death, 2 bs, 2 spider drones.attack of the drones, if you blitz it,anyway ... the flaw in your proposal is ... you can only reject a mission once every 4hours. (if you like your standing.) so you will have a hard time to make sure you get such short missions everytime you want to run one.suggesting to allow you to reject missions without standing loss will just lead to people farming the good missions. (as we had it nicely illustrated with faction warfare missions)so while it would be nice to have those short missions it would be hard to implement.hope this helps."
1/22/2010,"@ darius: well, i was thinking of adding agents that only give out short missions to fix that problem. if the long missions come from different agents than the short missions do, you don't have that problem."
1/22/2010,well then it should be part of your proposal. an idea fully thought through and presented with all aspects will get more support than a proposal with missing parts.
1/22/2010,"level 3 missions aren't as tough as lvl 4s. i'm looking for a difficulty level similar to lvl 4s, just shorter. besides, level 3s can still take a while..."
1/22/2010,"correct, so i edited my first post to add your suggestion to it."

1/22/2010,i'm not sure about a second tier of links because it would cause not only issues with balance (especially if they are more combat focussed bonuses) but also will add to the nightmare when trying to setup a fleet for an op (making sure bonuses are being given to the right people).of course is isn't up to me so i guess we can try to discuss it as part of the info link proposal.

1/23/2010,"sorry to have to ask this, but do you? do you even know how things work in combat?let me illustrate:phoenix, 4-slot tank.ehp: 2.5m (3.4m with levi bonus)passive recharge: 244 dps (372 dps / levi)let's say that a phoenix survives for two full minutes during a hotdrop. the difference between a phoenix with and without a levi (max skills, 3 siege warfare links, mindlink) is therefore (372-244)*120 = 15360 damage more worth of tank, or roughly 0.4% more damage required from the passive recharge.phoenix, passive t2, 2x invuln, 4x hardeners, shield recharger, 4x shield power relay, damage controlehp: 2.9m (3.95m / levi)passive recharge: 998 dps (1466 / levi)the numbers for this setup gives us: (1466-998)*120 = 56160 damage more worth of tank. this is a whopping 1.4% more damage required to kill it due to the increased passive recharge.ragnarok, 2x estamel's invuln, 4x pith x-type hardeners, shield recharger, 5x shield power relay, damage controlehp: 33.5m (47.7m ehp / levi bonus)passive recharge: 10530 dps (15464 dps / levi)let's assume that we have 50 dreads shooting at it, with an average dps of 3500, a reasonable number assuming a decent hotdrop. this is 175000 dps incoming damage. remove passive tank from the incoming dps numbers, and the unbonused rag will live for 3 minutes, 24 seconds whereas the one with a levi for bonuses lives for 4 minutes, 59 seconds.this means that the passive recharge will add an amazing 1.5m damage required to kill the ragnarok with the leviathan bonus, or a whopping 3.09% more.this surely is game-breaking to the point where it's warranted to nerf shield capitals of their own gang bonuses at every jump. </sarcasm>the shield tanked ragnarok takes just under two hours to fully recharge its shield to max. completely overpowered, amrite? ;) the passive tank fitted phoenix takes an hour and a half to fully recharge its shields. oh, and said ragnarok also takes six and a half hours to recharge its capacitor, making it an impractical setup at best.but what if i just barely have enough dps to break the tank of the ragnarok, and it can now tank us with the additional levi boost?alright, let's assume you could break 10k dps tank, but not 15k dps tank. this is, i admit, an effect of the leviathan bonus that will make it harder for a small gang to kill a supercapital.given the best situation here, you have roughly 5k dps more than the passive recharge. since shield recharge isn't linear, let's assume an average dps against the unbonused titan of 10k dps. this means that the titan that you previously could kill in only 55 minutes, 50 seconds is now invulnerable to your little gang. this i will sadly have to concede, as it's clearly too imbalanced for the game.but what about subcapitals?well, let's take a drake, which has 60k ehp and 600 dps ta... oh, heck. who are we kidding? if you can't kill the drake just because a leviathan gave it gang bonuses, you fail at this game. moot point.bottom line is: you get the peak recharge bonus today. this is generally the key point of a passive tank, not the ehp itself. applying the additional hp immediately won't change the peak recharge bonus. if you're having trouble breaking the peak recharge tank bonus, you fail at this game.shield tanked ships need to get their shield bonus applied immediately. this is especially so for capitals, where the recharge timers can range up to hours."

1/23/2010,"lag isn't contained to a single system, even on reinforced nodesmaking fleets move between systems will only make matters worse"
1/23/2010,"it depends on where in the cluster lag is generated. if it is db related lag, you cannot fight it with my proposal. my proposal can win against node lag, the lag generated by the fact that computing power and bandwidth in a blade are finite, this is the cause of lag in very crowded systems.my proposal does not mean to force people to move between solar system. i want moving fleet to become unpractical, risky and stupid. attacker and defender must decide the location of his forces before the fight, then just slight corrections will be practical.how will this happen?by enlarging the battlefield and/or by reducing the warp speed of battleships in contested systems. if the battlefield is many system wide and bss are slow, moving them around will be difficult and you will not be able to compensate for mistake you made in deployment time. maybe you could add a mechanic that reduces warp speed of ships to 20% of their normal vaule in all the constellation systems when structures are vulnerable and fight can happen, so that bs warp speed are unchanged and deployment before fight becomes more critical. if your bs fleet moves at 0.6 au/s in contested systems when structures are vulnerable, you will not like to have the necessity to move them to go 5 jumps away. with my proposal, you'll have to move your forces to their designed location in advance and be smarter than now.it will be more like a chess match for the strategists, while the pilots will experience less lag.maybe we should use a battlefield larger than 3 system (differently from what i suggested before), and set the whole costellation as the new conquering unit. of course, dimension of battlefield and mobility-nerfing measures are to be balanced based on many factors."

1/23/2010,"here comes an idea where eve as a science fiction game can proof once more to be revolutionary, original and social.imagine you could talk to your computer like in almost every science fiction movie, laying in a course, engage warp, activate weapons, initiating self destruct, all by just saying it. and it is not so complicated as it appears.there are already programs (like pilflus) using the windows speech recognition library, where you can assign keyboard short cuts to customized voice commands. you define what shall be spoken, like ""computer: full stop"" and relate the short cut ""[ctrl, space]"", in result the ship stops. try it out you can do some funny stuff with that. but unfortunately the keyboard commands in eve are limited, a lot of important actions are only done by mouse. as you can not access all functions in eve with the keyboard, you can not assign voice commands for everything with external programs.my request: the functionality of such programs should be implemented directly into eve. the developers should easily be able to access all important functions in the game and assign them to customizable voice commands. they dont have to program the speech recognition itself, that is done by the windows library already, they just have to do the mapping. it would not only be a fantastic feature, pushing the game experience to a new level, it would also give handicaped people acess to eve.one example: ""computer: initiate undock sequence"" -ship leaves station-, ""computer: acess navigational control"" -opens map-, ""computer: set destination: jita system"" -sets autopilot dest. to jita-, ""computer: engage autopilot"" -activates autopilot-, ...as the text is customizable you can say a lot of funny stuff, your fantasy is the limited :)there is a thread in the ideas and discussions forum too:"

1/23/2010,"already exists as an out-of-game tool in the form of voice buddy, software made by edimensional.using software like that on a per-person basis as opposed to expending resources in the form of time, human resources, finances and game-client coding-fluff sounds like a bad idea when there are already a long list of issues that need to be fixed in the existing code.can't support this; too much of a niche interface prone to its own slew of issues that would waste too much time/resources on the part of ccp to develop."
1/23/2010,"problem overview: macro mining is a problem that breaks down and undermines the player driven economy of eve. empire macro mining robs valuable income from new players who choose to make mining a career and encourage rmt from isk farmers.solution overview: original proposal retracted on bases of feasibility..solution mechanics: macro miners use bookmarks to continually warp to a set distance from the field, then they rely on overview settings to warp to the nearest asteroid of choice. proposed solutions should focus on hindering or breaking the efforts of macro miners, while not hindering actual players. solutions should also be simple enough for new players to understand and utilize."
1/23/2010,"this may work for current macro-ers, but not for others. if the 'ore-dust' was the size of a drone, then when selecting show info on it would have the radius incredibly small, and if you just simply make the macro look at the value, you can find out weather the ore is 'ore dust' or an actual rock. so if this was implemented, it would not stop macro mining, but rather stop it until the macro-maker realises how to get his/her macro to see how large the 'roid is. good idea but.(made an alt to post on forums so main doesn't get flamed in game for some reason )"
1/23/2010,"ok, so make them the size of normal roids but a different color."
1/23/2010,"afaik all asteroids have the same sig radius regardless of size. (any program that could read information from the client like that is a bot. bots are not the same thing as macros.)one of the better ideas... though, the 'dust' should be procedurally placed, the server would only need to send a number for the client to reconstruct the belt. the dust would also need to be non-solid, like a gas cloud, to prevent collision issues.cautiously supporting."
1/23/2010,"well as a human miner i use a survey scanner to target asteroids to mine, and this proposal would hopelessly clutter up (and lag to hell) the survey scanner, and basically make it useless, unless the survey scanner could filter out roid dust, and then you'd have the macro bots using that instead of the overview.sorry, but not supported in it's current form."
1/23/2010,"this. and professional macro/bots can recognize different colors. the problem are the professional macro used by isk sellers rings.we are not speaking by something cobbled together in the basement by some computer savvy guy but by programs created by people that get paid for them and that are experts in the field. beside that any mechanism you want to implement should be reasonably acceptable by the people playing for fun or you would get the opposite effect, reducing the number of player miners. the people working for isk sellers are paid for what they do and generally every one of them manage a good number of accounts using macro to do most of the work. if the new mechanic require a check every few minutes (retarget a new set of roids after the macro as destroyed the current targets) the program will need only a warning on the lines of ""i am down to the last set of roids"", then the person managing of the macro group will enlarge the proper window and target a new set of asteroids for the macro to tur into minerals. if you make the mechanic annoying enough the guy that is paid to do that for a 8 hours shift will still do it (maybe a tad slower, but that is all) while the player that pay to ave fun will stop doing something that is no more fun. end result you reduce the player miners and not the isk farmer."
1/23/2010,@ opi think your forgetting the obvious.just how many objects are you going to throw into the grid?can you say... lag city?yup... thought so.not supported.
1/23/2010,this. not supported.
1/23/2010,wont' work.macros would just use an ore scanner and lock the largest quantity rocks. they would then continue to do as they've always done. the only thing it would accomplish is add more lag.
1/23/2010,ditto.
1/23/2010,"personally i just don't see macro miners as a major issue. if you think in terms of eve economics they just aren't a huge problem, in fact they may be a benefit.right now macro miners only mine in high sec areas, meaning that they mostly mine pyrite and tritanium. because of the recent changes with 0.0 space and the ability for any alliance to now mine abc ores in any system in 0.0 there is an abundance of higher metals and a lack of pyrite and tritanium. in fact i've seen mining ops in low sec that are purposely going after scordite and veldspar because there just isn't enough down in 0.0 space. a macro miner will never make as much isk as an active miner that joins a corp in 0.0 space, or even one that is in high sec since they will choose dense and massive over regular ores.the removal of those macro miners would drastically increase pyrite and trit prices which would cause corps to focus their efforts on mining veld and scordite even though they are the less valuable ores simply because they need the ores to manufacture things."
1/23/2010,"there are two ways macro miners could be stopped very quickly.1) pirates are supposed to be defending their roid belts, hence the pirate spawns. increase the pirate spawns in proportion to the amount being mined and the repeativeness of the mining location - ie pirates gain knowledge of ""player"" activites and begin to target specific players in specific areas. new players exempt from this mechanic.2) decrease the value of all high sec roid belts and make larger roid fields available via the exploration mechanism. basically forcing human interaction in mining."

1/23/2010,if the 10 people whining can still play the game on low settings then where is the real problem? they can still play the game exactly as before. if they dont like 'the way it looks' then unfortunately that is a 'personal' preference and not ccp's problem.i am all for splitting the client again. everyone with a laptop from 2002 and equivalent should realise its 2010. the current low settings should become the new 'slim' client whilst ccp should make the current high settings the new 'medium'. maybe then ccp could finally employ a shader model from the last 5 years () as the new 'high setting' and keep up with the award winning graphics that were part of their earlier days.the graphics should have as much 'excellence' as the rest of the game.those of you with rubbish putes please flame away.............
1/23/2010,bring back medium shader!!!!
1/23/2010,"no. if it isn't being used, i would rather ccp devote their time, energy and resources to developing and maintaining other features, and i trust ccp's game logging (and i don't understand why you act like it is so surprising that ccp tracks user settings) over your anecdotal account of it being a ""lot of people""."
1/23/2010,"have you realised that what... 90% of games you can buy have a low and high, and completely skip the medium? if your computer can't handle it, in any sane job you can just work i don't know... a week and buy yourself a top of the range computer, it really isn't that hard to keep up. i say the only people complaining about the removal of medium are the people that are to young to have a job or have one and simply don't value their computer enough to through a mere $1000 (in my currency, much less for anything else) to get a computer that can run absolutely anything on high...edit: also, why is everyone surprised that they look at your client? in the eula there is something about monitoring how you use eve, to send back information and increase reliability/usability. and i didn't even read the eula to know that, it's just basic stuff.anyway, definitely not supported."
1/23/2010,"look, if you never used it, then what do you care? this is for those that used it, be it for hardware restrictions, or because hi-shader looks like crap without aa.those that did use it, did so for a reason and now their entire game-play experience has been changed."
1/23/2010,"if you want csm to raise a proposal it is supposed to be posted in here.irrelevent to the discussion.the easy thing is simply leave your pilot in the supercap in the first place.the point was simply that you are not being forced to buy another account. your combat pilot can remain in the supercap and no alt is required. i'm glad you have lots of money, good for you but it is irrelevent to the discussion.you can own a supercap with a single account without paying a penny to ccp. no metagaming required. simply you have to accept that unless you pass it to another player or leave it at a pos your pilot is going to remain in it till it is destroyed or sold. is this a hard concept for you to understand?ccp are not forcing you to spend any money on extra accounts. you howver want to fly a supercap and want the option to leave it on a whim. sorry but to do that you have to pass it to somebody else or park it at a pos.and you can continue to play the game to become a supercap pilot - but you have to accept that your pilot will be stuck in it.link?you are not being forced to have an alt to fly a supercap! you just have to accept that you can't leave it without handing it to somebody else or parking it at a pos.and you can fly it without an alt if you choose to remain in it.accept the drawbacks and fly a supercap or don't fly a supercap and have the option to fly anything else in game when you like.this is the same argument i've seen in other games where people moan they can't solo everything and shouldn't be forced to team up. however in this case you have the option but have to accept the drawbacks too.what next, moan you can't use it in empire?"
1/23/2010,"not supported.if you don't want to dedicate a pilot to flying a supercap, then you don't really want to fly a supercap."
1/23/2010,"parking it at a pos is not a realistic option. that is the point of the proposal. the idea is to make parking it at what is supposed to be a secure location not tantamount to sticking it next to a jita stargate with the words ""steal me"" sprayed on the side in kilometer high letters.as to the rest of your post, it's clear that we're not going to agree so i shan't waste any more time on the discussion. you are clearly one of those 'everyone must absolutely have alts' types and on that we are never going to agree.(and yes, stating that you must either have an alt or undergo the near impossible in order to play really is the same as saying ""you have to have an alt."")"
1/23/2010,"no one, that i know anyway, dedicates a pilot to flying a supercap.they just dedicate an alt to parking it.ah well, clearly i'm wasting my time here."
1/23/2010,"i certainly didn't say you must have an alt and it isn't impossible to play without one you have the choice to play in a supercap and accept you have to remain in it or play in every other type of ship in game.* the reward for the supercap is superior dps etc* the risk/drawback for a supercap is not having the ability to park it 100% safely without remaining inside it.all supercap owners know this.there are other things in game you can do that will restrict you from doing other things, however:* if i tried to raise a proposal to allow me to be a -10 pirate most of the time but still be allowed to run missions in empire when i felt like it without getting attacked then you would laugh.* if i tried to raise a proposal to allow me to enter gallente space without being attacked while i remain in the caldari militia you would laugh.i could go on but it boils down to this:some things in game require you to make a choice and accept the outcome/drawbacks.i see no compelling reason to put in a change to create less risk considering the huge buff supercarriers just got."
1/23/2010,"do these so called ""the risk is needed"" members even fly super capital ships?all i see here are a bunch of ""self proclaimed experts"" claiming that the risks are acceptable yet i get the sneaking suspicion none of them fly supercaps themselves.how utterly ironic.i don't fly a supercap (obviously) but i know people who do... and i can tell you right now... they don't exactly have a fun time doing it... personally i have no intention of flying a supercap (maybe a cap) if all i have to look forward too is an another damned alt to park my damned ship.... no thanks.there's got to be a reasonable yet better way to do that.using the argument ""he's prob really rich and can afford an extra account"" is totaly stupid and very foolish of an assumption. people who fly super capitals are likely going to lose them... the alliance (hopefully) will likely bankroll his replacements provided he does something in exchange for said supplies... its a teamwork effort... i doubt seriously these pilots have bling bling and fat wallets to boot for this kind of work.even then... the time to take to train a pilot to fly a super-carrier let alone a titan is insane... and not something people would go out of there way to do... aside form ""cheating"" by buying a char already trained up... legitimate in ccp's eyes or not.that's like saying i have a nomad.... and i can afford to pay for plex's in game and not worry about paying the accounts... guess what... nope... can't even afford to replace the damn thing.shocking isn't?so please... stop with the foolish none-sense arguments.... use rationality and common sense for once.parking it at a pos with an anchoring module and passwording it or some such would not prevent theft... in fact it would increase the meta gaming that goes on. somehow i fail to see why people (people who don't fly supercaps) would have a problem with this.pros: supercapital pilot can take a break and fly smaller ships... not so paranoid now.cons: harder to rob the ship... but no different that it would be to compromise a pos shield password and to nick the ship because of a foolish password choice.at least it won't involve pos bowling or something stupid that people tend to think is exploitative... in fact this legitimatize the theft business... kinda nice balance if you ask me.yes... lets keep eve risky... but flying a super capital ship is supposed to be fun.... not a chore that keeps you chained to the damn desk.for once... lets encourage the use of a single char or keeping to a single account.... all your doing is encouraging mass-account use and multiple alt crap.... and if there's one thing we could use less of... is alts."
1/23/2010,"common, peole are you insane? this guy is suggesting that 60+ billion ships instead of magically dissapearing ill be placed at relative ris in the harm`s way? yes!i do frealking support that, let peope anhor motheships within one hour and titans within two, and half the supeecaps instead of magically dissapearing will be always there. that is a very good suggesrion. about passqords-you can use a holing corp for the pos with a cap, it does sound reasonable to be able to password protect ships in space, although that means thag tealing from corp or alliene poses becomes impossible. i am newtral on the whole passwod thing"
1/23/2010,"i have two characters that fly them tyvm.ccp tried to prevent the proliferation of supercaps by making them very expensive - we all know how that turned out ('we expect about three titans in-game at any given time, and only in major alliances' quote from devblog '05). the only thing that is keeping everyone and his dog from having one is the risks and efforts that storing one brings. if you have lots of isk or rl money you can pay for an alt to store it, or for a pos, but there will always be risks involved when swapping the thing (see: constantinee).i stick firmly to the 'if you don't want to dedicate a char to it, you don't really want to fly one'."
1/23/2010,"it is only ironic that i can fly a supercapital ship (almost any carrier pilot in game can fly a supercarrier right now, though training for fighter bombers takes extra time) but have chosen not to fly one because i don't want to dedicate a pilot to it.working as intended methinks. and i know people who fly supercaps and are having a great time with their unique abilities, even more so with the new fighter bombers. it is irrelevant to the discussion.parking the ship at a pos so your character can fly something else is your choice, but it has risk in doing so if you don't trust the others in your corp. if an alliance provide supercapital ships they could also provide somewhere to leave them if required.the cost argument was only brought up because the op complained that ccp were forcing him to pay for a second account just to fly a supercap which we have already proven isn't the case.but any carrier pilot in eve can fly a supercarrier if they wanted. there are factors why people don't (can't afford one, don't accept the drawbacks, didn't think they were useful enough) but that is working as intended.but when you bought the nomad you knew the limitations on it (can't jump into empire, can't jump without a cyno character/alt to assist). you were able to except the limitations on one ship type but think drawbacks on a supercap shouldn't apply.speaking of nonsense, what exactly is the point of allowing a supercap to ""anchor"" at a pos if it doesn't prevent theft? isn't that being what the op is so upset about in the first place?i could make the same arguement about running a pos, i don't want it to be a chore but it is. the reward for the pos chore is isk but i'm not forced to do it. the reward for a supercap is unique abilities but you are not forced to fly one.all we are doing is encouraging people to take responsibility for their choices in game instead of whining that they can't fly a supercap on a single account and fly anything else whenever they like without risk.i and others do not want to see the barrier to entry for supercapitals to be so low that a solo player can decide to fly one casually. they are supposed to be end game ships for alliances to use and whilst solo players can own and fly one they have to accept the drawbacks on that ship. you are not forced to use an alt to park it so the initial argument falls to bits. it might be inconvenient to be stuck in a ship but it was your choiceit isn't rocket science."
1/23/2010,"the most disturbing thing about this thread seems to be that there is no variety of opinion amongst any of the csm members.is this how you guys see a discussion developing, by shooting down a proposal because you all seemingly have a vested interest against it?a post-hoc argument like ""being stuck in a ship comes as part of the risk of flying the ship"", completely made up, is not exactly a good rational one, is it? sounds more like dogmatism to me."
1/23/2010,you saw that too?i would call it something far more explicit but then i'd get banned. : o p
1/23/2010,"because two csm members giving feedback represents the whole of the csm notice (on the subject of variety) that you are getting the same reaction to this proposal from supercap and non supercap pilots within the csm.perhaps rather than pointing at the csm as being biased you should instead examine the proposal (except there isn't one).would you rather i reserved my comments for when we are in session and can vote the proposal down without public discussion?surely by being open about the reason i dislike the proposal i am giving the op a chance to look at it from another point of view and possibly amend it. of course the op decided against actually making a proposal in here (even after i pointed this out) preferring instead of a proposal to link to a nice story about how he has a dream to fly every gallente ship in game and that evil ccp won't let him without an alt.as we have said, you do not need an alt to fly a supercapital thus that argument is fail.you might choose to have an alt (or a trusted friend) look after the ship for you when you decide to fly something else, but that is up to you.you might choose to leave it parked at a pos unoccupied but that is your choice and part of the risk is that somebody in your corp/alliance might nick it (this is no different to leaving stuff in a public corp hanger).except that the argument is not made up, it is fact and thousands of players have been willing to accept it in exchange for the powerful benefits you get from a supercapital.i'll spell out my objectionsupercapital proliferation is not in the best interests of the game.one of the controls on their use is the cost, but these days even non sov holding alliances can afford them. another control is their inability to dock which means they cannot be insured (default payout only) and that it requires a greater level of commitment from a player's character in wishing to fly one because they cannot park it 100% safely.in exchange for those restrictions you get a superior ship. imagine that, a concious choice for flexibility in which ships you fly or be stuck in one uber ship instead. capital ships already have limitations on use, supercapitals just take that one step further."
1/23/2010,"i don't care if it makes something ""less fun"" or ""less challenging"". boo-hoo. adapt. thing is, this limitation makes no sense within the confines of the game universe.in short:game world coherence > gameplay issuesthus: supported"
1/23/2010,"erm, did you even think about what you posted.op is the one who doesn't want to adapt this limitation has been with supercaps since they were introduced.anyway this isn't going anywhere, people are trying to point the finger at the csm for being biased, trying to point the finger at ccp for ""forcing"" them to have an alt which we've shown isn't the case.some decisions in game mean you can't do other things, i've shown that is the case (here is another example, if i choose to join factional warfare on the gallente side i shouldn't complain that caldari faction police now shoot at me if i decide i actually want to go to jita).if the op actually posts a proposal instead of a cool story then either get one of the csm to raise it or use the following procedure from page 17 of the csm devblogi apologise for attempting to discuss issues with the playerbase, i guess people would rather discussions were in private"
1/23/2010,"10 minutes sounds good since it allows the alert miner more than enough time to switch to a hauler and empty out the can if he's not able to fight back at all. and at the same time, it wouldn't be quick enough to force him to be glued to his screen at all times."
1/23/2010,"definitely supported. but i have a few additions.make it so that it is a module that they use, preferably in the high slot so that they may have to sacrifice one of their weapons to hack cans. make the module like a salvager, so that it has a cycle time, but has a random chance of succeeding, and make the cycle time 5min. and the chance of succeeding be 25% so at lev 5 ssh (discussed next point) you would have a 50% chance of succeeding every cycle.make the skills hacking and ssh change this cycle time/% chance of success. for hacking you have a 5% better chance of success per cycle, and for ssh you have a 5% less cycle time per levelmake a module that miners can use that ""disrupts"" the signal used by the hackers. this would have a very low chance of succeeding (otherwise hacking secure containers would be pointless) and a cycle time of 1 min. unlike a warp disruptor, once it works it doesn't stop the hacker, it more freezes the hackers progress until the anti-hacking module cycles another time, and then it has another very low chance of freezing the hacker again. (i can imagine how hard this would be to code, so if ccp wants, they could just not implement this)hope you can understand the ideas... i think i didn't really explain them clearly...edit: blah, forgot something from the miners side, now this has a 4th point...that's all i can bring to this idea."
1/23/2010,"supported in general, i'll leave balance suggestions to the pros."
1/23/2010,yes.
1/23/2010,"not supported. it could be used just as another form of canflipping, and would destroy the gsc's usefulness, as the container's owner may be unable to or incapable of preventing the theft. either due to the inability to field a force against the can hacker (nothing stopping a cruiser or bc from doing it, and jetcanning the stuff for an industrial) or not being online or in the area.mining already has plenty of ways to force loss of safety and risk. it doesn't really need more."
1/23/2010,when the skill is at lvl 5 it would allow you to hack and take over ownership of off line poses. so you could starve pos off fuel and hack it.
1/23/2010,"i get the feeling that is just another one of those posts designed to run solo or small group miners out of the business, and enrich the big 0.0 groups and larger mining consortiums."
1/23/2010,"i honestly fail to understand how hacking gsc's is gonna drive miners bancrupt, most of em use jetcans anyway+ you have to hack the container again for every portion of ore. although it begs the question: how about these containers anhored in low-sec? it should also count as aggression so that if container is anchored next to a pos, anyone hacking it will be shot by the pos."
1/23/2010,"surely you have to fight anyway in 0.0 and lowsec and you have the option for anchoring the can in a safespot, if you use it just for storage. it would mean, that you couldn't just leave them laying around all over the place.in highsec you are still protected by concord. the hacker maybe flashy to you, but he can't freely initiate aggresion or access the can until the hacking is done. during that time you can just fly to the can and empty the contents. he can try to suicide you or just leave with nothing. he can't do a canflip, since he can't unanchor the can. he can just clean up unattended secure cans that he has managed to find.it would change the nature of secure cans though. it would still give you limited protection even when you anchor it where others can find it, but you couldn't just leave them laying around or you will risk losing the content. i'm not a secure can user, so i'm not going to support or bash this implementation, but i like the idea of deepening some of the current skills, and hacking is one of the more obvious skill to develop."
1/23/2010,"nope not suppoerted.for many reasons:1) a secure can is a secure can - notice the wording ""secure"".2) decrypting secure information takes days to years with todays technology based on 128 bit encoding. quite frankly 10 minutes is stupidly insulting.3) it's basically making a feature of the game redundant, it's a feature to be used not abused. if you are that way inclined just remove the feature.4) the obvious defence would be to deploy hundreds of cans making the task of hacking worthless, creating more lag.5) why the continued knock on miners ? i'm not a miner but quite frankly i've had enough of this crap, it's time the we saw some reverse of the action in the capsuleer comunity. given the long suffering of miners all mining activities should receive a boost and mining ships should gain some teeth.6) there is no valid reason why things shouldnt be left as they are, this feature would only be used by a very small number of eve players and the net result in secure cans no longer being used results in a complete waste of time in development."
1/23/2010,can you give some examples please?
1/23/2010,"] (notify) dual light pulse laser ii deactivates as patchkord begins to explode.so, nothing changed"

1/23/2010,yup still not fixed
1/23/2010,"i support the topic.however i dont think the thought processes are fully engaged. capsuleer ships should improve in relation to the demands within the economy, in other words given the out and out attacks on mining vessels the manufactureers should respond in kind and give the vessels both sustainability and teeth.the civ ship angle is stupid,, these are capsuleer vessels not civilian ships, in the case of hulks they are meant to with withsantd the rigours of 0.0 space never mind highsec ganks.supported but go further. suggest they get a tank and drone bonuses similar to gallante."
1/23/2010,"based on the recent changes to how large mass ships now enter warp, we are left with inaccurate representations of ship warp alignment, especially on ship undock or being bumped.one possible idea is to use a transparent arrow as the direction needed for warp and then to use another transparent arrow to represent where the ships inertia (direction it is currently moving towards) is pulling it, once these two align with each other the ship is aligned for warp and all that is needed is 75% of max speed, which is already represented by the 2nd notch on the hud speed display.most likely a timed rotation of ship would be needed to decently show alignment of ship."
1/23/2010,"i see this working best as some version of the old pre-exodus spinning globe display from the bottom-right of the screen, that became the overlay. the ship model can do what it likes to get as close as possible to some kind of realism, but it'd be very useful to have an accurate visual display of the current velocity vector, and destination vector.as it is atm, whatever tweaks are made to the way the model displays it's still a compromise between accurately depicting what your ship is actually doing in the game, and a fake realism imposed on top for the sake of visuals."
1/23/2010,supported.(op don't forget to support your own thread!)
1/23/2010,"ugh, one of those days, ty for reminding me.btw i also think that these 'alignment arrows' should appear when warp is requested, probably not something everyone wants to see and certainly should become a removable option for those with limited cpu/gpu power."
1/23/2010,"supported.one addition i would like to make, if you highlight something in the overview, an arrow would pop up, so that it's not just for warping (i would use this in low sec to stop getting ganked by gate camps trying to get to my base)edit: forgot the support button..."
1/23/2010,"i've noticed that there are some rather redundant messages for bonus skills in some ships. take the cerberus for example:""caldari cruiser skill bonus: 5% bonus to kinetic missile damage and 10% bonus to missile velocity per levelheavy assault ship skill bonus: 10% bonus to heavy assault and heavy missile flight time and 5% bonus to missile launcher rate of fire per level""this ship requires caldari cruiser v before you can even fly it, so why list this information in the description this way? i can understand listing the heavy assault ship bonus, because you only need level 1 in that skill to fly the ship and the rest is optional.so i propose that this ship description and all others using the same method change to reflect more accurate information. in example:""this ship has a standard bonus of 25% to kinetic missile damage and 50% bonus to missile velocity per levelheavy assault ship skill bonus: 10% bonus to heavy assault and heavy missile flight time and 5% bonus to missile launcher rate of fire per level""a period on the ends of those sentences wouldn't exactly hurt either. thanks for your time,eurlanthe society of innovation"
1/23/2010,"/signedit make sense, and it will be clearest in most minds"
1/23/2010,yes i see that as a very important issue aswell.
1/23/2010,"i'm not supporting this for the simple reason that ccp has, and could, changed skill prerequesites for things, and doing so in the future would now reuiqre them to make multiple edits. forget to make one, and you can bet the next whinge post on the forums will be ""zomg why am i not getting my full bonus as listed in the ship description!??!!)!@#!$elventy!@!@!#!!!!!!one!!""the current descriptions make perfect sense - as long as you think about what they're saying."
1/23/2010,should make things a bit simpler. good idea!please don't put the entirety of the subject in all caps.
1/23/2010,supporting my own idea. reworking the store so shipping costs are sane would bring in a lot of cash as well as provide free advertising. eve loot = free advertising= more ppl subscribe
1/23/2010,"two things are related in belt mining :1 : macro miners can mine safely, and they do2 : mining interest miners... and that's all, other players consider mining as a really boring activitymy proposal :upgrade the npc's in belt, and give them more abilities, like ecm/eccm, warp scramble...that way, mining will require more fighters to defend the operation, oriented combat players will prefer helpminers if there were more dangerous opponent (and bounty and loot related, but minerals should be more profitablethan just killing rats).it will probably take some times before more combat players really want to help miners, but if they dont, the prices ofminerals will go up, so to help keeping price low, they'll have to help.corporate mining will become more attractive, and solo mining will become more difficult => encourage players to join corps and play together.what do you think of this?have you any other idea that can help against macro miners and encourage other players to play with miners ?"
1/23/2010,and how lone players in paper-thin mining barges would defend themself?you cant -require- everybody to pay for multiple accounts.
1/23/2010,"i disagree, lone players can be part of corporation, eve is a mmo, not a stand-alone."
1/23/2010,if there's one thing eve doesn't need its a mining nerf.
1/23/2010,"joining a corp is an option, not a -requirement-mmo means you play in a game where lots of people are present, not that you are required to be chummy chummy with them."
1/23/2010,"currently there's no rats in 0.8-1.0 systems at all, am i right? new players can mine in those systems with their paper-thin ships. 0.5-0.7 systems should see some upgrade to rats yes, currently there's no point going to a belt with combat ship as the rat bounties and loot is minimal. not too big upgrade though, as it would make ratting in low sec pointless."
1/23/2010,"yes,and it will also encourage miners , even solo, to mine in the same belt than others.you can profit even in solo, if there are other players who mine/protect miners.its just a way to improve the mining system, in a more interactive way. also, lot of low lvl mission runner, or low lvl miners could help in protecting mining op, and it will be a good way to learn how to fight stongest ia npc, further, thoose players were able to move in wh or in low sec belts, with less fear.by the way, 0.0 belt could be really dangerous, and it will be more difficult to farm belts just to make cash, and the most valuable ore will be more profitable too, due to the difficulty to mine."
1/23/2010,then don't whine that you can't do this and that.
1/23/2010,"so, what about this proposal?if someone have a good solution against macro miners, and to encourage players to play more with miners, and in more different way than just haul...i'm open to all suggestions, but i really think improving danger in belts could help miners and industrial corporations, cause if there are less macro miners, minerals will be worth the cost, and if combat players can be part of mining operation, they'll can get some paiement for this, so they dont loose isk due to increasing price (at the begining, it will automatically up prices of minerals), cause they could gain money by helping miners."
1/23/2010,"no. combat pilots who are interested in fighting tougher npcs have many options. they can go to low and null sec systems. they can run complexes. they can run missions. they can go down wormholes and tackle sleepers.there are already plenty of reasons for miners to fleet up -- mining foreman, mining director, needing a hauler, the orca, ...its high sec for a reason. safe from other players, no. safe from npcs after a certain level of training, yes. (as a month-old industrial character i still had trouble with anything worse than .7 rats and retrievers can't mine solo in .5 without insane drone and shield tank skills).everyone always wants to ""solve"" the macro-miner issue by making the game worse for real players who like mining. how about this idea? if you're 100% certain that a given miner is a macro then report it to ccp and they'll deal with it. otherwise let us industrials mine ore, make stuff, and haul it to sell in your favorite mission hub so you can supply your combat ships as you go after the tougher npc listed above."
1/23/2010,"no.make them smarter instead.if a mining op is on and a wave of rats is killed, the next one should reflect what the npc faction has learned since. either have them ""keep an eye"" on the op by sending small scout gangs once in a while and wait for the op to go soft, or they could - in low sec, at least - sweep the belt every once in a while with overwhelming numbers. in 0.0, rats should really adapt. if this is their sov space, they ought to usually return with fleets that are determined precisely by the expected opposition."
1/23/2010,"i agree roid belt rats should be increased and some kind of mechanic perhaps to even see pirate factions spawn their own bases and even begin mining themselves, i mean why not - brings the game to life.i do agree miners should not be singled out as free for all targets as seems to be the case atm,,, so some care and attention here but i do think it's not unreasonable for miners to gang up more.here's something i posted on another thread as some other options:there are two ways macro miners could be stopped very quickly.1) pirates are supposed to be defending their roid belts, hence the pirate spawns. increase the pirate spawns in proportion to the amount being mined and the repeativeness of the mining location - ie pirates gain knowledge of ""player"" activites and begin to target specific players in specific areas. new players exempt from this mechanic.2) decrease the value of all high sec roid belts and make larger roid fields available via the exploration mechanism. basically forcing human interaction in mining."
1/23/2010,this is not drone damage mods.
1/23/2010,"pharon what you're saying makes sense. not sure how people don't understand it.i can tl;dr this though.tl;drserver only sends notifications for others firing when you are the one being shot at. so, you will not see your friends being shot, but it doesn't matter because you have turret effects off anyway. yes, the server has to notify you that x person is shooting x, there doesn't need to be any analysis of code to assume this. yes, generating larger packets takes up more memory, imagine that. i highly doubt this is already implemented as it's a pretty obscure thing to change server side operations based on client side visual settings."
1/23/2010,locked. no content.
1/23/2010,i hadn't and it sounds ideal.please consider this suggestion withdrawn for now.
1/23/2010,"tabs would be useless for the security issue i'm referring to. people on probation would just wait until they weren't on it anymore to steal stuff.i understand a complete overhaul is needed, but this seems like a simple enough idea to implement while the overhaul is done, perhaps that's being naive."
1/23/2010,what happens if the sma or tower is taken offline?
1/23/2010,"the major problems of owned station and pos is the ""offline"" condition.maybe its time to think about this, and find another system?i dont know how exactly, but its the eternal problem, whats the meaning of a pos or station if its offline? i agree the building needs some fuel/ressources, but the ""offline"" status can perhaps be changed by a ""low capacity"" status, or something?"
1/23/2010,"infowar warfare links have indifferent performance at best, and are only used in very niche situations, in which case it would still be better to bring a different ship to the fight rather than an eos.as gallente are mainly armour tankers, i propose moving the armour warfare links from amarr to gallente, and giving amarr a new set of capacitor based warfare links; possibly one for cap amount, one for cap recharge and another for cap use.please comment."
1/23/2010,"please read the meeting minutes from jan 3rd where we discussed information warfare links and passed a proposal to improve them.there was even another proposal about info links raised here a couple of days ago, we don't need another thread..."
1/23/2010,"whilst it's encouraging to see the csm bringing this point up, unfortunately the proposal detailed on jan 3rd isn't very good. it still leaves us with an ecm ganglink which is still rather niche and not particularly effective (and rather un-gallente), and some sort of probe bonus ganglink, which is even more circumstantial and will probably be used less than the eos is used now.ganglinks should offer broad bonuses that affect all of the fleet, not just affect the ecm ships and tacklers. with the proposed change people will still not bother bringing the eos because its just not useful enough.without providing any bonuses to 'offensive' modules, the proposal above would allow ganglinks to provide bonuses to shield, armour, speed and capacitor. the four foundations of a ship, and fleet's, tanking ability."
1/23/2010,"well, i like this idea, but i would treat it like a regular cloak on a ship.give the negative bonuses that you would get from the regular cloaking.also i would suggest forcing people to at least have covert ops at 4 make tech i, tech ii, & covert ops models.there are a lot of other small details that could be applied to this, because this could give people a major boost. but this could also be majorly just think of it,stealth bomber perma cloak would be so over powered."
1/23/2010,so basically you can make a safe spot. anchor said cloaky bubble. go rat in 0.0 without the penalties of having to fit a cloak. then when someone comes in local you warp to your cloak bubble in total safety.this is a troll right?
1/23/2010,"dude, you're delusional, besides being completely off topic, and having posted nothing worth of reading.so who's the troll again?so, putting the thread on tracks to avoid the pack of *****-flinging monkeys:1- scanning is unchanged. whoever scans finds the first room. of course if they gate into an unlocked room, they'd be able to warp in there, if they bookmark, warp out, and warp back in to bookmark.2- fleet dynamics remain unchanged. whoever gates into mission space for the first time will have to run through the gates.3- there will be no mission time increase of any kind, and in no situation. it's in fact all the contrary, everybody would be able to benefit from mission bookmarks if they'd so desire. of course if you don't have a reason to bookmark and warp out, this addition doesn't benefit you.4- these assumptions are plain wrong. it's simply idiotic to even think that you or anybody else canalwaysaccept a missionrun itfinish itwithout interruption.oh well, you (as in anybody) might be one of those basement gremlins that doesn't have a social life, but otherwise people for example have friends, relatives, bathroom needs, and similar, and at some point you will leave a mission (if you mainly pve, of course), and will surely be grateful that you don't have to pass every single gate back in, when you can bookmark your cleared rooms.it's all of the contrary in fact, unexperienced mission runners will know that it's ok to warp out quickly, since they will have the option to return to mission when they have refitted or better prepared (for example losing mob aggro), much quicker than before.indeed, there are no contrary points. all of them exist already, and for every disadvantage, theres an outweighting benefit.5- mwds in alternative to bookmarks. if bookmarks aren't allowed, at least allow people to travel to the next gate using an mwd (afterburners are ""a-ok"", but a battlecruiser still takes ages to cover 30 kilometers.)6- rooms are still locked by gates. the only advantage is that if you clear the room, you can bookmark and warp in later.regarding pvp, carebears would have a better card to play, since it'd take a just a pretty quick refit (you could run missions with scramblers/ core stabilizers, etc., in your cargo) to get back in mission space to face your griefers.pvp gets a boost, and carebears have a better chance to defend their missions."
1/23/2010,what about a cash card can you not use that to track scammers in same way?
1/23/2010,"create a new interface for roles. put in features that are graphic, intuitive and descriptive.1. have a pop up that tells exactly that role does and does not allow.2. have preset role configurations for corps with standardized security arrangements and roles, for mining corps, wormhole corps, trading corps, pvp corps and so on, as well as a general preset. this could be set by the ceo quickly and easily at corp creation, and then modified later as needed.3. be able to mark some hangars as secure and have a pop up if someone is being given improper access.4. add role changes to the journal, viewable by ceo and directors, with blinking and highlighting similar to the wallet.5. add journal entries for inventory control, with the ability to log two or more hangars. access through the corp api. this will allow the creation of a web app that can alert people if a hangar is accessed, or create parameters for an alert.6. create an alliance drop rights system for the alliance executor corp, so they can deliver stuff directly. could be a special contract type similar to a haul contract that automatically unpacks in the right hangar. you could also do an ""automatic deliver"" feature that puts things in the right hangar when received from an alliance member.*editthe goal is to allow for secure logistics and easy delivery of supplies. this will allow for an easier division of labor in an alliance, so that corps can specialize better."
1/23/2010,we have already discussed something about roles and permissions but if you think it doesn't cover this issue then please raise it in the assembly forum
1/24/2010,bump
1/24/2010,i like this idea. could make for some very interesting things in game.
1/24/2010,"i've actually liked to have the ability to see where my bookmarks on when i'm near there. as such, i support this idea."
1/24/2010,supported.
1/24/2010,karma supports.
1/24/2010,supported.
1/24/2010,"ok, i haven't played for 6 weeks because i've been working overtime and 7 days a week making stuff for the real military and you're telling me that ccp is going to try to send an industrial character -- i bought my first myrm today, after playing for a year -- multi-jumps into a low-sec war zone where, unless i bring my entire alliance with me, i'm going to lose ships and good implants for no more reward than a cheap implant?what part of the many threads stating clearly that industrial characters will go to low-sec when the profits available there -- after subtracting the losses and the cost of paying people to watch us mine -- are reliably greater than the profits in high-sec are these people failing to understand?ccp cannot force people who don't think that getting blown up and losing money is fun into low-sec. even if they eliminated high-sec completely we wouldn't do it, we'd just quit playing. throwing industrialists in to sink or swim isn't going to result in anything but a firmer resolution to never leave high-sec for any reward short of a completely-fitted, faction hulk and a rigged itty 5 loaded to the gills with zydrine.people who think that pvp combat is fun are already doing pvp combat. let those who enjoy that play style enjoy it. let those who enjoy selling them ships and ammo and doing our pvp in the market enjoy that. it doesn't make any more sense to force me to run pvp missions than it would make to force dedicated pvp players to run mining missions."
1/24/2010,"supported, can't see any real drawbacks"
1/24/2010,"well -- i agree this is a fantastic idea, but that csm link says nothing about a sort function for meta level. it just says they will implement a meta id in the item info. or am i wrong? plus dominion still doesn't have this implemented, although the former idea was/is. /bump-pwnage"
1/24/2010,"the idea is already going to be implemented, in either the next patch or the next expansion. it has been reviewed by the csm and i quote the pdf of a csm meeting: ""ccp agrees it is trivial and that it will get done.""if you want the link to see yourself,"
1/24/2010,"would be really good feature, and hope that this gets implemented (kinda losing my hopes on ccp ever doing anything right...)"
1/24/2010,if ccp adds a column for meta lvls to the list/detail view- then it accomplishes pretty much want you want. you can go to list view- and sort by columns. items can be moved in this view just like they can in icon view.its not exactly the same as what you want- but in the end it accomplishes the same thing.edit to say- the only difference i can see is that in icon view you can click blank area and sort by (whatever). and in the detail/list view you have to click the top header to sort by that column
1/24/2010,yes.
1/24/2010,with so many systems this fix might be the biggest update ccp would ever need to do but with dust coming out sometime soon. (i hope) having the planet say its 5k and having the dust players walking around in shorts would really be a big oversite.i would also like to see planets orbit the suns. another cool fix would that the planets can't be jumped/flown though.
1/24/2010,"supported, but i think it should be more yellowish/orange than red"
1/24/2010,"a change is needed: i suggest1) for concord kills, reduce payout as player sp increases; new players make silly mistakes and get full insurance; professional gankers need to choose their targets. 2) have prices adjusted, because i cannot make money with suiciding in verge vendor with dominix or myrmidon, and barely a profit with an unfitted catalyst. so not convinced a change is needed here."
1/24/2010,d'uh!seems like an idea long past due.perhaps separate messages like this from the client to a secondary window option that we with more than one monitor can use to free up client space.

1/24/2010,"as it stands, when the ""based on standings"" setting is used for the fleet finder, corporation and alliance members cannot join the fleet unless the fc sets every corp in the alliance blue. shouldn't it allow them by default? if not, why was it designed this way?"

1/24/2010,"as far as i get it, voice buddy is not compatible with eve. you can only assign the short cuts eve provides. but in eve there is no key for going to warp or setting a destination or docking and so on. so you cant access these actions with voice buddy. the developers would have to add those short cuts/ keyboard commands to make it work with external programs. if they dont want everything to be accessable with keys for blocking makro-scammers they have to implement the functions of the external program. so you assign the voice command directly in eve and no new short cuts show up to the end user. if you can show me a program what can set a destination in eve i would be happy, i have found none so far."
1/24/2010,"hi i think it is time for the salvage owner ship to be sorted out.i am sick of being told that it is game mechanics.all i ask is that there is an element of risk for the salvage thieves.so please alow me to treat salvage thieves as i would ore thives or can flippers.allow me to shoot them with out fear of being destroyed by concord.to me it is an exploit, useing concord as protection for thievery.if salvage is not mine as i have been told on many occations why then is it named and flagged with my corp and alliance name on it?if you want salvage do as i do and run missions for it.so please clear up this unfair system.ps i hope that my post meets with your exacting standards for posting as i am not the best typist in the world and would hate to think i offend your you with my lack of skill with a key board."
1/24/2010,hear hear! it would be nice to shoot the thieving lazy gits.
1/24/2010,"i agree with this proposal. ownership of salvage should be available, now that we can freely abandon the wrecks, that shouldn't be a problem."
1/24/2010,"yes it's time salvage thieves get flagged like can flippers, lets put some risk in this reward."
1/24/2010,that's a coincidence: we're sick of telling you that it is game mechanics.the solution seems obvious.
1/24/2010,"you know, in a way you're right. people shouldn't be getting rewards like that for no risk. so lets make combat mission deadspaces in to little lo-sec pockets. then you can kill those naughty salvagers whenever you like - even before they 'steal' any of 'your' precious salvage. that way everyone who gets rewards also gets risks.sound good?"

1/24/2010,yes this is the replies i think need changing i think that you should be allowed to defend your work salvage.regardless of the current stand on the salvage theft it needs to be discussed.not dismissed out of hand.this is a forum for me to air my grievencies not be told i am wrong.my oppinion is as valid as every ones.so let those who think this needs changing have there say.
1/24/2010,good way of luring players into shooting the ninja so he can come back with his bs and kill the mission runner.supported :)
1/24/2010,"no. there are several problems with the op's idea. primarily being that salvaging is not theft, secondly; the wrecks are not owned and therefor cannot be stolen. thirdly, that nice long set of quotes from ccp the other guy posted is reason enough for this not to be an issue.this is something that is wrong with your post specifically; you make an appallingly commonplace logical fallacy here. the fact that you are allowed to press the buttons on your keyboard and then press the post button with your mouse does not make your opinion as valid as, for example, that of malcanis, or infact of anyone else for that matter. you also make the fallacious assertion that your right to whine on a open forum concerned with balancing game issues in any way supercedes or is more holy than the right of other forum users to call you out for making idiotic points that have been repeated ad nauseum and refuted ad nauseum. *edit* oh, and also you are wrong; this is not a forum for you to air your grievances, this is a forum for you to try and contribute in someway to ongoing issues regarding balance in eve online.if you want to air grievances, go to general discussion, c&p or caod; your tears will be drank up as if they were ambrosia itself."
1/24/2010,ok sorry for trying air what i think is a flawed game mecanic.but while this issue has been discussed again and a gain it still is wrong that you can profit from others work with no risk to your self.if the salvage thief shot the rat in your mission then yes the salvage belongs to them.just as when a miner shoots an astaroid the ore belongs to the miner.so why does the salvage from my mission have to be differant from ore shot from a roid?
1/24/2010,"the wrecks belongs to you, the salvage is the result of *their* activation of the salvager module.of course if you put your salvage into a can and they steal it, then you can shoot them. but why would you jettison your salvage?"
1/24/2010,supporting every single pro-salvage flipping thread since 2009.
1/24/2010,for this reason supporting.death to mission runners.
1/24/2010,fixed it for you. not everyone running missions does not know from which end to hold a gun.
1/24/2010,"even if you know how to shoot back, your pve fit ship would normally melt against pvp fit ships. or how long does your tank last with a neut or 2 on you?"
1/24/2010,"as a ninja salvager, i support this topic.sometimes the wrecks are all empty and i can't flag myself on anything ."
1/24/2010,"but it is intended mechanics and there is no problem.because there is so much risk for the mission runner by comparison right ?yes, because that worked out particularly well for miners.you ought to re-read the definition of exploit.it isn't, it's not even salvage until it's in the salvager's cargo hold. pls show me a picture of an npc loot can that has salvage in it.why should all players do as you say ?there's nothing unfair about it, even ccp have said salvage was not introduced to give you mission runners more income, it was to facilitate rig building and to create a mini profession of salvaging. perhaps you should be asking for salvage to be removed entirely, that would be fair. it is in fact you mission runners who gain ""unfair"" extra income from salvage by virtue of the fact that it's introduction was not meant for your benefit but it was unavoidable that you would benefit as a bi-product.that said i support this issue as i want to laugh at you all getting owned in ur pve ships when you get what you ask for"
1/24/2010,"you aired your grievances and we told you that you are wrong. bingo! everyone wins!no it isn't. your opinion may be as valid as say, mine but it certainly isn't as valid as any of those gms that larg quoted above. when it comes to opinions, some very much matter more than others."
1/24/2010,the salvage is not yours until its in your cargo hold
1/24/2010,"insa rexion...""yes, because that worked out particularly well for miners."" errr, miners didnt have big effing guns last time i checked... douche."
1/24/2010,"on the other hand ratting and missioning ravens, maelstroms etc... are notorious for being universally superior to their pvp equivalents in every possible way, and totally dont have to worry about their imba active tanks getting pwned by eneutage...douche."
1/24/2010,erm. talking about miners. douche.
1/24/2010,"absolutely not. how about we get rid of salvage if you're going to whine about it and not read up on the reasoning behind the decisions that ccp made?fact is - salvage was added as a bonus to the loot system, not an entitlement. you already have loot that flags people for theft. be happy with that."
1/24/2010,"well done on getting the point bro let me spell it out for you. the guy is saying that missioners would have about as much success dealing with ninja salvagers as miners have with griefers. incase you arent aware, that means next to no success at all. so yeah......douche"
1/24/2010,"in the real world salvage rights encompass the whole ship and cargo. i.e first person to get a rope on an abandoned ship takes all. in reality salvage companies will sell the wreck back to the original owner for a sensible price. thus you could make a strong case that all wrecks be treated in the same way including all the loot of course that would be rather harsh on mission runners in a game, so we have the current system where a wreck is flagged as ""owned"" by you/your corp along with anything inside it. but, this contains only loot, not salvage! ccp have stated that salvage doesn't exist until a successful cycle from a salvager at which time some salvage appears in that ship's cargohold and the wreck ""owned"" by the mission runner turns into a can. thus nothing is being stolen as such, all that is happening is that one person is depriving another of the opportunity to also try their luck with a salvager. this is just another form of player vs player. for example you killing mission rats has deprived that other player of the chance to kill them and get bounties it would be funny if mission runners could fire on salvagers without getting concorded because all that would happen is ninja salvagers would use battleships tanked against the damage you are using on the rats and they would be setup to fire a type of damage you are not tanked against in return. i.e. it wouldn't stop the salvaging but it might cause more mission runners to lose their pve ships.there are frequently poorly thought out proposals that don't take the wider implications into account and this is another one (and the issue has already been raised and rejected many times)."
1/24/2010,"ok, proposal retracted on bases of feasibility. instead of focusing on one idea, id like to turn this thread into a discussion area for solution suggestions. so far some smart ideas have been put forward and i would like to keep this discussion going."
1/24/2010,"definitely, whilst eve is graphically very good looking in the ways of detailed models, textures, lighting and shaders, but lacks gravely in the ""detail"" department, whilst most particle effects look good, they're too repetitive and stale, there is little in the way of animation, and in general is quite immersion-breaking.as an addition, i think impacts on your ship whilst your shields still are up, shouldn't hit the hull itself, but rather be stopped a small distance from it (about the same distance as the shield booster effect?) with a special ""shield-impact effect"".supported."

1/24/2010,yes plz!
1/24/2010,"this idea has been going around for the better part of 2009, and i thought 2010 would be a good time to bring it up until it goes through. please support this thread until it makes it in-game. read below for quick update of status and requested game mechanic. all previous threads were locked due to inactivity, and the functionality discussed (and implemented in-game for dominion is not what was requested to the assembly).well -- i agree this is a fantastic idea, but that csm link says nothing about a sort function for meta level. it just says they will implement a meta id in the item info. or am i wrong? plus dominion still doesn't have this implemented, although the former idea was/is. /bump-pwnage"
1/24/2010,"are there any columns in any tabular data display in eve that you cannot sort by ? it seems to me, that adding the column will make it inherently sortable.anyway thumbs-up from me, since this really needs to be added as soon as possible!"
1/24/2010,"on a few occasions i have been ganked on low sec gates while coming out of warp by smartbombs. in addition to losing smaller ships to this, the stargate won't allow you to jump in your pod because of the session change from losing your ship and thus getting podded as well.i don't believe that one should be able to get destroyed without even being able to fight back in the first place.so i propose that a ship should not be able to take damage while coming out of warp so that it will allow a person to defend themselves somewhat.even when a person initiates a warp and their ship starts to go into the warp bubble mode, all damage is then negated which should be the same when coming out of warp.i don't mind ganking, its part of the game, but getting blown up and podded before you even finish loading the grid should be fixed. thanks."

1/24/2010,"my income is indeed high enough to buy an up-to-date computer that can virtually run anything software wise on the market today. it's just that i have a wife and three kids to take care of. i don't think they would accept me saying to them: 'the next 10 days we will not eat, pay the rent, use the phone, run the car, etcetera etcetera, because i need a new computer to play a game'. i would not even want to.i bought my first computer from the money i made on my first day job in 1982. when where you born?on topic: please put the ability to choose medium settings back in to the game. pretty please?"
1/24/2010,"no you nob, the sound engine is rubbish and has no 'medium' setting to remove, try picking an excellent part of the game. now lets imagine everything else in the game (including the graphics) being made just as excellent.i just switched my client to 'low setting' and i'm not sure whats wrong with yours but i could still see graphics. maybe you should redownload yours and check again, if you still cant see any graphics then i suggest petitioning ccp.so you just prefere running your client on 'medium' purely for aesthetics or what? well i'd prefere to run my client at a setting higher than 'high settings' for exactly that reason but alas i cant. so remind me again why people who can play the game on 'low' but prefered 'medium' shoud be listened to again?why is this such a standard response when people talk about upgrading? if you're unable to keep up with the times financially then what can i say? everybodies circumstances are different ffs. stop playing eve so much and think of a way to save 20 bucks a week, speak to the wife, boss whoever, stop drinking/going out, cut down on something/anything, its really not that much. in 5 weeks check your savings and rethink the situation.barring all that, then i'd suggest just playing on 'low' and deal with it.in any case, we've established that your pc can run eve on 'low' so therefore you can still play the game and dont need me to buy one for you. if ccp had removed 'low' and you couldnt play it would be different. but i'd still tell you to upgrade if you wanna play, if you couldnt, then maybe this isnt the hobby for you?i hope ccp put the work they were doing on 'medium' into developing a dx11 codepath and a future graphics upgrade. sorry if that bothers a few of you, but you'll just have to change your settings down for the time being. i'd also suggest a few of you should start saving. edit: can i just add that those aggrieved by the fact the change was swept in unannounced are perfectly in their rights to be so. now that is something i dont agree with, the change itself is one thing but the introduction (or removal in this case) without any correspondance was unnecessary."

1/24/2010,"in my opinion, the csm is not taken serious by ccp.while some issues which have been raised through the csm have been resolved and of course ccp can't fix everything within a week, i still think too much issues are not being looked at.especially the issues sent after the meeting in iceland are not taken very serious, often only getting a line or two as reply, such as ""its being added to the backlog"" and ""we're aware of this issue"", after which we never hear from it again for another year.csm2 has proposed a q&a session where the csm could submit questions on behalf of the players. ccp hasn't been answering these either. minutes take forever to approve and be published. communication is one way, and i feel ccp isn't keeping up their end of the bargain and do not make use of all the work the csm does for them.profilation and interest in the csm is at a low since the last elections, and ccp still hasn't come up with any plan to improve on the csm system. by the time they finally have something working, a lot of good people aren't egible to run again, which is a shame. the current csm needs to discuss this with ccp and look for solutions, both for their own sake and that of the players."

1/24/2010,"i came about this idea, because everyone seems to be can-fishing for fights in high sec by the stations. so i thought, people want pvp 1:1 and not always the blob fights in 0.0, lets find a way to improve this part of eve.let me introduce the arena, home of the gladiators!dock at your station an open the arena contract window. in the arena you accept a contract on a fight and warp to the designated space just as you would in a mission. only you and your apponent is allowed in with fighting ships, others can join in shuttles if they want (normal concord rules apply to them)the contract you found for the arena fight can contain any number of rules you agree to, and you might also place a sum of isk on the outcome as a bet. the rules could for example be ""only cruiser class ships"" ""2 million isk wager on outcome"" 1:1 fight ( or 2:2, 5:5 ...the sky is the limit)in basic language my idea is to make ""station fighting"" a game feature by makeing a clever match making system. if used to set up tournaments, the winner could be awared a medal, ie. ""winner of 2010 1000 player tournament""what do u all think?"

1/24/2010,"they're not nebulae, they're the excrement left behind by the eve space dragon."
1/24/2010,"disclaimer: this is not a completely original idea, and people have made suggestions about changes to the way mission and rat loot is handled elsewhere, but i haven't seen this exact suggestion made previously. if it has been already proposed and rejected (or indeed approved), apologies for the wasted pixels.---------------under the current system, there is a massive quantity of npc-dropped modules introduced to the game through mission running, exploration, and ratting.this has 2 effects (well, it has a whole bunch of effects but these are the two i'm looking at):1) npc loot drops remove demand for player-manufactured modules by supplying modules out of thin air and so removes opportunities for start-up t1 manufacturers to enter the already-saturated module market.2) loot drops also provide an easy source of refineable items and so flood the t1 mineral market, devaluing and disencentivising mining in favour of mission running or ratting. (i recently saw a figure quoted that 40% of the mineral market was provided by melted down rat loot, but i'm not sure how accurate that is). it seems illogical that nearly as many minerals are generated through a by-product of ratting or missioning, as are bought in by mining.so i propose the following:replace meta level 1-4 rat loot with 'broken components' to 'reverse engineer' into functioning meta 1-4 modules. for example, where in the current system an npc might drop an arbalest cruise missile launcher module when destroyed, it would now drop a 'broken arbalest cruise missile launcher components' item in the wreck instead. the broken components item would be used in a reverse engineering job to convert a standard t1 module into the corresponding meta level 1-4 module.the 'reverse engineering' job would be a simple manufacturing job - no datacores, no t1 or t2 materials, no chance of failure, you feed 10 t1 cruise launchers and 10 'arbalest cruise launcher broken components' into an open factory slot, and 10 arbalest cruise launcher modules pop out at the other end. in effect, the 'broken component' item would act broadly similarly to how a bpc for a faction item or ship is currently used, except that multiple components could be put into the same manufacturing job to manufacture multiple modules.***i know the term 'reverse engineering' is already taken but it was the most accurate term i could come up with for this process, i appreciate that re-using the term may cause confusion so if anyone can think of a better name please say and if i like it i'll edit it in***(continued)"
1/24/2010,"effects:1) vastly increases demand for basic t1 modules since npc loot now is reliant on a supply of them to construct the finished meta 1-4 products. this should open up the manufacturing profession to more people if a more viable market for t1 products comes into existence.2) as well as stimulating t1 production, reverse engineering of named modules might provide a stepping stone towards t2 manufacturing.3) a t1 mineral source is converted into a mineral sink, because not only is the flooding of the market with melted down rat loot for minerals no longer an issue, but instead rat loot consumes minerals produced through mining. mining becomes a more viable profession since it is no longer competing with a mineral source appearing out of thin air, particularly for lowsec and 0.0 mining (because rat loot no longer generates vast quantities of highends).4) may be a slight stealth nerf to mission runners since the loot they gather would be no longer useful by itself until engineered into finished modules. however i believe this would be a minor issue, since its likely that mission runners would simply sell on the broken components to manufacturers rather than selling the finished modules, or perhaps begin reverse engineering the meta 1-4 modules themselves or co-operating with manufacturing-orientated corpmates or other contacts.5) prices of named modules may rise slightly to maintain the existing isk/effort ratio, and availability of undesirable modules may be reduced (looking at the vast amount of 'junk' modules selling for nearly nothing in the highsec hubs, this is not necessarily a bad thing). possible additions:*possible idea: require the bpo for the t1 module as well?*possible idea: require salvager modules to retrieve the broken components from wrecks, rather than them dropping into the wreck as at present?*possible idea: reverse engineering restricted to lowsec stations only (since in many cases it would be using technology created by criminal pirates, or obtained through shooting ded patrols, there's a certain logic to this, and a genuine reason for lowsec to exist would be welcome)? *possible idea: expand process to include meta 6+ faction/deadspace/officer modules too? perhaps requiring a t2 module to construct the finished module? this would be more for the sake of consistency than anything else*possible idea: expand process to include all modules, including 'pvp loot' from destroyed player ships?*possible idea: require new low level skillbooks that would unlock the ability to carry out these reverse engineering jobs?criticisms? further suggestions? unintended consequences?"
1/24/2010,the stealth nerf for missions might not be as stealh as you think.many people reprocess loot and build ammo from it. especially in areas with high prices (lowsec/nullsec). you would cut them from their mineral supply.bringing down an ammo bpo/a few bpcs is much easier to bring the same amount of ammo down.edit: for the rest i need to think more about it.
1/24/2010,"why people that have this kind of ideas never think what are the real effects and instead list the effect they wish for?effects:1) vastly increases demand for basic t1 modules since npc loot now is reliant on a supply of them to construct the finished meta 1-4 products. this should open up the manufacturing profession to more people if a more viable market for t1 products comes into existence.no, vastly increase in building slots demand, something that is harmful so long as ccp don't change pos so that you can rent building slots outside your corporations. 2) as well as stimulating t1 production, reverse engineering of named modules might provide a stepping stone towards t2 manufacturing.nothing to do with t2 production, so why it should stimulate something?3) a t1 mineral source is converted into a mineral sink,and a material faucet is removed, unbalancing the mission rewards toward isk creation (there is no need for isk rewards to be increased for that to happen, if you remove 20-30% of the reward in loot you instantly increase the % of the reward made up from isk). 4) may be a slight stealth nerf to mission runners since the loot they gather would be no longer useful by itself until engineered into finished modules. however i believe this would be a minor issue, since its likely that mission runners would simply sell on the broken components to manufacturers rather than selling the finished modules, or perhaps begin reverse engineering the meta 1-4 modules themselves or co-operating with manufacturing-orientated corpmates or other contacts.it would instantly double the market entries for meta modules adding ""broken meta module"" for each one of them (bad for the database); it would require major changes in the module production (currently no module can have 2 different set components to build them, after your change it would have a ""constructed with mineral"" version and a ""constructed with t1+broken meta"" version), that alone would make it a huge no no for ccp; naturally it should apply to belt rat too, right? (you haven't thought about that apparently). so you think that 0.0 alliance (yours included) would be happy to have station and pos building slots clogged by module production?most mission runner would not spend the time looting broken bits and so you would get more people running for bounties and lp only, not a good thing."
1/24/2010,"5) prices of named modules may rise slightly to maintain the existing isk/effort ratio, and availability of undesirable modules may be reduced. prices of named module would rise significantly as less people would loot. ""undesirable"" modules are used in invention. possible additions:*possible idea: require the bpo for the t1 module as well?even more market entries, almost x5 the current number of modules bpo*possible idea: require salvager modules to retrieve the broken components from wrecks, rather than them dropping into the wreck as at present?even less people looting.*possible idea: reverse engineering restricted to lowsec stations only ? even more awful. *possible idea: expand process to include meta 6+ faction/deadspace/officer modules too? perhaps requiring a t2 module to construct the finished module? this would be more for the sake of consistency than anything elsei suppose your alliance mates would like it a lot . but if this is ever implemented it is a must. *possible idea: expand process to include all modules, including 'pvp loot' from destroyed player ships?but if this is ever implemented it is a must. *possible idea: require new low level skillbooks that would unlock the ability to carry out these reverse engineering jobs?reduce even more the number of young industrialist. good for me ."
1/24/2010,"you're right, it would mean more competition for factory slots, but perhaps that would give highsec manufacturers a valid reason to join a dedicated industry corp and use their manufacturing poss so they could avoid those queues? (heaven forbid there should be any incentive in this game to leave state war academy)out of interest, since i don't spend much time in empire, are the manufacturing slots in lowsec stations largely unused, or are they as busy as the highsec ones?ok, maybe it wouldn't, but all i meant was that it would be something 'in between' the two.not sure why this is a bad thing, i'd guess the typical mission runner doesn't much care what percentage of their income comes through what source, just how much income they're getting. and honestly, if people are running missions to get minerals rather than mining for them, doesn't that suggest an imbalance between the professions that should be addressed?um, no it wouldn't. after this change, all meta-loot would be ""constructed with t1+broken meta"". i'm not sure where you get the idea that there would be a ""constructed with minerals"" option for meta-loot, apologies if i've phrased something badly to create that impression. of course, there would still by 'legacy' meta-loot on the market which was dropped by rats before the change, but the database doesn't need to distinguish between the two, any more than it needs to distinguish today between t2 modules constructed through invention and those constructed with legacy t2 bpos. naturally (as well as plex and anomaly loot).(continues)"
1/24/2010,"as it happens most of our factory slots are lying empty right now from what i've seen, so yes i'd be glad to see them getting used. if it causes a problem for alliance business, there are ways around it, for a start the option to restrict outpost factory slots to certain types of production, have the alliance members set up manufacturing poss, or have the alliance set up export facilities to buy the broken loot from their members and sell it in empire. i can't speak for other alliances but i know we do all of those things already. 0.0 alliances can be creative types when they need to be.i'm glad you're such a fan of goonswarm that you're worried about any change that adversely affects us, but i've not proposed this as some self-serving plot to make our lives easier. sorry if i'm not living up to the conspiracy theories.why wouldn't they? why would a mission runner today spend the time looting the intact module to sell to a shopper, but turn his nose up at the broken component that he could sell to a manufacturer? a meta-3 or 4 broken component for a popular item is still going to be worth a significant amount.surely if prices rise, there's more incentive for people to loot those suddenly more valuable items?i meant the existing bpo for the t1 module, not a new 'meta-bpo'.less people looting = less supply to meet existing demand = price rise = looting becomes more worthwhile? any particular reason? who dares wins, and lowsec needs something to justify its existence, although i realise this particular option would deter the more timid highsec residents. like i said, i'm not suggesting this for goonswarm's benefit.i realise eve isn't intended to be particularly 'realistic', but its always seemed odd that i can blow a hostile ship to pieces and have intact usable modules fall out of the wreck with no repair work required on them at all.i don't think requiring 10 minutes of training a rank 1 skill to unlock the ability is going to significantly hamper a new industrialist.thanks for your replies so far."
1/24/2010,"i see you haven't noticed the difference between material faucet and mineral faucet. people run mission to get loot. they don't do them specifically for minerals, especially as you don't get the minerals you need but instead the mineral that can be produced reprocessing loot.loot has plenty of forms.removing loot (or making it mostly useless) reduce looting and increase the relative injection of isk in the system. if massive inflation isn't a negative effect for you it for most people. reprocessing a item require a ""constructed with minerals"" option to work and is one of the reason why some dev said that making something similar to your proposal would require a lot of work for the development team. search in the features and ideas forum for the quote, it was about 1 year ago."
1/24/2010,"every step you add on the road to convert a item into isk or something useful reduce the number of people willing to do it. i think it would reduce the number of people looting, but it is an opinion.not really, most of the price increase would be soaked by resellers.the mission runner would sell the items at a lower price than the old operative module, resellers would buy then en masse, rebuild teens or hundreds of them in one operation, and then sell them soaking up the difference. very few mission runners would spend the time rebuilding 2-3 modules at a time to sell then at full price. probably the same people that currently is buying modules at less than mineral price would buy broken modules for rebuilding and reselling. even less mission runners interested in rebuilding the modules, but at least there will not be a proliferation of bpo.time sink, less interesting than running another mission.that wasn't the meaning of my comment, sorry if i offended you. the comment meant that most ratters in 0.0 would hate it. i agree. it not the 1 skill requiring 10 minutes for the first rank that weight on young players, it is the cumulative effect of teen of needed skills at level 1 (and more to be really effective). from a point of view i like the idea of more complex manufacturing and even of a change in the loot from missions. my problem is that eve is a strongly integrated and touching something as sensitive as the industrial part can create big unintended after effects."
1/24/2010,"my impression has always been that people run missions to get isk, whether the isk comes from rewards or bounties or selling on valuable meta-4 loot or melting down junk loot and selling the minerals or accumulating loyalty points to spend in the store on faction items to sell on... aren't those just the means to the end? i mean, if you really really need a 1600mm rolled tungsten plate and one happens to drop in your mission, that's great, but if something equally valuable drops that you could sell and then use the isk to buy a 1600mm tungsten plate from the market, apart from maybe running to the nearest market hub, isn't the end result much the same?but the loot isn't 'mostly useless', the broken components are still worth salvaging since they're needed to construct meta 1-4 mods.good luck trying to find anything with the search facilities on this forum!wait... how does meta-loot get melted down under the current system then? there's no ability for us to construct it using minerals now, so what would this change?"
1/24/2010,"perhaps, but i feel any reduction would be marginal. components for popular items are still going to be valuable and worth collecting. junk components will be left in space to rot just like junk modules are left to rot currently.hang on, if they're mass producing meta-mods then they're not 'resellers', they're manufacturers!is any aspect of mission running 'interesting'??? check my corp ticker again, it's pretty difficult to make a comment i'd be offended by :)again, i think most 0.0 ratters would barely notice the difference except that they'd be selling their valuable meta-loot to a manufacturing corpmate rather than a fellow ratter or empire exporter. it would probably increase industrial activity in our space though.fair enough, although the amount of skills required would obviously depend on the system, but the existing manufacturer skills could probably cover it and there's no real reason to add more."
1/24/2010,"why so complicated with re and then production and adding some more items into the database. the rats might aswell just drop bpc's with no skill requirements, meta0 module and like 2trit+1 pyerite as mat requirements."
1/24/2010,"like i said, in mechanics terms the broken components would act similarly to a bpc, the only problem with using them is that you can't 'merge' bpcs so every module would have to be constructed as an individual manufacturing job which seems needlessly time consuming."
1/24/2010,not a terrible idea. i think it's at least worth discussion.

1/24/2010,"i think his point is that it should be drone damage mods. moving them to the highslot is inconsistant with other weapon systems and smacks of ""i want my domi's ogre iis to do hilarious amounts of damage, and i want all my lowslots stuffed with armour tank without compromising to fit damage mods there like everyone else does""."

1/25/2010,"i have supported this but does need more refining and discussion.i love the black market idea but i think more content would need to be developed for this to really work.i want to discuss missions as i think there is an imbalance with low-sec rewards for standard missions. the people who aren't newbies that do mission in low-sec do it either for the challenge/something different or because they are pirates and don't have access to high sec.i think currently the system is very skewed towards the hunter/attacker and while balancing this doesn't mean i want more carebears in low-sec. it means more corps would be willing to setup in low-sec for better rewards and protect their area which in turn should result in more territorial fights.issues with the current balance. - only the lp increases for doing low-sec missions this is only around 1/3 of the rewards. - scanning out mission runners (in low sec) is too easy now. - salvaging/looting is a big component of rewards and you are very much a sitting duck again especially if you hand the mission in so its not dead space (probe your exact position not just the first gate). - bounties in missions don't change for being in low-sec - possibility of being camped in station or blocked from missions if too many pirates always passing through.now not all of these need fixing as such but they do add up to mean that low-sec missions just return such a crap reward for the risks and possible denial to run them.with better rewards it would make corps/groups move out there and fight for their mission spots. currently the rewards are so bad high sec corps wouldn't even try. this may sound like getting bears in low-sec but to me a bear won't come out even with high rewards, these corps are the ones who skip low-sec as even a viable option and go straight out to 0.0 for the riches out there.i really do like the idea of corps of all kinds being able to live in low-sec and live off the area instead of relying on alts for isk. yes yes some pirates are very successful but this does seem very dependent on timezone and low-sec in my tz (+10) can be fairly quiet.i think another easy way to boost low-sec is with loot/salvage. make the drop dynamic depending on if its >= .5 or < .5 with more higher meta loot and more salvage. wormholes were a good proof that some high-sec players (not care bears) will go to where the profits are, people die in wh's but a lot still do it because the rewards are great enough to factor in a loss every now and then.gcc timer - i think this should be a bit more dynamic, say in .1 its only 5mins and scales up to 15mins at .4 space. though even i feel 15mins is too much sometimes, if your in a small ship you are very limited in what you can do and most of the time i dock up or cloak while i wait out the timer. it seems a waste of time when you only have 1-2 hours to play.one thing i don't want happening in low-sec is buying protection from gate guns so they don't shoot you with gcc. (stations guns i'm not sure on yet)"

1/25/2010,"i do support this, although i have little to do with this ,it seems unfair to me. although, ccp should be the first one to care about it."
1/25/2010,"when i spent a summer contemplating putting my account on hold for rl financial reasons i asked in some channels about this. the answer i remember most clearly was ""i hate it when people answer this question. it just competes with my own datacore prices.""that tells me right there that someone likes abusing this and doesn't want it to be a commonplace thing. i have no idea how prevalent a practice it is. but a stable of latent characters should be just that: latent. if this change causes someone to not want to use their research alts anymore, they are still able to be sold for a boost to isk just like any other account. the isk they have already generated since 2003 has paid out billions to those who've been around. just my own active account has made close to a billion isk in datacore sales in two years.passive income is nice. but this is beyond passive. this is comatose. i don't understand why ccp didn't stop rp production the same as sp accumulation in inactive accounts. and i do believe that market orders and contracts should be affected as well. but this certainly needs addressed."
1/25/2010,"i am liking the ideas i am reading, and i think putting some together would be good too.putting the sov units outside the system but ""joining"" them together with a repair effect.all sov units must be under attack in amount greater then their tanks can hold, if not they will repair each other an thus make them all unbreakable below 50% total hp, until the last units are being hit. if a sov unit is under attack and it has friendly units in the area they are unbreakable below 75%. but the friendly force has to equal lets say 25-50% of the attacking forces numbers.this will cause both attackers and defenders to split their forces at make choices on the battlefield it will also limit mobility in itself because removing ships could cause the ratio to change and toss all systems into a situation that owuld repair the sov. units.feel free to play wiht he numbers as i am just tossing them out there. but that would remove the need for blobs, but this would also require lowering the hp of targets as their would e a limited number of ships that could be use to fire on them in all situation.how does that sound?"

1/25/2010,"you know the only problem i have with all of this is the ""smoke trails"" that everyone is talking about all over this thread.i don't think there is any ""smoke"" in space. even on engines like what the space shuttle uses, in space what is being burned is a perfect combination of fuels, it doesn't leave any remains behind like smoke, just the molecules created after the interaction of the two fuel parts. kind of like how hydrogen and oxygen when combined won't leave smoke behind, just the h2o molecules created by the combination. although on earth the intense heat could burn other molecules and leave a bit of smoke behind.anyway anything that ""leaves a smoke trail"" isn't supported by me. same with giant ""explosions"", they just wouldn't be that big in space unless it was the fuel source exploding, in which case it could be very big depending on that fuel source rather than the ship size. for instance it is completly possible that an interceptor with a mwd would create a bigger boom than a battleship. if the engine doesn't go, which it shouldn't always explode then the explosion would be limited by the oxygen in the ship. in fact most ships would simply vent the atmosphere or fracture apart with very small explosions if any, it all depends on how it was destroyed.basically i would rather see things be realistic instead of shiny and graphics intense."

1/25/2010,"whatever happened to ccp fear, and his statement in dev blog of 2008.08.06 that 'removal of insurance in concord events will be implemented in the near future'. if ccp were planning to make this change, why did they change their minds - is there a link to comments from anyone in ccp? i couldn't find any."
1/25/2010,"it was explained at length and in detail to fear why that would be a very bad idea, and the proposal was put in a bag and drowned, as it deserved to be.insurance is irrelevant to small ships being used for ganking. losing ~10% of the price of a battleship will make casual bs ganks uneconomic. but you if you remove insurance altogether, then you have undesirable effects like making npc corp freighters, orcas, etc, effectively invulnerable. you have to remember that suicide ganking isn't wrong. it's not cheating or undesirable or unintended or exploiting or griefing, and while it arguably needs rebalancing, it doesn't need eliminating."
1/25/2010,i agree with the idea that insurance premiums should fluctuate with average mineral prices on a regular adjustment schedule (every 7 days or month) is really the way it should go. fixed prices just doesn't make sense when everything else in the economy fluctuates with supply and demand.i do also think that payouts from being concorded or self-destructing should be reduced (to half) or completely eliminated. it makes absolutely no sense that either situation would grant full insurance payout.
1/25/2010,"once insurance payouts are lower than mineral value, self-destructing will pretty much stop, since it will always be better to reprocess the ship for minerals. as for ""making sense"", coherency takes a back seat to game balance. if you're going to eliminate insurance for concorded ships in the name of ""good sense"", then fair enough. but we will have to abandon the idea of concord of being omnipotent, invincible and omniscient and working for free, since that doesn't make any sense either. if concord beome falliable, unreliable and escapable, then i have no problem with removing insurance for concord kills.in any case, i dont want this thread to become about suicide ganking. there have been more than enough discussions about that. this one is about reforming the way insurance is calculated."
1/25/2010,"supported!!! it is done for corp hangars - really - why hasn't this already been implemented for personal hangars? :) also - change it from 7 tabs to at least 8 and so you don't even have to use all 8 but at least give option to players. if they want one they get one, if they want 8 tabs, they get 8 etc etc. change this for corp hangars as well. that way players in corp can each get a tab that can be locked out from other players in corp permissions.getting back to the thread though, for the personal hangar tabs, make it local client cacheable so the server doesn't have to remember it and then it is just a matter of a coding change and not a resource hog. great idea.lets make it happen!"
1/25/2010,"i support improving the organization of assets. especially by allowing the assets search function to include items stored in station containers.but => i recognize that this will add significantly to the database that is being searched. currently i have 10 mission hubs each with 5 station containers full of an average of 200 different items. if my search function is going to have to include these various meta/commodity/refinable/etc. items it could add additional latency to the assets & search menu. instead of searching a list of 50 items it will be searching a list of 10,000 items.could we allow items inside station containers to be repackaged directly instead of having to be dragged to the items menu first?this would reduce the number of items in my mission fittings station container and make fitting slightly easier."
1/25/2010,"only problem i can see is people grinding out slaves to make isk, aka fly to one port and turn slaves into free people make a little isk, take all the free people to another station and turn them into slaves, make a little isk. sooner or later you could see freighter loads of slaves being moved around... then again maybe this would be a little more realistic than the hold ornaments they are at the moment."
1/25/2010,i propose that ccp go back and add a ship crew amount to the show info on ships. i know some maybe thinking its a pod no crew but if you look you will find a live stock item: ship's crew. show info for it is: a non-capsuleer member of a ships crew relegated to manual tasks essential for maintaining the operational status of the ship. so ships have people besides you on them and personally i would like to know just how many people die when i lose a ship or blow up someone elses.

1/25/2010,"several years ago miners and mission runners were complaining about jet can thieves and wanted to introduce some sort of flagging to combat the problem.they got it.how often to mission runners and miners fire on can flippers/loot thieves. not very often. why? because they usually come back in bigger ships. you mission runners really don't know what's good for you. in your mind... 'noob' comes along and steals your salvage, flagging himself, you one volley him with your golem and go for a self congratulatory dance with madam palm and her five lovely daughters.in reality... 'noob' flags himself, you either one volley him or force him to warp out, what the hell, it's only a destroyer. he returns in a battlecruiser+ sized ship, maybe with logistics backup, maybe not to come and ruin your day. he does so and takes your loot and your tears.just accept that your loot can't be touched and enjoy the fact that you're still making more from bounties, rewards, loot and lp in a single mission than he will in an evening."

1/25/2010,"i only was interrupted once, to see the salvager killed by the rats. yet, that is not the point. i believe that since i created the loot and the wreck, they both belong to me, and someone taking it deserves to die if he cannot not defend himself. another reason for this is that ninja salvaging is the most risk free profession in the whole of eve after maybe sitting in station all day and manufacturing."

1/25/2010,"so if you can kill them, it's not risk free, so what you talk about? if you are able to shoot them only when they do something wrong, this is the same case as mission runner died in mission. it is impossible to die if you don't do something wrong. if you talk about risk, what about missions? we know that ppl buy a new golem every week right? also learn to play damn game, if you wont be probbed don't use a ships which signature is big as a star (tengu). or put a eccm on the ship. seriously, where the heck do you read that eve is a realistic game?! class of ships is borked, guns mechanics is bul**** aka orbiting stopped ship, warping is nothing like real world laws (your ship is a giant ball for the code, and so on..."
1/25/2010,"how can it be ""risk free"" if you've ""killed multiple"" of them?"
1/25/2010,"very well, since the salvage already exists, please point at the part of the wreck that is the melted capacitor console prior to you using the salvage module on it.i'll wait.btw, if i crash my car, it still belongs to me, because the law says so. if you wreck a ship at sea it belongs to whomever finds it and recovers the wreckage, once again, because the law says so. (by your logic, the wreck should belong to the captain.)which real life example do you suppose is more apt here?and while we're on the subject, you salvaging the windshield of my wrecked car doesn't make the rest of the wreck suddenly vanish - oh that's right, this is a game. i keep forgetting that."
1/25/2010,"bla bla, we've got one camp calling it intended game mechanics on the one side, and another camp calling it stupid game mechanics on the other side.as ccp is unlikely to change said game mechanics (for that, these kinds of threads have been way too numerous) why not make the distinction clear once and for all? after all, the mechanics are in place to do so already:- make the wrecks spawn empty, blue ('abandoned'/ free-for-all)- make the loot spawn as a can, owned by the missionrunner / ratterthere, no more discussion, it's painfully obvious what is whose. end of discussion.this will however, spawn more objects in space. i know a node craps out at about a 1000 pvpers in 1 0.0 system, i don't know how busy for instance motsu's node is, so i'm not the one to judge if this will cripple the node."

1/25/2010,thanks paul the wise that would be a dream solution as the mos i see in the systems i use is 250/300 often much less than that.and seen as this is not a 0.0 issue then there should be no problem with this solution.thanks for the imput.
1/25/2010,"macro miners ""helping"" the economy is just plain ignorant and probably the voice of a macro user. macro mining needs to stop because not everyone starts out in 0.0 space. they need to flag miners who warp back and forth to bookmarks for hours. no miner will continually travel back and forth for hours on end. the macros have changed to fly under the radar by setting bookmarks in different belts. this breaks up their travel giving the appearance of someone going to a new belt. belt rats with more jamming devices would just slow them down. i made a point to mine roids macros were hitting. as soon as the roids disappeared, they were hitting other roids.there are taletell signs of a macro, but ccp will not end macro mining since they are constantly fixing new features they bring out. macros are in pretty much every system in high sec and ccp has no interest in stopping them. otherwise they would. i recently came back to the game after quitting in hopes they would stop cheating or take an interest in it and attempt to slow it down. the only way ccp will take interest in it is if it or goons take an interest in it. we know it is dev ran, so if macro mining is to stop, goons will need to employ it. the only time ccp takes real interest in anything is if goons are doing it, everyone knows that."

1/25/2010,"this is true however you lose your ship , it has nothing to do with smartbombing.you made a mistake and you paid for it, just like any other type of combat in eve.your option to fight back start when you select your warp in range.warp to 0 comes with a risk attached if your in a ship that cant withstand a disco bs.you can 100% remove this risk by not warping to 0 in a line from another gate.you need to recognise the point at which possible pvp encounters starts.this point is the range you decide to warp in at. it is the same for any other type of pvp , come in at a favourable range you may win , come in at a bad range you may lose.i'd have to say no.smartbombing has allready been nerfed, it used to be possible to bomb at a gate/station at zero.smartbombing can not now be performed within a range that will hit the station/gate.this means its impossible to smartbomb at the point where your ship is out of warp, smartbombs at a gate station can only hit you whilst your passing through the aoe in the last moments of warp.and btw if your grid is not loading whilst your coming out of warp to a gate then you need a faster modem."
1/25/2010,i guess someone hasn't fought in 0.0...ex lowsec smartbomber here. not supported. what you are proposing would make lowsec perfectly safe for shuttles and fast frigs when this 'problem' is only limited to three or four high traffic lowsec pipes. it's very simple to avoid smartbomb camps. it's also pretty easy to tank up a frig to be able to take a volley of bombs.
1/25/2010,"i agree, ships that are still warping shouldn't take damage.edit: i just read larkonis's reply and now i don't know.i am entirely against unbeatable ships, people or strategies that are always riskless.but at the same time, i think that ships shouldn't be dying in warp.also, i hate that tactic (sitting 5k off a gate in a smartbombing bs with warp core stabs fitted) so much that my opinion is biased. i mean... cmon.. go find real targets or go play wow. yeah... i don't know"
1/25/2010,"i've done plenty of 0.0 and low sec pvp. i'm not asking for smartbombs to be nerfed either.i would like to see a fix to where a ship can not be blown up while in warp.when you first enter warp, your ship stops taking damage and as such, when coming out of warp your ship should still not take damage until the warp drive turns off.perhaps make it to where stargates or not targetable so that one would have to fire a smartbomb at another pilot in order for that tactic to work. i'm all for pvp, but i'm not for losing a ship while in warp."

1/25/2010,i'd like to propose that all threads which have been voted on by the csm be colored. same way threads with posts by mods or devs are colored.one color for passed and another for not passed. this would save alot of reading time for those of us interested in the proposals raised in this forum.
1/25/2010,supported.
1/25/2010,can also read the minutes if you are curious about how the discussion went.
1/25/2010,"supported, but both supports and unsupported should be shown in thread overview. (post count, supports, unsupports)"
1/25/2010,"imo, this is kind of redundant. by default, everyone on the forums is ""not supporting"" a proposal. because it takes an active step to select the ""support"" button, it would make more sense to just start every proposal off with ~400,000 non-supports--one for every active account.issues that are highly contested generally spawn longer threads filled with debate from both sides. i trust the csm's judgment to navigate those and understand enough to formulate a respectable position on the issue. in the case of proposals with almost no support--generally opposed by the overall ah community--the op usually disappears shortly after the first page and the thread dies not long after."
1/25/2010,this proposal has been brought up a few times and is part of the package of improvements to the assembly hall forum tools.
1/25/2010,"i like the idea. have both supported and not-supported options. make them a bit more prominent than the current checkbox. and have the tally of each (or a +/- value) displayed on the op.supported.for that matter, please disable the ""support"" (and if added ""not support"") options when replying to a thread you've already voted on. it's very annoying as it is now that you don't know unless you scan through all the posts for your name, and if you try to reply with support to an already supported thread it trips the 5 minute posting timer."
1/25/2010,"this is true, and holds true to the storyline of eve and news reports, ore needs to respond to the demands of the capsuleers, maybe even a new ship like a suped up retriever, but that has a massive tank, but only 2 strips, smaller hold than a hulk, but like i said major tanking ability."
1/25/2010,i think the premise is sound. any large mining vessel would by neccessity require a massive hull and as a civilian vessel have little armor and shielding.
1/25/2010,"a badly made pic of what i mean.please visit your user settings to re-enable images.edit:sorry for nutty size, too used to high res."
1/25/2010,this sounds like a great idea. not only is it helpful like mentioned but i also think eve's ship interface (what we spend 100% of our time looking at pretty much)is pretty much underpowered and for lack of a better term kind of lame. in other words it is not as realistic as a spaceship would be. a few extra gauges is what one would imagine would be present to a pilot. now obviously the game doesn't call for much and one does not want to overclutter the screne as the overview does a great job but just adding something more like velocity/momentum etc like this would class it up a bit and add some realism imho.
1/25/2010,"tougher rats means more valuable rats and more of a challange, currently they are no match even for a lvl 3 mission. more rats-> more chalange-> more fun + more much needed null-sec iskcurrently they are no challnage for anyone who once did a lvl 3 mission."

1/25/2010,"the issuance of a rookie ship is a stopgap from a player losing all of his game possesions and isk and thus making it impossible to recover from the loss of a ship. the rookie ship always gives the player the ability to kill the easiest of npcs in a rookie ship and progress in the game, however slowly. however for msot players the rookie ship is an annoyance that causes mroe problems than it solvesi have several hundred lose rookie ships and bits of tritanium floating around in random stations i will never visit. not because i lost a ship and needed it, but because i decided to fly to a station in my pod. these items only clutter up the assets tab, and most importantly, causes undue database load on the server there should be an option on the esc menu to opt-out of being given a new rookie ship, and the ability to opt back in at any timethis could also apply to the annoying scc mails every time i dock in a pod, although the new mail system males it easy to delete them all easily.what does everyone think? is this just an annoyance for me or do others have the same issues?"
1/25/2010,right click -> trashproblem solved.
1/25/2010,"this is the reason i never even consider clicking the ""assets"" tab now."
1/25/2010,"it's pretty annoying, but trashing it every time you dock in a pod isnt really that big a burden."
1/25/2010,"yup.think about the extra process that happens on the server when they ahve to prompt you if you want. i can tell you that when i'm getting my ass kicked and i'm spamming the omfgdocknownownownow!!!! button, i don't wanna deal with more process."
1/25/2010,open mail > notifications > delete allits fairly annoying and would be nice to disable. not terribly high priority.
1/25/2010,"i have noticed quite a few times that players get into heated arguments and would like to fight, but both parties are worried about taking the first shot and being concorded. consider the idea of issuing duelling permits as a way for dealing with this situation. a player would have the option of selecting a notification for a duel to send to the other player. if this offer is accepted both parties would make payments of one million isk each to concord to resolve their differences. this would add another dimension to the game.how about some commission on the idea? lol"

1/25/2010,"lets say you have a group of probes out all set to 8au scan range.you do you scan and find the signature your after.you drop the range on all probes down to 4/2au.problem ( the bubbles on your probes no longer overlap )so each probe has to be moved inward to make the probes overlap.my proposal is this.when you grab the edge of a bubble and shift drag it to resize all probes, the probes should move inwards / outwards towards there common center to maintain the amount of overlap you have set.this way as you change range on probes you only have to reposition the group , rather than constantly having to reposition each probe manually."
1/25/2010,from what i remember this was on the agenda for dominion but was dropped. so i would expect we will see something like this in the future.
1/25/2010,i am against making scanning too easy. i dislike this proposal.
1/25/2010,"not easier , just less fiddly."
1/25/2010,agreed.it takes skill and practice to learn to group probes correctly around the signal as you narrow it down to a lock. this is what makes scanning fun.

1/25/2010,now that would be cool :d
1/25/2010,"buhu. i do believe the op is refering to conquerable stations and outposts, many of which probably contain countless billions worth of stuff left by previous owners. if there is a way of working around the problems this causes and the means of destroying a 0.0 outpost are made sufficiently time and resource intensive (maybe requiring a couple of titans on grid chargin their lazors for an hour or two when the station exits it's last rf timer).while people may be concerned about supercap proliferation i, for one, am more bothered about outpost proliferation."
1/25/2010,this is really needed :)make it happen.
1/25/2010,that would be even worse because everyone and their mother would just flock in curse/fountain and whatever else npc stations there are in 0.0. those should be destructible just as well if you go this route.
1/25/2010,"are you retired?if you keep more than a bil's worth of stuff in a conquerable station at the moment then you're being pretty foolish. given that npc space would fill up pretty quick and running logistics to the deeper regions for moons and stuff would be somewhat difficult people would still use outposts.as i said, as long as it was made time and resource intensive enough to destroy or ruin an outpost there's not going to be a problem."
1/25/2010,"blowing up the largest man-made objects that exist in eve??? sure! make them only destroyable by doomsdays justified by ""unbelievably resilient and self-repairing superstructure nearly impossible to destroy"" ps: give us deathstars, i want to blow up someone's disposium moon as well!"

1/25/2010,"it makes sense that outposts and pos should be destructible. not saying it should be by any means easy, but it certainly should be possible given enough time and resources.supported."
1/25/2010,"ccp could implement it so that once the station is ""destroyed"" it no longer becomes possible to dock, and all jump clones are destroyed. then once the next downtime comes around, the station is removed and replaced with a ""station wreck"". the wreck would be permanent, and anyone who had items/ships in the station could eject them from the station. also, anyone in the station when it is converted to a wreck, would still be able to undock, but they would get a warning that says that they will not be able to dock back up.edited for support"
1/25/2010,"as much as i'd love to see this it will not happen at least for now. ccp has already stated that it was their original intention to make outposts destructible but the main coding problem that kept them from realizing this feature was what would happen to all the pilots logged out at said station once it blew up. as far as people not using stations if they were destructible, that is completely absurd. do you even live in 0.0?losing a station to an enemy alliance can shut you out of that station almost as permanently as the station blowing up for good. if you have half a brain and live in 0.0 you know that it is never wise to stockpile all your assets in one conquerable station or outpost."

1/25/2010,"some recent post about repopulating low sec had me thinking about low sec missions and the autobalancer.for those that dont know about it the autobalancer is a program used by ccp that balance missions rewards (base pay, lp, bonus timer and bonus payout) to the average time used to successfully complete the mission.what is the problem? lets make an esample:mission a is done by 10 pod pilots, 9 in high sec 1 in low sec. thanks to better ships and no interruptions the high sec players complete the mission in 20 minutes. the low sec pilot need 60 minutes. the autobalancer look the completion timer and say (20*9 + 1*60)/10 = 24, so average completion time is 24 minutes and assign as a reward to the mission 1.2 millions as payout, 1,2 millions as bonus and 2.400 lp (totally hypothetic numbers). those number are then multiplied by a modifier based on the security level of the system. as we all know the security level of a system as a very low impact on missioning, what really matter is if is high sec, low sec or 0.0 (0.0 is a kind of middle ground as missioning risk) my suggestion is to split the data gathering from missions, with a set of data for high sec, one for low sec and one for 0.0 while removing the sec system modifier (or greatly reducing its effect as it make a small difference for suicide ganking in high sec). so, after enough missions have been done so that the autobalancer has gathered sufficient data to start adjusting the rewards, we would get something like this:mission a:- average completion time in high sec: 20 minutes: base reward 1 million: bonus reward 1 million: lp 2.000- average completion time in low sec: 60 minutes: base reward 3 millions: bonus reward 3 millions: lp 6.000 - average completion time in 0.0: 40 minutes: base reward 2 million: bonus reward 2 millions: lp 4.000this way the rewards would be more strictly tied to the effective difficulty of a mission when you take environmental effects in consideration .it would be even better if the data are gathered based on the security level of the system where the mission is done and not of the system where the agent is located as currently happen (that will reduce the effect of people gaming the system so they get level 5 missions in high sec and avoid penalizing those that get a low sec mission from a high sec agent).thought and comments?"
1/25/2010,"your under the impression that low-sec missioners are interrupted. i've had days and days of never seeing reds set foot in our system. so balancing under your system = terrible. also, this sounds easy to abuse, this whole ""balance it because big bad piwates are at my door"" deal. no support."
1/25/2010,"supporting myself now that the 5 minutes timer has ended. ccp, please, change the mechanic so that we can support our own proposal directly with the first post. if is verys trange when the proponent don't support his own proposal.the autobalancer use completion time, so, if low sec missions aren't interrupted the average time and the reward would be the same as high sec, as it happen today.the only difference would be that people will not get a automatic payout multiplier for doing them in a 0.5 system instead of a 1.0 system. what is ""terrible"" in that?apparently a lot of people feel that low sec missions need some extra bonus and this seem a decent way to do that."
1/25/2010,"a related issue is that sec status does not accurately reflect the real danger level of a lowsec system. perhaps lowsec sec status should be autobalanced instead? something like: danger level = number of illegal aggressions for over last 15 dayslowsec system truesec would be danger level normalized into 0.01 - 0.49 range. update daily (weekly? monthly?)...so places like ama and rancer would be around 0.01 while less popular lowsec systems would get a higher sec status -- then lowsec sec status would actually mean something, and mission running would get payouts proportionate to the actual threat of hanging around in the system in question."
1/25/2010,"like i've said, i'd expect any mission nerf as a result of this to be small. missioners would still get their bounties, rewards, loyalty points, salvage, standings, the loot would still retain a large amount of its current value. what i'd like to see from this, ultimately,would be the mineral market based on mining, rather than largely propped up by melted down loot. mostly i'd like to see a reason for people to mine the highends in 0.0 (and lowsec, although lowsec needs other aspects fixing before anyone sane would go there to mine) without constantly being undercut by infinite mission loot appearing out of thin air."
1/25/2010,"one of the big questions, and only ccp can answer to it, is?how much of the minerals are supplied by mission loot?and what percentage of the players are supplying that lot?in august 2008 (last data ccp gave) approximately 40% of the minerals did come from reprocessing (not including drone alloys), but that percentage included modules used for mineral compression, reprocessed ships and even t2 reprocessed ships and modules (1% of all morphite did come from reprocessing and no non-drone mission loot include morphite).gathering those data today would be even more difficult that in the past as there is a large number of ships that are melted to recover the minerals but if ccp can get some clear data, cleared as much as possible from the distortions created by mineral compression items and ship reprocessing it would be very interesting.especially if they can add the man/hour spent mining and missioning (or a least the number of players involved) for a better comparison."

1/26/2010,seems unnecessary to me to create twice the numbers of space crap jusy to ram home an ownerships issue that already exists
1/26/2010,"if the amount of junk is the problem shorten the ttl for wrecks and cans to one and a half hours. that will work to lessen lag everywhere.can you please allow players who have no interest in 0.0 or low sec to have an issue addressed with out damning it as whining i have no interest in the politics and mass pvp of eve.i enjoy the game for the pve element.i pay my subscription the same as everyone else.the ninja salvager is like some one running on to the green and kicking your golf ball in to the distance, shouting ""goal"", after you spent time getting it to the tee."
1/26/2010,"so because you don't like what ppl here have taken the time to set you straight on, they are all just 0.0 / losec pvpers come to troll ?not quite mate, you are just horribly wrong and we are pointing it out (for the 100th time at least)"
1/26/2010,"if you must quote real world examples i will once again quote how marine salvage rights work in the real world.we'll assume that wrecks in eve are abandoned in that sense in that the rats flying them are dead.now, the cargo.thus under this law the cargo is the property of the owner of the ship (in eve this would be the pirates' corp but is awarded to the player instead) but as the ship is abandoned salvage rights are available to anyone who gets there first.of course you could point to wreckage in that second quote as being the same as a wreck in eve, but in that isn't the case. a wreck object in eve is the remains of the ship itself not wrecked cargo (which would be the wreckage referred to in the uk law).thus the current system is actually an improvement over rl (player is awarded the cargo ownership instead of the rats' corp) whilst remaining in the spirit of the law (salvage rights of the ship are separate to the cargo).just saying"
1/26/2010,"all very good points.unfortunately the ""salvage is mine!!!"" camp aren't interested in logic, td, as they prove everytime this thread comes around.edit: quoting failure"
1/26/2010,^^^ the carebear would have to leave its own npc corp to do so p.s. this reply made me spit out my gatorade
1/26/2010,"stop playing the game, that's the only way ccp will understand, when player growth in empire stops."
1/26/2010,"good. but then let me translate that quote to eve:""risking his life and property"" == undocking""property of another"" == pretty self explanatory""peril"" == being salvaged by the one who created the wreck in the first placei think this nicely sums up the issue we're trying to discus :) main point being, ofc, the 'property of another' part. the wreck (and hence the salvage, 'the salvage doesn't exist yet' is a technicality, no wreck, no salvage...) is created by the missioner, and as he's the one risking his ship (he is, after all, being shot at) it's not all that strange he feels the salvage is rightfully his too"
1/26/2010,"so what you're saying is if i go out on the seas and sink a boat, i should have the right to be its salvor because i'm risking my life and property to rescue the property of another from peril?you carebears truly are a sick demented twisted lot.seek psychiatric help."
1/26/2010,"no, ap, they're misinterpreting the definition of the word salvor (most likely on purpose).the salvor isn't the person who makes the wreck, it is the person who salvages it."
1/26/2010,"no, if you go out to sea and sink a bout, you should be shot for the pirate you are.if, however, said sinking would be legal, and you would be allowed to loot everything that comes from it (flotsam, jetsam, whatever), you should probably also be the one that gets first rights to be salvor.the original quote illustrated this: ""prior to a salvage attempt the salvor receives permission from the owner or the master to assist the vessel."". owner or master, that's under discussion, but as the flotsam and jetsam rights have been transferred by concord from the npc to the carebear (and on op of that, the npc is dead) it's no stretch to state the 'owner or master' in the comparison would be the carebear.rl comparisons don't map to eve 1:1, as in eve pv(any ship out there) == go out to sea and sink a boat. you are risking life and property because the npc (and players, if you engage in pvp) will shoot back (well, life.. npcs won't pod you) but it can hardly be called a rescue from peril. the only peril the wreck faces is being despawned, well boohoo the only risk a 'ninja' takes is undocking, and they are not rescuing anything. hence, the comparison without explanation is flawed. a marine salvor:- requests permission if it isn't abandoned- actually risks something- has to do a hell of a lot more work than warp in, take a beer and press f1 through f4i got the definition quite right, i think. you either didn't understand my random gibberish, or you're trying to sidetrack the discussion by 'misinterpreting' my crystal clear explanation. truth will be somewhere in between i guess, but it's always more easy to go to some end of an extreme, call the opposing party a 'sick demented twisted lot' and stop arguing because you've 'proved' your point. commonly known as a straw man, and they are unfortunately all too easy, as there probably isn't a single comparison that fits 100%"
1/26/2010,"a note on bookmarks, any smart miner also uses bookmarks -- carefully planning his/her attack on a belt from pre-set positions that ensure that the lasers cover every last rock.no proposal that relies on detecting bookmarks is reasonable.additionally, legitimate miners will fly back and forth in a high-traffic system with lots of can flippers. so that idea is of marginal use as well.i don't like macro miners holding down the price of ore i could be mining more profitably, but i have not yet seen any ""solution"" that didn't take the fun out of being a legitimate miner or target legitimate miners along with the macros."
1/26/2010,"how about smarter belt pirates to cause grief to macro miners? pirates which perferentially target large/valuable ships (hulks), use warp scramblers and engage drones would make life difficult for a macro i think. since they target hulks they would let beginners play freely. genuine human players should be able to respond to rats appropriately, or if needed ask for help in local. i'm not suggesting high dps rats. rather low dps + warp scrambling capability."
1/26/2010,"maybe we are going about this the wrong way.when ccp looked at the rmt problem that is present on pretty much every mmo, they implemented a novel solution... a ccp certified way of meeting the same needs, thus turning a 'problem' into a profitable mechanic.why not do the same thing with macros? produce an api (better yet, a mini virtual machine, and make them code in assembly. limited cycles per real time clock) that runs inside the client and allows scripts to operate. make these scripts packagable items that can be traded on the market (or at least contracts) thus clever writer can make money selling designs to other players.playing field gets leveled and they would create a whole new market type."
1/26/2010,"i dont like seeing green moros's blaster flashlites on my rifter's plating, even if i know it cant hit me with that thing"
1/26/2010,"yes, it would be quite nice is a miss really did look like a miss. the comedy potential could be quite good. if you've never played city of heroes, misses (especially with guns or energy blasts) that were calculated as a miss did cause the animation to show a miss. it really become hilarious when a player wielding a massive machine gun standing, literally, face to face with an npc has the server calculate a miss and you see him suddenly point his gun straight up and start shooting. by the same token, seeing a full broadside from a battleship trying to hit an orbiting frigate splay out in all directions would be damn funny to watch."
1/26/2010,"now, another little addition: could we have tractor beams, neuts, vamps, salvagers analysers and all those things come out of the places where they where mounted instead of guns, the gun hardpoints? at least for those ships that have empty gun hardpoints. also would be nice if every ship had a hardpoint for all the effects like target painters to come out of that would make some sense, looks ridiculous when my myrmidon target paints someone from it;s thrusters while flying away."
1/26/2010,"give the syndicate faction more drug bp's =)after all it's space is supposed to be a pirate haven, and it's market flooded by contraband goods and illegal wares."
1/26/2010,as fleet salvager for corp missions i long for this feature.
1/26/2010,"having been one of those pirates in the past and having as many as 5 disco-bs at a gate to lol at everything from a shuttle to hacs melting even before they can be targeted i would have to agree with the op somewhat.yeah, it was hilarious fun when a smacktard tried to warp through the camp from off angle only to see our repositioned fleet in his face. but it got pretty boring after the first few thousand blue flashes.damage should not be applied until the ship is fully out of warp (you cannot attempt to navigate or attempt to jump, and thus should also not be damaged by aoe effects).just the 0.02 from an old pirate."
1/26/2010,"first, i'm not for or against the dying in warp. second, u gotta realize that a smartbomb battleship with warp core stabilizers is one of the few counters a solo pilot can fly to stand a chance against a blob or just being outnumbered in general (which i'm sure u'll agree that it's even more unbeatable and riskless)."
1/26/2010,"yes, i preferred running on medium because it looked better. if high looked similar to medium this wouldn't have really bothered me at all. it's hardly about the capability of my rig.as it is a lot of color and detail was lost in environments that i'm accustomed to, like in amarr/gallente stations. in other cases distant objects are rendered too sharply, like npc structures in missions and plexes.low is just an awful, colorless mess.what i really want to know, is how less user setting options are considered better by anyone? most games don't just have low/high but many variable options for all kinds of settings. eve is very limited in that regard and taking away more options doesn't make any sense to me."
1/26/2010,"actually, i'm against this. if caod goes away, the idiots might start infesting the useful forums(well, more than usual). i'd rather just let them have their cesspool."
1/26/2010,this.
1/26/2010,oh megasigned. the other forums on eve-o are crap anyway.
1/26/2010,"no one is forcing you to read caod you know. lest have our fun there, its like smack in local. in my humble opinion if you dont like it dont read it i respect the posts and tone on this forum. the unwritten rule on assembly hall is no smack an troll. i never smack or troll or flame on this forum even thou some of the proposals is just an open invitation. i think its only fair we have caod where some of us can behave like children. me included. i may be childish on caod from time to time but i find it funny. in my book there are two options either dont read caod or to quote gandhi: be the change you want to see in this world now back to caod to act like a child"
1/26/2010,so what's your proposal? pictures of drill sergeants and 150-point red font?
1/26/2010,thank you for the thumbs up :)
1/26/2010,this is so exploitable it isnt' even funny...
1/26/2010,i /support itwould make the game much more interesting.
1/26/2010,supporting risk
1/26/2010,"ccp needs to give the csm secretary mod powers over the csm forums. that would solve all this stuff cleanly. sadly, either the forum software doesn't support that, they're not willing to, or both. hopefully it's the former and spacebook will fix that. until then, though, it's not going to happen. still, supporting it - it really ought to be fixed."
1/26/2010,yes.marking threads with proposals picked up by the csm is also part of the package of improvements to the assembly hall forum tools.
1/26/2010,"are you mad, the csm4 secretary is a total noob the current system is pants, there isn't anything to suggest that a topic you are raising is there already let alone been voted on. even adding subcategories would help however we are stuck with this for the moment.i do think it would improve matters if it was possible to actively lock threads once they have been raised (or gone inactive to stop thread necromancy). this could apply to duplicates too, lock with a link to the master topic.sadly this would take a significant amount of effort to keep on top of so i can't see this working without more ccp involvement...i do support this idea of a quick indication that a topic has been raised/passed/rejected though."
1/26/2010,"what is it with the obsession to avoid necros? does a good idea get bad just because no one posted in the thread for a month? if you start locking them for that, people will have yet another reason to bump threads. and when that fails, they will create a new (duplicate) thread, which will have to start from scratch getting support, the same things will be discussed, etc, so imo nothing is gained."
1/26/2010,"after that mazilliu person you think that's a good idea? no way should a csm have mod powers. as someone who just recently necro'd a bunch of ideas i thought were good, i disagree. they're inactive 90 days after the last post, not before. a good idea is a good idea no matter how long ago it was raised."
1/26/2010,"if it was a good idea why wasn't it being supported? also who said a month?this forum isn't a suggestions and ideas forum, it is a place for people to post a proposal, gather support for it (either gain 25% of the last voter turnout or getting a csm representative on side) and have it put to csm. if stuff hasn't been picked up and hasn't had a comment for say 6 months lets draw a line under it and move on.people do that anyway if people are campaigning for support on a proposal (as they should be and via other channels not just here) then bumping is naturally done by people supporting (or disputing) the idea. bumping only becomes a problem when the bumps become the proposer clinging on to a failed idea in the hope that they will eventually gather a few more supporters.but considering csm don't have mod powers this is a moot point because maz is the template for all csm reps i saw this and also noted that you deliberately bypassed the 5 min forum timer in the process and pushed all the active threads off the front page, well done note that most if not all of those necro'd threads have had no further support since your bump which basically shows why they ended up inactive in the first place. also a quick look shows the majority of those threads have less than 20-30 supports even though they have been around for over 90 days whilst a couple threads had around 60-80 supports.i'm not saying the ideas are bad, but if there isn't any support perhaps the proposal needs reworking.anyway we are getting off topic. some indication that a thread has been taken to a csm meeting is a good idea."
1/26/2010,"supported. it would be good to know when csm has looked at a topic and discussed it. you might have two colors, one for ""csm has looked at it"" and one for ""csm has made a decision on it"", since there might still be some debate and suggestions after csm has taken an initial look."
1/26/2010,"it was. but it got bumped off the front page and then forgotten.and if it was forgotten for a good reason, no need to lock it, right?you among all people should know that csm can only handle a limited amount of issues. thus lots of proposals with excellent support are not brought up, because there was something more pressing/interesting at the time.really? other than f&i, what other channels do we have?yes, and at some point the discussion ceases because everything has been said and all interested assembly hall regulars have voted. if you click through the pages you'll see countless proposals with incredible high support which never got raised.yes. but with better forum tools this could be handled as well. like auto locking based on no-votes or even better, a system that makes bumping unnecessary..."
1/26/2010,"probably not, it was just a suggestion because i like things to be neat and tidy if it is a really pressing issue for somebody i wouldn't expect them to leave it for 3+ months without a bump or an attempt to get a csm rep to pick it up.many people don't use the eve-o forums but have in game channels (eve-bloggers, industry, si-radio etc) which they use to point people at relevant proposals about their common interests. not to mention other eve related forums, corp / alliance forums etc. it depends on the idea of course but there are other ways to get support and each support is a bump as well.but if people are behind the proposal they should be approaching the csm reps most closely related to that area of gameplay and pointing at the level of support achieved. it is a safe bet it will be missed if it has dropped below say page 5 and a quick eve mail with a link to it won't hurt. if you get no reply within a week or so you can post that on the thread for a bump and a kick up the backside of the csm reps i agree totally, we are limited by the current system hence my support of your other thread i don't speak for the whole csm (except when publishing minutes etc ) but i figured when i had time i would enter some of these discussions. i know not everyone will agree with me which is fine, the rest of the csm don't agree with me all the time either"
1/26/2010,no. but if it happens once it can happen again. ccp already demonstrated their lack of concern for the integrity of the csm. give the wrong csm member mod powers and we might as well all forget this forum for 6 months.
1/26/2010,"minor, but sensible. that said, i want that ""view available contracts"" feature everywhere, not just on scans."
1/26/2010,"missile re-targetingsince we can't seem to get faster missiles without breaking the game. what if guided missiles (light/heavy/cruise/citadel cruise) were able to re-target when a ship has been destroyed or warps away?say you are shooting at fred in an apocalypse from 220km away. fred sees a ton of missiles coming, and warps away or is destroyed by turret fire. all the missiles heading towards fred will be diverted to ralph, who you also have targeted and flagged as a secondary target.guided warp missilessecond solution, which imo would work nice for ships without a missile velocity bonus. what if guided missiles could warp?example jim raynor in his raven fires his cruise launchers they fly out ~20km and after 20km they warp towards the target and strike. there would still be a short flight time delay however cruise missiles would swiftly strike ships from a long distance.the only drawback to this is that cruise missiles generally do superior dps to turret ships setup to shoot that far.. so maybe we should introduce special warp enabled guided missiles, they would still have their base range limitations that are currently implemented (would only be a factor for light/heavy really but i don't think frigates should be shooting lights 250km away) but could strike from long distance.. of course having an onboard warp engine would mean a smaller warhead and less damage output.. but if a raven or typhoon for example with guided warp missiles could do ~300dps from 220km that would be kinda nice and mean people can bring missile ships to fleets."
1/26/2010,"2nd proposal: what kind of use would missile range skills have then?i think the normal warp mechanics should apply here, meaning missiles should only warp if the target is 150+km away.all in all i think missiles are fine. ravens are good at killing support."
1/26/2010,"would still be quite useful for rockets/heavy assault/torpedo/citadel torpedo and would also still increase the maximum range of all missiles. :)150km+ makes sense though, yes. i would still give the missile an 'arming' time, i don't think they should warp straight out of the chute, 'yanno what i mean?"
1/26/2010,the re-targeting aspect would only be the feasible solution... but only if it requires skills... and an additional high slot and or mid slot module other than the launcher.such a thing would be a bit overkill and would threaten balance if some sort of penalty wasn't in place.when i used missiles heavily i've always frowned when i wasted a salvo of torps or missiles when the target was destroyed or off grid.if you where getting aggro'd the missiles should retarget... what happens if you getting repped? well thats aggro under the mechanics to a degree.so you got a few things to work out.all in all this could be a can of worms.
1/26/2010,flag secondary targets with overview?
1/26/2010,could work. :)
1/26/2010,"what if missiles were shot out from the launchers like normal turrets,but they wont reach the target only appear like 50km before the target then the missiles would travel from there to hit the target the same way as they do it now. ofcourse the flight time would get a decrease according to target distance.so it wouldnt matter if the target is 50km away or 200km away , the missiles would have the same delay time.the re-targeting system seems too complicated and imho bad for lag."
1/26/2010,this is a great ideaall the really lame ass idea's will forever be at the top of the forumas a constant flow of peops show there non support.if you dont support an issue/proposal there no need to post at all.you are not supporting a topic by erm not ticking support or even posting.[not supportted] < just in case you dont get it by my lack of not supporting this propal by not providing my support
1/26/2010,"iam, for the love of god, crop that picture so it doesn't break my browser. or better yet, stick it on eve files."
1/26/2010,"a direction crosshair in space was the way frontier/first enc did it and that worked very well.i love the new look of powersliding my bs , but somesort of clearing indication of ship travel would be useful. using the dusts travels direction is a bit squint inducing."
1/26/2010,"i have been thinking about this for a long time, and while i know i haven't worked out the kinks in this here is my proposal.improve researching tech i blueprints with the following following the give & take principles. and adding a new skill called ship customization (or something similar). giving 1% adjustment per level max 4%using the abaddon as my base.amarr battleship skill bonus:* 5% bonus to large energy turret damage per level * 5% armor resistance per level so say i want to make an abbadon with better resistances i would following the g&t principles adjust the bonuses accordingly. using the skill at level 3 you would get the following.* 2% bonus to large energy turret damage per level * 8% armor resistance per level or* 8% bonus to large energy turret damage per level * 2% armor resistance per level now to take this even a step further i would also suggest at say level 5 of the skill the researcher/inventor could remove one of the following skills. and replace it with an appropriate racial bonus for the bonus that is removed. so you don't get 5% armor resistances & say 5% armor or armor repair / repair time.this also gives to specialized ship builders something to leave their mark on, maybe modified by or built by ( corp/alliance ). giving sellers & owners a chance to make a name for themselves as "" corp specializes in building this the of ship ""visually identical unless you scan the ship with a ship scanner most people would not know if your ship is built to be a glass cannon or a tanker from hades.as to the technical aspect of this, i would treat is the same as tech ii, but would require more research time for this modification as well as depending on the modification the use of different research materials including possibly a bpc of a ship using one of the bonuses wanted for said changing of bonuses.my two cents, while a rough draft this to me is something to think over.edit: changed proposal to idea as it really is more of an idea."
1/26/2010,it's interesting... but how would the market work? it would need to have 100's of entries for each ship for each possible configuration. it doesn't sound plausible.
1/26/2010,"the market would work just like it does with bpo's and bpc's, there isn't a seperate entry for every combonation of me and pe, is there?"
1/26/2010,well that's because you can't put researched bpo's or bpc's on the market. so that only furthers my point.
1/26/2010,"i would like to fully customize the t1 platforms. say you start with an unbonused platform, where you can adjust powergrid, cpu, slots, dronebay, bandwidth, turret points, targeting range, etc, etc and bonuses. each race's ships would have to stay within the race specific bonuses though. no laser and ecm bonus on gallente ships. i believe it will never happen though, becouse of the autobalancing problem. i can see how the dominix upgraded to tier 3 battleship with rr range bonus instead of hybrid bonus might be a problem."
1/26/2010,"as for the market, it would need some major adjustments. again still not 100% i have been tossing this idea around in my head. this is more of a write it down and get input type proposal. i was speaking with my corp leader and we went into a tangent on how the whole market system would need to be adjusted around this.to me it's as simple as contracting bpc's, which would include the information of what bonuses the bpc had. ( yes read your contracts to the fullest ) i personally have issues with the contract system but that's something for another day."
1/26/2010,"so just to make it clear, none of the bpc or final product created from those bpcs i.e. the ships would be sold on the market?i'm going to have to say no, again nothing wrong with your idea but breaking the entire market around this idea is bad. the potential benefits do not outweigh the downside. not by a long shot."
1/26/2010,"as it stands no, it would be contract only as some ships could be 4% to 6% or 2 to 8% on their bonuses. it would make it hell on the current market system.if you have a solution to this, i would be willing to hear it."
1/26/2010,"this cannot possibly be balanced, nor can it possibly be workable. no thank you."
1/26/2010,i think it's a really cool idea!.... pimp my boat!!! yeah i like it...... ferrari corporation!
1/26/2010,not supported.
1/26/2010,"more options to customize ships would always be nice, but it's hard to make it balanced as it is (some ships are almost overpowered while others are practically useless). the market problems aside, i could only support it if some kind of handicap were included with the modification: for example sacrifice a rig slot if you want to adjust the ship bonuses... of course then the natural course would be to forget the invention stuff altogether and just make new two rigs where one increases the bonus 1 and decreases the bonus 2 and the other works vice versa. make it also unusable in t2/t3 ships.not supported for now, as i can't see it happening in the foreseeable future."
1/26/2010,i'm against this. a bit less annoyance is not worth the possibility of putting someone into an irreparable game state.
1/26/2010,"right, but the simplest solution would be to remove the automatic sawning of rookie ships and add a button ""request 1 rookie ship in this station"".this way the player could spawn a rookie ship everywere he want (even where he already has a ship available or in a hostile station) but the system will not automatically generate tons of rookie ships. add a small cooldown period to avoid people that would spawn tons of them for ""fun""."

1/26/2010,"i remember a video interview with one of the devs who stated this is a result they are working to achieve.it was in one of the fanfest vids. so either they are still working on it, or it may not be possible at the moment and was placed on hold.so just keep reminding 'em ;)"
1/26/2010,not sure whether i'd call this making probing more fiddly or just plain easier. probing does not need to be made an easier.i can't support this unless you add in the op that there wouldd be an option to turn this off...cause sometimes i like my probes right where they are and i don't want them moving around all by themselves....

1/26/2010,"i do not play remotely, i play where i'm at, i just want to spend my free time on playing and not installing patches, if i could install patches remotely - i would spend 10 minits for all machines, but i cant and i spend few hours if patch is not very bigi mean for what are we launching login screen when we cant login because of incompatibility? it makes no seeeense or it is?"
1/26/2010,eve addict much?sheesh... so let me get this straight... your throwing a fit over the time it takes to patch?what is this a troll?yeah.... not supported.
1/26/2010,"what? cmon guys, do u realy like starting/closing client every patch for no reason? just to see incompatibility? do u like no direct links to patches and no resume in autopatcher downloads?i don't care about traffic, but someone careswhat i care is my free time, thats alli think it's more comfortable to patch first and to login afteror maybe it would be better to login first and patch after? lol"
1/26/2010,couldn't you just use the repair tool?
1/26/2010,allow me to clear up your confusion.your using a client.... a client that has no idea whats going on until it launches and checks in with big mama which is the server.you log in... client says hi... sup?server says hey... can't let you in... you need a patch.you download patch... client shuts down... patches.... you restart client... rinse and repeat... and hey...what do yah know.. your in.what your asking for is for a clinet that is always active and on hidden in the background... for what... a measly 10 minutes of frustration on your part?dude... you got issues.time for you to take a walk in the park and remind yourself there is more to life then a measly missed 10 minutes of eve online.amiright? k.... have a great day!ps: we don't have a problem with it because we can find things to do while we wait for it to patch.however if we have to reinstall the game... that's not fun.... but there is no issue... works as intended.and this doesn't belong here... should go to issues/workarounds. : o p
1/26/2010,"repair tool for what?i just want normaly functioning autoapdater, without unnesesary moves and loadslook, mate, in several other mmorpgs patchs installing befor the client loadsdo u know why? because even chruker's server stats"

1/26/2010,"i support this idea and wish to subscribe to your newsletter.except i can't ""watch"" a thread which is another missing feature this forum should have (and only this forum or spammage will ensue).better tools to enable people to find and support existing threads instead of the same issue being raised in 15 slightly differently named threads would be a good start. however i would go as far as to suggest that the csm should have a sub-site rather than simply a couple of forum sections. something with a more formalised proposal raising system (gameplay categories, problem, solution, pros, cons etc as specific sections so things are all in the same format). it would also create and attach a discussion thread for public comment as well as support, not support and don't care options. the system should allow the proposer and current csm reps to make edits to the proposal (which like the wiki are logged so you can see who changed what).it would be almost a wiki with discussion thread but slightly more formal in structure (you can't rely on people putting things in the correct format, they can't manage that now. it would have to be enforced by the system).better tools (i don't mean csm reps even if you think we are tools ) would mean better proposals going forward and thus the csm will be better used."

1/26/2010,everything has been sayd
1/26/2010,"this issue was raised to ccp by the first csm, after really strong urging from jade constantine. the consensus then seemed to be that actual outright destruction was bad(if only because it would wreck player's asset lists in rather unpleasant fashion), but a mechanic whereby they can be sacked and left in a damaged state(unusable, but repairable if someone wants to spend several billion) was generally fairly well-received. this would also work well with the new outpost mechanics - make it so that you have to sit through 2 rf timers to take a station, but only one to wreck it. the idea isn't bad, but no support, because it's already been raised."
1/26/2010,1) find alliance with most dreads/titans/caps2) blow all hostile 0.0 stations up3) ???4) profit!
1/26/2010,"perhaps not destroyable, but absolutely wreckable to the extent of not allowing docking and access to hangars. you can still undock in your current ship, but the station needs repairs/rebuilding at some cost to recover other assets."
1/26/2010,"that route seems the most reasonable, but is there a reason to just have 2 states. recovering existing assets shouldn't be much of a hasle compared having to repair the station in full working order.i would suggest at least 3 different status levels. first is fully functional with all the services working, second is destroyed with only the ability to get out stuff already in there. maybe you can still get in with a pod and leave with small ships/shuttles, but can't bring any new ships/supplies. third stage where you could dock normally and use it as a base, but services wouldn't be working. more could be added as people see fit, but you need few different station graphics/models to represent the damage and reconstruction anyway, so you might as well have corresponding status levels to the outposts to give more options."

1/26/2010,thank you cms for ignoring us (players) twice.good job.
1/26/2010,it is csm not cms this topic only has 24 supporters and was submitted too late for the meeting on the 17th (it didn't have 7 full days before the meeting). we only had limited time for issues on the 24th and thus this wasn't looked at.if you want this brought up ahead of better supported proposals i suggest you seek out one of the mission focussed csm reps and get them to take it forward.alternatively get 25% of the voter turnout from the csm4 election to support the issue which will force it to be included on the agenda.
1/26/2010,"there were 20k votes cast in the csm 4 election. has any assembly hall thread ever had anything even vaguely close to 5k supports? looking over the first few pages, even widely supported threads like 'boost afs' and the original 'dead horse pos' only have a few hundred supports. 5k supports is also considerably greater than the number of votes received by any one member of the current csm. don't you think this number should be revised downwards?"
1/26/2010,"i'm simply quoting from the csm devblog. imo even 400-500 supports would be beyond most proposals!this may well be a topic for discussion with ccp, in the meantime the only practical way to have a proposal raised is by talking to a csm rep who campaigned along similar issues/gameplay. the other point here is that if you can't get even a single csm rep to support an idea what do you think the chances are of it being passed at a meeting? is this fact part of why so few people support proposals?"
1/26/2010,"seems helen's a bit butthurt about drones.boat violenced by 'em a few times?edit: there was nothing wrong with my proposal, the maffs are entirely up to ccp as has been stated. i gave plenty of options and suggestions. and reasoning, lets not forget reasoning behind it. someone just obviously did not read the proposal.stop being racist against drones 1. there's no drone implants in game. none, zip zero zilch nada goose egg the big fat null. 2. if they are meant as a ""secondary"" damage system, then why are there drone boats? what about the myrmidon, pilgrim, curse, ishtar, and gila? unlike the vexor and domi, those boats only get dps bonuses to drones.3. ""large rigs only working on large drones."" wtf does this even mean teadaze? do large weapon damage rigs only give bonuses to large guns? no, they give that bonus to all guns of that weapon type. so yes, a large drone damage rig will give its damage bonus to every combat drone.you want a specific proposal? here it is:dear ccp claus, there are no drone implants in game. the drone users of eve would like some.also, while you're at it, a drone damage rig would be nice."
1/26/2010,"i will quote whole proposal as raised in response. where is the specific reasoning behind drone rigs and implants beyond ""because other weapon systems have them"".if this was not your original proposal then i suggest you contact the csm rep who raised it and ask them why they didn't include any detailsso working from this proposal there are no options and not a single suggestion for types, stats etc. saying that it is up to ccp to design everything is pure laziness. certainly they will tweak what is proposed (if it is passed) but they shouldn't have to do all the initial research on a csm proposal. it should have included examples in the first place (mostly to support why they are needed).the irony is i like the idea of drone implants (as i stated) providing they are sized as per weapon implants.sized rigs are new which is why we currently have a small sentry drone augmenter which is a bit daft when only one ship (iirc) can even use it (and why would you fit one sentry in a frig over 5 t2 lights).so yes, the current system is that any size of rig gives the bonus to any size of gun/launcher etc. however the only drone damage rig is specifically locked to sentry drone damage. have you considered why ccp decided that only sentries should have a damage rig? it was never addressed in the proposal but it must have reasoning behind it, no?now if we look at ship bonuses, all ships with weapon bonuses have it apply only to a single size of gun/launcher except some missile boats where light and heavy missiles are bonused and all drone boats where it applies to all sizes of drone. the domi (for example) is the only battleship that gets a bonus to light weapons (when using light drones of course). if there was a general drone damage rig then the domi would be the only battleship with a double bonus to light weapons. even having single bonused light drones off a rigged battleship is a nerf to frigate pilots with no drawback to the battleship (well it would take up the rig slots but that is all).i simply wondered if drone rigs should be sized (which wasn't possible originally with the one size fits all rig) so that the bonuses apply to the size of drone appropriate to the ship. it was a topic for conversation and something not addressed in the proposal.i am not against the idea of more drone rigs, even though there are already 16 drone rigs in game.that was even less specific than the proposal we voted on"
1/26/2010,"okay, let's try this again, number 3.please examine the following game grind issues and put them forward for change.sorting corporate deliveries (as personal assets can be sorted by range).allow us to get rid of the market over/under percentage warning popup. if we can get rid of the criminal action popup, why must we suffer this thing with no recourse? in the end, as has been mentioned in about 4 separate threads on the assembly forum, enable the option to keep or discard all of the various popups, per user preferance.science and industry ui improvements, in line with the market, so industrialists can see how many job slots they have open/in use.pos fabrication arrays (reactors, refineries, ect) showing up on the industry ui would also be a boon to production managers. this has not been brought up in the assembly hall but can fall under amber's ui suggestions.why do i get the feeling i'm merely beating my head on a wall here, anyway?"
1/26/2010,i'm pretty sure that'd be too late to get on the iceland agenda.
1/26/2010,"only 14 supports, one from a csm rep - i suggest you contact them directly to get this moved forwardonly 5 supports - have you tried speaking to the industrial focussed reps about this? why are there 4 threads about it anyway, are people not willing to support somebody else's thread on the same issue?7 supports, one from an alternate csm rep - again have you tried speaking to the industrial focussed reps about this?i know the feeling well. i put together a sticky post about how to get a proposal raised and picked up. thus i suggest you speak to one or more of the industrialist csm reps and get them to pick up these issues because i don't think you're going to get these picked up on supports alone (25% of the last voter turnout required)."

1/27/2010,"all the ""don't leave the pc out!"" comments are pretty silly. every shooter in existence that can be played on both pc and console keeps those 2 realms separate. not only is it hard (impossible?) to integrate sony ps3 with pc etc, but it'd also be unfair. fps on pc offers superior control and response time due to the way the mouse works. this isn't anti-console bias (i now prefer to play on a console) but it simply is. dust cannot keep them separate as there is only one eve universe. pc based groups would have an unfair advantage over console based groups.would it work if eve had 100 servers ala wow? sure. but it isn't so it won't. i'm pretty amazed there are this many people who are posting when this is so obviously never going to happen."

1/27/2010,"that's a hell of a long post to make just because you didn't get your own way.the csm's purpose isn't to give one segment of the player base everything they want. ccp have made their position on salvage rights very clear, and as far as they're concerned, threads like this are predicated on a false assumption: that salvage ever belonged to the person who created the wreck.it has been definitely proven that this is neither the case in real life, nor was it ever the case in the game.the issue here is not the csm failing, but a widespread misconception amongst a segment of the playerbase.you have completely failed to make the case that you are entitled to the salvage from wrecks you create. you can, if you like, try and make a case that you should be entitled to it. but that would involve demonstrating that high sec missioners dont make enough isk, already face too much competition from other hi-sec professions, and dont have a diverse enough set of income sources from the isk, minerals, loot, lp, faction gain and such salvage as you already get.good luck with that."

1/27/2010,"in this case, ccp has made it clear, time and again, how they want salvaging to function. they're not idiots, and their argument isn't simply, ""working as intended."" there are six or seven posts that have been copied and pasted into this thread and just about all the others on ninja salvaging that explain their views on it--in more detail than your own arguments."

1/27/2010,"or have a 'garage alt' which neatly gets around the whole issue.which is why they all have 'garage alts' (or similar arrangements) to entirely avoid all that risk. neat huh?no, i would point out that this is the status quo. most -10 characters have shopping alts, mission alts, etc. they don't even need to be on a separate account.what's making me laugh is that you are actually proposing this as an argument. do you even play eve?strange - i know all manner of people in various militias who are kos in various areas of space who use market alts etc. to entirely get around this 'limitation'.i'm laughing again - but only at your ""argument"".no, they do not. they only have those drawbacks if you have an allergy to having other characters (you don't even need other accounts in most cases) to do those things for you. assets, ships, etc. are easily transferred between such characters, even if on the same account, through the contract system.the 'limitations' you describe, simply do not exist. they exist for a single character but any player can get around them so absurdly easily simply by having a different character do them - even on the same account so it won't even cost him or her more money.you're on the csm and you do not know the most common way eve is played?actually, if you think about it, it increases risk. at least for those who use it.currently reality is that when supercarriers and titans are not needed a character enters them and logs out. they vanish into the great beyond where they are entirely and completely invulnerable until needed. their pilots then go do other things until those ships are needed again.this isn't a security buff, quite the contrary, it puts the vessel more at risk because it is in game to be attacked.your argument is so nonsensical that i can only assume that you must fear that, were security to be a bit more sensible, ccp would put in a rule that you couldn't log out in a supercap which really would greatly reduce their security. so either that's your real reason for trying to torpedo a most reasonable request or you honestly don't understand the way the game is commonly played at all."
1/27/2010,"they clearly have their agenda.note the silly 'point' about somehow my not replicating the original post (rather than a more sensible link) somehow invalidates the proposal.i could cut and paste it in five seconds and waste more of my time, but i'm thinking we'll have to wait for either a more reasonable csm member to come along, or just a more reasonable csm.by the way - nice job chasing that tri fleet through our system the other day. it's always great to see you guys out - shame we couldn't have caught them between us - but then they'd have just logged out."
1/27/2010,hahaha! oh wow.by the same token most supercap pilots have 'garage alts' and they don't even need to be on a seperate account either.it is possible to live as a -10 without any alts at all. just as it is possible to live in a supercap without any alts at all.in fact all of your counter arguements revolve around 'but these people can use alts to get around their limitations!'... so why the hell can't you?

""possible"" doesn't mean ""it's a good idea"". or ""commonly done."" it just means ""not impossible.""i can. easily. even reasonably cheaply. that doesn't mean it's right, however. as i've mentioned several times, i think alts are the thing that damages eve the most. my wife disagrees, and has two accounts so she can dual box and mine and haul at the same time - it's not for me to force her to adhere to my ethics even though i pay for all three of our family's accounts. it's not a matter of money, or of time. it's a matter of ethics.i happen to think that it's wrong. therefore i am not in favor of doing it.perhaps i shouldn't really expect someone who cannot adhere to a real world legal agreement over an unfair advantage in a video game to understand ethics, however."
1/27/2010,"that depends on your definition of an alt.an alt typically is one of 3 slots on a single account in addition to the main that is created to do various things... like a cyno alt.i don't consider it to be an alt if its an actual paid for account.but then that's where the debate starts.bottom line... if your paying for that ""additional"" char... i don't got a problem with it.which is why i favor killing off all alt's and forcing people to get multiple subscriptions.but then no one would like that... would solve a-lot of problems and make the game interesting tho.(my corporation however would kill me... >.>;;;)"
1/27/2010,"ok then. it's ""possible"" to own and use a supercarrier without a parking alt. just because you are ""not willing to try it"" does not mean that the game should be altered to suit your needs and particular ethical bent.oh snap.please don't lecture me on ethics sunshine. i'll eat you for breakfast."
1/27/2010,"lol no wonder why csm is at the state as it is now, like these 2 elitist csm delegates telling us ,that we dont realy want a supercap ,if we dont want to stuck an alt in one like forever.mothership use is so limited they are just a buffed carriers with ew immunity and bombers + extra hp.they cost a lot and cant be insured. why docking one could be exploited but anchoring one should be fine.1 for one would like to buy a mothership for my alt ,but because i wont be able to use that char for anything else forces me to not to do it."
1/27/2010,definitely needs to happen. 100% omniscient intel in a system with no effort at all really sucks :(
1/27/2010,"while annoying when trying to find prey there needs to be balance.all advantage can not be in the attacker since that would mean that no one at all would be in systems apart from jumping between places to fuel stuff making, especially 0.0, almost completely devoid of any life.there needs to be at least a fair chance of someone getting away rather than being a free kill."
1/27/2010,"supported, local is ridiculous out of hisec.so. maybe lowsec could have the number of pilots but no names, unless they talk. 0.0 could have totally nothing unless they talk, but possibly have inteligence sov structures to gather said intel?anyway local currently sucks and creates a perfect intel device for free and with no skill to use... change needed."
1/27/2010,"your idea would make lag far worse than retargeting.your asking for missiles to spawn off-grid and on-grid at a ""supposed random"" location and then to seek a target and hit said target provided the target is there to begin with... a target likely moving.might want to think about that a bit. :)"
1/27/2010,"no... what would be the drawback of missiles then compared to gunscurrently they do decent dps and dont worry about tracking, and most of the missiles dont worry about range eitheri would support this if say a bs sized cruise missile would have a speed of 300m/s so a cruiser can outrun it... just like it can outmanuver a bss gunsbut that way the change would be as much of a nerf as your proposal is an unneeded boostedit... i wont eaven start about the warping missiles"
1/27/2010,"i see you have never used missiles then. missiles dont have to worry about tracking? the stupidest thing i heared so far , missiles are more penalized by targets speed than guns, same with range for delay dmg.they dont do decent dps if you add on their disadvantages,thats why nobody uses missiles at long range.drake draconis: why would my idea worse for lag? missiles only spawn closer to target not at the missile ship, +1 animation between them thats all. the retarget thing would be the laggy one ,but that is an assumption as we dont know how the game is programed."
1/27/2010,"nobody uses missiles because strategically they don't make sense. can't hold a tackle at long range, and guns do instant damage at range. why would you want to leave your snipers at a perch for the entire time it takes a missile to travel 100km so that you can hit the target that may or may not be there anymore.to say that nobody uses missiles because of their low dps is a bit of a farce."
1/27/2010,"i havent wrote that missiles have low dps , i wrote missiles dont have enought dps to even out their disadvantages at long range.it doesnt matter if you have a weapon which has much better dps than the other weapon if it cant realistically apply that dmg like blaster is fleets/missions."
1/27/2010,warping missiles sounds extremely awesome but it would be overpowered with existing missile stats :p
1/27/2010,"on trying to think of a comment to make for this, the only thing i could think of when i was about to hit post reply was: all trollish ideas, better have a serious one.so this is my actual try.the missile re-targeting is seriously needed, for pvp and pve, during a mission is is so annoying to see 6+ missiles just fly off into space when there are ships just next to it that i am already targeting that those 6 would really help in killing... just as long as you don't make the ai like fof, i don't want it randomly targeting my drones.i had another idea for the warping missiles, but that to sounded trollish..."
1/27/2010,fof missiles could warp. not sure.. let missiles re-target to watever you paint with a traget painter only. so whatever you yourself paint with a tp the missiles go to it if previous target vanishes.
1/27/2010,i will get the teleporting ability for my drones too?
1/27/2010,"sorry to say this but both suggestion one and two are awful. missiles have no tracking penalties like turrets. the price you pay for this is that missiles some times dont hit target either because said target warps or gets destroyed. im equally annoyed when my turrets fail to hit small fast moving targets. thats the price i pay for instant damage. yes i know that you can fit modules to make turret tracking better but by doing that you take up some mid or low slots, witch could be used for other things."
1/27/2010,"i think people have to accept that this can be considered one of the penalties for missile use. as has been said, sometimes turrets miss completely, wasting ammo - should turret users be guaranteed a 100% hit rate as well?not supported - missiles would become too overpowered."
1/27/2010,first try out missiles in fleet then come back to tell us how usefull you were.i love when people posting about things they have no idea how they work at all.
1/27/2010,"if you're caldari and want to take part in a long range bs fight then train for a rokh. i'm sick of people wanting to homogenise all of the races, weapons and nuances in this game. guns are not missiles and missiles are not guns, they both have their pros and cons."
1/27/2010,"thug you where not quoting me i thing i will dignify that with an answer.i personally fly minmatar, caldare and galente. if i ever brought a missile ship to at fleet fight i would ask me fleet mates to primary me just for bringing thatmissiles suck in large fleet pvp. go to dotlan en se the kill mails after a large 0.0 battle i bet you most people fly amar and minmatar closely followed by galente.if you want to do better in fleets my advice would be to train for minmatar. minmatar skips are extremely versatile and have a high dps or alpha if you have just a sleight of how to fitt them."
1/27/2010,"everybody knows that fleet fights are for amarr > matar ships.this is the problem the long range missiles+ caldari missile boats were designed for fleet fights in mind.thats why the huge range they can operate at, but because missile sux at long range these cant do their intended roles. is there any reason to use a cerb/nighthawk/raven in fleets?not realy.so eighter they should change those to be good at close-medium range or fix missiles at long range.because other races were designed for the close-medium range , i would go with the fix missiles part.oh and crosstraining is not a solution or an option."
1/27/2010,are you retired?missile boats are particularly good at close ranges. just because they get a range bonus doesn't mean they are 'long range' only. it also means they can utilise their close range weapon systems at longer ranges than their counterparts.and why is cross training not an option? should all the races be able to do everything? of course not. please for the love of black jesus stop trying to dumb the game down.
1/27/2010,this and give me just one good reason why cross training is not an option?
1/27/2010,"retired huh? no and you?missile boats are particularly good at close range? realy? like the cerb is good with hams+ tackle gear ?cross trainging is bad for diversity and balance everybody knows thatshould all races be able to do everything? hmm what about caldari should be able do its inteded tactic which is long range , oh and put matar back to their place by nerfing arties at least they should not be able to do everything according to youblack jesus? it is so wrongdumb the game down? so asking for balance is dumbing the game down? why? because then other races then matar/amarr would be viable?pls stop trolling"
1/27/2010,"stop sperging out bro.yes, a cerb is good with hams and tackle gear and is also an excellent hml platform for stand off support in small to medium sized gangs. please tell me what other hac is capable of 500+ dps at 40+km.if you want to fly a caldari bs in a long range 'fleet fight' then fly a rokh or a scorp. you will have no problem applying instant dps or effects.protip: there's more to pvp than long range 0.0 slugfests and not everyone is inclined to use the traditional sniper fleets for those, in fact since joining a 0.0 entity i haven't once fitted long range guns on my bs.i happen to fly all races and i'm perfectly happy with the performance of caldari and missile boats in general.please learn to play, then learn to spell and then stop trolling me."
1/27/2010,"well this is disturbing to say the least. after doing a search on eve-search for the whole issue of larkonisgate, after reading this dev blog here, just to get a better idea of what happened i found this thread and having a bit of time on my hands and a fresh cup of coffee i decided to go against my own judgement and read the forums for once.first of i like the idea of the csm. its a whole new twist on the issue of game designer vs the player base and something that makes me proud of ccp (being an icelander i have the same chronic sickness as the rest of the country).but like dirty wizard says and then mazzilliu clearly confirms is that the csm is broken. the csm is not broken because the large alliances have representatives in the council. it is understandable that the largest bodies of players that have grouped themselves together vote for a player within their own alliance. this mirrors what happens in real life, you vote for the person that can best represent your views and ideas. and as the council says at c.a 35 minutes into the video here they are able to agree on issues concerning high, low and zero sec play styles (9/0 vote on something concerning missions at 39:18 min into the above video).no the reason the csm is broken is that it allows a whole seat (or more) to be occupied by a player that clearly has no real drive to be in the csm (mazzilliu). she acts like a little kid in a school yard trying to act cool and tough against well written and thought out concerns, about the issues/ideas that the csm is spending their time talking about, instead of acting like a representative of the players and taking her position seriously and with a little pride.i have no ounce of fear regarding if ccp will allow the change mazzilliu suggested and the council voted on and passed, by a margin of 1 vote mind you, to get implemented because every individual can see the potential for misuse. the csm is not a council that can impose its will on ccp. this they have said many times.but i guess that having the longest possible term only 1 year, to weed out those who do not deserve to be there, would only limit the use of those council members that actually do take their position with pride and realize what kind of unique position they are in.and having a longer term (+1 year) would only create a larger possibility for individuals that think the csm is a joke to get elected repeatedly by those who share their narrow mindedness.and how would ccp ever promote the idea of democracy to the players if they would simply kick out those csm members that are obviously not doing their job correctly. even if the reasons were sound they would still be going against the principles that are the cornerstones of the csm. this, it would seem, shows the flaw of democracy. but i still endorse what ccp is doing with the csm and since this is the first time anything like this has been done before it is understandable that there will be some bumps along the way trying to get it right. i only hope that ccp will create a better venue for the player base to both see each candidate's list of ideas/issues and to vote for the candidate they feel best represents them. i can honestly say that i did not vote in the first two csm's because of the difficulty to accurately find information on the candidates.edit: time of 9/0 vote"
1/27/2010,"just for the sake of argument, and 'food for thought', what if the csm wasn't a democratic system but a form of isocrazy. (a system where every individual has equal ruling power) this would play itself out (in theory) as follows:through a series of questions, issues raised, surveys, etc. available from inside the game every player can voice his/her opinion and the results go directly to ccp's analists, bypassing a councel. this makes the whole councel absolete, and the only data available to ccp would be scientific data. the only people analyzing the data would be people with phd's in statistics and whathaveyou.any player can create a survey question, and any player can answer survey questions. the analists pass on the survey results to ccp's game designers and they figure out how to turn that into game adjustments.in that system there's very little room for corruption, and the 'tyrany of the majority' doesn't apply either because game designers have the final call, not the majority.your thoughts?"
1/27/2010,"sounds an awful lot like ""design-by-committee"". i don't know if you've ever been down that road, but it's not pretty."
1/27/2010,"not really what i ment. it's not like majority rules, in the end the game designers make all the game design desissions, it's just that the filtering system between the players and ccp is less corrupt this way."
1/27/2010,"we need a csm that's accountable for there actions...no csm is worse.current csm ""system"" is an insult but its better than nothing."
1/27/2010,"i think some accountability could improve the current system, but how do you execute it?"
1/27/2010,if i knew the answer to that question i'd come up with it.for starters... these cannidates only get in with there massive alliance posse's backing them.not all csm's are elected this way... but anyone in goonswarm... pl.... or any other others... are likely to win either way.so player participation is a big problem as a result.but who keeps csm in check when they go about there business?don't know how to solve that problem.and that's just the tip of the iceberg.
1/27/2010,"i had a thought as i was buying nanite repair paste, and thought i would put it in the assembly corner, and hopefully might get some support.simply put, nanite repair paste blueprints on the market.players would then be able to produce it themselves, and use it, sell it in stations npcs don't seem to be seeding it in.i go through a bit of repair paste now and again, and it's a pain having to pay the prices the npcs are asking (when buying in bulk)"
1/27/2010,"it is a good idea, but the prices are the hight they are for a reason, ccp wants it to be more expensive to repair while your flying then if you dock and pay for it at a repair station, i don't agree with it myself because i use the stuff a fair amount, so i will happily sign this petition. daco"
1/27/2010,it's an intended isk sink just like station repairs in npc stations.
1/27/2010,"i use missiles, so the signature radius of targets is a huge part of a my tactical gameplay, in both pve and pvp.however, i currently have to guess the effect of mwd bloom, target painters etc when choosing targets as the sig radius of a target cannot be shown in the overview. which seems very odd for a core concept, especially one which seems to require very limited work to implement.proposal: the overview should gain a new optional column, showing the sig radius of the selected object."
1/27/2010,"haha, no, that would not be op-yes!!!!!gimmeh!"
1/27/2010,there is. it's called 'size' funnily enough.derp.
1/27/2010,i've heard that only showed the base signature radius of the hull that you're looking at? i'm not sure since i've never used it since there are more pressing things for me to have on my overview than sig radius
1/27/2010,"incorrect. 'size' is the base size of the hull, it doesn't change and isn't the signature radius i was looking for. in fact, it's not even useful a rough guide to the sig radius."
1/27/2010,"serious question: why would this be overpowered? it's showing me something clearly (gameplay) that i can infer anyway, but in a clumsy fashion. it doesn't directly boost damage, or let me know it's safe to engage, cf ship scanners. this isn't analogous to seeing, eg, cap levels or something else internal. compare to seeing target velocity, which also affects missile damage and might change what tactics i use.at low skills levels/experience playing it's difficult to determine why some targets are effectively damaged, and some aren't. this simply lets me know how much my tp is helping for example (or if it's even hitting). turrets can see range & velocity, missiles can only see one part of their damage equation inputs.alternate: i'd like the icons on the tactical overlay to be tactical, with sized circles/spheres according to sig radius."
1/27/2010,i apologise then. they must have changed it recently.
1/27/2010,"...or i might be wrong? anyone know for sure? the 'size' is invariant, even on missions where velocity & target dmg suggest mwd bloom. which is why i'm assuming it's a base size. and my pvp is too chaotic to say one way or another from that.(note to self, experiment with corp mate soon to test this.)"
1/27/2010,"topic is fairly self explanatory. ive seen a few of these threads pop up, but usually centered around being able to inject skills before you meet the pre-reqs.what im saying is to be able to put a skillbook you have into your training queue without injecting the skill itself (obviously you'll need the pre-reqs in the queue already), and when the queue comes across the new skill, it will auto inject it and continue training. saves you from the hassle of having to get up in the middle of the night to inject and train your next skill."
1/27/2010,in before the trolls start threatening to change queue back to the way it was.your variation of the proposal was suggested as well so supported.
1/27/2010,"dont be such a perfectionistput ""capital ships"" skill on 5 at the end of the queue and inject the new one when you get online next timeyour post is the same as everyone elses, injecting before prereqs are metand has a lot of problems like... where is the actual skillbok at a given time, what if you remove a prereq from the middle of the queue etc...actualy what if you do anything in relation to the location of the skillbok or anything in relation to the prereqs wich are not trainedalso, support because i would like someone else to figure out and solve all the problems so i can inject skills without prereqs and add them to queue"
1/27/2010,"when the queue reaches the desired auto-injection time, it will check for the skillbook in your hangar so all u have to do is stay docked with the appropriate skillbook(s) to inject. if it's not there, it won't inject and the queue will pause. and if u screw with the queue in any way, it will not auto-inject if your new queue list does not allow it to. just like trying to remove lvl 4 x skill before lvl 5 x skill. simple as that."
1/27/2010,and if i live in 0.0 and im not docked in a station?
1/27/2010,could be simplified further to only check the ships hold- or check both ship hold and station hanger.i like this proposal- though its unneeded. but it the ocd kids absolutely have to have it- its better then the inject any book w/o prereq proposals we usually get.im meeting you halfway you dirty hippies!
1/27/2010,while i would like this feature i would prefer ccp spent their time in other areas. not supported.
1/27/2010,way to blow away the efforts of skill queue improvements.not supporting removing the human factor.allow injection within queue time? yes.auto injection at end of the queue? hell no.
1/27/2010,"this is 100% what i had in mind.as for living in 0.0 and not being docked, well then either take it from the ships cargo as others suggested, or just have it not work (since i dont think you can inject skills from cargo, not really sure though, i dont tend to try and inject skills from my ships cargo)either way, the whole idea of the skill queue was to prevent the need of getting up in the middle of the night to change skills (at least thats the impression i got) and with new characters and people like me who are pedantic about skill training, learning skills in the proper order, then needing to inject rank 3 learning skills means exactly that. also, it'd be nice not to have to come online, wait for a skill to finish, then inject and start training the new skill on the spot. 24 hour window is nicer.as for what happens if the skillbook isnt present, id say skip it and go to the next skill instead of pausing"
1/27/2010,"this.it's eve online, not afk online. play the game."
1/27/2010,"you say that like skill training is the whole game.i still play the game, i pew pew. but i dont wanna get up early/stay up late to inject that skill"
1/27/2010,"'cause every high sec miner, autopiloter, and docker must be dual-boxing, right? u want a grindfest that keeps everyone glued to their screen 24/7 to play to train/lvl? go back to world of warcraft."
1/27/2010,"i agree with the above. if injecting a new skill is that important, and i'll be asleep or at work for eight hours, invest that time in a less important skill for that tiny amount of time. geez, it's a game!"
1/27/2010,wtf is your problem? i live in 0.0 quite comfortably.... my only complaint is its not as convenient in high sec.... but i don't have any issues with skill training.get off your lazy arse and actually play the game... stop ruining it for the rest of us.there are these really handy tools like evemon and evehq to tell me when the skill queue changes are coming up.you people are utterly helpless aren't you?are you such an ocd/addict that you have to get on right at the end of the training queue?seriously? you people need help.i have a full 24 hours notice.... plenty of time to get that skill injected and trained.what is the deal here? how about a bit more thinking and less complaining.wow is that way
1/27/2010,"1. wtf is my problem? wtf is with that tone of yours when it's just uncalled for?2. how r we ruining it for the rest of u? what difference would it make to your end if we had log on to inject? we log on, inject, log off. again, how r we ruining it for the rest of u? poor baby. in fact, just logging on would add to the server cluster so what u want is to crowd it even more. if anything, u're the one who wants to ruin it for the rest of us. 3. (edit) so we're utterly helpless ocd addicts when u're the one who needs add-ons to keep track of your 24-hour notice, which is still plenty of time for u? i wonder if i can sig all of that.4. what is the deal here? how about a bit more thinking and less complaining.5. if u wanna go back to wow, where u value effort so much and going afk gets u nothing, go ahead. just don't try to drag us with u."
1/27/2010,"o_o i think this is the first time i've been told to gbtwow.i'm not entirely sure how injecting your skills constitutes a 24/7... err... 23/7 dualboxed grindfest. if it takes you that much work to inject a skill, i suggest taking the time to master the interface. it shouldn't take you more than a few seconds to right click -> inject skill. if it's taking you hours, you've got bigger issues than i can help you with. the point is, the game already caters to an afk playstyle. the skill queue was introduced because sometime changing your skill was just entirely inconvenient (most of us have jobs, lives, sleep, etc.), and it was affecting everyone's ability to manage their skills - not to accommodate automated training."
1/27/2010,"agreed...eve online is for mature players.... people who take the time to enjoy the game and master it.not for kiddies who want to push the ""i win button"" and then go off and do something else.i've pioneered (if not 2nd) the skill queue changes way back when csm was in its 2nd term.... and i never ever wanted it to be ""automated"" to that degree.if you (not ""u"") bothered to read my post you'd see that you get a full 24 hours to log in and change your skills.if your in high sec you have literally no excuse.if you live in 0.0... jump clone down and pick up your skill and log off since your too damn busy to play the game anyway.if u cnt fgur out hw to ply th3 g4m3 then don't bother come crying to us."
1/27/2010,"if i want to train research project management, and i'm finishing research, level 5, and thats the last skill i need, and it finishes as i'm arriving at work, all the notice in the world isn't going to help.no matter what, you can't set up the queue for skills you don't meet the prereqs for. instead of spouting the crap you did (and i've read your posts, they're usually not this uninformed and ignorant), then you'd know that this is what the op was talking about. the op isn't asking for a longer queue, or for the game to auto-start training at the end of the queue. the op is merely asking for one simple fix. at the exact moment you finish the prerequisites for a skill that you ahppen to not be online to inject, if the game could help you out, as there is currently no way to set up a skill that you are freshly meeting the prereqs for if you aren't online at the very moment the previous skill finishes."
1/27/2010,"1. it doesn't. u said it's not afk online and to play the game, which gave the impression that u only want active players playing the game. that's why u could go back to wow because unless u're active in wow, u get nowhere.2. did u ever realize that convenience and accomodating automated training is one and the same?1. no--eve is a sandbox and it's for everyone who enjoys it however they want, even if they want to take it in moderation. if it was only for ppl who spend assloads of time every single day, there would be a minimum playtime requirement, but there isn't. and what's this ""i win"" button u're talking about? 'cause i don't recall any high skillpoint char roflstomping a blob by themselves.2. u don't want improvements because u don't want anyone else to enjoy eve but u--u think eve should only cater to ppl like u who have nothing important to do with their time. and it is an improvement because u have not once stated how it would hurt anyone's gameplay in any possible way, including yours.3. yes, i've read that part more than once but u also said u still needed add-ons to keep track of the queue.4. so once again, if i were to log on, inject, and log off, how am i ruining your gameplay? for someone who wants to nitpick ""you/u"", u sure like to ignore the important points.5. if someone couldn't figure out how to play a game, he would not continue his subscription to continue playing. no one has to play 24/7 just to learn the game...well, maybe u do..."
1/27/2010,for someone who thinks i'm uninformed and ignorant... you obviously don't read whats put in front of you.i don't have a problem with injecting skills that are going to qualify upon training the preq within the queue.i have a problem with making the entire process automatic to the point where you can afk the damn thing to death.if i have a queue opening up and i can't train the said skill until the one finishes... i should be able to tack it to the end of the skill.i do not want that to be automatic.... it's not my problem your work schedule prevents you from playing a game.for crying out loud people... your like a bunch of whiny babies.ccp won't allow that.... think about it before you start flaming me.what's next? automatic purchasing of skills? leveling up?sounds like wow to me!this is eve online... deal with it.tldr - inject skills that meet prereqs when current skill being trained will finish within 24hrs? yesautomate the abovementioned idea? hell no!stop whining... stop being lazy... stop afk-ing and go play the game.
1/27/2010,"*facepalm* not touchin this one. you're ******ed for making assumptions.they didn't add the skill queue for 'convenience'. they added it because people were losing training time to circumstances they could not control. training time is what people are paying for. your not losing training time without an auto-inject feature.agreed. eve doesn't take 'assloads' of time (metric, standard or otherwise) to master, but it takes involvement. minimum requirement? wtf? and you expect the rest of us to accommodate you and your ""gimme gimme"" playstyle? sounds an awful lot like ""pot and kettle"" syndrome. we don't want improvements because we don't want anyone to enjoy eve? think about that for a minute. rationally. take more than a minute if you have to. any automation tends accommodated afk playstyles. read that as macroers, farmers, etc. the fact that you have an ""inject skill"" button is an automated process that you should be happy with. how hard is it really to train that skill?is this a necessary feature? no. there are mechanics within the game that accommodate this. you can train quite another till you get home - i'm sure that you've got more than one skill you need to train.what addons do you need? no third party application is required to keep track of your skills. evemon is just a tool to help you organize and plan, not a required interface for keeping track of your skill queue. you're attempting to hijack dev time for irrelevant crap and you haven't spent the time to think about the widespread implications. character farming would be easier, macro creation, things of that nature. how is requiring people to log in and inject their skills impeding them from learning the game? this game should require some sort of active involvement. we're not asking people to dedicate their lives to this - just to check in once in a while. if it took you 23/7 to learn the game, then my heart goes out to you. i don't even wanna know what it took for you to learn to tie your shoes if that's the case.who's playing 24/7? nobody is implying this. it takes literally 2 seconds to inject a skill. before it took closer to 15 seconds. real back-breaker there. edit: apparently my attention deficit wasn't letting me finish sentences."
1/27/2010,"the first paragraph of your response have been gone over to death. for whatever reason, it has been argued down repeatedly that injecting skills you don't meet the prerequisites for is a bad idea. just check the last 300 topics about this subject.the op isn't proposing anything blatantly automated. in fact, i daresay his method takes more involvement. with yours, you might as well buy any skill you ever plan on training and inject them, allowing you to set up your skill queue hwever you want. personally, i don't see a problem with this, but the idea has, again, been shot down so many times in the past i'm not going to bother rehashing it here.the op suggests that you be able to queue up those skills for which you will meet the prerequisite, just as your ""inject unqualified skills"" idea does. the ops idea, however, requires involvement in the terms of setting up the skill queue to finish your prerequisites (within 24 hours, since that is what the queue allows), having found and placed the desired soon-to-be-qualified skill at the end of the queue, and finally, to have the required skill book in your possesssion (hold or current hangar, since you can inject from cargo hold). it actually ends up more complicated than simply injecting skills ahead of time, as it takes that player involvement that you desire.lastly, i do apologize for the ""uninformed and ignorant"" comment, and realize that an insult is not a good start to a civil discussion. regardless your attitude towards my reasoning with this issue, i do hope you accept my apology for the aforementioned comment, as i believe it was just a misunderstanding of your post."
1/27/2010,"first off... read the op's proposal again.. i even bolded the bit that clearly says he wants it automatic.... it just begs the question at best.secondly... i apologize from my crass statements... and i can respect your position in that context.thirdly... your wrong about the idea (as far as my idea goes) being shot down... it was carried up to the csm (2nd or 3rd? not sure)... passed...and then presented to ccp directly.as to whether ccp approved it or not... good luck getting that out of the csm... laughable as they are.as to my idea... allow me to specifically detail it here.--------------------if you have a skill your training up.... say minmatar frigates v.... and you wish to train assault ships (frigates) within the 24 hour queue... provided all pre-reqs are met... you can buy the book... and inject it...if you change your skill queue plan before the new skill you just injected triggers... you lose the skill book you injected permanently to prevent abuse. and thus have to buy it again... much like an implant.pros - it's only a wee bit easier to plan your skills out... and requires human interaction without going totally afk. you still have to buy your books... ship them with you until the 24 hour window opens up.cons - you miss the 24 hour window... you can only blame yourself. in reality its no different then what we have now... just assumes your going to meet the requirements within the window. coding wise its just a series of if then else's. and the ""i accidentally the titan skill"" scenario would make one scream in utter terror.---------------------automating that process is wrong... it would allow them to line up a series of books and just run off and not bother playing the game for prolonged period of time. this would also increase char farming.... rmt's and other nasty things.so while you may think i'm a raving lunatic [coughtrollcough] i have my reasons."
1/27/2010,"u still don't get it--the accomodation for circumstances beyond ppl's control is convenience. and u do lose training time when the next skill u're training can't be injected when u're not at the comp. not everyone's gonna be rdy at their comp to inject when the time comes because they don't have such a free schedule as u do. if anyone's ******ed for assuming, it's u.that's the point i was trying to make, which refutes:""not for kiddies who want to push the ""i win button"" and then go off and do something else.""so we all agree that u have to play the game to be good at it right? it's not like this new system is gonna make anyone a better player automatically, since i'm sure u'll agree that skill training is not an ""i win"" button. it's all for the sake of convenience for when real life calls. is it that hard to understand? oh i'm sry. am i asking too much when i pay the exact same amount of real life money as u do? and i'm not the only one asking for this either--keep that in mind.1. the difference is we do not generate isk by afk skill training alone. if we did, u'd be lumping yourself as a macroer, farmer, etc.2. again with complacency. would u like every single aspect of eve to be left the way it is after looking at every single thread on this board as well?3. it's not hard at all but answer this: can u reach that comp while u're far away from it?4. technically, everyone has more than one skill to train. question is, what good is a skill if u're never gonna use it? tell that to drake. he thinks we're ocd, add, whatever, and he's not--merely because he uses an add-on to keep track of his queue.1. is it eve related? yes? it's relevant. is this thread locked or deleted? no? it's relevant.2. char farming? wtf? and macros for what?"
1/27/2010,"supported, although i think there should be an option to turn it on/off."
1/27/2010,thumbs up to this idea.
1/27/2010,interesting...
1/27/2010,"this would be very useful, supported."

1/27/2010,"it would however be super cool and be what t3 is supposed to be, making your own 'modified' ships and mods. however there would be many issues with balancing and trading them."
1/27/2010,yay for you; they did this with t3 ships. problem solved.
1/27/2010,"a fair request considering the ease and volume of isk obtained in hisec, and he did say harder belt rats not just bigger bounties. so i say supported ! whilst requesting the 0.0 standard of rats be placed in lowsec.good idea"
1/27/2010,"this is why you can do combat sites and scan other types of combat sites. the fact that finding a 3 bs rat group in a belt is so damn easy to find and kill, it pretty much deserves it's current rate of isk income. combat sites like sanctums and 6/10, 10/10 plexes do have a lot more income and are significantly harder than belt ratting and most if not all lvl 4s, heck lvl 4s are ez mode now a days, running a sanctum you at least have to remember to have a tank."
1/27/2010,not supported.
1/27/2010,"definitely support this. as someone that likes to keep the assets clean, getting another rookie ship everytime i jc or hop to another station in a pod is extremely annoying. really wish this had been implemented ages ago, but sometime in the future works too."
1/27/2010,supported.
1/27/2010,exactly.
1/27/2010,1) disallow logging out in supercapital ships. once built they remain in-game at all times occupied or not.2) improve security of supercapital ships so that while not occupied they have at least a reasonable measure of security.point 1 is to address the concern that there are too many supercaps out there. as they are effectively mobile stations and cannot dock then they should never be able to leave the game. currently 'garage alts' are the common way of storing them - just log out and make them invisible and completely invulnerable when not in use. this makes them too easy to secure and contributes to their proliferation as they need no defenses while not in use and are completely invulnerable.point 2 is to address that if these ships must remain in the game they should not be so ridiculously simple to walk off with. there are many ways that this could be done. better pos security options would be one way.altering 'bumping' to not be such a ridiculous tactic would be another. allowing cap ships to anchor when not in use would be yet another. allowing passwords on ships would be even yet another. (you can password a cheap can but not a multibillion isk spaceship which also has a crew of thousands? huh? makes no sense at all.)there - a proposal which limits supercap proliferation (allowing them to be targets and requiring assets to defend them when not in use rather than the dirt simple 'alt wand') and which also allows those who don't like alts and believe that they are one of the mor broken things about eve to actually own these ships without either being chained to them forever or accepting completely ludicrous amounts of risk.
1/27/2010,"what happens if the pilot gets d/ced in some form? or a node crashes and the pilot can not log back in for some period of time while other pilots can(i.e. getting stuck on logging screen). even if it were to be ""anchored"" it would still be vulnerable to attack. and the ship would have to be pilotless as if the pilot were to d/c, than that would act like the character logging off. or if the character were forced to stay logged in to eve but the player was logged off from the player's computer, how would the server act when the player tried to log back in from computer since the server would believe the character was already logged in. i don't see anything like this ever being possible, just the technical things with this just wouldn't make it fair for anyone and would cause a massive amount of unreasonable loses in super capitals. what is the motivation for this idea? i do not see the need or how it is an unfair advantage to have alts login and log out in a titan when they see fit."
1/27/2010,so proposal one failed and you directly come with the next?
1/27/2010,i don't understand... you say you don't want them to be all over the place yet you want better security?not supporting until its cleared up.
1/27/2010,"all good questions. lots of possible answers most of which depend on how ccp wrote the code.if, for instance, the ship was in flight with a fleet it might send out a message to the fleet 'command failure' or some such and then another pilot could take command etc.if passwords were an option this would allow only friendly pilots to board it. other options are possible as well - that's just one way of doing it. i would hope that folks who regularly fly supercaps have relatively stable connections but dc does happen and can be caused due to lag. perhaps the ship would go 'auto' like a pos and keep firing? it does have a crew after all. of course it's possible - many things are possible. as to 'massive losses' well, folks have been complaining there are too many around. what better way to fix that than to let enemies find and kill them?some of us hate alts. <raises hand> eve is supposed to be a sandbox. a ship like a supercap is supposed to never be able to dock, which means that in any sensible rpg world it must always be somewhere in the universe. waving a magic 'go away and hide from the bad guys' wand is about as non-sandbox as you can get.and teadaze was whining that my idea of actually asking to be able to store one in universe sandbox style would lead to 'supercap proliferation'.thus, an answer to that. one i'm sure he/she won't like but an answer nonetheless."
1/27/2010,"actually i want more security only for the ships when they stay 'in game'.right now the standard 'security' is to have a garage toon that just logs out in the ship whenever it's not in use. gone from the game. invisible, entirely invulnerable, unfindable *poof*. that's vastly better than anything i'm proposing (anchoring, passwords etc.) and that's why supercap pilots like the status quo. they're pretty much all alt happy anyway having gotten all their cyno alts etc. etc. that you virtually need to play the game at that level easily. so a garage alt is no big deal to your usual supercap pilot or someone getting ready for one. most cap pilots have alts for cynos too - i think i'm the only one in my corp that actually has to get real players to light my cynos for my carrier - the others sometimes do if it's more convenient but they don't need to as they have alts on other accounts to do so if they need to jump solo.right now - those logged off supercap ships are pretty much never in game unless they're in use. it does happen, but it's very rare. they spend most of their time in logoffski land.if just improved in-world security were to be added the result wouldn't actually be more supercaps as some maintain. garage alts aren't that tough to get and they are far better than storing the ship in-game which, right now, is too risky to really do. so, before getting the ship, people buy or train a garage alt and then use that alt to log off in the ship. perfect security.teadaze and co. used the argument that any kind of improved security in-game would add to the numbers of supercaps (something i very much doubt) in unreasonable numbers. my answer to that is that, if true, counter it but making them immune to the magic alt disappearing wand.of course, that would really cause waves for supercap pilots in eve who would actually need to find real solutions for storing their ships, so i expect it won't be real popular."
1/27/2010,i'm gonna have to disagree.you gotta keep in mind these ships are bloody expensive to field... and they don't make themselves.profliferation or not.... you have a crapload of isk to deal with.with the obvious cost of running an alliance alone going up up up it's not likely going to go rampant.security is highly needed to encourage them to use them more often.you want them to get shot up? encourage them to bring them out of there little cubby holes and come out to play.this is a pickle indeed... but i don't think forcing them to stay on grid in some form or fashion won't help much.
1/27/2010,"i was told it was technically 'not a proposal' because i linked to it rather than re-typing it all in this forum.so this is just covering off that 'technicality' for teadaze.it'll still die because the non-alt position seems to be very unpopular, i expect, but i felt i had to at least try."
1/27/2010,"hey - that's fair.i know - i've been considering a nyx (i can fly one) but was told flat out that without some kind of garage alt there is simply no current way in-game for it ever to be even remotely safe. i'd be willing to work hard to build the ship/make the isk to fit it etc. if it were even reasonable to keep it at a pos someplace. sure, the enemy could launch an attack, but that's just a good reason to have a battle (not a bad thing in my book). i'm willing to take that risk - but not with the current mechanics which makes stealing them ludicrously easy. ft.c lost a rorqual to exactly such shenanigans about a year ago and the pilot who built it, while she still has an account, has almost not played since. it ripped her heart out that much.i'm with you on that. the 'on grid all the time' thing is mostly for teadaze to answer her complaints of possible proliferation. i'd be happy, nee overjoyed, with just reasonable in-game security.well, it is a lot more 'sandboxy' and would certainly shake up the major alliances some. probably more than dominion did."
1/27/2010,such witty repartee! how can i ever hope to answer such a brilliant counter-argument?
1/27/2010,the other thing is your likely going to open a can of worms.such condition are going to be applied to titans.... and potentially other capital ships.these things have a tendency to get a little out of hand.but i can at least respect your argument on the matter.and thus... i'll withdraw to my.... cave. :)
1/27/2010,"i remember a time when eve was so different.i remember a time when fight winner was not determined in the first second. when piloting was a real factor that made you a great player or not.i remember a time when gameplay did not favour kikoolols. when your skill and your ship and stuff did not make 99% of the job. when players did not runaway the battle as soon as they see there's one more ship in the ennemy fleet. i remember a time when there was not so many kikoolols in this game. when it was too difficult for them to survive cause you had to think a little about your fitting and your way of fly.i remember a time when intys gave you a real sensation of being dangerous for your ennemy, no matter the ship he has. and so much things else...i remember a time when eve direction's goal was not so much a marketing one, targeting all wow's kikollols. it was such a great time."

1/27/2010,"that's nice.it isn't all of the time. i don't see why this should be a problem.it isn't?a made up word?its called ""realistic"". so your ""one more ship"" hyperbole aside, you mean that the player base was fairly stupid and would refuse to run away on the basis of misplaced pride/""honor""?again. this would go better if you didn't use made up words. use english.you have yet to explain who this ""them"" is.we do.that sounds stupid. someone in a vastly inferior ship should not feel dangerous to someone in a vastly superior ship. and define ""intys"".then you were utterly deluded. ccp is, and has always been, a business using eve online to make money. this is the third time you've used what appears to be a gibberish word.still is."
1/27/2010,"oh yes, i think you're right on this point, and because it seems you think a bit more than the other, i may precise what i define by a kikoolol.a kikoolol is a player who uses every possible way to avoid difficulty in a game. such as engaging only the easiest target, or profiting of every non-regular situation to make himself shining. also, you could meet them on forums, they often reply to every topic, no matter if they have a pertinent and constructive reply to share."
1/27/2010,"i'm unsure what the problem is. basically, a ""kikoolol"" would seem to be an intelligent individual who is slightly critical."

1/28/2010,"forget linking them, just anchor them on the opposite side of the gates and make them their own strategic objectives for the attacker and the defender.there's three types of blockades:close - manned gatecamp, useful for denying the enemy, repairing the sbu, deployed hic/mobile warp bubble, etcdistant - staged at a pos, or other safespot, out of direct harms way, but close enough to disrupt enemy loose  designed to draw out your attacker, your fleet location might be the next system or several jumps away (think hotdrop), but within striking distance"
1/28/2010,"the idea is that people who dont follow the law get a bad standing and cant enter certain areas. people who do have nothing from it.my idea could lead into the profession of headhunter and more pvp in 0.3-0.8.tell me what you think:hmm i think some reward for a high security status is somewhat fair seeing that acting agains law cause a drop in standings.the main idea is to expand the security onto the low sec in order to see more people go to low sec.the first part which came into my mind was that a body-guard patrol is somewhat ridiculous even for us carebears. but nonetheless on a small part this could be a good idea where even our bloodthirsty pvp friends could benefit from.my idea to this would be this:every person with a sec status above 4 can attack pirates and gankers (even if their corp hasnt been targeted) like the have a sec status -5 till a sec status of the system of 0.6. on the low sec part this people get a higher security just on the gates of low sec 0.4. either the guns would have a higher power or the gates would fire as well so even a bs could not stand it longer then 15 seconds. every gun is concentrating on a different target. so for 0.4 id say gate, concord board, and 3 sentries make 5 targets.the same system would go for a sec status above 4.5. but the hunting ground expands to the system of 0.8. in low sec that would go then into 0.3 concerning gate camps and a max. tanking time for a bs of 20 secs. 4 guns aiming at different targets.beeing to much of a care bear i dont know about rewards. is a reward by destroying the pod or just the ship? if the pod, the sec status above 4 should allow to pod as well.naturally the pirates / gankers corpmembers must be only allowed to assist in 0.2 or below. or they would suffer the gate defenses.by helping concord doing this another incentive could be given out. the headhunters could gain lp which they could change into a tradeable concord insurance. basicly this tradeable insurance can be redeemed with a platinum insurance to insure a t2 ship to 75% of the value. which on the other side hulk owner might consider as a stimulation going with their ships into low sec areas or deeper. of course this makes only sense if the buyer has a certain sec status like 2.5 or above or maybe just above 0.5what are the pros imho of this? 1. a new profession would be introduced. headhunters,2. causing more pvp between the sec areas of 0.3 and 0.8 3. a bit more security against gatecamps in 0.3-0.44. more traffic into low sec 0.3-0.45. marking gankers and pirates to all players with standing of 4 and more free to shoot6. high sec areas will be more security driven by players and less by concord7. possible more miner into low sec cause of buyable additional insurance on t2 shipscons?1. pirates and gankers will have a hard time in 0.3-0.82. i dont know how long the marking of a pirate last. but id say 4-6 weeks time would be a good period. (open for ideas here)3. gate camps are mostly done by 5-9 ships. not all of them could be destroyed by concord in time. but at least it would cause discomfort replacing 4 to 5 bs after a gatecamp.i hope you consider this as an honest try to serve both sides (carebears/tearbears)."
1/28/2010,first! uh. what was that you were saying? never mind.
1/28/2010,nice spam nooblet.op - not supporting.i get what your trying to do... but you got alot of holes in your logic and no ones going to really dig that.a higher security rating gives you the ability to punish the lower sec rating or the one who decides to attack you if not pod you.the punishment for such an action (such as podding) exponentially increases when someone attacks a higher security rated pilot as opposed to a low one.don't have the maths on me... but that's how it was explained to me.as to the overall benefit?bout the only thing i could come up with as a plausible benefit would be a lower standings penalty accross empire when you **** off someone or some such missioning... or a increased standings increase for doing missions with higher sec ratings.keep in mind that its going to cause problems when it comes to people who rat up there security ratings just to get back into high sec... so if your going to propose something... you need to make the sec rating on said pilot worth more....and more costly than ever.hence why your not going to get very far without a lot of thought and effort put into this.
1/28/2010,"i heard that too. it would be interesting to see how much bigger the loss would be.hmm i am not sure if the lower standings penalty would be such a big bonus. after all if you do such things you do it more often. therefore youll never reach a standing which grants you that bonus.thats where the flag comes in. its like having a very bad standing frozen at a level which allows all other people to hunt you down. at this moment the up-ratting would be a waste cause your standing wont improve till the flag time is over. that would be the more costly price for doing pirating or ganking. most ""carebears"" are asking for an insurance loss. even ""tearbears"" have to confess that the amount of time which is needed to repair damaged security status cause of pirating or ganking is very less compared to someone who might have to replace a hulk.so instead of losing the insurance, which i now think would take some motion out of the game, this could encourage people to do pvp and take ""defense"" in their own hands cause the offending character is free to shot for everyone. the fixed flag time would even out a bit the amount of time you need to replace i.e. a hulk.the ""lame"" version would just be that depending on your sec status your insurance for t2 ships increases. so if you reach 4.5 or 5 sec status you get 95% of your hulk or transport or whatever t2 ship replaced. this could also a be a way to drive people into low/null sec. but then i have to confess that would be unfair again against people with a low sec status living in null, cause then a ""high-standing-alliance"" can more easily attack with a t2 fleet and get it replaced if loosing."
1/28/2010,"the one thing that i never understood is when someone ganks or pods someone in high security... it was always very easy to get that sec rating back up (provided you know what your doing and even then that knowledge is readily available)it's not as soul destroying as some would lead others to believe.so perhaps one way of increasing that value is not so much give a benefit but increase the penalty for attacking someone who goes to the trouble of maintaining a higher security rating.and then double if not quadruple the time required to get it back.then you run into a situation where people have to weigh the costs of committing criminal acts in the eyes of concord.top that off with the fact that you can still traverse high sec in a pod and do various things and work around concord to do your gankage.bottom line... the punishment is not high enough for people who wish to ""break the law"".many would support the removal of insurance for getting concord'd or self destructing your ship.that's a good start... but the value of sec rating is quickly becoming a very.... very trivial thing.your idea... as good intentioned as it is... won't fly. it wouldn't take much for someone to rat up the rating and become this said headhunter and cause some trouble..the metagaming alone would cause some major problems... hence the little paradox we have with bounty hunters and such.you got a lot of territory to cover before you come to a reasonable/refined idea here.keep trying... you may come up with something someone has yet to come up with.just remember to keep it balanced... high sec is supposed to be safer... not safe.also... as rampant as the suicide ganking is... there are many things you can do to make that job harder if not little to no risk to begin with.like mining in whs or 0.0... most griefers are total and utter cowards... they won't go there because they find themselves without the almighty concord to protect them.... that and getting blown up by fellow corpmates tends to have quite the effect on ones mindset.ironically there argument for depreciating the mineral market by forcing demand up is totally bogus.0.0 provides high end minerals for the high sec market.... low end is in high demand out here... with little veld to go around and such.... we need supplies pumped up here.this isn't all high sec based.... they think in micro econmomic terms and not macro... ironic.maybe they should spend a little bit of time living out in 0.0 learning how to survive in a economy that must pay costly sov. bills eh?"
1/28/2010,"i'm not entirely clear on what you're proposing here, but i don't think i like it. it smacks too much of a solution looking for a problem."
1/28/2010,"i have this idea that pop up in my mind from time to time.ships that looks old and used the longer you had them.lets say you owned a megathron or whatever ship since 2006 andhave used it alot. then it should look really used.black parts around the engines and guns, lights that dont work,some armor plates bended due to hits, paint missing in some parts, etc.maybe supported with some sort of info about owner history and ship age in shipinfo.edit: forgot to support and sorry for my post being kinda ot."

1/28/2010,"hi there.i've been missioning a fair bit and noticed that nos and neut ships don't show any icons on the overview, which can be annoying to say the least when you're in one of those mission areas where you're blinded by the surrounding light, and can't see which ship the nos beam is coming from.having nos and neuts appear on the overview the same way ecms and webs/scrams do would be a great idea imo, and i hope you'll sign and support."

1/28/2010,"voice is way too slow and inaccurate for detailed instructions.imagine trying to tell the computer which ship to target, what coordinates or direction to fly. all this while you have dozens of friendly and enemy ships buzzing around you.then add into the mix the odd names eve uses and trying to pronounce them correctly. bei is that with a long e, long i, or long a sound?i always get a chuckle at people wanting a voice interface. there are definitely niche areas where thing like speed, accuracy, and range of vocabulary aren't issues and it works ok, but generally it's not that practical."
1/28/2010,"actually it could be much easier with additional voice control especialy when you have to do a lot at once. and with defined commands it is quite accurate. to target a ship, the overview window could have numbers or ids for every entry in the list, counting from top to bottom. then you just have to call the number/id and not any random names. setting a direction could be easier without the double mouse clicks too. you could have commands like: ""turn left 45<U+FFFD>""- the ship does a turn of 45 <U+FFFD> from its original course, or ""turn up right 45<U+FFFD>-ship turns right and up. if you have a ship selected just say: ""orbit target at 500"" or ""approach target"" it would activate the buttons you have to reach and click with the mouse otherwise. if this produces too much lag, then dont use voice control in tense situations. as you say there are plenty other moments in the game where you have no time pressure, like mining, traveling or being docked in a station where you can do a lot of practical stuff with voice control"
1/28/2010,yes it would be totaly awesome to be able to control everything with voice. i could then set up other pcs that loop-back voice comms into the mic input and control whole fleets of alts with sound alone.the reason ccp doesn't allow you to bind most in-game actions to a key-press is to make macros harder to create.
1/28/2010,"the only way to fight macros, is in adding complexity to the game, not in limiting its features."
1/28/2010,i seriously hope you're wrong about that. wow's graphics were ****y when they came out and have not improved durring the years. one of the things that attracted me to eve was the graphics. i honestly thought that it was all production vids before i downloaded the client and was happily amazed.where the eve graphics fail is in having clear understandable meaning. it'd be nice to be able to tell whats going on without having to refer to the raw spreadsheet.. er... ui i mean.

1/28/2010,"no! no flavours.missiles always hit, have ridiculous range, can choose damage type to hit resist holes, can't be disrupted or jammed (fof, it sucks but a chance at hitting something is still better than hitting nothing).keep the weapons different. do not try to vanilla-lise them. i might as well suggest a guidance system jammer/ewar module that only applies to missiles. say reducing flight time and a chance at missing the target altogether?have you ever been cursed with blasters? now them boys have got it bad, while you be tearing their armour away in your raven 20-25kms away while they try to hit you ineffectuallyalthough i'll agree that rocket needs work and that all missile should have their flight time halved and their speed doubled."
1/28/2010,no. or at least not until i get missile 'tracking disruptors'missiles are not guns. guns are not missiles. it's nice that you think you can hit out to 80km with an autopest. it's positively adorable that you think he's going to do a jot of damage.missiles have great range already and will always hit anything in range. if you want to give yourself extra flight time/speed then sacrifice some rig slots.

1/28/2010,"this is true. but some damage is better than no damage. in fact... missile ships are the bane of most speed tankers.congrats, but can a rokh hit for the same damage at 250km as it can at 60km? didn't think so.derp, rof bonus is just as good, if not better than damage bonus.boy i wish i had fof ammo for my laser, hybrid and projectile weapons. you have to be pretty pro to hit missile volleys with smartbombs and outside of caps who fits them now?missiles are fine.cool story bro. a mega does less than half damage at the same range a raven does full damage.if turret users max out their support skills they get at most an extra 25% range out of their guns. if missile users max out theirs then they get 100% extra range. am i complaining? no.they are two completely different weapon systems. missiles can do some things guns can't and guns can do some things missiles can't.live with it princess."
1/28/2010,"full damage!? rofl! mega can reduce the torpedoe damage for at least 30% by just moving around. stop discussing ships you never flew.turret parametres can be modified by modules, but launchers - not. it is unhonest."

1/28/2010,if such modules gonna be created then current default range of missiles has to be lowered. and i believe you won't like it.
1/28/2010,"makes perfect sense.fitting a missile enhancer [low slot] would be a choice that probably would mean losing a bcu.fitting a missile tracking computer [middle slot] , would mean less tank or less tackle.so overall these modules would no make missiles op as many of the gun firing detractors knee jerk reactions would seem to suggest.more options for adjusting the performance of missile boats would be good.better hits against fast small stuff comes at the price of raw damage or tank.and ahem , defenders are the equiv of tracking disruptors , if you dont fit them then stop complaining , and yes they are crap so complain about getting them fixed rather than spouting we dont have missile disrupters."
1/28/2010,"supported as long as you mean 15% reduction in explosion radius and 9.5% increase in explosion speedand yes, i do think that missiles need flight time halved and velocity doubled"
1/28/2010,"not supported, see above."
1/28/2010,"can you fit a tracking disruptor on a raven? yes. can you fit defender missiles to a dominix? no.there are no missile disruptors.op - i'd support this if the existing ranges of guided and unguided missiles were nerfed commensurately. as it stands, you have to fit tes at the expense of damage mods to make blasters useful, even with null (hint: null buys range at the expense of tracking), so it's a bit hard to feel sympathy for ham/torp users who want to be able to boost their already significant range advantage."
1/28/2010,"well thats one of the issues with defenders isnt it, you need to use a missile hardpoint.they should probably have a dedicated launcher , much like the probe launchers that dont take up a missile hardpoint.back to the op and requireing a nerf to justify the extra mods is just stupid reasoning.the op is talking about fitting choices.fitting a missile enhancer means using a slot that is currently used for something else.so no nerf is needed , a player fitting a low slot missile enhancer would lose dps much like the way a gun pilot fitting a te losing dps by losing a heat sink/gyro/mag stab.there are no extra slots to fit the op requested mods."
1/28/2010,"op was saying that guns are overpowered compared to missiles because of tes, and thats why 'missile enhancers' are needed. missiles are not guns, and if you want one of the flexibility advantages of guns (ability to fit a module to change engagement profile slightly), then missiles need to be rebalanced around that.besides, there's already bay thruster rigs which provide the flight time/velocity bonus, and painters which provide the same benefit as an explosion velocity bonus (in reverse), but for everyone in your gang.seems to me that guns and missiles are balanced, just different."
1/28/2010,"rigs are neither here nor there , there are plenty of choices in rigs for both guns and missiles.painters effect the sig radius stat of the enemy ship , they have no effect on explosion velocity which is the missile equiv of tracking.there would be no need for missile rebalncing because were talking about choices made at fitting time.explosion vcelocity can be improved with this mods, but something has to be given away at fitting time thats where the rebalancing occurs."
1/28/2010,"derp, it helps to catch them first. many a time i've engaged a competant cruise raven or hml drake in my vaga and had to fly away whereas turret ships would have been ineffectually missing me all day.just pulled up eft. all level 5. raven with 3 damage mods and faction cruise: 518 dps@253krokh with 425mm ii and 3 damage mods: 553 dps@ 54+ 30 320 dps at 194+30. hardly a bit less and the raven still has 2 utility highs/turret slots and a bigger drone bay.i see plenty of sacs. it's just that most amarr players haven't trained missiles and the zealot has more utility in a lot of snipe hac gangs (hence you also see more eagles than cerbs, get over it). i don't really see what your point is. yes some other ships have missiles as their secondary weapon system and recieve an approapriate bonus to it. as i said, 5% rof bonus gives you more dps than a 5% damage bonus.actually kiddo you can check my killboard. i've probably lost more missile ships than you've had hot dinners.irrelevant. turrets won't hit a moving target with transversal as well or even at all. turrets can also 'glance' a target for less damage. boost turrets!so do you."
1/28/2010,"no. missiles are not turrets, and turrets are not missiles. they need to be distinct. i agree that some missile types, especially roflkets, need an overhaul, and perhaps do more paper dps than turrets at the cost of not applying full damage to your typical target without webbing and target painting. this, however, is not the way to do it."
1/28/2010,"lol! that's defenetly a point... bs > hac, bc > hac. problem is not in missiles, it's still fitting. oh wait, is there something missing on rokh ?? damage bonus! comparing to +5% rof on raven...checked others ?? apoc having 700dps on 60km and 400 at 200 ?? exactly... there is no point in training missile line just for one ship... there must be real reason for that. yes, coz cerbs are inferior comparing to eagle in terms of long range shooting. and people use mostly more effective ships.point is that most of caldari missile ships have kinetic damage bonus, not rof. yes, rof is better, i agree, give caldari rof bonus instead of kineticchecked. 0 kills 1 pod loss. sure. learn to control your ship to affect transversal, not just press f1 f2 f3."
1/28/2010,"the only module i would support is improvement to explosion radius and maybe flight speed, however stats yoy are suggesting are rediculously broken. that would result in increasing missile range by 50%. can i please have a magic nuke that kills people from the different end of a solar system?"
1/28/2010,"regardless, missile ships are much better suited to driving off speed tanked ships. i was just throwing that out as an example.raven has 7.5 effective missile launchers, rokh has 8 effective turrets, i don't see the issue.as for lazors. well, they are in need of a bit of a nerf imho but also eat up cap, regardless that 400 dps at 200 km is still less than the raven and nobody fits 8 tach apocs anyway.it's not that their's no point. people have the option and plenty take it. it's just that 'traditionally' missile skills and amarr don't go well together. qq more.baww? range on the cerb is a non issue for a start. seeing as you are not advocating instant hit missiles i think we'll let your obvious statement pass. there are plenty of occassions where you would fly a cerb over an eagle.most do and kinetic is one of the better damages to have a bonus on. it's a bone of contention of mine though and not the issue at hand.hi, you must be new around here.yes, you go ahead and do that."
1/28/2010,"and turret deal instant damage on range. i can live with both.more lolz. if you don't fit them, dosn't mean noone does. all i see is you qqing. with no thinking out of straight lines. sad.no, i won't. flyed all hacs, and cerb is last in line i would take into combat.no it's not."
1/28/2010,"rokh is the worst sniper ship in eve regardless of it ""overgrid"" fire range.about 400dps at 250 kilometres: missile speed is 7850m/s, so it will take 32 seconds to deliver 2900 points of damage.lets take a spherical battle where apoc fighting against raven at 190km snipe-range.raven: 190000/7850=24.2seconds to deliver first 2900 damage.apoc has instant damage delivery, so we dividing raven's delivery time with rof and multiplying with volley damage: 24.2/7.31*2287=7571.2and, just to make clear that caldari sucks, we bring here the rokh: 24.2/5.86*1597=6595 (15% less damage, 25% less tracking speed than apoc at the same range)all three battleships have 2 damage mods and 190km optimal range, skills are ""all-v"".at last you can see that turret platform has at least 3700 points of damage leg-up against missile boats at 190km range.if there will be ten ravens against 10 apocs at 190km range, then three of them will pop before their missiles will reach the target.so shut up all of you whining that missiles must be left intact."
1/28/2010,all very good. now compare 10 torp ravens to 10 megapulse apocs at 10km and the situation is very different.horses for courses. caldari have a long range option for bs slug fests (two in fact). if you are unhappy with the performance of rails then train lasers or projectiles. it's that simple.
1/28/2010,support this topic
1/28/2010,"this.well yeah, missiles make crappy sniper ships. nobody is disputing that. i hear that if you put up 10 apocs against 10 charons, you can really massacre caldari ships. thing is, what you propose wouldn't actually change any of this in any way. so, um...good for you?"
1/28/2010,"current situation: there are three kinds of missile battery for pos defence - cruise, torp, and citadel torp. citadel cruise have been added to the game, but do not have a pos defence associated with them. instead, citadel torp batteries have a x12 range multiplier to serve in the ranged role. proposed solution: recreate the citadel cruise/citadel torp split for pos defences. add a citadel cruise battery module to provide long-ranged missile firepower for pos towers. remove some of the range bonuses from the citadel torpedo battery(probably drop it down to x2 velocity and nothing else), and increase its dps. ensure that both are actually balanced against their turret counterparts when you do this - either remove their cpu need, or give them stats good enough to justify it. if you can work in a change that makes normal cruise/torp batteries not laughably bad, that'd be nice too. benefits: allows better choice of defences on pos towers. also, it'd be more internally consistent. drawbacks: as long as they're made to be actually usable, none. if they're still jokes after the change, ccp will be wasting their time on a module that no smart people will be using."

1/28/2010,"there's a reason i asked that they get a very serious buff in the process. you realize that's a really terrible fit, right? each cruise missile battery does 17 dps, even after the tower's bonus. you can get 50% more dps out of beams, even on a caldari tower, for less pg and no cpu. cruise batteries are a special kind of bad."
1/28/2010,the lag alone would be bad enough.
1/28/2010,"not to mention the extreme amount of gunners you'd need to man the tower...give them a buff and remove the cpu req (maybe at the price of increasing grid, would depend on how much you buff them) and then do this, if you won't do that this change will indeed be a waste of developer time"
1/28/2010,"supporting the original proposal and suggest adding rethink/rework pos missile batteries in general.maybe this could be another caldari tower bonus, 100% reduction on cpu so missiles can actually be used after the tower comes out of rf.more variety is good and missiles are not exactly worth the cpu as they stand."

1/28/2010,"not really bro. i liked your previous edit better. you can throw my previous little 'indiscretion' at me until you're blue in the face. i don't care. i regret doing what i did, i was punished, that's that. i even found some amusement in the emo rage that was generated. afaik nobody died and ccp didn't lose any subscribers due to csm dissillusion, if anything it was probably the opposite. no publicity is bad publicity right?"
1/28/2010,"from my perspective (and this is, of course, purely opinion) an 'alt' is any character who acts primarily as a subsidiary in some way for your main, regardless of what account it may be attached to. so different from the definition you would use. (that doesn't make yours 'wrong' i'm just explaining what i mean when i use the term).i have another character on my account, for instance, but he has nothing to do with my main. i flew him for awhile until i realized that i couldn't train him (he was created expressly to play around in fw), briefly considered another account for him so he could train and then had to be sensible about my real world time committments and simply shelved him. i don't have anything like the time i want to fly my main character and i certainly don't have the time for another one at least right now.the real world is a pain sometimes."
1/28/2010,"it is possible, yes. and for some players it might even be enjoyable - but i suspect very very very few. few enough that, for most intents and purposes, it's closer to jumping out of a plane without a chute than it is to, say, painting your house green instead of white.this is a game. one is supposed to enjoy it. one is also (according to ccp) be able to play it completely without alts. perhaps this meets your litmus test for playing without alts but, given that it would make doing something that i'm doing for fun rather un-fun, it does not meet mine.i don't think i'll bother with the reply i'd originally written for that. suffice to say that i am entirely unconcerned about your ability to eat anything more complex than grass."

1/28/2010,if being locked in a supercap all day doesn't meet your definition of fun then don't do it. you are still able to play the game 'completely' from within your floating death palace with one or two exceptions.i can think of a couple of dozen things to do in the game which other people find fun without the use of alts or even in general but i most certainly wouldn't. does that mean i should lobby for each of those facets to be changed so that i find each particular facet fully enjoyable on my own? no it doesn't.
1/28/2010,"oh it's far more than one or two exceptions. i could list them all, but i'd run out of characters. i'll just list a few:1) mission in empire2) visit my research agents3) fly anything that doesn't move like an iron bathtub filled with neutronium4) go on roams with my corp5) compete in frig tournaments (or, for that matter any kind of tournament)6) run smuggling missions in my blockade runner7) for that matter fly any of my other ships (which number a few dozen at a guess without counting)as i have said, i could go on. reality is that i could rat, do limited plexes (those without accel gates) and fight in fleet battles occasionally. i couldn't even do market stuff without assistance as i couldn't dock. i'd even need someone to bring me ammo.you realize you wrote that badly right?this is probably not the place to debate the to alt or not to alt for the game as a whole - that discussion is long and never-ending.ccp says you can play the game without alts. i say that if you own a supercap, no you can't. you disagree. fine. neither of us is going to convince the other."

1/28/2010,"ok, i'm probably just going to get ripped to shreds here, but i'll throw this idea out here:-new sov upgrade: supercapital anchoring relay (probably strat 3 or 4)-new fuel bay on titans/sc's/whatever the hell else they make later: anchoring fuel bay-new menu option for above ships: anchor for self/anchor for corpyou fly it to an unoccupied moon, anchor it, and it effectively becomes a tower (exact numbers to be determined) without guns. i'm not sure whether/how much of a reinforced timer would be a good idea, so i leave that to wiser minds. i've left the details a little vague here, because i'd rather the solid numbers come from someone with more large alliance experience.if you want to get really evil about it, make it so that supercaps don't ever disappear when you log out, but that might be overkill."
1/28/2010,"i would make it so that they have to be left at poses or cloacked in deep safespot, otherwise they stay hovering in space when you log off. you should be able to leave it at a pos with it being impossible to bump away. can't see makiing supercap vulnerable as anything bad, as opposed to have it vanish."
1/28/2010,"things on that list i also can't do if i choose to be a -10 pirate1) mission in empire2) visit my research agents in empirei could also add other restrictions, but it basically boils down to large areas of space being off limits.now, if you can't see the similarity here and are going to spout the ""but you can use an alt"" line then you are invalidating your own argument. it is completely possible to live as a -10 pirate without any alts but it is just a bit harder.let me break it down to the level you might understandif you choose to be -10 (or join factional warfare), you can't do certain things in game even if you park your ship in lowsec/fw friendly space. we agree on that correct?if you choose to be in a supercap you can't do certain things in game but you can choose to park the ship at a pos. we agree on that correct?your answer to point one was ""people use alts to get round it"". well that is true for many people but they are not forced to just as they are not forced to become -10. some do, their choice.your answer to point two is to complain that ccp are forcing you to get an alt to get round it or risk leaving the ship at a pos where some nasty thief in your corp will nick it. again you are not forced to get an alt but some people choose to. you could also join a more trustworthy corp now those two arguments are exactly analogous, with the one exception that if you choose to be -10 you are restricted far more than you are if you decide to get into a super cap specifically because you have the option to park a supercap at a pos (with the risk that have to trust the people with pos access).i agree that you can play the game without alts. i choose to have alts because i can and i don't have any issue with them.you haven't proven you can't play without alts nor have you proven ccp are forcing you to. all you have proven is that some people can use alts to avoid the issue you would have due to your position on alts.i'm also glad you've written off the csm because two of the members publicly (and one more privately) think the current supercap system is fair. please feel free to ignore the hours of debate on other (better supported by the playerbase) issues.i've attempted to discuss my position with logic and politeness and in return i get abuse and claims i don't play the game . i play the game enough to know how unbalancing unrestricted supercap ownership would be. yes some people choose to use an alt to make it less difficult but that is a choice not required or enforced.well i will say no more on this issue unless you feel the need to attack me again or it crosses the csm agenda - but you already know i won't support it..."
1/28/2010,"this is, to be honest, diverting the argument somewhat away from the realities of capital ships etc. and into other things about using alts to get around penalties.we could go there, but i expect that we wouldn't agree on that either. one of my main reasons for disliking alts is that they do let you get around the penalties of being a pirate etc. much too easily. in fact, so easily that the 'penalties' are largely a joke and have little real in-game meaning at all.even if you were a -10 pirate and didn't use alts (which is how i will play it if i ever decide to play that aspect of eve) it's nowhere near as limiting as supercaps. not even close.no, and that's the heart of the argument. parking a supercap at a pos, with the current rules set, is not a realistic option - which is why it's almost never done. they are so valuable and so easy to steal at present that it just isn't do-able.which is the point of the proposal - make it do-able. not with perfect safety (i've never asked that by any means) but with a more sensible level of risk. come now - that's straw man. any active corp of any size (like, say, one that could support characters with supercaps) cannot be trustworthy enough in the current rules set. it's simply too big. anything over about five or six real humans and it's too big. all corps recruit etc. (if they are healthy) and all it takes is one character in the corp for even a few days and *poof* no more supercap. the character could have a stellar background etc. and just have been purchased etc. by an enemy player just to infiltrate. real life vetting is basically not possible.our corp is not huge. maybe 20-30 real humans active at any one time yet we lost a rorqual last year to exactly this and we were smaller then. the person had no permissions at all other than being able to enter the pos shields. one quiet night his allies showed up. bump bump, bye bye rorqual. the ships in the ship array were fine because they had no access to it (including some capital ships).if this were true, we wouldn't be having this conversation. the limitations are much more extreme in the one case which makes them not exactly analogous at all.the reality is - with the current rules as they are - that pos access is just too risky. if we had better pos security options, i'd be cool with that. if we had the ability to anchor (to prevent bumping) i'd be cool with that. you don't seem to want to admit it but it comes to this - leave your supercap at a pos and it's gone in 60 seconds. okay - maybe a month, but you won't have it very long at all.i believe i've adequately proven you cannot own a supercap without alts and still meaningfully play the game. it's you who haven't proven your position that it can in any way be safely 'parked'. you were the one who started with the condescending attitude, not i. that's what got you written off. disagreement is fine but talking down to people and not even intelligently discussing their points will get you dismissed every time. and so it should."
1/28/2010,"no, it is purely me pointing out (as i have done a few times now) that there are many other things in game that require you to live with the decisions you make. one such decision being supercap ownership which comes with the disadvantage of not being able to dock it.but you are not forced to use alts, which is the point i have been trying to put to you. if you want to play ""pure"" and not have an alt you can. is it as easy, no - i never said it was.no, you have just shown it is harder without an alt but not proved it isn't possible.i don't have to prove it can or can't be safely parked, all i had to do was disprove your lie that ccp force people to use alts. it is perfectly possible to own a supercap and keep it safe by sitting in it. like other things in game (as i've again proven above) you have restrictions placed upon you. yes people can use alts to get round it but that is their choice. many supercap pilots remain in them at all times just as many of them use alts to park them.you can park it empty at a pos but there is risk doing so.you are the one who wants to raise a proposal to change the game, you instead complained that ccp were forcing you to use alts.excuse me?i take exception to this because i have been polite at all stages. if you took offence from me saying:then that was simply me pointing out you should have actually read how the csm procedure works in the first place.you wrote me off for statinganyone looking at my posting history in this thread, other threads, the csm meetings and in game would see i support my opinion with reasonable debate. i fail to see where i have not done so here, perhaps you would like to point to something that means my statements should be dismissed every time?and you were the one who accused me of not playing eve and in your other thread that i ""whined about x"" when i did no such thing, i simply pointed out the drawbacks and issues. if your argument was sound you wouldn't need to resort to mud slinging at me or the other csm members..."
1/28/2010,"apocrypha made this subject redundant last year. people now have a choice: if you don't want local, go live in a wormhole./ben"
1/28/2010,fixed
1/28/2010,im a miner who likes wh space and the way it works the removal of me and my stats in local is good imo as it means the players who manage to get past our wh guards still got to try and track me down before i can get back to the pos what i would suggest is to create a decent tool for gathering info is quite easy we already have it the directional scanner in wh space if i spot an unknown ship on directional then i run for safe spot just make it that you can preset the directional with an automatic cycle rather than having to constantly press the button and if your not paying attention to directional and get ganked well only got yourself to blame as for the cloaked ships the gankers are not the only ones with cov ops ships we usually have several close by to our mining ships to quickly lock down anyone who tries to gank the miners/industrials and have caught plenty or cov ops and t3 ships using this tactic so i support removal of me being in local
1/28/2010,"you'll note that i specified the secretary, not all nine of them. the secretaries thus far(ankh, oz, meissa, tea) have all been more or less reasonable folks - the jokesters tend not to want the workload that position implies. yeah, we noticed. admittedly, necro is less bad in this forum than in many others, but it's still generally poor practice - messes with too many people's heads."
1/28/2010,"as any player who has ever experinced severe lag knows how frustrating that it is. i'm not talking about lag where all your acitons are delayed by 30 seconds im talking about being on the receiving end of a blank screen for 30 minutes, then suddenly having an insureance mail arrive (whilst still on a completely blank screen) then waitng another 20 mintues to either load a completely war torn grid in a 'pod' or show up in a station. ccp, in my very honest opinion this is a horrific burdon on your part. i find it utterly appaling that you continue to release promotion videos for a game ("
1/28/2010,"while i can understand your frustration. but pushing 1500-1600 people into d-g was just no good idea. all in all we dont need more threads about the lag.ccp is aware of this. just in case you missed the ingame news, this thread or this thread.they are aware.they are working on it.and your posting is not a proposal just whining. get a tea, fit a new ship and hope the next fight would have less than 1500 in local."
1/28/2010,"lag is a really big issue, but i don't think it can be solved without any change in game mechanic. here is my analysis on what causes blob to be a winning tactic, and my proposal to act on gameplay mechanic to change it and fix lag once for all.this obviously does not exclude working on technical problems, but i state that lag will not be fixed with technical improvements: people will keep packing in a single solarsystem until in crashes or lag becomes so terrible that they decide to log off. my proposal would require to split fights over many solarsystem in a constellation setting a minimum of solarsystem to contest at once, with constellation-wide reinforcement timers. please check it it this thread and contribute."
1/28/2010,"and while you are at it, when the scan is complete, show the full market value of all the loot, sorry cargo/fittings."
1/28/2010,"i do not support this.this is heavily aimed at making suicide ganking even easier & quicker (in terms of the decision loop). i'd be all for adding a universal ""view market details"", or ""view available contracts"" right click on any item, but this, as proposed, is ""please boost ambushing passing ships""."
1/28/2010,i will support this as soon as i can fit a module to reduce the chances of that cargo/ship scanner of getting a good read on what i have.
1/28/2010,this.
1/28/2010,"although i don't like suiside ganking, my personal rule of thumb is that game should not be balanced by making something more clickes away. if suiside ganking is to be nerfed/contained (which is shall), it shall be done by other means."
1/28/2010,"cross training is bad for balance? wtf this is eve not wowcross training makes you a more versatile pilot. the more skips you can fly the tricks you have up your sleeve. to be honest it sounds like you have no clue what your talking about. the purpose of most caldari missile boats are long range pve (in my book) if you want a pvp sniper fleet go amar or minmatar. or at stated above go for a caldari gum boat they are there you know. if you fly caldari and only use missiles you can only use half the ships.that would be like flying minmatar and training the following. gunnery skills, missile skills, drone skills, shield tanking skills and armour tanking skills."
1/28/2010,"so... what you're saying is:remove the drawbacks of having high dps at 200km range and the diversity of weapon systems in doing so,make missiles act like fighters without needing to train for a carrier.you don't want to waste caldari navy scourge missiles if your target warps away.these changes would make being a caldari player even easier, and even more boring."
1/28/2010,i've always desliked the way missile spray wastes huge amounts of dps at any range.i support your first proposal.i think that any unexploded missiles ( of the firing ship ) should attack the next target you activate your launchers on as the firing ship still has control of those missiles.
1/28/2010,"i was wondering if warping missles might only work for torpedos and citadel size missles, which also means they'd be only really effective against larger targets. the idea behind it is that smaller sized ship engagements are not affected. (besides, it makes sense that only really big missles/torpedos are big enough to fit a warpdrive on them anyway.) it, however, also paves the way for a person with a laser pointer to target a ship that his buddy, who is orbiting another planet in the system could then fire his missles at. the missles warp to the planet where the target is being pointed, et voil<U+FFFD>.your thoughts?"
1/28/2010,"it would be interesting to find out how well the eve community rates its gms in handling petitions.split in to different areas, such as 0.0, low sec and empire. then broken down under petition category. i'm curious to see how well the eve community rates its gms and their policies, volume of petitions vs. expansion dates, and so on.maybe the gms and whoever dictates gm policy could use this information as a kpi in how well they deal with petitions.to prevent people from using this data for metagaming purposes, the data should be released only on a monthly or even quarterly basis.releasing this information would let some transparency shine through on to ccp.. something the company lacks at the moment. if it's clear that deficiency is found in a certain area, then perhaps ccp could open a more direct dialog with its customers to see how they can improve customer service."
1/28/2010,would be really interesting to see this kind of statistics!/signed
1/28/2010,fyp not supported though.
1/28/2010,"well, clicking on a value between 1 and 10 really isn't that hard. i think with a bit of common sense, gms can easily understand why the petition received the score given. we all need to remember that gms themselves aren't programmable mass-message distribution systems and the policies they enforce are crafted by the higher ups in ccp.. so what i'm saying is even though sometimes they come across as emotionless robots, there's a person behind that canned message.. i hope ;)even so, as mentioned before, the release of this information is needed to let the community know how well they are supported, and what they should expect. of course if ccp declines to do so, it merely reinforces the opaque and care-free image the company is projecting upon itself through some of its policies."
1/28/2010,"what good would the information do us? some people can't be satisfied, so even a perfect gm team will have imperfect ratings, and people will just whine about how it's not high enough and they need to do better. and it's not like ccp will listen any more to us if we have the ratings data than if we don't - they know the numbers, they know if it's a vocal minority that's annoyed or a widely felt sentiment. i think they should share the data with the csm, but putting numbers out publicly seem like pain with no gain."
1/28/2010,"they showed the stats to the csm3... i dont think i can exactly post the page(dont know if i even still have it), but the ratings went up. they were giving a whole presentation about how everything got better with the gm's since 2007(or 2008, i forget), in categories like waiting time, score, number of responses till it was closed. and i think gm count, if i remember right.its worth a devblog though, stats are always interesting"
1/28/2010,"this would only add to the critism ccp gets now as the petition system is broken.takes too long to respond and in alot of cases even though they have the persons e-mail and character info you get a message saying petion closed failure to respond. the person filing it was never made aware they had a responce , so ill assume if you cant answer the question make it look like the capsuleer dropped the ball. go team they need to look at all thier promises made on the net to the public only to fail at everyturn."
1/28/2010,pain with no gain? they gain a more transparent image and we can see who the whiners are.they added the rating system and have never spoken out to the userbase about what they're doing to improve customer service.
1/28/2010,not supporting.we have no business knowing what they do.that's ia's job.
1/28/2010,"while i agree with you broadly, that's actually not ia's job. ia's job is to investigate corruption, not user satisfaction."
1/28/2010,"not supported,i agree with drake draconis, those are performance reviews and are between the gm and their boss."
1/28/2010,i would think ia would be interested in seeing negative feedback statistics over gm's.isn't that what they are supposed to do? supervise not just investigate? if not provide some oversight? how else are they supposed to get there data.either way... we both agree... not our business... it does nothing more than cause needless epeen stroking and griping over something we have literally no control over.it's like throwing a fit over a killmail... it happened.. what the #### you gonna do about it?: o pthat and no one would be satisfied with the amount of information... people will continue to ask for more or claim its false... blah blah blah.no ones going to lift a finger to open that can of worms.if people are that upset... they would quit. funny they never leave... they just whine some more.
1/28/2010,"i suppose the problem would be reduced if people could not vote on a member of their own alliance. this ofcourse brings forth a host of other problems, but it might still be worth it."
1/28/2010,i thought about that... but then the really good people who have large alliances backing them would be cut off as well.nasty pickle to be sure.you should start a different thread about this... this thread is not what i call a good way of discussing the csm troubles.as i think disbanding them is a baaaad idea.

1/28/2010,"the only accountability an elected cms representative or any elected official has is to the ballot box. likewise, the only tool the membership has is to exercise their voice and approval or disapproval thru the ballot box. i understand all the issues and concerns laid out from not enough information on canditates, to large alliances casting majority votes for their pet member, to the memberships' inability to do anything about the poor performance of an elected cms representative. the process however, is like any other democratic process, and unless the membership really gets involved, these problems will not be mitigated. i would concentrate more on the election process and attempting to better inform and motivate the member base. they need to feel comfortable that they have the information they need to place an educated vote for a particular candidate to represent them, and motivated that their representatives and the cms system will repond as intended -- on behalf of the membership base."
1/28/2010,"well, as i said a couple of posts ago, i actually feel that taking the human factor of the csm out of the picture is what'll fix our problems. it wouldn't really be a csm anymore though. just give players the ability to get their opinions directly to ccp in the form of survey results and you won't need a csm."
1/28/2010,"you can never take the human factor out of any group of people.ccp included.the fact this is a democractic process is a insult in itself.democracy implies people are discerning enough to know the difference between good and bad... in the end all a democratic process gets you is a popularity stunt.like it is in real life.... which doesn't really matter a whole heck of a lot even today. (thank you oh so very much college electoral)such things translate to the current csm... you have a ""democratic"" process of election (note the quote marks ;) ) and then you look at who really votes?therein is your problem.i didn't vote last time around because a: i was very tired and lazy.b: i had no incentive to vote let alone lift a damn finger because i was so ****ed off at mazz and lark for the bull**** stunt they pulled.people are going to react just like i did....why bother? why should they vote when its a laughing stock?we are just single individual pilots... how many votes will it take before someone can make a difference? in the end... its a futile gesture to even vote.fix that problem... and you'll get somewhere.give the people an incentive to vote. (no not bribing : o p )"
1/28/2010,"in the system i propose there would be no need for voting, because there is no csm."
1/28/2010,granted... but no csm is worse.we need gamers who are discerning enough to relay problems and ideas to ccp.making them listen to potentially 50 to 60 thousand pilots is not what i call a smart move.committee or not... the csm is nice for that particular problem.however... the individuals who are put in the csm.... well.. perhaps its time we inflict more qualifications and less grandstanding.
1/28/2010,"i reckon you'll always run into the corruption problem in any electoral system. you could have ccp hire phd's in psychology/gamedesign/politics to form a permanent csm which might reduce the problem, but that's pretty close to what i'm saying, minus the survey tools which i think a permanent csm made up of educated people would opt for anyway."
1/28/2010,i honestly doubt a phd let alone a bloody psychiatrist is going to know anything about eve online to be quite honest.the people who get hired to do the job should be unbiased seasoned eve pilots.good luck finding that.
1/28/2010,"i disagree, the permanent csm would only be 'relaying the messege'. they're there to figure out what people want, not how to give it to them, that's up to ccp's game designers. i'd imagine the permanent csm are statisticians, and psychologists who know how to set up surveys and how to analyze them."
1/28/2010,think about what you just said.who would you rather deliever the message... someone who understands and has done whatever the hell it is your doing?we don't need to be pyschoanalyzed and share our problems while lying on a couch.we need people who play this game on a frequent basis... people who understand the mechanics and day to day struggles in working around the problems and trying to come up with solutions.people who have no agenda and not interested in grandstanding or getting a free trip to fanfest and don't give a crap about us.getting some phd or some psycho to listen to us is a total waste of time.
1/28/2010,"the people relaying the messege really have no need for playing experience, the designers who decide what to do with the data however, do. i consider it a mistake that csm members see themselves as needing to know what fixes player's problems. that's gamedesign, not the task of a representative of the people. a representative needs to know how to listen. and people who have surveys and statistical analysis in their trackrecord of education can do so."
1/28/2010,"alright let me attempt to explain what i mean.i work for a computer shop.... i sell pc's... and mac's.i also fix them... i'm a certified tech... a professional apple care technician to boot.wouldn't you rather talk to the tech who fixes them.... as far as purchasing a computer... as opposed to some punk sales kid who's more interested in getting a commission check?who would you trust more?eve is its own world... its own culture. you try to explain eve to some average joe who plays wow and they are going to go glossy eyed.i would expect the same for some random phd or some such.bottom line - eve is like its own langauge... if you don't speak it... know it... fluently... hireing a translator is going to be foolish.i do not want some random joe to handle the critical process of collecting and coalating data for ccp when it comes to critical matters such as lag.... or skill injections... or super-capital ships.i would rather have someone who knows how to fly that said ship and (dare i say) is intimately familiar with it.not someone who knows how to read a book and generate stats... hell anyone can do that.few can play eve online and know it well enough to relay information.not even i would fit that job... i'm just starting... and i've been at it for a little over 2 years if not at.furthermore... my pet peeves with mazz and lark (whom i seem to pick on frequently) are there actions... not there experience.if either of them tell me ""this ship does this and this way because i've been doing this for this long and that's that"" i'm not likely to argue with them.i will argue with them when it comes to there stance on ethics and accountability.so when it boils down to my large sore spot with those 2 its political... not experience in eve.bottom line yet again... if we don't get people who are experienced with the daily life of eve... they have no business representing us let alone dealing with the data they collect."
1/28/2010,"granted, but the expertese you're after tends to come in a package deal, along with the personal interest such an expert has invested in the game, aswell as that he can't be held very accountable, being that he's just a player, not a payed employee who has his livelihood depending on his ability to keep his job.also, a lot of experts lack the other skills required to be a representative: they feel they're so keenly aware of the game and what it needs that they stop to listen.with permanent employees who have good credentials, you will lose some of the experience, and gain reliability, which in my view is a good trade. would ofcourse be nicer to get both, but how do you go about getting that?"
1/28/2010,that's why i said unbiased experienced pilots.but again... i don't know how.... surely someone around here has an idea that would involve keeping what we got... but altering the rules or the process of election to make it fit better.perhaps you force them to leave there various alliances/corporations much like an isd volunteer... this would force them to be detached to a degree and would have to do a great deal of work around to get anywhere.and to prevent alt abuse... require a 2 year old pilot age requirement to get elected in the first place. (for those with more than one account... verify via credit card records and such... hell they (ccp) want a passport.. its just gonna be a little obvious if they are frakking around)no one should be allowed to run if they are on an different account. (if that's not a rule already it should be!)this keeps the repeat alternate crap and people who get thrown out from coming back without a great deal of effort and cost to there own.nothing stops them from doing alliance business... but it would give the impression of neutrality and less on judging them due to there ties to whatever alliance.it may not be perfect... but it would cause alot of frustration on the current status quo and may change it up juuust enough to make it work.
1/28/2010,"to be honest, i'm rather sceptical of that that would work. mostly because in order for the people to have faith in the system again, it shouldn't look too much like the csm we allready know or they'll argue that it hasn't really changed, and they'll still have biass against it. and without good playerbase involvement, it won't work no matter what we do."
1/28/2010,csm is hated because of peoples actions... not because of the csm itself.they just don't know who to blame... so the csm gets slapped around.so change the behavior of the csm and get people to try again.restrict who can run and who cant... make it harder to get in.i would give it an another shot if convinced there was a good shot.but shutting it down would be worse.
1/28/2010,"i don't think the average human being works that way, they'll want to see radical change before scepsis goes away. in the end, even if the change is just cosmetic in nature, i'd still support the main idea of disbanding and reforming the csm or the idea behind it."
1/28/2010,"the above posters are correct its meant to be expensive for a reason :)that being said, i wouldnt think theres anything wrong with providing the bpo's and making it expensive to manufacture component/mineral wise so that wh inhabitants/nullsec alliances could have easier access to them.ofc i don't live in wh space or nullsec, so..."
1/28/2010,"as long as it costs basically the same to build as to buy from npc's (maybe a 5-10% discount, but no more), i'm fine with this."
1/28/2010,"im pretty much on the side that says if it can be bought it ought to be player produced. there are other more efficeint ways to get isk out of the game docking fees, crew costs etc. npc products used for this purpose feels like a false market (because it is).edit: the thumb is imprortant!"
1/28/2010,docking fees and crew costs are the worse way to remove isk from the game as they can make the game unplayable for people with little isk. unsubbing for a period and returning to a negative wallet because you have paid crew fees witout getting isk would push people to isk buying or abandoning the game.
1/28/2010,"those were just two throw out suggestions, and there are easy work arounds for those. the point was that there are better ways to remove isk if it becomes a concern. the player market works well (one of the most important aspects of the game as far as i'm concerned)and should be as open as possible without npc interference.(this is completely besides the point but since you threw some red herring arguments into the mix i'll address them. if you're intersted, the crew fees would only apply to ships with crews and only when you're flying. thus frigates would cost nothing in terms of those. docking fees could also be by ship type and its a one time charge not an hourly fee. second your home station determined by medical clone could be free of charge. or it could just be one of those two, or somthing else entirely. there are so many ways to work this that making the argument ""its unplayable"" is ridiculous. also we arn't talking about huge sums here. )"
1/28/2010,"a) if you want to do ""just two throw out suggestions"" try to avoid those that are evidently bad. if you make them they must be taken as serious suggestions. you suggestion is part of this thread so it is valid to comment upon it. again ""pay the crew to fly the ship"" while good for immersion could break the game for people low on isk. b) ""we want everything to be player made"" is not a good idea (and this suggestion is part of that line of thougt). the game need isk sinks and the dependance to supply lines to npc providers for some item. c) nanite paste is a ""luxury"", not a indispensable item like ammunitions or ships so it is a item well suited to be produced only by npc."
1/28/2010,i want a button on these forums that shows a downward pointing thumb to show i do not support the topic.
1/28/2010,"i'm almost certain that this one has already been raised to ccp, likely several times by now. everyone agrees, but it can't be expected before the forum software changes. hopefully those are coming this summer, at which point this sort of change would already be in the works."
1/28/2010,"well now that they killed the only decent way to make isk while being in fw, surprise surprise we see a mass exodus from fw. ""amarr militia needs corps!"":"
1/28/2010,yes we are very sorry that militias now have to work for their navy geddons a bit more than before. but what i gather from my friends in militia it isnt all that hard to make lp quickly.
1/28/2010,"i read the above as ""i don't know what i'm talking about."" but people who did actually participate in fw and knew what they were talking about said this will lead to allot of people leaving fw and low sec. ccp did the change anyway, and allot of people are leaving/left fw and low sec. just saying. btw are you sure your friends are still in the militia and haven't left yet? : ) you don't work any harder to do fw missions after this change. you just don't do them because you can't decline missions that send you to places like ammamake. go ahead and do a few missions there tell me about it. unless you are part of a big corp that can field a large farming fleet at times when no one else is online, or you can play eve full time and wait four hours between missions, its just not a real viable option anymore. anyway, i don't think more people made fortunes in fw, than pilots in high sec or null sec. most just did missions so they would have ships they could blow up in pvp. a very few people may have made good isk but from what i hear it required allot of work and coordination. i suppose you think that should only be allowed in high sec and null sec."
1/28/2010,yes they are still in militia and i regularly buy fw lp only stuff from them. they have no problems with supplying.
1/28/2010,as a miner who works in high sec and worm holes i support the upgrading of the exhumers who are attacked way too often by gankers simply because they know they can usually take out the mining vessels in quick order before they can either escape or help arrives to hinder them but its not just the miners who need an upgrade its proving now that even the industrials need upgrading takes forever to get the skills to fly ittys and such like but they havent got a tank of any sort really and suffer ganking a lot because of this.ok rant over :p
1/28/2010,"funny thing, that's not actually how it works. military vessels of any quality don't just take civilian vehicles and strap on armor - an aircraft carrier isn't just a freighter with steam catapults. they are designed fundamentally differently, from the keel up. civilian ships are designed to be cheap, military ships are designed to withstand damage, and not just with a few inches of steel on the outside. a miner should have a physically large hull, yes, but that does not in any way translate into having a lot of hull hp. it translates into a ship that's built of tissue paper but has a big cargo hold. 1) suicide ganking is supposed to be possible. it's an intended game mechanic. 2) you're fitting your iteron wrong. mine has had multiple suicide gank attempts, and never gotten below like 75% armor. admittedly, most gankers know how to kill hulks, and tailor their gank ships to break even a good tank, but that is definitely not true of most other civilian ships."
1/28/2010,"that is a really good point herschel that i had not considered. i was honestly comparing it to that of an orca cause when i looked at the orcas stats it made sense to me that it has such a high structural hp. if only for the reason that it would take lazers a long time to melt down all that structure required for such a large ship to keep out the rigors of space, and since most of that hull is required for cargo bays, even longer to burn through it to get down to the ""vital organs"" of such a vessel. that was my thought on the matter. a military vessel of equal size would by necessity have a small cargo hold and much more ""vital organs"" but the same structural considerations considering how much armor you need to strap to the outsides of it.i probably dont make any sense. i read the forums more than i get to play the game haha due to real life getting in the way. +1 for getting to read the forums at work though.1st edit: fixed spelling2nd edit: explained first edit! doh"
1/28/2010,signature radius is already sent to your client to determine lock time. so why not have it viewable?
1/28/2010,"correct. size column is pointless as currently implemented. all frigates/destroyers are the same size. all cruisers/battlecruisers are the same size. all battleships etc... i filed a bug report concerning the fact that size has no relationship to signature: the response indicated that it is ""working as intended"".this feature request is supported."
1/28/2010,it wouldn't be.i thought the way that i build my post made it clear that i was sarcastic :pand what sense does it make to support something that's op? it'll just get nerfed later anyways.
1/28/2010,"yeah, this would be nice."
1/28/2010,excellent suggestion!
1/28/2010,great little feature that could save so much hassle and hair.
1/28/2010,"someone proposed a similar idea where all missiles would retarget if their target was destroyed while the missiles were en-route. now it seems there are a few things that can go wrong with that (fcs calling for a missile salvo on a target they are about to alpha, so the missiles may veer off and strike something else, alpha-ing it without warning?)my modification of the idea:fof missiles are meant to acquire and launch at targets with a minimum of pilot input. currently, missiles suffer the ""travel time"" problem, where the target is occasionally dead with missiles still in space in flight to the target.what if fof missiles retargeted and finished their flight towards another target, assuming 1)the missiles still have enough flight time left, and 2)the target had triggered an fof launch(i believe you have to be fired upon for fof missiles to launch at the target?)it is my current understanding that fof missiles as they stand now are useful for overcoming jamming, and have drawbacks from normal missiles which compensate for that advantage. to keep this from simply being a ""missile buff"", it might be necessary to put a new skill into the game to control it, say ""friend or foe missile specialization?"" that gives fof missiles a 20% chance per level to retarget."
1/28/2010,missiles never miss. this is how flight time is balance with other weapon types. not supported.
1/28/2010,"1. it impedes them from learning the game by pushing back their skill training rate, since there's gaps in it. fyi, some skills r a requirement to use certain ships and mods. did u know that?2. checking in once in a while is not the problem 'cause i never said anything about pushing the queue past 24 hours, did i? no, i didn't. i merely supported non-exploiting auto-injection, which still can't be commanded to be done without *gasp* logging in. zomg! it's all clear now! i hope...3. tell that to drake. he's the slow one who can't comprehend that no one can afk forever, even with this improvement.4. it doesn't matter if injection took a nanosecond 'cause once again, u can't be away from that comp on a real life issue to actually inject. step a before step b. step b takes 2 seconds, step a is the variable. put 2 and 2 together.fyi, u still have to log in every 24 hours to update the queue, even with auto-injections. and that hardly qualifies as ""afking the damn thing to death.""and it's not your problem we're asking for this change for a game either. all we're asking for is convenience for a game, yet u're the one whining about it.and that just proves your ignorance again. there's no auto-purchasing of skills or auto-lvling up in wow. fail.r u paying for my subscription? no? then i'll do what i want to do and take eve in moderation. if u have a problem with that, well that's not my problem u can't stop whining about it."
1/28/2010,"i'm in favour of both free injection of skills(hey, if you want to spend money on a skill you can't use, be my guest) and a removal of the training queue length cap. skills are too fundamental to the game to force us to screw around with them - if i have a paid account, i should be able to train whatever i want, whether i poke my head in every day or not."
1/28/2010,"contrary to what i stated in my original post, it appears the topic isn't as self explanatory as i thought it would be.ill post exactly what i meant so people don't need to guess at itsay im training medium projectile turret 5 (actually, i am training it atm) and i want to train medium autocannon specialization right after its finished (assuming i have the other pre-reqs, motion prediction 4 and small autocannon spec 4). at the moment, the only way to do this would be to be logged on at the exact time when medium projectile turret 5 finishes, which can be a problem if it happens to finish in the middle of the night, or while you're otherwise unable to access a computer. what i'm proposing is to be able to add skillbooks to the skill queue the same way you add injected skills to the queue and when the queue reaches the skillbook it will just start training (assuming the skillbook would be usable in those circumstances, otherwise skip the skill and anything following it that happened to need it as prerequisites). while this sounds stupid, why not just train motion prediction to 5 or something while im asleep. well, thats a possibility, and i do it when i can. but for things like making alts in the shortest span of time possible to save training time, you want the skills to be trained on the spot and as optimized as possible. regardless, its a minor issue, and nothing for ccp to worry about if it cant be implemented with about 5-10 minutes worth of coding when more important issues and fixes are on the agenda."
1/28/2010,i don't get what the problem is.other than my proposed idea.... which again as i said was passed and carried up to ccp... you get a full on 24 hours to put that skill in.an entire day... to log on... take 3 minutes to grab your skill book and figure out what you need to do next.the only problem is you get locked out due to the pre-reqs rule... hence my proposed idea to resolve that.only other way around this is to pick a generic skill to train... wait for your current one to finish then switch it back.automation is going to result in severe abuse and afk'ing that alot of us will not like.while hersch has a valid point... free injection of skills is too much freedom and removes the risk from transporting valuable books... so your pirates are going to be screaming about that.course i wouldn't care much either way as its a benefit. (thank you 0.0 markets)when it gets right down to it... imho my idea is the most balanced and thought out solution to this conundrum.any other way is begging to be called an exploit. (think ghost training)
1/28/2010,"as much as things that are easier are nice, i honestly think the 24 hour skill queue is as far as ccp should go in automating skill training. i don't think it is really too much of an issue to simply add another skill after the prerequisites finish and then inject that new skill the next time you log on.i deal with it this way over my main and alts just fine."
1/28/2010,"good point, i also would imagine it only activates when warp selected."
1/28/2010,yes please.
1/28/2010,please and thank you ccp!
1/28/2010,"the whole market system needs an overhaul, i never said this would be easy. as for a solution to the problem for the whole market. keep it the way it is, then add corporate & alliance store fronts. this gives people the ability to show off the goods. i'm not talking cutsie stores. i mean something maybe depending on size, need & social skills costs a monthly rental fee. i also can see this being a nightmare server wise. next i do agree with adding a negative effect as well. as to what depends on the ship. make it something relevant to the survival of the ship, i don't want to see an abbadon with a shield recharge negative effect. t3 has it's own vision and works well, to a point.there are more important things out there than this idea, fix destroyers( really ccp for the love of all things holy fix them ), fixing the pos system.

1/28/2010,"oh, agreed, t3 is the model to go for here. i don't think t3 was implemented quite right, but it's a far more coherent approach than op's."
1/28/2010,"i like this idea! *supported*i played star wars galaxies in the beginning and they had a very phantastic production system...i was able to build weapons (or whatever) with completely different stats and it was always the sameweapon-""name it here"".so everyone was able to choose the xyz-sniper with the stats that fits his specific needs.in eve we only have all the same standard hulls, boring as hell.it would make more fun if e.g. a rokh can be modified altering stats during production or invention.using rigging modules is not the same!this would boost the invention to 10000% from the current situation..if you want to have a uber-rokh, you have to pay uber-prices...if you want a cheap rokh, you get a less tanked rokh or a rusty one if you want a rokh for mining, then: well here you have some altered stats for this.however, balancing the stats will become a very important thing in the game.in which way this can be exactly done is very complex discussion, because:adding features to a ship which normally doesnt has this feature.removing features from a ship to get room for new features or to make other features much higherand so on ...and pvp can make more fun, because you are never sure, is this a altered ship or not...if yes... which stats was altered, added, removed ...this makes ship scanner really worth her slot!producing ships with this posibillities will make a lot of more fun!*forgive my bad english ... *"

1/29/2010,"after an extensive threadnaught in ships and modules, me and liang came up with the following proposal for the re-balancing of railguns (and the caldari railboats in conjuction with that change). this proposal amounts to:+15% to railguns' dmg modifier-reduce spike optimal bonus to 70%+10% to caldari railboats pg(so they are up to par with gallente ones as far as fitting requirements).the thread where arguments and counter arguments were flung at each other is here. please ignore the obvious trolls that try to derail it.also, so that the csm can use it, and after being proposed there are graphs and a rounding up of all the arguments that have gone back and forth here.the railgun issue has been put to vote by csm and was dropped because they did not have a specific proposal. therefore i put one up with numbers, data and logical justification. also it has more support and views than most of the many other issues.finally, it affects more than 50% of the eve populace and half the issues concerning gallente and caldari are tied to underperforming weapon systems, especially hybrids. it is of concern to both pvp and pve pilots, so i think it is of interest for a lot of people.p.s. i have no proposal for blasters yet, my data are very scant on them. if anyone wants to do a separate thread about them, be my guest."
1/29/2010,because i naturally forgot to support my own idea. duh!!
1/29/2010,"got to back this one up, its utterly sad that arty got such a huge bonus, but rails still utterly suck, especially when hybrid ammo is supposed to be ""soooooooooo"" powerful according to lore."
1/29/2010,"if you could, i'd like to see a graph of the current state of the long range weapons in the game, and then what this change would do to it.my one concern with basing all these arguments on caldari snipers is how gallente ones will turn out. i don't think that +15% is so extreme that it'll break balance, but i'd still like that train of thought sorted out before i support it."
1/29/2010,"yes, since rails are no longer the sniping platform of choice, both changes make them viable"
1/29/2010,"so here's the stats on how the assorted t2 turrets compare. the ""dps"" number is not actual dps, it's simply multiplier/rof, since all other dps mods are basically the same. all numbers are before any skills or ship bonuses. dps@optimal+falloff(tracking)425mm rail: 0.345 @57.6+24 (0.0096)tachyon beam: 0.432 @52.8+20 (0.0139)1400mm arty: 0.319 @48+35 (0.009)250mm rail: 0.518 @28.8+12 (0.023)heavy beam: 0.6 @24+8 (0.033)720mm arty: 0.478 @24+17.5 (0.022)150mm rail: 0.776 @14.4+6 (0.07)medium beam: 0.9 @12+4 (0.1)280mm arty: 0.717 @12+8.75 (0.066)if any long-range turret needs a buff, it's arty. they do noticeably less damage than rails, track a shade worse, and their ranges don't match up until about one falloff out. rails do less raw dps than beams, but their range is significantly better. this doesn't seem like it cries out for a flat 15% damage boost - that would give them almost the same dps as beams, with significantly better range. i know amarr is fotm and all, but that doesn't mean you need to make other stuff better instead. regarding the pg issue, which ships are you referring to? the rokh can fit 8x425 ii and a mwd ii with one t1 rcu(not exactly onerous, given it's a sniper boat with five lows), and nobody actually cares about any of the other caldari rail boats."

1/29/2010,"very good idea, i like the idea of adding these ctrl shortcut especially the ""ctrl+approach to retreat"""
1/29/2010,"""replace kinetic missile bonus with r.o.f or damage bonus""it is absolutely unfair. it means dps boost because you can shoot in weak resist points (em for shields or exp for armor).last minmatar ammo change have boosted their weapon. now they can vary damage type more effectively. hybrids and lasers can not.p.s. example. imagine you know your pvp opponent ship type. what will you tank? against hybrid ship - thrm kinagainst laser ship - em thrmagainst projectile ship - i do not know.... now they can everything!against raven - i do not know - it can any damage type with the same effectiveness."
1/29/2010,this is insane in the membrane.missiles are just fine in balance. if anything need change its rail and beam
1/29/2010,"no dude your wrong.whats absolutelly unfair ( i would choose the word imbalanced ) is thatmini get 33% more dps at level 5 hull trainingamarr get 33% more dps at level 5 hull traininggal get 25% more dps ( blasters ) and 50% more dps ( drones ) at level 5 hull trainingcaldari get 8% more dps at level 5 hull trainingand as has been repeated ad infinituum in this thread allready , blaster and lasers start with far more dps than missiles and projectile to make up for there inability to target resist holes."
1/29/2010,wtf gallente are getting shafted too by your numbers! and fixed that for ya
1/29/2010,supporting
1/29/2010,"guys i think the real point here is caldari missile boats are only doing 1 damage types where as turrets get to do 2-4 damage types and without the bonus to all missiles then the versatility of using missiles is lost, and yes overall missiles are not super great pvp weapons to begin withand yeah drones only do 1 damage type and yeah only the gallente and minmatar drones are really worth it.. but drones don't take up slots and drone ships are pretty versatile.. and they can fit turrets too... sooo... yeah.anyways yeah i'm all for the bonus getting changed to all missile types, i see no reason, come caldari ships already have this, some amarr too.. and it doesnt break the gameyeah you can run around with scourge missiles and just stfu and life will go on but i really think it would make more sense to get rid of the kinetic only bonus in favor of just +5% missile damage per level overall"
1/29/2010,"a bit of patience wont work... you need to make a noise! listen to the people of lowsec!and not faction war... that is almost irrelevent to the people who live in lowsec, it is an entirely different event.what we are talking about there are the criminals, outlaws, gangs and warlords who live here, the anti pirates and bounty hunters who stalk there and lowsec industrials, the smugglers, black market dealers, teh adventurous from hisec wanting a little action., miners willing to risk the danger.. or willing to pay the criminals to be left alone...lowsec should be a dynamic environment, dark and dangerous, but with its own politics and workings...ccp listen! that is the lowsec we want!"

1/29/2010,"not a pirate but know a few, and read their blogs etc, and as a highsec/nullsec dweller, outlaws and lowsec need some love...but i also thing their should be some difference between 0.4-0.1 right now their just numbers theirs no actual difference that i can tell something needs to make that change....so lowsec sovereignty of sorts, well not sovereignty but im sure we can come up with an underworld crime syndicate type name. edit: what i find most hysterical about lowsec is... lowsec mining = epic fail, its literally useless why ever ever ever ever risk lowsec mining or even ninja mining it the ores worth less than every other highsec ore!how about drug running missions in lowsec, kinda like courier missions that pay better but between lowsec areas, and always to do with drugs and carry drugs or manufacturing drugs in lowsec. 100% lowsec on both sides, designed for pirates and cloaky haulers etc."
1/29/2010,"proposala button or drop-down menu selection that reconnects to drones lost on either a warp-out or a disconnect.conditions (edit 2010.02.04 approx. 18:45: added this section)1. the option is available if the player warps away from the drones for any reason.2. the drones are still considered ""active"", thus more drones cannot be deployed unless the active drones are recovered or abandoned.3. due to signal decay, the drones are effectively ""abandoned"" if they are not recovered within 10 minutes.4. jumping systems or docking automatically abandons the drones.5. it is not possible to reconnect to abandoned drones.reasoningi've recently gotten into t2 drones, and in just a week of using them, i've lost three sets in missions when i had a network disconnect. even in a cruiser, i don't have enough time to reach them before the mission rats kill them off. the loss is frustrating when it's a 2.5 mil set of hammerhead iis. i think a reconnect button would give us a chance to at least recover some of them before they get popped. as previous threads have stated, this mimics the way we can reconnect to lost probes; so, while i won't assume that the actual programming will be simple, i see the fix as one that makes logical sense.note: i hunted through previous posts on this topic and found several inactive threads; but reading through them seemed to suggest that they had general community support, and that this was something that could warrant the csms' attention. apologies if this has gone up the chain before and been rejected."

1/29/2010,i support this one
1/29/2010,"i would link them in the sense that every unit in all the constellation must be in one of some defined states in order to enter reinforcement mode. this means that attacker is not going to lose the system if only some of the sbus are down, but only if they all down everywhere or if the battles in every system are won or lost. and then the attacker has the possibility to save his achievements for the next time if he manage to put some new sbus online in the next 12 hours."
1/29/2010,"absolutely brilliant, would have a huge impact on the current problem.--rax"
1/29/2010,"while i don't think that it would solve the problem because mobility of bs fleet is too high anyway compared to the size of the battlefield, this is a very simple proposal that sould be very easy and fast to implement."
1/29/2010,as i get older in the game i found that my and other corp mates clone costs are getting fairly high. this seems okay when flying something big but when flying cheap frigs or cruisers my pod cost (without any implants) is more than the loss from the ship.i propose a change to the current clone costs to make it level out as you get older.current costs
1/29/2010,i support my own idea after i've patiently waited for 5 mins.
1/29/2010,"i, franga, from the same corporation and alliance as matting, support this idea.however, i wish it known that even if i wasn't in the same corporation and alliance as matting, i would still support this idea.edit: i, franga, from the same corporation and alliance as matting, forgot to click the 'support' button when posting."
1/29/2010,"smooth post as for the idea in the op, it might be good idea with some alterations. the cost should be somewhat larger at the high end and the increase shouldn't be so sudden in the low sp range. but i agree that the increase in clone cost seems a bit too steep. it isn't cripling, but being an old character should't mean your frigate/cruiser roams keep getting financially significantly more demanding, although the actual equipment you use doesn't change in any way. the loss should be based on the hardware you use, not your sp count.as for reducing the isk sink, i admit that might be an issue, i would still prefer that the sink be relocated away from the actual clone loss to other areas. dare i mention slightly reduced insurance payment to balance it. since you lose just the ship much more often than your pod, the decrease in payment percentages wouldn't need to be significant. i don't really care how it is balanced though."
1/29/2010,"not supported.the argument that your pod costs more to replace than your ship at higher skill point levels is disingenuous. you specifically mention t1 frigate/cruiser roams so let's look at that specifically.currently, the most expensive minmatar frigate on the regional market where i am is the rifter, weighing in at 160,000 isk. the most expensive cruiser is the rupture at 4.9 million.a full set of +2 attribute implants which are, let's be honest, pretty cheap as implants go, will run you about 12 million isk (they're averaging about 2.5 million isk each where i am). that's 2.5 times as much as the rupture and about 78 times as expensive than the rifter. even with fittings, unless you're including rigs and/or officer mods, you'd have a hard time hitting 12 million with the rifter, though you could probably exceed it with the rupture. and let's be honest, if you're fitting officer mods, your clone is really the least of your expenses.additionally, your suggested scale would reduce the isk sink for older characters by close to 90% at the 100 million skill point mark, while increasing the cost at the 5 million mark by nearly 1000%. so you move the isk sink away from the area it's really needed, tht being precisely those older characters who generally have the most liquid assets and place it squarely on the people least able to to keep up with it."
1/29/2010,strongly opposed.this harms new players who have few paths to make the isk for clones and rewards well established character that have many paths to make the isk for clones.
1/29/2010,"saying it's disingenuous is really rude and hurtful. it also misses the point. my clones cost 20mil a pop clean. using your idea of plugging it with +2s means it now costs 32mil. what the op is suggesting is that having a 32mil clone to fly a 3-5mil rifter discourages him from roaming more in null-sec where the chance of being podded is far, far higher.lets say that you want to go out and have some cheap fun (because you don't have the time to sit and pour over market figures and trade or run missions and grind or whatever other time sink to make money) and you've got 5 x 5mil rifters fit. so 25mil of hardware. you're going to null-sec and get podded at least 3 of those times and lose the rifter all 5 times.that's 25mil hardware you've lost but 66mil worth of clones. the night has cost you 89mil for 5 cheap ships and all i wanted to do was have a go at a few ceptors and then die to the eventual blob at a gate. as a rule, i'm not a big fan of throwing away nearly 90mil just because i feel like soloing and that prohibits me from going to null-sec, something ccp would like to see more of.but remember, we're all flying around in officer fitted ruptures. we're sinking enough isk anyway. seriously though, have a look at the graphs again and look at the ops arguments. there isn't a huge amount of difference (sp effectiveness wise) between a 20-30mil player and a 70-100mil sp player.going back to your rifter/clone idea (but without the +2s). it costs the lower sp player maybe 26mil (5 x rifter, 3 x 100k clone). the higher sp player around 80 (5 x rifer, 3 x 20mil isk clone). srsly, 55mil isk difference?"
1/29/2010,"a new player has to raise 40k for a clone, if that. that's harmful?"
1/29/2010,"i thought that was nicer than saying that if you can't save your pod by the time you have 20 million skillpoints, you're an idiot. lesser of two evils, my good man, lesser of two evils.eve is a game of choice and consequence. if you have enough skill points that your clone is a cost consideration (and i mean a real one, not a lol-cost) then you (should) have been playing the game long enough to accurately evaluate the real costs of the activities you are about to undertake and make your choices appropriately. you want the choice without the (potential) consequences, and that is something i will never support."
1/29/2010,40k? your throwing a fit over 40k?dude.... i make that in 2 minutes and your throwing a fit over 40k!!?!not supporting. bloody hell... of all the stupid reasons.
1/29/2010,"we know how to save our pods thank you very much, but in 0.0 there are aoe warp scramblers that you can't escape and even if you escape you have a very risky road ahead to get to your new ship. if your opponent wants you podded, you will be podded. dying isn't the issue it is that the minimum cost of podding gets increased too much. this reduces your options you have as a player based just on your sp count.you talk about consequenses for my choices, but my only alternatives are to live with increased costs, never set foot in 0.0 or stop training my characters. why would you want to force those choices on people? how would allowing old characters to have low cost pvp fun be a bad thing for the game? to achieve this they will have to fly weaker ships and don't have any advantages over newer players flying the same ships. why would you want to exclude them from having low cost fun in cheap ships because of the amount of sp they have? it is the exact same choice a newer player can take, so should we remove the option from them too, since it is just a way to avoid potential consequenses?as you can see what we ask is for the same options to remain open to us as older characters as we had as newbs. the numbers in the op are a bit silly, but why is the idea that the cost level should be decided by the tools/items you use instead your age bad? if anything it would actually give you the option to be casual about your losses, if you choose to limit yourself in the equipment you use."
1/29/2010,poor excuse.i live in 0.0 with said risks and know all to well what happens out here.the costs are justified due to the sheer abilities you would have at that kind of sp count.that and you can make that isk very easily out here.you would know that if you did live out here.otherwise your not doing it right. : o phell i've made more isk out here in 0.0 than i would in high sec.... that says something.
1/29/2010,"it's pretty easy to live and make isk in 0.0, and to generally be a carebear/ratter and avoid getting podded. the point is, if you're actually pvp'ing in 0.0 as a higher sp character (taking risks/jumping into gate camps and bubbles - not just carebearing), the frequent podding/upgrading clones can end up costing too much for it to be worth it for some people. if i owned a 90 mil sp plus character and i wanted to fly t1 frigs in 0.0 (or for some reason didn't have enough isk to keep updating 20-30mil isk clones) i would probably just end up making a new character/alt to fly frigs with."
1/29/2010,excellent job on not reading the op. well done.
1/29/2010,"please explain how i get my pod away from a hic or warp bubble. and again, missing the point. we don't mind losing our pod, we mind paying 20-30mil per loss."
1/29/2010,go talk to goonswarm and pl and all those other bigshots and ask them how they do it.they will all tell you the same thing.. they go rat... mine.... build.... just like everyone else.you pvp... you don't make money.... that's your problem... not mine.you wana get down and dirty about cost? what about the ship? the mods? the insurance?clones are nothing to that.you have no business pvp'ing if you can't afford to replace your clone to begin with.
1/29/2010,"i'm just using the same criteria to evaluate the idea(the current medical clone cost) as all the new ideas we have here. the fact that this was implemented a long time ago doesn't make it any better. i agree in that you can make the isk relatively easily, but that is besides the point to a degree. there should be increased cost to a point, but i think it should be either capped there or stop the rediculously high rate of increase. the point is while the system does allow you to have increased ability, taking advantage of it is always tied to different kind of items. you have the same exact ability in those cheap ships as a guy whose clone cost pittance compared to yours. if you want to utilize your increased ability, you will need to utilize expensive gear/ships/implants. the loss and cost of them should be the primary risk associated with death. a cap on the cost also future proofs the system. now we have a decent amount of people well over 100 mil and eve shows no signs of dying soon. for them it's 30 mil isk per podding now and it will only get worse without any real benefit to the game or is there some reason to believe people will like grinding money more when they get so much sp? not to mention not everyone is rich and would like an option to keep the cost of losses to a minimum.what will things look 5 years from now when that is what a large portion of the players could have to pay and it is double to triple that to the most skilled. the real problem i have with it, and i know i'm repeating what i already said here, is that there is no good way to mitigate/reduce this cost. you are forced to pay it as a penalty for training your character too long. a minimum of 30, 65 or 90 mil loss for flying a t1 frigate with no advantages over younger pilots just because you kept training a single character. how does this make sense in any way?i'll repeat again that what the op proposed is just too little, but what reason is there to keep raising the clone cost indefinitely? why not a system where it is capped for example @30 mil isk at 120 mil sp mark. after that your clone can hold infinite amount of sp and that is it. no more upgrading your clone, just buying a new one after being podded. if you feel it is just too little for you, you will have the option to increase the risk and cost of death as high as you want, but are not forced to do that by an unavoidable game mechanic, that punishes having a high sp character. just because it was one of the earlier mechanics and isk sinks ccp thought of doesn't mean it isn't open to review."
1/29/2010,drake is an expert and well placed to comment on pvp.
1/29/2010,the way i see it... someone who has played that long will not have an issue when it comes to making isk... and will be smart enough to gauge the risks and not be so gutsy.with time comes experience... and experience is the thing that allows you to succeed with practice.so yes... i tend to agree its a bit of a sour taste but then i don't take risks to the point of ended up upside down financially either.---------do i look like i give a #### what you think when it comes to killboards?yay... you saw i've been podded what... twice in my entire time i've played this game?gee... lost some ships over the lifespan of playing eve... gee golly wizz.what does that mean? means i'm cautious... careful... obviously i'm industry.killed a few as well.good for you.... gold star for you.... now go away and let the grown ups talk.*oh yes... battle-clicic is the holy grail and authority on anyone's pvp skill yay!*

1/29/2010,"opposed, i don't want to be bothered by other players spam."
1/29/2010,"call me a carebear, a mission runner a loser, i do not care. i love missions. i love not getting killed. i love isk.i once said that if it weren't for missions and highsec, i wouldn't play this game. it's still true.every mmo i play, it's for the missions.i'm coming up to be able to fly a nighthawk, and i discover that i can't get a level 5 agent in highsec. it kinda makes me want to move on from eve, if i've exhausted the mission route and there's too much risk involved.can we have level 5s in highsec please?yours, uber carebearyes this is an alt."
1/29/2010,here's where you need to go.
1/29/2010,you can get lvl5s in highsec. it just takes some iterations of ask for mission/decline. but most of them will be in lowsec and many of them will be vs the other factions.and if you hope to do your lvl5s solo in a nighthawk it will be either a quick death (hello heavy neut towers) or take you ages. lvl5 are for groups of people.
1/29/2010,"thanks for the advice.it's the having to request from losec that bugs me. can get easily snagged outside the station while in 200m isk of implants.as for soloing.. my corpies regularly solo lvl5s in a nighthawk, but sometimes need help with the carrier. passive tank and missiles ftw vs heavy neut."
1/29/2010,"1. fly covops2. make insta undock spots (500+km suggested)help from a carrier is not soloing, further more the dps of a that highly tanked nighthawk is just embarrasing. doing lvl5s with 4-5 people is much more fun.with 10 people it kind of gets too easy, as you just obliterate the rats.also missioning in lowsec isnt all that difficult with some planning ahead and a scout or two."
1/29/2010,not supported.
1/29/2010,so join a corp that works to secure an area of lowsec from gankers so that you can run missions in relative safety.or you could sulk and threaten to quit the game because you don't understand isk vs risk i guess.

1/29/2010,correct me if wrong but arent lvl 4s still the better option for making isk?

1/29/2010,"""if someone shot my interceptor with an ammar dread, and missed, can i actually have him miss, instead of having a beam 5 times the size of my ceptor burning my ship for 10 seconds""i support everything you said, and definitly support this one ^^^^^^ !!!!!!!!!!""the second thing- when i shoot a titan with barrage of 8 missiles, all missiles do not just go and all hit the same window. i know that we are trying to make a hole in the ship, but when a 100 bs launch 8 missiles each, and all 800 missiles start hitting the same window, it looks wired.""this may be one should be one of the easiest changes for them to make, and i dont get why they havent done it yet, let the clients graphics process pick a random impact point for every shot/missle on the ship so that all fire isnt always hitting the exact same spot it looks fake and breaks immersion."
1/29/2010,"i agree with this possibly more than any other threaddifferntiating impact points on target and self is needed asap!!!!!!!!!!actually showing shots that miss as missed or glanced is really a needed change...its just nuts that these haven't been fixed/done yet.ability to disable ""visibility of remote self effects"" sounds good if it does in fact allow for large fleets to reduce some lag. maybe even enable a forced option that ccp can force this if grid goes over x amount of people."
1/29/2010,"i have been looking at the difference, cost and rarety of these items and i believe there needs to be a fix to 1 of the items to better fit it in the ore-items list. the ore-strip miner gives a bonus to mining amount and distance, making it worth what it sells for, yet the ore-ice harvester only gives a 2km distance bonus. this makes the item basically worthless since all you would need is a mining laser field enhancement link to increase the distance and no one is going to pay 200+m to just increase the distance 2km especially when they can buy a mining laser field enhancement link for 1m?. fixing this would give a bonus to the mining amount as well as distance putting it in line with the other ore-items and also making it worth buying. i am only suggesting this because the modulated strip miner ii's mining amount is 360m3, the ore-strip miner's is 540m3 and the distance increase, yet the ice harvester ii's mining amount is 1,000m3 and a distance of 10km, while the ore-ice harvester's is only an increase of 2km, no mining increase, making it worthless and not worth 200+m, thanks to the mining laser field enhancement link. it is an easy fix and it would again put it in line witht he rest of the ore-items, making it worth the price and making it sell.please fill free to either reply with [fix] or [no fix], may help eve decide on it being fixed or not. thanks"
1/29/2010,"umm you seem to hvae missed something dudestrip miner 1 = 540m3, ore strip miner = 540m3 modulated strip miner ii is 360 + crystal bonusore mining tools are the same amount as t1 but with range bonus, which i agree is useless in ice harvesting as who the hell ever moves to a different ice block when ice mining lol....personally i think that the ores should both be bumped to be > t1 but < t2 (with t2 crystals)so ... re-request this proposal with say ore harvester at 800m3and ore ice harvester with cycle time of say 525sthat way t2 beats them but requires the skills for it, but if you've got the cash you can still get a good bonus from the expensive ore devices, just not quite as good as skilling up for t2."
1/29/2010,"true, with crystals it bumps the amount, but if these items are going to be very hard to get and very expensive, then an increase in mining amount as well as the distance should be altered on all of them to better fit them in the game and actually make the worth as much as people are trying to get for them. i mean these items are very rare and very expensive, make them worth it then."
1/29/2010,"holy wall of text batman!so, you want the ""ore-ice harvester"" to have an increased yield and distance, making it worth the cost?ok 2 questions:1) ice comes in 1,000 m3 chunks. no more, no less. the smallest increment up would be 2,000 m3. you want these to have double the yield of a regular ice harvester?2) mining distance. just how far from the non-pop-able glaciers do you need to be? the point of the distance increase on a strip miner is to not have to move your barge so much as the roids pop. the ice cubes don't. last time i checked, when you mine ice, you find a spot, and you can sit there until downtime without moving. what would be the benefit to an increased mining distance?fill in some blanks here, and convince us why either of those are better/worth it."
1/29/2010,"you lost me here. the point isn't to make something fit with what people think they should be worth. it's to improve something within the game mechanics. not the market pvp sandbox.i'd go along with a cycle time decrease like lord helghast suggested. but otherwise, to adjust an item's stats to make it fit into the market....not supported."
1/29/2010,"so do you. they're called javelins, and let your torps hit at 45km. if you're gonna let the mega use null in your above example, you should have the raven use javelin aswell, and we're back where we started.erm, yes they do.i do think caldari suck, but it's not because of these reasons. 1. close range missile systems are fine, but, the close range caldari ships pretty much have something else they're lacking. for sr hacs, they're slow, for rr bs gangs, 3/4 races are perfect for armour tank while the last can make do as it while only 2/4 can shield tank well, and the others simply can't pull it off. therefore, rr bs gangs always rely on armour, where caldari can just barely make do (before you mention it, yes, the drake can be fitted to be very effective at close range, but even that roughly matches the other racial bcs). even if you do manage to get a pure minmatar/caldari gang, tackle is an issue.2. for long range, rails simply don't put out enough dps to be as effective as other races, and when sniping, you generally need to be able to kill a target quick before he has time to realize he's being targeted and warp out, so missiles don't work for 2 reasons: 1) if you shoot the primary, it will be dead/warped out before you hit and 2) if you shoot the secondary, they get an advance warning that they'll soon be primary and can warp out before all the turret bs that really can kill him before he can warp locks.so, what can be done? well, for close range, xl shield extenders to match the 1600mm plates would free up slots for tackle. for long range, the only thing i can really see working is to greatly reduce flight time, but in return boost velocity so that range stays about the same. that way missiles will be able to deliver the quick damage that is required for that gang type, and the thing making them different would instead be the tracking system. caldari can't really change their chance of hitting or how much damage they do, but they can do damage to targets that turret ships of their class can't track at all. in return, if the turret ship maneuvers properly, it can get in a position where it does full damage against that moving target while the missile ship still get a reduction."
1/29/2010,have you lost your marbles?
1/29/2010,if missiles get a tracking enhancer i want a missile tracking disruptor on a medium slot.
1/29/2010,that.
1/29/2010,"thats fine as long as we also get a high slot turret hardpointed , ""point defence system"" that can shoot railgun charges , projectiles and lasers outof the air before they hit my ship."
1/29/2010,oh you mean those lol useless defenders? when did you see the last person that fitted defenders and survived?
1/29/2010,"lol, okay. if you really want it, we'll grant you that useless piece of crap.or, better yet, just remove defender missiles entirely. no one uses them anyway."

1/29/2010,"do you guys play any other pc games? as i do and as i made my comp good enough to run those, eve was no problem, high all the way.but i like my games to look good, the last time i had an issue was when i played riven and then myst 3: exile came out, i tried the demo but is was so slow, i decided not to get the game until my computer could run it at a sufficient quality lvl.i'm sure you don't need that good a comp for eve, especially with prices nowadays"
1/29/2010,"alas, after a week or so this thread has not moved on at all. it's varying between complaints about procedure (""the original post does not contain a proposal"") and disagreement on principle (""i say that it is logical that you have to sacrifice a character when you buy a super-capital ship"").all of which seems somewhat to be missing the point of this forum, and to my mind oversteps the remit of the csm - they are here as representatives, not judges. i would suggest that somebody starts a new thread, with a proposal we can vote on, and see if it gets any support (say, ""make super-capitals anchorable"", with a detailed description of the mechanics). if it gets no support, then it's dead, that's the way it should be, not a bunch of people killing it off for their own purposes.if all else fails, support this thread instead:"
1/29/2010,"anchoring seems like a sensible suggestion to me, the deployable anchorage structure even better. having them disappear from the game with a parking valet alt is ridiculous for such epic scale ships.i would go much further, i always found it rather odd that these super capital titan ships are so regularly/readily destroyed. eve could be made more epic by introducing an intermediate state, disabled. this could perhaps be like forcing a pos into re-enforced mode. the owning faction could have the opportunity to rescue/salvage the titan, the attacking faction the opportunity to finish the job. this could lead to some epic struggles.also allowing the bumping of titans is silly.i have no personal interest in this, any kind of super capital or titan is long way off for me.csm are supposed to be player representatives, i find it more than a little disturbing they are trying to drown out the obvious majority opinion because it doesn't serve their own interests."
1/29/2010,"i'm not forced to eat either - but the consequences of not doing so are a bit dire.the options as they currently stand are either eat at the 'alt' table or starve in a supercap you can do virtually nothing in, making the game essentially unplayable with that character for large amounts of time.that is, effectively, 'you must have an alt or you cannot play.' pretty it up all you like, that's what you're saying. okay - let's follow your argument here. you've admitted it cannot be safely parked without an alt. we agree that sitting in one limits play in extreme ways to the point where most of the time all you can do is sit in the thing, not play the game.you'll disagree of course, because you simply don't like to admit that reality but to anyone reasonable that's ""you must have an alt or the game is unplayable.""that is the reason for the request for the change, yes. without an alt the 'consequences' you speak of mean that you log on and spend most of the evening staring at a ship in space doing nothing. even ratting is pointless as you can no longer do anything with the isk. i find it astonishing that you think that this is a reasonable situation.you clearly prefer the status quo, for whatever reason (you haven't actually said why you don't like the idea of something as simple as allowing the anchoring of a ship or improving pos security) instead you just spout things about consequences which aren't really consequences at all if, like most eve players, you metagame.when you make a list of arguments are so far from the reality of how the game you are supposed to be experienced in is played, what possible other response is there?you may believe otherwise, but you have come across as dismissive and condescending from your very first post. everything you have written basically came down to 'i'm not really interested in anything you have to say - i don't like your idea and i'm going to try and belittle it with nonsense in hopes that no one supports it.' if that wasn't your intent, well you will notice that i am not the only one you gave that impression to."
1/29/2010,"how about this for a solution, its based the premise that you are able to issue a remote command to the super cap ship1. you warp to a safe spot2. you exit the ship3. you are able to execute a command (from your pod) to make the ship to use its jump drive to jump to a random spot in its jump range (like an interstellar safe spot). no cyno required here as the destination is not defined.4. the ship jumps out of the star system, and is obviously not scannable to steal as normal ships can't access interstellar space.5. to get the ship back, go back to where you left it and issue the remote command to make it jump back. only the pilot that sent it off can make it return. a cyno is required here as you are bringing it to a defined destination.or alternatively there could be some sort of password system required to make the ship jump back, so other corp members could bring it back.this would require some kind of bookmark that was recorded on the pilots journal, like a mission location.please commence rubbishing of idea."
1/29/2010,"firstly requiring people to use this forum correctly should not be an issue, there is even a sticky at the top!for some reason me simply pointing this out is trolling, rude, condescending or whatever...i'll stop you there. have you read the csm devblog or the summary?a couple of relevant quoteswhilst you are correct that we are representatives it is also pretty clear that the csm members are supposed to also filter the issues/proposals raised by the players, discuss them and vote on which ones to pass to ccp.we are not judges as such, more correctly we are an elected council of peers who have been tasked with filtering the proposals before they go to ccp.what you will spot is that at no point does it require csm members to actively discuss ideas with other players! i could raise proposals to the csm and then simply vote them down without having the aggravation of being flamed for daring to point out my concerns before hand .on the subject of support:this thread has been up a week and has only managed to gain seven supporters (edit: eight now). the new thread you suggest somebody raise has been up for two days and so far has zero support (not even the proposer supports it?) but did attempt to sling mud at me 3 or 4 times.on the subject of ""a bunch of people killing [the proposal] off for their own purposes"":exactly two out of nine csm reps replied to this thread with their concerns. two is a bunch? if the proposal is to succeed it only needs 5 of the csm to agree to it (providing it gains the required level of support to get on the agenda in the first place).i take my csm responsibilities seriously, witness the effort i am putting in with the minutes as well as actually posting in this forum (even though people might wish i wouldn't because i disagree with them ) but there is a huge public relations mountain to climb due to previous csm behaviour as well as current csm attendance and the long lead time from csm approval to ccp implementation of features.however, i will step out of the argument because nothing i can say as a member of the csm will be considered unbiased even if it isn't"

1/29/2010,"yeah its lame. i'm generally anti-lame so i support this or something like it. i never played wow so i don't know, or care, how this compares to wow. arenas are ok for the alliance tournament and it seems people in big alliances enjoy that. why can't others do this or something similar? or are we going to get some proposals that the alliance tournaments should end because they are too much like wow?"
1/29/2010,"the alliance tourney gives away hundreds of billions of isk worth of free ships, that ccp spawns specifically for the purpose, to whoever wins it. i think that in that case, there's nothing wrong with taking steps to ensure the integrity of the tournament environment. a random 1v1 is simply not the same situation."

1/29/2010,"this is not wow - a single player game giving lip service to some multiplayer aspects.this is eve. if you want some kind of 1v1 on demand, join an alliance and ask someone for a fight.the op's idea will be horribly exploited and non-functional three seconds after it is released.what you want: a feel good, kill-a-noob, or a fair 1v1 fight.what you will get: noobs who will get killed 50 times in a day then quit the game - interspersed with players in ecm/neut-heavy ships.you aren't going to get fair fights. you will hate it. there will be a non-stop crying and gnashing of teeth over it, as no one will ever be satisfied with it, because everyone complains a fight was ""not fair"" in some way when they die. ccp will have 50,000 petitions a day titled ""omg hax"" because of it. an arena in eve will not work."
1/29/2010,"recently, ccp has been trying to cover up ""the larkonisgate scandal"". ingame, his csm 3 medal was removed from his character, despite larkonis's dedication to the csm. many of the players proprosals were voted in by larkonis, and he helped change eve-online for the greater good. he was voted into the csm by the community, and therefor deserves his medal, unlike others who weren't voted in, yet were defaulted a medal because of larkonisgate.not only this, but it appears ccp are trying to airbrush this whole incident from history. on their wiki, larkonis has been apparantly removed from the equation altogether. personally, i think this is poor form by ccp, who gave so much to the csm, and in return recieved so little.the least that can be done to rectify this situation is the restore larkonis's name to the wiki record, and give him back his ingame medal for his services."
1/29/2010,yes... because it is perfectly acceptable for players to break non-disclosure agreements/contracts and get off scott free (as far as being perma-banned).emphatic thumbs down

1/29/2010,"larkonis is an independant bastion of strength, honour and justice in an otherwise dull and bleak universe"
1/29/2010,re-read my post.i said nda/contract.he was not supposed to act on that information therefore he broke the nda.i suggest you learn to read before you post... less embarrassing.
1/29/2010,"what is it with larkonis fan club that they feel the need to whitewash what he did?i swear it's like watching a bunch of politicians trying to define the words ""sexual relations"" all over again."
1/29/2010,"yeah well, doesn't mean he should be wiped from the official eve history books now, does it?"
1/29/2010,he signed an nda. he didn't disclose anything.what exactly are you trying to say?
1/29/2010,"a typical nda also includes a clause stating that you will not use the information for personal gain. and to counter your next argument, since isk can be traded for game time via plexes it does have a real world value, and thus can be included in the ""for personal gain"" argument."
1/29/2010,stick to the rules if you want a shiney medal.
1/29/2010,have you actually read the csm nda?it's quite clear that you haven't.
1/29/2010,oh i'm sorry i didn't realise you also read the nda that larkonis signed. i'll be more careful in the future to ensure i don't make that mistake.and you can't trade isk for $$$. how does that give it real world value? and how come plex scamming is allowed? because it's an ingame item. it has nothing to do with the real world.edit: getting slightly off topic here btw
1/29/2010,"not sure about giving him his medal back but wtf removing him from the wiki. eve should be proud to have the odd scandal, it makes for interesting history and makes it look more like a proper democracy."
1/29/2010,what's the tl;dr on whatever he did?
1/29/2010,used his knowledge to buy out stuff that would get more valuable with the changes ccp was planning.
1/29/2010,the terrible irony is that it got less valuable.
1/29/2010,ouch
1/29/2010,"stop being an idiot on purpose. it's not helping your argument.we get it that you're a lark fanboi, and that's fine - some of us feel that our csm members should hold themselves to a higher standard of behavior, which is why we're disagreeing with your proposal. but don't throw attitude at us when we use examples to show why you're wrong. an nda is a standard legal document - ccp didn't invent them, and having signed quite a few of them myself, i can tell you more or less what's included.the clause for personal gain is included to prevent you from using any information you may encounter in your activities under the agreement in a manner that would give you a tangible benefit. since isk can be used to buy game time (as i pointed out), lark's use of the information could enable him to acquire game time in a manner not available to every other player in the game, and that's the key point. yes you can scam plex - and anyone else in the game can try the same tactic to get free game time. lark's actions enabled him to be able to acquire that game time in a manner not available to everyone because it was based on knowledge not yet available to the wider player base (in essence, he engaged in insider trading)."
1/29/2010,well you that is bad luck on top.
1/29/2010,obvious troll is obvious
1/29/2010,"i guess we all know what he did wrong. most of us do, at least. the question is whether he should be wiped from the history books for it and getting his shiny medal taken away; like a referee dropping by your house to collect your soccer trophies after you got sent off in your latest match."
1/29/2010,"no, it's more like the olympic comittie revoking your medal because they found out you cheated during the olympics and that was why you won."
1/29/2010,"considering the charm of eve in terms of significance is it's single shard ""what happens, happens to all"", the attempt to mask a part of its history like this is pretty pathetic. lark may have been underhanded in his insider trading efforts but considering that is entirely within the spirits of the games ethics, it's a disappointment in the least to see ccp trying to rewrite the history books."
1/29/2010,thisran - what is this... be stupid day? derp derp?if we wanted him wiped from history... we wouldn't be bringing it up now would we?
1/29/2010,"that is a poor analogy dear, even from you. perhaps if i had been found to have somehow subverted the datebase during the actual election that would be more fitting.i was most upset to discover that my medal had been removed, but not so upset as to protest about it on the forums. i'm afraid shigsy is merely trying to express his love for me by trying to do me a good turn.edit: adding my support anyway."
1/29/2010,supporting because lark made a few videos i enjoyed
1/29/2010,"he should get his place back on the wiki. simple history is not changed by a moment of stupid. the medal, not so much - that's a fair thing to strip."
1/29/2010,he was a volunteer trying to improve everyones gameplay and he used some information (like all of us would don't lie) to make a little isk for himself. it simple corruption and it happens all the time. plus for people saying he had an unfair advantage he didn't you try getting the reputation to be able to win csm election its probably not easy.
1/29/2010,"the whole larkonisgate deal is a bit odd. so the csm can't let anything they learn effect what they do in game? is this true of ccp employees?so if i was planning on buying billions worth of warp core stabilizers before i'm on the csm but then after a csm meeting find out ccp is likely to nerf warp core stabilizers - i'm still duty bound to buy billions worth of them? if i don't i'm in breach of a nondisclosure agreement? i would like to see the agreement(s)csm members need to sign.i find it ironic that the csm was created because ccp lost the faith of the players when their own employees where very blatantly cheating (flat out spawning blue prints!) in their own game. (which by the way does have a tie in with real money) we get no repercussions against that employee yet ccp ends turning the tables against a player in csm who supposedly didn't properly pretend he didn't hear stuff he heard. its getting reversed like in soviet russia.i'm not in favor of dirty rotten contract breachers, nor do i like dishonesty, but these rules seem far from clear. we can see ccp is quick to tighten the reigns on this organization which was created due to ccp employee cheating but what about the original intent of the csm? i will also say my *hunch* is that larconis had to be very honest about his motivations or ccp would have had a tough time proving anything."
1/29/2010,lark bought goods up after he found out... not before... not way before... he didn't have a bloody stockpile.come on people... sheesh.don't you think he'd gone after them legally if that wasn't the case?that's called entrapment.... not something ccp would pull considering./me epic facepalm
1/29/2010,"emphatic thumbs down.i think ccp was far too kind to him and he should have been permabanned for that (it was too minor for real world legal action, but that would not have been inappropriate, just wasteful).and to those who think that nothing was 'revealed' the market is a public place. when someone buys or sells something from you it shows in your transaction journal. therefore, anyone who was transacting with larkonis would immediately know what he was transacting and how much and, knowing he was a csm it's not rocket science to conclude, if the transactions were at all unusual (and they were - otherwise he wouldn't have gotten caught) then what was going to take place was publicly revealed to anyone who happened to look.and yes, ndas also have (as a standard clause) a 'you may not benefit from this info outside of the benefits stated in this contract' clause.having done a bunch of stuff for a couple of major game companies and worked in the industry for awhile, i've had to read and sign a few over the years. they're pretty standard in the base particulars.oh, and a former csm confirmed that clauses were broken (which just puts the cherry on top).i don't hate lark or anything, although i don't agree with him on just about anything either - but i still believe he got off far too lightly."
1/29/2010,"so what? in my case you would be changing your actions after you hear from the csm as well.i don't know what you are talking about here, and i have a hunch you don't either. ;)"

1/29/2010,"i want to propose the ability to install defensive posts in soverignty enabled systems. basically beyond just pos bubbles with guns, the ability for a soverignty system to install gate guns and gate launchers in their systems at gates (to defend against pirates and against sbu teams etc)basically like the current military levels etc, either tie it to the military level or a new level, that will allow you to ""upgrade"" the pg/cpu of the gate, and install guns/launchers like a pos, ecm wouldn't be allowed as i think that would be over-powerful as someone roaming into a system would be locked down with no chance to escape. and note im not suggesting the ability for a gate to have ""death star style defenses"" lol, but at say military v the ability to have 5-6 gate guns or something like that... and if military falls below the needed level the pg/cpu drops and necessary guns are offlined.also if this is done you might be asking ""who would the gate guns fire at"" well i believe this should be just like pos set via the gate management to alliance/corp/or standing based."
1/29/2010,"not supported. 0.0 is lawless, defend it yourself. sentry guns on gates and stations would ruin small-gang pvp and guerrilla warfare."
1/29/2010,this was supposed to be implemented when dominion came out. for whatever reason they removed. (not because it's lawless... poor excuse)at a certain degree of cost of course... as you increased your military index.supported.
1/29/2010,"nullsec isnt lawless, its just not concord protected and patrolled, its governed and protected by its own soverignty holders, why shouldnt they get some offline defenses for their territories.how does it kill the roaming gang? pirates are mostly lowsec, roaming nullsec gangs just need to get away from the gate fast or tank them, as they already know they can do in highsec experience...also considering a proper defense military v requires actual work to maintain, its not like every system in regions would have it, mostly just the capitals... and shouldnt capitals be defended? roaming pirate gangs are fine, but roaming pirate gangs that can warp through a capital and try to sneak past without worrying about anything is stupid.!supported!"
1/29/2010,"so what you're saying is that cruisers and frigates should be nerfed into uselessness anywhere near a station or gate :sforcing roaming gangs to fit for tanking gate guns will kill small ship warfare, if you want that style of play then go to low sec."
1/29/2010,you want gate guns. go to lowsec.you want nullsec. defend yourself.not supported.
1/29/2010,"yes, but not like low sec gate guns, they shouldnt instapop ceptors, they should be able to prevent a lone ceptor from camping a gate."
1/29/2010,"i support it as gate guns have appropriate price tag, dps and power (no infinite tanking fr instant vaporisation of small targets like in low-sec) the automated defences should be fairly limited, and provide a little support, not ultimate protection. they would make the ssytems you own slightly safer for you, not safe. it makes snece though as long as kept balanced. guns on outposts should be twice or more powerfull then on gates. gate guns should not vaporise random travelers, but unless you got a formidable fleet you should not be coming anywhere near enemy outpost- the most expensive and important thing in the system. after all, you cannot camp people in there poses, why should you be able to camp a station so easy? ofcource, the guns can be vaporised given enough firepower, like pos-guns they would go off-line after being taken in hull. so a fleet camping hostile gate would offline them (or blow them up if they need to) and continue camping."
1/29/2010,"perhaps ""small ship warfare"" shouldn't exist in populated 0.0 systems? they are already referred to as t1 suicide gangs because of how quickly they are destroyed when they suicide into populated systems. their purpose is to annoy other players more than anything. it costs almost nothing to throw suicide fleets at an alliance, but forces them to call up a defensive fleet every time. this isn't a good balance. in fact, the current mechanic rewards players for throwing suicide alt fleets around. it borders on griefing to throw a suicide fleet at another alliance every 15-30 minutes.as long as the gate guns don't instalock (preventing cloaking ships from cloaking) or have the ability to track a ceptor, gate guns should exist in populated sov space. basically, it shouldn't kill a scout, but it should hurt suicide gangs."
1/29/2010,"sure, if you removed them from lowsec gates."

1/29/2010,this shouldn't protect 0.0 carebears.
1/29/2010,"i could accept having a sov upgrade that gave gates pg to anchor pos guns. they shouldn't get lowsec perfect-tracking gate guns, but for a sufficient cost, some fixed defences would be fine."
1/29/2010,"so whom will it protect? the roaming gang camping your system?or do you need your pvpers some protection?compared to the roaming gang you already got the infrastructure advantage (pos, outpost) and now you would get some extra dps when fighting them on the outpost or gate?sounds ""balanced"" to me."
1/29/2010,"no, it should reduce the suicide gang griefing. the risk/reward is heavily skewed towards throwing a handful of t1 ships at someone's sov space constantly, and people do this."
1/29/2010,"i always thought thats why people go to nullsec. to get the fights over system, having epic battles without worrying about sec status. no?"
1/29/2010,"shooting the same 4 pilots in the same 4 t1 frigates every 15-30 minutes is far from epic. allowing people to fit a small pos gun on their gates would go unnoticed by a normal gang, let alone an ""epic"" fleet. especially if the gun can be incapped/destroyed."
1/29/2010,0.0 carebears are even worse than lvl4 runners.
1/29/2010,wow you have to fight in your space. if you dont like it go to empire or dock up as the other carebears.a few pos guns on a gate nuking support will be noticed. it is still dps you dont have to bring for a fight. it is still dps you dont have to fc during the fight. it might be enough to drive of some tackle or logistics during a fight. something you couldnt have achieved otherwise as your focus was elsewhere.
1/29/2010,"the idea is that people go to 0.0 to live there, but what some like you seem to prefer is that people go to 0.0 only to fight, and stick to high sev lvl 4 missions for income. would also mean that there wont be much roaming left to do."
1/29/2010,"there is a difference between ships coming for a fight and spamming an alliance with suicide gangs. darius, what alliance are you in that you are either unfamiliar with or do not want to lose this tactic? from your retorts, it sounds like you lack some pretty basic pvp experience. a few small pos guns can't nuke support unless they are idiots - a single frigate would have to turn on the mwd and sit still to die. i think 1-2 guns is all that should be allowed anyway. small pos guns do about 100-150 dps per gun and have a fairly poor tracking. if your pvp gang can't handle that, they should go back to mining."
1/29/2010,"do you even live in 0.0? this would destroy small gang, frig - cruiser gang, and solo roaming in 0.0automation is not the way to defend your space. we want players versus players, absolutely not supported."
1/29/2010,"ahh so you vote to disable pos auto defense as well, since automation is stupid apparently? cause apparently thats what seems to be what your suggesting, no one suggested outpost guns, tho non automated outpost guns do sound cool lol..."
1/29/2010,"ahh yes hope, lets hope that enemys of which ever alliance is defending or attacking a system just dont show up in force. because we spend hours of gameplay and alot of money in monthly fees to hope that the enemy wont bring their full force to defend / attack. yes i may be complaining a bit but what im saying is this is still an unfair factor to the victem regardless of whos side hes on and untill ccp have found a soloution to this problem, which is their problem and not the players, reimbursements should be handed out to those who are the are on the receivng end of this horirble factor, it makes me feel as long as we are paying our fees ccp are happy to say no, because they expect us to pay more fees to be able to play long enough to 'get a new ship' and 'hope' that in the next big fight the same problem wont happen again. then ofcourse it does and the process is repeated, wether our side wins or looses, their is always someone that has to go through this issue and these are the people that should be reimbursed, this is a topic against your reimbursement policies as much as it is your lag issues."
1/29/2010,"i strongly suspect ccp is aware of problems caused by lag, as is every single online game company in the world. i for one am amazed that you can pack 1,000 ships into the same grid without complete failure; there are many o(n^2) (number of operations needed to complete a task is proportional to the square of the number of users) tasks involved.eve is a sandbox, and ccp will never say ""you can't bring more than x players to a fight"". players will always try to outnumber the other team, until the point at which lag makes the game unplayable. if you don't want laggy fights, don't go to a huge fleet fight. you are setting yourself up for disappointment."
1/29/2010,ccp set these fights up with the new dominion set up...if fleet a places sbu's with 500 ships as back...fleet b has to have the same amount of ships(at least)...ridiculous to complain that we shouldn't bring these numbers of ships to a fight...when ccp set up these mechanics.
1/29/2010,"this isn't lag anymore, it's broken and unusable mechanics. it is clear by now that this is not going to be fixed any time soon. what ccp has now isn't even in the save universe as what they are advertising all over the internet. for them to presume that they can continue to develop their way out of these issues at the expense of some of their customers is unacceptable."
1/29/2010,so how many cva+pets have been on the mass testing event?
1/29/2010,i'm pretty sure your inability to format is the problem here.ccp knows about the lag - i'm sure they've heard. more assembly hall posts oughta speed 'em up ;)
1/29/2010,"you're a troll. plain and simple. if ccp would like to, they just could read news and watch the community. we don't need mass testing events for this. there are plenty of fights happening which are bigger than a mass testing event ever could be.the lag, sooner or later will kill this game. also with the new mechanics ccp didn't managed to think it through and see why it happens that over a thousand people mass thereself on a single point of interest.the only useful answer till yet in this thread was the one of ""camios"". he's suggesting to split the fights. this could be a good solution.in eve it was always a problem that while we have open space we are limited to single points of interest (celestials).and this is because ccp don't allow us to free flight in our space. we can't put up stations where we want to and everything we build is immediately on our overview. there is no strategy needed in this game. only thing that counts is ""mass"". the most interesting fights are when five people move somewhere and other five people find them by coincidence. lagfree and it's not looking like someone set it up. the new sov-mechanics solved no problems. we are also still shooting pos and due to absolutely crappy modules, the pos has no chance to defend itself. it's just a joke and has nothing to do with starships and the very well made video advertisements we see in front of every expansion.cheersspeedcat"
1/29/2010,if only something like this had happened just a few weeks ago and you had learned from it.
1/29/2010,"so i heard that ccp always strive to keep the server at optimum performance and regularly upgrade their hardware and code, however, in situations such as fleet battles they cannot always achieve this goal. it is impossible for them to measure how much lag each person has and even harder to verify which losses were the result of lag and which losses were legit. reimbursing losses from large battles due to possible lag which is unverifiable from their end, would in essence mean removing the risk of loss from fleet battles entirely and thereby nullify their whole purpose. i am sorry that they cannot assist you and i hope you understand their stance on this matter."
1/29/2010,"yes it is definitely trolling to point out that ccp is actively working on it.if you would have taken the time to read the postings, you would have known that they ran some code with debugging enabled to get the data they needed. something you cant do on tq without making the normal performance worse.you wanted to have your fleet fight today with debug code?and as viper said ... you didnt learn from wi. vs atlas, you didnt learn from pl/goons vs it in y-2. repeat their errors and come to the forums and cry.yes this will definitely help to solve the problem."
1/29/2010,"yes, there are too many topics on the forum about lag, 'ohh it was laggy and i died' 'i shouldent even move' etc etc, yes this post adresses that but what it also adresses is the -no reimburse due to lag thing they have going on at the moment.i'm thinking if ccp claim know exactly what the problem is why are they not reimbursing ships to the pople that loose them in these conditions. i would die smiling if only i could go down swinging, but i cant even die whilst watching my enemy shoot me, this deserves reimbursement, maybe if you started giving ships back to the victems of this mess ccp you wouldent have x ammount of people saying they are on the brink of stopping paying for their subscriptions untill the matter is solved,"
1/29/2010,"dominion is obviously flawed, hoping for a speedy recovery."
1/29/2010,"i forgot, ccp magically fixes problems. they simply need to know a problem exists. then, without any idea why the problem occurs, presses the big, red, magic ""fix it"" button and magic fairies sprinkle pixie dust on the server and all is better.in good, scientific method, style, ccp has been attempting to test the problem in a controlled environment so they can identify the bottleneck and fix it. unfortunately, they picked a dumb time to run a test requiring a good turnout. they continue to rely on players to spread the word on when a test is going to happen. i can understand a complaint about the time of the tests and/or how much effort ccp has put into trying to make the player base aware of the test. i cannot understand complaining about ccp's magic wand not working."
1/29/2010,"buy 1000 tritanium, now make stacks of 1. tada! instant invisible cargo."
1/29/2010,"i support this request, and this above feature wud be wicked, counter scanner equipment!"
1/29/2010,"counter scanner + ability to view market details, sounds good to me"
1/29/2010,seriously this is dead already stop it. 1. this has been said before warping missiles are like fighter drones without having to train for or buy a carrier (this eve not wow and things take time)2. in a fleet fight target all missiles on the secondary target not the primary target.that way you dont loose dps as the missile boats always fire on the secondary and another nice little thing. you automatically spread out the enemies logistic power.there now i solved the problem for you. now stop whining about missiles and making suggestions that would make them overpowered.
1/29/2010,"the only drawback to this is that cruise missiles generally do superior dps to turret ships setup to shoot that far.. so maybe we should introduce special warp enabled guided missiles, they would still have their base range limitations that are currently implemented (would only be a factor for light/heavy really but i don't think frigates should be shooting lights 250km away) but could strike from long distance.. of course having an onboard warp engine would mean a smaller warhead and less damage output.. but if a raven or typhoon for example with guided warp missiles could do ~300dps from 220km that would be kinda nice and mean people can bring missile ships to fleets.you are really good at reading. :)and as far as missile re-targeting.. yes cruise missiles do higher dps vs battleships than turrets however the ~20 seconds delay does make them rather unusable in fleets."
1/29/2010,"perhaps some t2 missiles which would be instant damage (like turrets), but instead offer lower damage (lower than turrets, but not to the point of uselessness).you could also give them insanely low explosion velocity, so you it would only be able to hit near-stationary targets.also, your name ftw."
1/29/2010,"i like #1, but i agree, this should require a missle upgrade in a med/low spot for ""autotargetting missle guide""#2 i like the idea of adding a new type of guided warp missle, that is unable to fire at <150km so range skills wud take 150km as 0km and calc range from their for their actual distance."
1/29/2010,"missile retargeting with a module (autotargeting missile computer, in a low med spot) sounds like a good idea, not so sure about guided warp missles they would have to be balanced.and no they wouldn't replace fighters, their 1 missile and they can only hit things on grid just over 150km.they wont be able to ""follow a target into warp"", if they did follow a target into warp they better have a much lower dps"
1/29/2010,"supported definitly, would also like to see the 5m limit removed from assembly hall votes.also , i suggest inthe assembly hall forced voting, if your going to leave a comment you must check ""neutral"" ""pro"" ""con"" that way people that are pro dont accidentally leave it neutral"
1/29/2010,"clearly something needs to change.one issue that i have when i vote (and i always do) is that getting a real handle on the positions of the candidates is difficult. some were easy choices, this last one was incredibly hard as i couldn't find a single candidate that i felt would represent anything like the majority of my opinions about things that need work in the game.since that's the point of the organization, that's an issue.this is the 21st century. we can fix that, we have the technology.let's start with some basic ideas. first of all, we want to know what the candidates stand for. this should be readily available information. when someone tosses their hat in the csm ring they should be required to fill out a form on their views which should then be available as a summary for all candidates in a simple chart.this could be broken up into various sections of the game. for instance:suicide ganking: 1-10where 10 is ""everyone should be doing it"" and 1 is ""doing it should get you banned"". 5 is ""current status quo is fine"". someone then looking at a candidate could then see their stance on suicide ganking and know if they feel it should be made easier, harder or stay the same.these are very very general views, naturally, and reading what the candidate has to say on them would be important. but it at least lets you filter the candidates down to five or six you can really study who are closest to your own views. you could even take the survey yourself (the same survey) and have the system rank the candidates in order from how close their opinion matches yours to how far away they are either on a specific issue or a specific subset of issues (high sec matters etc.) or overall with all topics.another thing - we have certificates now. characters running for csm should temporarily have their certificates made public as part of their campaign. that will give some idea of their ability in-game.finally things like their sec status and standings should be made public.yes - this means running for csm throws a very public spotlight on you. good. you want the job, you get the limelight for all the good and ill that comes with.these things would, i think, increase voting in the csm. in fact, perhaps taking the survey and viewing the candidates should be something put up at log-in as part of the game. yes, those who don't care could simply press ""spoil ballot"" and get on with the game but it would raise the interest of many players and get them thinking. each candidate, in addition to their ratings and public stats, could have a short (maybe 1000 words) statement of their main platform and what they wish to help ccp focus on and accomplish.are these a panacea? no, of course not. but they are tools that would improve, i believe, participation in csm elections. right now everyone just says, ""well, there will be goons and some big alliance people and maybe a single token carebear who will get ignored"" and don't bother to vote.perhaps, with better tools and more visibility to the population of new eden as a whole, we might see better representation. perhaps even a carebear dominated council? wouldn't that be an odd thing?i don't want to see any part of eve ignored. high sec, low sec, and null sec are all integral parts of the game and all need more love. as a player, i often joke about loathing pirates - and yet we need them in eve and they need more attention to make their careers better and viable. without bad guys, who would the good guys fight? where's the excitement?every part of the game has areas that need work. what's important is making the voice of the players known to ccp, not just the voice of a few special interest groups with too much ability to emphasize that voice under the current system.there's my .02 isk on things."
1/29/2010,"did you see vote match during the last csm elections? it isn't quite what you suggest but was a pretty good idea.i wouldn't have a problem with this, but it really only shows their ability to train various skills. e.g. my main has a raft of skills from when i was learning the game that mean nothing (industrial and trade skills that would make me out to be a trading expert when i've only used them a handful of times).they are already public. open people and places, search for character, show info, view sec status and standings. it would be easier to have it in one place of course, but somebody could have provided it just as dierdra vaal provided vote match. i would like to see some of these things in a future election portal along with the ability to vote in game (via the igb would be fine)there was a box for this on the candidate list where the campaign statement from the csm application was put. some people decided to leave it blank or put in a ""lol"" type answer. however it was never stated that the box could have html formatting (the apps were sent via email) and ccp never updated the text when asked so it became of limited use.the bigger alliances have the muscle to get somebody (or in the goons case 2 people) voted in, but that is mostly down to the well organised nature of alliances. ok, well organised might be a stretch in some cases but the point is they are generally loyal to their own members.carebears are frequently solo or small corp focussed and as a whole lack the organisational structure to bloc vote even though clearly they could have pushed in a few candidates if they wanted to.many of us didn't have the benefit of thousands of guaranteed alliance votes (my alliance have about 150 people) so they actually had to campaign. this at least demonstrates a level of commitment even if you don't agree with the platform they run on.as i wanted to be proactive i took advantage of vote match, i did live debates on split infinity radio (as did 3 other people in the csm and one of the alternates). i also taught pvp classes with agony and a guest lecture spot with eve university. i blogged, tweeted and directly interacted with the voters to answer questions etc.i put in the effort and was lucky to get enough people to support me, which is why i take the responsibility seriously and put in the time to discuss issues (as well as taking on a very time consuming role.the current system does not value the commitment a csm member is willing to (or does) put in which should probably be looked at..."
1/29/2010,"i did, but at the time i tried it couldn't get it to work properly. might have been browser settings, not sure. i thought it a good concept but, since the darned thing wouldn't work for me, lacking in execution.i know - i have some i don't use as well. it's good to have something to go on though, and with the closure of ghost training there is less training of skills folks don't plan to use, at least on newer characters. it's not perfect (heck nothing is) but it's more info to go on. i know, but wading through it all for thirty candidates, writing it all down etc. - just too finicky for most to bother. (i only checked the 3-4 of the folks i personally considered for my vote - and that means i may have missed something important).well, now that the igb actually works (well, mostly anyway certainly light years better than previously).in the real world governments put out a lot of effort for voting. the system we have works, after a fashion, but there is a lot of room for improvement.completely agree. the hard part is quantifying it in some way that isn't open to folks saying 'the csm is just making themselves look real good'.i think a record of work put in (in some fashion) number of meetings attended/missed and the person's voting record should be summarized somewhere, again, easily accessible without tons of digging.voters are, by and large, kind of lazy. that's human nature. i research who i vote for but even *i'm* lazier than i should be by my own standards. even so i'm sure i do more than most folks who vote for the person they know, or on party lines etc. it's why incumbents in the real world have such a huge advantage."
1/29/2010,"a) which is why i addressed you concerns in my post.b) also addressed in the post. i think isk sinks should be service based rather then product based. if there aren't enough ""services"" in which to sink them then make some up. fixing or eliminating insurance (not going to happen) would go a large way to helping the isk problem for instance.c) which makes it a rather poor form for removing isk from the game."
1/29/2010,"again ""pay the crew to fly the ship"" while good for immersion could break the game for people low on isk. what part of ""pay to fly is bad"" are you missing?fly a frigate they have no crew is a very weak reply. you want to do level 1 missions or kill frigate sized targets to pay for you pvp ships?you want to discover that you have finished the isk midway during a fleet op and that you crew has gone on strike?be unable to dock the ship you are using (the docking fees you suggested) and unable to pay the crew while you stay in space?what sould be the effect? ship dead on water? your pod ejected in space as soon as you are incapable of paying the crew?"
1/29/2010,"what i am having trouble understanding is why you are cherry picking things to argue with from my post, using red herrings and continuing on a track entirely superfluous to the op.how is that different from now then?although you conveniently ignored it i already suggested rolling the fees together in to one. perhaps instead of paying to dock you pay to undock based on ship type or ship hull. there are so many solutions it<U+FFFD>s not that hard to come up with them.covered by my previous sentence but also covered in the post you quoted from. home base is free to dock etc.debt? forget the crew fee and go for one undocking fee that ""covers"" that cost? live with the consequences of flying a ship without having bothered to make sure you can afford it and pod home? make some other entirely unrelated isk sink?i really think you are imagining fee's far higher then reasonable. and your arguments are entirely spurious and disingenuous, you are perfectly capable of thinking of all the various solutions to the problems you present. if i were to make an actual proposal on this board then i'd be sure to consider all of these things and present a complete picture of what i envision. again the really point i was making, which is related to the op, is that alternative isk sinks can be found and that products players buy can be left to players to manufacture."
1/29/2010,"i have to support this, in my opinion eve shud allow for 100% to be buildable by the industrialists...make nanite repair paste very wasteful, and components be costly, so taht prices stay high, not having a bpo is stupid to say because they want to keep costs high, they can keep costs high with a bpo still, just make the ingrediants cost the same as current trit/nocx etc so that it can be produced for ~ the same amount of cost, well a little cheaper at prod eff v, due to heavy waste on the bpo"
1/29/2010,"give industrialists more to build, why keep it in npc hands, eve's #1 industrial reason is that its all maintained and continues to prosper because the industrialists produce things not npc's i say nanite repair paste should have bpo's seeded. make it use trit+mex+nocx+gases and maybe even a spare, would be nice to have something else that requires gas to manufacture."
1/29/2010,"hey hey dominion upgraded the black ops portal to be able to bridge directly to a cyno beacon. this is awesomeso i head out to play and test. . .when i right click my capacitor to get the options to bridge or jump it gives me the ""jump to"" but it gives me a huge list of systems (all online beacons) and i can only physically jump to 9 ! its even worse when i try to ""bridge to"" as i get the same list of systems but aranged in 0....b > b....q > s....z > drop out lists :''( its the same when we use caps. is there any way to have this list to actually have functionality and only list beacons within range. before you say ""capital navigation window"" you cannot bridge using right click from the cap navigation window and only jump toso can we (if possible) have ""bridge to"" as an option in the cap nav window and arrays (within range) only in the right click context menu for capital ships/black ops. pretty please with sugar on top"
1/29/2010,this seems to make sense.
1/29/2010,agreed.
1/29/2010,"well i have an idea about rockets, to make them useful again.rockets should keep their low range but launcher cycle time should be very fast, but reload extremly slow.perhaps a penalty should be applied to the person firing rockets. i.e increased sig radius while firing them or velocity halved or tremendous capacitor need to fire.the idea is that you should be able to unload alot of damage over a short period of time."
1/29/2010,and this idea will insure that even if they fixed rockets no one would use them.not supported.
1/29/2010,rockets need fixing. but this is not the fix your are looking for.
1/29/2010,"1) low range, got that. because every weapon system has 2 options. blaster / rail, pulse / beam, rocket / light missile.but extending the reload time, on the smallest weapon system in the game? the reload time on missiles in general is already terrible. just how much longer would you want to take, to stick a cardboard tube in a hole?2) what other missile system has penalties to compensate for their sheer awesomeness?a) when's the last time you shot some bottle rockets off in the backyard for new years, and literally became ""larger than life""?b) i could see a velocity reduction... if your ship is lighter than 100kg. but i'm pretty sure we're all bigger than that.c) right... because all the other missile systems burn cap to fire too. what... they don't? that's why passive shield drake is the single most popular ship in the skies? oh...unless all these crappy ideas amount to rapid fire 2mil damage doomsday rockets, i don't think you'll find support anywhere around here."
1/29/2010,mind-numbingly unwieldy change to the dscanner.
1/29/2010,"the support system isn't a way to vote for if the idea is good or bad, it's a way of forcing the csm to bring it up with ccp if enough people support it."
1/29/2010,"don't support=reply say something about why you think the idea/proposal is wrong that is much better than cookie cutter 'i don't support this' which isn't useful for feedback or anything other than for some unknown reason, crazy, biased, etc you don't support the idea.^why i don't support this."
1/29/2010,if you don't think the csm should be wasting time with an issue you should be able to express that. the current system is like an election with only one name on the ballot.
1/29/2010,"this would be redundant. by default, no topic has any supports; which means every character with forum-posting ability is already ""not supporting"" it."
1/29/2010,"hard to see how many are ""for"" and how many are ""against"" in a 20 page threadnaught littered with circular debates."
1/29/2010,"not only that but if someone doesn't vote one way or another they may just not know enough about the issue to post, or even bother to read the original post."
1/29/2010,"i think the ratio of replies to supports is a sufficient indicator when it comes to threads with 10+ pages of debate. i trust the csms to navigate the thread and come to a reasonable position on whatever the proposal may be, rather than just defaulting to whatever a vote tally tells them to do. i'd rather consider them as rational minds as opposed to the puppet of for/against tally.this could be the case with someone supporting or ""not supporting""; not just someone who abstains from voting. i think the stronger arguments from either side of a heavily contested issue will far outweigh the effects of a non-voting non-contributor."
1/29/2010,"i'm not saying its impossible to get lp after the change. i am saying many people said this would lead to people leaving fw and low sec and, well, they were right. many major pvp corps are leaving. you see there will almost always be money to be made. because the fewer people doing missions the higher the worth of the lp. but now in order to farm efficiently you should join a pve centered corp because if you don't have a group of people to go with you on missions, its going to be tough. if you are in a big group that likes to do pve farming fleets you'll be fine. thats because when you have a big fleet of people who do allot of pve you can all ask for missions and turn them down when they are in bad systems and do the same sort of cherry picking this was supposed to prevent. however the people who joined fw mainly for the pvp and join a pvp corp, won't have lots of buddies to cherry pick missions with. they get hit hard. either do the carebear corp thing or like i said make eve your full time job, so that you can decline every 4 hours and/or play at odd hours when the systems are empty. so yeah if you are lucky enough to live in an off peak time zone or you can stay up till 4am you will love this change. because now its no longer a level playing field. those people, and those people, alone will be able to do the missions in systems that aren't crowded with pirates.and of course some factions are supposedly easier to do missions for than others. to the extent this is true it should be fixed."
1/29/2010,"like this guy says. ccp should just clean up the bloody awful mess they made with fw and fix the ""band-aid"" at that time.definitely not supported."
1/29/2010,"you don't think anyone can ever make 2-300 mill isk per hour in any other area of the game? well they can and in many different ways. but the thing is most people can't make that doing fw missions. they couldn't under the old rules and they cant now. some joker says ""yeah they make 500 bazillian"" and everone quotes him. the market adjusts. yes if you happen to get a good turn you can make allot in eve. not just fw missions. but the market adjusts. if its so easy to get fw lps then no one would make any money. it would be like tech 1 bps. the thing is, do you want people to make money in fw missions just because they can log in when few are online, or do you want an even playing field? that is what this proposal is really about."
1/29/2010,"i want them to fix fw including the ******ed ass mission system. which this proposal wont do on any level (meaning it wont fix fw missions even), they were broken before the ""re-fix"" and they are broken now. the op just wants it returned because he is whining about his cash cow being taken away. (i can still do them they are just annoying as hell now, if you cant manage the lvl fours do the level threes in an inty or something.) no, it really isn't about that at all."
1/29/2010,"i'm not sure what you want to fix in fw missions. i would agree tha,t if they are unbalanced based on faction - like minmatar can speed tank rats in an inty but amar and gallente can't - then this should be balanced. also if one side has more top agents that should be fixed. but you didn't indicate what you would want to fix and these issues are somewhat beside the point of this topic.as far as running level 3s in an inty - i can't fly inties and before i would train them to run level threes i would want to know *amarr* missions can be done in them. i couldn't finish some level 3 missions for amarr in a caracal so i'm dubious about trying it in an inty. the minmatar rats tend to hit you with allot of target painters. i'm wondering if you may just be able to do that because the rats are not balanced. what faction do you fly for? i give you reasons why allowing people to get missions in low traffic systems evens the playing field. you ignore those reasons and just say ""no it really isn't about that at all"" do you not agree that a substantial difficulty (if not *by far* the main difficulty) in completing fw missions is the risk of other players coming in to gank your pve ship? do you not agree that this means you are better off doing missions in systems that are not heavilly populated? do you not agree this gives an advantage to people who can log in at non- peak times? do you not agree that this advantage to those people is blunted if people who have to log in during peak times can at least cycle through missions until they can get one in a lower populated system? if you answered yes to all these questions you should be able to see that the old mechanic simply helped level the playing field for those who can only log on during the peak times. as far as ""whining"" about a ""cash cow"", i suppose that info on basic supply and demand didn't phase you one bit. people will make money at these missions the only question is how accessible they will be to your average mostly pvp minded fw pilot. they used to be accessible to people regardless of when they could log on. now after the change they aren't very accessible to those who log in during peak times. and surprise surprise people can no longer afford pvp in fw and leave fw in droves."
1/29/2010,"there are many proposals in this forum that focus on specific quality problems/issues. instead of addressing these issues individually. i think ccp needs to improve their whole qa function. qa is more than testing, it is about continuous improvement, learning from each mistake and ensuring that mistake is not repeated. ccp needs to hire an experienced software qa specialist with experience of continuous improvement. if ccp already have this person they need to further empower that person."
1/29/2010,confirming that i have 9 years of qa experience. they should just hire me

1/29/2010,"i'd say it's more analogous to seeing a ship's resistances. that's also something that you can definitely infer once you fire missiles at them (in fact, not just infer, but calculate directly), and which doesn't boost damage directly but pays a part in boosting that damage.velocity is a little different in that it's not an attribute of the ship, so much as an indication of the ship's current manoeuvres and how the tactical situation is changing. in that respect it's a bit like the distance column, it doesn't tell you anything about the other ship per se.having the sig radius up would allow you to know in advance which targets you could do full damage to dynamically, and thus removes a non-negligible part of combat tactics. currently one has to try to determine the most effective target to attack based on an assumption of their likely fittings and thus how easy it will be to damage them (compared to the threat they pose). having the actual sig radius visible would make it notably easier to determine the easiest targets to hit in advance, just like having a target's resistances shown (or worse, (e)hp).i'm not saying this is a bad idea per se, but it definitely changes the way target prioritisation works, dumbing it down slightly and removing the experience factor (as well as making it slightly harder for pilots to try something out of the box without that being identified until too late). there are certain attributes about the enemy ship that you can infer, but it's important that you go through the process of doing so.so - to my mind this makes pvp slightly less complex and rewarding, and doesn't make a difference in pve (on can look up actual sig radii anyway on websites like this if so inclined, and it's static per npc type)."

1/29/2010,well the following item has csm support but has not been progressed any further so feel free to add it to this meeting:increase forum signature file size limitations.
1/29/2010,tbh some of the issues last term didn't have a great deal of supports numbers wise but a lot proportion wise as some of these do and it's good that players are starting to pick up the slack and point out good suggestions that appear to have slipped through the net (something i've seen more of this time around on this forum).if you're getting told to do one due to spamming then name and shame.
1/30/2010,i want new posses as fast as possible
1/30/2010,"uhm lol, your comparing artilleries that are for long range to blasters that are a close range weapon system.uhm helloooooooo, wake up dude."
1/30/2010,"grut: the reason why i compared base stats is simple. if the base stats are balanced and the ships aren't, then the problem lies with the ships, not the weapons. if you want to put some turrets on your scorpion(or some other no-bonus ship with enough fitting/cap for anything you want), you should have to at least think about what you want to use. at present, i think that's the case. after the proposed buff, i don't think it would be. if you think the ships are too weak, change the ships - i'd be fine with a rokh getting another 50km of targeting to free up a mid, for example. i'm not fine with unbalancing the guns so that the ships can stay unbalanced and it'll all work out. and regarding the non-rokh snipers, the same sort of logic applies. nobody cares about them because they have too much range and not enough firepower. i mean, hooray, a harpy can hit out to 73km with railguns, but nobody actually cares about that. the eagle is short a damage bonus compared to other hacs, the ferox is short a damage bonus, a turret, or both(depending what you compare it to), the vulture is used for links instead of guns, the moa and merlin are mostly for new players, and the raptor is too slow for its role to my understanding. the ships are a problem, at least the eagle and ferox, but that doesn't mean you should be pinning the problems on the guns. bagehi: the number that stands out most there is just how well lasers track. an unbonused tachy tracks better than a bonused 425 - that seems wrong to me. also, how can you say gallente blow, when the minmatar numbers are worse across the board? a hyperion does the same dps as a maelstrom, tracks faster, and has noticeably longer range(it takes 1.6 falloffs to equalize, which is paint-scratching range). yeah, the mael is capless, it can switch damage somewhat(though it's not missiles, you're as likely to switch into an annoying damage type as out of it unless you carry 10 kinds of ammo), and its alpha is better, but it can't hit as far away or track as well, which are both fairly major drawbacks in their own right. i'm not trying to say that rails are perfect as-is, but a flat +15% damage is simply too much."
1/30/2010,"supported. railguns are bad and have been for as long as i've been able to use them. once i was in a harpy and a wt in eagle warped to my gate 150+km off, but since i knew medium rails are bad i flew towards him and forced him to warp away. now if you ask me i should have had to warp off. i'm pretty sure it wasn't a fail fit because i've gotten similar results from my eagle."
1/30/2010,"i must be missing something here.i was under the impression that galente was a rail gun and drone race. +the caldari was a projectile gun and missile race.that is why gal makes better use of the rails than a caldari would.might as well lose projectile and laser and make every race good at rails-sheesh.the boats themselves, especially the destroyers, need some tweaking, granted. train and use drones for ranges beyond the rails, do the same for missiles if you are caldari.very minimal missile training-(lvl 4 on launcher and standard missile) and (lvl 3 on support skills) with a decent fit for my cruiser and i hit and kill at 45km with standard missiles. more time training and that range and damage will only increase.personally, i prefer missiles over drones."
1/30/2010,"15% damage would make rails the ultimate long range weapon. that is stupid. however i do fail to understand why do tachyons have so much grater tracking speed. sure, they use more cap, but a 2x tracking difference? so, there are 2 ways to go about this: slight buff to the ships to make them balance out, more lock range, maybe powergrid, whatever is appropriate. reducing tachyon tracking somewhat to make rails and projectiles more competitive. i don't want to give rails simple damage buff, as that would break them. giving them slightly more tracking would be acceptable. giving them more range so although they don't have much damage and eat cap they outrange everyone, and outdamage at mid-ranges due to using showter range ammo? maybe. but as hershel pointed out problem is in somewhat underpowered ships. small buff to rails would be ok, about 5-7%, but not 15. this coming from a rail-user."
1/30/2010,"the caldari gunboats are in serious disadvantage against any other races' gunboats, because of their lack of damage bonus. yes, they make great snipers, but they are awful in pve. so i think this is a good idea.also, the moa's hull should be (in my opinion) redesigned from scratch. i don't know anyone who flies a moa, a few people use its t2 counterparts, but actually i haven't met anyone who liked it."
1/30/2010,"you are missing something-a lot of things, for that matter.gallente use drones and hybrid weapons with an emphasis on blasters and damage bonuses. caldari are a hybrid weapon (emphasis on railguns) and missile race, whose gunboats have bonuses to optimal range.actually, the main reason why gallente boats are often the preferred railgun users is that the gallente boats have a damage bonus that partially offsets the terrible dps of a railgun, while caldari are stuck with an optimal-range bonus that is often completely unnecessary for an already extremely long-range weapon.what were you trying to get across? was this part of your mistaken belief that caldari frequently use projectiles?messing with gallente and caldari gunboats also affects ships designed for blasters (whose underperformance also raises issues). i think it might help to reduce the number of turret slots on gallente boats by a slight margin so caldari boats without the damage bonus are more competitive, but that's a separate issue.the issue at hand is that railguns suck; the only thing they have going for them is extreme-range performance, and honestly not too many fights happen so far out that railguns outperform beams and artillery. they have terrible tracking, alpha, and dps next to the other long-range turrets, and to add insult to injury, use a fair amount of capacitor. we're not talking about 45km pve stuff. we're primarily talking about pvp, at sniper ranges going from 100-250km, depending on ship class and tactical scenario. plus, in pve, railguns have terribad dps and a minor range advantage just doesn't cut it. there's a reason the kronos is considered the worst of the marauders, and that's railguns.the classical sniping role is that of the large-fleet battleship sniper at 140 or 240km (140 is just under the 150km warp-to-wreck range, while targeting range is capped at 249km). in this kind of engagement, missiles are never used by the snipers, as by the time those missiles hit, the target's already dead or warped out. drones don't make the cut either--the 60km drone control range nonwithstanding, sentry drones just don't reach out that far and the flight time on heavy and scout drones would be abysmal.irrelevant, we're talking about turrets anyways. you were commenting on a topic you knew very little about.oh, and /supported."
1/30/2010,"my observation from this summary would be that the longest range ship is a railgun platform. after that, excluding the one non-railgun ship that has a bonus range, all of the railgun ships are still within optimal, while the others are all at optimal + 1/2 falloff. defining operational range as the range that still provides 80% or more base dps, railguns have a 10% longer operational range than all of the other turrets on unbonused ships, and comparing the ships that do have bonuses to range with each other, railguns have a 19% longer operational range.it would appear that the intended roll for railguns is range, not damage."
1/30/2010,"true. let me show you something though.to demonstrate, if we apply a 15% increase to rails damage modifier and a 10% pg increase to the eagle, we get the following:munnin (19.5k ehp):t2 720mm arties emp m (t1) = 309 dps @ 29+36 (2713 volley). tracking 0.04482t2 720mm arties carb. m (t1) = 209 dps @ 94+36 (1130 volley). tracking 0.04706eagle (19.5k ehp):t2 250mm rails am (t1) = 325 dps @ 47+20 (1138 volley). tracking 0.04967t2 250mm rails uranium (t1) = 270 dps @ 86+29 (948 volley). tracking 0.03148deimos (20k ehp):t2 250mm rails am (t1) = 360 dps (+158 drone dps) @ 23+37 (1345 volley). tracking 0.05101t2 250mm rails spike (t2) = 240 dps @ 84+37 (897 volley). tracking 0.01275zealot(21k ehp):t2 heavy beams multifreq (t1) = 448dps @ 23+10 (1110 volley). tracking 0.05362t2 heavy beams aurora (t2) = 299dps @ 81+10 (740 volley). tracking 0.01341i call that a better balance than the current state of affairs. what do you think?"
1/30/2010,except that snipe zealot can do this:t2 heavy beams aurora (t2) = 290dps@ 105+16 (720volley). tracking 0.01222 25k ehpand muninn:t2 720mm arties tremor (t2) = 232 dps @ 105+22 (1912 volley). tracking 0.00945 23k ehp +drones
1/30/2010,"the point of the eagle is that it can out range most battleships, not that it can compete with the other hac's for mid-range damage output."
1/30/2010,"you call 80km mid-range for sniperhacs? you obviously are:1) misinformed 2) troll 3) mentally challengedi bet you are just a faceless alt and you don't have the guts to post with your main, so i will pick option (2). of course it could be that you are a legitimate main that never undocks or has never flown a sniperhac. therefore, in that case your opinion is less than useful and can be disregarded. ki tech public recordsok, slightly different fit (or just using t2 ammo). how does that change the balance in favor of the eagle and the deimos? it makes both of the railboats look worse than the numbers i used (80km engagement range). so, i presume you support my proposal?"
1/30/2010,"improvements to navigation controls are always welcome, and these quick shortcuts are a excellent idea."
1/30/2010,"actually - i'd go even further and set some movement commands to more keys.i.e. the numpad:7 - 8 - 9 = orbit at 3 selectable ranges4 - 5 - 6 = keep at 3 selectable ranges1 - 2 - 3 = approach, stop, retreatnum_enter = fire group 1would give a bit more of the feeling to command something complex.ctrl+click is so usefull for targeting right now. but the thought is right - improve controls!"
1/30/2010,whaat? improving ui? who does that!
1/30/2010,"approved.more pvp, more kind of ammos used."
1/30/2010,5% kinetic bonus makes the ability to use all four damage types useless. in all fights these ships get -1 bonus unless fighting t2 minmatar.2 options:- use kinetic bonus and have it reduced by targets resists.- use best damage type and get no bonus.either way the bonus is useless. therefore change it please or simply remove it.
1/30/2010,"not supported at all.yes, the kinetic bonus on some of the caldari ships is only for 1 damage type, but how many advantages do you have over guns with 2 damage types with missiles though?.no tracking issues, you hit all the time, you do full damage at any ranges if the target isn't moving any fast and so on.so i don't see any problems at all why some caldari ships shouldn't have a kinetic damage bonus.edit: lol, this will be the same that my hound gets 15% bonus to torpedo explosive damage per level. i don't goes omg omg, can't i haz a rof bonus or damage bonus on my launchers instead?. no, it's because explosive it's the minmatar's damage.if you get the kinetic damage bonus removed from those caldari ships who have those bonuses, then i want my explosive torps damage bonus removed from my hound to, so every torps does the same damage as my explosive torps does on my hound now.or it means that every other races ships with racial damage bonuses also should be removed totally. so when you think about this. this will never happens.but then, what's the point on using a purifier over a hound if we take those racial damage bonuses away?. answer me that.so op, just stop whining. all races have some few ships that have racial damage bonuses. you just have to live with it. and if you don't like it, then wow is this way ->."
1/30/2010,can you at least concede that i defeated your earlier argument? or are you sweeping that under the rug? (i don't see the op getting changed)
1/30/2010,"it is you who are whining , all of your arguments are false.missiles hit alway what ? have you ever used them because they dont.no tracking issues? yeah if target using his mwd and forgets to move then missiles will hit max dmg, but so do the turrets.missiles nearly never do full dmg against the same class or smaller, turrets do most of the time.it is not about kinetic favour is bad ,but 5% kinetic dmg/lvl is way less than 5% dmg or 5% rof/lvl, also it takes away one of the missiles advantage chooseable dmg type.if it would be 10% kinetic dmg/lvl it would be fine and balanced.this change wouldnt change stealth bombers bonuses.if matar would only get explosive dmg bonus for their projectile guns that would be balanced."
1/30/2010,"lol, my arguments are false?.explain this to me then. if kinetic racial damage bonus gets removed from caldari ships, then for sure the amarr's, gallente's and minmatar's racial damage bonuses should be removed from every ship that have those racial damage bonuses to. that's for sure. do we agree on that?.your pretty stupid if you say that caldari can have it's racial damage bonus removed while the other races will continue to have it's racial damage bonuses. your a good damn awefull troll if you say that.and because of that, kinetic wont get removed from caldari ships ever as long the other races have racial damage bonuses, and that's why your arguments goes against what i'm saying. and it's in fact you who are whining. and it doesn't help what you have as an argument against what i said. because it's the fact what i'm saying.and because the other races will keep the racial bonuses, then caldari will have it's racial bonus.end of story."
1/30/2010,except for stealth bombers there is only one non caldari ship with a racial damage bonus and it is the gallente covert opps.
1/30/2010,"lets list those non caldari ships which have racial bonuses:-helios-stealth bombers-titans only for their doomsday-2 t1 frigs which are crappy as hell and nobody uses themall in all lets remove all racial dmg bonuses,and fix helios bonus too + that 2 t1 frigs lol."
1/30/2010,"lol yeah, keep dreaming buddy."
1/30/2010,"i wish there was a place similer to high sec for pirates, meaning only pirates could enter. if you have a sec status of -4.9 or higher, you get shot on sight."
1/30/2010,"like the ideas, except the low sec boarder idea. its hard enough running a trade operation."
1/30/2010,"it couldnt be like a single route channel from empire to empire anyway, but many crossing points, with back routes etc.it just doesnt make sense that these empires who are supposed to be enemies, are joined at the hip.. but, say minnie and gallente space could be joined, and caldari and amarr, as they are allies... just thoughts here anyway.many many good ideas... get more!"
1/30/2010,"lowsec needs a boost for sure, don't agrre on all your points but in general: i like it"
1/30/2010,i have taken this idea to the ideas and features forum:outlaw
1/30/2010,"we really need outlaw expansion.also several game mechanics related to less legal activity and low sec needs real working. meaning not only some random boost this and that but something real. i think most of people consider low sec as the ""real"" outlaw space because it's where ""flashy"" people are. i think this should be the viewpoint when making up some new stuff. problem with recent ""low sec oomphs"" is that they were really not helping the outlaw kind of activity much.i don't really know how you could point out one single thing which needs working on because there's so much. but generally being an outlaw trying to catch miners/haulers does not really work that well. as in risking 300mil ship to kill 500k hauler which might drop you nothing except warp stabs then hear him complaining about how easy it's to shoot a hauler. that's after you've been waiting hours to see anyone."
1/30/2010,"supported, however, i think that more than anything, the session change reset is the biggest issue here. however, how can that be tackled easily? i'm not sure it can."
1/30/2010,"you know, you can exploit what you suggest by micromanagement. if you get free hp you just need join and leave fleet repeatedly, this will cost ccp to make whole now way to count bonuses in order to prevent this, i really don't think they are going to do this just for you"
1/30/2010,"hi, so i noticed today that when i docked up and went to activate my orca i misclicked and hit trash it. now luckely there is always the do you wish to actually do this thing but still i just think there are a few places where the button places could be better such as the self destruct and input pos password button. o and nidia reminds me that you cannot remove destination in any way other than going to the map to clear destination. might i suggest having your destination system being a clickable button with the option for info and removing the destination on your autopilot overview thing."
1/30/2010,seems reasonable to me.
1/30/2010,"sounds reasonable.suggestion: when you right-click an object, and the pop-up menu appears, make the ""trash"" option activate a sub-menu on the side, (show a right triangle there for sub-menu available), and have a choice of ""confirm trash"" there. then you have to click twice to really trash something, but, you don't have to wait for a pop up window, and you don't remove your focus from the original menu. click trash by mistake, the menu is still there, and you can select your real choice.yeah, also agree on the map lovin. might i also suggest an option to remove a waypoint, remove the destination (making the last waypoint, if any, the destination), or remove route completely? maybe an option on the left side buttons while docked?"
1/30/2010,"it is ui that makes a difference between a god game and an interesting but unplayable game. current suggestion makes sense, and is a good ui tweak."
1/30/2010,sounds good to me.
1/30/2010,"a way to add negative medals, thief, spy, scammer."
1/30/2010,"i, xialis, being for the same corp and alliance as the op, support this proposal.we all want more pvp, but if high clone costs are keeping people from saying 'what the heck i'll go join that fleet' for fear of losing a 30mil+ clone because they don't see 30mil of benefit from the fight. effectively lowering the number of people pvping in a pvp game.high sp chars in low ability ships don't have much advantage over low sp chars in the same ships, so why should they be force to grind up much more isk to fight in those same ships? this grind also keeps people from fighting as they are too busy grinding up some isk. yes, you can make heaps of money in 0.0 but you have to actually be doing that, making money, not pvping."
1/30/2010,thanks for the support and mostly friendly discussion.i think destination skillqueue and xialis explained the cost/performance better than i did. why be wasting more time making money for your clone when the benefits are so low. also i understand my proposed graph wasn't friendly to younger players and i wasn't happy with it. i have now revised my numbers a bit and made a beter looking graph that makes the higher end higher and cheaper for the younger players. my costs are based around that the first clone is at 1m skill points and should be fairly cheap.new proposed costsplease visit your user settings to re-enable images.
1/30/2010,"strongly supported.players are already risking implants and their ship, it doesn't make much sense for older players to be penalized just because they have more sp."
1/30/2010,"isn't that the idea?if you are flying a class of ship way lower than your sp would normally dictate or you are highly diversified across a wide spread of things then you should indeed have a steep financial drawback for flying around in smaller things meant for lower sp players. yeah you can make that choice just like everyone else... except if you do make that choice you are taking up a slot a younger player could be using so why not pay a cost for that right. elsewise go start an alt or let someone with less sp in your roam spot.this game does not need anything added to help out older higher sp characters financially.they already run the show. let new guys gain some footholds here or you will end up with an indestructible glass ceiling.re-balance the sink?if the sink is still there why even bother?it's alot of busy work to make the game cater to your personal play patterns and style more.this is not a ""pleases many"" idea.... so far it's mostly just a ""pleases this corp/alliance idea"".knock it down."
1/30/2010,"i'm am in full support of this, granted i am a fellow corpie of the op but if you really have a look at the proposed changes they make sence.it is no wonder when people start getting up higher in sp they ditch 0.0 because it is too easy to lose your pod, and that cost of replacing starts to hit you hard.anyway to all you haters out there, stop and look at it from a 50mil+ sp pvp characters pov."
1/30/2010,that. although i would support removal of exponential cost increase and replacing it with a straight line. i don't honestly see anything positive in a close costing over 30 mill.
1/30/2010,"taking up a slot?this is a horribly flawed argument that a few have used and not just in this thread. the main determining in isk making ability in eve is time. time to grind out the missions, time to maintain your pos network, time to run exploration sites, time to sit and mine, time to trade (with trading probably being the least time intensive of those). unless you own a t2 bpo, in which case you can make the money with less time investment.i can guarantee there are players 1/4 my age with more money than i have or have ever spent in the game."
1/30/2010,"if it was up to me to decide, i would remove the whole clone thing all together. maybe a small symbolical fee."
1/30/2010,"currently all of the force recon ships (except the falcon) get range bonuses, while the pilgrim does not. if you aren't familiar with recon ships, the force variant shares 1 bonus (aside from the hull bonus) with the combat, receives a covops cloak and cyno bonus's. the rapier and arazu get range bonus's instead of the damage bonus's. the falcon gets a strength bonus because the rook doesn't receive a range bonus (because it doesn't need one). the pilgrim on the other hand, gets an amount bonus, which would be similar to the damage bonus the the other force and combat recon ships get, instead of the range bonus, which seems to also break the common theme of the other recon's receiving the first recon ship bonus stated in the description. i feel as if the pilgrim should receive the range bonus instead of the amount bonus for usage reason to.scenarios i've run into turn out with me not getting a kill. i warp in cloaked to an asteroid belt where a see some guy mining (why people mine solo in low sec is beyond me). i would warp in to far from him to use my medium neuts or use a disruptor, now i could slow boat cloaked to get closer to him, but i would often more than not land next to something uncloaking me, giving that person enough time to get away. not to mention it takes time for drones to get close enough to do damage and if they have an active tank, i can't use my neuts to stop that tank.you might say ""fly in a fleet with some friends"", if was going to fly in a fleet, i would bring my curse."
1/30/2010,"i fail to see how increasing the range of your neuts will stop a low sec miner from warping away before you get a point on him. once you get a point on him, does the few seconds needed to get from tackle range to neut range really give him any chance for survival?"
1/30/2010,"i would have thought that a transfer amount bonus would be the equivilent to the falcon ecm strength bonus.also, a range bonus to vamps/neuts wouldnt help you solo, cause you wouldnt be able to get point on them. and tbh, if you're bumping into stuff in a belt as you slow boat towards a miner... wow, i cant even think of words to express how utterly impossible that should be.not supported"

1/30/2010,the pilgrim is a very good little solo boat and is in my mind the epitome of a stealthy solo hunting vessel.saying that it is the only one of the force recons which is unable to use both it's ewar varients outside of web and scram range making them all but useless in long range cloaky recon death gangs.it's a toss up really and i'm undecided.

1/30/2010,"it's not what i think should happen. it's what needs to happen. it would put it in line with the other ore-items. ice harvester ii's bring in 2,000m3 per harvester, ok, so make it the same as the ice harvester ii, but with the increase to disntance, instead of only 2km, make it 5km, so it would be 15km out to harvest. here, let me explain a bit more. modulated strip miner ii - 10km 360m3; ore-strip miner - 15km 530m3. ice harvester ii - 10km 2,000m3; ore-ice harvester - 12km 1,000m3. hmmmm not worth it. at least the ore-strip miner gives the increase to mining amount and no use of crystals, so no more wasting isk on crystals, but the ore-ice harvester only gives you a 2km distance bonus???? it needs to be 2,000m3 and 5km instead of only 2km to make it inline with the other harvesters and ore-items."
1/30/2010,"lord helghast - i am not trying to down-grade the ore-items, they are meta 6 and t2 are meta 5, they should be better, not worse. and the changes would be an increase not a decrease. by doing so, it would not only fit it in with the other ore-items but actually make it worth buying then."
1/30/2010,"i guess i just don't understand the need for a distance modification. you don't move when you mine ice. what does it matter if you're 10km, 12km or 15km from an ice cube. you're propulsion is at 0 m/s. i understand you want to ""bring it inline"" with the rest, but shouldn't there be a need to do that, not ""just because""?i'd go along with a cycle time decrease. but not a m3 increase.*edit* actually, i had to double check. ice harvester ii's do not bring in 2,000 m3. only 1,000 m3. the difference between the tech i and the tech ii's is the cycle times; 600 seconds down to 500 seconds. they both operate at 10km optimal range too. no difference. so, a cycle time adjustment, and nothing else, would be ""in line"" with other t1/t2 items."
1/30/2010,"then again, it got me thinking again. if you only increase the harvesting amount to 2,000m3 you're actually still not increasing anything, while the ore-strip miner is still giving a mining amount bonus vs the t2 module, so either a decrease in cycle time is needed or an increase in harvesting amount is needed to still put it inline with the ore-strip miner's bonuses. either way, an increase in amount harvested or a decrease in cycle time is needed. my suggestion is to decrease cycle time. max is 205.01s right now, so maybe 180s would be in line, do to the large increase for the ore-strip miner amount vs the modulated strip miner ii's. it's an increase of 170m3 per cycle for the ore-strip miners vs the modulated strip miner ii's so a decrease in cycle time from 205.01s to 180s is only a decrease of 70s. i mean that number can be arranged by ccp, but it was just a number i pulled off the top of my head for now."
1/30/2010,"cyrus, you got me checking numbers too and you're right about the amount, they are also only 1,000m3. but in order to bring the ore-ice harvester inline with the other ore-items, a decrease in cycle time would be needed and an increase to the distance to 5km instead of only the 2km. the only reason i am brining up the distance part is because the other ore-items have that bonus, so in order to put it inline with the other ore-items, that would have to be updated as well."
1/30/2010,"you know, you can buy this ore stuff only in two stations in outer ring someone going to have huge profit if this happens.but yes ore stuff sux."
1/30/2010,"in an effort to reward active industrial players and haulers, and provide a moderate level of protection that would balance game play versus gankers and attacks, and make escorts more valuable, i propose a new module that functions as a super damage control module, titled the ""armadillo"" module.the armadillo module would have a 99.9% cpu bonus for industrial ships requiring level 4 industrial skills (mammoth, inty iv, inty v), all transport class ships, mining barges and exhumers to limit their use to industrial ships.the module would function as follows. upon activation it would drain the capacitor to provide 99% omni resistance for all shields, armor and structure. this ""shell"" would last for 30 seconds. during the time the module is active the ship is rendered totally immobile (basically balled up in the shell). upon emerging from the ""shell"" the ship's capacitor would be ""damaged"" so that it is maxed out at 5% level (or as much as would be needed to jump only 1au) for a period of 5 minutes. this would prevent multiple uses within the 5 minute period.what this module would accomplish is to at least give indy ships a chance at some defenses. it does not make the ships better so passive players do not receive any benefit. by using a low slot industrialist must choose to sacrifice yield or cargo to use the module. by providing only a small window of protection it will not drastically effect the solo miners and haulers in low and null sec. what it will do is provide a small level of protection in high sec for the cavalry to arrive, be it friendlies or concord. but the biggest thing it will do is make combat escorts way more valuable. if the paper mache ships knew they could protect themselves for 30 seconds that would give time for combat escorts in fleet to actually have a chance to prevent their destruction versus only being able to avenge it. also, it would require suicide gankers to fly ships capable of tanking concord for short durations, or use larger fleets, effectively increasing the size and cost of ships they would need.tl,drnew armadillo module, or super damage controlrequires low slot and limited to certain industrial ships30 seconds of 99% omni resistances5 minute ""cooldown"" with wrecked capacitor to prevent repeated usebrings combat escorts into play, and only rewards active players"

1/30/2010,"believe it or not, you can go work for the mining corps in eve and they give you the suckiest of mining missions where there are virtually no rats of any value and ores which can't be bought or sold to anywhere else.there's not even a random massive sellable asteroid (the equivalent to a faction drop) in any of the missions.they are a waste of oxygen.remove this rubbish from eve or make it fun, either is a positive outcome."
1/30/2010,"yes, please.i love to mine but i decline all these pointless, worthless missions because nearly anything else i can do in eve short of afk mining in low-sec is more entertaining and profitable."

1/30/2010,"i have seen aot of those missions, lvl 3 and 4s, they involve going to an asteroid, giving it half a cycle and coming back and getting you reward of few thousand isk. saying they need improvment is like not saying anything. they need alot of improvements. few ideas:they provide minerals normally not found in high-secthey make you mine an aasteroid guarded by rogue drones, meaning you need to first kill rats, then mine some rly rair minerals (really an imaginary mineral that cannot be sold on the market) and then bringing it to the agent for some good pay (pay has to be good as mining in this case does not make any money, and the rogue drones don't drop much).notice that main point is mining, not strong rats: i.e. drones must be easy to kill for non-combat character, not like current lvl 4's, but easier."
1/30/2010,"teadaze whole argue can be summarized into ,i paid good money for my garage alt and you aren't going to make me look like a tool by making it obselete.absolutely supported. of all the idiotic uses of pos bowling and all the crap unpreventable theft there is just no sane reason to ever leave it in a pos ever. i can't even believe this guy can sit there and say not being able to leave the ship ever is a required handicap to its combat ability."
1/30/2010,"ok - i ought to really give you some credit back. forums posts are tricky enough to make decisions from, but you are clearly showing that you take your position seriously.i don't know what the answer to this is - you are damned if you post in a discussion, or you will be called apathetic if you do not.you are quite right to point out that this thread has not attracted that much support, that is because it has degenerated into a mudslinging thread .i'll stick to my view - somebody should really start a proper thread on super-capital anchoring (a proposal) rather than ""make it easier to play with"" (a whine). then we'll see who supports it and who doesn't."
1/30/2010,"if you are going to summarize my position please do so accurately instead of trying to put words into my mouth.as i have stated previously i don't have and never have had a supercapital. i have a carrier pilot who like most carrier pilots could fly a supercarrier (it doesn't require anything special, just needs racial carrier level 3 - not even 4 or 5 required!).so at this point one group of people say i shouldn't be commenting on this because i don't have one already and another group complain i couldn't possibly be arguing against it unless i have...put that to one side, why don't i have a supercarrier? simple. i don't want to have that pilot stuck inside the ship because i use him for other things. this along with the cost vs usage i would get means i decide not to buy a supercarrier. the restrictions are working as intended for me (and i'm sure many other people).lets look at supercarrier ownership* needs a carrier pilot with racial carrier 3 (lots of those in game)* needs 15-20 billion isk (significant but totally achievable for many of those carrier pilots)* requires the pilot to sit in the ship at all times or leave it unattended at a friendly pos (this is one thing that puts me and op off)now, if i was in an alliance throwing capitals around everyday then that third restriction wouldn't stop me owning one because i would have a reason to use it everyday. agony don't throw caps around everyday so for me another negative is how little use it would get meaning it would need to be parked most of the time.now, in the op's world where you can park your supercarrier in a pos and have it sit there 100% safe without any further interaction that third restriction vanishes. now any casual player with a carrier pilot and some isk can own a supercarrier. that is something i feel would be terrible for the game. some people sidestep the issue with either garage alts, or more commonly in my experience have a second combat pilot. is it cheating? op thinks so and i respect his position. i won't use a garage alt either because i have enough alts already thanks and don't want another one . many people do but it is their choice and not a requirement.i simply don't agree that ccp are forcing people to have an alt, which was the crux of the op's argument for changing the rules. firstly i was under the impression that pos bowling was patched out over a year ago and anything left in the pos shield isn't safe no matter what value it has. i don't see why supercapitals should be safe at a pos when other ships are not.secondly you can argue that point all you like but it is one of the restrictions that ccp decided was appropriate. i'm simply saying i don't see a compelling reason to make supercapitals easier to own. i am however just one of nine on the csm and i don't speak for the rest of them. it is entirely possible such a proposal would pass without my vote.rather than trying to attack me or misrepresent my position why not support the proposal the op raised and encourage other people to as well. if enough support is achieved then it will end up in front of the csm. i won't support it but there are 7-8 others who might..."
1/30/2010,"it is not like there were no ideas on the table : quit that focus on issue submissions, which never get implemented. do not stop the assembly hall and associated procedure; but stop doing only that. the csm should be used as a player think tank, where ccp inputs topic that they are actually working on. this is what csm3 had prominently discussed with ccp, and zastrow wrote an emotional pledge in the csm3's dev blog.having the csm discuss issues, which are on ccp's agenda will increase the impact, which the csm can do on actual development. instead of bombarding ccp with player submitted issues, that are totally off limits and out of focus of current development.ccp does not neglect the players, nor the csm. it is simply that the topics brought up by the csm are - more often than not - too far away from ccp's legitimate autonomy in the game's development. having ccp input open questions into the csm will bring the csm closer to actual development; in turn, the csm's anwers will have a higher chance of making a difference.i admit, such a scheme may entail keeping more topics under nda, and the regular csm meeting minutes may have to undergo review by ccp before publishing.let's see this diagramme; ccp's current development focus and csm's player submitted issues - in average - have a certain distance :ccp's current development(ccp) <---------------------> (csm) csm's new ideasthis distance needs to be briged in order to make a difference on ccp's development. else, csm's input will simply go to the backlog. and priority changes in the backlog are hard to display to the general public. xhagen affirms over and over again that such changes do happen. but rediscussing present issues does require a lot of patience by the player public and there is simply no process yet to ""rediscuss"" items, once submitted by the csm, when they go into development.now, the sum of all the csm's procedures does result in a certain influencial force on ccp. these procedures are :- the item submissions (and re-submissions and re-re-submissions) on the assembly hall, which are submitted to ccp via meetings- the faith of ccp into the csm, which is constantly growing- live discussion with ccp in online meetings and on iceland (iceland has the biggest impact)the strength of csm's influence, as a sum of the above, can be visualized like this :(f) ----->ccp has a will to change it's mind and include ideas and aspects (i call them ideas and aspects rather than new issues), brought up by the csm. it can be visualized like this :(w) --->if you now overlap the distance between ccp's and the csm's focus with the force of csm's push and ccp's will to change, you get this :(ccp) <---------------------> (csm) (w) ---> <----- (f)you clearly see the gap, which remains. whining will not close that gap !instead of only relying on csm's new ideas, brought up by players on the assembly hall, we will now look at the current development plan of ccp and pick items from that queue, which are under scrutiny. we will call them (sbi), as in ""sprint backlog item"". those of you, who have followed ccp's demonstration of their development method, which is scrum, have heard of that sub-process defined by the method. sprint backlog items are still not implemented, and may fail, but they are considerably closer to reality, because they are features chosen from the huge product backlog that shall be implemented :(ccp) <-------> (sbi)go ahead and overlay csm's strength with that distance and you see :(ccp) <-------> (sbi) (w) ---> <----- (f)they meet !as a clear result : ccp must give the csm items from their current sprint backlogs for discussion."
1/30/2010,"edited for grammarif you go further on that will-and-force idea, you will have to consider two modfications to the last diagramme for the following reasons :- csm's force will be smaller when discussing sprint backlog items, because some of them may not be allowed for public discussion on the assembly hall, nor a public display at all (via minutes). that reduces the range of the force (f).- ccp's will, on the other hand, to listen to the csm may be bigger for items, which they are working on already. they want the development to be ... awesome. hence, player feedback - moreover : feedback from the most dedicated players the game has ever seen - will let this will (w) grow.a reduced force :(f) --->and an increased will :(w) ---->overlayed with the distance of sprint backlog items from reality :(ccp) <-------> (sbi) (w) ----> <--- (f)still meet !"
1/30/2010,you want to give people who are part of the player base access to the sprint backlogs? absolutely not! do you really want a few select people to know how production requirements on certain items will change in the future (say)?
1/30/2010,"no kidding. wasn't one larkonisgate enough for you?until there are actual penalties for the misuse of this information and the violation of the nda (and i'm thinking actual civil penalties here, not the crap temp bans that were handed down the first time), the csm should be kept as far away from upcoming change implementation as possible.you mention above the communication is only one way - shocker that, right? since the csm has demonstrated it's inability to use the information they do get in a responsible manner, why the hell should ccp give them more?"
1/30/2010,"your assuming that i'm throwing a fit over the communications pipeline between ccp and csm.i'm not.i have a problem with a-holes who get off scott free breaking nda's... and csm people who push there own private agendas by totally ignoring the people.you assumption that csm people automatically ""give a ####"" about us is false.of course not all csm are like that... but i'm getting tired of a total and complete lack of accountability for there purpose here.there needs to be a change that proves to use that the csm are unbiased... willing to work for the community... who gives a fly crap what ""there"" alliances want or what the csm cannidate in question wants... they serve us..... like it or not... thats there job.this isn't a instant fanfest contest trip to iceland... that's just for grins...yet some csm members have been quoted saying such things repeatedly.these little things are what turns people off about the csm... and cause the ever rising population of people who either don't care... or would rather see it shut down.damn straight i'm bitter... i love this game... enough to growl a bit louder."
1/30/2010,"it seems the penalty for breaking nda isn't in line with the seriousness but that is up to ccp to fix. there is also a lack of accountability for not turning up to meetings which again ccp need to look at.on the subject of ""private agendas"", part of the problem there is the laughably high level of support required for a proposal to be put in front of the csm ""without"" a csm rep picking it up in the first place. csm reps will naturally pick up topics they agree with or have experience of because there are limited spots for each meeting.i can't comment for other reps, but i actually attempt to interact with the rest of the playerbase, doesn't seem to be working out so well for me so far i'm not quite sure what measure of accountability you want.* csm reps not turning up to meetings without good reasons - that needs ccp to get tougher with.* csm reps breaking nda - that is also up to ccp to deal with because the nda contract is between them and the rep.* csm reps disagreeing with proposals or which never reach the required level of support - what exactly do you suggest here?part of the issue is the csm can't do much to an individual rep and it is down to ccp to deal with them.there is a fundamental flaw in your argument here.1) you assume that anyone from an alliance is only voting for their alliance interests which are not for the common good.2) you assume that anyone not in an alliance will only vote for the common good.3) you assume that anyone in eve can be unbiased towards their in game playstyle or experiences.how do you propose to stop bias? the current system seems to create a council of representatives from a number of different playstyles but that comes down to the public vote and can't currently be controlled by ccp.lets assume you have two people in noob corps. one person supports suicide ganking, the other doesn't. a proposal is raised to outlaw it, one supports the other doesn't. is that bias bad? are csm supposed to pass any proposal raised without discussion of the possible outcomes? at that point all that happens is a counter proposal is raised and that is passed as well. now you have two proposals, one to outlaw suicide ganking and one to support it. ccp then ignore the whole subject and nobody gains anything. it becomes a huge waste of time.the point of the csm is to filter the player requests and pass the most important to ccp (who are then free to ignore them if they so choose). there is an element of personal opinion on the decisions but that is fine because the council represent multiple playstyles.i keep forgetting about fanfest afaik no current csm reps have said they only ran for a free trip to iceland but i agree that there was some epic level trolling in the past which has put some players off the whole csm concept.i am attempting to show there are still people who do take the responsibility more seriously."
1/30/2010,"i'm going to assume for the sake of this discussion/argument that your completely unaware of the history behind my statements... if that is the case... then i'm a little disapointed in your supposed proclaimed experinced in the many areas of eve online.one of the things i tend to ""assume"" (yes that might be a mistake) is you are aware of what the csm is historically... and its actions to be sure.1: the nda - your correct... but it's not seems... it is. that is something you need to bring up. there is an overwhelming opinion that lark should have been permanently banned. the fact he wasn't... sets a precedent that implies that the csm tend to think they are above the law so to speak... and can get away unscathed minus whatever punishment ccp employs (point and case... lark)now i have nothing against lark other than the fact he's just the type of personality i don't get along with... i respect his skills... i respect his driving force being that he is a pirate and eve requires a balance of all aspects to be great as it is. what i don't respect is the bravado he reflects and the fanboi club that continue to downplay it like it was nothing major and he was just keeping in line with piracy. real life is not eve online... to mix them and use it as an excuse is poor. yes he fessed up... yes he apologized... but that's not enough... never will be... and personally i get the sneaking suspicion he will be back in the csm... in some form or fashion... and that really ****es me off. otherwise i wouldn't think much of it and let it go aside from making damn sure history records correctly.but am i ccp? no... but i take nda's/contract's seriously in my line of work... you don't #### around with that... and he should have been taught that a little more harhsly imho. we have to live with it... why the hell can't he?overall this makes the csm look horrid.... and as such invokes a lack of confidence due to the lack of action in taking steps to prevent such repeats. such as encouraging ccp to be a little more harsh in its punishment. if anything it makes the csm look like its responding appropriate. instead of just standing around and saying things.2: your assuming i'm in line with the crowd on this area... i'm not.if you knew your history you'd see that there have been occasions where the csm chose/ignored valid proposals and or decisions... that or completely dropped the ball on communication with the people.such examples are frequent and legitimate requests for meeting minutes... excused by silence or ""oh we can't talk about that"". i realize some things can be mentioned but telling me if my proposed skill queue alternation passed would harldy be considered an earth shattering feat that would break the game as we know it due to its hush hush secrecy. i'm sure i speak for everyone who have had proposals passed up that didn't get feedback until months later if at all.proposals brought by csm... passed by csm... voted down by the people. this is outrageous and disgusting. that was one of the most insulting actions of the csm to-date. your job is to listen... to weigh-in and to bring forth proposals that are legitimately supported. ignoring proposals that are passed up with very minimal support is stupid and begging to get your heads blown off in a political fashion. it only takes 1 singular incident to do that... and it happened. now we have zero confidence in what the csm really is... and just how legitimate your motives are.yes... your not the representative responsible... i get that... but you have a voice... and you can say/do something about it.the representatives at the time said nothing and didn't bother to point it out.. they just voted it up and that was the final nail in the coffin. (and that was published in the minutes to boot)<more to come>"
1/30/2010,"<continued>there are proposals that are foolish and ridiculous mob mentalities... and while i'm happy to see they are ignored... this is also an inherently dangerous problem. you can't be a democractic platform and ignore your people.no matter how foolish or stupid they are (i can protest all i want but i am one voice).if they support en-masse then you are bound to pass it up and vote on it.... vote it down... it's legit and honestly people need to see that to get it through there thick skulls its not going to happen... such as ghost training.saying ""it was proposed and passed up"" is stupid. you should link history instead.showing a record with minutes to make the point clear ccp said no.people are not going to search for the proof in the pudding if you don't bother to give them a damn bowel to put it in.3: the flaw in my argument over bias is not mine... the flaw lies in human nature. it's a veiled statement.i mean lets be serious... the usa's government has politicians who claim to be for the people but everyone knows they have there own bias and agenda. you can never achieve true bias.but you can sure as hell make it hard on them to do anything outright. the bulk of the population in csm are elected by alliances of a large population... that or those who have large swaths of gangs who happen to agree on one point (take care party! *yuck!*).i realize this is a game... but the csm should treat this seriously... and with a driving force to be determined to make it better one way or another.so when i ask for a csm that is unbiased and that gives a damn... i'm talking about people who actaully participate frequently.... who post frequently.... here... people who are willing to talk... people who keep balance and a nuetural position instead of taking sides when its a little to obvious they have there own firm opinion.example you used: one supports suicide ganking... the other doesn't.when someone proposes to remove insurance for getting concord'd... there is a major difference in coming up with some ****amania excuse (such as economics and no csm hasn't said that... yet) and someone who takes the time to explain the mechanics and weighs things out statisticly.worse yet... saying ""deal with it... high sec is supposed to be safe... not safer"" is a poor response.thats our job... even mine even... to troll... and be stupid.your job is to be a mediator and to weigh things out.your debate with the supercaps... you don't fly one... people know that... yet you passionately argue.why? your no expert... you only know what you hear... see... understand. you stand to lose more respect than i would by arguing your out of your bloody mind.but we both know its just an opinion... but your more public than i am.. people will shoot you first before they shoot me as i'm just a noob.your ""csm"".if you took the time to talk to the super cap pilots and ask them how they felt about this... you would likely change your opinion a little bit... if not have an understanding and respect the fact they suffer.instead your focusing on ccp's supposed stance or your fear of proliferation of super caps sprouting up like rabbits.or maybe your side of the coin is entirely different... fact is... most csm doesn't go that far.at least your civil enough to discuss to a point... that i'll give you...4: as to the fanfest... funny how you said ""current"". of course there wouldn't be... that's the next csm (not to mention previous)... i suggest you take the time to think about that before responding.bottom line is this... you have a serious problem here... and it's not what you initially thought it was.solution? starts with you... and it's not an easy one due to the holes dug in due to previous actions.no its not likely your fault... but its a mess you have to clean up."
1/30/2010,"yes it is. this is wow.as for the rest of your post, i don't think you know what it would be like, but if you don't want to go in the arena you wouldn't have to.until your last sentence i thought you were describing eve in general. so this will be like everything else in eve. whats wrong with that? but really, you are wrong in your predictions."

1/30/2010,"are the contracts that ccp employees and the csm sign in this regard public? id be curious what the actual clause said. are ccp employees bound by terms at least as strong as those they hold csm to?yeah they can prove he bought such and such items. but how can they prove what his motivation was? i doubt larconis really had any legal analysis of his position. i think he didnt think his actions were justified under his contract, didnt want to lie about it, so he did the right thing. (of course purposely violating an agreement is not the right thing but *after* he did that and he was questioned about it he seemed to have done the right thing.) also my questions are still unanswered. would you say from my hypothetical the person would have to buy all the warp core stabilizers or be in breach of contract?"

1/30/2010,"iceland may well have different laws but contracts such as this in the us, the uk and canada (which are the kind i've seen/signed) are not public. they are a private binding agreement between parties. the person agreeing signs it and both sides keep a copy.the reason for the privacy is that sometimes the terms themselves may contain references to trade secrets etc.btw - contracts of this sort aren't always very nice. there's a big debate over a woman who was sexually assaulted by fellow employees in iraq and, because of her contract, cannot sue or even file a legal complaint. needless to say, it's being fought in court as to whether that is a legal agreement.motivation isn't relevant (legally) here, just the fact that the info was publicly revealed. if you're given a document under nda and accidentally leave it on a table in a mall you're still guilty of violation even if you didn't mean to. also, in civil court (at least in the common law system - i think iceland uses a different one but not certain) the standard of proof is different from criminal cases. only 51% at fault in a common law system needs to be proven in civil or contract law.the fact that a change to item x was in the meeting minutes and then a csm went out and bought/sold item x in large quantity would almost certainly be more than sufficient for most juries. out of such questions are lawyer's fortunes made. in iceland? i don't know. in north america, you'd just have to convince a jury that there was more than 51% blame/intent (which i think most decent lawyers probably could do, but even lawyers can stuff up a case).remember that few nda violations ever see a courtroom either. usually it's just a nice legal way to turf the person very hard.as to ccp's employees, again, i don't know iceland's laws. in north america sometimes contracts are signed and sometimes they aren't and what's on them can be anything from very mellow to ridiculous (see the assault case above for instance). most benefit the employers far more than the employees unless the employee has a highly unusual amount of bargaining power.ccp might not even have contracts for their employees (my company doesn't for many of their salaried people) and just rely on icelandic labour laws and who knows what they are?"

1/30/2010,"stated from the ccp reimbursement page-'losses caused due to disconnection as a direct result of a server node drop or an unannounced server downtime may be reimbursed pending investigation by, and at the discretion of, a gm. ships lost due to lag or non-server related disconnection will not be reimbursed.'lag, i'd like a definition of what ccp refer to as 'lag'.a small time delay in your actions ?, sure, i guess thats more than acceptable in alot of situations. even a more lenghy time delay, say upto a minute, yes i guess that would be conciderd more of a severe lag, but i mean as long as you still have a little bit of time to send an action and wait for it to receive / activate (turn on a modual, mwd, repper, hardner etc) or even attemp to guide your ship in a general direction such as a stargate, either towards or away from, or even try to 'warp out'. i do agree as long as you have options such as these, regardless if their is a small or large time delay you still have a relivate control over your vessel / pod thus having the options to make a decision to defend yourself or try to escape death, this i do belive does not deserve reimbursement.altho, when you are caught up in something more extreme, as in you try to enter a grid / system and nothing happens for 30+ minutes, and i mean nothing, you cannot see celestial objects such as planets or moons, brackets that resemble something (such as an asteroid belts, star gates) or anything that you would normally see, and i do mean see nothing, overview showed the words 'nothing found' you cannot see your friends or your foes, or even your own ship for that matter. i'm talking about a completely blank screen for more than 30+ minutes and in alot of cases even more than that. it is ludicrous to think that ccp can lable this kind of problem as a form 'lag'.now, when you experince this you may aswell concider yourself already dead. with no options, dead, you cannot do anything to try to defend yourself in any way. as i stated in the first paragraph, if you can do these things (as in having even the slightest control) i do belive thats a case of lag and no reimbursement should be given, altho if you experince what i describe in paragraph 2, i would call it a bug or failure rather than what ccp refer to it as a 'lag'. then in this case i do belive you should be intitled to a reimbursement.if you 'petition' your loss under these conditions ccp will most likeley reply with the message-'it is impossible for us to measure how much lag each person has and even harder to verify which losses were the result of lag and which losses were legitimate. reimbursing losses from large battles due to possible lag which is unverifiable from our end, would in essence mean removing the risk of loss from fleet battles entirely and thereby nullify their whole purpose. i am sorry that we cannot assist you and i hope you understand our stance on this matter.'and i can completely understand that, but this bit 'which is unverifiable from our end' i do disagree with this. as far as i know, ccp have recorded logs of all actions made by players, because every player has his / her own unique id, and with this im more than sure ccp have a method of 'filtering' out a single persons actions and viewing that one log and every aciton that person has made. in doing this you should beable to see for example what time the person 'enterd the system' for example lets say on the log it says 21:04:33 (the time the made that action) and lets say no other actions were made for 8 minutes or so then they look at the recoded log and it shows a ship destruction at 21:12:33, an 8 minute gap, with absolutly no activity what so ever. was the person controling the ship just sitting there, making no actions?, no attempt to save him/her self from the aggressor? common sense tells us that this person was totaly unable to do anyhitng and most likely spent the entire time waiting for something to load, this in my opinion"
1/30/2010,"(cont from above.)does deserve a reimbursement, just nor another quick example lets say the perosn enters system / grid at 21:04:33 then at 21:05:12 locks a target, 21:05:16 activated several moduals, :21:06:01 activates a repair modual etc etc, these are obvious actions that the player had control over his ship and that that a gm can see this by reading the logs.in my opinion latter example of not being able to do anyhitng in any way what so ever deserves a reimbursement because there is no way of doing anyhitng to defend yourself / prevent yourself from being killed and that in my opinion is not fair, that is not legitimate game mechanics and your game is not supposed to work like this (altho you do advertise like that in promo videos !!? but this is not about advertisement). now before anyone tries to tell me that the issue of frozen screens due to extreme system overloads cannot be fixed 'just like that', i do understand the soloution of solving this problem is a very hard one and will take alot of time and dedication untill ccp can reahc an acceptable level. this is nothing to do with the lag / freezing problem. this is to do with ccp refusing to reimburse under these conditions, which is wrong, especially since we are paying customers this is in no way how it should be. alot of people say 'just relax, take some time calm down. get yourself back out there and get a new ship + fittings and try again next time' no!, not everyone has the spare time to play this game long enough to do such things. lets say you only have a few hours spare a week to play, you spend 9 months scrapping the 'isk' together to buy a nice ship (in my personal case it was a 1.8 billion isk dreadnaught), and all is lost due to this horirble factor and ccp just say 'no we cant tell if its legit or not'. this is totaly out of order, saying 'just go get another one', you should be putting the time and effort into these petitions and investigating the logs to try to prove if a ship was a legit loss or not!. no one should have to do all the work over if they lost there ship in this way.in my opinion ccp are extremely happy just to say to us 'no reimbursement', 'go do the work all over again', aslong as we continue to pay subscriptions! well ccp you are out of order to say that. untill you have fixed the freezes in big fights you should be putting the time and effort into each petition and look at the facts, statistics and logs and then try to judge if it was legit or not, rather than just copy and paste the same useless message over and over that no one wants to hear. we pay you to do your job so why dont you start putting some effort in and do your job."
1/30/2010,or they mashed jump and then got up to go the bathroom and got popped while they were having a ****.how is ccp supposed to know which?
1/30/2010,"the only time these instances ocour is when large fleet warefare happens, and when you are in large fleet warfare and you just tried to enter the 'fight' you dont go and have a '****'. common sense will tell you this, and hopefully ccp will start reading their logs in more depth to try and figure out which are real or not."
1/30/2010,i love assumption based proposals.... make for a good laugh.oh and i don't deny the problem... but your assuming a great deal here.not supporting.
1/30/2010,"the only thing i really assumed is that ccp have recorded logs of all acitons made, but it owuld make no sense if they did not, every player that makes an action is recorded via that players unique id for example that id looks somehting like(player name)l > <b><url=showinfo:1373//1173009641>s(player name)</url></b>the long number is the player id, and as far as i know ccp can just find all logs made by that player. hence judging if they player was active during the time of his loss or not."
1/30/2010,lag is a well known phenomenon amongst the player base and it's effects are pretty well documented. if you are not compos mentis enough to realise that jumping 200 capitals into an already strained system with around 800 in system and already loaded is going to end in tears then you should probably try a simpler game like pong.everybody knows about lag and if you are deliberately exposing yourself to such a situation then you deserve all you get.
1/30/2010,this definetly needs to be classified as bug and something should be implemented to avoid this.easiest thing would be to just make invulnerable all ships entering system (jumping in / entering game) until they succesfully load system. as long as they are in progress of 'loading...' they cannot be targeted - same as players who initiated warp cannot be locked. as soon as they enter system appriopriate message is sent to server and ship is valid target for attacks.
1/30/2010,we only tryed top play the dominion-trailer. something went wrong....
1/30/2010,"so what you are trying to say is the way sov wareware should be played is, first in system wins ?. i do argee with the player sbeing invunerable untill fully loaded, sounds like a fairly good idea, at least that way you have a chance"
1/30/2010,"people are looking at this the wrong way.what ccp should realize is that they are reaching a limit, ever noticed how problems starts to show in various regions accros the server when it gets over 50k user count ? yet despite this ccp continues to market their game as much as possible just look at the dominion changes and the dominion trailer, ccp markets and encourages 0.0 wars, yet if you attempt the real thing the server falls over, time and time again.0.0 wars are really simple now because of these problems. 1st one in with numbers wins the systemthis problem can only get worse as the player base grows and it will.more and more petitions will plague ccp as their customers tries to enjoy eve but cant because of ever growing problems that affects everyone at once.think of it as a small town that crew into a city...then think of those narrow roads that once worked perfectly in the past but is now gridlockedccp helmar, you know what im talking about, i watched you in some promotional video during the alliance tournament where you talked about how eve outgrew far beyond what you imagined. you gave us something great, and every eve player thanks you for it as you bring us hours of entertainment. lets keep it that waydont be too quick to put the blame on blob wars, its something that will happen, when your defending or attacking a system you go in with force.if ccp refuses to address these petitions then i ask that they atleast tell us how hard they are working behind the scenes on a coding/hardware level.to concludei love the dominion changes, i really do, the new planets and features are awesome and i mean it. but you must remember you cant continue to construct new levels on a building without reinforcing its foundation."
1/30/2010,"no, what i'm saying is that there are known problems with dominion (also from my understanding about that particular engagement you were already in system but chose to give up that advantage by ragejumping out, i digress, caod -> that way). if you want to fight in these conditions then you have to accept the consequences of doing so. there are also several methods and workarounds for combating particularly nasty and laggy grid/system loading issues.i'm not saying it's perfect but if you are deliberately exposing yourself to these conditions then you should not have your ship reimbursed. i've died to lag a couple of times without getting a shot off. it's frustrating but i took it on the chin and realised that i knew what i was getting into."
1/30/2010,for once... i agree with lark.putting yourself in harms way for the sake of emo-raging over a problem is beating a dead horse.yes we know there's a problem... get back in line along with the other hundreds of complaints.ccp will get to it when they will get to it.demanding reimbursement is just adding insult to injury.
1/30/2010,"not supported.after atlas vs wi., pl/goons vs it in y-2 you pulled that stunt.iirc pl didnt get their titans reimbursed either.just in case you want to try the stunt again. maybe talk to nc how to cyno in a fleet without blackscreening and dying."
1/30/2010,"not that i disagree as such, but a better solution is for ccp to figure whatever they did to break the servers in the dominion patch and undo it so that we can have semi-playable fights in the first place.its not like ccp can reimburse the hours of our lives we all spend staring at a black screen, which is arguably more valuable than our pretend dead internet spaceships anyway."
1/30/2010,"currently, there exists no way to export the status of blueprints in your hangars. you can get a list of which blueprints they are, but not if they are originals, copies, or their me/pe/run levels. it would be very database intensive to offer this information in a regular api.i would propose that ccp offer create a new api that would be created and cached for every player and corporation in a downtime once per month (the 15th, for example). players could retrieve the api anytime, but it would show their blueprint status as of the previous 15th of the month. while it would be useful to have available much more frequently, this would also generate a significant database load. having it available once per month is a balance of useful/database load. people and corporations can still import the bulk of their blueprint library, and manually update the important parts until the next months update."
1/30/2010,try evehq.should be some nice features there for that.if not... carry on.
1/30/2010,"as i stated originally, currently the api just lists the blueprints you have, and no further information. nothing about me, pe, original or copy, or runs. eve hq can try to match up some information when you install a job (can the api does show the full information for running jobs), but installing hundreds of jobs just to get blueprint information is rather tedious. additionally, it doesn't guarantee a firm match even then, because the ids it uses from the api pull can change with each pull."
1/30/2010,"i don't know just how server-intensive it would be, but i'm in favour of this proposal if it's the best ccp will do. half a bp api is better than no api at all."
1/30/2010,i pretty much support anything making the api better.
1/30/2010,"not supported.the way i've always seen it, unguided missiles were for taking out stuff bigger than yourself. so rockets were for taking out cruisers, hams for bs and torps were for caps and above. ive always thought this was the justification for their higher damage.at best they should be used for taking out something of the same size when lit up with a whole bunch of tp."

1/30/2010,the topic basically states it all:please move the rigging skills out of 'mechanic' and into their own subsection in the skilltree.would clean things up alot and probably isnt all that hard to do - even though i have no clue as how things are implemented. ;)

1/30/2010,"since insurance is purchased in game for ships. why not have an option to buy it for cargo? that way when moving an expensive cargo, you can insure it against loss by all the high sec gank squads."
1/30/2010,there is.. its called collateral.yes i know that's not what your asking for.but your not going to get what your asking for.there's no real point to insure cargo that is not likely going to be there for long.if your worried about shipping something valuable in any area you should hire someone to do it for you and put collateral on it.that way if they do get hit... you get paid back.problem with that... being a hauler myself... collateral sucks ass.so yeah... welcome to eve online.
1/30/2010,"a game mechanic for cargo insurance would be trivial to defraud, it's extent would dwarf the insurance fraud on t1 ships. the perpetrators would keep the cargo and gain an insurance payout, therefore it would be a massive isk source and lead to isk hyper-inflation."
1/30/2010,this!
1/30/2010,"way to take it off-topic, helghast. the discussion is on gate guns, not pos guns. gates are far more likely to be battlegrounds than poses, and poses have the guns there mainly as a defence for the (automated) structure, not the players."
1/30/2010,seriosuly people... the point is to encourage population growth in 0.0... gate guns help with that.nothing is to stop a 35 drake gang from flying in the front door to wreck some havoc.what's the big deal?even a small little t1 gang is going to suffer when they slam into a bubble camp with carriers and hacs.this is a proverbial drop in the pond.... ripples would be nothing to fret over your pvp hunger.
1/30/2010,"the only things gate guns would provide would be the ability for the people inhabiting the systems to become lax. you know what laxness in a high-risk environment does?also nice of you to mention a 'bubblecamp with carriers and hacs'. it seems you've never been to 0.0. hacs and carriers would do nothing to stop a roaming frigate gang, but these turrets would. adapt to your aggressors to take them out, and stop relying on automated defenses in a game that tries to make its players do everything themselves."
1/30/2010,"as a free pilot in free space i do not support this proposal. small roaming groups and solo ships need to remain viable, even at gates."
1/30/2010,defences already exist for your systems in the form of friendly gangs. if you are unable to secure your own systems from intruders then you don't deserve it. this proposal would help to eliminate solo and small gang roaming and encourage blobbing.
1/30/2010,"you do realise that if guns are on gates, you can atempt attacking people away from gates??? could be a through! not alll fights need to happen at system gates. or atleast not in turret optimal. (which is small for small gangs)if hacs cannot stop a frigate roam, then how will a pos gun with worse tracking and slower lock-time then that of a hac do?if you are unhappy about the guns, blow them up. this will be the beginning to destructible infrastructure that alliences have to maintain and repair."
1/30/2010,they cant camp a gate anymore. and the situation is worse than in lowsec ... there the gate guns only shoot them with gcc. in 0.0 the guns would already fire for not being blue.
1/30/2010,"if 0.0 was magically changed to wormhole space i think alot of problems would be solved. you wouldn't be able to amass 5 alliances and 1000+ during the time frame a system is open to yours. your tactics would be to scout,assess and be fighting in less than an hour. once a beach head was established slowly reinforcements would arrive. it would be actually be a fight. not the craptastic blob they are now. it would be much better. but someone long ago said epic ""battles = 1000+"""

1/30/2010,"not only are you wrong, but you are dead wrong. ccp nozh adjusted missiles with quantum rise because the way missile tracking worked was faulty, in addition to the fact that he and zulupark removed speed as a legitimate tactic for ships larger than a frigate. the problem is that he replaced the significantly flawed missile tracking method with another significantly flawed missile tracking mechanic. missiles were not overpowered before qr (except torps), they are not underpowered now either(except rockets and lights)... well, they wouldn't be if only nozh didn't do a half-assed job on rebalancing missiles and speed. and i was here for 3.5 years, so i know why i know.edit: as for the topic, the problem of 30 second delay can easily be solved by fixing the frikkin missile skills, and addressing the fact that 3750m/s is ridiculously slow for zero-g propulsion for such a small mass."
1/30/2010,"i'm for anything that makes caldari ships (aside from ew, which are already quite good) more viable in pvp. i started out caldari, but have since been forced to crosstrain to be viable in pvp."
1/30/2010,"implement ""fleet engagement launcher charges""basically missiles that work like a turret: ultra-fast, good range (instant) damage. explosion-velocities of the torpedos and ****e dps to compensate for the non-existant tracking issue."
1/30/2010,just to clarify i'm not suggesting breaking petitions down by gm name. merely satisfaction across the userbase :)
1/30/2010,you want that information? then go build a website and run a poll.your wasting your time... to what end? what would it gain? justification over some subtle fact or theory?ccp is a business that chooses to do as they please... even if the csm brought this forward (i seriously doubt this) they are likely going to be told no regardless of how loud you complain.i'd be more interested in bug reports and statistics over fixes in the game.at least that is far more useful to the public than what your asking for.

1/31/2010,"thanks for your insightfull input. care to elaborate?eagle uses t1 ammo by default, because it is designed to do so. if you are using spike with eagle , i can't say anything to make you see the truth. you are right though, i should use tremor with munnin. since all hacs have roughly 110-120 km targeting range and you are fighting aligned, it means that your targets are 70-100km away.therefore i was focusing on the 80km optimal(tactical range) to get dps and alpha. if you include fallof for each hac, you'll see that they can hit beyond targeting range. shooting further away than 110 kms is rarely encountered though.these numbers are calculated with a 15% increase to rails damage modifier and a 10% pg increase to the eagle included to demonstrate what this proposal is all about:munnin (19.5k ehp):t2 720mm arties emp m (t1) = 357 (+80 from drones) dps @ 29+36 (2949 volley). tracking 0.04482t2 720mm arties tremor (t2) = 238 dps @ 81+22 (1966 volley). tracking 0.00945 <-(tremor tracking sucks, but lets you fit 3x gyros)eagle (19.5k ehp):t2 250mm rails am (t1) = 325 dps @ 47+20 (1138 volley). tracking 0.04967t2 250mm rails uranium (t1) = 270 dps @ 86+29 (948 volley). tracking 0.03148 <-(only thing eagle has got going)deimos (20k ehp):t2 250mm rails am (t1) = 360 dps (+158 drone dps) @ 23+37 (1345 volley). tracking 0.05101t2 250mm rails spike (t2) = 240 dps @ 84+37 (897 volley). tracking 0.00719zealot(21k ehp):t2 heavy beams multifreq (t1) = 448dps @ 23+10 (1110 volley). tracking 0.05362t2 heavy beams aurora (t2) = 299dps @ 93+13 (740 volley). tracking 0.01031 <-(highest dps at range)i have to thank those that inputed suggestions about better fits and ammo usage, especially those corpmates of mine that provided data for the munnin and deimos fit.as an aside, deimos is the least range - oriented hac and thus is very difficult to catch up to the rest of the others. zealot is the easiest to fit, but that is countered by the fact that it has no utility high and cannot fit a cloak. and i hear rigs are good to fit and medium ones are really cheap."
1/31/2010,"you do realise, that maybe different hac's where designed on different optimal ranges? it's like comparing dps from blasters and puces at 30km, with blaster using iron. that's a flawed comparison. is eagle does not have a damage mod, ofcource it will have lower damage output but grater optimal."
1/31/2010,"you do realise that both zealot and munnin have an optimal range bonus and a damage bonus?as for the range, fit a munnin with 720mm arties, no range mod and load tremor m, w/ a lvl 5 pilot. range: 81+22. how about that for design range? i rest my case.at the same time, when you compare the current damage potential for these ships, you realise that both deimos and eagle lack severely behind. being able to hit beyond your targeting range for laughable damage is not a role a hac was meant to fill. this proposal is not about hacs, i am using them as a focus to represent the fact that rails are lacking as long range weapon systems. if you also examine sniper bses, you'll notice that with the current buff for projectiles, rokh, hype and mega under-perform. by the way, even 15% increase in damage will not make rail platforms have better dps than amarr, it will just let them operate in the same ballpark."
1/31/2010,"responding to all of these because they share the same theme of not wanting rails boosted because of a perception that they will dominate. put simply this is not the case for a number of reasons.for one the idea that rails get range while other weapons systems get damage is a bit of a flawed one as 'having' range only means something if you do top damage at that range since last i checked eve isn't a long ranged tickle-contest. this dosen't mean you should outpreform shorter ranged weapons systems but it does mean that you -have- to outpreform their falloff, the current iteration only allows a rokh with rails to get peak dps right at the lock limit as displayed here*. the final peak on the rokh there before the falloff descent is spike at 253km even then it just barely outpreforms the falloff of the tach apoc.a 5% bump would bring a rokh with 3x magstabs to 337dps with spike over it's current 320, comparing that to the 400 an apoc gets is embarrassing doing 20% less damage for 10% more range isn't exactly balanced as it is now and the 5% bump won't change that. 20% bump in damage brings the rokh to 385 which is 4% less damage, now technically you could argue that the rokh's getting too much range for that sort of damage, and i'd agree, if not for the lock limit. however so long as that's in place a large portion of the ranges where the rokh with rails would preform best is simply unusable which means to make it useful at all you have to put some pressure on the apoc's position.damage wise the other contender, the megathron, dosen't compete anywhere currently, it's 350 dps falls 30+ km short of the apoc's 400 and the 20% boost would bring it's damage with spike to 420, 5% more damage for 15% less range then the tach apoc. even with beams the difference is only 12% more damage for 11% more range, almost a perfect exchange of range for damage with the infirior preformer, mega beams.now those that would argue that lasers cost cap and thus should do more damage clearly haven't experienced the pain of using a caldari sniper boat as here you can see that once you put them on the apoc the disadvantage evaporates, only the abaddon seems to struggle more then the rokh with cap and well, it's an abaddon, it does that(though admittedly might need to be fixed).finnally if you're asking what the maelstrom gets it's alpha and plenty of it, which is somewhat niche but still a usable advantage.in closing i think rails should get ~20% more damage and face 10-20% less cap drain given they use ammo and aren't meant to be fitted on the biggest pool of cap for battleships, the apoc.*light blue is the rokh, red and yellow are beam and tachyon apocs respectively green and grey are beam and tachyon abaddons respectively and the dark blue is a mael. other ships not included as they wouldn't achieve a peak above the ships already shown."

1/31/2010,"but, but but, i also means the racial damage bonus sucks on the hound / other stealth bombers. so i'm gonna do the same as the op did and make a waaaah waaaaah and bawwww and booohooo cry topic so we can have the racial damage bonus removed on stealth bombers for rof bonus or damage bonus instead in the first place. and then i will make one topic for the titans.that sounds like a very good idea, so there will be no points really to use a purifier for example over a hound. a stellar idea.yeah you know, racial damage bonuses sucks, right?."
1/31/2010,"do that if you want. but you forgot that those are all the same classes , all stealth bombers have the same amount racial dmg bonuses and it is not 5% but 15%/lvl for the torps and titans can only fit 1 dmg type doomsdays. but then look at hac ,do all hacs only get bonus for their racial dmg type? no only the cerberus does. that is a huge imbalance, right there. the matars can use emp and get their full bonus applied to it , they use em type dmg much more effectively than eighter missile caldari or zealot(the ship which race has em as their racial dmg type), that makes no sense.or phased plasma vs deimos ability to do heat dmg.the projectiles were designed and balanced choosable dmg type in mine ,so were the missiles. but then only projectiles can use this after bonuses applied.--> see totally imbalancedif cerberus can only get bonus for their racial dmg type missiles so should vagabonds only get bonus for fusion m/nuclear m only.--> see totally imbalancedso yes racial dmg bonuses sucks if only one race have it in a ship class.racial dmg bonus doesnt suck if every race have it for the same ship class like stealth bombers or titans."
1/31/2010,"that's a very flawed logic. if you don't know why, then i suggest you should get some serious help to really find that out.one of the things is that your thinking that because projectiles / other gun weapon types can do that and that, then missiles should be able to do the same. missiles and turrets are 2 totally different things, and should work in 2 totally different ways to.well just to let you know. the explosive damage bonus on the hound i something i really like. and it seems that you didn't take any hints on my reply that you replied to that what i said about creating a topic and whine that omgomg waaaaah please remove the racial damage bonus on the stealt bombers was a joke.it was just to illustrate how stupid it would be.and this topic is stupid to and very few are supporting it. 57 supports it out of 473 replies. yeah, this sounds like a good idea. so it's never gonna happen. so this topic can just be closed right now.if this topic have had 400 supports now, then it might have been something else, and it would mean it would be a problem, but it's not with 57 supports.like we all say, don't fix anything that isn't broken."
1/31/2010,"sounds like you're looking to give lowsec more of a piratey feel, but the problem is that no matter how much you spruce up the ""dark underbelly"" furniture, the fact remains that the entire lifestyle is pointless if lowsec isn't profitable for the empire folk to come down there and make their fortune/get hunted.the key to a populated lowsec is not to make it a better place for pirates, but to make it a better place for everyone else, who the pirates can then prey upon.and here is the especially big kicker: carebear mcmissionrunner needs to be able to make so much isk in lowsec that they have a good chance of getting ganked on a semi-regular basis, and still coming out ahead of empire earnings. in short, you need to be able to easily pull in >50 mil/hr in lowsec. and since that would destroy the game's economy, it isn't going to happen.empire incentives are just too high for lowsec to compete with all of its risks.realistically, eve has the tools to let players solve this problem themelves. the problem is that if some corp took it upon themselves to police and tax a lowsec constellation or two in order to grow a ratting/trading population, that simply instantly becomes ""the place to pirate"" and there are far more people looking to prey upon those trying to build up an economy than there are people to support it. the ratio to ""upstanding citizens trying to build wealth and infrastructure"" to ""pirates who just want a piece of someone's pie"" is way too far off to be effective.in short: pirates prey on society, they're the seedy underbelly. society thrives on social contract theory. eve's population ignores social contract theory. society ceases to exist (in lowsec), the underbelly has nothing to prey on, and ceases to exist. lowsec lays barren."
1/31/2010,"incorrect, the point isn't about pirates vs's non pie's. it's about making low-sec a viable place to live without *****ing out an empire alt to pay for things. mission runners really dont need more places to play, the epitome of what they want already exist in high sec. this is about the people who dont like high sec and don't like missions and who already want to live in low sec, about giving them the means to do so. that's all. leave the pie's vs bears out of this."
1/31/2010,"as above.. the point isnt to make piarcy easier, its to make lowsec a place with some substance, wjere the pirates fight each other for dominanice, where anit pirate or strong industrials with combat capability can carve out a little turf for themselves, for legal or illegal activities. it isnt about getting people to visit lowsec to make isk/get gamked, its abouit ,aking lowsec a viable place to live, with its own politics and culture.."
1/31/2010,"on item 3: if things gotten from the lp stores of pirate faction agents where illegal in high-sec, unless smuggled to a specific type of agents in high sec who can make the item legal, after which it can be sold on the normal market in high sec, then you have a valid smuggling mechanic that isn't based on npc items that players have no use for.on most of the other ideas i have this to say: most players who stick to high-sec don't do so because the rewards in high-sec are higher, they do it because they have no interest in getting into pvp action on anyone's terms but their own, if ever. if all the lvl 4 agens where moved into low-sec, a lot of missioning high-sec players would simply do more lvl 3s, and earn less, and be very disgrunted. but most won't go to low-sec."

1/31/2010,this was already brought up- and solved. not sure if it was this thread or a similar one where the question was posed and answered. its really not a huge deal. the tl/dr version- it wouldnt be necessary to recode anything other then the mechanics you wanted changed. the servers can easily be made to tell the difference between bonused ehp and ships ehp.
1/31/2010,"this tbh.did you ever think about the fact that some players just want to jump on for an hour or 2 blow some stuff up then jump off? not spend a couple of hours *shudders* grinding for isk.just because a char is old in the game doesn't mean they have mountains of isk. my char is 2 and a half years old and i only sit on 300mil, which pvping is all i do and if you have a bad run and die lots then the loses start adding up and next thing you know you are below 100mil."

1/31/2010,this idea fails at the point it doesn't take in account that living in low sec is not easy and shooting people actually punishes you quite a bit.only thing which -might- need looking at is hi sec ganking and chaining sec up.
1/31/2010,"i agree with the core concept that high security status should be awarded. paying taxes and being a good citizen should provide access to more public empire services. currently, keeping a high sec status doesn't really matter until you get to the point where you're being punished.perhaps base insurance rates on security status to some degree? or decrease empire fees."

1/31/2010,don't care. seems like a trivial thing to me.
1/31/2010,this change would also be useful in pvp where people like me tend to turn off all effects in an effort to reduce lag. so i often have no idea if capacitor warfare is being used.

1/31/2010,exactly - now that you mention it - why hasn't this already been done ccp? good idea.
1/31/2010,"it has become pretty standard to see engagements with way more than 256 pilots on each side, thus hitting the limit of the current fleet hierarchy system. while often it is reasonable to split up the forces into multiple fleets, it should be possible to have more pilots in one, if the fcs so desire. this can be achieved by adding another hierarchy level to the fleet system, above the position of fleet commander. a tentative name for that position is fleet admiral or fleet general. this would ofc also require a new leadership skill, which would have to be rank 16 (wc is rank 8, fc is rank 12).thus, the new maximum fleet size would become (256x5)+1 = 1281."
1/31/2010,"hum, 1200 pilotes fighting in a system already creating huge lag. so 2*1281 possibly fighting..."
1/31/2010,"yes , we need bigger blobs. current ones are to small."
1/31/2010,this edition is badly needed. people seem to be acting like fools thinking that the 256 hierarchy is somehow limiting blobs. 1: i don't want to limit blobs i like big fight and i cannot lie..... 2: people are simply flying 3 different fleets in tandem so you might as well for convenience sake expand the brackets.256 as the maximum hierarchy was invented with the introduction of revelations 1 in winter 2006 and is therefore outdated.
1/31/2010,"neither lag nor the fleet size limitation is keeping people from bringing 500+ blobs. we are quickly approaching battles with 2000 pilots. my proposal just pays respect to the evolution of fleet sizes and removes a moderate annoyance.if you want to stop blob warfare, you'd have to change game mechanics, which is a completely different matter."
1/31/2010,"yeah, this has been needed for a while."
1/31/2010,only if you include some cool heavy duty battleship+ size ship that gives out new bonuses. the entire leadership aspect of the game needs a revamp.anyone care to propose something that vastly includes all of this? or group of people for that matter...

1/31/2010,"you mean, like a titan? +37.5% hp is nothing to sneeze at, i hear. i'm all for new leadership stuff, if it's reasonable and well-designed, but what we have now isn't bad."

1/31/2010,"you comparison is flawed. scramblers and webs are not inter- replacable modules, they have completely different purposes. it's like comparing apples and oranges"
1/31/2010,"a module which reduces that stat of an enemy ship with 60% seems pretty good to me.and your comparison with scram is flawed. what is your scram going to do against ship with ab (yes they exist in pvp)? what are you going to do when a scram isnt enough to slow down your opponent, use a second scram?"
1/31/2010,"1090% agreed.the speed 'nerf' was utterly rendered moot when they also castrated webs. the end result... no change whatsoever, and an entire class of ships was rendered little better than dust collectors.a max skilled huginn/rapier needs 2 or 3 webs to slow down an interceptor, and even then they can easily get beyond web range before they're slowed down enough to catch.the old web strengths need to be returned."
1/31/2010,"the old webs were insta death for small ships.atm you got some chance to speed tank under web, unlike in the past.not supported."
1/31/2010,this.if you want 90% webs then fly serp shigs or marauders.
1/31/2010,to be honest your comparison of webs and scrams are just insane. scrams are used for pointing a target so he/she cant warp off. try just webbing a target and he/she just warps of faster. i thing webs are balanced as they are. as just stated actually have a chance of speed tanking with webs as they are now.i you have problems catching them even when you web them you either need more webs or a faster ship. i can strongly recommend going minmatar for speed

1/31/2010,"agreed, mining missions are worse than courier missions. (and that's saying something) i highly support changes to make them better."
1/31/2010,"teadaze - come on. you grouse about someone putting words in your mouth and then you go and put words in mine.no proposal i've suggested (which have had several possible options) would ever provide ""100%"" security for the ship. that's simply untrue. making it difficult to steal (as opposed to ridiculously easy as it is now) is not 100% secure at all. that's the garage alt route.even if a supercarrier could be anchored in such a way that it was entirely 'unstealable' it would still not be anything like 100% secure because it's floating there in space! how long do you think it would be before an enemy scout found it, reported it and then an enemy fleet showed up to take down the pos and kill it?it's a couple dozen billion isk target! 100% secure? i don't know of any system in 0.0 that is secure enough to prevent a determined strike like that from eventually succeeding. i have had to run large gate camps in the middle of nc space in heartland systems just because there was no one around to chase off the gang.there would always be risk in leaving them unattended and, truth to be told, few would use the system after the first few got popped. they'd go right back to garage alts, i expect.me - i'd move mine around to keep that from happening at least easily, but that's also a fair bit of work. if ""every"" or even a lot of cap pilots got them there would be a lot of lost supercarriers until people learned how best to hide them and even that would be tough.100% security is not and has not ever been the goal. just something that isn't ridiculous."
1/31/2010,this is a pointless thread.op should bother to sum up his points. this has been a waste of my time.
1/31/2010,"tea should be the last one to talk about 100% security. you support use of garage alt, and have your super capital magically vanish into nothingness. that's somehow more risky then leaving it at a pos, that can be taken down, right?"
1/31/2010,"i do not like this proposal. if you need to 'park it' buy supercapital alt, put it on same account as your main and if you need to fly it just log to that character. if you are opposed of alts then tough luck. nothing can be done for you. you can always use capital ship maintenace bay btw if you are willing to 'park it' without pilot somewhere. it is as good as 'anchoring' it's just those with proper acsess in your corporation can take it."
1/31/2010,"fair enough, here you go:supercapital ownership (that's supercarriers and titans) is borked. because these ships are extremely valuable and cannot be docked anyplace the current 'standard' for players who own them is to have an alt who logs out in them making a ship which is supposed to never be able to leave space or dock anywhere magically disappear. it is then 100% secure, immune to scouting or attack except when actually in use.the only other realistic option is to have a character sit in it 100% of the time because of the ease of theft that leaving such ships at a pos entails. because of 'bumping' and pos lack of security such ships are ludicrously easy to steal if left unattended. being restricted to sitting forever in a ship which cannot dock that also cost you a zillion isk doesn't allow for very enjoyable play and is a ludicrous 'limitation' as it almost entirely keeps the character from being able to play the game.security for such ships needs to be improved so that there are other options available. one might be to allow a character to 'anchor' a supercapital when not in use. another might be to improve pos security (which needs to happen for lots of other reasons as well) and other might be to fix bumping, because right now it's ludicrous. yet another might be to simply not allow logging out in such ships but that has other issues that need attending to (like what does a player do if they're on holiday or some such?)to sum up:garage alts are bad because they are too good.owning a supercap without one isn't practical at all (the risk is far too high) if unattended and gameplay suffers unreasonably if you elect to just never leave it.these things mean that some other option should be available to players who wish to fly one of these ships."

1/31/2010,"now i think it is mostly universally recognized that the procurer is one of the most useless ships in the game. since, as a mining ship, it really fails to mine a large quantity of minerals in a given time, and at the same time, it takes only 15ish hours to train up to mbarge iii in which you could buy a retriever which has double the mining capacity.right now i am looking at the training prerequisites to fly a procurer and a retriever. they are identical except that a retriever needs mb iii.currently. the time it would take to train for a procurer would be 11 days (this would vary depending on learning skills). that means there is a major gap between training for a procurer, and then training for a retriever.my thought, is that mining barge's prerequisites could be changed to require industry lvl iii instead of industry lvl v which would basically cut 7 days out of that training time. while at the same time, the retriever and covetor can have a prerequisite of industry lvl v added to them. (since the only prerequisite to fly either ship is mining barge iii and v respectively).the only thing that would change, is that a procurer would not take so long to train for. obviously anyone dedicated to becoming a miner will go to a retriever->covetor->hulk. this proposal is simple to let non-dedicated miners get to the procurer.thoughts?support?"
1/31/2010,"that seems fairly sensible. it's not like making a procurer easier to fly breaks anything, after all."
1/31/2010,"currently i've only ever seen one procurer in game. and i was baffled wondering why the person had even purchased one as i sat in my shiny (brand new) retriever.i think doing this would allow people who don't want to train so long access to strip miners. and would make the procurer worth getting, even if the one reason is just that it is quicker to train to."

1/31/2010,supported but only on the condition 'goons' are invited first to go through en-masse then quickly shut it again
1/31/2010,"don't big wormholes also screw up the time differences between point a and b of a wormhole?maybe it's thousands and thousands of years for us, but just mere seconds for the sol system people (earth)."
1/31/2010,"i'd love having more space that doesn't have 0.0 alliances in it that shoot anything that isn't one of them. as for lag reduction... players tend to group together, even if they don't have to. you'd need aditional game mechanics that steer people towards spreading out in whatever new space you open, rather than converging to create jita all over again. i would however love to find out whatever happened to the people on the other side of the eve wormhole. even if it was just that they figured out how to send communication signals from one end to the other, to create an ingredient for the writers to use in their chronicles. so, perhaps not for the reasons you mentioned, i would still love for the eve gate to be re-opened."
1/31/2010,"1) rp-wise, earthlings were constantly at war over resources and such. that's why they started colonizing on this side of the eve gate.- so either they have killed each other off in the thousands of years since it closed.- or they are so advanced that it'd put the jove to shame. in which case, they could easily have technology you can't even dream of. like 1 mil km doomsday rockets on their frigates. or a smartie that deals a bazillion damage to anything within 5 jumps. or a carrier that deploys fighters piloted by chuck norris and vin diesel.2) if they were still there, wouldn't it be likely they would have been trying to get back here ever since? especially if all the resources were used up. you think salvage ninjas are bad now, just imagine all the earth refugees pouring through. cannibal npcs who scoop your podsicles...3) all i'd like to see, is the description to hold to its word. ""but even then the turbulence is enough to rip to pieces any vessel foolish enough to wander close to it."" and yet, it's just a background image. honestly, the first time i made the trek, i was expecting to wake up in a med clone."
1/31/2010,"perceived problem:as i am sure others will, too, i tend to cruise onto this forum once in a while when i have some extra time on my hands to check out proposals and voice my support or disdain. after just getting the hang of it and showing some thumbs i quickly encounter a message:""you are going too fast! wait five minutes and try again.""no wonder proposals don't get more support.proposed solution: modify the post limit on this board so that you can post as many replies as you want but only one per thread every five minutes. keep the time limit on posting new threads, of course."
1/31/2010,if someone logs off/disco/not logged in - they should not be allowed to receive remote repairs.i'm sure this idea won't receive any flames...
1/31/2010,how would privateers save their ships without it?
1/31/2010,please explain why this is a problem?
1/31/2010,"i agree, even though this topic is old and undersupported and the proposal not entirely clear (disliking the or).suggest you re-propose a bit more clear sometime soon."
1/31/2010,"i'd change the proposal to be a time period determined by ccp to best balance server load and usefulness, but otherwise, i support. anything is better than nothing."
1/31/2010,the guys a douche- needs to be permabanned for the joke he has turned the csm into.and while were on the subject of banning douches may i put shigs up for consideration?
1/31/2010,csm was a joke well before lark...
1/31/2010,sounds reasonable
1/31/2010,not supported. the stunt from mazzilliu was worse for the csm representation imho.
1/31/2010,u mad?
1/31/2010,i'm seeing mad
1/31/2010,"i was unaware of the fact that we could simply elect to ban players. i'll get my list...</sarcasm>do i think what lark did was wrong? obviously.do i think he got off too lightly? yes, i really do.do i want the player base to have the power to initiate the banning of other players? are you completely insane?also...he definitely mad."
1/31/2010,nah... he's just jealous.future mutant.. great spam/troll... epic fail on delivery.
1/31/2010,"that may be so, but your falling for a weak troll. :)"
1/31/2010,much needed.
1/31/2010,yes
1/31/2010,"absolutely signed.on my last killmail i did take a little over 1.1k damage in total in my loki, but on the killmail it shows 0 damage. just look here.yeah, nice fix there ccp. does your qa guys even use 1 min to even test out stuffs before you guys release a fix / patch?."
1/31/2010,putting my autograph on this. i still believe that the best solution is official killboards. this would do so much to remove the usual cooking of mails and hidding of losses.
1/31/2010,"just look at d-g report, half the kms are wrong."
1/31/2010,supported.else i would want a forum setting for not displaying animated signature images.
1/31/2010,"more damage than their guided counterparts, i didnt bring turrets into this at all. the high damage turrets all have their price to pay for their larger dps compared to their long ranged turret counterparts, unguided missiles happen to be range + explosion radius."
1/31/2010,"they usually pay with range for the higher dmg. making close range missiles more dependant on target sign than the long range missiles makes no sense,or they should get more dmg to start with.you can argue that unguided missiles are designed to be used against bigger targets but then they should do much more dmg agains those than same sized turrets to be balanced. if unguided m. only do as much dmg agains bigger ships as the close range turrets ,and do much less against same or small size there is a clear unbalance.does motion prediction applies for close range turrets too? yes it does ,thats why guided missile prediction should be applied to unguided missiles.btw missiles explosion velocities are way too small."
1/31/2010,"i'm gonna have to say no to this one. one of the major logistical hurdles of the new sovereignty system is the fact that you've got to take a npc-manufactured item which only fits in a freighter to your sovereign system.i'm all for more items made by players, but the assembly hall already had this thread, and there wasn't much support (under 50%). if there was a compensatory change to the game to match it which didn't cause a large number of players grief, i'd support it. as it stands right now, i cannot support the notion."
