9/1/2014,indeed. i agree.
9/1/2014,"they are welcome to come and try. the best people using isboxer have been able to do is run a fleet of bombers. anything more complex and they fail miserably. boo hoo., let's see those 100-200 isbboxer fleets come to null and try to do stuff. in pvp that is. i'm quite certain someone who can effectively run 100 miners is far better off to rent out a system in null and earn 50x more than they do in high-sec.but that's just me, i'd go for higher proffits if i could run 50+ accounts. i'd strip a large cluster in 2 hours."
9/1/2014,"is there actually any kind of an idea in here, or is the op just crying?"
9/1/2014,"it's the latter. the op also has a bug up their proverbial, over isboxer.but as yet, has failed to come up with any coherent argument on anything. just a lot of really bad shiptoasting.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
9/1/2014,"um my comparison was to a ""frigate"", where do you see me state a mining vessel (notice i did not say ""barge"" or ""exhumer"") should have the tank and dps of a battlship?oh wait.. i didn't."
9/1/2014,"so what if it's a ""mining"" ship?combat ships can mine cruisers with 2 mining lasers and the rest guns fill this role just peachy. and i see people doing this a lot. what is so difficult about imagining an industrial ship designed like this?so your essentially saying it is ok for a combat ship to mine. but it is not ok for a mining ship to be able to fight. that's a bit hypocritical there bub."
9/1/2014,"one of my characters corps has a doctrine fit for gank frigates that easily goes over 500 dps. and they use them consistently.i own 6 accounts also. (if someones next question was how many character do i have).yea the skiff is decent these days.i wasn;t meaning that ccp needed to edit the barges and exhuimers, i was thinking more along the lines of a new ship type. maybe with 4 guns and 2 lasers or something (like some retrofit cruiser miners use). just seems like since people do it with cruisers anyway, why not have an actually industrial ship for it?"
9/1/2014,"really? so the fact that someone just getting into a battleship can do just over the amount of damage you say a frigate can do, and you want more damage then you say a frigate can do, isn't asking for battleship damage on a mining barge? maybe you should read your own posts again.and a combat ship with 2 mining lasers doesn't get good mining yield, kind of like how a mining barge doesn't get good dps. funny how that works, isn't it? sure, you can put mining lasers on a combat ship. no one who knows better does, as that's like putting rlmls on a moros.since you're claiming to be a beta player and all, can you name one ship that used to have mining bonuses that wasn't a mining barge or exhumer? no, the venture and prospect don't count.nope, nothing hypocritical in pointing out the way ccp set up the way it works. keep trying though, maybe one day you'll actually make a point that isn't completely wrong.and i guarantee that fit, if it really exists, is dependent on having logi along to rep it. this means that if you have no logi, then you're still not going to get through a procurer's 64k ehp tank before it's drones melt you. if you do have logi, then you're going to win anyway, so why bring that much firepower?sure, 6 accounts in your same little highsec mining corp. your blatant lack of knowledge about various aspects of eve hints that you've never left highsec, regardless of your bloated claims.you say this now after every single attempt at getting miners buffed again has been shot down. this is the point where you concede that you have bad ideas, and go back to whining about one guy taking all your precious highsec ice."
9/1/2014,show fit.
9/1/2014,"hint: every t1 logistics cruiser and frigate used to be a mining ship.they got changed because they were awful at it.that said, op, why should a mining ship be able to do the same sort of damage as a battlecruiser at least? you can already get a pretty decent combat barge going with the skiff/procurer, especially in numbers.where is the tradeoff in your proposed ship? what does it sacrifice to gain it's massivley increased tank and gank? is it's mining yield somewhat worse than that of an ibis?"
9/1/2014,"i felt like this warranted a response. never said cloaked ships should be used for a tackle, now did i? infact, if you are using it for a tackle then you are doing something wrong. the amount of assumptions you just drew from that is... well to be frank, i have no ******* clue how you drew that assumptions. your constant attacks on me due to your failed argument is a tad silly really, shoo, be gone with thee, for your non-sense is not welcomed here.next! for different response. never said that now did i? i welcome a prey that can fight back, it can put up more of a challenge, however, if you look at the majority of targets. which let me remind you, that covert cloaking vessels at the moment are so nitched due to heavy handed nerfs that they are limited on what targets they can attacked. ie, targets that are basically defenseless, or attacking targets that can not move out of the line of fire of their, lets say bombs, and then escaping for a hit and run tactic, the problem is, many of these targets have advance warning long before the clocked vessel even gets on grid with them, allowing them to, warp away, and safe up in zones that would be suicide for a cloaker to get close, example death star posses. this forced players to come up with a clever, but boring solution. you know what that solution was? to make local lie to you. that right, their solution was set it up so that they restart the game every time, during downtime inside of the system. it not always to lock it down, but to get that kill. local is always reporting that they are there, even when they are technically not. that way someone is never sure if they are still there or not, so they must take a risk. do i go out there, and risk my ship, or do i stay in here, and constantly lose money. however, that being said, because of covert cloaks able ships are heavily nerfed, ie, they can't do much to targets outside of their special little box of targets that they can picked from. people have figured out how to get around that as well, the... invention of cloaked hot dropping."
9/1/2014,"yes you did.here is the quote again:so your problem is that the cloaker lands on gate, and the pve players runs away. thus you are trying to catch a pve player with a cloaking ship. explain to me how the problem can be that pve players run from cloakers if the cloaker isn't the pilot there to catch the pve player.you also imply thatwhich is wrong. they don't have to. they could use interceptors to catch their targets like a normal player.again, you certainly implied that should be the case. notice that the quote you pulled up there says nothing about whether or not they can fight back, it states that in your mind they shouldn't be able to run away, which from what i've read i'd agree with that analysis of your complaints. you don't like it that a pve player can run away when a cloaker shows up to shoot them. afk cloaking isn't a clever solution. interceptors are a clever solution, and they work very well. afk cloaking is a method for people to put in next to no effort and cause 24/7 threat and it's quite amusing when people try to claim that it's a reaction to local and their inability to us the right ships for the job.as for covert ops ships, they are in no way ""heavily nerfed"". again, you simply don't seem to understand what they are designed to be used for. they get used almost every single day in and out of null, because they are so useful and effective at what they do. they can provide on grid intel, covert scanning and warping (so your target doesn't know when you've found and landed on grid with them), surprise bombing runs (meaning a fleet has to remain aligned or risk heavy losses), cheap and effective force projection without having to use a titan, high damage against larger targets, the ability to become completely unprobable in a system, and that's without even considering that t3s are also covops capable which are incredibly versatile ships.what they aren't good at is flying in to catch active pve players. that's what interceptors are for."
9/1/2014,"and what am i supposed to make of this statement?if that is sarcasm i apologize for not recognizing it. so what do you suggest? the purpose of this thread is to find and discuss ways to make gameplay more interesting.nikk and i have discussed tradeoffs to ship balances to where pvp between pve and cloaked vessels would happen more often, we are seeking to give both an equal chance of success, the chance needs to be such as to encourage engagement, instead of running away. we also want to encourage active gameplay while discouraging afk gameplay.i welcome meaningful response, ideas, and conflicting views, provided they have substance."
9/1/2014,+1 would be awesome. we had the same problem you described just the other way around. where we staged from a pos and we had so many ships ready to use in it that we had a hard time to distinguish between our own unmanned ships inside the pos and neutrals 
9/1/2014,"no. part of the ~mystery~ of operating in wormholes is the lack of knowledge of other entities in the hole, piloted ship or not. if you're unwilling to do the due diligence of scanning down ships in a hole to check if they're piloted or not, you shouldn't be in a wormhole in the first place.besides this, you're asking for a sweeping change to the d-scanner/probing in every other region of the game with no regard to the consequences of it."
9/1/2014,
9/2/2014,"i'm kinda willing to hedge my bets it's nikk narrel on an alt char.please, take an interceptor or warpy cloaky and go through each null-sec system and check how many systems have industry at a certain level. let's only pick systems with at least l3 industry.(or you could persue dotlan for the same effect)then write those systems down and monitor them throughout the entire month (31 days). also note the changes in rises and drops of industry levels and those of neighbouring systems.that research will however only give you a rough turn-over for normal ore, not ice. for ice, check each null-sec system for poses and calculate aproximately how much ice needs to be mined/purchased to keep those towers up and functional. also account for jump bridge fuel, capital jump drive fuel and ofcourse search all killboards everyday for blops+covops vessels killing someone and add those to the tally of needed fuel every single day.<U+FFFD>after you've done your ""little"" research, you'll get a realistic idea on how much mining is actually done in null-sec that you claim is so very little or nonexistant now ""just because ccp said 80% of industry is done in high-sec).thank you for your attention so far, can you please stop posting stuff that doesn't hold water?edit: almost forgot. why would mining barges need more defenses? they are specialized vessels. you want more defensive and offensive power? mine in a battleship/cruiser/carrier/mercnaugt/titan, nobody is stopping you from doing that. hell, put mining lasers on a rorqual and mine with that.ships that are specialized for a certain role are greatly efficent in that particular role but lacking in others for a simple reason. that's the point of specialization.besides, you're missing the point here. eve onlline is an mmo. note the second ""m"" describing ""multiplayer"". this isn't tetris or super mario karts. make some friends, have them defend you from the baddies, it'll be a rich and pleasant experience for everyone involved."
9/2/2014,"then by all means, name this doctrine ganking frigate that does 500-700 dps."
9/2/2014,"this change doesn't do anything to the pvp meta-game. pvpers want kills. they'll kill a helpless barge w/ 2 ships or 10 not-so-helpless barges with 20 ships. increasing a barge's offensive capabilities will only make a pvper more likely to engage with more people, which will just make no difference.you will not ever be able to change what the person at the keyboard is doing, and no amount of messing with non-combat ships will change that. right now, the keyboardist is bored with sov mechanics, doesn't want to dedicate time to fw and has made 20b isk doing incursions for a month. the keyboardist is creating his/her own content, to the perceived detriment of the miner. the meta has become 10 year-old bullies with nothing better to do than beat up the 1st graders playing in the sand. until that changes, we miners (and i'm proud to be a carebear) will just have to deal with it. so should you."
9/2/2014,"lmao, renters. specifically northern associates is literally the only alliance left in the game that has this policy."
9/2/2014,"what do i suggest? well, i've been suggesting it all this time. find away to nerf both, as in together, at the sametime/ectra cloaking and local together. this is why i keep suggesting intel tools, pull the omnipotent intel off of local, create real intel tools, and you know what that can create? the possability of intel tools that can hunt cloaks, without being over powered due to local giving them a heads up that there is already someone in the system, they actually have to scan the system down, buy using infomation that could be out of date (ie the map) or by going on word of mouth, and scanning each and every system that you think there is a hostile in. that the problem people continue to fail to understand, if you give someone the ability to hunt down cloaks without nerfing local, then that ability will be over powered cause you will know that he is there as soon as he enters the system, thus he would be unable to hide, ever. omnipotent intel can only be defeated by omnipotent masking. if you want to take away the omnipotent masking, then you must take away the omnipotent intel. i'm sorry, but despite what people say, that is the only way to do it... the only problem is that you must figure out away to do both at the same time so that neither side becomes to powerful."
9/2/2014,"wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong. it's like you don' even remotely know what you are talking about. if you nerfed both, cloakers would be far far far superior to as they currently are as most people hunting for pve players do not use local to do so. local is irrelevant to them as it does not tell you who is and isn't available as target. on the other hand, removing local from pve players and forcing them to use another system is forcing them to spend less time playing the game they like and more time playing with some arbitrary system just so they can avoid becoming fodder. and that's before you even consider how it would work once you have thousands of people, includign cloakers, in a system.and no, it's not the only way to do it. it's the only way someone as one track, closed minded and uninformed about null sec mechanics can think to do it, but it is certainly not the only way. i mean if the end result is scrapping afk cloakers, then the afk part could be attacked for example, preventing people being able to remain afk and cloaked for more than a set amount of time. allowing the exploration covops ships the ability to probe out cloakers would be another, and would barely affect people cloaking actively, as you can't generally catch a ship that keeps moving."
9/2/2014,"if this is your version of a respectful reply, i think you missed the mark.wow, that is simply amazing! (your claim about hunters not using local)so, if these hostile pvp players enter a system, with noone but themselves listed in local, they still begin scanning and checking probable activity areas for targets?because, we know that sov null always has full activity, so not using local to locate targets is normal behavior for them.skipping obvious and accepted details, such as noone else in local but yourself and possibly allies, in order to make an absolute statement that denies this... not rational.it's not that they use local to hunt with, but how much they truly depend on it.forcing them to spend less time playing the game they love...wait... you mean grinding asteroids or npc rats is what we have been working towards?we have not been playing eve for an opportunity to interact with other players competitively?you seem to be confusing a timesink / obstacle to play, for the intended goal these activities enable us to do, which is play with each other.we grind isk so we can get the cool ships to fly around and play with each other. while i am sure a few love the zen tranquility of mining lasers endlessly drilling into floating rocks, a screen saver can duplicate that.a likely majority do so in order to have the toys we use to play mmo's with.ranting before the end of a post adds nothing of meaningful content.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
9/2/2014,"people use stats or common knowledge to pick areas to hunt, then on arrival they scan out the system. many systems have people in them 24/7 just docked or in a pos, so local does nothing for them. when they arrive they have to scan out the system, which they can do while on the move.and they don't depend on it at all. that's why cloakers have no issue with the removal of local intel.some people enjoy pve. that's the part of the game they love. you want to take that away from them because you don't have enough easy targets to gank.it's not a rant, it's a statement of fact. you and maria look at this from a single point of view. you don't consider how it affect other mechanics and how it would affect other people."
9/2/2014,"i'm sorry, is me looking at it from a different view point then 'your's' bothering you? all i've seen you all thread is reinforce your own view point, and not only that, but also not even backing up anything you say. i've backed up what i said with quotes, and links. all i see is someone who wants as little risk to themselves as possible in their own little bubble of safety. i'm sorry for not agreeing with your view point."
9/2/2014,"no, you are looking at it from one point of view. you don;t even understand the mechanics enough to try to look at it from other points of views. you haven't considered if from perspective of people who live in null at all, let alone how it would affect large scale warfare. you've barely even looked at it from the hunter/hunted point of view.and no, you've backed up nothing. you've linked to one dev saying that he personally thinks it should be different and a handful blog posts written by idiots for en24. you have yet to show why any of your ideas would be good or how they would work if integrated into the current null environment without screwing everything up.i on the other hand have nothing to prove since i want no changes. the fact that the existing system works, has worked for years and is used every day is proof enough. the onus is on you to show that your changes won't break the game. but you are far too think to understand that, so you find it easier to ignore what people write, then scream and whine like a child."
9/2/2014,
9/3/2014,best thread ever :)this space for rent..
9/3/2014,"that is a fallacy.you are basically saying you can veto any idea, with absolutely no other foundation for your objection, except to say you dislike it.change is inevitable.it is going to happen.how it happens, is determined by a variety of sources.the status quo is not a self defending dynamic, particularly the way you present it as proof of concept for itself.an argument which seems to actually claim: it exists, so must be perfect....the current system's existence proves absolutely nothing, beyond the fact that it exists at this time.i would like you to present more than just your opinion, but i am growing concerned you can offer us nothing more.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
9/3/2014,"incorrect. i can veto the idea because it's badly thought out, has absolutely no proof that it will not cause enormous issues, and has been stated by someone who has given clear evidence that they have no experience with the mechanic, on top of the fact that the existing mechanics work perfectly well and get used every single day. it's like a medical student half way though university suggesting a new and ill through out method for performing a triple bypass while pointing at the patients stomach saying ""the heart's around there someowhere"".change in the way you think it's going to happen is not inevitable. there's every possibility that local will remain as is forever.the fact that it not only exists but that cloaks and local are used in daily activities show they work well enough. the only evidence towards the removal of local is wormhole space which is desolate. you've shown no reason to believe that changes to null in the same way wouldn't make null even worse due to fixed gates and power projection, and you haven't even fired a guess at how it would work with 4000 people in a system.i'm all for a well thought out change to be put forward, but to this date all of the ideas put forward have been thought out from one maybe 2 angles at best. there are a lot of mechanics in nullsec which will need to be considered if any change is to happen, and honestly i think it would not be worth the development time. the value it would add simply isn't there. 99% of the playerbase would gain nothing but extra clicks.lol, of course it's my opinion as what you and maria have stated is yours. at no point have i stated otherwise. my opinion is just educated with first hand experience of most null mechanics rather than being from one or two points of view with little to no consideration for how it might affect others. your opinion is not gospel purely because you have it."
9/3/2014,"i can veto the idea, because it badly thought out, is based on your opinion correct? also compairing the process new ideas are suggested based on a customer base, to how the medical base suggest no ideas does not exactly build a strong foundation on your reasoning. specially seeing the process of doing such is much different from each other. your lack of general knowledge scares me. if dev(s) are complaining about local, i some how highly doubt it will remain as is forever. how do you know that? where does this statistic come from? how do you know it will become worse? how it would work with 4000 people in the same system, well i'm sure propperly set up tools can quite easily work just like the current system if you have 4000 people in a system. i don't know why you would bring up that topic seeing most people in that large of a number tend to be in fleets, and you have this amazing tool called fleet chat. as for there is a lot of mechanics to take into considered for null sec, like what? feel free to name a few of the mechanics that would be affected in a negetive manner if local was changed to be only a chat, and didn't provide any intel at all, (aka, person only popped up if they spoke in the chat) and true intel tools are developed, thus allowing people, to gain less info if they are lazy, or more info, if they mastered the system. like how basically everything else in eve currently is. (few exceptions here and there of course.) as for just being extra clicks, how do you know that? do you magically know what the future will hold or how new intel tools would be design, do you have statics on how that will play out? where your proof? or are you once again, pulling **** out of your ass? and in my opinion, you are just another null bear that wants as much safety as possible without any of the work for said safety. as for my opinion not being gospel, well not everything i stated is opinion, infact, it a fact that only omnipotent intel can be defeated by omnipotent masking, thus if you remove the omnipotent from one, they you have to remove the omnipotent from the other, it simple game balancing fact. something you seem to refused to accept, just because you refuse to accept this fact does not make said fact untrue or an opinion. as for how it will affect others? well, i'm sure like in any change in the game, someone is going to get affected negatively, it bound to happen, not everyone agrees on things, and that is what makes people human. can't make everyone happy after all. as for the dev part of it only being one dev opinion, i do have a question for you, if it was just only one dev's opinion, why has he not been talked to about not posting, or hell, even removing his post not only on twitter, but also the forums. if was just one dev then i'm sure the other devs would of not have stand by idle while letting someone that works with them, in you know, the same office, post things that all other devs disagree with, but hey, that just my own observation."
9/3/2014,"it's simple. you haven't got a clue about most null mechanics, which not only have you evidenced, but you've all but admitted, so it's understandable that your ideas are not well thought out. you've yet to explain a single one of the other null mechanics and how they would fit it, the only thing you've looked at is how it might affect a cloaker that hunts people (which you claim not to be), and one of those cloakers has explained himself in this thread why you were wrong (which again you ignored). come back when you have half a clue what you are talking about. or in fact stick around now, because no csm member is going to champion your idea while you are displaying repeatedly that you haven't thought it through. a single dev stated his personal opinion. no devs were ""complaining"". and there are plenty of examples (which i have given) of ideas that devs have been for an against which have not gone their way. it's not a case that anything that pops into a single developers head will get put into the game eventually, development simply doesn't work that way. where does what statistic come from? that null works as is or that wormholes space is empty?and lol. most people seem to be in fleet, therefore knowing what is in the system the are attacking/defending is irrelevant eh? lol. are you trying to prove even further that you have no clue at all about null mechanics?again, lol. you mean how could sovereignty or supercapital construction work in a wormhole environment? not well you haven't considered any mechanics. you want to strip out local and you want to dump in some arbirtrary system for people to click to be able to gain the same intel, and you haven't even considered how people that actually live in null every day would react. you only look from your point a view, a passer by in null.and effort will involve clicks or keypresses. how do i know? because those are the two methods of input in eve online, and you want to add extra input to gain the same output."
9/3/2014,"grow up kid. seriously.you've posted a crappy idea that you've not thought through, and you have next to zero idea of what goes into null daily, and all of a sudden, my opinion as a null player is irrelevant?and how it affects other people is very important when those ""other people"" are 99% of the population of an entire system. your failure to understand that is just another reason why your idea is badly thought out. its a selfish idea that you want for you. it's not an idea that's good for the game.and why would the dev be told to remove his opinion? devs are allowed personal opinions. that doesn't mean that the design direction of the game will go that way, ever. some devs like loot spew and publicly stated as much, yet loot spew is gone. you hang onto it so much because it;s the only shred of support you've seen for the idea. so since the introduction of immediate local, one single dev has voiced his support for it, and we are 30 pages into an assembly hall thread and no csm has come in supporting your idea to kill nullsec. this isn't even the first thread asking for this idea, and still, no support.so one comment coming up on 2 years old is supposed to be evidence that local has a limited shelflife? you're hoping pretty hard on that one kiddo."
9/3/2014,"lets do a check list here. a: called him out for his stupid comparision to medical community way of suggesting ideas, and a gaming community to suggesting ideas.quickly changes tactics saying i don't have a clue about null mechanics. (check) b: still going on about a single dev opinion, still ignores the fact that if it was only a single dev's opinion, then he would of most likely been told not to post things like that again, which not only has he posted on twitter, which right in the same twitter comments, the other person stated another dev has talked about it during alliance tournaments, so we have two confirmed devs, and, the possibility of other devs agreeing because they havn't been told to stop talking about it. also, ignores the fact that dev, or developers opinions greatly matter when it comes to the subject of change because they are the ones that... you know, come up with concepts, artwork, sounds, write the code for such change, and ectra. c: makes claims that wormhole space is empty, and thus reason for not providing change. however, the recent expansion quickly disproves this theory as if it never used, why further expand upon it? d: makes another claim about me not taking into account of other mechanics with this brand spanking new mysterious idea that i never posted. continues to place post ****, and provides no backing facts or stats on this idea that i posted(not don't know what seeing i have yet to post an idea) that this idea would increase current clicking and button pressing. e: calls me a kid, despite the fact that i have done my utmost best to respect him as an adult, he doesn't seem to want to return the favor.f: again, attacks an idea that i have never posted. i want to know what this idea he droning on about. g: makes another 99% of the population of an entire system, again, i would like to know where he gets these stats from. please, links? a table? a chart? some data?h: sure, devs are allowed to opinions, however, when being a developer means you have more power, it also means that the gaming community will hold your word at a higher standard then some random person that is posting on their forums."
9/3/2014,anyone know if it is possible to ban someone from a thread? no? well ok then.
9/3/2014,"ok a few things to shoot from the hip, some of these ideas come from this thread, some from others, and some from in game discussion. proposed changes - these are ideas not complete proposals. we make these assumptions. stations and gates are connected. regardless of space sec.other than where specified - actively cloaked ships are not reported.pilot aggression status unless specified is not reported. 1. local take the form of other system channels where it only shows those who choose to speak2. the auto scan system already in place, scan times to be set by pilot. shows in tab - (keep in mind some things will be described later) a. hi sec - black box reports to ded and concord record of pilots in system, sec status, aggression status. ship class. ship board computer populates standings as set by pilot. b. low sec - black box reports to ded and concord record of pilots in space, sec status, shipboard computer populates standings as set by pilot. c. null sec - npc space black box reports to ded only record of ship class, and corporation of pilots in system. shipboard computer populates standings as set by pilot. if an ess is deployed information as if in low sec is reported to the corp/alliance/standings as set by deploying pilot. d. null sec - sov space - black box ded reports to ded record of ship class in space and corporation of pilots in system.shipboard computer populates standings as set by pilot. sentry reports for sov holders. if an ess is deployed information as if in low sec is reported to the corp/alliance/standings as set by deploying pilot. for non sov holders, only ship class is reported. unless a gate sentry is deployed. wormhole space will stay the same. new deployable modules and ship modules. gate sentry - only deployable in sov space - tied to gate is it anchored on. only anchorable within 15k of a gate. give reports of all pilots who use the gate, or comes in range of gate to corp/alliance/standings as set by deploying pilot. if multiple gates in system multiple sentries need to be deployed. us usable by both sov holders and non sov holders, so it can spy on you. (i have not found a viable interface for this)gate sentry decoy - can be deployed by hostile to jam gate sentries. also works as a regular gate sentry for deploying pilot. active cloak detection array - this is a deployable that must be part of the pos system. it anchors similar to a gun or jump beacon. senses ship emissions and emits variable bands of energy to detect cloaked vessels. (personally i would prefer this be a deployable connected with a combat probe scanner)modulessignature decoy - dependant on skills, fits a hi slot, emits ship emission and alters ded concord signal to broadcast a ship type of the blue print copy loaded - each cycle uses on run.signature scanner - dependant on skills, fits in hi slot, direct counter to signatur decoy - processes reports and compares to sensor array to determine validity of reported data. this is the main idea, take several of the good ideas suggested, along with other things that are already in the works by ccp. incorporate them to change things to make more challenging game play."
9/3/2014,"here a few suggestions of my own. a: give the ability to disable being watched. that way you can set it up so that people can't watch you to know what times you are on at. b: real intel tools instead of a ""black box."" the ability to scan a general direction of what ships are by clicking scan, then having a little cone that points in that general direction, have the system set up though that signature of the ship, the harder it is for that compus to ""lock on."" thus the cone gets wider. c: set up an ability for fully customize-able scan with something like the d-scanner, better filtration controls. those are just three very small suggestions to add as my own."
9/4/2014,+1 my mother got pregnant because of this.
9/4/2014,"i have not considered the watch list - that is an interesting idea, however there needs to be a major trade off. consider block warfare - hi sec warfare, hi sec ganking. watchlist is invaluable to entities that do not have the power projection, defenses, of larger entities.watchlist gives them idea of impending danger to take appropriate steps. currently watchlist does not tell you what system a pilot is in or if they are active or not. logging in all super pilots has changed fleet objectives - in both directions logging in as a war target has caused disruption ect. what would be the trade to have the ability to remove your activity from watchlist? your suggestions to changes to d scan are acceptable and is along the same lines as the detailed idea of scanner improvements not mentioned in the above post. thank you for your valuable input."
9/4/2014,"a. the comparison was sound. you don't know anything about null, so while you think your idea is amazing, people with actual knowledge of null can see that it's dumb. in exactly the same way as any other subject, including medicine, a newbie with great ideas isn't the person you should be listening to about the validity of those ideas.b. you are truly insane. you think that is one dev has an opinion the company is going to come crashing down and tell them they are not allowed to voice their own opinions? what reality do you live in where a development company would stifle a developers rights to freedom of speech like that? the fact that it was 2 years ago and there's still no changes years and years after the introduction of local intel, that speaks volumes louder.c. wormhole space is relatively empty. in comparison with the other space, it's the least used space. and why expand it? for exactly the same reason. it's not very well used so they are trying to improve it to encourage more people to use it.d. you've voice your idea clearly many times. the nuking of local and replacing it with an effort based mechanic. where are the specifics? who rightly knows. your idea has not be thought out well enough to have any.e. total and utter bull. from the getgo you've attacked me rather than the argument and refused to take on board any level of criticism. i'm not even the first person in the thread to point this out, another person who disagreed with you was trolled and attacked. you've set up a troll alt to troll and you are getting upset when called out on it.f. so you've not suggested replacing local? why are you arguing so hard for it then?g. i'm saying that you haven't taken on board 99% of the population. the number of people who hunt in cloakers and that's all is very very very small. since that's the only perspective you are looking at, to say you've not looked at it for 99% of the people's points of view is being generous.h. and that still does not mean that their opinions will come to pass. the suggestion that the change is inevitable because one developer is in support of it is ludicrous."
9/4/2014,"this change is quite one sided. most null groups couldn't care less who the individual pilot is, all they care about is the colour of their tag, so for sov holding groups this would barely have an impact. for non-sov holders though, it would mean that they can't find the basic information they need to assault a system. basically you would be giving defending sov holders an intel advantage as well as all of the other advantages they have. i'm in a large enough group that it wouldn't really matter to me, but smaller null groups would take this change hard.what is the benefit of the idea? a lot of the resistance to these ideas has always been that the ideas aren't there for a gameplay benefit, they are just there because certain people think that local intel should only be obtained through input. combining these ideas together in one megathread doesn't suddenly add purpose, so to many people these ideas will still come across as ""more clicking for the sake of clicking"" rather than being designed to fulfill a gameplay need of a given group.if the idea is to remove afk cloakers, then keep it simple. stop people being able to go afk without getting logged out, and tada, problem solved.on a side note, why is this in assembly hall? this isn't a proposal for a csm to back, it's just another f&i discussion thread that's not in f&i, probably so it can avoid being noticed by as many members of the community."
9/4/2014,"for my input...for the watch list, the game already has a built in mechanism, if we do it right.only allow tracking by players with a green or blue standing.if we learned anything from eve, we know that spies are present. a spy that only reports intel, and takes no action to otherwise reveal themselves, is part of the traditional meta game.you can track your enemies, by having spies report that data. the effort made to cultivate these agents, and the human limitations of their reporting ability with delays and possible errors... this is what we want from eve.the effort at every step has meaning, and is not replaced by a flawless automated reporting system.as for d-scan, i have created a proposal that may solve this.i believe the cycle time for it should consider range, both in distance and whether it is limited to only a narrow directional cone."
9/4/2014,"nikk thank you for putting the link, the d-scan related ideas came from your post. in addition what do you think about the deployables? i would really value your input on those. the modules have been talked about in several places. i have not put details to them either. also when i put my finished proposal together for the intel package, i plan to reference your threads related to it."
9/4/2014,"i have my own version of deployables, for consideration.originally posted november 5th, 2013, as a response in a long thread of other items.have local operate in degrees of quality.give it two dimensions for this as well.dimension one, quantity of intel.dimension two, quality of intel.dimension one, would give ship numbers, then types, finally pilot names.dimension two, would give presence of neutrals, reduce delay to zero, then give presence of cloaked vessels.dimension one structures, which would be harder targets, would be pos add ons.dimension two structures, which would be easier targets meant for roams or smaller gangs, would be only in open space away from overview beacon items. these would need to be scanned down.examples:dimension 1: level 3dimension 2: level 3full list of pilot names, with faction tag visible.ship type listed next to name, highlighted if cloaking active.dimension 1: level 3dimension 2: level 0full list of pilot names, with ship type next to name.no faction standings listed, not defining cloak status.all updates delayed by 30 to 60 seconds, (balance adjusting by devs)dimension 1: level 1dimension 2: level 3no pilot names.4 numbers listed. 1st number is how many friendly pilots (2nd is how many are cloaked)3rd number is how many neutral or hostile (4th is how many are cloaked)and for the curious, here is the actual for the 0-3 combo.(this tactical setup could be anchored on relatively short notice, and has no strategic side as the above do)dimension 1: level 0dimension 2: level 3a single light indicatornot lit if no other pilots presentgreen light lit if all friendlyyellow light lit if hostiles presentred light lit if hostile cloaked presenti figure this eliminates any need for hunting cloaked ships specifically, although that can be sorted into if the devs see balanced opportunity.if done carefully, it can actually be effective, and a good support for everyone having a great game play experience.the two dimensional system has one side for sov level support, only truly threatened by massive blob warfare, which only offers mass level intel.the other side is for pilot level, whether operating solo or in small groups. the intel is more detailed, as well as quicker to install or destroy, depending on your perspective.both benefit strongly when the other side is present.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."

9/5/2014,"i'd like to propose:1) any titan that bridges a ship/fleet must jump with the vessels to the destination as a fleet, and the ability to bridge the fleet alone be removed.2) when a titan and its fleet lands, the ships will land around the titan in the same relative position to the titan, as it was at the time of the the fleet jump. the sun would be used as a point of reference relative to the titan prior to jumping and the location of the cyno for landing (allowing for fleets to form up prior to the jump)3) ships could be up to 25km from the titan prior to jumping."
9/5/2014,"surely this completely and totally prevents smaller alliances from ever using any kind of a titan bridge?you're not going to see, for example, rooks and kings pipebombing a cfc fleet if they lose a titan every time."
9/5/2014,"what do i trade to give up watch-list, well of course, i would give up watch list itself. losing watch-list means that the aggressive entity also loses the ability to keep track of when the defensive entity. so watch-list in this case is it own balancer. again, i'm attempting to provide a feed back, that i don't care if a change is put through or not, i'm simply stating that if a change has to be made, then far many more steps must be added then just adding a tool that gives defensive entity to hunt afk cloakers, as with the many above arguments. cloaking and, in some cases, hot dropping(which is a semi-stretch, seeing local is reporting the hot dropper) is the only balancing factor to local's omni-potent always reporting intel."
9/5/2014,"you've always gotta love the ""my payment is the same. the fact that i lose the same mechanic, which i never use, is payment enough, right?"" you're opting to remove something which you don't care about losing and comparing that to the loss of it to someone that uses it a lot. so once again we fall back to you making suggestions for gameplay changes to gameplay you are not part of. incorrect. cloaking is a mechanics designed to be used strategically with other mechanics. it has absolutely nothing to do with local intel. people like you continue to say ""afk cloaking was invented in response to local"", but prove it. prove that's the case. to suggest that suggests that a. people think you can catch ships with a covops ship and that is their intended purpose, and b. when faced with the inability to catch ships in a covops ship they resort to sitting a character there and leaving, which does not allow them to catch anything.afk cloaking was a designed as a low effort resource denial tactic against entities with a set home, nothing more. other than providing the method by which the target sees the cloaker, local had nothing to do with it. if you were unable to go afk without getting logged out, it would force people to have to actively cloak to have the same effect. if people want to do that, that should be perfectly viable, but they should have to actually do it, not just sit their pc doing it while they sleep.and the thing is, a lot of this comes back to the ability to hunt a cloaked pilot as a ""cost"" for them being able to not be on intel, but like above that's not a ""cost"" since an actively piloted frigate getting scanned down takes some serious terribad playing on the side of the pilot. an active cloaker would still be untouchable (and rightly so) by keeping on the move just like any other frigate is, just with the added benefit of still being totally invisible when on grid with targets."
9/5/2014,"i love how lucas glosses over details, particularly when devs have repeatedly pointed out they cannot predict emergent gameplay.the whole bit about implying how afk cloaking was intended by devs... priceless.i like how it is implied in the past that devs planned local to include faction standings, rather than giving it to everyone as a reaction to a third party app that one group had developed.because, you know, they can see the future, and know how everything will be used.which wildly conflicts with any dev commenting otherwise, of course.the last part, which acknowledges the stalemate existing, but implies that this is intended rather than emergent... just wow.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
9/5/2014,"was this deliberately ironic? please point out where i stated that devs designed afk cloaking... i merely pointed out that afk cloaking was created to deny resources to enemies over a long time period with minimal effort, not by teary eyed cloaked hunters that couldn't catch ratters like you continue to bleat.when it was originally designed it wasn't. when it was later redesigned it quite obviously was designed to show standings. or are you saying that the standing icons on local chat are an elaborate bug that's slipped though undetected all these years?most devs haven't commented on it at all. how do you even remotely get the idea that because one dev has stated his personal preference, and that's all, that the designed and implemented features of the game are not there by design? simple question: was immediate local programmed into the game, or is it a a weird bug that ccp are unable to remove (even though they removed it in wormholes)? i can't catch awake and actively piloted frigates in a battleship either, so i guess that needs to change.i'll say it again: a covert ops ship is not an interceptor. clear enough? stop trying to use it for that purpose then crying when it doesn't work.and finally, that ""last part"" was actually pointing out that active cloakers would be completely unaffected by adding the ability to scan them down, since non-covops frigates are also impossible to scan down if they are active and have an iq above 7. so it was pointing out that you saying ""remove local, and the cloakers will pay the price by being scannable!"" is a totally once sided change, since the ""price"" is irrelevant to anyone except the afk.you need to learn to read my friend."
9/6/2014,"well. all i can say everyday i see tones of isboxers and their number strogly increasing. and they go pvp, they have so many isks so they can do what they want, and normal players losing ships to them in pvp even with much more better skills by beeing overnumbered. it's not fair, it will ruin game, ruining it's balance. maybe ccp will get more money but soon they will loose much more when ppl will leave this game cos players will not play game where cheating is allowed officially."
9/6/2014,"i have often wondered why miners are restricted to gallente mining class vessels.i propose that 3 additional ships should be added to provide variety and attract more industrial folk into the game.minmatar mining bargethis is concept art of what a minmatar barge could look like. it is essentially an old rusted steel girder with an engine and lazors.amarr mining bargethis is concept art of what a amarr barge could look like. the t2 variant could be black perhaps and be khanid.caldari mining bargeand finally here is concept art for a caldari barge. i found a use for this otherwise useless hull.if there were racial mining barges this could lead on to pirate faction mining barges, such as mordus angels. mordus angels mining bargeplease discuss my proposal."
9/6/2014,-
9/6/2014,three things...1. mining barges are not gallente. they are of gallente origin... but they are their own separate faction with separate ship skills. no racial pre-requisites are needed.2. a long time ago each race used to have a racial mining frigate and cruiser. when the separate ore line came along the racial cruisers fell out of favor (and the mining frigates were never very useful past one week). eventually the racial ships were repurposed into t1 logi ships.3. why?
9/6/2014,why not just have one faction of cruisers?
9/6/2014,"because each faction has different traits and tactics that sets it apart from the others. mining, on the other hand, is tactically two dimensional. you mine... and either you tank whatever threat presents itself... or you run away.besides... this would undo the changes that were made to de-racialize mining... which was a common complaint back in the day.now answer the question: why?"
9/6/2014,just more variety i guess. each race could be stronger at using specific crystals. ice for example is race specific isn't it?
9/6/2014,"i like the idea of the fairly new high sec war mechanics, but they just do not work as intended.firstly corps and alliances such as marmite, forsaken, everyone vs everyone etc make a joke of ccps intention of making war more meaningful because they mass ""dec"" all of high sec. how can a war be mean anything if most war decing corps dont even check who they are decing and simply dec 3/4/5/6 corps a day (in some cases)* the cost of a war is nothing to 95% of a single eve people, nevermind a corp or alliance.* the mechanics support mass decs* the mechanics suppress new corps and force many new players out of the game because they get hammerd constantly by mass dec corps/alliances and thats no fun sitting in a station all day or getting killed constantly with no chance to win.* the mechanics suppress mercenary corps because it encourages mass touting as an ally, without ever turning up for the war or even speaking with the corp you offer to support (for isk)* the mechanics encourage griefing because there are few limits on decing.* the mechanics encourage the 0-0 draw wars, it cost so little to dec you can just dec 20 corps and not turn up for most of them and simply camp all day at a trade hub.* having played this game since 2005, i have seen how the changes have affected the game over time, gone are the days a new corp can form and thrive, build up and move to 0.0 as part of an alliance they join or create. now there deced within days of creation and destroyed before they get a chance, im not saying this didnt happen before, but its alot more common now. i get survival of the fittest, but the conveyor belt to 0.0 is getting weaker by the day. high sec wars have always been, and can be the making of a corp, but constant decs without anytime to recover is simply a mechanic to remove people from this game completly. if its not fun why should they stay.in my opinion new mechanics need change the system.*design some kind of limit or much higher cost to multiple decs.*perhaps a corp can become undecable for 1 week after a war if the war is not extended. to everyone, 2 weeks to everyone if surrenderd.*new corps can not dec or be deced for 1 month after creation, unless they join an alliance?* insert other ideas here!i understand this is a sandbox, you dont want to set alot of rules and restrictions, that you want the users to create the content. but this is a core foundation of the entire game, high sec is the start for everyone and the support for low sec, 0.0 and wh. the mechanics in place strangle new players and corps, so perhaps some of the above ideas can be implemented in such a way as to not appear limiting, some kind of narrative reason why or made up bs reason why there are limits but however its put in the game it needs to be there. this is not something to think about for along time, i really think this is something that needs to be a prioritythanks."
9/6/2014,"it costs a minimum of 50 million isk per war dec (which doubles for each week it is active). if someone is willing to spend 5+ billion isk on 100+ war decs then raising the cost of declaring war isn't going to stop them.plus, you can always bypass exponential costs by declaring war on different corporations with ""shell"" (see: ""empty"") corporations and then the aggressors jumping between the corps.and you can't put meaningful restrictions on the war deccers' ability to do that because it will then affect the ability for defenders to jump corp and avoid wars (because they use the same mechanics).exploit found: have your alt in a ""shell"" corporation declare war on your industrial corporation. surrender to your alt. you are now immune to war decs for 2 weeks. rinse and repeat.this is basically ""dec shield 3.0""after a month, drop corp and reform it. you are now immune to war decs for a month. rinse and repeat.oh? such corps can only be made by newbie characters? roll a new alt character (either on the same account or on a trial) and train up the basic skills to make another corp (it only costs an hour of your life and a small bit of isk). er no... high-sec is like any other area of the game. the difference is that aggression comes at a cost (either in the form of war decs or ship loss to concord). yeah, you have some starter areas... and there are some special rules in place for those specific systems... but eve is eve. you can evade pvp, sure... but you cannot (and should not be able to) avoid the threat of it.and being a newbie is no excuse. with the right mentoring and back-up, a newbie (or bunch of them) can be quite dangerous. goonswarm proved this. some of the newbies i see joining fw prove this. a guy i am mentoring proves this.""winning"" at eve has more to do with mentality than anything else."
9/6/2014,"ok great, i dont have a problem with anyone finding exploits in those ideas. so come up with something yourself! anyone can find problems but not everyone can offer solutions. no it is not, each part of eve has its own rules and is slightly or alot different then other parts. but high sec is the only place every eve player will visit and is the place where everyone will spend at least a portion of there time.the problem remains and you offer no solution, some corps and alliances are mass decing high sec and killing off new corps before they get a foothold in the game. the ally system is harming merc corps because you can just ally with everyone for very small amount of isk and not bother with the war. the original concept ccp had for the new war dec system was more meaningful wars. wars over something, not 30/40 decs on at a time, mass decing all of high sec then camping the jita gates.does anyone have ideas to bring more control to the amount of decs you can have at any one time, that is natural, leaves the choice in the players hands and fits into the idea of meaningful wars??"
9/6/2014,"i offer no solution because i do not see a problem.edit: also... just because you see some wars as ""meaningless"" it doesn't mean that the other people will see it the same way. for me, killing people ""just because"" is a perfectly legitimate reason."

9/7/2014,"well there was those guys in gents awhile back that boxed 20-odd supers between them & can be attributed to causing an alliance to lose their space, but they burned out because multiboxing like that is a level of effort that only the most insane could handle longterm."
9/7/2014,"honestly, this is why i haven't gotten into it. i just can't be arsed to figure it out, set up all my clients exactly perfectly so that the multiboxing will work, and all the other crap that goes into it. eve is a game, not a job, and that seems a lot like work to me.eve is a multi player game. and you are the content. - ralph king-griffin being meh at two things is not better than being great at one. - lugh crow-slave"

9/7/2014,"ok we get it, your a bad ass uber killer who doesnt give a f***. the problem you fail to see or understand, i dont care personaly why someone dec's somebody else. i care that they can dec as many corps/alliances as there bloated wallets let them. and the effects of this mass decing have on eve and high sec. if you dont see an issue with it then there is no need to reply to this at all.contrary to what was said earlier, i think a much higher cost to war would reduce the mass dec problem, it might even make them take some care as to who they dec. if you x4 the current cost, i dont care how rich you are you wont want to lose 10/15/20b a week on wars you dont even try and fight, the countless 0-0 draw wars. it would force them to consider the dec's more carefuly, it would also help protect smaller and newer corps because they would be less likly to spend 200m on some 20 man bunch of noobs when its unlikly they will see any action or return on it.if anyone has better ideas, by all means share them. but there is certainly a problem a problem and it certainly does not match what ccp said they wanted from this new war dec system.just saying."

9/8/2014,very excited to see what asayanami brings to the table and that corbexx has a new tag partner. sorry to see matias go but he clearly didn't have the time/energy for csm.

9/8/2014,"as we have seen with matias (and others in the past) sometimes the life of a delegate just excludes them from participating fully in the csm process. replacing them with the first runner up is an excellent way to encourage future csm candidates to up their game in the elections, and work hard when awarded a seat, which can only lead to a better csm for you all. i certainly am looking forward to welcoming asayanami to this csm."

9/8/2014,"the op thinks that exercising of player freedom is a problem.fortunately, despite whatever lie he might want to spout about ccp's ""intent"", the truth is pretty far away from that.there is no problem here."
9/8/2014,"5b is pocket change for most people. a wardec group has no issue keeping that up. 100+ wars is ridiculous to be honest. personally i'd increase it 10 fold and/or put a hard limit on how many wars you can be involved in as an aggressor.the problem with wardecs is that all they are is a means to pay off concord to not intervene. they tried to fix that by adding the whole merc system, but all that did was open a pathway for scammers while still not making wardecs actually mean anything."
9/8/2014,"which then puts wars firmly out of reach for younger-poorer players while doing nothing to stop older-richer players from continuing on as usual.and a hard limit on war decs is easily circumvented by having a ""shell"" corporations declare war and just moving back and forth between them.and making it so that players of an aggressing corp cannot leave it until a war has ended will create a situation where no one will be able to leave a corp if the defender makes the war mutual and refuses any surrender request.wars mean exactly what a player wants them to mean. it is all about perspective.you may not see any point or meaning to a war... the other side may feel their reasons for declaring war are perfectly fine. there is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" answer."
9/8/2014,incoming war decs on op.
9/8/2014,"it does, but they wouldn't be able to have so many simultaneous wars. if they did want more than the limit at any one time, they would need to split up for the actual wars. you can;t be in 2 corps.a simple short time limit on leaving an aggressing corp would prevent that.well yes and no. the vast majority of wars are used to bypass concord and generate thousands of legal targets to farm.of course not, but most people have no reason beyond ""easy targets, no concord"". the few groups that are legitimately fighting with each other for a real reason would have no problems with a limit to the number of outgoing wars even if it were as low as 10 for example, because very few people have genuine grudges againt that many people all at once."
9/8/2014,"and? if people are willing to put themselves in a position where dozens, upon dozens of people can attack them at all hours of the day anywhere in the map... let them.the ""targets"" can organize themselves and shoot back you know. they just choose not to.you obviously don't play the way i do. if people don't have a grudge against me in the first place, they soon will."

9/9/2014,"well, i use a mac, so lol and also no is boxer for mesomehow i seem to manage just fine using apple's built in tools to send keystrokes to multiple programs as well as having enough monitors to see all my clients simultaneously.i do use a repeater, but if it is part of the core os - is it 3rd party? osx and eve client, that is 2 partiesmac pro - dual quad xeons, 64gb ram, 6 monitors - 18 clients - no problem - no 3rd party software, all done via applescript and tools that come as part of osx"
9/9/2014,rekt
9/9/2014,if ccp bans isboxer then they also need to ban use usage of mac clients. get rekt.
9/9/2014,"i think a lot of people, myself included, would be pretty pissed off if they got to doing something like that before fixing balance issues, gameplay issues, bugs, etc."
9/9/2014,"hello fellow capsuleers. i wanted to take the time to apologize personally. i've decided to resign from the csm rather than let my seat go to waste. it was a difficult decision, as i felt that i could at least have spent some of my energy on the all-important issue of new player attraction and retention, but in the end i had to admit to myself that it wasn't going to happen. it appears i have made a catastrophic miss-judgement of my own ability to juggle the csm's extensive responsibilities with finishing a degree and working to pay the bills. in hindsight, seeking csm election at such a point in my life was not my brightest idea. i overreached, and to those of you that entrusted me with the responsibility to represent your vote, i am truly sorry.i won't be seeing many of you in a while, as i get my things in order and achieve the things i have reason to value in life, but a bit down the line, when things calm down a bit, maybe during some holiday, you might find me behind some forgotten gate attempting amazing things with a brave crew. because you can never really quit eve. there is nothing quite like it. you just go on a break.love,matias"

9/9/2014,"via con diosand eve is always here, waiting behind said gate for you to come backmscary, actually"
9/9/2014,"i 100% want this., this in it self would curb force projection and bring many many titans out of the safety of the pos. and we all know what happens when things like that come out of pos shields. they would also mean fleets that want to travel far to get in on a fight will have to think about do they go fast and bridge all the way risking the titan or take the gates. oh look now we have the chance to blockade a route. now we have the chance of having the ""300 hot gates"". i have been asking for this for a very long time. make it so"
9/9/2014,lol yes
9/9/2014,"actually, the bigger groups would just risk the titan. when you are jumping 1000 megas into a system to blot out the sun, a single titan jumping in then back out is hardly going to be a worry. smaller groups though with just a couple of titans, they would no longer be able to hit us.so agreed, let's have this. more power to the blobs!"
9/9/2014,small group are a serious threat to nullsec. please make this so ccp as we require a mechanic to be changed to protect us from this scourge.
9/9/2014,"to put it short - there needs to be a third option in the corporation hangar section of the roles window (currently 'query' and 'take') to allow people to do manufacturing/invention without allowing said person being able to take stuff out of said corp hangar at a station. or a rejig of the roles for station based corporation hangars.alternatively, allow for the lockdown of all items in corporation hangars. this would mean some lockdown ui changes to be made as well as the mechanics of it. alright, that sounds weird. time to put the long post in.so currently, there are 'query' and 'take' for corporation hangar access permissions. i will go over them in the context of indy/science :query - allows the user to use the blueprint for copying/time/material efficiency research only. if it has a material component, you can't do it.take - needs query too. allows the user to do everything with a blueprint. but now they have access to everything in the corp hangar. trust is a fickle thing. i want the middle ground between these two; the ability for people to use the bpos, bpcs and the prerequisite materials without being able to actually move them into their own personal hangar or to any other hangar of the corporation. i don't know if ccp look over these or not, but i feel that considering the crius' industry changes, this would facilitate the changes on a corporation level and be beneficial for all who do such activities in groups."
9/9/2014,that would be very useful to be able to outsource production jobs. i think it would greatly improve industry at a corp level. the blueprint locking mechanic is honestly awful especially now that jobs at a pos can't be run from a station hangar.
9/9/2014,"i haven't messed with the new indy ui since crius but if it is anything like the old one, having a separate ""get from"" and ""deliver"" for both the bpo/c and minerals/ship/module would be great. just get the bpo from the corp hangar and then deliver it right back when the job is done.honor is a fools prize. [i]glory is of no use to the dead.[/i] be a man! post with your main! ~vas'avi community manager"
9/9/2014,op: i like this. do you want the output to remain fixed to hanger you specify (essentially you are allowing a corp mate to loan you his indy slots) or flexible enough to be redirected as the users wishes (they can build themselves a hull from corp resources and have it land in their laps)?that all said - is this bypassing indy risk that ccp wants to maintain?
9/9/2014,"you'll want to test this, but i believe you are able to prevent corp members from adding or removing items from a pos structure through the management menu at the pos for each individual structure. interestingly they'll still be able to view these items. so in theory you could set your equipment factory to allow folks to put mats into it but not take out at the structure level, while giving them give/take other at the corp level. give this a test and let me know if it works :o) the downside remains that you still can't protect yourself from an internal attack that comes in the form of someone installing and then cancelling a ton of jobs, eradicating your mats stock. depending on the project that can get pretty expensive."
9/9/2014,"if its built in corp hangars, the scope of the output should be corp, as it seemingly is right now. not at all, you would still have to move blue prints around and draw money from a corp wallet to start jobs. this is simply fixing up a flaw that gives more power to players running industrial operations. if you can lockdown blueprints, why not items? although i prefer to go with a third form of access."
9/9/2014,"this i haven't tested, but the roles are there to facilitate it iirc. to reiterate op, this is for station based researching, where such roles do not exist. i almost misintepreted your quote as i was typing. for the uninitiated, only directors or the job maker can cancel jobs. you are referring to the job maker cancelling his own jobs, something i haven't thought of. out of scope of the op, but good advice. :)"
9/9/2014,"yeah, my bad here. assumed you were talking about pos's. there aren't any similar protective mechanisms for stations :o("
9/9/2014,simple solution is to allow corp members to make stuff from materials in the personal hanger array. problem solved.but yeah. corp and pos roles need a complete overhaul.

9/9/2014,"did he jump or was he pushed? he was barely engaged with the election process, i can imagine he was at best an absentee member, which can't have gone down well with everyone doing all the work.i'm glad that he's realised its a serious position and i hope his replacement performs well."
9/9/2014,now we can really say that the csm is an adhoc group of people!congratulations buddy! now get out there and work hard for everyone (but especially wormholers).inappropriate signature added. ccp notarealdev.
9/9/2014,glad to see another wormholer on the csm. even more excited that he will be at the summer summit.
9/9/2014,"well, this is overwhelming... hi!all i can say is i'll try my best :)"
9/9/2014,"good call matias & the rest of csm9; congratz asayanami! can you elaborate on that? since we have an stv system, all candidates that got in the csm have the same votes and those who did not have zero (.. left, after elimination etc).did you run the stv process again without him to come up with asayanami?please don't take this as tinfoil or so :) as someone who's interested in the csm process i'm mostly just curious how you determined the successor.oh, and a bit off topic but a nitpick of mine:while i would even argue that player actions are part of ""real life"" (because the players are real) and try to avoid the term, i have come to tolerate it.. but isn't the csm a customer focus group and shareholder of a gaming company? how is that not ""real life""?i do get the meaning, and of course everyone has a different priorisation (like e.g. family>some friends>job>other friends>chessclub chairmanship). but the term ""real life"" has this connotation that everything else must be less important, because it isn't real. i call shenanigans. e.g. eve is clearly more important to me than people dying in congo, as i spent x time and y money on the former and pretty much 0 time&money on the later. and it's not ""just"" a game, it's a part-time i enjoy, a community i am part of and an anchor of friendships&contacts.and for some, spending considerable time on the csm very likely takes priority over some other ""real life"" things. or plain ""other things"". those priorities change of course, as everything in life can change. so no reason to critize matias, but also no reason to diminish the relevance eve or the csm in general by stamping it ""not real""./ rant over i guess.. sorry!"
9/9/2014,"tinfoil is appropriate. however asayanami was the last candiate to be excluded, my calculations said by 80 votes. at the last round of cuttoff:mangala solaris has 1550 votesmajor jsilva has 1474 votesasayanami deihas has 1395 votesthere were 2 candidates left to fill and asayanami was cut.for the truly voting tragic, i wrote up about this at 2014/05/csm-9-election-review-of-vote.html"
9/9/2014,"all the best to matias, and welcome aboard asayamami!"
9/9/2014,"no. we didn't want to complicate the process as we wanted to get asayanami on board as fast as possible. it takes some time to get into the team and as we have summer summit coming soon i decided that this will be the best way to get a new member in, for now, if such thing happens in the future we will make sure that we are ready for it. any feedback and ideas regarding this topic will be appreciated of course <3"
9/9/2014,congrats asay!i'm really happy for you - i hope it's all you want it to be!
9/9/2014,congrats!!
9/9/2014,"congratulations, and good luck"
9/9/2014,"well, i actually figured out how to run the stv with the official ballots but with matias flagged as ""withdrawn"" and i get the same - the current csm9 with asayanami. so there's that :)fun fact, in that constellation awoxing pizza-spymaster mcblushooter was eliminated last (thanks to all those new propagated brave votes).i used the stv code from here and the ballot from here.mind, i'm not sure if that is the best way to go actually. in fact, i could see a rerun minus a resigned member causing someone else to drop aswell if the resignees votes give two candidates a big boost. you'd have to decide between one of those two... somehow, ideally based on a set rule. not as simple as it looks at first glance."
9/9/2014,"matias may be the hero we deserve, but the one we don't need right now. so we'll prod asayanami to push fixing hyperion wormhole breaking...because he can take it. because he's not our hero. he's a silent guardian, a watchful protector. a dark u-boat."
9/9/2014,delighted to see asay on the csm. hopefully the lack of uboat videos will be balanced by more wh stuffgo asay
9/9/2014,"this is great news for everyone and excellent news for wormholers. matias was taking up a valuable position and i'm glad that, however this went down, it was resolved.matias is a good guy with good intentions, but there's no point in having a position on the csm taken up by someone who isn't going to make good use of it to better eve."
9/9/2014,please keep corporation bookmarks
9/9/2014,"i personally voted for you, i hope you and corbexx can do a world of good for the wh community, and others ofc ;)"
9/9/2014,well i guess the new guy can't be any worse than an absent member that - from an outside perspective - did not do very much.
9/9/2014,"this means that wormholes are now more proportionately overrepresented than nullsec in the csm'heh' ""it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths."" - abrazzar"
9/9/2014,but still ******.congrats asayanami dei!
9/9/2014,"that's what it's for.""real reason"". pft.this is a sandbox. any reason is a real reason, whether that reason is for kills, ransom, or because i don't like their corp name."
9/9/2014,"so the wars become meaningless. you can't have it both ways. if people are able to use wardecs simply as a mechanic to disable concord, then the wars become meaningless.and no, those people can't shoot back. they are specifically targeted because they can't shoot back. if they could, they wouldn;t be targetted. and i know, i know, cue the massive walls of text explaining how everyone can learn and blah blah blah i've heard it all before. but it's all horseshit. you know how these wardec groups work, and you know that the average player stands no chance against them.no, it's designed for people to be able to fight for stuff and over stuff. to actually generate meaningful content between empire groups. instead it's used to save the cost of losing ships to concord when ganking. if limits were put in place people would have to be selective over who they attack, giving the whole system more meaning. clearly it doesn't work as it currently is, since people simply use npc characters for anything remotely important. you know what i meant by that, so stop being difficult. and limits wouldn't stop you deccing someone because you don't like their name. it would just stop the mass wardecs."
9/9/2014,"it's designed to be a way to get around the immersion breaking, infallible magic space police, for a fee. nothing more, nothing less. no ""if"", not ""so long as"", no strings attached. to suggest otherwise is nonsense.there is no such thing as ""meaningful content"", by the way. and as for npc corps, the problem of them being too attractive is not because of wardecs. it's because there is too much carrot and not enough stick in the implementation of npc corps.there is nothing wrong with the ""mass wardecs"". if they have the money and are willing to spend it, let them."
9/9/2014,"there is something very wrong with one style of play being overpowered and supported above all others, its good to be a mass war deccer right now, that is a game imbalance pure and simple. and nothing kills a sandbox faster then someone pissing in the sand.i dont have an issue with anyone deccing multiple targets, making war for lols, **** corp names, or just because. i dont care that some guys think pvp is camping a gate from a trade hub, or if corps just want to farm people for isk, i dont care at all. its all part of the fun. what i do care about is the effects of this style of game play in its current overpowerd state has on highsec and all the knock on effects i previsiously mentioned.some sort of cap or restriction needs to be applied to make this not impossible but much harder, if 5b is pocket change to most people then lets seriously increase the war dec costs, maybe a price based on number of corps/alliances deced + numbers of members within that dec + and flat fee of some type to come up with a combined fee that increases with each week the dec continued?just ideas, maybe you have some?"
9/9/2014,"then i guess it works entirely as it should and that npc corps and corp recreation being used to avoid it is also as intended and thus there's no issue. ccp, please focus more effort on making nullsec more fun for sov holders, as clearly highsec is exactly as it should be.sure there is. people used to actually understand that but it seems as time goes on people whine more and more about how everything must remain as is as if all change is bad. there's absolutely nothing wrong with giving a system a refresh and giving it more meaning and value. the problem is people refuse to accept any changes because they automatically assume the end goal is to scrap ""the sandbox"".it's pocket change for an absolutely enormous gain. the benefit they gain vs the cost and risk they have to put into it is pretty ludicrous, so yes, i think there is an issue. just because they are ganking noobs rather than mining doesn't mean that they shouldn't need to put any effort in or think about what they are doing. if they were limited, they would have to make choices, they would have to consider their options and weigh the pros and cons. as it stands, they don't, they just attack everyone they can using the cash they get from looting those to continue to grow their wardec lists.sorry for thinking people should have to make choices rather than be handed everything on a plate for pittance."

9/10/2014,"what if the ""fleet size"" had a limit? (example 100 ships)"
9/10/2014,then you limit the ability for anyone not in a major bloc to ever use a titan bridge even more...
9/10/2014,"we'd still jump multiple fleets. titan jumps to empty system with 100, then back alone, then back with the next hundred, etc. or two at a time, or whatever really. the difference is we still have an enormous backlog of titans, so the larger blobs like us and nc would not suddenly stop projecting because it was more tedious to do. we'd minimise the risk of losing a titan, and if we did lose a couple it wouldn't be the end of the world. the groups with a couple of titans they use to get about though, they would be completely crippled.i think you need to consider what impact it is you are trying to achieve with this change and see if that impact is achievable in any other way."
9/10/2014,there are two goals of this proposal:1) to get titans out of pos shields. (it is sad when a password has to be used to get a kill)2) to make them more vulnerable as they project an entities forces.thanks for the feedback/discussion.
9/10/2014,"hmmm, then the issues may be unavoidable. the problem is always going to be that smaller groups would be unable to cope with a loss of a titan as well as a larger group, so forcing a titan to take risks is always going to be increasing the stranglehold that the larger groups have.that said, if other changes were to come into place to make reliance on titans less of an issue and to make it harder to control larger areas of space, then i could see this potentially causing less issues, but only though titans just not being used as much all round.it's a tough one :p"
9/10/2014,irl stuff can be serious and i sympathize. i just wish i was next on that list. xenuria csm
9/10/2014,"for future reference (because it is more fair), excluding a candidate is as simple as adding a line to .blt file. you just add a line after the first line (that contains # of candidates and number of seats) with the number(s) of the excluded candidates prefixed with a -you then elect the first candidate who appears in the top 14 who was not top 14 in the prior election."

9/11/2014,i could see each navy commissioning ore to create a more survivable version. maybe one that had a little more teeth to it requiring cross training in combat skills. from the navy lp?so it would not be a new skill but would require training to some current combat skills.just my reaction to first reading this.

9/11/2014,in both the skills tab and training queue windows can we have two drop down filters added right behind the filter window that is already there? the first would be for primary attribute and the second drop down would be for secondary attribute. this would allow me to find all of the skills that i can train with a specific combination of primary and secondary attributes before i use a remap.
9/11/2014,we tried to discuss this idea last year in f&i
9/11/2014,"your proposal limits titan bridges to the cfc, n3 and pl. is this intentional? can you explain how it's good game design in any way?"
9/11/2014,"i didn't realize these were locations in game, nor were they they only alliances with titans..."
9/11/2014,"hey, this is a good idea. it'd give corporations a lot more flexibility, and it helps newbros get into industry easier, because the level of trust can be defines more clearly."
9/11/2014,"no matter how we look at it, where ever multiple players can access the same storage area, there is an opportunity for theft. i am hereby coining this situation the snowden effect in that he was authorized to access everything he revealed and did nothing wrong until he revealed state secrets.being able to start jobs from a hanger using only query or some sort of 3rd access level that does not include the ability to move objects completely out of the hanger would mitigate some of the risk. ignoring directors and full take access, this would leave only jobs as the sole method of removing things.this leaves two ways to mess with things that i can see. one is to start and then cancel a job. but last i checked, this destroys all consumable materials that were put in. a thief gains nothing in this manner. for someone just looking to screw others over, this will work. however, it does require a great deal more effort, depending on what is in the hanger.the second method would be to start a bunch of jobs and then have them delivered to another hanger to which the thief does have access. of course, this is limited to how many concurrent jobs the player can run and it takes time to build everything. because the time involved to steal a large amount of assets in this manner could be hugely significant, i don't consider this to be a viable method of theft unless done quietly over time. (basically skimming.)i support this proposal because it will reduce the risk of corporate theft by the less trust-worthy corp members. but it is far from a complete fix for corporate roles."
9/11/2014,because we are trying to ensure that no existing but still representative is removed from the council. it is unlikely but theoretically possible.
9/11/2014,"you see there is one skill <U+FFFD>covert ops<U+FFFD> that when trained allows you access to two different frigate ship classes the cover ops them self<U+FFFD>s and also the stealth bombers. maybe you could be a little more clear in the solution that you seek. as elegant as your statement <U+FFFD>change the fking skill<U+FFFD> is it does leave a lot of room for misunderstanding. i can think of three different solutions you might be asking for.one, are you asking them to change the skill name to something a little more generic that would not share the same name as one of the ships? if so, maybe they could rename the skill to something like <U+FFFD>sneaky little ships<U+FFFD>two, are you asking them to rename the skill to <U+FFFD>stealth bombers<U+FFFD> and keep it<U+FFFD>s same effect giving access to both ships? my fear here is that in a week you might be back trying to fly a cover ops frigate demanding <U+FFFD>change the fking skill<U+FFFD>.three, maybe you are asking them to split the access to these ship by creating a new skill specific to stealth bombers that would only give access to the stealth bomber frigates. this type of thing has happen in the past but i<U+FFFD>m not sure we want to have one skill to train for each and every ship out there. soon you might be asking for a skill name <U+FFFD>nemesis stealth bombers<U+FFFD>. if you are looking for this solution i just can<U+FFFD>t support it.now i<U+FFFD>m sure if you were to take a little time to enlighten us as to the nuances of <U+FFFD>change the fking skill<U+FFFD> and what you have in mind we might all find a way to support your ideas."
9/11/2014,stop posting pls.your posts are almost as horrible as mine.
9/11/2014,"dear csm/ccp,i know it's a bit late to bring this up, but i did not have much time and motivation to play eve the past months, and only just found out this change has indeed affected one of the things that makes me log into eve. and this thing is dear to me, so i make this post, even though i currently have barely any hope that it will matter.in rubicon 1.1, the following change was introduced:the jettison option has been removed from various deployable structures that have a cargo hold. these items are only launched into space.when i read this, i was not active in eve, but i thought ""i hope this does not affect secure cargo containers."" but i just found out that it does, which made me .you see, the thing that i loved doing most in eve is/was sub-warp racing, but now that e-sport may never be practiced again, at least not as we know it. sub-warp racing required the tedious process of building tracks, using secure containers to build square or arrow shaped checkpoints/corners. accurate placement of these containers was already somewhat of a challenge, but after this change, it is pretty much impossible. by jettisonning, you could place them with an accuracy of around 25 meters, but launching them only gives an accuracy that's well over 1000 meters.this could be one of the reasons why i have not heard from the sub-warp race organizer in months.so, my questions: why was this change made is there any chance of reverting this change for small secure containers or even better, does this situation improve the chances of my suggestion for a checkpoint mobile structure coming to life is there a deployable that could be used for building tracks instead of secure containers that still provides good placement accuracy (close to ~25 meters)i thank you for any answers you can provide."

9/12/2014,he means because with those restrictions titans would be far more at risk (since the second a titan is out of a shield everyone wants a piece) and the only people that could survive losing titans that much are the largest coalitions. a group with 1 titan could nto afford to put that titan at risk.
9/12/2014,"i would say that it would encourage individuals/groups away from ships that they can't afford to lose, while requiring those that can to put them at risk."
9/12/2014,"exactly this. while at the moment small groups can and do use titan bridges to hurt cfc fleets, they would not be able to do so after a change like this without losing the ship. not something a group with only one or two titans can afford to do.and you seem to think this is a good thing. why is that?"

9/13/2014,"hello, this is going to be a lengthy post but i've been mulling with a similar idea... jack i understand you would like to see new ships but i believe we have the same goal in mind, a high-sec ship transport, i'll make in the form of dev post to be as clear as possible.. also in this format the csm's can bring it to the dev's with a viable option in that looks familiar in language... i'm asking everyone here to reconsider re-purposing the rorqual to be used as the flagship of these tug class concept vessels.. it's model already used in-game with attributes and stats that can be adjusted, rather then having the design team coming up with new ships, which frankly, all do the exact same thing. though the positioning of those ships as orca sized variants is still plausible for empire variants. as far as i've seen could be t2 versions of the freighters with but, being of lower mass (<300,000 kg) to facilitate wh usage they would loose most of their cargo capacity for it's dedicated purpose t2 of hauling ships... moving oni'm going to using the re-balance of the t1 logistics ships, transports and industrials. the fact carriers were/are in highsec, loot mechanics of sma in pos's, and the general purpose/ use of the ships class, and a bit of game design practicality just to toss it in the mix for proper justification...why the rorqual? it's purpose of crunching rocks has been moved to a pos module now, which is where many rorqual's usually live long boring lives giving boosts, when you look at the ship line it's a t2/ teir2 orca. speaking of which...the orca: (it's younger sibiling) is classified as an ore, capital industrial ship, that can already haul any fitted ship with-in is ship maintenance bay (smb) in hi-sec. having the rorqual be able to do the same thing would only be the conclusion to the ship line, not a significant change. it does not make sense that the smaller ship is is able to do something the the larger cannot... in fact a rorqual's smb was limited to indy ships as an after thought, even in the description.freighters and jump freighters are also capital class ships in high-sec, not to mention in days of old capitals were everywhere in hi-secwhy not a use carrier? carriers don't need to go in hi-sec, the carrier is the, small swiss army knife of eve, providing various support roles in direct combat situations. carriers have the option to join-in in fights, while bringing sub caps in it's hull to support the fleet even more, it's a combat ship first and for most.the rorqual is not a combat vessel could be used to bring ships into a system or wh with out expending time of mutliple jumps, this plays into the risk/reward factor. as a lone roqual is just prey with out the luxury of going into triage in highsec it wouldn't be able to use the industrial core module, just as you cannnot use bubbles or bomb launchers or any capital module that i'm aware of... loar(get it) lore and purposethe rorqual was previously banned from hi-sec along because the gravitational wakes of it's mass. ore realizing the needs of deep space commanders went back to the design board extensively using nanofibers and polycarbon structures to reduce the mass of the ship as well as updated ai navigation protocols from the empires keeping these ships from interfering with populated worlds.. as such concord assembly lobbied by the gallente federation, have permitted these ships to travel in high security empire space. the empires seeing a use of the rapid deployment have modified some their current freighters to fill this needore ships are primarily focused on industrial activity's on the fringes of space.. this doesn't mean these are helpless targets as the skiff and prospect can be used for other purposes which adds content for all to enjoy...this ship would be similar to a freighter in speed pilots would have to consider carrying a lot of ships or moving with some speed (relative)yes it would be a big target, and would drop ships/loot similarly to any carrier or sma. would there be anything wrong with that???the numbers well i'll start with the most important smb: ~1,250,000m<U+FFFD> - 1,500,000m<U+FFFD><U+FFFD> (+250,000m<U+FFFD>-500,000m<U+FFFD>). by removing the ore hold (250,000m<U+FFFD>) adding it to the smb. again rorqual's don't sit in belts, but rather hang out in pos's.. with it's massive cargo bay mining op commanders would be wise to carry a pos, modules and fuel to ensure their operation has a fallback point and time to react to hostile forces in the area... skill bonus changes: 5% bonus to mining foreman links (was 10% only if in industrial core mode)remove shield boost bonuses from hererole bonus changes:+1000% to range of all remote shield boosters (was 50% per level to capital remote shield booster range)the survey scan range and cargo scan range would be fleet bonuses (rather then local)..100% bonus to mining foreman link effectiveness when industrial core module is activated (bring fleet bonuses back inline)hull changes:-30,000 shields hitpoint-10,000 armor hitpoints-60,000 structure hitpointsmass: 950,000 kg (-230,000 kg) allows it move through hi-sec gates or c4 wh's (similar to rhea jf's @ 960,000 kg)maximum jump range: 3.5 ly (-1.5ly) consumption ammount: 5000 (+300)warp speed: 1.37au/s (-0.13au/s)price tag: 10 billion isk (positioning it between super and capitals, but over jf's. just as the orca is between a bs and a carrier)skill set changes:i don't have a full answer for that yet i'ld love some input summary: tl;drwith these changes to the rorqual it, sacrifices robustness and some mobility, for versatility and practicality, able adapt to fill the various needs of all kinds of deep space industrialists, while also being usable as our mystical hs-wh carrier. i'm open to any idea's and useful comments.

9/14/2014,"while i agree that isboxer should not be allowed you can't go banning people for just having multiple accounts, before the first graphics expansion around 08 i ran 8 clients with out a program, after that number dropped to 4 and then to 1 with a desktop that locks up and a laptop that runs slow. i have seen ganks with is boxer and those people have had ships replaced due to it, so basically ccp calls the other accounts bots but yet it allowed"
9/14/2014,"however, if using the rorqual model, one would presume an ore manufactured ship. and as previously stated, ore would not directly involve themselves in building ships that would overtly be used to transport war ships. it would ruin their neutrality, and likely cause other factions to target them for facilitating this.and who said this would just be high sec? because a later incarnation could be jump capable to facilitate transit from high to low/null in a more expedient and efficient manner.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
9/14/2014,"that almost sounds plausible, execpt, it seems you've missed a few thingsore:- is not redesigning it for the explicit use in war, ship hauling is a legitimate business- isn't neutral to the empires, they have high level ties in the gallente empire, remaining diplomatic with the others- employs others for security, and uses diplomacy (fed navy blasters of the black eagles) to keep pirates neutral- does this already in with orca hull (you can place any fitted ship up to bc in a orca) with out any repercussions.- the empires rely on ore hulls for their industrial needs, it would be suicide to attack orethe rorqual will keep it's jump drive: changes can be found in "" the numbers "" the range will be nerfed a little, but it's designed is to allow mining commanders to establish a mining outpost in the remote corners of the cluster, even deep into anoikis. as certain systems may only have a path leading to hi-sec. the roqual would be able to take advantage of these circumstances. also when going into the unknown it's wise to bring spare ships and modules"
9/14/2014,i think this is a bad idea. ceptors have already been nerfed.. why does it need to be nerfed again? are you not able or capable to think or find strategies to kill them?reason they work so well is because they are well made now. there doesn't need more nerfing.. there needs balancing.. so nerfing = bad. soon the only ship good will be rookie ships.

9/14/2014,"hello, my name is defiant blessings and i've been a broker and character appraiser on the bazaar for over a year, and have been trading characters for / on behalf of clients for over 5 years.very recently, ccp have changed their stance on 3rd parties posting the sale thread of one or more characters on the bazaar, and has negatively impacted my business model in a number of ways. however, this change in the rules interpretation does not remove the possibility of my service, rather it only serves as yet another stumbling block and obstacle in the way of a very large number of players new to the bazaar from safely selling their characters.i would like to request the assistance of the community, as well that of my clients, to help tell csm and subsequently ccp that this change is not what we want!edit: this came about after a number of my vip client's sales threads had been locked, and a newly worded ruling on the matter of character bazaar posts had been released on the rules thread. i feel this is unfair to the people of eve and of the bazaar mostly because 3rd party sales via unscrupulous methods (such as not announcing clearly the ownership of the char, as i had) have been allowed to continue for quite some time. i feel like by being honest, open, and transparent my service has been punished, and i don't believe this is a direction ccp should take the rules of selling characters. a link to one of my recently locked threads can be found here.thank you all for your time, and i hope to see you all on the bazaar!cheers,~defiant blessings"

9/14/2014,what's the issue if eve gets money ? get real
9/14/2014,i'm gonna channel malcanis and say that this is a pretty darn terrible idea.3rd parties can post threads if they can post as the character...assuming they can control the character. otherwise? alllllll kinds of scamming inbound.
9/14/2014,"thanks for bringing this up.this rule is in place for a reason, to reduce the risk of character sales scamming and to serve as a confirmation that the character being sold is indeed owned by the person looking to sell.this rule will not change, and the requirement for a sales thread to be posted by the character that is being sold as a confirmation of ownership will stand.with that in mind, there's nothing more to discuss in this thread, so it's now being locked.please do not re-open this topic as this decision is final, and please refrain from further spamming of the the fourm report system.ccp falcon || eve universe community manager || @ccp_falcon"
9/14/2014,you want to fix nullsec?here is funny one :'every time you cross to nullsec your skill learning stops'no exceptions......cheers!
9/14/2014,"uh... what?ccp are using a wright single transferable vote system. the position of people on a ballot has no effect on any other ballot. votes cascade down at a percentage of the voting power for a candidate which exceeds the number needed. it doesn't matter where someone else's vote puts a candidate.if you need 250 votes to be elected, and you get 1000, all active ballots with you on them cascade down to the next candidate at 75% efficiency."
9/14/2014,"at the risk of sounding rude, i don't think you understand what i am saying. unless ccp changed something since last election the problem i describe still exists."
9/14/2014,"then explain it. because you're claiming that someone else can affect the value of my vote in a negative fashion. either that, or you're being disingenuous in your wording of 'whaaa, the cfc can get more people to vote, which means the people who voted for me have their votes be a smaller percentage of the total'"

9/15/2014,there's a difference between using third party software and using that same third party software in a waythis also means that the request to ban isboxer by itself is the wrong approach (reasons here). using software (or wooden sticks) in such a way should result in a ban if discovered.

9/16/2014,"i have been dealing with this problem for sometime, buying or selling items is simple enough, my own orders are shown in dark blue which is highly visable but the problem comes up when you incorporate the corporation wallet currently if i make a buy or sell order for my corp it shows it exactly the same way as my own transactions, transactions i have made on behalf of my corp are shown in light blue text, ok so far seems simple but now this is where is all goes pear shaped. in the orders section of my wallet it shows the total buy and sell orders in isk it doesnt show how much is made for the corp and how much is personal orders which is a major headache when my own wallet is low because i dont know how much isk i have to play with (same applies if corp wallet i use happens to be low at the time).additionally if other members make orders on behalf of the corp i cant see them in the market window.i suggest that the corp and personal buy/sell orders are seperated this should be simple enough as the orders are set up using either your personal wallet or a corp wallet.secondly corp orders in the market should be highlighted in say green or light blue so they can easily be seen by other traders (with corp wallet access) acting on behalf of the corp. (colour should be different to each trader ie if i setup a personal order it should be as it is now (dark blue) if i set up one for the corp it should be light blue (to me) and if another trader in my corp sets up an order it should be say green.)"
9/16/2014,personal orders show up blue in the market window. why can't we have another colour for corp orders? this would be very helpful for station/reigon traders. ccp fix this please
9/16/2014,
9/17/2014,that's exactly the point i was making only in a more expanded manner.
9/17/2014,"i assumed wrongly that the wikipedia article on the specific voting method would explain it. no voting system is perfect but obviously some are more prone to abuse in certain situations.the vote power can be affected in a negative way mathematically by manipulating ballot positions to ""counter"" common ballots of other blocs.example:cfc ballot: a b c d l k mbloc 1 ballot: m u i w d l peven though ""m"" is the first choice on a ""common ballot"" or ""ballot configuration"" if another alliance or entity wants to make sure that person gets less of a vote they can put that person on the tail end of their ballot. if cfc ballot had no m on it then m would have more vote power. that is how you do it."
9/17/2014,
9/18/2014,yeah you seem to have missed my point. also isboxer doesn't actually do those things as proven many times before.
9/18/2014,1
9/18/2014,let's get some more support for this.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
9/18/2014,with the proper remap i could shave around 10 days off my 70 day skill plan.......not huge but its still tangible.
9/18/2014,what?! get rid of this fantastic running gag?! no way!(it even made it to the at xii commercials!)
9/18/2014,to counter nullbears putting 50+ bubbles around their gates.
9/18/2014,"i'm not a fan of interdiction nullified ships.... i think the change that needs to be made is to the interdiction nullification mechanics. once, i think during dominion, ccp accidentally nerfed interdiction nullification mechanics. it made it so ships could warp out of a bubble, but if there was a bubble at their warp destination they'd still get pulled into it. this is the change that is needed. make it happen again, and then the nullified ships still have a vulnerability!"
9/18/2014,mad about the fact that there is a class of ship that is among the most fragile and dps-less in the universe that can escape from a gate camp? c'mon!
9/18/2014,you could click on the little flag above the text...
9/18/2014,"that is actually a very good thought.maybe, with a sov system overhaul, ccp could implement some way to reward pilots out of the alliance wallet for doing whatever secures sov. optional, and scalable by the alliance directorate, of course.e.g. in a usage-based system, have isk paid automatically to pilots who use the system in the specified manner."
9/18/2014,"well, that large group hellcamping someone out of their sov might very well return to their home and find that they have lost their system. when you hellcamp elsewhere, you cannot use your own system, which in a use-based sov system, surprisesurprise, makes you lose it...so the pipes are sovless... *gasp*no really: so what?"
9/18/2014,"the idea of the tug-of-war is the best i have seen so far. i have independently of op drawn up a tug-of-war mechanics description (features and ideas section) and have even independently selected the same term... :)what i would like to discuss is why the sovereignty index should be tied to so many pve-activities. it seems overly complex, and is prone to balancing issues. and the attacker has little influence on it except by trying to prevent the sov holder from doing those (and he can only prevent in-space activities, not station-based ones).also, sovereignty means dominance, control. how is dominance achieved? by military might.i am thinking that the sov index should be a ""simple"" matter of comparing or counting military presence in a system over time. index is increased by presence of armed, piloted, un-posed, uncloaked ships of sov holder (or of ships that have the sov holder blued). larger ships / more advanced tech grant more points.such ships from alliances that have sov holder set to red decrease the index.what do you think?"
9/18/2014,"i did not mean your idea would not work. it actually sounds good to me.however i beleive it may be a little more complex then it needs to be.if a large alliance can benifit much more from focusing on a smaller group of systems, then holding systems they do not need, i believe that would be enough. the extra mechanics restricting fleets according to the level of those holding the system seem like over kill to me. if a power house alliance can spend their pve time in their own system, making it even better, why would they waste time on a less valuable system. out for a pvp roam, sure, but roams are not about taking space, they are about finding fights.there will be issues with larger alliances keeping the pipes clean, possibly even keeping pipes sov free, rather than waste time upgrading them, just to travel through them.i would say pair your idea down into stages. start out with a simple basic use it or lose it sov system. then add additional mechanics to balance things as players adapt to the new system. it is hard to predict exactly what impact the changes will have. you could have a group diliberately keep a decent system within jump range free of sov, just so they can jump in for a fight with anyone who decides to try and claim it. or you could get the power blocks keeping there primary systems, and maintaining a large buffer of unclaimed space around them. as you say, it would be a choice between using time to improve core systems, or using that time to hinder others. each alliance will have to find their own balance, adding another dynamic to sov mechanics, with rewards and penalties for all choices."
9/18/2014,"to answer honestly, i primarily pve, so that is the experience that i'm drawing upon for ideas. i absolutely want sov to be based on activity, but it should be equally distributed throughout all of the activities possible that a sov-holder wants to do. it should also force the sov-holder to engage in as many forms of point-gaining activities as possible to maximize their point pool and increase the buffer against harassment. if a group only does thinga or thingb to the exlusion of thingc, they are losing out on points and making it that much easier for a different group to harass/attack their points and drop their index.certainly ships produced/insured/lost etc by the sov-holders should play into their point pool, however, simply having blues in your space (think cyno alts, indy alts, super/titan alts, etc) doing nothing should not add to the sov, as these characters are essentially leaching off the system. you gain sov by doing, not by being. does that help?thanks!"
9/18/2014,"the point of upgrading surrounding systems is to make the super/titan game a difficult one to start, and an easy one to disrupt. if you lose a level in a buffer system, word gets to the home system and all the minions building your titan go on strike because they don't feel safe (or some other rp mechanic!). as far as purposely keeping space 'neutral', if an entity wants to spend the time not upgrading while at the same time using resources to make sure no one else does... fine with me. sandbox and all :)thanks"
9/18/2014,"and pray tell why? how does it make the sov mechanic better to base it on so many different activities?and how - i am drawing a real life comparison here - does mining make you secure your claim on territorial dominance, other than indirectly by allowing you to produce the tools of war?and would it actually help an invasion if the attacker sent in a battalion of mining ships...?since the attackers can bring their alts as well, i dont think that would be a problem.again, i think tug-of-war is the alchemist's stone. i just wonder about what the best method(s) for gaining and deducting sov index points should be. i am inclined towards military presence only, because it is a) something both sides can do equally well and b) it is much simpler and c) it is more real life-esque.i think sov should be fought over, not mined/ratted/relic site hacked/invented over."
9/18/2014,"which the suggestion does: if you project your forces elsewhere, you are not at home (or not in any other system) where your sov claim can be nibbled away by small(er) groups. and it it will be increasingly difficult with more systems to defend them, as the crucial attack/defense does not happen at a certain point of time anymore - to which you can force project your entire armada - but to an extended period of time, which means you have to distribute your forces over time and space, which is more difficult the more space you have to cover."
9/18/2014,"...the wiki article didn't explain it because stv doesn't work that way, or at the very least wright stv doesn't work that way. so here's what happens in your mock election, assuming 2000 ""common ballot"" and 1000 cfc votes, with a quota of 1000 (which means two seats - quota = votes/[seats + 1]). first-choice appearances are tallied, which gives us m and then a as meeting the quota and...that's it. they get elected, election over.2000 cfc ballots and 1000 bloc 1 ballots ends the same way in the above example.if it's a three seat election then quota = 3000/4 = 750 votes for election. as with above, first choice votes are tallied, m has 2000 votes, a has 1000 votes, both are provisionally elected. excess votes on the bloc 1 ballot are calculated first, as they have more votes. there are 1250 excess votes, 2000 total votes were cast on that line, so 1250/2000 = .625 votes per ballot in the line passes to the second place candidate on the list, or .625 * 2000 = 1250 (obviously the math is easy with such a simple set of ballots, it gets much messier and complicated when you have more variety). anyway, u has more than 750 votes, so u is elected, and the election is done - all three seats have been filled.flip that around, 2000 cfc ballots and 1000 bloc 1 ballots and it works the same way, except a & m are elected and cfc excess elects b. bloc 1 ballots have excess as well, which they never get a change to distribute, though it doesn't actually matter as 250 votes won't elect anyone anyway.four seat? quota of 600 votes. back to the original example, a & m are elected, u is elected from 1400 spill-over votes, his spill-over is then calculated, 800 votes pass to i. likewise, 2000 cfc ballots and 1000 bloc 1 ballots elects a and m and then b & c.etcso let's take the extreme example. 2000 cfc votes and 1000 bloc 1 votes, but the election is for 8 seats, so a quota of 334 votes. the earlier mentioned simplistic nature of the ballots makes calculating this really easy - take 2000 and subtract 334 votes, pass to the next in line. so a is elected with 2000 votes, passes 1667 to b, who passes 1332 to c, who passes 998 to d, who passes 664 to l, who passes 330 to k. well, crap, still not enough seats to prove my point, really... we wind up wiith a, m, b, c, d, and l elected, then it distributes excess on the bloc 1 ballot and we pick up u and i as well. huh. not enough to prove my point. what about a 10 seat election? i can't hardly go any higher than that, you've only got 12 candidates listed. so now we've got 273 votes as a quota, 2000 votes for the cfc ballot, 1000 for the bloc 1. and now we're talking. candidates a & m are elected, the line with a on it has the most votes, so their excess is distributed. and wouldn't you know it, it trickles down to 362 votes passing along their line to candidate m, who according to you now loses the election, or something.well no, not really. he's already elected, so those votes skip him, try to go to the next person, which doesn't exist, and so just fizzle out and do nothing. we've only got 8 people elected and need 10, so we move on to count the excess on the bloc 1 ballot, and enough votes cascade down to elect u and i as well.works the same way in reverse if we say bloc 1 has 2000 votes and the cfc ballot has 1000. m and a are elected, then u, i, w, d, l and p make it in on m's spillover, b and c make it on a's spillover.at no point in this process does it matter at all that m was listed on the tail end of the cfc ballot, and i'm not sure there's any stv system where just listing someone on the end of your ballot is a route to ****ing them over, just because it's such a blindingly obvious hole in these voting systems, which believe it or not, were crafted by their designers to be fair.so yeah. there's that."
9/18/2014,"funny how we keep bumping into each other. i am not very good with numbers so i am not in a good position to refute your essay on the subject matter. maybe i missed something or overlooked something, it's very likely any time numbers are involved.even conceding that particular point the fact that the mittani can buy up thousands of accounts just months before the deadline and use them for votes is something i think should at the very least be discussed internally by the csm. ccp has maintained that scamming or coercing votes out of people is perfectly legitimate, just as is paying people isk for votes. however i feel that the ~meta~ of having enough money in real life or in plex to farm accounts for the sole purpose of voting is unfair. i have said it before and i will say it again. eve is a microcosm of a social civilization. as such the same ills of any real world system of voting or governance can be seen here in new eden. the csm being stacked with cfc members is not in dispute at this point, rather what is a subject of discussion is should anything be done about it.is this echo chamber ""working as intended"" or are external factors being used unfairly. if you wanted to spear head that line of discussion you would save me having to run for csm."

9/19/2014,"my thought process on including indy/pve activities in the sov mechanic:jobs creation. in my mind (and to fill in the rp/lore side of things) the capsuleer is basically trying to become ""king"" of the system. a good king looks out for his subjects and makes sure they are happy. i want each of the people living on the planets that i'm the king of actually want to be my subject...hence i have sovereignty over them. on the other hand, i could just flex my muscles and fly ships through the system and blow stuff up. both are ways of ""dominating"" the system, and either alone could do the job, so why not include both in this mechanic."
9/19/2014,"steve mentioned the discussion in the thread to me, so i swung by to take a look. seeing as i wrote an extensively read blog post on the topic back when ccp swapped to wright, misunderstandings of the system are at least of casual understanding to me, regardless of who is making them. in any case, use that as a starter, read the wiki etc if you're worried i may have distorted it in my blog, and take the the time to educate yourself on how the system actually works, then perhaps we can have a discussion about the system without resorting to things that neither side can satisfactorily prove or disprove like ""buying thousands of accounts to vote with.""as to the csm being ""stacked"" with cfc numbers, i can pretty much assure you that the number of cfc members on the csm is more or less exactly commensurate with the total proportion of votes cast, plus or minus the granularity brought on by ""thousands of votes"" as compared to ""fourteen slots"". i did however just return from a night of drinking in iceland, so **** if i can go back and dig into the ballot right now to demonstrate this. however, if you agree that two step is probably a neutral, uninterested party, you can use his numbers here. we put two definitively cfc candidates on the council, by which i mean we had two people - myself and sion - in our top slot of the recommended ballot. ancillary candidates included angry moustache, jayne fillion and xander phoena, who made it in. technically you can call ali aras a cfc candidate as well - she was featured prominently on the ballot - but while two step's analysis doesn't show this, a cursory examination of the results file will show you that she made it in entirely on the strength of her own support, and ours didn't actually do anything for her.anyway.based on two step's analysis, we cast anywhere from 14% to 26% of the votes, depending on whether you count full votes only, or full votes and partial votes, or somewhere in between. see his thread for definitions of that. stv is supposed to produce a result proportional to the voting population (that's important and we'll come back to it). so, 14% times 14 seats - that's 1.96 candidates on the council, more or less exactly equal to sion and i. at 26%, it'd be 3.64 candidates on the council. as xander very likely had a decent chunk of his own support in addition to whatever votes cascaded down to him, plus whatever portion of gents (at the time) listed him in first place, i think it's pretty safe to say that the cfc is in fact represented exactly as we should be given the turnout for this year.which brings me back to that important phrase ""the voting population."" whether you believe or not that the votes are ""real"" or are just dummy accounts...doesn't matter, really. no election system in the world can claim to accurately represent a population where a portion of the population does not vote, and frankly the eve population is put to shame by approximately ""every democratic country on the planet"" when it comes to turnout. and again being perfectly frank, there are two kinds of people in eve: those who, to be charitable, do not like you, and those who have not heard of you. the latter probably also fall into the category of ""do not vote."" if you want to do something to diminish the cfc's presence on the cfc, my recommendation would be to try to reach out to those people and get them voting, rather than try to run yourself. good luck - many others have tried.with that said, i'm drunk and tired, and my bed is calling. i'm out - peace."
9/19/2014,"i understand what you are saying i just don't agree with all of it.you say that if the number of cfc candidates is proportional to the voting bloc than no problem exists. i simply disagree.eve is not perfect, it's just as crooked and messy as anything in the real world. that said i think that all players are stakeholders in eve as a product, as such rules should exist to limit or at the very least shine light on the presence of an echo chamber. even if you aren't willing to entertain the idea that your master buys accounts for voting you can at least accept the plausibility of such a tactic. money/isk should not equal votes/delegates at least not at a 1 to 1 relation. right now it does. i see this as a structural problem with the csm.hypothetically a single player can change an entire election simply by being inordinately wealthy and committed to doing so."

9/20/2014,"while i was not on for this, it has come to my attention one of our corp members has been perma banned.with ccp flip flopping over everything i would like an opinion from the elected csm members. this is not about cyno bumping.the simple question is, is this titan fair game to bump?"
9/20/2014,bumping stuff which is inside the forcefield is seen as an exploit afair. there should be a gm response to this topic in this forum somewhere (1 year ago or so).
9/20/2014,"the rules have been notoriously unclear regarding this, with most members believing partially exposed titans being fair game. i have seen several players requesting ccp to make an additional post to clear the situation out, but i have not seen any official responses. to get permabanned in this manner, under these circumstances, must be an error, and i hope the situation can be resolved happily."
9/20/2014,"i believe it is unfortunate that ccp take the approach of perma-ban and ask questions after. the format of ""you are perma-banned unless you would like to respond to us"" seems silly. it's as if every engagement must be fraps'd in case you have to go back and prove you weren't breaking today's rule. suddenly we are like the police and have to video record everything? silly. there needs to be a better process. - zion"
9/20/2014,"the part bumped wasn't inside the forcefield and was able to be interacted with, multiple titans have been killed by this method due to going too far out of the shield and being bumped further, this is completely different to what you're referring to where titans were being bumped while fully insidea perma ban for this and the reimbursement of a titan lost due to the pilots mistake is crazy."
9/20/2014,"this should, in no way, be seen as an ""exploit"" bump. it is tragic that, an irresponsible titan pilot, who had obviously left himself vulnerable, should be reimbursed and that a player should be permabanned for what should have been a legal bump using a tornado. ccp has, at this point, completely removed any element of risk to owning a ""pos titan"", which is counter to the spirit of the game as we know it. if this kill was not a ""legal"" kill, then everyone must know that they cannot, ever, try and touch a titan in a pos in any way that would lead to it's destruction (unless it is an awox apparently). even if the titan (or any ship for that matter) is sticking out of the shields. this along with the new change to cynoing on a tower will make having a titan in lowsec absolutely risk free. that's really just what we need (#sarcasm)."
9/20/2014,"the playerbase have been roaring over the pos bumping issue as a potential exploit for weeks with no response from ccp. for some reason you've now decided to address it, badly. instead of acknowledging that there was an issue - and that ignoring it was an error - you've chosen to perma-ban someone who was likely acting in good faith based on current mechanics. if you are going to mix this kill in with the other (two?) titanposbumped kills when it is clearly not in the same bracket, i'd like to see the list of other people perma-banned. you don't have to accept eyewitness accounts, or 3rd party vids, but you could engage a shred of common sense and a bit of decency when dealing with these issues. seriously, this is a grossly unfair punishment directed at the wrong individual(s).please stop retrospectively permabanning people for flawed gameplay mechanics which are strenuously reported - then ignored."
9/20/2014,"o7hello, i hope you are having an excellent spaceday.i think medical clone costs should be reduced by 90%.the mechanic is interesting and adds depth to the game through consequence, but the isk cost is too high considering the already-severe penalty for experiencing clone loss after failing to maintain an updated clone.i think there are three factors that, while mild on their own, are too punishing when they are all true [simultaneously]. isk cost of medical clones is high consequence of failure is high eve is not a default free-to-play game [but gameplay is taxed by default] isk cost of medical clones is high.fortunately, i find myself needing higher-grade medical clones due to training, rather than pvp loss. in the last two months i have incurred almost 350 million isk in medical clone costs for training. if i lose pods in pvp, i will incur this cost again, and there is no limit to the number of times i can face this fee.consequence of failure is high.should i fail to maintain updated medical clones, i stand to lose the one thing that can only be gained with time: sp. my characters are currently using +4 and +5 attribute implant sets, so re-acquiring those implants after a medical clone loss merely resumes sp accumulation. this falls short of regaining lost sp, even in exchange for isk. it is a permanent loss of subscription time.eve subscriptions are not automatically free-to-play.but the medical clone cost is automatic, as if eve was automatically free-to-play. in other words, medical clone costs are a default tax on gameplay when, by default, gameplay costs real money.of these three factors, the only one that can be expected to change is the isk cost of medical clones. i think the isk fee should exist as a formality, in amounts that are one-tenth of their current levels."
9/20/2014,you got podded enough to blow 325 million isk on cloning fees? were you pvp training? because you can't get podded doing pve unless i missed something.
9/20/2014,accumulated enough sp to break the clone's saved sp limit.
9/20/2014,"you have been playing far longer than i have, and in my opinion, you need to learn to manage money, rather than push for changing cloning costs. i've upgraded past the skill point limit a couple times, and been podded as well. yet i can still manage to afford to update clone all while keeping a ship wrapped around my capsule for more pewpew. that's coming from somebody that has only played a month or so."
9/20/2014,"you're essentially engaging a question that's been around for as long as the idea of voting has been; namely do those that do not engage deserve a voice. you may not be asking it directly, but what you are putting forward is just another angle, another side of the question. the voting system in eve is wide open. there's nothing about the system itself that prevents or prohibits someone from voting . so with that in mind, let me pose to you the counter question: how does any course of action, any change to the voting system itself produce a better outcome for those that do not make their voice heard than ensuring they are aware that they have the choice in the first place is something they are aware of? how does punishing those who do make their voice known, loudly and effectively, improve things for those who don't speak up at all? or to pose this a third way, if a notional ""silent majority"" exists, how do you claim to know what they want, that the beliefs you propose are in their best interests or in their interests at all? after all, they're silent.as to the notional buying of votes, i'm well aware that it's plausible, as i studied the plausibility myself...and concluded its a hilarious waste of a lot of isk in light of the fact that we've demonstrated the ability to capture two seats with straight vote power since well before we were ever wealthy enough to consider buying them."
9/21/2014,i would love to hear from the developers how anyone would have know that bumping a ship sitting outside of a pos would be considered an exploit. i fully expect ccp to make this right.
9/21/2014,in regard to this particular thread nulli seems to have taken this issue and went on a parade with this. it is a bit of an insult that they go out in public and wave around their new titan. the link to their thread . it is of course in japanese. you will need to translate that of course.
9/21/2014,*snip*
9/21/2014,"it all depends how ccp defines ""inside the forcefield"". is it ""you can not lock it"" = inside? ship center inside = inside? everything inside = inside? i don't know.i only posted what i think was the last official gm response on the topic."
9/21/2014,the problem is this information flips all the time. one gm will say someone else and another gm will say something against what the other gm just said.
9/21/2014,"do the gm's even play this game and understand how it works? how can one pilot receive a perma ban for what has been regarded as a legitimate tactic for the longest time, when the pilots performing the actual exploit elsewhere walk away unpunished?pretty sloppy work from the gm team at the very least."
9/21/2014,"so, bumping titans which are completely inside the pos shield by means of a mass super jump to a nearby cyno is ok, but bumping one left sticking out of the shield is permabannable offense??this has to be one of the stupidest things i've heard in a while."
9/21/2014,"ok yeah, guilty as charged. i did get caught without enough liquid to cover clone costs. it's one of those things in eve that if it was to my liking i wouldn't make a thread about it, of course. if it was a nominal fee, i wouldn't have been short on isk, either. i dunno. i kinda knew it was going to be my personal crusade of the week, did some forum + google searches for the latest med clone discussion but they were all old.having made my point and looking around... obviously there are bigger issues, and i'm ok with this particular one... kinda. this one i can deal with and move on.especially after reading your reply, so thanks for that, mi-lin. i think that's the most innocent comment i've ever witnessed in eve.i didn't use the words ""naive"" or ""cute"" because they would sound condescending. but yeah i wanted to ruffle the fur on the cute wittle newbieanyway, about my isk... one thing that happens after some experience and wondering how to get isk is market trading. buy some things, sell them, meanwhile you hold on to a lot of stock. it's an easy mistake to end up with too much inventory, which is what i've done. my immediate sellable inventory is around... 11 b. other assets of mine require extra steps to sell, like the 3 billion isk outfts worn by six? seven of my characters. [i'm imagining all the players who have ridic amounts of isk who would read this and be like 'rain stop being poor']it's a good point that higher upkeep costs are part of the territory for an experienced, sp- heavy player / character. i should and can afford it. buuuut i'm sure you can relate: having funds to buy something doesn't mean you'll be happy about needing to. the inconvenience becomes a danger when it's not a one-time expense, and there's no limit to how many times you'll incur this purchase. no matter how much isk you have, any sum can 'break the bank' if it's applied an infinite number of times. this is definitely true at about tree fiddy million a pop. (pops. a sequence of soul crushing pops)normally, when something is hopelessly broken, the answer is 'don't do it'. but in this case, the 'thing' is playing at all--being out in space or accumulating sp passively (both are things that can break clone limits).a good thing about high clone costs is it promotes ship class progression. in order for the 'just-for-dying' expense to be proportionately justified, i'm limited to capital ship ops, or supporting capital ship ops. it would be nice if that was the intention.. it's a valid concept that more sp equals bigger ships... i understand how it could be seen as a good thing from ccp's perspective. but, again, even for the purpose of pushing higher ship classes, the unlimited number of times you would have to purchase new clones after losses makes the feature a broken one.the smart thing to do is maintain several focused, low-skilled characters. i didn't understand this until it was far too late. but should grooming high sp characters be a mistake? that's what it is right now."

9/21/2014,"i understand your argument and concede that it has merit. you have information that i simply do not and my perception is such that because the csm has become a cfc echo chamber there must be something wrong. the reality it seems is that nothing is ""wrong"". that said i disagree with you on some fundamentals. just because the cfc has the largest bloc does not mean it needs a proportional amount of delegates. as it stands i think only one delegate should be allowed for each bloc. this way others who have less of a voice can get a chance to have their interests voiced.each spot should be for a single delegates from a specific demographic."
9/21/2014,"the problem is defining the demographics. are incursions a demographic? because a lot of incursion runners are alts of people who do other things, like wormholes and nullsec. how about 'industrialists' because they're smeared over the whole of new eden.it's a nice sound bite, but it doesn't translate well to reality."
9/21/2014,"yeah, the system in place right now has the perks of being transparent, representative of the voters but not of the population . which is pretty much as it should be. if you want things to change then get the people to vote, not complain that those who did failed to vote for you.going back to the original concept that being at the bottom of a power block ballot would somehow ruin the candidates chances please re examine the last election and the cfc ballot.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"

9/22/2014,"it doesn't fit within the spirit of the ""sandbox"" style of this game for a ship that has several km sticking out of a force field to be not bumpable. if the player in question had of used some sort of hack or had even been within the forcefield like they said maybe i would feel different.also to permanently ban someone that has spent years training a character over a rule that is not well known or known at all is outrageous."
9/22/2014,"if i had being flying around and seen said titan, i would have thought it was fair game. i think ccp got this one wrong and said player should have never being band for his actions."
9/22/2014,"when and where was the public announcement made that this was an exploit and would result in a ban?please reconsider and revoke the ban on aglon's account, extremely harsh and seems to have come out the blue."
9/22/2014,i call this bs. are the nc. guys baned for using the cyno and titans to bump the titan out? no. so what the actual f...
9/22/2014,i have now had 4 groups of people we shoot at regularly (people with a legit interest in there being one less of us) convo me to say aglon got an unfair deal- fix this ccp.
9/22/2014,ccp have really over reacted on this but because this isnt a big 0.0 aliance shadow cartel & soul takers are unlikely to get any luck.i'm with them on this the titan sticking out like that is fair game to bump. if you can't safely park your titan in a large pos then you really shouldn't be flying one in the first place.ccp need to reinstate the account of aglon. and provide clearer clarification on the rules.
9/22/2014,"two things i'd like to points out: ccp has a policy of not commenting or sharing gm communications. there are probably details we are unaware of, and won't become aware of. if a guy was perma banned for simply bumping a titan ship out of the pos, without forewarning and/or a chance to toe the line of ccp's fairly ambiguous precedent, i'd support getting that permabanned removed. it seems pretty severe. however, i really wonder if there is much more to this story than is being made public!"
9/22/2014,it is completely ridiculous that a game that serves as a vehicle to form friendships and into which people pour years of their lives may see a player's existance wiped out without warning and at the whim of a person that is unnaccountable and his interpretation of undisclosed rules despite ample previous accepted practice to the contrary.
9/22/2014,"a really great article written by evenews24, which includes detailed information and interviews from both sides of this:"
9/22/2014,"yo, ccp, take de dam ban down mon!"
9/22/2014,"ccp has to revoke the ban or deliver an explanation for this other than 'has not entered force field password'.to me it looks like in order to bump the titan, entering the force field of the pos was not necessary.i suspect the log 'clearly' shows the titan inside the force field not considering the whole hitbox.if thats the case apologies are in order.even if the bump happened inside the force field, permaban is still overkill.ps: i'm not affiliated to any of the partys involved, other than them propably being red to me."
9/22/2014,"being personally involved in this (i got the final blow on the titan) and knowing the involved parties, i can tell you that no, there is nothing relevant that you have not been made aware of. this issue has been completely transparent on the soul takers/shadow cartel side. the gm who banned aglon is, to put it bluntly, being lazy (not paying attention) at best, or at worst, incompetent."

9/22/2014,"hi all!though this is not a concrete proposal i believe this forum is the right place for this thread as i do want to propose something.i want to propose that the csm and ccp think about the following philosophical thoughts for a minute or two whenever they judge future proposals or changes to eve.i am a rather new player (about 18 months active playing now) but i have already seen a lot of eve.my main is living in 0-space having a lot of fun pvp fighting for cfc but i also enjoy cearbearing in high sec with my alts at times.recently i have been reading in this forums a lot and i got the strong impression that there is a never ending tug of war going on between cearbears and pvpers.as i am a bit of both i can understand both sides arguments.however there is one thing i could not disagree more about in the argumentation of many pvpers.to give at least some concrete example i will stick to the discussion on the local chat in eve but please remember that this is not meant to be a discussion on this topic but more a general philosophical discussion on ""where do you go, eve?"".in that mentioned and over and over recurring discussion here in the forums the ""remove local chat"" faction constantly argues:- it cuts my freedom to hunt down caerbaers whenever and wherever i whant- it is unrealistic- it violates the sandbox nature of eveall of you agreeing with these statements i would like to invite to think about the following quote by the philosopher jean-jacques rousseau:so to transfer that to the example lets assume the local chat is being removed without substitution.that would leave the caerbaers with no chance to effectively avoid pvp and force them to do what is against their will thereby confining their personal freedom.that is in my opinion how we should think about freedom and not the other way that simply means anarchy.speaking of realism many people do argue that if eve where real the universe would be harsh and full of pirates and there would be no such thing as a local channel.is that really true?of course there would be no such thing as a local channel but in reality the caerbaers are the vast majority in all societies and they would find other ways to protect them efficiently from pirates.maybe a mobile sensor array that constantly scans the system querying transmitter codes from all ships and warning the owner if some ship does not send a code or sends a hostile code and even monitoring gravity to tell if there are cloaked ships present somewhere in the system.in a real new eden there surely would be lawless outer space regions (as we have it with 0 and low) but in the more civilized regions (high) the billions of caerbaer dads would definitely find a way to prevent pirates effectively from killing their kids on their way to shool. there would be some super-concorde not only finishing off a criminal immediately after he committed a murder but also imprisoning him and taking away all his belongings (they can get hold on) whenever he enters their territory thereafter in a new clone.almost as unrealistic are the consequences of the wardec system.no civilized region in space would tolerate corps or alliances at war shooting at each other all over the place.too much risk of collateral damage ...civilized regions would realistically be regions where most of the time it is highly unlikely (though of course not impossible) to be shot at.corps residing in civilized regions would use espionage, economy and jurisdiction to fight each other and alliances at war in outer space would block each others logistics at the borders of lawless regions but they would not be allowed to fire at each other in civilized space without any consequences by the local authorities.so arguing pro-anarchy with the realism argument is a farce in my opinion.eve is a great game and not least because it is a sandbox.and after all i know sandbox stands for whatever ccp wants it to stand for but my believe is that sandbox is not equatable with anarchy but with freedom and maybe one should think twice about what type of freedom we are talking here.there will always be plenty of opportunities for us pvpers to do what we love as there are plenty of other pvpers in the universe.and after all to me it is the real fun to compete with someone who is a worthy opponent and not shooting at almost defenseless miners or ratters. i love my freedom to pvp whenever i want but i also concede to everybody who does not want to pvp the freedom not to do so."
9/22/2014,"anyone who actually holds such an position regarding pvp is, to put it bluntly, playing the wrong game. it's equivalent to buying a call of duty or battlefield game for the storyline, while you can technically do this, it is not what the game is for."
9/22/2014,"the majority that think local should go, don't advocate a simple removal. they know and understand that this change, should come as part of a package of changes.this will mean you will have to work a little harder to gain your intel, rather than simply seeing that hostile.also the removal of local works both ways. an enemy jumping into a system will have little or no information on what awaits him and the home field advantage may in fact increase. but then that would require people to actually do something to protect themselves. not unlike the current situation, which is rather funny as quite frankly self help and protection seems alien to many.ccp have wanted to change local for years. but as and until they find a route through this particular maze, i wouldn't hold your breath.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
9/22/2014,yet another argument one can often read on the forums :)that might be what you wish eve to be but that is not what eve actually is.if that was true eve would be like ... lets say mwo where pvp battles basically are the whole game.eve is so much more.just have a look at ccps advertising for eve on the homepage.eve should attract many different gamers with many different playstyles and roles in the sandbox:i believe they all should have their niche in the universe and their fun playing eve the way they want.and does that hurt the hardcore pvper in any way? no.
9/22/2014,"anyone can do whatever they wish, but this will mean that everyone else can try to interfere with their attempt. welcome to the sandbox.also i'd like to point out that pvp includes, but is not limited to ship combat. almost every aspect of eve is pvp. so much so, one could argue ship spinning is included. although it's been some time, since i've seen a high score thread on these forums.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
9/22/2014,all those things you listed op... they are forms of pvp and conflict too... or they fuel pvp and conflict at the very least.
9/22/2014,@mag's:i am absolutely with you.do not misunderstand me i am pro local removal - if it comes with an adequate replacement that does not involve hitting the dscan button every few seconds distracting me from focusing on the rats in an anomaly making rattin
9/22/2014,"you can't have it both ways in eve, that's the point.the very sandbox nature ensures that the freedom given, includes the freedom of screwing over everyone else. that's not forcing anything on anyone, it's been the rule since day one.i don't play chess, then complain some pieces move differently. the game is the game.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
9/22/2014,"that is part of my concern ...there are pvpers and pvpers.there are those who fight in pvp battles against each other for money, for territory or just for fun.i count myself to these.and then there are those who shoot sitting ducks ""just because"".what if they have driven away all the ducks one day and there is no one left to fuel the alliance wars ?protection for the ducks ! :)"
9/22/2014,"the thing you are not seeing is that the ""ducks"" still very much contribute to the wars and conflict they try to avoid. if they do not wish to be hit with wars and conflict then they have to not contribute to any of it... which means they can't really perform any activity in the game."
9/22/2014,that is where i disagree.i believe that we can have both:- the ganker of course should have the freedom to attack the carebear any time and anywhere- but the carebear should also have the freedom to escape and avoid battlemany people argue it is against the sandbox to admit that freedom to the carebear.that argumentation in my opinion is ridiculous.rather opposite it is against the sandbox not to give that choice to the carebear and it is forcing him doing things and it does confine his freedom.we may of course talk about their chances to achieve their conflicting goals.they should be at least 50/50 if we want to keep the sandbox really neutral.but my personal feeling is chances should be rather 70/30 in favor of the carebear.why? because the ganker is the aggressor and being the aggressor should always have a price.and after all it increases the thrill of the hunt for the ganker.
9/22/2014,"you already have the freedom to avoid or escape battle. but nothing is guaranteed and rightly so. this goes both ways.again, this has been the rule of the game since day one. it's the whole point and nature of the game. i find it rather odd that someone would join a game like this and then expect it to change for them.at this point i wonder what it is you are actually asking for. we can never have complete freedom in a sandbox, as it would be anarchy and unplayable. so we have a small set of rules and many many tools at out disposal. you have options, you always have options. but it's about playing smart, not about wishing for the game to be rigged in anyone's favour.as far as you 'price' argument is concerned. there is already a price, it just depends on which area of space you play and what other players you interact with, make you pay.high sec ganking without rights always comes with a price in actual game mechanics, just as in low. it's just that high sec's price is a higher one. but ccp want players to protect themselves and charge a price they deem fit. they don't wish to involve npcs any more than they already are. it's not their role or responsibility to protect what you have in eve, it's yours.null and whs have their own price, but with a far lower npc involvement.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
9/22/2014,"that is exactly the point :)the game should not be rigged in anyone's favor if it wants to be a real sandbox.but in fact it is currently rigged in favor of one playstyle over others.what is currently happening in high sec with all those broadband-never-ending wardeccs ?i do call that anarchy and almost unplayable.a neutral sandbox that is not rigged in anyone's favor.with as little rules as possible but enough rules to prevent anarchy.and ... rules is even the wrong word here as i am talking about giving the players choices.maby a concrete proposal will demonstrate my intentions better:introduce a complete new type of slot on all ships called acm-slots (aggression counter measure).these slots should be reserved exclusively for defensive pvp modules like warp core stabilizers, target breakers etc.so a miner would be able to harden his ship against pvp attacks without weakening its mining capabilities or a ratter would be able to do the same with his pve-fitted battleship again without weakening the ships efficiency in shooting rats.this of course is just a very ill-conceived idea i had while writing this post so there will be plenty of space for criticism.the main goal of the idea is to illustrate what i actually would like to say.right now we have the situation that the moment i am pointed and webbed and i am sitting in the wrong ship (or wrong fitted - not meaning bad but for another purpose than pvp) i am basically out of options.as a pvp pilot in a pvp fitted ship however i do have options in most cases.this situation has to be ended.in the described situation all pilots should have the same options, cards to play regardless of the hull they are sitting in.fitting a ship specially for pvp should only affect its offensive pvp capabilities (point/scram, web, ewar ...).defensive pvp capabilities should be fittable equally by all ships not influencing their capabilities in the main role they are fitted for.if that could be achieved i would be the first to claim: remove local chat without any substitute.and it would guarantee a fair game in many other situations as well."
9/22/2014,"no it isn't rigged in anyone's favour. unless you consider playing smart and working with others to succeed, being rigged.you mean war decs that are easy to avoid and even shield from completely? it's not rigged and you already have choices.your complaining about the core of the game. rather like complaing about paying a fine when landing on someone's property in monopoly.ships are balanced so that you have to make choices. one of those is higher yield or better protection. but then we have other choices in which we can choose both, but in doing so it requires more people working together to succeed.it's the same with those in combat ships. they have fitting choices to make and they may not get it right all the time. the one thing we must avoid are fotm or op ships, they will be the death of the game. it's one of the reason we have balances passes on ships.you'll never get what you're asking for. just take a look at recent balance changes to ships. there is always a price to pay, it's down to you to choose what it is and how much.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
9/22/2014,"ok you made the point, mag's :)my failure was i totally - really completely - ignored the 'working with others to succeed' aspect.of course i am aware that this is an mmo and actually that is one of the main reasons why i do play it.and i am flying around in fleets and gangs for pvp a lot.but somehow when it comes to activities other than pvp in my corp everyone does his own thing alone ...so in my head it was always: pvp = group content, pve = solo content.so i would say yes, the game is rigged against solo-pve-players (in contrast to solo-pvp which is a viable playstyle).but i agree that's tolerable considering working with others - if you have the luck to find some ;)"

9/23/2014,"all of this is a lot less serious when the name changes are restricted to e.g. once every one / two / three years, like the neural remap timer, and becomes eligible only after twelve months' of subscription."
9/23/2014,"i hope he can escalate the situation to a more senior gm, and find a more reasonable resolution then."
9/23/2014,another article about this on themittani:
9/23/2014,"the exploit notification doesn't say anything about entering the force field, or anything of that sort.it says -""bumping ships, that are located within password protected starbase force-fields, out of the force-field from outside without having the correct password or corporation/alliance permissions as configured in the tower settings, is considered an exploit. ""it's unclear when exactly is a ship considered within the force-field and when it's considered outside it.some think (and thought for years) that once a portion of the ship protrudes from the field - it's fair game to bump it outside.heck, i'll bet a toe even ccp thought that for some time, and they policed the game accordingly.others think that a ship is outside the field when it's lockable, and while it's not - it's a no no.that's what ccp seem to think at the moment, and they police the game accordingly.all this mess could be easily avoided with clear phrasing of official statements, leaving no room for interpretation. ""unfortunatly"" that would also commit ccp to have a clear, consistent outlook on a number of issues, depriving it of tail-wagging space and its usual sporadic behaviour.either way, aglon made a scapegoat is ridiculous, given the fact that travis musgrat seemed to walk away from his cyno-bump - it only shows the double standards at work, something that doesn't add to experience of doing business with ccp.so, to sum it up - clean up the official exploit notifications and un-ban the guy."
9/23/2014,"of course you are completely right about that. i was trying to make a point.i am perfectly aware of the mechanics and also of the notifications. but to any player that isn't , the titan is clearly partially exposed. when you don't need to enter the force field in order to bump, how can this be an exploit?the problem is not the lack of awareness of exploit notifcations, or incomplete understanding of game mechanics. its the game client, that shows a ship, thats supposed to be inside the force field to be outside.how can you ban someone for getting misleading information from the client?next they release an exploit notification, saying there is a speed limit on high sec undocks and start banning people not slowing down immediatly. well the client doesn't say anything about it, but there has been a notification somewhere on the website... ?ccp needs to get this right."
9/23/2014,"the sandbox of eve is for players to build, explore and create without limits. from time to time players have been know to find and abuse exploits, this was not one of those times. aglon was faced with a titan showing a vulnerability and he had the skills required to capitalize on the situation. no exploits were used to gain entry into a force field. no cyno<U+FFFD>s were used to knock the titan out. please do the correct thing ccp, unban aglon. someone has put years of hard work into the making of that character, don't wipe it away like it was nothing."
9/23/2014,confirming everything targ said above. do the right thing here ccp.
9/23/2014,"and now a word from the other side of this debate.*camera pans over to the empty seats across the table as a tumbleweed rolls by*there you have it folks, not even your own elected representatives have stepped up to say anything about this. something to remember come election day i am sure, unless there is a scandal involving a rubber duck, a bag of strange white powder and your favorite politician. we now take you live to jita where another scammer has promised double isk back.. over to our live commentator.. in jita!"
9/23/2014,"trolol. been about 4 days with no csm or a ccp response. however i am not surprised from csm. as a majority of the members just represent null sec. kinda begs the question, what is the point? from this verdict how it stands now pos titans would not have any risk other than axowing or spies. suppose it is a good time to resub a spy alt and get a proxy again."
9/23/2014,let's hope ccp do the right thing here. so let's try to get as much support for this thread as possible! #freealgon
9/23/2014,this really needs a response from a gm with a definitive answer to the exploit situation. community manager www.battleclinic.com @battleclinic loadouts + killboards + forums twitter @anabaric_eve www.the-bastards.net recruitment: open
9/23/2014,"the exploit notification was clarified:""it is considered an exploit to bump ships that are located within starbase force-fields by any means that bypasses the requirement for a correct password or access permissions, as configured in the starbase tower settings, to achieve the bump. if a password or access permission would not normally be required to achieve the bump, the action is not covered by this notification.""the clarification doesn't leave much room for interpretation: if you bump a part that's sticking out of the force field, you obviously won't need any kind of access permission etc. to achieve the bump and your actions are not covered by the exploit notification. the gms can still of course ban you for it, because the game is a sandbox - their sandbox. ;)"
9/23/2014,"well said kaz. while we may all be at the mercy of what mood ccp are in on any given day we do have a valid point here. the rules aren't clear and players like algon should not be made to take pictures and fraps of their actions preemptively to defend themselves from possible bans. ccp pr department- pay attention to this post and respond. it looks and feels very much like you are trying to sweep this under the rug. unless you plan to ban entire alliances you should realize by now we are not going to leave this subject alone until we receive a logical response. respectfully, jazz."
9/23/2014,i would just like to point out that it is literally disgusting that this has gone on this long with no official gm/dev/csm response to this thread. certainly none of our current csm will be getting my vote at this point.
9/23/2014,"this has not been handled correctly at all, that rug at your hq must be getting real bumpy.this needs a clear ccp response, not the usual under the counter backdoor ""kept quiet for security reasons"" excuses.i don't envy the ccp reps at vegas when aglon gets there.salt"
9/23/2014,"i too find the lack of csm interest bothersome, even a ''hey, we see how this sucks''.aglon did what anyone else would do. titan was vulnerable due to pilot error, and he took the opportunity presented. this heavy handed banning is ridiculous, and should be addressed asap."
9/23/2014,"the way i see it, we have 2 major problems. i would like to address them separately.1- the rules regarding this bump are unclear. while ccp has announced that bumping ships inside a pos wiothout a password is bannable, this titan appears outside the pos. if a ship is considered inside a pos when it's model appears outside, then this needs to be clarified and the game mechanics need to be fixed. a perma ban for unenforced, unclear rules is absurd imho2- the enforcement of this rule is very biased the way i see it. this pilot has been perma banned yet in other recent titan pos bumping activities i have not heard of a single punishment. in ncdot's recent kill that seems to meet the same exploit criterea i have not heard of a single pilot being banned. if the rules are to be forced fairly, shouldn't every pilot who exploits be punished the same? if our tornado jockey stays banned but the entire ncdot titan fleet that performed a similar exploit go unbanned, i will see this as bob mk 1 era favoratism."
9/23/2014,"just curious is there a certain percentage of the ship that has to stick out of the shields to make it fair gain or can i just have it touch the shields for me to get crying right when it's get shot.also am i to understand that only npc ships can freely engage any target anywhere, or can i get the serpentis belt rats banned for harressment?maybe something silly but it seems to me that if you wish to change a certain behavior it helps to explain what it is you wish to change, not just ban and make a guessing game out of the reason."
9/23/2014,"that is what everyone is trying to convey to ccp, their ""official"" statement is:""bumping ships, that are located within password protected starbase force-fields, out of the force-field from outside without having the correct password or corporation/alliance permissions as configured in the tower settings, is considered an exploit.""1) please define ""within""2) do parts that hang out, that players can interact with as allowed by the game engine count as ""within""3) is it ""within"" if its not lockable, and ""outside"" if it is lockable?there is no clear definition that a player can use as a reference to know if he is playing in the ""sandbox"" the way ccp wants them to play. so in this case, a titan hanging out of the pos shield, which can be interacted with (and doesn't need a password) because on the client side its exposed, and bumpable, somehow falls under this rule? and gets a player perma banned... what a joke."
9/23/2014,"i agree with most of posters wrote above. the permanent ban is quite ridiculous and harsh, those reasons behind it is unclear. also this whole affair is kinda ruining 'sand-box' nature of this game. how can we create content in this game, if some developers or gms ban the actions of a capsuleer with unclear reasons?"
9/23/2014,there really needs to be some major clarification on what is an exploit and what is allowed when it comes to bumping at poss. the lack of consistency on these type of rulings is troubling.
9/23/2014,"hello space people!i am happy to announce that we have finished the summer summit for csm9!first things first: planned date to release the minutes is 31st of october, 2014. winter summit is happening in january, 2015. we are planning a few changes to the summit, for example, we are planning to add a few extra topics to the next summit as additional sessions were positively accepted this year, this is not confirmed yet, but because of this change the duration of the summit will probably increase by 1 day, making it 4 days in total.this time around, we had 29 sessions. csm members spent over 30 hours in our office over the course of the summit. feel free to ask any questions in this thread. - ccp leeloo"

9/24/2014,"i don't even know the pilot in question but i do have to agree with pretty much all the previous posters, the way the rules are being used arbitrarily to punish one pilot whereas another group used an obvious exploit yet none of their pilots were banned. i say revoke the permaban of aglon and there should be a recognized and set decision on what consists of legitimate and illegitimate bumping of ships within the region of a pos. otherwise arbitrary decisions like this may set a precedent that may lead to a mass exodus of all pilots who are not able to fly a titan because they see that they are treated as second class citizen compared to those who are able to. those who are able to seem to be viewed as somehow special and granted special powers it seems compared to the rest of us. they are able to light a cyno right next to a post and jump dozens of their ships in knowing that the game will cause some of them to spawn inside the shields before being ping ponged out and thus bowling a ship that is fully inside the shields out and suffering absolutely no punitive punishments whereas a player without a titan used a legal tactic to get a ship to move in a way that he wanted and yet he is permabanned. fix this ccp and make a clear statement to players and gms as to what is considered or is not considered an exploit."
9/24/2014,"5 days and no word publicly from ccp. only the original ban and the denial of the first reply to the ban.no word from the csm.the only info that we have in writing is that he was banned because the ship was not lockable. and not a single piece of published information that supports any exploit revolving around ships being lockable.i understand that we are a small insignificant corp, but this is completely unreasonable in any sense of the term. currently inside includes outside and banable offence only applies to small groups ""when the logs show nothing""."
9/24/2014,"everything i've read so far regarding pos bumping does not seem to apply to this situation. were the opportunity to present itself in this way again i think many people including myself even after hearing of this incident would take the same action. i agree with most of the other posts here that we need some actual clear information how to play your game ccp without getting the proverbial ban-hammer smack to the nuts. its got to be bad for business to have conflicting rules that can be loosly interpreted by a gm with the authority to drop the banhammer. in this situation it seems to have been done without much thought, and that is troubling. please explain."
9/24/2014,"this.so i suppose it's not the clarification we need, it's the clarification we deserve, meh. is it only me or ccp added more words to the notification, but haven't added any more information/sense?"
9/24/2014,"did you escalate your ticket to a senior gm? do it, if you haven't."
9/24/2014,"ccp you should be ashamed of yourselves. you built this game based on a sandbox and encouraged its players to think outside the box and find unique ways to kill eachother yet everytime we do and someone cries about it, it is now an exploit and you give some half assed excuse as to why you are nerfing or banning something.this pilot did what any of us would of done if the situation presented itself so you might as well ban all of us because its a stupid, half defined rule and goes against the spirit of the game itself.its time you guys remembered its the players that keeps this game going and money in your pockets so maybe you should show them a bit more care."
9/24/2014,"i would be interested to hear what the csm has to say on this absurd and inconsistent permanent ban, considering none of them have seen fit to post on the issue so far."
9/24/2014,same
9/24/2014,"first off: gm support tickets are considered private. releasing them is bannable, look at blink.personally i can agree that banning someone without a warning is hard for the people involved. even the titan pilot bumped expressed the hope that the ban woudl be temporarily.ccp is fixing in the next release bumping by cyno, and removing stuff from a pos withotu having the password, through which ever means. if u look at other incidents then there is a wide variation in interpretabel rules and actions. from banns, to reimbursting titans, to not doing stuff.i posted it internally th brign it under attention, but csm wont take a stand nor pick a side or order ccp nor a gm how to operate, especially not in single cases. we like to look at the mechanism itself and improve eve, so dont interpet my post as a, unbann him ffs.personally i hope ofc the pilot can enjoy eve again,goodluck all"
9/24/2014,"except this was not a case of bumping by cyno. this was a case of smashing a 100mn mwd tornado into a part of the ship fully exposed from the shield, and pointing it / cynoing in dreads well after fully out of the shield. the tactic has been used many times before.all tactics used during this operation will continue to work perfectly fine after the changes ccp are implementing in oceanus."
9/24/2014,"sounds like you didn't really read the post. algon was banned for bumping a titan outside of the pos shields. the titan was not lockable and he used a 100mn tornado to do it. the oceanus fixes do nothing for this. this form of bumping will still exist. the question was, the player was notified that if the ship is not lockable then it is in the pos. can someone please show me the rule, post, etc. that states this?that may have not be worded extremely well, however it gets the point across."
9/24/2014,gj csm
9/24/2014,not to mention the whole if its not lockable its in the pos thing is bullshit. if its sticking out of the shields it should be fair game.
9/24/2014,"and so the laziness and incompetence continues... all i can say is keep posting and supporting the issue, hopefully if we make enough noise about this ccp will actually take a look at the case and do the right thing.#freealgon"
9/24/2014,i am sure that with the upcoming patch ccp and the csm's have been more then busy with oceanus. i hope now that corebloodbrothers has brought it to attention with the csm we will see a swift response to this topic.
9/24/2014,"hopefully now after: a mittani.com article, an eve news 24 post with over 160 comments, and 2 reddit posts with over 100 comments each we are gaining some traction. please don't write us off with no response ccp- that would be very disappointing for a group that has, on average, invested 4 years into this game."
9/24/2014,"well i would like to thank a csm for making a reply. at least i know one of them is alive.as the debaters and politicians of eve debate over all of the debatable things, i would like to point out that my only question was ""is this titan fair to bump"". the overwhelming response from the community has been yes. but no word from ccp to clarify.the reason it was asked in this forum is that most of eve is under the impression the only real purpose of the csm is to voice major player community issues to ccp and help to resolve them. this is all i have asked for. i in no way expect the csm to be responsible for getting aglon unbanned.what i expect from the csm is to:1) confirm that aglon was banned for bumping this titan out of the pos shields in a manner a large portion of the community considers fair gameplay.2) provide the community with clear details of why it was illegal, where it is stated, and when it was posted. the previous postings that only state ""in a pos"" are unacceptable (since we understand this one to be out of the pos), unless detailed information is included that states what constitutes as ""in"" other than the obvious assumption of at least the model being 100% inside.if i unzip and have 5% of my thing poking through my zipper and grab it, is it in my pants or in my hand? most people would argue hand or both, not just pants.the arbitrary ban of aglon without questioning, proof, or even a stated policy to be broken, only indicates that ccp has no stable policy on customer relations. and i do not feel that any of us are surprised by that.i would assume that straightening out the clarification on the banable offence would either justify or reverse it."
9/24/2014,"not to mention assuming that the ban was legit, shouldnt ccp tell the person why with a cut and paste excerpt of the supposed rule be broke?perma banning someone is a big deal, take the time and explain to him why."
9/24/2014,keep the dream afloat folks. need this to stay toward the top for all to see.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.

9/24/2014,"the biggest problem with this discussion is one of its basic assumptions, that eve is a sandbox.eve is not, never was, and never will be a sandbox.when you played in a sandbox did some of the kids have sov guns keeping you at your side of the sandbox or at least out of theirs. did your sandbox have gigantic whs in it. did your sandbox have steps of security so that the playground monitor would ignore you pleas for help if you went into certain areas of your sandbox.eve is more like a paintball park, there is a fair amount of freedom to move around but both you and your enemies have places of 'cover' provided to you that function similarly to wh collapses, the division of space into security zones and of course sov (that protects your space even while you are at home eating moms spaghetti).as to local being an issue i distinctly remember being able to see everyone that entired or left the sandbox. so if we are going to pretend that eve even remotely resembles a sandbox then leaving local alone is an imperative.yawn, i'm right as usual. the predictability kinda gets boring really."
9/25/2014,"i certainly do appreciate that a csm member finally saw fit to comment on this. thank you. what i do not appreciate however is a comment that is blind and un-informed. clearly the csm member who did respond has no real understanding of how the titan was bumped, or what the circumstances were at all. since he sited a an upcoming change that would in no way have effected this situation were it in effect at the time. c'mon csm i really do expect more from you, and i think everyone else does as well. we are not asking you to pick sides, we are asking you to advocate for the player base who wants a clear resolution to this issue. i think you all should be able to handle that."
9/25/2014,yet another day passes... #freealgon
9/25/2014,"thanks for the reply corebloodbrothers and i am glad you can at least admit you personally find the ban excessive, we also much appreciate you raising it internally. hopefully you take on the responsibility of representing our interests in this matter and fight our corner as a csm for the greater good of the players who elected you."
9/25/2014,ccp should revoke the ban this is uncalled for and no why to treat your customers as no warning was given first to this players about this before hand
9/25/2014,"so let me get this straight.besides overcoming a huge learning curve, i am supposed to know about a list of rules that are scattered about various forums and dev blogs?that the rules are sometimes not very specific and can be interpreted differently depending on the person who happens to get the ticket.that the accused is asked no questions before being banned from the game.that there is a possibility ccp has no logs of the events? so the ban was based on what evidence? leading me to surmise that a person can be banned for simply being accused of something?that when asked for a clarification on a rule that can get you banned ccp chooses to completely ignore everyone.what is ccp afraid of? obviously something other than basic customer relations.i am now also unclear of exactly what the purpose of the csm is? the only one to reply in what seems to be days, was clearly afraid to support anything. but at least had the courage to be seen.unless i am completely wrong about what is going on."
9/25/2014,"so does it count as inside the shield when half of it is hanging out? does it count as inside if 1/4 of it is hanging out? does that apply if its lockable, or not, there needs to be a definite rule and line stated by ccp so there is no confusion. based on the screenshot there was a section of a titan hanging outside of the shield bubble that players could interact with, and the attempt was made, and was successful. had the rules been explained by ccp in more detail, for example: if it is lockable or not, players could rely on that to make the decisions on their actions - and this mess could have been avoided."
9/25/2014,"i wouldn't rule out that the pilot has other appeal-able offenses against him to receive the ban hammer. clarification would be appreciated though, from this new pilot perspective."
9/25/2014,senior gm said you have our previous response and closed the ticket
9/25/2014,=(
9/25/2014,"even if you don't expect the csm to be responsible for getting your pilot unbanned, you've still got a pretty wildly unrealistic idea of what the csm can or can't do as far as specific individual support cases go.just sayin'.in any case, while i don't really give a **** about your pilot as an individual case i am a wee bit concerned about what appears (edit for clarity: based on information that's come to me one way or another from other players) to be somewhat inconsistent handling of various titan bumping cases and am doing what i can in that regard. aglon happens to fall under that particular umbrella, so hey, maybe he'll get lucky, we'll see what happens."
9/25/2014,"i think it is time to step it up a notch or two, roll the twitter feeds and the forum posts. #freeaglon.what rubbish that the csm can't do anything about it what the hell were you voted in for. to be the players voice so do something about it. you guys are in constant contact with ccp. this ban is a bloody joke and any sane person know this. pull your fingers out."
9/25/2014,"on an extremely related note:if a titan poking out of a shield is not a valid bump target, then should it not follow that bridging capsuleers situated outside a pos shield with a titan that is unlockable is also on the list of no goes? this should be a bannable offense by association.i have been bridged in this manner before. members waiting to be bridged have accidentally bumped the titan. sadly, this did not result in a killmail, so obviously a ban wouldn't happen. but if a killmail did happen...who would get banned? the accidental bumper, or the people doing the killing? where precisely is the line?"
9/25/2014,"the day in and day out contact the csm has is with the development staff.that does not mean that nothing has been said, done, or brought up. it is that our normal daily communication pathways do not involve speaking with the gms about player bannings. this processes does not often have the speed those involved would like to see.there is also a question of clarity. there is a news article from june of 2013 about starbase force field ship bumping that states it is an exploit. this information is accessible but buried and these scattered rules and policies about the website and forums need cohesion. a central location of some sort. it is also why i am pointing out the policy but not saying, ""oh well"" because that policy is buried under almost a year and a half of information. i do not consider that reasonably accessible.i will also be at eve vegas."
9/25/2014,not empty quoting.
9/25/2014,"this article still does not answer the question that we are all asking. what the community is wanting to know is what the definition of ""inside a force field"". is it targetable, is it a certain percentage of the ship out, is it totally out of the shield. that is what the community wanting to know and what this thread is about. we all know that the csm doesn't having anything to do with that ban but we need clarification on what we are aloud to do in the game. we need to not be scared of what we are seeing/doing when we see a ship is exposed and not think back and ask ourselves ""are we going to get banned for this"". this game is about acting before thinking sometimes."
9/25/2014,"what everyone else but the csm folks here seem to not understand is that this is not limited to one case. this could happen again today. or tomorrow. noone knows definitively knows what the rules are in this scenario. so i think your particular umbrella could be catching some rain on this one. ' the purpose of the csm is to represent society interests to ccp. this requires active engagement with the player community to master eve issue awareness, understanding, and evaluation in the context of the greatest good for the greater player base.'you have 'access to an internal forum which only the csm and ccp staff have access to, where discussions regarding various topics can be brought up by either group in a less formal manner than the summits.' thanks for fighting for the little people at any rate. or not giving a **** like you say."
9/25/2014,"""the council of stellar management (csm) is a player-elected council to represent the views of the players to ccp."" ccp's definition not ours.the views of the players are being voiced so represent.ccp has a long history of being consistently inconsistent. this is just one small example of the type of inconsistency that causes the player base to ask that question....why i am paying for this again? this isn't ""bitter vet"" syndrome but just another example of the core player base of eve going ""huh?"" - zion"
9/25/2014,"its ok guys, we have consistently had low numbers logged in to eve for weeks. let ccp keep screwing us and maybe the game will die and we can all win eve together.seriously though, any pvper in this game worth his salt would of bumped that titan if it had its nose sticking out. id do it right now if the situation presented itself.for once in your life ccp, be clear on something."
9/25/2014,"thats ultimately why i feel so strongly about this - any one in this thread would of probably done it too given the opportunity - until now it has been completely acceptable, and we still have no official idea whether it is or not because of gm incompetence and their inability to publish clear guidelines. its like changing the speed limit on a road from 40 to 30, and the prosecuting the people who travelled at 40 before the change for speeding - it's just mind boggling stupid."
9/25/2014,"an interesting post from oni industries website (the corp that lost the titan - which has been reimbursed by ccp)it's in japanese but can easily be translated, it's a little broken but even they claim that indeed the nose of the titan was hanging out, after they had finished bridging a fleet. see link below (japanese), or the image for translation..."
9/25/2014,"i am glad a number of csm members have commented here. as you all may not be gms or have direct contact, you do have a louder voice to speak to the gms if you see that there is an issue that needs to be dealt with. hopefully the outcry from so many pilots and possible the support from a number of csm members will get ccp to re evaluate their actions."
9/25/2014,nobody is even talking about the possibility of the titan guy getting un-reimbursed :(
9/25/2014,"my perspective is it is really less about the reimbursement of the titan, and more about player interaction with ccp. one minute they take no action, the next minute it's a senior gm banning a player for something that was ok a few months ago? a player never knows from one minute to the next which side of the coin you are going to fall on as ccp never makes anything clear.flawed game mechanic and the guy gets his titan back? ok, whatever.ban a player because of the flawed mechanic suddenly because today was your day to have a bug up your butt about titan bumping? ok for some people to do and others not to do? silly.we all know we can go out and pick up another character but who knows what you'll do next that was ok yesterday that someone decides isn't ok today and you are back to square one. silly. - zion"
9/25/2014,ccp wont do that cause it will make them look like ****. but they can unban someone fairly easily.
9/25/2014,makes them look less bad than not doing it.
9/25/2014,"it is honestly just unfair treatment being displayed. simple as that, no questions about it. the csm probably think whatever they are currently doing is more important than this single pilots issue, but what they don't understand is what we have all been screaming about in here for a while now. this could (and probably will) happen again very soon. and players want to know the details of what will get you banned and what is fair game simple as that.so there are two options for ccp in my opinion: 1. clarify the rules well enough for even the newest players to understand it.or...2. make a statement to the players explaining why favoritism towards large nullsec groups is continually shown and allows players in those groups to play the game on a separate set of rules than others.simple enough i think. respectfully, jazz"

9/26/2014,"still waiting for a reply that actually answers the question. could we at least get an acknowledgement that you are even paying attention? something like, ""hey""."
9/26/2014,our player is still unfairly banned at this moment. at least half the people in this thread have played eve for 5 years and gone to fan fest.hundreds or thousands of dollars spent on plex an subscriptions and years of dedicated play and ccp bans someone on a whim. i sense a severe lack of empathy on the part of the game management department.
9/26/2014,"well we are already averaging 21,000 people online in us prime time as opposed to the usuall 35 to 40,000.keep ignoring your player base ccp. soon you wont have one."
9/26/2014,"absolutely stunning in the lack of communication, even when petitioned about the situation again.if you're not going to unban aglon, then you might as well start banning some titan pilots, and don't flap your gums about ''risk'' being the mitigating factor. that's almost as ridiculous as the permaban handed out here.clarity and even handedness, all we're asking for."

9/26/2014,hello!i have a proposal related to the recent dev blog:
9/26/2014,"hi csm,after last nights suggestion of changes coming to jump drives, i wanted to pitch an idea to you to see if it had already been discussed or to see if it is possible to discuss. when we introduced tiericide with ships (and now with modules!) one of the changes i like was separating the battlecruiser and destroyer skills into racial skills and i think the same could be done for jump drive skills. the basic premises would be to take the current skill, jump drive operation and break it into separate categories. this way you can make (or not make) changes to smaller groups of ships with jump drives as compared to trying to implement one change to rule them all. just as a rough suggestion:industrial jump drive operation for rorquals and jump freighterscovert jump drive operation for black opsoffensive jump drive operation for carriers/supers/dreadsalternatively, if you wanted to separate further:logistic jump drive operation for jump freighterscapital jump drive operation for carriers and dreadsadvanced capital jump drive operation for supers and dreadsthese don't necessarily have to be separate skills for pilots to train for, but rather as a means to reclassify all capitals based on their roles and how to go about making changes to them. it seems easier with the new release system for the devs to make changes to the jump drive of a rorqual (for example) without having to also make changes to supers and titans (and vice versa)anyway, just and idea. it'd be nice to get some feedback if possible.thanks"

9/27/2014,last i heard aglon is still banned and now after 4 or 5 years of playing he is going to unsubscribe his other two accounts. do they really hate their players this much.
9/27/2014,"before i begin, i'd like to address the gms and csm. i have the highest respect for the work you do and this post is not an attack on you. the post represents my honest opinions, free of metagaming, roleplay or trolling, to address what i see as a process issue for the community and for the gms. i hope you will take it in the spirit intended and allow the thread to run its course.to the community: i am well aware that the eula/tos gives ccp the right to ban any individual for any reason. i trust by the end of your reading you will see why this is not relevant to my post. i am quite happy to debate the post, but please refrain from using strawman arguments.backgroundthe issue of bans has been highly visible lately. i do not wish to discuss any specific bans, nor am i campaigning on behalf of any individual or group. however i have observed a number of things about the process - such as is visible from the outside - which concern me as a fair-minded player, and this post constitutes a proposal to evaluate and reform the ban process itself.i accept that the ban process is necessarily opaque. for any number of reasons, i can see why ccp would not wish to expose the inner workings or deliberations of their decision making process. as such, all we can do as a community is trust that ccp's internal ban process is fair, objective, proportional, evidence-driven and insulated from improper influence. unfortunately, for the first time in over ten years of playing eve, i have been given reason to doubt that this year.as a manager irl, i understand the importance of setting standards and evaluating people against those standards. i understand the need for a system of warnings before disciplinary action is taken; not because it is the law, but because it is the right thing to do, especially in cases where there are no clear standards. inconsistent and arbitrary discipline, the continual invention and revision of rules, ignorance of precedent, and nepotism/favouritism are extremely destructive to a working environment, and just as destructive to an online community. should these traits creep into ccp's processes - and there is some worry that some may be - i am certain that ccp would share the community's concern.now you may argue that rl hrm has no bearing on spaceships, and accuse me of trying to space-lawyer. this really isn't the case. i am not talking about rights and obligations, i am talking about basic fairness and the benefit of the doubt. in that context, the things that destroy a workplace are the same things that destroy a community; and for that reason ccp's universal right-to-ban - while acknowledged - is not relevant to the discussion.a responsible ban processi believe that a responsible ban process should have the following qualities:- it should be incremental and proportional; i.e. offenders should be given a chance to correct their behaviour, warnings and temp bans should be the norm and permabans should only be used in the case of repeat, incorrigible, intentional offence;- it should be consistent, objective and evidence-driven; i.e. gm and ccp precedent should be considered, evidence and only evidence (e.g. ignoring community/celebrity pressure) should form the basis of the decision, and guilt-by-association (including ip/hardware bans which affect family members) should be eliminated;- it should be subject to internal review and include checks and balances; i.e. no single gm should be permitted to make a permaban decision, petitions regarding any ban should be escalated to a senior and different gm from the gm who issued the ban, and internal affairs should review the evidence on permabans for impropriety.it would be very worthwhile for anyone interested in the issue to review the success achieved by riot games in this area, as covered on wired:"
9/27/2014,"proposaltl;dr: the proposal to evaluate and reform the ban process is:a) that the csm work with ccp internal affairs to evaluate and, if necessary, reform the ban process to ensure that it is fair, incremental, objective, proportional, evidence-driven and insulated from improper influence; and that the csm and ccp ia jointly release a statement once they believe that state is reached;b) that any permabans which receive a petition after the reform be reviewed in line with the reformed ban process; andc) that ccp help their community understand what is unacceptable behaviour by publishing anonymised and generalised details of offences that lead to bans.thank you for your time."
9/27/2014,reserved
9/27/2014,"i know you are mainly focused on the 'harassment' bans and ignoring the rmt and botting ones but in relation to those too much information will allow subsequent fiends to capitalize on the intel gathered by their predecessors. in regards to a jury of two rather than one, a second opinion on permabans. not bad. but what if they differ? a third to break the tie?are you willing to add a caveat that some infractions are so blatant that incremental banning just extends the time that the infraction takes place or adds to a the number of victims and so there does need to be a reasonable case load that are permabanned right off?as a last thing. up until now the csm has been at arms length from enforcement of bans. policy we might advise on if asked but for the most part that is not part of our raison d'etre. as 'private citizens' we may yell and scream and point fingers like any other player. that is our right. but we have no say in the enforcement or punishment although high profile cases may be swung past us more from the 'how will the community react' rather than us in powdered wigs yelling 'off with his head'.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
9/27/2014,"i wouldn't say that my focus is mainly on the harassment bans mike, though certainly those are the cases that caused me the most recent concern. i can understand your point about rmt and botting details, and of course there is no expectation that details that aided future botters should be shared, but my focus is on helping people avoid fairly implemented bans so there is some value in logging some detail, even if it needs to be pretty vague for opsec.re tiebreakers, i would think that a 50/50 opinion on a ban strongly indicates that it needs further thought. but ultimately my concern is that permabans could be issued unilaterally. anything > 1 is an improvement.the problem with ""blatant infractions"" is that it is still a subjective judgement. as an effective ""death penalty"" for a player and all their accounts (and, as implemented, anyone on their ip address or shared hardware), i would think that in the case of a person with no previous warnings or temp bans for a related offence, and especially if the offence was unprecedented, a permaban would almost never be an appropriate first step; and certainly not if implemented unilaterally without impartial appeal. i've no expectation that csm would get involved in the assessment of bans. this is purely a question of process and policy, and it seems appropriate that the community's representatives simply put their heads together with ccp's impartial ia to assess and reform a process which potentially has significant impact on players.thanks for taking the time."
9/27/2014,fair and square - i have never seen any other game that lets their player act as freely as they can act already in eve. the borders between 'accepted' behaviour and 'ban-able' actions might not be very obvious whitout digging into details - but i do not believe that there is a huge need for that actually. you mention different cultures and morales as an argument of your defense - its the individuals responsibility to adjust to the others and not the other way around. when i enter someone's home its up to me to act in a way that fits to my hosts expectation and not the other way around.testing borders is a typical behaviour of children and teenagers to learn and develop their character. in eve we are dealing with a large group of adults being capable of testing on a completely different level. i do understand that ccps policy is not a public one and wouldnt wish it any other way - giving those adults even more tools at hand will not improve anything.
9/27/2014,well said
9/27/2014,what.
9/27/2014,tl;dri am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
9/27/2014,"op fundamentally misunderstands the problems behind ship painting from an engineering/coding perspective (which, to be fair, i'm still sort of fuzzy on too).because rigs do not affect the actual ship model. paintjobs do. that is why the current coding architecture requires a unique hull for each paintjob.what the dev blog was attempting to explain was that they are trying to revise the code so that it will reduce clutter on the ""backend""... which will maybe allow them to make more improvements in the future (which they are not saying because most probably they are still not sure which ones they want to focus on and/or are even feasible).edit: and before you say ""well, why would ccp ever do such a thing, that is ****** programming"" allow me to enlighten you on something i have painfully learned from working as an accountant; anything you design now can make perfect sense because it fulfills your needs at the time in the most elegant way... but years in the future, when needs change, some poor sob is going to look at it all and wonder wtf you were thinking when you did it and try to ""improve"" it without breaking anything else that still works (and is needed)... and the cycle will forever repeat."
9/27/2014,"please consider rattlesnake example like this.now:model/ship/caldari/battleship/cb2/guristas/cb2_t1_guristas.redccp plan:model/ship/caldari/battleship/cb2_t1:guristas:caldarihow it could be:model/ship/caldari/battleship/cb2_t1:[any painting model]:caldariits that simple.i've postet the idea with something like rigs slots becouse they cant be reused, and i'm sure this is essential attribute for paintings.and about affecting a model in space... we do have t3 cruisers already with 5 modules affecting the ship model in space."
9/27/2014,"the point behind the sof is to make customization easier.until /very/ recently, every ship variation was a different model, with a different skin. that's how the system worked. you couldn't just have a new ship type by going 'use this skin'.the sof is designed to have one base model per ship type, and be able to apply customizations to that."
9/27/2014,"and the point is to allow sof to read ""ship type""+""skin"" (base or ""fitted"") and get rid of blueprints that makes everything unclear.nowadays blueprints makes new hull types just for painting and it's a bad thing. it leads nowhere."
9/27/2014,"agreed. the current system isn't very good. but right now the code is the problem (which, again, the dev blog explains why and that they are working on it). you may think it is ""simple"" to alter the code... but personal experience with databases and formulas has taught me otherwise. nothing is ever that simple.case and point: when the visible waypoint route was added to eve, it was intended to be a purely graphical addition (i.e. you could see what stars you are going to without using the map). when it was released it borked the autopilot system and automatically set everything to ""shortest route."" it took more than a week to find and fix the problem. meanwhile, many freighters were killed."
9/27/2014,the current system is nothing but a prototype. it's not going to stay that way. it's to see if there's a suitable appetite for ship skins.

9/28/2014,"i spent the last 20 minutes reading this entire thread [and the evenews24 article], and i'm at a loss for words it's a shame to see that even after a passionate outcry from a community that seems to care alot about their game, that the developer doesn't not even bother to respond to topic which obviously alot of people have vested interest in. an unfortunate display from ccp's side, a true shame that a wonderful game is tainted by a lack of community relations from the developers side."
9/28/2014,"if you can't control your titan you should get relieved of it. next up everyones gonna store en in a small pos because you can't lock it.unban the man ccp. you won't lose face anyways, there isnt any left.edit:what happens if a fleet member bumps a titan before bridging. same thing if you ask me so ban them as well?"
9/28/2014,"i'm a little disappointed to come back to this thread and not see a response yet -.- it has been 8 days. i thought there might be a 'working on this issue' or some kind of feedback that maybe this situation is getting a second look. or a response shutting this down and saying it is not getting another look. i don't think in any way that the ban is going to deter someone from attempting this again if the situation presented itself because still no one knows what the rules are. please respond. respectfully, deuc"
9/28/2014,"this is going to sound like a broken record, but i am not going to stop until something is done. ccp please, it isn't funny, it isn't a joke. you are literally spitting in the face of every lowsec alliance, corp, and pilot and showing us that we are all worthless to you. we are your customers. we pay subscription fees. we need you to actually look at and respond to this in a serious and meaningful manner. according to the policy that you yourself laid out, aglon should not be banned. it makes me question whether or not i want to continue giving you my money. thus far you have been detestable, both in your lack of clarification and your lack of response and attention. ccp, you must realize the damage that you are causing here, please, please fix this."
9/28/2014,yep... pretty much this^
9/28/2014,"ccp,this decision you made to permaban aglon is based on flawed logic. what you deem as an exploit is in fact a spatial mechanic that your game allows for. your coding/programming allows for ships to be 'bumped' which extend past the safety of a pos shield. if a pilot doesn't want to be bumped, all he/she has to do is 'not' exit the pos shield. pretty straight forward.your ban hammer is misplaced and is a terrible precedent to set for the game at large. i am not a political animal, i don't hang around the forums. this is by choice. so in the two years i have played this game, if i do not know something is an exploit, would you ban me if i did it? if all i did was bump a ship that is bumpable because your coding is flawed? effectively that's what you have done. you have banned someone for doing something the game allows by its nature. if you don't want people bumping ships outside of a pos shield, then put code into the game that prevents it. instead, you made aglon your programmers' scapegoat. rather than have your own staff held accountable to fix the real issue, you blame the players for doing what the game allows in its current state.you have also changed the face of pos warfare with this decision. people will be afraid to bump ships that 'are' lockable, which is a legal mechanic per your recent statements, because maybe at the instant the bump occurs, the ship is now far enough back inside the shield that it is no longer lockable. is that ban worthy?what if enterprising corps put a fleet of capitals on the pos edge, half lockable, half not, but able to pop out on a moment's notice. if you bump the lockable ones, the unlockable ones get bumped too. is that ban worthy?rather than have your players' creativity stymied, fix your frigging code. then no one (not you, not the players) has to worry about it. and for goodness sake, unban aglon. he should not be held accountable because of the game's inherent programming flaws. if you want to reimburse the titan, sure whatevs. but the permaban is unreasonable, not warranted, and masks the real underlying issue.-d"
9/28/2014,"isboxer gives the user an advantage comparable to the advantage given by a bot. for example, a player could not normally play 20 eve accounts at once. the player would have to either be botting, or using isboxer.this no doubt gives the player a huge edge in this competitive game. to have the combined income of 20 players is a huge advantage.what other ways is isboxer unfair on normal players? some players have isboxed pvp fleets, bombers, and gankers, but these are the least of the problems. the worst of it comes from the economic damage, and the taking of content that was designed for an average certain number of players. i'm talking of course about mining anomalies.the problem has gotten so out of hand that you'll be lucky to find a mining anomaly system that doesn't have an isboxer fleet show up at every spawn. or in the worst cases, there is 4 or 5 different isboxed fleets. just take a look in osmon or wuos ice anomalies and see for yourself. there is sometimes can be up to a hundred mining ships present, but most of them are controlled by just a few isboxer players.isboxer users have the same detrimental effect on eve as botters. botting is not allowed for a few reasons.bots take content from normal playersbots probably pay for their accounts with plexbots have an unfair advantage of being able to earn more isk than players who don't buy the software (with exceptions)isboxers take content from normal playersisboxers probably pay for their accounts with plexisboxers have an unfair advantage of being able to earn more isk than players who don't buy the software (with exceptions)you don't see anomalies full of bots nor do you see constant complaints about them. and yet you do see anomalies full of isboxers and there is a steady yet constant stream of complaints.so while technically isboxer is not botting - it is infact at least as bad as botting.sure if you want to get technical the technical they are slightly different, but the effects in eve on the players are exactly the same and that should be what matters to ccp, not some technicality."
9/28/2014,"no. the reason mining anomalies are mined quickly is because ccp changed how they are found. you no longer need to scan for them, so everyone and his dog can find them. ccp even made finding them automatic.the ice anomalies are also too static and predictable.and?it costs more rl money to plex an account than subscribe.(amazon offers aside). the difference is in who pays the money. ccp gets more money when people plex than if they subbed.no. each account accumulates isk/resources at the same rate as any other account can. 20 miner accounts controlled by isboxer will mine 20 times the amount of ice as 1 miner can. (assuming they have the same skills and receiving the same boosts)i think this is what you really wanted to say. isboxer should be banned simply because i don't like it."
9/28/2014,i'd take the time to write a serious reply if literally everything you said was not hilariously wrong.
9/28/2014,this discussion only shows how ample ccp are at moderating their game. ccp gms need more pssssh
9/28/2014,"while large multibox fleets are not currently a real issue due to the seldom nature of their occurrence, in theory a game filled with these sorts of players could in fact be a problem.the solution is not to ban them, as it would be virtually impossible to do so. one person using 4 computers with 4 clients each would be indistinguishable from a few roommates playing the game each with alts logged in. let alone internet cafes.the solution in fact comes from reviewing the problems associated with running multiboxed characters. if you watch the youtube videos of these fleets in action, you will notice that many times commands do not go through to all the clients. you will also notice that moving around in sub-warp speeds is extremely difficult. lastly, it is overwhelming to manage the fleet when people mess with key components of it; the anchor for instance.this means multibox fleets are largely reserved to mining, incursions, suicide ganking, smartbombing, and quick bombing runs. to a lesser extent, capital ship warfare. even trying to multibox an l4 is very difficult due to the necessity to travel to jump gates and get in range of rats 100km away. incursions are warp in, blap, warp out, which is why the multibox fleets are effective there.most importantly, large scale industrial fleets of this size are extremely difficult to protect without concord intervention. this is why they tend to dock up immediately when outside high-sec, instead of staying and fighting despite their superior numbers.and so, the solution is as follows:- redesign mining to be less static and for changes to occur on a per-client basis, forcing the fleets to have to move around more often and micromanage each client too.- redesign incursions so they can never be completed by just warping in, locking targets as they approach, and blapping them.- redesign rewards in low-sec to be significantly more valuable, and/or nerf rewards in high-sec. this will allow non-multibox users to reap the benefits of engaging in industry in low sec, where most multiboxers dare not go."
9/28/2014,glad to see the csm has the good sense not to listen to this silliness . what a waste of their time. there is nothing wrong with isboxer and the eula no matter how many accounts you control with it. thinking otherwise just makes you look uninformed.
9/28/2014,there is plenty wrong with it.
9/28/2014,please inform me. you've got to use some new stuff though because everything you mentioned in this thread so far doesn't cut it.
9/28/2014,"considering the stuff i mentioned does cut it, but everyone is in denial, i shall not."
9/28/2014,i see. so just so i'm clear on it. you think ccp is in denial over their own eula? interesting.
9/28/2014,"throughout the not-so-vast time that players have been discussing multiboxing in various mmos, there is a typical trend that always seems to appear. you'll have a side that provides actual arguments and reasoning behind their position, and the other side will just say ""nuh uh, its cheating cause (insert refuted argument here)."" this thread is a prime example of just that, and a search will yield you more of the same.all in all, a good laugh"
9/28/2014,"i'll add my support for the op too. if you review my posts, you will even see i very much so speak out against ts harassment and all forms of tear extraction. i think it takes a very sad individual to come onto a video game and attempt to upset another player for the purpose of their own entertainment. this means i have a problem with probably hundreds if not thousands of eve players, and yet i agree with op.why? because ccp seems to be a very disorganized company. having submitted petitions on various things - from reimbursement to being doxxed when i was a new player - has really shown to me the completely arbitrary nature of how each problem is resolved. just recently i reported someone for using a homophobic slur in his bio. my petition was closed, and his bio was left unchanged for more than 2 weeks. i submitted the petition again, a different gm responded, and the players bio was changed within the day.these sorts of occurrences have been reported by many players, where they submit the same petition on different characters and get completely different results based on the gm who's responded.arbitrary decision making is simply wrong, and yet it is the cornerstone of eve customer service. the way to change that is to involve more gms in the decision to ban players.lastly, there is the nature of second chances. if themittani can decide, while sober, to make a powerpoint presentation that completely humiliates a player, decide to fly that over to iceland, decide to use his time on stage to present it, decide to tell players to help urge him to commit suicide... and get a one month ban.... there is very, very little anyone else can do that deserved a permaban on the first infraction. but hey, that's arbitrary decision making for ya."
9/28/2014,i appreciate the support steppa. one thing: it's best if we avoid discussing specific bans as that would be a good excuse to lock the thread and i'd rather not have that happen.
9/28/2014,"i can't agree with this. although i think the csm are a valuable asset to the game they are players and can be seen by people who dislike their corp or alliance or playstyle as being inherently biased although i think that is unfair and they should be judged on their merits. if csm were to be involved in internal decisions on bans it would just create even more accusations of favouritism and i doubt any of the csm would want to take that sort of responsibility anyhow.also, consider james' article on the recent bans on the mittani.com where he lists previous csm delegates that have been banned themselves for one reason or another."
9/28/2014,"voetius, could you re-read what you're disagreeing with? the proposal is for the csm to review the ban *process*, and i explicitly said they should not be involved in specific bans where biases could come into play."
9/28/2014,"i've stated publicly on my show that the recent trend of instant perma bans for just about any offense lately seems to be harsh and a detachment from how things were previously. perma bans should be reserved for habitual offenders and extreme cases, while temp bans used to help correct player behavior. in short, i agree with your proposal, however the csm is left out of the ban process for the most part, and i'm not sure how effective we'll be on this. i have been advocating for it though."
9/28/2014,
9/29/2014,"no offence to ccp, this reminds me of a joke i heard a while back. how many dev's does it take to fix a toaster? one to say it not broken, one to say it is broken and they will fix it soon, one to work on developing an action plan to fix the toaster. one to yell at the other devs for not getting the action plan together fast enough, one to actually fix the toaster, one to write a release about the fixed toaster, and one to actually release the fixed toaster into the game. then all the ccp devs gather round and wonder how the players managed to make the toaster turn on a light bulb. only in this case, one player turning on the light bulb gets permabanned, as the rest tentatively turn the lights on and off. ccp needs to respond to this, they need to unban the player in question. and most of all if this is an exploit, they need to make an official statement about it, and fix their mistake.#deletetheweak"
9/29/2014,"@ccp, you really need to make an open clarification about this issue. there is still no official statement about bumping a ship that is partiality outside of the pos shields. we all accept that deliberately exploiting the server mechanics to get a ship in"
9/29/2014,"ccp your lack of action on this post speaks loudly to many players. people have invested many years and dollars into this game myself included. does each player now need to be worry about set of changing rules? shall there be a daily post of what is and is not acceptable that day? this kind of attitude to the smaller low sec community is disconcerting to me. in the grand picture we are just a small part of the picture of eve, not even worth taking some time away from your day to day tasks. it angers me that you will not even acknowledge our voice. we are the little kid throwing a temper tantrum at the mall in your eyes. just ignore him and he will calm down the parents say. why should i continue to invest time and money if the scenario comes up i am going to be guilty until proven innocent. #freeaglon"
9/29/2014,"i'm quickly running out of the patience required to keep pouring money into a game where i may be arbitrarily banned for undefined reasons. this is impacting our alliances playstyle, and forcing us to second guess any engagements that occur in or around the edge of a pos shield, which is a sizeable part of our content. the lowsec community is requesting a response from ccp on this thread and it's subject matter. this issue needs to be fully clarified.#freeaglon"
9/29/2014,"ships that come out of stations are unlockable and yet bumpable, as are ships that land just outside of docking range and have their warp-in immunity before they move. titans are big ships, if someone stupid leaves a large amount of it outside a shield then its very bumpable, lockable or not.this ban and reimbursement is a massive steaming pile and both should be reversed.from the past decade lack of any word from ccp usually means they know they did something stupid and are trying to think of a way out of it by doing something else stupid."
9/29/2014,"and so another day passes, as the alliances and coalitions of nullsec continue to play the game without a care. we here in lowsec continue to stand up for each other and wonder if we will be banned for what used to be one of the most enjoyable and fulfilling endeavours a solo lowsec pilot could embark upon.#freealgon"
9/29/2014,"it's almost always this. oh, how the big bad isboxer took all your precious highsec ice. not that the isboxer did violence to your boat, but that he interrupted your afk highsec isk printing machine.here's a news flash. it is stupidly easy to run 20 accounts to mine pretty much anything. due to the mind numbing nature involved with pretty much every kind of mining, it would take running 20 accounts to make a challenge out of it. i would know. i had the misfortune to have spent most of the last 7 years in this game as a miner, though most of that was spent in nullsec."
9/29/2014,"could not read a lot fo the stuff here so i skimmed most of it or skipped pages past page 3.not sure about pvp........but consider the atitude of ganking and ice fields...(since i believe that is the actual problem/insult being felt)i dont mine ice so lets make a hypthetical ice field like the anoms.....12 ice rocks....maybe 400 pieces of ice each.now lets say each procurer can get 5 pieces per cycle.........40 isboxer fleet = 200 pieces per cycle1 non isboxer = 5 pieces per cyclethe 1 non isboxer will get his 5....in the time it takes the isboxer fleet to get its 195 per rockso 195x12 = 2,340 pieces of ice for the isboxer fleetandthe non isboxer will get 60 pieces of ice.then have to wait another 4 hrs for the ice field to spawn again..............i see a problem with this as the non isboxers are gaining ice/isk much more slowly to the isboxer fleet idea. eventually they are forced to give up to find other ways to plex or run their industry....as in fuel block production...or collecting fuel for jump drives.this i believe it the heart of the matter for those that truly wish to ban isboxer.....because it is an unfair advantage."
9/29/2014,explain how each single pilot is unfairly gaining more product per cycle than other characters.
9/29/2014,"please dont quote me and try to interject something into my mouth that i did not say....it was just a theory upon why some might want to ban isboxer.but anyway heres go....lets expan on this theory and then after this take your simply mind pull out a calculator and do the work yourself.spawn = every 4 hrs. dt-dt = roughly 24 hrs expect on major patch days...then its more like 23.5 to23.75 hrsso 6 spawns per day x 2,340 = 14,040 (isboxer)6 spawns per day x 60 = 360 (the single guy)both assuming this all they do every day all day long14,040x30 days = 421,200 360 x 30 = 10,800now lets say avg price is 275,000 isk per piece421,200x275,000= 115,830,000,000 isk or 147.55 plex (figured at 785 million isk per plex)10,800 x 275,000 = 2,970,000,000 or 3.783 plexnow lets take a 3 month(yearly qtr) into account147.55 x 3 = 442.65 - (40x3) = 322.653.783x3 = 11.349 - 3 = 8.349at this rate you can see the difference is astounding in terms of wealth....now expand on the problem even more......maybe like most of them the single pilot doesnt have all day nor every day to mine the ice......so on avg its probably more like 5-15 pieces of ice per day 3 times a week because competing with the isboxer fleet is too difficult.so lets take 10x3 = 30 x 10 = 300 pieces of ice275,000 x 300 = 82,500,000..........oh wow not even enough to plex......the first month is a bust....2 weeks into the 2nd month the non-isboxer says screw this i have to do something else because i can no longer make isk or keep my business operating this way.botting and rmt was the measure of having botting fleets mining all day every day..........allowing isboxer gives the botters a different and legit way to do the same thing without really having to change how they conduct rmt bussiness. they still push the little guy whom is the one that wants to play a game.....not trying to make rl money off it."
9/29/2014,out of all the things in eve do we really need to make moving battleships in high sec a priority? why are you constantly moving battleships? in what scenario do you need to move 3 battleships every day?

9/29/2014,"100% support in reforming the banning policy/procedures. having had one of my buddies banned out of the blue, there is definitely a problem"
9/29/2014,"i've read the available articles about the most recent wave of permabans. whether or not a permaban was too harsh or the right punishment is irrelevant when you consider the following.in james 315's article published on tmc, it was stated that the appeals to the bans were summarily denied by the same person that issued the bans. this is what most concerned me, for not even in the screwed up buy-your-way-out-of-prison system the united states has does an appeal to a decision go before the same judge that issued said decision."
9/29/2014,"while not bans specifically, the csm does have a history of representing community concerns related to the gm department and it's processes (petitions, internal communication, etc) directly to the gm staff at the summit.wouldn't be out of left field for you guys to play a role here."
9/29/2014,agree there needs to be some reform in the perma ban process. there is a trend developing of just insta-perma-ban hammer and then ask questions later. this silliness needs to be addressed. - zion
9/29/2014,"nice post.good luck with it.i may be a bit tired and jaded with my arguments for the past week+ that have resulted in only circular debates from people unable or unwilling to deal with it.step 1 for any reform would require ccp to treat this game as a business instead of a popularity contest, but i guess the evil that they have created rules the game now. it has been working well for them for 12 years so what do i know.right?"
9/29/2014,"the ""correcting player behavior"" part is the most important bit.how can anyone know if they are breaking the invisible rules unless they get a ""hey, knock of xyz"" warning from a gm? a perma ban out of nowhere should never happen to anyone but a botter or an rmt'er, as those are actually spelled out as warranting a perma ban."
9/29/2014,"ironically this is the same gm, who holds a leadership position within the gm team, that has made such declarations as ""telling people that your alt is you will get you banned"". i'm honestly shocked that this individual still retains his leadership position when he is clearly unsuitable for the job. the fact that he personally reviews the appeals of unwarranted bans that he dished out in the first place should be another nail in the coffin."
9/29/2014,"malcanis on the erotica1 bans. i liked hearing this at the time:ofc aleks was also csm then so i'll guess this is what he was on about?i like the idea of csm being allowed a look into this whole deal. there's rumours that some people might've been banned that shouldn't've, there's talk that people aren't being told why they've been banned. it's impossible for me or other players to know what's true, but the csm has the nda, so i'd hope ccp is comfortable talking to them about this. i trust the csm as a group"
9/29/2014,"it's hard to ask the gms about rules, too. i wanted to know about a rule regarding concord exploits. i filed a petition under the correct category, had it moved to 'game questions', and was told they couldn't answer (i believe the idea is that if they tell people the rules, people will try to exploit loopholes)i did eventually get a satisfactory answer, but it was difficult communicating, and i think many people'd be turned off by the initial response of 'we won't tell you'i think it'd be ok if the gms said 'this is the rule, but there are guidelines here, too, and if you try to find loopholes or maliciously go outside the guidelines, you will be investigated and suffer punishment anyway'"
9/29/2014,"the last time i asked a gm for a clarification on something, my market account got a warning for putting up lowball buy orders in osmon and other sisters systems. apparently it constitutes ""taking advantage of new players"".since then, i have stopped asking. clear rules are vital, to keep inconsistency and personal bias from intruding."
9/29/2014,thank you for taking the time to write this out. clarity of policy and process in the past and future is a goal well worth pursing.
9/29/2014,"i think one important thing to come from this discussion is an overall clarity of how the gm process works in terms of banning. not necessarily what is considered 'ok' and 'not ok' in every single situation but a clear idea of what steps are taken each time gms are involved in a potential situation.also, when a situation does arise and gms or devs feel the need to go public and state 'hey guys - this is an exploit, don't do it' - those should be collated in somewhere easily located and searchable for any player. anyway, good post huey. i'll track you down on bstn comms to discuss further ;)"
9/29/2014,"this absolutely should be a thing, in the case benny is referring to there is a clear and explicitly defined answer from a gm on concord manipulation and what will/wouldn't warrant a ban buried deep in a locked threadnought.now without prior knowledge of it and the gm in questions name that is going to be effectively impossible to find.so yes +1 for this thing in particular."

9/30/2014,"pretty easy here, if you cannot lock the ship its in the sheild. if you were obnoxious enough to bump it out and someone got banned, well, ban earned.blowing up on twitter about something because you can't get an exact case answer for semantics is a useless and annoying behavior because someone was punished.if you can't lock it, you're not supposed to. bumping is allowed for things like lockable targets, to-from stations, gates, etc. if its inside a pos, enjoy the ban."
9/30/2014,"but titan bowling is alright yeah?also, there is so much wrong with this comment i can't even bear it."
9/30/2014,did you know you can bump ships on gates stations that are not lockable? and the model of the titan was half way outside pos shields.
9/30/2014,double post
9/30/2014,still waiting for a response.
9/30/2014,is there actually any way to kill a pos titan now?
9/30/2014,"assuming 'lockable/not lockable' is the transitioning condition, which is the clarification we are requesting- get the password, bump him out, or have a spy do it- wait for him to screw up and poke out the shields enough to lock him, then bump him out- kill the pos and hope it's not stronted- rf/kill the pos and the storage array housing the titan- rf/kill the pos with the titan logged out, and setup a hic login trap for itwould be the only options i can envision."
9/30/2014,so basically no
9/30/2014,apparently some people are allowed to bump them out. we won't really know because no one seems to want to address the question. - zion
9/30/2014,unless you're part of a null blob. then all bets are off.

9/30/2014,perhaps it is because of the new cloaking effect from oceanus preventing ccp from seeing it. seriously though i am hoping it may have something to do with a new release and they are busier than usual.
9/30/2014,"i see why you are confused. here is how it breaks down.each individual character isboxed or not still makes the same amount of isk that it could if it were being controlled by a single player. if each individual character could make isk faster than they normally would while it is still being controlled by a real person, or with nobody at the computer at all, then that is what would break the rules. since none of that is happening then there is no foul (outside of some people's uninformed brains). by your same logic anyone contributing anything at all to a corporation should also be banned. i have participated in corp fleets of non-isboxers that clear entire belts in minutes. since that can't be done by a single character then you may as well argue that they are using their numbers and cooperation to give themselves an unfair advantage.all isboxing does is eliminate the derp (somewhat) from fleet ops. anyone that has ever fc'd can tell you that attempting to coordinate a group of eve players is like trying to herd cats into the back of a moving pickup truck.also i isbox quite often and have never participated in rmt nor will i. so leave me out of your ridiculous ""isboxers = rmt"" bullcrap. thanks."
9/30/2014,"sigh...im sorry par'gellen.......but again like i said to the last guy at one point............what i wrote......is a theory based scenario on why the reasoning behind those that wish isboxer to be banned.and thats it............i mean ffs people, i dont care about your ice, i dont care about your pvp(other than the fact it makes me isk every time you blow stuff up). at one point i saw an underlying question to explain the reasons for banning isboxer.....so i answered the question by pointing out how the pro-banners are thinking. other than that...it means squat. and if your point out the fact of being apart from fleet ops....not being part of a corp or at least a community thing and just wanking off in the corner by yourself..........well you deserve to be blown up, you deserve to have no friends in eve, you deserve to be ganked.....maybe you should go back to wow or whatever other game you came from because this is not the place for you.and i have fc'd before, and your explanation of that is pretty apt....up till the point you start kicking your mewling peeps out or shooting them yourself for being a carebear too much."
9/30/2014,your apology turned into a senseless rant that i quickly failed to follow. apparently i play too much wow. or something...
9/30/2014,"wasn't an apology....as what i got from this part of your reply was that you do not like playing as fully valued member of the community but would rather simply supercede others that may or may not be able to compete with you. it seems you were saying....'i dont a corp', 'i dont need an alliance', and 'have no reason to be concerned with overall health of the game in general'and so my response was not an apology.....but the parts directed at you....were basically yeah stfu your not worth much more than the km someone gets for taking out your ships....not because you isbox...but because your attitude with it is indifferent to the long term health of the community"
9/30/2014,"usually when someone starts a post with ""sigh...im sorry such and so......."" it has a strange way of looking like an apology. your interpretation of my earlier post is interesting. completely, utterly, and totally wrong, but interesting. you attack aspects of the way i play and then when that fails you attack me personally. how's that working out for you? feel better?some people's kids..."
9/30/2014,"also, loot pinata.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
9/30/2014,can i have cybersex with that ?
9/30/2014,"this would require some consistency from ccp, which is not their wheel house. they prefer to bury it in the ""sand box"". - zion"
9/30/2014,"a new use for ples would increase plex prices convincing more people to buy more plex to sell due to higher prices as people get more isk for their money, while making other people that have eve has one of their few games and rely on plex as their money goes to other necessities while still maintaining on of the few outlets of entrainment."
9/30/2014,"you're correct that the space object factory is an incremental step that doesn't get all the way to enabling what you describe. however, it will make further steps toward that goal much easier.when discussing possible ship customization features, please keep in mind that the details of low-level implementation (which is where space object factory sits) need not drive the design for such a feature that you'd see as a player. that player-side experience would be planned out and designed by game designers to make sense to you.so, when you ask for how you'd like that experience to look, don't get too hung up on what's been revealed about the innards of the eve graphics engine. the engine can evolve to support what the feature needs, rather than the other way around.i'd be surprised if the designers would want to make you give up a rig slot for any future in-game ship customization, but that won't be a decision coming from me or team trilambda. :)ccp darwin <U+FFFD> senior software engineer, art & graphics, eve online <U+FFFD> @mark_wilkins"
9/30/2014,"this feels like additional complexity, with no gain.(the racial changes for bc and dds evened out the ship progression)"
9/30/2014,"sure there is a gain, more skills and sp for me"
9/30/2014,-1. just no.
9/30/2014,"congratulations xenuria, best troll thread of 2014. managed to get 4 of the csm to respond even!setting the bar high for next year :)"
9/30/2014,this is not a troll thread.i have every intention of running and hopefully winning election. only by challenging myself do i become stronger.winning the csm will be very difficult but once i have the rest will be cake.the workload described by csm members past and present seems like a dream to me. i did an 800+~ page independent study on system analysis and design when i was 16. i think i can handle whatever ccp throws at me. frankly my plan to build rapport with the other members was to take on far more than my fair share of work and duties.this is less about proving myself to my peers and more about my own learning and growth through the helping of others. i have only ever truly triumphed in the service of others.
