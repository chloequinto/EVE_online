12/1/2013,"i think people need to think more about new players.how many months do players need to spend training in order to meaningfully participate in pvp beyond suicide tackle and blobbing t1 frigates?bombers are an insanely important middle ground that allow for really fun and interesting pvp from low skillpoint accounts, able to group up and damage larger ships.this is good. not bad."
12/1/2013,"while it certainly is always good to get newbros involved, not every instance of a low-sp ship having an effect is a good thing. if t3's were cheap and low-sp we could get newbros into those and have some fun and interesting pvp. taken to an extreme, why not get rid of sp and let them fly supercapitals?first, let's think about why we have sp. sp is actually a resource. every character, corporation, alliance, and coalition has a limited amount of sp and chooses to allocate that sp income every month towards flying certain ships (or doing whatever else people do). i can spend 61d 1h 42m 50s training for an arazu *or* i can spend 59d 17h 0m 52s training for a loki. there is a decision to be made there.a pilot can spend a few months training for a t3 and run lowsec missions. a corp can spend a few months training for a battleship doctrine and siege a pos. or you can spend one month, 1/5 - 1/10 the isk, and do both in a stealth bomber. and get initial tackle on every gank. and bomb battleships.my complaint about ' low-sp cost is that the utility/sp ratio is too high. my entire corp has trained for it because they're just too useful to skip. they seem ""insanely important"" because nullsec alliances/coalitions fill fleets of them for the same reason.if stay low-sp (no t2 torpedo/bomb changes), they should probably lose some of their utility. consider one of my 2 proposals at the bottom of the second post."
12/1/2013,"are in a healthy place (they were rebalanced ffs), lets try not to make them **** again.and all ships are op when you have a large fleet of them, that's why blobbing is so popular. this is regards to their bombing ability that malcanis has said he has brought up to ccp.and tech ii frigates should be easy to get into, training time in this game is already out of control across the board."
12/1/2013,"did you even read the op at all? if so how can you think that bombers are in a ""healthy place"" as you put it. why is a t2 frigate, (which is basically free, 50m is nothing) a better choice in so many situations over ships that should be more specialized for those roles.""there will be neither compassion nor mercy; nor peace, nor solace for those who bear witness to these signs and still do not believe."" - the scriptures, book of reclaiming 25:10"
12/1/2013,"first i would like to thank ccp for their work on the tournaments, streams, and allowing a practice environment on sisi server, despite the cost to the company. i believe and hope that they agree that it greatly adds value to the game and attracts new players through the streams of the matches and news coverage thereof.as so, i believe it would be even more beneficial to improve the already present eve tournament experience. why? that new e-sport income. 35 million people watched the lol finals, eve tournament finals were a slightly less profitable 12k. there currently is no sci-fi esport scene, there is a lack of more complex competitive games, and eve has both the graphics engine, and inherent complexity to sell this. 1) create a player runnable tournament match mode there have been player run tournaments and they've been of two kinds: purely player run singularity skirmishes, and ccp assisted (syndciatecl). they both require a singularity client download, and either a dev to be online to assist, or a player to run a module scanner in order to enforce fitting rules as best as possible. both of these are very inconvenient and do not lend themselves to modern competitive gameplay.this could be greatly simplified if eve allowed a mode for setting up a match that included teleportation into a at-like jove space, while enforcing implant, module, and rig rules. in a perfect world, the tool could monitor boundary violations, keep score in local chat, and end the match at a predesignated time. this would make it much easier to involve new players in the tournament system and build hype for the tournaments (something that has been decreasing last 2 years).this mode would also facilitate running of tournaments in a season like format, something very popular with the viewing audience at large. since it wouldn't require any dev presence, players could self-run the matches and stream the results for viewers at regular intervals, helping build a steady loyal audience. since the matches would use ccp tools, they would guarantee that the tournament rules were followed, while leaving the option for backstabs and spying that are so crucial to the eve experience.2) facilitate commentary and viewer understanding with a more descriptive overlay for above modeccp does a good job providing tools to add information to the tournament streams, but that is not available to player run instances. in addition, i think ccp could definitely do more with their own overview. for example, a ship overlay that uses icons to let a zoomed out camera tell at a glance what ships classes are being represented by the little blue and red squares would be very helpful in explaining what is happening on screen. instead of a scattering of dots, it would be immediately obvious as a frigate rush at a logi, or something of that sort. 3) allow recording and analysis of this overlayccp provided something similar as an ipad and flash tool for atxi. this was a fantastic step and it would be great to see more of it, with expanded options that easily provide the public information on ships: velocity, relative transversals, shield %, visible effects, etc.4) for your consideration: a more stream friendly tournament formatthis is a very heavy request and i would be very happy if it simply got a reading and some dev feedback. the eve tournament mode is a 10 minute ""team fight"" with very little plot to it. for your consideration, viewers prefer a more narrative format, one that is entirely in matching with the eve gameplay philosophy. forcing the players to start in rookie ships, and then letting them use eve mechanics like mining and looting to move ore and goods into a home base, sell those, and buy new ships and fittings, would add length and story to the matches. it would be also intuitive to the tens of millions of moba aware viewers looking for a more complex and sci-fi fix. upon death in this mode, the player should return to the home base as a rookie ship (after a set penalty time), with the option to use team isk to purchase a new ship before undocking. the matches would continue until one team loses their home base. if ""mining with lasers"" is to be pursued, the home bases could spawn pirate rats that move towards the enemy base. killing them would yield bounties. i don't believe that ""laning"" mechanic is necessary, but if one was desired, it could be set up through 3 warp-able to asteroid fields per team, each defended by a strong ""tower"" rat based on a mission sentry gun set to attack one team but not the other. again, thank you for your consideration, and please pass to ccp my thanks for all their support of the competitive eve scene over the years."
12/1/2013,"one quick additional point i would like to make: to the charge that ""low risk pvp"" is a violation of eve concepts, i would like to point out that ccp already provides a no-cost no-risk tournament system through the singularity server with the free mods, and ban on non-consentual pvp. as so, these changes would not change anything about the eve gameplay at all.thanks for reading."
12/2/2013,no it sucks that taxes went up in hs. that said what this change did allow is yet another stream of income to highsec warmongers. most of the smaller corps that erected a poco are on a ticking clock to make the isk back they spend on the customs office and will continue to bleed carebears dry till they get's war decked and the poco goes boomb. the folks that are running the cheaper pocos are just gathering intel to find out who they can war deck will buy their way out in a surrender garnering the corp even more isk. manufacturing skills are still profitable. less so with your material (oprotunity and isk) costs rising. that is not balance that is isk redistribution plain and simple. i see no way for a small corp to get anything but ripped off on this poco thing. train the skills to reduce the empire portion of the tax or make buddy buddy with someone in wh or null. with odyssey's removal of scanning skills necessary to find good ore deposits killed prospecting for me and rubicon's removal of scanning skills for exploration with ghost sites is even worse. it seems like they are more at odds with explorers than carebear industrialists. when was the last time you had an invention attempt blow up and take your ship and loot with it? put on your big girl pants. i am just a little hs pi alt and with customs code expertise don't know much else. my character sheet says so. at least dust toons aren't calling orbital strikes on your command centers.
12/2/2013,"[quote=malcanis]1) the csm has raised this topic with the five-0 devs on several occasions.and they have made things worse by making the apocalypse another drone ship, and adding new soe drone ships. gee look, let's use a drone ship! i don't want excuses and but but but from the csm. i want you demanding they fix the game. 2) it's possible that drone assist has this effect, but you don't know for sure. also see above.ccp will know. and guess what, the design concept of drones being equal to other weapons simply isn't holding water - they made drones superior to all others when they added modules and assist, guard, and kept ecm of the owner not stopping drones from delivering full damage. if you don't use drones you are simply stupid, currently. and guess what, the servers can't handle it in large battles. i know, been there, seen the slideshow, got the ""we crashed the server ... again"" t shirt. not good enough for a 10 year old game that should at least know how to host a fleet battle by now.3) pretty sure the server doesn't render any sounds whatsoever. that's purely a client-side operation.server has to tell the client to render sounds from other ships. i sat still at a gate in highsec and tested it - my audio was playing sounds from other ships passing with mwd on. that means a whole heap of range calculations and instructions to play sounds that are quite simply utterly pointless in a pvp battle where the server can't handle the basics, like not crashing.4) t2 ships are meant to be specialised. i don't know how this comes as a surprise to you. ""hyper specialistion""? what merely ordinary ""specialisations"" were lost with the removal of missile slots from the mael? this smacks of mere nostalgia for irrelevent fluff.missle launchers on pilgrim were not 'fluff'. they meant you could fit fire and foreget missles to kill a falcon. now falcon beats pilgrim, 100% of the time, if the pilgrim was fighing someone else when the falcon lands. tic, tac toe, game over. no unpredictability, less fun. making mono-use fits diminishes the game, which jar from the whole point of rigs being added in the first place to increase customization and variation. ccp need to decide - are they making ships mono templates (like the mael is now), with one possible use (e.g. zealot not having the power grid to fit sniper beams, so it is only a close range brawler, ever, no missile options) - or do they want to promote uncertainty in pvp by allowing large variation in fittings. they need to choose - sandbox, or wow. it's their call, but i see them going down a wow path, and i hate that. 5) pvp happens in 0.0. sorry you can't farm anoms with the same blithe safety as a mission farmer in a 0.7. maybe consider organising and leveraging your power as a group, the same way the ""afk"" cloakers are doing.pvp rarely happens in 0.0. most of 0.0 is flat out empty, nothing, nada, nix. afk camping isn't pvp. pvp is pvp, you know, ship a attacks ship b. when you stop people playing eve, guess what, they play something else. and they are - even the mittani seems to spend more time talking about star citizen now than eve online. think about it.6) instant warping is bad but instant locking is ok?no, nothing should be instant in a pvp game. it's meant to be a game, not an execution of fun. i am not ok with the game concept of ""always works, always wins"" - that is wow pvp in a nutshell. the correct combination of keys, or one macro, means rogue a will defeat class b, no matter what the second player does. that isn't fun, isn't engaging and ultimately isn't satisfying for anyone over the age of 8. why? you won because of bad design, not skill. so i am not ok with instant warping or instant locking. instant cloaking isn't ideal either for that matter.7) even with the new interceptors it takes 4-5 seconds to get to an anom. if you're playing on a 5000ms latency connection you're gonna have a bad time. stay aligned and stay alert. oh and do that group thing i mentioned above.yeah nice thought. you are lucky to find 8 people playing in any nullsec system outside of pvp. usually it is one player with 7 botted toons following a main, or entire bot fleets. remember that part about campers and the anti-play style stopping people playing? been there, seen that, living the consequences. we used to have 20 to 50 active players in system every day. add campers, add betrayal by pandemic because they thought we might have gotten a new nice moon in the moon changes (we didn't), add more campers in our new home, and guess what ... lucky to have 3 real players. and they don't undock because you know you will get hot dropped by 10+. is that a valid tactic? sure. what have all those players done? well ... world of warcraft, war thunder, and star citizen, as well as many other mini games. and the really interesting thing is players on *both* sides have quit - because it used to be fun to pvp us, but now we never undock to fight, they don't want to pay $15/moth to sit afk in space stopping people playing eve, and they have quit, too. so yes. enough already, nullsec needs to be made viable for players. interceptors are fun, but they need to have things to be wary of as well. like minefields. or maybe re balance sniper ships so they can actually well ... snipe ;p anyway, my view - currently this game is tracking down to permanent mediocrity, due to bad game design decisions and lack of courage on the part of ccp to face up to past design blunders. step up, fix it, or watch the player base get stripped away by the new games coming online next year.things i am still waiting for:1. walking in stations, you know, with some point to walking in a station other than to see your boots.2. some meaningful interaction with dust marines, economy. 3. the return of skill 4. >5% of players in null."
12/2/2013,"did you ever stop and think that the reason null is so empty id because large alliances want it that way?what would happen if 1000 new players all moved to an empty system and called it theirs?right, they would be wiped out form multiple sides.the large blocks want less people around because it is easier to control that way. check the jumps/active pilots on the map once a day and see where people are. take away that and local, i will move to null in a heartbeat, because i can hide! unless someone gets on grid with me, i am unknown and can operate more or less solo for s long as i want. do something to force the blocks to not only defend, but patrol their own backyard.oh and a note to the sound issue:the reason you hear other pilots ship sounds is not because the server is sending you the sounds.the server is telling you what ship is where and which way it is heading. your local client then renders the correct ship model in the right place and adds in sounds. now, this is a necessary evil as bumping and shooting at each other is the name of the game."
12/2/2013,"it really sounds like you are complaining that ccp is removing split weapon systems. really? split weapon systems are generally much less effective than double-bonused single weapon systems. it might hurt variety a little, but it makes ships more capable in general. the interceptor changes have very much enhanced the ability to catch ratters, which can escalate into pvp. if you ware upset about the lack of ""pvp"" in your area, then move. different regions have different activities, and you find less pvp when living in a region with nothing but blues for 30 systems every direction. there are ships that get into warp extremely quickly, and there are setups that can still catch them. however, that doesn't mean you lose all the time, or have no options. come through a gate with an insta-lock thrasher, so your inty can't just warp off.. then power away! generally speaking, there are choices you can make to not die. interceptors have plenty to be afraid of..... smart bombing bs's, instalock alpha ships, etc, etc. there are many nullsec players... i recommend using ingame & out-of-game tools (like dotlan) to find them. as for your 20-50 active members no longer there.... sounds like you either need to start recruiting again, or you should move on to a more-active group of players that fits your style."
12/2/2013,"besides what mal et. al. already pointed out2) there is no publically available statistics that could prove this statement right. there are other factors involved, including the fact that some of the node-crushing fights that have occurred recently occur spontaneously. resolutions to this are fleshed out but very, very difficult to implement. at least its not pre-tidi.3) really? really?! sound is client side.5) show me on the doll where the evil afk person touched you while afk or how you weren't able to just move a system over. or deal with an afk cloaker appropriately. waaaaaaaahhhhh a-bloo-bloo-bloo.6) you can combine and mix-match rigs based on whatever scenario you want. how is specializing your ship to effectively increase what you want so horrible? it's the same as training a skill from iv to v for the additional percentages of effectiveness. are we going to get rid of skills too?7) yeah, interceptors are op if you play on dial-up. if you can't react to an interceptor coming into a system, you're not paying attention to the game and deserve to lose a ship if you're not ready for non-consensual aggression. and finally, star citizens isn't even out yet. stop using it as a benchmark. none of its ""features"" are set in stone until the actual game nears a point of alpha or beta release."

12/2/2013,was the csm ever consulted about this change prior to implementation? if so would it be a breach of nda if you were to say whether or not you were on board with this change?
12/2/2013,"i would like to comment on the first point.a possible idea that could easily be expanded/built upon would be the idea of an arena-esque environment. something that players and/or a team could queue into for arranged consensual pvp. almost like a matchmaking system. i know one of my biggest issues with eve is flying around for 2 hours to only get one fight. not even a good fight, i am talking about those ganky fights where someone wasn't expecting it. as of now, i don't know time to fly around for hours on end just to find a good fight. i think having some sort of matchmaking system in place in which players could enter the queue for arranged fights would be a great advancement in the right direction.just an idea to be thrown around. a dev/ccp 's thought on this would be awesome :dalso i have to blatantly thank ccp/dev/supporters for their work with the tournaments. it is most definitely the best place to get good fights, and those are the only ones i enjoy!and of course i can't leave out my: <3 fozzietaco"

12/3/2013,i find that the changes to the rapid launchers do make then unusable in most cases now. i can see the limited clip but the 40 second reload is not only annoying but ( i know it a game) unrealistic when a standard launcher can reload 30+ missles in 10 seconds.

12/4/2013,"do you have a t2 bpo? then don't bother. you're wasting your time. you will never be able to compete with the chosen ones (more truth than sarcasm, btw) whom have been granted these legendary items through the liberal use of deck stacking by their friends in ccp. they've got the best moons. they've got pocos on all their pis. they will undercut and undersell you every time because their operating costs, in both time and isk (what is this ""invention"" you speak of?) for t2 junk are so close to zero as to make no difference.that being said, there is still plenty of isk to made in old fashioned t1 manufacturing. you just have to work with a mindset of quantity over quality. sure, a single tech2 item might make you a million isk, but you know what? so will ten thousand cheap missiles when left on a big sale order in a major trade hub, if you're willing to wait a couple of days. of course this means more mining and less pi, but so what? neither one was going to win any awards for being particularly fun or interesting anyway. one sucks just as much as the other, so you may as well go with what works.i know you feel cheated on all the sp that you spent, but there's no point in complaining about it. ccp would sooner cut off their own nutsacks than refund a single sp to a subscriber. and i can feel your pain, op: i was a dedicated drone boat captain for most of my career, up to and including the day that ccp decided that drones suck and then went about making that belief into reality. so you're not the only one who'd like to get their sp from some skill or another that ccp decided to make irrelevant at some point - in fact i think the vast majority of subscribers have at least one skill that they wish they could just unlearn. but again, this makes no difference. the good news is that you probably already have more skills than you'll need to go into t1 mass production."

12/5/2013,"i want to start by saying that as a strategy, a home system to provide intel or just demoralize an enemy was a novel and entertaining concept that provided a platform for psychological warfare that did indeed add to the experience in previous iterations of eve, but with the overabundance of cloaky campers now, nullsec is broken. systems has broken nullsec in these ways:1) with the network rules that are in place it is possible to simply leave an alt in a system, minimize the window and forget about it, literally until downtime while everyone in a developed system spins in station screaming and crying to the alliance about neutrals in system.2) the skills to get a cloaky alt are simple and quick to obtain making cloaky alts.. very cheap.3) and most importantly... there is no tactical counter for this action. there is no way a player can mitigate this action or relieve it once it is in place. our sovereignty is being violated and there is nothing our pilots can do about it whatsoever.4) with 0 risk to the assailant it is a cheap (both figuratively and literally) tactic that provides far too much benefit for cost.the impacts of this breakage are far more profound than i believe anyone intended.neuts in system shut down industry corps. they always have and always will. regardless of what corps *can* do, the barriers that exist typically result in people logging off or spinning in station. even though they *shouldn't* and there are tactical options to continue mining and operations, when it comes to reality these options do not provide a risk vs. reward ratio that allows for activity to continue.why bother conquering an enemy? just park cloaky alts in their home system and watch them log off, effectively owning the system until downtime, when if planned correctly they just log back in afterward to continue the festivities for sometimes days on end.back in the days before the sov changes and it was just ratting and mining there were fewer ""carebears"" in nullsec that were out there to enjoy the game and have fun. now that the system is in place that has created a more inviting environment and made nullsec fun. we have this situation where that fun is being taken away by a mechanic that is simply broken.i offer some of the following as possible alternatives:1) offer a cloaking jammer that has multiple levels providing protection from different levels of cloaks (for instance a level 1 cloaking jammer would uncloak a prototype cloak, while a level 5 would reveal a black ops ii cloak.2) offer a ""cloak interference probe"" that could be launched by covops (ironically) ships to detect cloaked ships. these probes could have a short lifespan but would disable (for a short time) the cloaking device of any ships within its area of effect.3) increase the capacitor use on cloaking devices such that it would be impossible to run them and remain cap-stable for long periods of time. while traveling this would not impact them, but would limit their ability to simply troll the enemy.remember that we are here to play the game, and if we're pinned down by trolls.. it is fun for only one person who is reducing or eliminating the fun for dozens. i realize that eve, like life, is not fair.. but as a game, i believe that more fairness is required to make the experience enjoyable for everyone.thank you for reading this.belloch"

12/7/2013,"no, it makes ships good at one thing, and capable of being fitted for one thing only. there was a time in eve where you could use your inventiveness to surprise your enemy. compare the old armageddon to the new one. now you have radically less choice, and let's be blunt, lazers are still so useless that nearly no-one uses geddons at all. they 'rebalanced' a ship with a lot of variability into being a bad version of a dominix, so in large pvp we don't see them at all.same as ecm, neut ships, snipers, and laser ships. they are all effectively gone from the game. if i wanted to put heavy blasters on my raven that was my choice. but now we have the 'wowification' in full swing - not only can you not choose to fit surprise fits, but everything is turning into a drone ship, or being simply dumped by players. since the introduction of the abaddon who uses an apocalypse any more? the powergrid and cpu of ships is being very carefully managed too, to wipe out things players liked to use because they 'don't fit the classes'. zealots for example got shredded, and are now being used in suicide fleets because it's more fun to suicide it than to bother trying to sell the now-useless hunk of rubbish. when i see a dominix fleet in null, i know how it will be fitted. when i see a rogue in wow i know how it will be equipped. because i know their fit, and they know mine, unless one of us is really bad, i already know how the fight will end.see the point?we are now in a wow pvp era, which is all about instant dps. whichever dev is most responsible, i want his head on a pike for dumbing down this game so badly. and i love the nestor design ... oh look another dominix clone! ... we already know no-one will bother to put lasers on it for pvp."
12/7/2013,"if you as the csm let that happen then i vote no confidence in you and the current ccp devsseriously, no. just no. if people are not playing in h enough now, then work out why and fix that. don't dumb the game down more.cynos in wormholes will ruin wh entirely. ability to hatch a station in one? sure, with med facility, sure. cynos? no. just no, never, forget that or you may as well just delete wh space entirely. let us be very clear. making eve easier will not stop star citizen demolishing the player base on launch day. eve will only survive if it remains skill-based strategy game that is both unforgiving of mistakes and it must allow people to make mistakesif i want to build a nyx in a wormhole and get it trapped there ... so be it. allowing cynos in wh means the game is diminished, because there will be no risk to invading capital fleets. goons (etc) will simply cyno in roqual with clones and a dread fleet, destroy and loot everything over a couple days, then move on to the next one with no risk of being trapped in the wh. stopping people from splitting weapon types because it is 'bad' is also an example of this diminishing of the game - is it a mistake to mix missiles and turrets? usually, but players should be allowed to make such mistakes. conceptually this is the same design element as in a rpg where putting on metal armour stops a mage casting magic. the wow 'babying' approach is to make it so mages cannot put on metal armour, at all. the sophisticated rpg approach is you can put on the armour, but you suffer the consequences. eve online is famous for consequences (such as forgetting to have enough fuel in your pos in a wh) - but it must also continue to allow players to make mistakes. if it does not, it will doom itself. oh while we are at this ... sniper ships like apocalypse need to be able to target and shoot out to 500 km, and should micro jump drive distance x50%/level. when speeds went up and up and up more, the 250 km hard limit on targeting failed to keep up. you can't change one aspect of a game like this and expect things designed 10 years ago to remain appropriate.so ccp ... stop trying to make this a first person pilot game, it is not and never will be. star citizen is, and is from the ground up. making combat 'twitch' in eve is just going to make the game look stupid - and admit it, that is the intent of the interceptor changes. i don't like instant, i like skill being required, but there is such a thing as too far. and recent changes have gone too far, without considering other systems such as hard cap on targeting range. don't break eve because you know someone else is making something worthy of being very afraid of, as that won't work.the way for eve to survive is to be eve online - distinctive, strategic, chess in space where you can discover you lost many moves ago. making it too twitchy or very gimmicky (orbital strikes anyone?) is just going to leave it a muddled mess that makes people want the ""real"" eve back.so csm ... do your job. stop cynos in whs, before they really do ruin that.or get out. all quit, en masse, with an open letter to the developers saying you are done with the dumbing down of eve and ccp's designers' increasingly desperate measures to counter the threat posed by a first person space game that seeks to have the depth of eve online. this game will be absolutely fine if it stays true to its core design philosophies. the only problem is that it hasn't done that over recent years, and is fast heading to being a theme park not a sandbox. that game model works too, only when a new ride opens in a shiny new theme park, the old park closes. to survive, add more sand, not shiny versions of the same old thing, and don't put cynos in wh to make null even more pointless."
12/7/2013,"so you are ok that we have learned how to crash the server to save capital?attacking me personally does not change the simple fact that this game is now facing credible opposition for the first time in 10 years, and the recent design decisions by the devs suggest that they are moving away from the original design of eve online in order to try to protect the playerbase.that makes sense, only the game is broken when we can crash the server to save capitals. there is not meant to be a ""get out of jail free"" card in eve online, yet ... there are. and adding cynos in wh will be yet another get out of jail free card added, if they do that. so yes, we will see the design choice crystal clear soon.if they add cynos in wh, then they are dumbing down the game (as you won't need to find a wh and path to get in new fuel, just jump it in). if they keep true to the design of wh being dangerous, unforgiving places, they won't allow cynos in there. we will see soon enough."
12/7/2013,"you are one of the null alliances actively trying to stop people playing this game. and your alliance leadership is actively promoting star citizen.answer these:1) eve valkyrie is intended to be a direct counter to the appeal of a first person fighter experience in a rich world, as is intended by star citizen, yes or no?2) given the dust514 fiasco, do you have any confidence in ccp having the ability to integrate eve valkyrie into eve online in a meaningful way? for my part, that's yes and no. when a titan can instant pop a carrier, there simply is no time window for eve valkyrie pilots to be able to be involved in any meaningful pvp events. that and they would just get smartbombed to death anyway. so valkyrie may be a lot of fun, but like dust it will not be relevant to eve online itself. oh and star citizen not being set in stone is actually the problem for ccp. star citizen's designers are listening, and adding things in still to increase the appeal of that game. they even have mining ships now. by the time they are done ... it may look an awful lot like eve, just without the 10 year old legacy code, and a design that admits you can't put everyone in one system at a time and expect things to still work, rather than pretending you can and crashing out on the best battles."
12/7/2013,"no, i'm not.so? what mittens does on his dumb news website doesn't mean i listen to it or care.no, its a game some people at ccp's newcastle office made as tech demo for the occulus rift in their 20% time. no, i don't see it as a 'direct counter.'considering i've been playing dust since the early beta, have enjoyed it, and still do...yes. richard garriott syndrome."
12/7/2013,yeah sure i broke the nda just to score points in a meaningless forum thread.still i hope you have gained some insight into how it feels to have sweeping changes demanded for your game style by someone who doesn't share it.
12/7/2013,"ive stopped using drones for a while now since they tried to stop afk site campers and supposedly drone aggro was fixed but i find anytime i deploy a drone it gets instantly locked before it even touch a frigate. word is from what i heard from other players is the aggro is broken again but some players dont have a problem with drone aggro while others are instantly losing them out the bay. i would also like to see some kind of module that would send out a signal that would cause pirates to fire on that person using said module to make a tank in fleet mission ops once more a viable position. in an attempt to make pve more pvp and to keep afk mission/plex campers away the drone ships themselves have suffered huge setbacks, not to include the heavy missile nerf because of the tengus range make my command ship suffer in missions aswell having 54km range."
12/7/2013,"you need to get aggro from the rats before deploying drones. set them on ""passive"" if you don't want the aggroing things without your specific intent. monitor them carefully, and look out on screen for incoming damage; drones are no longer ""zero-attention"" damage; you have to pay attention just as you do with turrets or missiles.there will not be a module to make the zero attention dps, so you need to learn to manage them.nb: rats really hate ew and rr activity now. try using a target painter."
12/7/2013,"oh i do pay attention, i take the whole room before their even deployed and i use a painter but they are still attacked no sooner than deployed, so i resorted to using a web on a cnr and not deploying drones at at all. in the time i deploy and scoop without them attack i lose at least 1 drone with in that time frame, death rate increase if i was to other wise tell them to attack something."

12/8/2013,"i must say it makes a refreshing change to see star citizen waved as the ""give me my own way regardless of opposing facts or aguments"" club. once upon a time it was nothing but ""not giving me my own way regardless of opposing facts or arguments is eve's nge"".it got dreadfully tedious reading the some old hackneyed cliche as to why ccp should give random non-entity #53,019 their own way regardless of opposing facts or arguments. oh god, how tedious it got. but now we have a new hackneyed cliche. refreshing."

12/8/2013,i really have no idea what you're doing wrong then; that's not what happens when i deploy vs rats.which kind of drones are you using?are they set to passive or aggressive?
12/8/2013,"i've had problems with a few elite frigates. i would gain aggro and target paint them before launching drones, but the frigates would start shooting the drones when the drones hadn't even aggrod the frigates yet. i was using small drones.i last had this months ago, since i don't do missions anymore. but i also don't remember an update in the meantime.i remember this happening in the assault level four, against guristas.e: in my opinion, if there is a problem, it's that certain rats might have an unexpectedly high aggression towards drones. maybe some rats were overlooked when the aggression was adjusted."
12/8/2013,"hello fellow eve online players! i spend the majority of my time trading / station trading. i am running into an annoyance and have a suggestion to help better the game.when i want to sell an item in my station inventory, i normally right click it and press ""sell this item"".then the next step, is a window pops up, and at the bottom right of this new window i press the magnifying glass, with the title ""click for detailed market info"".it is an annoying process because it's a 2 step button click process. believe me that this adds a lot of time added on unnecessarily. especially because i have to click ""sell this item"" and then move my mouse around to click the magnifying glass.here is my solution: give us the option, within settings, to enable a new feature. the new feature is that we will now have a new choice when right clicking our item in the inventory.the new option will simply be a ""sell this item"" and ""view market details"" combo. this will solve a whole lot of issues, such as cutting the time spent on this by over half, and having to do an annoying mouse drag and click to manually select the magnifying glass.here is my rough draft for the name of the new option in the pop up menu:""sell and view market details"" or ""sell and view details"" or ""sell and details"". those are just my guesses for the name.i really do care about improving the economic and market side of the game. i love eve online a lot, and only want to improve the game. i am eager to hear all of your responses, and hope you like the idea!griff"

12/9/2013,"now that we have had some time to reflect on the pi / poco changes in this latest update, i would like to suggest a few tweaks.1. set the npc tax rate to zero when a player corp sets up a poco. lets think this one through for a moment - why should interbus (the npc) get any tax at all once their customs office is destroyed? it makes no sense - it is akin to paying rent to a 0.0 corp for a system they no longer control. it also makes the hisec pocos much less profitable for the player corps that have invested the 100m or so necessary destroy an interbus customs office and set up their own. interbus deserves nothing, nada, zero from planets where they have no customs office.2. apply customs code expertise to poco tax rates. i was not a big fan of this skill in the first place, but if you are going to say that training this skill gives you such expert tax knowledge that you can avoid 50% of the customs duty at level 5, then go ahead and apply it to pocos as well. player corps can set their tax rates with the sure and certain knowledge that anyone who cares a whit about pi will be training this to level 5 anyway, and it makes the skill consistent.3. tax free planetary launches. throughout history, there have been those daring individuals who seek to maximize profits by evading customs duties - they are called smugglers. the planetary complex you build, full of your own people - should not be sending isk payments out every time you do a planetary launch. instead, keep the isk and take the risk - make the planetary launch tax free from npc and poco taxes, but make the pickup of such a container in orbit a suspect-flagging offense, and make the materials in the container appear as loot in a smugglers wreck when destroyed. this motivates both smuggling and tax code enforcement by corps with pocos --flame on."
12/9/2013,"1.) absolutely no. if i can setup my own poco in highsec, and remove all taxes for important & exporting to it, then there is very little incentive to setup a poco in lowsec or nullsec. highsec poco's are much harder to destroy (no caps, need a wardec, etc), and while highsec planets produce less, many, many poco activites aren't centered on direct production, but for manufacturing higher tier goods from lower tier goods. the tax helps balance using the little-risk highsec activities from the much higher risk lowsec/nullsec activities. if you need a rp reason, its to pay for concords protection of your poco. 2.) the skill is fine as it is. no change needed. 3.) what are you smoking? smugglers get paid for moving goods. you have to pay to move goods from your planet surface to some orbital pickup point, and if they call that a tax, so be it. your not landing on the planet in your iteron, and it is silly to not to expect to pay for transporting goods from the surface to its pickup point. furthermore, the pickup point is usually in a ""safe"" location, which means you don't have to worry about some cloaked combat person waiting for you (they have to probe you first)."

12/9/2013,"oh and that bomb flight time?you are kidding me, right?bombers can't bomb interceptors or frigates any more. they just warp off before the bomb lands, or better yet zip 50 km past while having instantly pointed you.and i do mean instant - server speed, with all that lovely power of programs. maybe it's just great reflexes and wonderful ping, but if it is, then it means eve needs to be free to play for everyone who isn't in the privileged countries. because all you do in eve online now is lag, and die, to instant everything great ping players. or you too cheat, and do everything at server speed. why? you lose if you don't. interceptors can fly faster than missiles now... great. so two dominix remote repping with curators and one interceptor instant tackle, add good ping and you never lose. wow much?so yes, ccp ... sort this mess out. fast is fun. instant is not. and cynos in wh ... that better be a joke. because if it is not, eve online will be."
12/9/2013,"ok, so agree in part. dont think we need more %type implants we have hardwiring ones for that, or we have mods or whatever, put it this way we have a ton of different things to effect those stats, tbh too many.however i agree get rid of learning implants overall and bring in the boosters and remove the remap. it would be great just to boost the training just for a small period of time, and when i want to for certain attributes. so ill +1 you for that."
12/9/2013,"a few points: there are a few ways you can look at this: these are the facts: skillpoints are the primary means for your character to progress. attribute implants alter this rate of progression. these implants are destroyed when you are podded. the ideal way the game works: the more your risk, the greater the potential reward. --- if you want to train more sp/hr, you plug in implants. losing your pod means you lose these implants. this is a very sound implementation for all implants. so, where is the true issue? frankly, there issue is us players that ""game the system"". we can plug in implants and partake in very risk adverse behavior, essentially negating all substantial risks to our implants and maximizing our ""player progression"". highsec players with full crystal & slave sets never fear losing their implants in standard operating situations. learning implants are the worst, as you can make full use of their benefits while being in the complete safety of a station, or even worse, while being logged off. the truth is, i have no sympathy for a pilot that won't pvp in their ""slave clone"" or learning clone or whatever. the whole point of those implants is that if you want the rewards they offer, then you accept the risks of losing them. at the end of the day, the complaints about ""learning implants"" or ""slave implants"" or any other blingy implant is the same: you can't swap implants the way they can swap from an archon to a punisher to suite their current play style. this is what honestly needs to change. simply make it so you can swap clones without the jump clone limitations. several people (especially in wh space) have asked for a pos module that stores clones and allows this, and this is honestly far more ideal than boosters. (note, i am not advocating for the removal of the jump clone timer. i think swapping clones should require that ""secondary clone"" to be in the same location as you). at the end of the day, this greatly reduces the opportunity costs of pirate implant sets, which is a downside, but not something unacceptable."
12/9/2013,"come to think of it, that's been my experience as well, running anomalies. generally, i find that larger drones tend to get murdered by little ships really quickly if i use them indiscriminately. my solution to this was to carry a few flights of light drones along, use them to kill off the frigates, and then use heavier drones only when the area is clear of little stuff (this also helps deal with the ewar problem, which can be really bad in some sites). doing it that way, i find that lights tend to survive fights where heavies get murdered, since the light drones can evade incoming fire while killing the ships that go after them.try it out and see if it helps!"

12/10/2013,"whats the point of a poco if everyone using the planet can do free launches.rocketships aren't free you know, transporting a bunch of cargo from the ground into orbit is pretty expensive.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
12/10/2013,"true, but there is no cost difference between lifting 500m3 of lead or 500m3 of gold into orbit. i am not saying that there should not be a fixed price paid for every launch, i am merely saying that the cost of the goods in the container should not figure into that equation as this is not a tax transaction. at 500m3 per launch and one launch per 5 minutes, nobody is going to get too rich doing this - but it does provide an outlet around the extreme taxation pocos if you want to use it. the counter is that they may bust you running around with the suspect flag in a hauler."
12/10/2013,"3.) what are you smoking? smugglers get paid for moving goods. you have to pay to move goods from your planet surface to some orbital pickup point, and if they call that a tax, so be it. your not landing on the planet in your iteron, and it is silly to not to expect to pay for transporting goods from the surface to its pickup point.hauling corps with freighters get paid for moving goods. smugglers get paid for moving goods past customs authorities without paying the duty. the 'danger mode' of hauling would be blockade running, running from gate to gate in your cloaky hauler from nullsec to jita hoping you can get your cargo in. if it were possible to land on your planet in an iteron in this game, load up your cargo and then try to pull a daring han solo escape past the ships camped out in orbit, i would be all for it. as it is, the only possibility for smuggling is the planetary launch system. as i noted above, there is no difference in cost for launching 500m3 of lead vs 500m3 of gold, so planetary launches should be fixed price - no tax affairs. all that means is that it only makes sense to smuggle valuable items - duh."
12/10/2013,"[if i can setup my own poco in highsec, and remove all taxes for important & exporting to it, then there is very little incentive to setup a poco in lowsec or nullsec. highsec poco's are much harder to destroy (no caps, need a wardec, etc), and while highsec planets produce less, many, many poco activites aren't centered on direct production, but for manufacturing higher tier goods from lower tier goods.]very little incentive to setup a poco in lowsec or nullsec? what are you smoking? the huge increase in material extraction rates alone justifies that cost - the motive is profit. just wacking the interbus customs office and setting up your own at a 0% tax rate can add enough to your profit to pay for itself. yes, many of the hisec planets are used only as processing centers - importing raw materials from nullsec/lowsec and exporting higher tier items. you are still collecting taxes from the transactions through your poco, and there is still no reason for interbus to get any of it. concord protection? really? they protect everything from noobships to control towers for free all over hisec, so i don't see much point in that argument. i can make a better argument that buying and burning starbase charters in a control tower should entitle one to faction navy protection. as for hisec pocos being hard to destroy - are you kidding? i was watching battleship gangs do them in 20 minutes. so what if you need a wardec in hisec? any reasonable gang can put a poco into reinforced in 30 minutes or less."
12/10/2013,"would you support adding a base tax (say 15%....maybe reducible to x%) to all highsec activities in order to help balance the risk? meaning all refining, manufacturing/invention/copying, sales, lp, bounty, etc.you know... to pay for concord."
12/10/2013,"yes! although, ccp has already attempted to balance some aspects of highsec via limited resources."
12/10/2013,"i've destroyed plenty of poco's, and own a few myself. to rf a poco in 20 minutes, you need to deal out 6.5k dps, which is ~6 oracles. given 6 poco's in a system, that's 2 hours of structure shooting for 6 pilots. in nullsec or lowsec, you can use a single supercap (or dread if you are brave), and rf a poco in half the time. you don't have to wardec (time & isk savings), and you use less player time. in highsec, there are more planets than is pragmatic to control. this means anyone can setup their own ""tax free"" poco, and have the ability to perfectly produce high tier pi goods from low tier pi goods. why would this be good for the game? the only benefit that low/null planets would have is much better extraction rates.... this is good, but it is only one part of the pi industry. truthfully, you are only suggesting this because it helps you personally, not because it is good for the game."
12/10/2013,"i agree with ali. when looking down the barrel of a huge training time it is nice to know there is something i can do to alter the time, even by a small percentage.risk averse folks want to be able to 'hotswap' so they can have the best of both worlds, get out and fly cheap (or snake) when the time comes but maximize training effects when they are docked. in other words, the best of both worldsi get that . . . but i think i lean towards the keeping of the implants and all the decisions/factors to consider that make this game complex. i don't want to simplify the game, i like the decision process and the balancing of risk and reward.taking implants away would just then bring the next lamb to slaughter. . . why do we have skill implants? not the path i want to go down. so, no. i side with keeping them and even adding more choices. more implants and better reasons to pod a person as well as blow up their ship.this from a hisec carebear . . .

12/11/2013,"well that is one reason, lets not forget the main point, the most used reason for cloaky camping in null is not to actually kill anything but to disrupt game play. it is that threat of force projection that keeps many system from being used due to cloaky camping. if you cloak in a system and stay there down time to down time. there should be a mechanic to hunt you down and kill you. this have been a great discussion please everyone keep it up and going, once this reaches 10 pages i plan to start pinging the csm so valid arguments for all sides of the issue are welcome."

(many would claim the reverse to be true, and they cannot be proven wrong either)you are missing the real issue, by assuming that disrupting game play goes against the spirit of the game.obviously, the players only looking at the effect on pve in null, with sympathy towards the players claiming they cannot operate, will see a problem.but, does ccp agree?this is eve. the legendary sandbox, where betrayal and meta-gaming are actually advertised features, not embarrassing secrets.the key is, and i know many players who will not hesitate to point out this fact, there are players who like the psychological warfare aspect specifically involved with threat projection.is he actually paying attention?does he have a cyno fitted on his ship?if he has a cyno, does he have enough players ready to go currently?if all three of these can be answered yes, then you have the reality of danger, which is something many praise as intended to exist in eve.if you are uncertain about any aspect, then you have potential danger, the uncertainty that costs more isk by reputation than actual ship losses themselves.if you know that any of these three is false, the threat is empty, and you can operate safely with minimum preparation against possibly a single ship.but: if you open the door, even for the price of effort, to resolving the presence of a cloaked ship... then you also remove the uncertainty, and with that goes the cloaky plus afk combination's effectiveness out the window.tl:dr : if you can balance the ability to hunt cloaked ships, afk cloaking will become manageable, if not entirely obsolete.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
12/11/2013,"i fully agree with most everything you have said, and if the a new mechanic was made that made it fully manageable i would agree with everything you stated. however i am not asking for it to be easy, in fact i want and active cloaky camper to be near impossible to catch without a lot of effort. this will make the risk go both ways. currently, it is not a risk to cloaky camp, and many do it while fapping to lady gaga or some other online activity. i fully belive in the sandbox, i just belive it should be a two way street."
12/11/2013,"shoretened quotes in the interests of brevitywe agree, in this case. perhaps in many other ways as well.i have worked the problem from reverse, and done some research into cloaking.for myself, cloaking is great for travel, assuming one has the correct skills and tactics combined with a properly fitted ship.i also explored the side relating to countering my own normal gameplay, by seeing how hard it was to catch miners or ratters.(in null, obviously)my results, in hindsight, were quite predictable.i could not catch anyone. (details oversimplified here, obviously)oh, sure, if someone had been traveling between systems at the wrong moment, or were not watching local or their intel channels, i might have had a better chance, but those opportunities are far from guaranteed, and can be rather uncommon.then i recalled how i had evaded similar threats while i mined. what tools and tactics i had used. what my vulnerabilities were.in summary, i realized that if i was simply alert, and planned on what to do in an emergency, i was safe to anything beyond a ridiculous threat such as a blob reinforcing pos or outpost.and i could simply jc out, or leave entirely with my corp, in that case.my ideas on how to approach this followed, using my insights and experience.the two threads linked in my signature, are intended to be used together or not at all.this third thread below, can be used even with local unchanged at all. it also does not allow hunting of cloaked ships, but does trade better awareness for effort."
12/11/2013,"[in highsec, there are more planets than is pragmatic to control. this means anyone can setup their own ""tax free"" poco, and have the ability to perfectly produce high tier pi goods from low tier pi goods. why would this be good for the game?] flip it around. why would this be bad for the game? you can set up a hisec factory planet with perfect production, but where exactly do you figure on getting the raw materials or trade goods needed as inputs for it? you won't support many perfect factory worlds doing extraction in hisec, so you are either extracting in lowsec/nullsec yourself or buying the inputs from people who do.[the only benefit that low/null planets would have is much better extraction rates.... this is good, but it is only one part of the pi industry.] yes, but it is one of the most important and profitable parts. oil companies own refineries and oil fields. the refinery doesn't make any gas (profits) without the input from the oil field. why do oil companies explore for oil fields in very inhospitable places? because that is where the oil is, and that is where they must go to make profits. similarly in eve, your perfect production planet is not making any profits without the inputs from other planets. the raw materials have to come from someplace so the ultimate benefit to moving out to lowsec/nullsec extraction is profit. [truthfully, you are only suggesting this because it helps you personally, not because it is good for the game.]truthfully, you are entitled to your opinion - that and $1.00 gets you a cup of coffee. pi is a profit motivated venture. why do it otherwise? you have already pointed out how a griefer gang of 6 oracles spending a couple of hours can wipe out $600m isk worth of hisec pocos and render your ""perfect production planets"" worthless by eliminating import/export without even bothering to put up new pocos themselves. my no-tax-for-npcs proposal changes the roi calculation on a hisec poco and make it easier to justify spending $100m putting one up because you aren't splitting income with interbus. my customs code expertise proposal just dovetails onto this by making the owner of the poco figure that everyone who cares will train to level 5 and pay half the published rate - so he sets his tax rates accordingly. people who do not train to level 5 pay more, and he makes a bit more profit on that. my tax-free / fixed-price launch proposal merely provides an alternative outlet for those with no customs office at a planet, or a poco with prohibitive tax rates."

12/13/2013,"my experience is that you get about 2x the extraction rate in lowsec and 4x the extraction rate in null/wh space (per head). i don't think this difference in extraction rates alone would offset the cost of moving goods from low/null to highsec. especially since nullsec generally requires the use of jf's to move goods, which adds considerable logistics cost. furthermore, some people would simply setup alts to milk highsec worlds dry using straight up extractor worlds, since moving those goods to/from a planet would cease to cost anything. in the end, this would simply be an unnecessary buff to highsec, which is the safest area of the game. highsec was already recently buffed by the creation of highsec pocos, and i don't see the need to buff it again (especially in a manner that discourages pi in other sec zones, by reducing the profitability of pi overall). have you ever tried to conquer someone elses poco's? 6 oracles can put an entire system into rf spending several hours of time, but then to complete the job, they must return at the owner's designated time and spend several more hours to finish the job. if they don't destroy it within 4 hours of it exiting rf, natural shield regen will increase shields to the point you have to endure another rf cycle. a griefer group then must alarm clock to conquer the damn thing, and the poco's are still fully operational when rf'd. this is on top of wardec fees, the ability to bring in allies, and the shear number of available planets, and i'm certain you are being unrealistic about highsec poco vulnerability. to be frank, the roi on highsec poco's is already reasonable if you are fully utilizing your planets true potential. why does the roi need to be improved? a longer roi makes it a larger risk to operate one, and more risk is exactly what highsec needs!"

[ i'm certain you are being unrealistic about highsec poco vulnerability]in think you are being unrealistic in expecting small or midsize hisec industrial corps to have the pvp capabilities to resist a dedicated pvp griefer gang. what does it do to your calculations if that griefer gang is 6 rattlesnakes instead of 6 oracles? are you really going to hire a merc corp for a $1b isk or so, or put $2b or $3b isk worth of your own ships on the line to save a $100m isk poco with a 3-month roi? [to be frank, the roi on highsec poco's is already reasonable if you are fully utilizing your planets true potential. why does the roi need to be improved? a longer roi makes it a larger risk to operate one, and more risk is exactly what highsec needs!]the risk calculation for hisec pi has gone from ""no risk"" to ""you would have to be smoking crack to think this is a good idea"". there is no possible way you can compete extraction-wise with the big alliances / corps based in lowsec / nullsec. if you do manage to get a hisec factory world organized, and somehow manage to feed it enough materials to keep it running, any large corp or griefer gang can come by and eliminate you with a wardec and just smash your poco at any time. to be frank, even the changes i am suggesting might not be enough to change the risk/profit calculation to make hisec pi a good idea again. the only ""hisec buff"" that the poco change made was to buff the ability of the large corps to squash the little guys. i'm trying to level the playing field a bit with my suggested changes."

12/16/2013,"lore-wisesomeone has to get that material launched from teh planet.you know, the planet now owned by immortal demigods wielding apocalypse-level weaponry with literally negative fucks given about human life?so, yeah, you are going to be paying npc residents a shitton of isk to get those goods into space for you, and if they see those goods are valuable, then of course they are gonna charge you more for their risk."
12/16/2013,"so, you transport 450m isk in goods to highsec... you require operating a 6b isk jf, needing 20m in fuel, and certainly encouring inconviences and/or risks when moving it. alternatively, you can earn 1/4th this (110m isk) over the same time frame, you don't need a 6b isk jf, and you don't operate in risky space. paying the 5% tax on your exports reduces this to 105m isk, which has marginal effect on your profit line for these goods. in contrast, your factory worlds which routinely purchase 500m isk in materials to import down to a planet and then export it as 1b in higher-tier commodities are going to be much more heavily impacted by the import/export taxes. it is precisely because of this you wish to eliminate the npc taxes, so you can have your perfect factory worlds. why do you deserve tax-free factory worlds in highsec? you are already enjoying low-risk operating costs, as well as concord protection, i don't understand why you should be on equal rewards with null/lowsec. hmm... let's look at the small or midsized hisec industrial corps. what do they have in common? they own and operate pos's, most notably with adv & regular mobile labs. these run 60-110m each, not to mention the 3-12m / day operating expense. these corps regularly deal with ""griefers"" (you keep using that word, i do not think it means what you think it means) that attack them, usually for the profit involved in blowing up the pos and taking the labs. they put just as much up front (if not more), they have about the same roi, and they cope with the threats that come at them (or die, hohoho). while poco defense is different than pos defense, each has their own major benefits over the other. again, i am positive you are being unrealistic about highsec poco vulnerability. 1.) oracles are used because they do decent damage (800-1,000 dps) without the need to reload ammo. 2.) rattlers are tanky, but do less dps than an oracle unless fit with missiles. if you are going straight dps, there are many ships that will out-perform rattlers (like the talos). if you want dps & pvp ability, there are also many ships that outperfrom rattlers (although they have their niche too). 3.) you don't need to put 2-3b isk on the line to take on a 6-man gang. you need to play smarter, not bigger. 1.) this is, and has always been risk when operating in highsec. it is still generally low risk though. 2.) ""no way you can compete extraction wise?"" my dear friend, poco resources are worse than asteroid resources. you keep mining the planet and you keep getting resources. the difference between highsec and lowsec/nullsec is you gain more resources when operating in riskier environments. we call this concept ""risk vs reward"", and i fully support upholding this paradigm. 3.) qq -- some boogy man might attack your poco for zero profit, just to **** you off. when this happens, offer to sell it to him to recoup your costs. it save them hours of shooting structures, and is generally win-win (i've dealt with buying & selling poco's many times). then you move your operation somewhere else. this is a dog-eats-dog world, and you submit/lose until you are strong enough to win. 4.) why would the big badass boogyman no-one else can defeat be interested in your lame-ass pocos? hint, there is very little profit in blowing up a poco, and shooting them for ***** and giggles gets very old very fast. pragmatically, the only time your poco's get attacked is if you attract attention to them somehow! then you rightfully need to deal with the fallout."

12/19/2013,same way you kill miners/ratters while afk..........majick!
12/19/2013,"yeah, makes sense to me. always for additions to the game that take very little coding and art department time."
12/19/2013,"my proposal is simple:1. allow discussion of bans and/or gm actions on a specific subforum within the official eve forums. as long as other forum rules on no personal attacks are upheld, i don't see a reason why this couldn't be done. furthermore, limiting it to a specific subforum would make moderation easy in the other areas, alongside explaining that there will be no official action or response based on a forum thread.2. create a transparent process for escalating petitions of gm actions. the biggest benefit of this would be to encourage uniformity within gm decisions and end some of the arbitrary decision making processes that have prevailed in the past.part of the csm's job is to create transparency and give players a voice within ccp. and it does that very well on broad issues. but on individual issues, it has been my impression that gm decisions tend to made arbitrarily and without requirement for backing up, etc. this is further stifled by not allowing discussion of said incidents on the forums, something which seems extremely draconian and ultimately unnecessary if there is uniformity within these actions.i'd appreciate any comments or criticisms of this proposal."
12/19/2013,"the primary issue is the additional cost for ccp.banned players lie. they lie a lot. they will go to this subforum with their fake tale and try to stir up controversy. they will manufacture chat logs and do everything they can to convince people that ccp is the bad guy. for every case of someone who was banned improperly, there are a hundred exploiters explaining how they were banned improperly. this forces gms to spend time refuting a constant stream of lies and this costs money."
12/19/2013,"that could be mitigated a lot if ccp introduced some way for players verify what was said. say by giving the person the gm is communicating with a link that lets anyone see the full discussion between the player and gm. then take action against anyone who starts a thread without providing their link. or adjust the forum software to make that automatic.if someone fabricates a chat log, then bring in moderation. first have the moderator paste the genuine chat logs, then bring down serious public punishment. other posters will quickly get the message that dishonesty is not tolerated there."
12/19/2013,"the thing is, game companies are very secretive about how they find exploiters, so that exploiters have a harder time avoiding punishment. players often aren't given the specific evidence that incriminated them. so you would get these logs that say something like ""dear x, you have been banned for exploiting y"" and the player will say something like ""i wasn't exploiting y. it was an accident! i was running program z and that must have confused the moderators."". so your proposal will still require that gms put in more work to create a report detailing evidence against players and it will help exploiters avoid future protection.and i promise you, this particular forum would require a ton of moderation. even with strict punishments. likely as much as the rest of the forums combined. you would have angry posters trying to vindicate themselves. trolls stirring up these posters and people who love drama picking sides and flaming. it would be crime & punishment on steroids."
12/19/2013,"in order to launch missiles that rapidly, the launch tubes must be pressurized. this takes thirty seconds. the other ten seconds is for reloading all of the missiles. boom realism."
12/19/2013,"my opinion: deal with it. rlmls were overpowered and had become a ""you are an idiot if you don't fit these"" for fights. now they've been nerfed, but simultaneously morphed into a new type of weapon that has some serious advantages with one major drawback. eve should be about choices like this."
12/19/2013,"this has nothing to do with homeland security, this is your bank's anti-fraud department. since you do all your transactions in one place or to popular online sites, when you make a payment to an obscure company in iceland they assume the worst.i'd ask to talk to their fraud prevention people and have them make an exception for this transaction for you. when i travel abroad, i always call my bank first to let them know so they can put a note in their systems so my card doesn't get rejected."

12/21/2013,"silvery delight,i agree, the old 'tutorial' agents definitely helped a lot to repair or boost faction standings. option 2 of this proposal would make those agents a lot more viable for both new and old players.thank you for giving support to this proposal.dmc"

12/21/2013,this is a non issue. it is just another game mechanic people use and some abuse regularly. as for ccp response i can some it up in one of the oldest lines of eve... don't fly what you can't afford to lose.but if i was going to make a suggestion to fix it then just make a tech2 version of the mobile cyno jammer that would jam or decloak cloak a ship entering it's field.

12/21/2013,"i think most people have no issue with a pilots ability to stay cloaked, afk or not and harass enemies in a system. however add a new aspect to the game. give us the ability to hunt cloaked ships just like the allies found new ways to hunt menacing submarines during world war one then again in world war two. it just makes sense that technology would be developed to hunt cloaky ships.it would add a new challenging aspect of game play too, trying to hunt down stealth boats and stealth boats no longer running around cloaked with complete impunity.brought to you by -barony of vulnezia mmo micro nation- www.vulnezia.com be a part of the world's first mmo micro nation"
12/21/2013,finally someone who not only understands what i have been getting at but has found a better way to put it. this is exactly what i have in mind.
12/21/2013,"i have long endorsed this as a solution.but, it is not complete, by itself.the reason is, in my own and several others opinion, that cloaking becomes trivialized if you are made aware of it automatically, and can then choose to hunt it based on this awareness.the world war two analogy, did not have the radio shack operator warning their respective ships that a sub was in their region, and ships should return to port for safety concerns.the sub had to either screw up, and let itself be spotted, or be known as a consequence to otherwise unexplained ship loss...battle group commander: this freighter was lost contact at these coordinates. with no enemy surface assets close by, it must be something we could not have seen, and we all know what that means...destroyer captain: i follow your point, sir. i'll have my boat and the others begin a sweep with sonar. we'll catch that devil!it was also a point that proactive searching was also common, around important ships particularly.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
12/21/2013,"i totally agree,this is why i have not opposed cloaked ships dropping from local.it may be another discussion and in other threads as well, but if local were not the intel tool it was, another method such as programbles scans that can be automated or somthing along those line should be implemented,this also requires paying attention to the scans.as far as cloaked ships goes, there should be some tell tail that they are there but not a glaring one unless you are actively searching. then you should have some reasonable chance of finding the cloaked devil. however if he is smart and alert that could be impossible and should be however if he is careless, and inactive hunting him down should not be all that difficult.for instance, in wormhole space it is prudent to d scan every 5 to 10 seconds or so, and in null, before i do anything i probe my systems and the systems around me to wormholes so that i can have a reasonable chance of not being surprised by someone."
12/21/2013,"keeping in mind, that wh players have been perfectly clear that they want no means to detect cloaked ships.(a few often show up in various threads, to warn off ideas they see as threatening their play style)ccp has implied they would like to see cloaking made into a cat and mouse exchange, with ships chasing after each other.i think that would add a lot of interest to the game, especially in null.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
12/21/2013,observed the new rhml launcher addition to cal navy lp store. it costs the same number of tags to produce 5 of these as it costs to produce a bpc for 5 run 200mm railgunthat's a battleship weapon for as cheap as 200mm railguns (cruiser weapon). how does this make sense at all?
12/21/2013,if this is such a problem just go buy a refillable credit card and just put eve and the price to keep the card active on it. hell it is how i do most of my online anyway.

12/21/2013,
12/22/2013,"imho, faction weapons should outperform t2, but only until specialization 3 or 4 for the t2 weapon, as fara s weapons go, the only kind of modules that should ever perform better or equal to t2 at lvl 5 spec is ded or officer gear, faction should be allowed t2 ammo but become weaker compared to t2 after spec 3 or 4. hell, kinda on the fence on whether faction should perform so much better as it does than t2 for the other module types as well, makes t2 kinda silly in a lot of cases, where the ""benefit"" of that faction is a better module for triple or quadruple the cost, but extra fitting room to make an overall vastly superior fit than if you had used t2, making it a huge benefit. but whatever, ccp will do whatever the hell they please."

12/23/2013,"cost should never be used as a balancing factor. what you pay for an item on the market is your decision alone. the point of contention here comes from the manufacturing cost from the lp store - taken against the raw stats performance of the item and finally the supply of materials from the source.as i detailed above - the supply of tags for these items used to be part of fw plexing, in addition to mission farming. now though the issue is much harder since those fw tags have been removed and all that remains are fw missions and regular missions. the average player will not farm tags from fw missions surely because of the immense danger that being in low sec and running a mission alone represents but also because of the loss of potential lp gain and the delay in the rewards from that mission alone. running missions like that in small fleets cuts in to everyones profits - it's a really badly designed system. high sec mission running will produce tags 'eventually' thanks to getting oodles of useless pirate tags first. i guess you could go to a border system from one high-sec to another and start farming the npc police that come to kill you but that seems slow and inefficient. at least non-fw gankers will get concorded i guess.thirdly and lastly are the raw performance for faction weapons over t1/t2/officer weapons. not much to say here, grab the compare tool next time you're in game and take a look. it depends on what faction you're taking the weapon from and what kind of weapon you want. faction weapons should definitely not have access to t2 ammo - the only reason to train t2 specialization is because of the t2 ammo. faction weapons in my opinion are really our meta5 weapons while t2 are our meta 6 items. it would more accurately represent the kind of dedication to their training that when fully decked to level 5 specialization a t2 blaster outperforms a faction blaster. once again though i leave those technical details to the balancing staff, my concern here is making the supply of faction weapons easier - such that they aren't 30 or 40 million for a small neutron fed navy because they don't *have* to be that costly as compensation for the effort of making them. even pirate faction weapons which share identical stats are often significantly cheaper only because they're so much easier to acquire."

12/24/2013,i kinda like this idea+1we need more stuff like that instead off the bullshit ccp throws out recently.
12/24/2013,how about you actually do something about the most posted mechanic in the game rather posting trash?
12/24/2013,"i would actually like that ccp carry the same attitude they have with faction ships (they want to see more of them in space). i support making faction weapons (and at least all navy faction modules) more accessible (much more volume and cheaper (2-3 times the price of the t2 module, not 100x in some cases). perhaps remove a large portion (if not all) of the tag costs? it could follow similarly to the difference between fw and highsec npc corp lp store prices as it is with the ships. i don't even think you would need to rebalance the faction weapons that much. there should a choice between using faction and tech ii. you lose the ability to use tech 2 ammo (which is a big deal) but you don't really gain that much from a faction weapon to justify the cost as it is now, slightly higher rates of fire (which are almost the same as t2 because of specialization skills), lower fitting, more ammo capacity, etc."
12/24/2013,"uhh, why? droneboats are already pretty strong, why do they need buffing? and they have a weapon system that doesn't use slots, which is (i think) the reason they have one less..."
12/24/2013,"so you are saying the gila should have one less slot and any ships that use drones should also have a extra slot removed?ships with a bonus to hybrids for example the thorax can use drones and a ship with a bonus to drones for example the vexor can use hybrids. yet somehow the vexor is penalised for using drones as a weapon system slotwise. what makes drones so special that a ship has to have a slot removed? hybrids have ammo yet for drone boats, their ammo [drones] can be destroyed. missiles can be blown up but do you see missile boats with a slot removed?ecm drones are pretty powerful yet ships with the bandwidth to fit them have the same amount to control as drone ships which is 5. do droneboats [excepting the guardian-vexor] have the ability to control more than non-droneboats who can operate 5 drones at the same time?"
12/24/2013,"well the only issue i have with the module now is that you can't selectively change ammo to exploit resistances (the primary advantage of missiles). although, eve is a game where most of the fight is determined before the fight happens, so you'd have to choose your ammo wisely (and set auto reload off to select your damage type every time you reload) so i can get behind keeping the long reload time (and honestly, if you're rocking rlml or rhml you've got a prettttty good idea that you're going against cruisers/frigates *cough* select your damage type then *cough*), but i really think the rlml and rhml needs the capacity for two or three more volleys and i'd be satisfied. the way they are now it does make it so you have to make a choice and adds a bit of spice for a high dps skirmish option. ccp just needs to make slight tweaks to find the g-spot in balancing"
12/25/2013,"well, if we can actually garner support, and stop getting the constant shitposting of ""abloo-bloo-bloo nerf cloaking abloo-bloo-bloo"" maybe ccp would pay more attention to the forums. especially if players put forth their ideas in a constructive manner which would reduce the number of questions that could be asked because it was presented in a well-thought out manner. the idea is to show that you did some form of research, and are willing to put forth some form of effort to actually constructively design something useful rather than something that will unbalance or completely break an already functional mechanic.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
12/25/2013,"in the interests of full disclosure, i must point out that so-called ""afk cloaking"" has a definitive meta gaming aspect that has not been mentioned here thus far.so-called ""afk cloaking"" is also a tool used by the pve players who meta game.they set up a fake threat, under a different account and unfamiliar name, help it sneak into the system, and set it up to afk cloak.using this fake threat like a scarecrow, they keep other alliance mates out of their systems... heck, they can even keep their own corp out, if they are nasty enough.using this threat to hold their ""competition"" away, they can rat and mine to their heart's content.they can even stage mock battles showing how they narrowly escape the dangerous camper, to boost it's realism.nope, afk cloaking can be done by pve too.welcome to the sandbox.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
12/25/2013,"why should i be the one to raise the level of this terrible whinethread?in essence, the complaint is that organised, invested groups of players are able to kill a semi-afk oblivious ratter. wherefore then, should i have the motivation to change any mechanic?the ratter can join an active, invested, pruposeful group and rat with impunity with existing game mechanics."
12/25/2013,"for sure, but till ccp rework completly this tool they still can upgrade current dscan and it will not require lot of ressources...a good idea could be :remove current dscan, set new dscan as a high slot module that can be activate when cloaked. a real tool specialised for hunting."
12/25/2013,"from odyssey there were changes to null industry:updates to the outposts in particular amarr factory outpost, increased manufacturing slots - ores arkonor through to spodumain received a significant boost to low end mineral returns from refining. following the release of rubicon the players were treated to a statistics about: ship losses in ghost sites training for particular skills to achieve masteries stats for mobile deployables this provides us with a gauge that rubicon is a successful release to the player base. so where are the statistics for odyssey? i would say that the mineral rebalance and outpost upgrades are a failure. there is little interest in mining outside of high-sec because ratting is safer, easier and more lucrative in null/low/wh.removing the volume of cheap high sec minerals provides outcomes of: null to develop/foster industry increased value to minerals obtained outside of high-sec immigration from high-sec (particularly by industrialists) increased cost of high-sec ships increases the risk mining frigates will remain available for those unwilling (or unable) to leave the comfort zone of high sec. (they also service well for tutorial and learning experience for the budding industrialist) introduce a ice turret for ore frigate will enable ice mining to continue.i believe that this is a necessary change to encourage greater engagement of the player base outside high-sec. i look forward to your support."
12/25/2013,this isn't a terrible idea either. what i would also recommend would be the following:- booster that enhances scan deviation and scanner probe scan time- booster that enhances mining/gas yield (for our combat indy pilots who run ventures into the unknown)just a thoughti am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
12/25/2013,"droneboats have always had one less slot compared to their class counterparts. the devs have mentioned once or twice that the sheer versatility of drone boats requires them to lose one slot.and as an avid drone user, i don't disagree with this. drone-centric ships are very powerful and versitile when used in close-quarters brawls (because unlike a ""normal ship"" you don't have to fit it around the weapon system).as for the gila... if it does indeed have the same amount of slots as its counterparts (can't be bothered to check) then it will indeed lose a slot when the rebalance efforts hit it."

12/26/2013,"i cannot say i agree. for one thing the versatility part, is it the drones that make them versatile, in which case what about other ships that can use drones? saying drones centric ships don't fit around their weapon system is false. people that use drone modules like drone damage amplifiers, omnidirectional tracking links etc, means that people are fitting around their weapon system., which are drones. putting a nos instead of a gun is also fitting around the drone weapon system. vexors are not the only ship that can fit a nos, thoraxes can too for example. thoraxes can use drones and hybrids too. do people reckon that the gila is overpowered compared to a vigilant and/or any of the other faction cruisers? is a navy vexor equal to a gila and/or vigilant? it would be good to know, because then we can see if a gila with the same number of slots as a vigilant really needs to lose a slot."

12/28/2013,let's keep it going guys! show that you want this!i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
12/28/2013,"hisec mining sucks, the only reason people do it is because they've never done anything else that's made them more isk and don't realize they are at the bottom of the food chain. it's already bad enough you can't have caps in hisec (although i understand the pros and cons and why they were removed in the first place), further limiting ship types by security rating is a crap way of doing things. it's a last resort method and shouldn't be used except in extreme cases and even then it should be used as sparingly as possible. it's bad sandbox design imho.there are many things that could be done first to help solve the issue (that honestly doesn't even need solving but i digress)."
12/28/2013,need moar drugs....i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
12/28/2013,"regarding the gila they don't need the damage and/or hp bonus for drones when they have their own damage bonuses for their weapon systems and any hp bonuses they also have. drone ships may be versatile in the type of drones they can carry but ships that use ammo can be versatile in the type of ammo they carry and there is also the fact that ships can at most control 5 drones at the same time. if a drone ship and a non-drone ship can use ecm drones which one has the advantage in regards to having the greater ability of using drones. stasis drones etc. drones can be webbed, can't do that to barrage. non-sentry drones are pretty easy to outrun and drones also face the dangers of bombs and smartbombs [i do know missiles get blown up by smartbombs but its not really something that missile users concern themselves much with].now i not too certain about thorax [i don't use them] remote rep abilities but i do know deimos's have used it with good effect"
12/28/2013,"they said that about the amarrian battleships too... then they were all tweaked and modified a bit.but that means that the ship is not drone-centric and that drones are merely a supplementary force... the same way turrets/missiles are act on droneboats. not exactly true. you can swap ammos all you want on a turret ship... but that adaptiveness is very limited. barrage, null, and scorch increase range, but cut tracking and offer limited damage. hail, void, and conflag increase damage, but cut range and tracking. all the other ammo types either increase range at the cost of damage or cut range for more damage.and none of them will affect a turret's sensor resolution.basically... it would be like being stuck using only one class of drone (light, medium, or heavy) all the time against all opponents.a drone ship doesn't have this issue. if you are fighting battleships, use heavy drones. if you are fighting cruisers, medium drones will apply their damage better. if you are fighting frigates, light drones will keep up with and track them. facing a foe you cannot win against? throw out ecm drones and align out.you can't do all of the above with a dedicated turret/missile ship. you have to make tradeoffs in the fit itself.as for the other stuff you mentioned...- webbing drones are terribad. i experimented with them for a long time and found out that each web they apply to a target is stacking penalized with all the other webbing drones. even with the heavy version (which has a 20% web), five of them won't exceed more than a ~35% reduction in a target ship's speed. so no one, be it a gun/missileship or droneboat will ever use these things.the same applies for all other combat utility and ewar drones (except ecm drones).- how often do you see someone seriously use a smartbomb outside of pipbombing/disco tactics and capital warfare? i can only remember two instances in the last 2 months... and they were nublets.- deimos' can't use rr tactics without giving up some of their guns (they don't have a utility high-slot anymore). they do have a nasty self-repair bonus though... but if you fit the ship around that then you have to downgrade the guns. an ishtar doesn't have to choose between dealing damage or tanking... it can do both... it can even do remote repairs as well!!"

12/29/2013,"after building up my first character, i started making industry characters to help corp and alliances i had been in. making some isk in the process as well and i imagine would have made even more if i had been in a null group at the same time with jf to come in and out.i do think the industry needs to be tweaked a little. i haven't done any mining or industry since they changed the mining barges so i maybe a little outdatedget rid of t2 bpo's or make t2 bpo's available for everyone. i really do not understand why this has not been done and why a lot of other aren't off the rails about them being around. i like the invention of t2 bpo's and the odds or success or fail on them. but some people / groups having t2 bpo's sitting around and others not able to get them is wrong for a sandbox game where competition in the markets is everything. so fix the mistakes made so long ago and give people equal footing. if you force them out then you have to give them something to make up for the time invested and such, but that is on ccp to figure out (or smarter people than myself ) what compensation should be.data cores - i would like to see these go back to being free, but if you don't do the daily mission, you hit a snag and don't gain any of the points for a new data core. i would make these missions a little harder, a little longer, and spawn in a random way (as in, you get them sometime in the next week, not one a day so you don't have to mission for them every day, but every day you wait after you get assigned a mission the less points you get towards data cores )pi - while i didn't agree with ccp having high sec poco's be taken by player corporations (as really it only hurts new players who where looking to try pi before moving it to low or null, guess there is still sisi for testing stuff ) i still like pi a little. i do wish there was more powergrid and cpu for the stuff, and i liked the older system when it fist came out to what we have now, but pi you can make money, and doesn't take too long to train so new people can get into it and make money by themselves or with others. if you cannot do anything with one toon, make another on the same account train the (i think a month or so ) on that toon for perfect skills and grab yourself more planets making higher tier stuff. i would like to see a tutorial for new players on pi, perhaps even giving on of the skill books for it. (or just link someones youtube tutorial about it in the industry agents missions )so, for the tl:dr, get rid / make available t2 bpo's for everyone, data core change again, perhaps other/advanced skills for more pg/cpu on pi and a tutorial for pi for new pilots.i have found that i actually usually like industry more than i like shooting others. both are fun though and what makes this game worth it to me. if you are smart, you won't be scammed ( in fact, just don't look at local or contracts and you will be fine most of the time ) and have made plenty of isk selling my items, even when giving some to other corp mates and corp for war stocks."

12/30/2013,"they grind sov like that not because it's oh so effective, but because they are worried about pl dropping supers on anything bigger. grinding sov in bombers isn't fun. also bomb runs aren't that easy."
12/30/2013,"no, if a gm makes a decision it wasnt done in some haphazard way, you did it, you knew you shouldn't have and whether gm x makes you pay more than gm y is irrelevant, stop breaking the rules and then you wont have to worry about gm actions.yawn, i'm right as usual. the predictability kinda gets boring really."

12/31/2013,"also siege fleets work well because massive immobile structures mean you can overlook pretty much all of the torpedos drawbacks as a weapon system, so it simply becomes a game of what way is the cheapest to bring the most guns."
12/31/2013,"sb are balanced.the training time and costs is in the same range of any other t2 frigate. and other t2 firgates are far more versatile.single sb can be used in a very limited situations. basically:in pve: only for 2 scenarios:1. blitzing lev 4 fw missions (so, a very specific subset of missions, not any low-sec level 4 mission as suggested by the op). and this is only because those missions are designed to be blitzed in this way. and have other drawbacks. and to do it properly need good skilled sb and torpedo, not just only the basic training).2. ratting in hostile 0.0 (sb can be a good option, not the best option, but viable)in pvp:basically any other ship equipped with a weapon system can eat a sb. any ship able to deploy a flight of light drones can get rid of a sb. a sb can only harm bs and bc (and all these have drones).beside few niches and occasional scenarios other use of sb in pvp involves a specializzed fleet, so their efficiency come from massive numbers or multiplayers organizzation. stating that sb are op becuase 10 sb can beat a bs is silly, becuase is a 10 vs 1 scenario, i don't see why a single player shoud have (by game mechanics) the upper hand over 10."
12/31/2013,"exactly. a proper bomber pilot will never fly without a group and should never fly without recon support. the bomber requires those things in order to be effective or else they're just a glass cannon that can only really harm haulers and mining ships. the people who kill ratting battleships only manage to do so because the rats have done most of the work to begin with. the concept of ""solo bomber pilot"" is utter rubbish."
12/31/2013,"here are the main issues with your post: first off, t2 bpo's were handed out ""fairly"" by lottery. those few that weren't (t20 incident) were addressed, and resulted in ccp creating an internal affairs group to prevent recurrances of similar game abuses. next, for most t2 items in game, invention is profitable. for those that aren't, the reason invention isn't profitable is because the demand for those items is too low. removing t2 bpo's will simply increase the price of these low-demand items for the end user. do you want to pay more for an eagle just so mr-idiot-manufacturer can potentially invent the item for a profit? furthermore, most t2 bpo's today are in the hands of investors that didn't acquire their bpo by luck of lotto, but by hard work grinding, stealing, or whatever. the bottom line, there is no good reason to remove t2 bpo's, and i challenge you to come up with one. there is one area of bpo's that should be addressed (note, i'm talking about all bpos). their useage needs to involve more risk. example idea: to manufacture from a bpo, that bpo needs to be in a pos lab (the major downside of this, it would inhibit new players entering the manufacturing field.) datacores are available using faction warfare lp. i'd love to see stats on the ""precentage of datacores produced from rp agents"" vs ""fw lp stores"". i could be wrong, but i'm pretty sure rp farming is over and done with. frankly, i see no reason to remove the datacore cost to be removed. it is a good isk sink in a game that needs more isk sinks, not less. (on that line, station s&i lines should have their operational costs increased 100x to create another quality isk sink, while also encouraging pos s&i!). highsec poco's have generally made highsec pi production cheaper, not more expensive. there is a skill to reduce npc taxes, and player taxes are quite often lower than the interbus rate. granted, in really busy systems, or in periods of conflict and flux, the reliability of a decent tax rate is questionable, but conflict is good!"
12/31/2013,"i never have, but inequality between gm punishment/actions is not ""irrelevant,"" that's a huge issue."
12/31/2013,"the caldari capitals are often the laughing stock of any dread/titan fleet due to their reliance on capital sized missiles that have easily mitigated damage. what if instead of just making them hit harder, we give the explosion of these massive missiles a level of aoe. of course we should consider the downside of having the aoe destroy the missile based fleet's own outgoing dps, as such we should have it affect only ships and drones.this could also be a balancing factor to the large sentry drone fleets we see out there. just an idea i had, maybe it's good maybe it isn't. but i believe it is a unique way to bring caldari dreads/titans into more use through a manner that isn't just ""hurf durf moar deeps lulz."""
12/31/2013,"for the same reason titan dd's dont do aoe damage2 reasons1) lag, alcualting the relative distance of everything to every missile adn factoring whether or not and for how much it would be damaged (especially since sig radius or what not is unique for every ship and pilot, not just ship-type) would strain the server2) it would make logi for the opposing side an absolute nightmare, as in larger warfare everyone would be getting hit, and this amount of damage compounded from a large fleet would over-tax logi quickly, making them to go-to doctrine for a fleet, this would compound with point #1 to provide unfavorable conditions for the server"
