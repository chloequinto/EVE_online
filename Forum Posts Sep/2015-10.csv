10/1/2015,"err...you do realise that ccp want us to do more of our own flying, not less, right?"
10/1/2015,nope.nope. nope. nope. nope. nope. nope. nope. nope. next someone would ask for a 'hit f1' option on the fleet menu.people should fly their own ships.
10/1/2015,firstly you really need better fleet members not a way round their incompetence and secondly what is so cool about being lumbered with doing someone else's flying?next thing you know you'll end up wanting to be able to lock their targets and shoot their guns for them.not supported.
10/1/2015,"next time, just leave them. repeat until irritation stops."
10/1/2015,"b)warp speed.conceptually, adding more differentiation to ships via warp speed was a wonderful thing; having them be faster or slower relative to each other makes lots of options open up, tactically and otherwise. 1)meta already punished big things, this was and is, basically sulfur in open wounds. yes, the warp rig changes were good, but there is still the lingering philosophical issue that you should not need to fit a certain way to make the ship viable. take fitting mods - you generally use these when you want to use something beyond the normal bounds of the ship, sacrificing slots that could be used in one way to open up fitting a bigger tank, bigger guns, or some sort of fiendish speed. getting around at a reasonable pace should not be considered something beyond the normal bounds of what ships were made for. yes, different speeds for different ships, but how slow the baseline is could use some adjustment. when travel becomes too much of a chore, it inhibits small gang/solo content, especially when people want to fly medium to bigger things that are self-sufficient, and need every slot to be able to up-engage. think of the charm of a solo battleship pilot charging into the barleguet of yesteryear, neither the pilot nor the response squad would probably have a bad time here. this needs to be supported more.2)modeling a successful new eden - interaction is its lifeblood. the more time people spend in systems where nothing is going on, the worse experience they will have. likewise, the more gangs they roam into, the more and more complex interactions they can have, and this usually results in a more eventful play session. play sessions they will remember and tell their friends about, you know? the sort of stuff that makes eve unique in that the combat does not take place within the bounds a staged arena. you definitely want the depth provided by variable warp speed, so that gangs can use interesting tactics to catch each other, but you don't want the base warp speed, or the warp speed of bigger things to be so restrictive that the become impractical. take, oh, black rise or syndicate, and assume you have 5 entities on at friday or saturday prime time - if all 5 ship into t3ds or light cruisers, their chances of engaging or even finding most of those other gangs is very high. if all 5 ship into heavy things, these chances are far lower; by the time they get a reasonable distance from home it's time to head back and fleet is over. multiply this by the spread of population all over new eden, and its no wonder that players are making choices they are. i completely understand wanting to reign in projection, but there needs to be a compromise here i think. the time in warp should be drastically cut down. its a downward spiral of content degeneration when every time you bring out big things, nothing happens (you know, those ships that were expensive isk wise and high sp requirements). you get the opposite effect if gangs continually find good fights in comps they enjoy flying. 3)veteran pilots do not want to be restricted to cruisers and down. yeah, i haven't really experienced the full impact of the bc changes yet, they look promising. even if they are much better and more relevant on grid, you still need to be mobile enough to find other people to play ball with, and warp speed sorta plays into that."
10/2/2015,"this. won't take long for the dead weight in your fleet to end up back at base via pod express. the plus side is, they only have themselves to blame, and if you keep track of where the fights actually happened, you can deny them any srp."

10/3/2015,"i think you are forgetting something.moon size vs. planet sizethe moon around earth is only ~16% the total volume of earth. also, mining moons beyond a certain point would become non-feasible due to the fact that they would loose coherence because of other gravitational influences (orbit issues from the star & other planets, and on themselves)as an example, lets use our moon as an example, ~12% iron. it would take an extraordinarily long time to mine out all of the iron on the moon, but it also would not be possible to mine out the entirety of it. the moon is in orbit at the distance it is because of the mass of it. it moves earth & earth moves it, as we orbit. now if we remove part of the mass of the moon, leaving it in orbit at the same kinetic energy level, it starts to go faster, meaning it pulls away more from the earth, or puts more force on it's own surface because of increased centrifugal forces. currently the movement is ~3cm per year, if i remember my pointless trivia right. that would increase, or we would see more falling rocks from the moon.now if mass is removed from one but the total energy is not changed, the object will speed up. e = ke + u. think of it like if you are spinning in a chair with your arms out, and then you suddenly brought your arms closer to you - you spin faster. then, if your spinning with a weight, and suddenly let the weight go, can you keep spinning in the same place?but, in reference, this would mean an increase in velocity of the moon, or that earth could not hold on to it as well. it would be a matter of statistical modeling to see if the moon would fly off or break apart first (from the potential increase in spin), and at what percentage of mass removed it would occur."

10/3/2015,"with regard to the comments on headshotting fcs being an issue; has anyone comsidered simply not showing the pilots name on the overview. that is a very strong piece of intel which is not necessary. ship names could be displayed instead, tags and broadcasts used to designate the target. i cant think of any military reason a pilot would want to share that intel."
10/3/2015,"still no mention of when t3 cruisers are going too get a nerf bat/ rebalance, its sooooo.. overdue and needed.links should be a permanent bubble (invisible) that buffs anyone inside it from say 50km upto 75km maybe, as the different types of links could have different ranges, say siege and armour links could be shorter ranged than the info and skirmish links."

10/3/2015,"it seems to me that despite module drop chance being a thing that hi sec crime is still very rewarding with nothing in the way of long term consequence for criminals (contrary to real society). i understand that since it's a game and subscriber numbers etc etc, that ccp wouldn't want to impose permanent consequences for crime, that's fine. what i think would be a wonderful gameplay mechanic, and give non-criminals a way to get back at hi sec criminals, is to have access to craftable dummy modules that you can transport in your hull to fool with the profitability of hi sec crime. for the sake of balance i can see it being reasonable to include a % chance of success at fooling ship scanners."

10/3/2015,"hello csm members and other pilots,as we are looking into forming an alliance with support corporations there does not seem to be an option to do that fully. in other words it is not possible to have a faction warfare alliance with e.g. industry corps that are not part of it. many alliances have build a workaround to create this similar thing. i simply ask if it's possible to create an alliance and let all corps fall under the same banner and choose if they want to take part in faction warfare or not. this would be better then creating 2 or more individual groups that are linked by chat channels and what not. pilots also have to jump from one corp to the other with all kinds of problems (such as waiting time, new roles, dropping roles etc). so please gives us more options when doing faction warfare and more options to try to stay under one banner.-elayae vin'dacar"
10/3/2015,"while i support the idea of separately joining fw instead of a global join (we have the same problem, as our school corp would appreciate to be a part of the main alliance but cannot, because gallente side woudl pretty much break logibros access to jita), i'm pretty sure it won't happen, because it would mean reworking the whole wardec system, which fw is based upon. and i expect it to definitely not be on the ""soon<U+FFFD>"" list."

10/4/2015,so the tribute system is... daily quests? really? and indeed it's an isk faucet i'm very disappointed that sugar kyle apparently doesn't know the difference between faction police and faction navy but still thinks they should be buffed.no mention of pinning lp payouts at tier 5 for kills? what's the holdup on that?
10/4/2015,"i'm also concerned about this tribute system. paying players extra, for being where they are and doing what they decided is worth doing, doesn't seem necessary. if certain content does not seem ""incentivized"" enough already, maybe increase loot or payouts?i could make this ""work"" in a way that doesn't inject new isk to the ecomomy, but it's convoluted, i offer the idea but don't really like it: a new tax and refund scheme. reduce rewards of loot or isk, depending on the dungeon being completed. don't advertise that this happened in-game, like an encounter surveillance system penalty. then pay back what was held back, as a lump sum tribute at the end of the day. some people irl enjoy and even set themselves up for lump sum payments, such as income tax refunds at the end of the year, letting their government treasuries hold onto their excess tax money, like a bank. and lotteries sell more tickets as the payout rises."
10/4/2015,"well, we know the pve plans at least... namely the tribute system.and i have to say, ""thanks but it won't work, because economy 101""if you artificially increase the monetary mass, prices adjust to the rise and inflation kicks in until purchasing power diminishes.if ccp tells the market that pvers are going to get a n% flat increase in their income, the market will mark up prices to exploit that extra income. this will mess with the purchasing power of people who don't do combat pve. can a miner buy a replacement exhumer if the price goes up proportionally to how much more are earning the level 4 runners? even worst, those who will be hit harder are the newer players, who don't have savings to afford higher prices and since they're running level 1s and 2s can't compete with prices marked up to the extra income for level 4s.i know it's everything in the air and very theorical still, but whereas the concept is good (reward player activity) the implementation looks catastrophically wrong since it appears to ignore some essentials of human behavior. you shouldn't start with a square wheel and then ""improve"" it so it turns better...i am a staunch highsec pver, and i don't need more isk. what i need are the mechanics to leave a footprint in the universe and generate pve content for me and other players, by playing my way."

10/4/2015,"it was mentioned in the fw/pve sessionshort version: first time you trigger dungeon completion (finish a mission, hack a site, clear an anomaly) you'll get a higher payout.(actually they're rated 1 to 5, if you do a 5, you'll get the 5 payout immediately. if you do a 1, you'll get the 1 payout, then do a 5, you'll get the 5 payout, minus the 1 payout. do another 5 and you won't get any other bonus)"
10/4/2015,"so we get a splash of isk when we complete the first dungeon of the day and the next ones pay nothing? well, that certainly would prevent inflation due to inceased revenue for pve as the increase would be neglectable."
10/4/2015,"ok, that's not so bad. sounds like a carrot to entice players to log in, on a day when they wouldn't normally log in. i don't think i would care, as a long term player. but it might be motivational for newer players. edit: it appears i misunderstood. if this is a bonus for every ""dungeon"" completion, i refer back to my comment in this previous post."
10/4/2015,"dust has rotating dailies, one of which is usually ""win one battle"" and rewards a key for their ridiculous lockboxes. other objectives include killing x amount of people, getting x amount of assists, that kind of thing. sounds like they want to do a similar thing with complexes in eve, complete x and get y. no idea why they think it will work. if content isn't worth undocking for now, a handful of isk isn't going to change that fact. sounds to me like a band-aid to cover the festering wound that is the rest of eve's content while they continue to fix null."

10/4/2015,"i think that the ""anti-faction"" missions should be more frequent in high-sec. i mean how are all of these supposed pirates safely setting up shop? maybe shift the ""kill pirate"" missions to low sec, where there is less concord?"
10/4/2015,"1. sure you live in w-space, mr. carebear. those pesky highsec gankers must really bug you there to make you post this thread.2. there are already relatively safe places for new players in eve. they are the rookie systems, and ccp takes a very dim view of people harassing new players in those systems.3. true new players will be totally uneffected by your idea, therefore your only reason for bringing them up is to attempt to derive an emotional backing by shouting, ""but think of the children!""4. criminals only have the advantage because carebears would rather whine on forums, trying to get the rules changed in their favor, than to take the required measures to ensure their own safety.5. what the highsec gankers have done is learn what it takes to minimize their risk. this is no different than you looking up a mission guide so you know what the triggers are and what resists you need to fit. in fact, considering most people who get ganked are not actively playing the game, i see very little difference between them and the npcs in your missions.6. easily computed profitability? seriously? two words for you, mr. carebear: loot fairy."
10/4/2015,"while i am for more information warfare gameplay, this proposal is just a straight nerf to pirates. it gives haulers a tool they can use at no real cost to themselves to make life as a pirate more difficult, something that has already been nerfed heavily in recent years. to make it balanced, such a mechanic would have to have a fitting cost so haulers have to choose whether to fit something that messes with cargo scans rather than just always toss a bunch of dummy modules in their hold. having that ability needs to come with a trade off against cargo capacity, speed and/or defense or it would offer no actual choice to a hauler to use it or not. further, there should be some counter to the mechanic that also requires a trade off for the scanner so they can see through the false information. so -1 as proposed. however, some additional cargo scanning gameplay, perhaps built around a revamp of the underdeveloped smuggling/contraband aspect of the game? sure."

10/5/2015,"thanks for the comments. i did read the minutes but i still didn't understand what they were talking about, but now i think i do. so this is going to be a sort of 24 hour cycle. it rewards logging in one hour per day as opposed to logging in for hours once per week. as for faction war. there wasn't much there. i am concerned about these patrols. i hope we don't go back to the days where npcs will be powerful and force militias to fit for pve, thus acting as a deterent to pvp. also tweaking npcs has proven to be a red herring. it's the actual pvp players who need better tools to make the sov game pvp focused. the four way war may invigorate faction war for the short term but none of the changes make the actual mechanics of fighting for sov more fun/pvp oriented. it seems that ccp forgot many of things they said they wanted to do in faction war to make it more fun and pvp focused. e.g., such as timer rollbacks and better intel tools. its not just a matter of warp core stabs. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
10/5/2015,"so did i understand it correctly? the fw goals from day 4:-suspect timer for entering plex-td3s out of small plexes-you can join fw even if your corp does not-decouple fw and standing-webbing npcs in missions-4 way war-using fw as testing ground for more intelligent ai and engaging pve generally all over eve(that is how i understand theese roaming patrols?)-not change any fw mechanic untill the pve test experiment is over.if this is the case then at least i know why fw and pve was in the same session i will give ccp the benefit of the doubt, and wait and see how this plays out. i am mildly disappointed and nervous though that at lot of the concerns that fw players and some of the csm raised, is basically answered by ccp with "" good point, but we won't look at it, because i am sure theese npcs will solve this""(npcs taking care of stabbed farmers ). i am not convinced this is the way solve the problems of fw. it still seems like the wrong medicine to me. naively one could think that having more people doing pve in fw space will lead to more pvp, but i think all the farming in fw has shown the opposite. fw people get tired of hunting people who do not want to be engaged. to engage in casual pvp is why a lot of people joined fw in the first place. out of interest does this resum<U+FFFD> of the fw session include all the discussion that went on about fw and pve, or are a lot of stuff omitted?"
10/5/2015,"someone just linked your post in a channel and asked me if you are my alt since we seem to fully agree with all points ;)at this point i am however not sure if ccp forgot about things or if they are intentionally ignoring them (both is possible, since the devs dealing with fw must have changed four times by now). as sidenote: null sov is getting timer rollbacks in one of the next patches, they only call the feature a little different."
10/5/2015,"fw plex acceleration gates should refuse ships with warp core stabs. these are dedicated combat sites not lp farming spots. if you want to farm lp go and do missions. is that simple. fights between opposing militias, fights for plexes should decide who owns the system not stabbed farmers. i really can't comprehend how this can not be fixed.the most sad thing in fw! >click<listed under business?? what do we talking about here?"
10/5/2015,"i'd like to be able to join any faction at will regardless of standing, i would also enjoy shooting at my own side a lot since that won't cause a problem with standings"
10/5/2015,we have both been asking for this for a few years now. here is the link were i quote ccp fozzie saying they still wanted to have rollbacks in october 2012. it just seems to have slipped through the cracks.
10/5/2015,"good changes with t3d's good making a daily login award. good making attempts at fixing fw missionsas a roleplayer i dont like the 4 way war thing. but i can see how it would bring more pvp into focus. bad letting players switch without standings hit. are you guys high? if you do this, then you need to loose -5 standings with the faction if you kill a friendlies. all this lets people do is hop militias killing new players the people your trying to save here. without any any consequences. if you do this you will find that role play in fw, will come to an end because we will literally be drained of isk, trying to maintain wardecs on every opportunity killer so we dont loose standing without our chosen faction.if your going to fix fw. bring back the god damn ************* battlecruiser restricted major complexes you just redid bc's and we need this bc plex back. please stop releasing new ships and just fix the broken stuff. interdictors blow to hard. t3 balance has been long overdue. logi is way to prolific"
10/5/2015,"j)suburbanization of lowsec. i can't find exactly the right word for this, but i'll stick to suburbanization. here's what i mean: since fozziesov, you have had lots of previously successful sov entities moving or breaking up into lowsec groups. the why is easy: lowsec is more content rich, much less of a logistical hassle, both in moving stuff and day to day operation, and has comparable or better income streams. this ties into other things i want to talk about, specifically about the entry bars to sov as they are, but it also tells a lot about what players actually want, and what sov actually offers them. again, if you can think of a better word, i'm totally game.lowsec has a ton going for it, especially for players who want to shoot at each other. i am actually curious on numbers of capital losses in wh/null vs lowsec, as it's pretty obvious where players are choosing to fight, some would say where game mechanics have forced them to fight. essentially, you have deep null where people go to pve in peace, and lowsec, which is a crowded content thunderdome. i don't like this at all, as distance combined with the phoebe changes has basically left entire regions all but impervious to attack, essentially condemning them as purely pve areas - they are for a particular purpose, which again is bad for a sandbox. one of the goals of fozziesov was to regionalize conflict - well it happened, but basically people collectively raised their hands and said lowsec is that region. so we get a concentration and the same sort of politics and alliance structures in lowsec as we used to see in null. sov has become territory you fill with newbies, renters, or newbie renters just to hold and maintain, protected by distance as much as anything, whereas lowsec has become the pvp zone. i really do not like having this partitioning of space where places are pseudo purposed for one particular activity. distances have to be shrunk a little bit to prevent this isolation and essentially zoning, and the bar for sov-holding is obviously way too high for a large majority of experienced players. even if more carrots are added to sov as more of these changes get implemented, what is likely to happen is people just sticking alts in the big null alliances, and keeping their main characters doing whatever - this is already happening. it shouldn't be that surprising though - people putting their pve characters in pseudo pve alliances holding pve regions just has so much synergy to it. i suppose some of this belongs under the income heading, but this partitioning of space mitigates so much risk as to be one factor in part of the economic woes we have now. holding sov now is more about pve than pvp, so again, you are going to attract vastly different crowds. lowsec will continue to grow and more and more ex-sov players will probably consider moving to the suburbs as their once proud hubs of pvp are transformed into glorified high sec. there's maybe a few sov regions which are actually functioning as models of aegissov, but these are far and few in between, and their success could largely be pinned on proximity to either low or npc null.still looking for a better term for this phenomena."

10/5/2015,"eve - e-sportsthere have been many worries (and justly so) about the future commitment from ccp to evesports after losing the neo tournament and the diminished format of the alliance tournament. i understand this completely however; the level of cost to ccp needs to be justified in its return or perceived value. evesports are important to the community as a whole, there is content for newer players in many forms but for those that have been around a little longer its tournaments and highly skilled events like this that still feed us that buzz and excitement eve online can deliver.the cold hard truth is; the future of evesports lies in our hands, us the players. some great examples have already been set in the past by rvb and i intend to build a network of like-minded volunteers with an excellent mix in skillsets to provide a viable future for evesports. despite ccp<U+FFFD>s budget having been cut for this side of eve there are many things that they can do to assist this merry band of volunteers at zero to low cost to the company. social media boosts of player-organised events and or prizes organised in the form of in-game items will boost the viability of these kind of projects and ensure the future of competitive eve gameplay.as the owner of #eve_nt collides and having a deep involvement with those in the competitive circles i feel i am very well suited to represent their concerns and work hard together with ccp on evesports future. as csm i further want to push to bring the competitive scene to eve and providing direct assistance to ccp to take advantage of the range of marketing opportunities at their disposal to allow those who are missing out on this game to see the light and become a pilot in the storied world of new eden. i've flown with and against nashh these last few years and have had many dealings with him, including several in-game events, and always found him to be dedicated and knowledgeable. he certainly gets my support as a candidate for the next csm council as an event and esports representative.-joffy aulx-gao - aba director, diplomat, csm candidatewhen nashh asks for two minutes he gives you 10.-bei artjay, producer #eve_nt collides#eve_nt collides is literally the worst -ccp logibro, tech on #eve_nt collides +1apothne - pl, crossing zebras#eve_nt website; www.eve-nt.uk blog;"

10/6/2015,"t3d are getting kicked out of small complexesthe problem is with the ship class, not where they can and can't go. it can be narrowed down specifically to the svipul, which is still quite broken. i'm actually fine with t3ds in smalls, but bringing their access in line with t3cs is still a good idea.fw missions are being reworked by ccp red dawnthere wasn't much to go on other than ""throw some webs at it."" removing bombers from the equation only encourages people to run missions in cloak-fitted ishtars, which are at even less risk than a bomber. nigh on invulnerable on gates thanks to the coak+mwd trick, by the time you've noticed them opening a mission, they've volleyed the npc off the field and are leaving system. you're also raising the bar significantly for new players, expecting them to shell out for a hac instead of a bomber. it would have made a lot more sense to make all of the racial missions runnable by bombers, especially since i believe only one race struggles to do so.fw based npc patrols are being addedwhile i like the idea as a bit of fluff, i fail to see how these convoys will act as a magic bullet for all of fw's woes. how exactly will these npcs deal with both high-sec gate camps and the swarms of stabbed/unfit farmers spread across both war zones? short answer, they won't.these convoy's will fight each otherthat's nice. how does that help anyone?allowing individuals to enroll in fw without the entire corp/alliance having to gojust no. why would this need to be a thing? so your alts can quickly dip in and farm some lp without screwing up their employment history? kill this quick.maybe making it easier to change militia with the standings stuff up to decoupling standings and being in the militia.see above. stupid idea. militia membership should mean something, not be an allegiance you throw away the moment your opponent looks more profitable. you should be encouraging people to stick with their militia, not making it easier for farmers to switch sides. this is ignoring the obvious blue-on-blue shenanigans that standing hits help to keep in check.4 way war between militia. it is a true 4 way war not just the removal of allies.without quick and easy access to their space, why should i care about capturing amarr/minmatar systems?suspect flagging when entering fw complexes. i've made my opinion quite clear on this already, so i won't repeat myself here.frankly, i'm disappointed. the level of ignorance displayed concerning fw by csm members is staggering. i don't believe i've ever heard anyone suggest combat ships should be prevented from fitting stabs. just what do you use your fw alts for if you think pvp here is the same as anywhere else? i think the brief discussion about lp made that quite clear.ccp fared little better. ""oh yeah, that's an issue, but we're not fixing it."" you never cease to amaze me."
10/6/2015,"i see this all the time in militia chat, someone new comes, is happy about giving intel about some enemies, trying to fleet up with others, going to most contested systems to fight .... hour later he finds out none really cares much ... never hear of him again"
10/6/2015,"if you care about rhat person its up to you to take them under wing. blaming the game for your apathy is silly.also, just remove fw missions from the game, stop enemy fw pilots from docking in hostile empire stations in low-highsec and remove any csm that thinks npc buffs are a solution to anything.."
10/6/2015,"crosi, this is not what is important to discuss right now in a csm minutes thread imho. i am afraid that this will derail the discussion and remove focus from the imo really important questions being asked. if the fw minutes contain all the conversation that was done in this session, i wonder why no one of the csm raised concern about ccp not having a long time plan for fw and its gameplay mechanics? just adding npc patrols and say it will probably fix things, should raise some kind of critique from the csm imo.i am also dissapointed about that people have used so much time thinking about how to improve fw, and give it to their respective csms and then so little of it is even discussed.ps. i appreciate the smaller changes like going suspects upon entering plex, but the lack of goals and direction for the future annoys me a little. best regards"
10/6/2015,"in reading these notes it is clear that ccp and csm are severely underestimating faction war<U+FFFD>s potential. the changes are not the worst but they demonstrate a lack of understanding the big picture with faction war and eve. the comments are focused on isk for new players. but people are not leaving eve because they can not make isk. they are leaving eve because there are no fun wars to fight. isk can only be used in game so the people no longer logging are not really going to care about it. but i bet many would care if eve suddenly had allot of fun pvp wars to fight in. ccp is clearly trying to shape mechanics in null sec to create fun wars for players. but the stakes of null sec and the will of the null sec leadership to make isk (as opposed to war) all make this a bit more challenging. faction war, on the other hand, is the perfect venue for ccp to really create a fun war where players can blow their isk fighting. what do i consider fun? frequent, quality, pvp engagements. how frequent? i think a faction war players who are fully engaged in sov warfare should be able to get about 10 decent fights in 3 hours of play. it is very disheartening to spend the time to get the isk, spend the time to figure out your fits and and fleet comps, and then you just spend another 2 hours online with few decent fights. good fights happen. but they are not frequent enough, and they often are just random with no context of achieving any sov war aims. what do i think is boring? having several alts orbit buttons ready to flee at the first sign of trouble. yet this is the best way to gain vp in faction war. and vp is the best metric to see who is winning the sov war. so currently, if you really want to win sov for your faction, then get alts out there. what can ccp do to make faction war sov more fun and exciting? they already said they would do it! october 22nd 2012 ccp fozzie said:"
10/6/2015,cearain thanks for remembering all those things and writing it down. i entirely forgot that we already had some devs on our side regarding timer rollbacks. i had it somehow wrong stored in memory and could not remember any direct dev replies on that topic.btw timer rollbacks in ageis sov for those interested
10/6/2015,it' makes me sad that nullsec gets rollback before fw. we were asking for it since years (2-3) still nothing. but i am very happy that nullsec is fixed. maybe we should stop asking for it and we would suddenly get it as well...

10/6/2015,"i've known and worked with nashh almost as long as i've been playing eve. from way back in the celebrity deathmatch days when i clobbered his myrm with my drake! the guy has a tattoo on his back that i designed for him. so needless to say we go way back. seriously though, i can't think of anyone i'd rather curse with a csm seat than nashh. he'll do an awesome job and represent all of us well on the council. he is easily bought and influenced, and will truly uphold the very best of our pirate traditions. no one can deny that he has a heart and a knack for eve and for in-game and out of game events, so his platform is one which deserves our support and more attention from ccp.nashh will be on my list this year."
10/6/2015,"was looking out for this one. nashh is an awesome bloke, and what can i say, i owe him one for shouting a taxi for me to get back to my hotel in the evening after helping set up for the first ever eve_nt. the scale of the event he's created from scratch shows exactly what this man can do. he has a good group of people that support him, and if anyone will give you a chance to speak to him about your ideas, it'll be nashh. he knows his game, particularly the low sec aspect, which is always good to have on a csm. he's a genuinely nice bloke, who always replies to my tweets and puts up with me asking him all sorts of things about eve_nt all the time. :p short of an alliance mate applying (highly unlikely), nashh will be my #1 vote, and he should be yours too."
10/6/2015,"yeah, no."
10/6/2015,"in my dealings with nashh through our crazy nullsec deployments and the at, he has been nothing but an awesome person to work with. i believe he has more then earned my support, as his platform is exactly what i want to expand and improve in eve. i have absolute confidence that nashh will be a cornerstone of the next csm and hope others share the same sentiment."
10/6/2015,"like many i cut my pvp teeth in lowsec, and still enjoy the odd roam/hunt around. from the few conversations we've shared outside of eve, i get the sense that he is someone who knows the difference between when to share views and press matters, and when to listen and take other views and ideas on board. his dedication to what drives him is pretty evident, and i'd be very happy to see that continue on as a member of the csm."
10/6/2015,that would be a great set of skills to bring to the csm. confirm that nash is a nice person to be on comms with.
10/6/2015,"fair enough. is why i invite people to bring questions and counterpoints. i took and will continue to take your comments seriously and reply accordingly. while i know of some of the main discussions you talk about, i recommend sharing links to specific talks. let others decide. or i can find links as well.it is a good opener for my campaign. shows how i approach issues and communicate. interestingly enough, my conversations with you actually inspired me enough to finally take the full step to campaigning to be part of the csm.actually here is the post and follow up conversation that made me decide to fully step up.i have no interests in hiding who i am. i am running to be part of the group that works with ccp to get the player feedback and opinions to them. it is a year i will not be playing eve. if and when csm appears by my name, then that will be my play. if there is an issue, i will take that issue on. see it from both sides. cannot do that if tied to a corp or alliance."
10/7/2015,"i refuse to give credence to a post by a throwaway character in an npc corp. grow a pair and post under your main, or keep your fingers off the keyboard keys."
10/7/2015,"but then again who cares about the credence that you refuse (or otherwise) to give, when we had a ccp representative confirming the motive of the op and even had the *man himself* crawling back from inactivity to report in with the developers."
10/7/2015,"op is known in russian speaking community (and gaming communities like eve-ru, goha) for his english-russian translations of various official devblogs, newsmaking and other related stuff. in a sense, he is more useful to the game than your ""main"" or your petty alliance."
10/7/2015,"oh c'mon. uax is sitting in csm only to have timely intel on sov changes and attempts to keep sov useful for current empires. i believe csm in it's current state is awful overall, not only due to uax"
10/7/2015,"okay. as former x.i.x member and uaxdeath voter(yes, i'm really vote for uaxdeath, blame me) i support topic starter's question: ""will you, uaxdeath, be active at csm and inform players of your activities?"""
10/7/2015,"thank you for the support <3 i agree that i was a little bit late during the last election, and i wished that i had put up my campaign thread earlier. so i decided to make sure to get out there much sooner this time around. it's still early, but i don't think there's a case of it ever being ""too"" early being early never hurt."
10/7/2015,nashh has an insane amount of energy he ploughs into projects all over the place. with a bit of luck a year on the csm will bring down to normal human levels and let the rest of us keep up with him.
10/7/2015,"well, this is good news, nash would be a real asset to the entire player base, he has great energy, and expertise and i am certain will give his all."
10/7/2015,nashh gave me a fantastic handy at eve_nt. he's got my vote.
10/7/2015,1
10/8/2015,"h)jump ranges and jump fatigue.jump fatigue fixed one thing, and broke several others <U+FFFD> these need fixes. the collateral damage is simply far too great. eve has literally gone from being a place where 100 man super fleets are omni-present within 15 minutes, to a place where it is better to self destruct capitals rather than move them. surely there is a goldilocks zone where things are reasonable, and we should aim to get there sooner than later.1)black ops.so i am completely unsatisfied with the current jump fatigue on black ops jumps and bridges. they are one of the few tools available to actually fight a much larger entity and at least garnish some token victories, or out harass large, bloated empires. one drop is like ~2 hours of fatigue if you jump back....and let's be realistic, any competent defender will make you do so. considering the extreme isolation that null affords, much of it multiple jumps away from any npc systems to stage from, blops really needs its fangs back <U+FFFD> the threat of a blops drop needs to be something that can be projected any place, at any time. guerrilla tactics are some of the only realistic ways to generate content between entities of grossly asymmetrical size, yet both the range and the frequency of jumps really kills good blops play. capitals aren't not supposed to be infinitely manoeuvrable, but blops are supposed to be extremely manoeuvrable, so i don't get why the hammer was pretty much thrown at both. i can understand not wanting to risk feeding projection more, but the defining aspect of the ship class was basically collateral damage when trying to reign in capital projection. what it did was make some regions totally inaccessible to blops, and make the play style about waiting...in a game about waiting. black ops ships themselves, i really do not find poorly balanced, but they could use the promised rebalance tweaks. they definitely do not not need tii resists <U+FFFD> manoeuvrability, damage, tank; pick two and you have a well balanced specialized ship, and they have extreme damage and manoeuvrability. giving them straight tii resists would make them hilariously overpowered. more scan resolution and sensor strength added to the base hull, slightly better fitting, or an overheating bonus for a set duration after jumping...anything to make them better at ambush tactics, but they are not meant to be toe-to-toe champions of slugfests, that is what marauders are for. you want them fast and high damage, but impractical for other roles. either the jump/bridge range needs to be extended, or the fatigue needs to be lessened to allow realistic use of mids/safes to hit areas that are farther away.2)movingyes, it was important to make carrier apex forces not infinitely motile, but moving to new areas is currently....terrible. the ratio of work to content is just becoming excruciating, causing many to just give up. you sort of know there's something wrong when it is just better to mass-self destruct a capital fleet and buy another one, rather than try and move it. the same applies to moving sub-caps to new locations. in an age when you are trying to make sov empires vibrant, malleable, and shifting, it is hilariously bad in my appraisal to make the act of moving to new space to miserable and taxing. sticking your sov-aspirants with yet another bar to entry, yet another reason not to try and live in sov null, is not conductive to building or showcasing the play style. space is literally just too big now, much better of an idea to just shack up in lowsec where most things will be accessible.3)local capital over-dominance, hyper-localization, invent your own buzzword.this one is pretty easy. in a world where capitals are bound to at most a ~10ly radius, contesting local capital power, particularly in deep null, is basically impossible. this hurts people looking for capital content, makes their use in deep null extremely hard to punish, and makes local capital bullies hard to deal with in certain areas. basically, movement is so restricted that meaningful interaction is greatly inhibited. yeah, a spate of big fights happened in quick succession when the all seeing eye of super blobs was blinded, which is good, but other areas are on the other end of the spectrum. pretty much the only places where dropping capitals is risky is in and around lowsec where the population and system density is high enough. i suppose some of this is pending the capital re balance, but generally if a ship is undocked, it should be vulnerable, and i just don't feel this is the case with the size of the map vs the range of capitals. capitals need a tad more projection <U+FFFD> not too much, just enough to let groups play sheriff on other groups capital usage. 4)more npc null pockets are needed. one of the reasons for this is to allow actual capital movement between regions and make more places accessible to move through or move to. generally npc pockets lead to much more interesting times for local sov-holders; with how big the universe is now, and with the recent wh nerf, actually getting at people and providing a healthy amount of risk is a bit of a challenge logistically, whereas these would really help. i do think the jump ranges and times are way too strict, but a few well placed systems could really accelerate movement my making more direct travel paths."
10/8/2015,i think it is positive that you have a lot of experience in eve and that you want to represent players no matter where they are based in new eden. and working in the it industry i think would be a real advantage in understanding the devs point of view. that you are a fantasy author is also a plus!
10/8/2015,"i tried to read this, i could not. might want to redo this"
10/8/2015,"if you don't know nashh... he's an amazing beacon for connecting people in the eve community - ingame and in real life - especially through his organisation of the eve_nt meetup. his corp is a familiar name if you're based in lowsec, and rightly so. i've had the pleasure of meeting nashh and his alliancemates on several occasions.i can honestly say that csm xi would be a hell of a lot stronger with nashh on-board. his ability to reach out to the eve community, coupled with his integrity and his passion for this game and its players make him an excellent csm candidate.i have no doubt that he will listen where the community speaks, and speak on the community's behalf rather than for himself. something which so many csm candidates have failed to achieve in the past.good luck nashh [#rekkingcrew]"
10/9/2015,"subtlety increases immersion on a grand scale. the subtle interactions on stations, the ""back-room"" or ""back alley"" dealings would take on a whole new meaning. and the reaction to other players based on standings would be pretty ****ing cool.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
10/9/2015,every time i turn around somebody is either leaving or being kicked from the csm. maybe it's time for somebody consistent to have a seat at the table. it's time for xenuria.
10/9/2015,last i checked csm members aren't paid by ccp. so they aren't employees
10/9/2015,"this is like being in the cafeteria of the esl school where i work, watching the students fight."
10/9/2015,"i can confirm after personal experiences flying alongside nashh and meeting him in person, that he has a very welcoming personality and engages very well with eve community and others. always there to listen and give a hand, i have personally witnessed him in placing the best interest of others ahead of his own and always offering to assist when and where possible.further in my experiences working with him as part of the #eve_nt collides team, he again displays his nature as well as immense energy for putting the community and others first and providing for them. using the collides platform as another way to provide and address what the eve community want.for that i lend my support to nashh."

10/11/2015,"hi all, i would like to bring up a matter that i think its very important. not long ago i have been the victim of a scam when i was trying to buy a supercarrier and i am sure that i am not alone on this. now buying a supercap its serious business because they cost a huge amount of isk. the super caps are the only ships in the game that cannot be bought on a normal market and there for it attracts scammers. i also do know that there is a system of so called <U+FFFD><U+FFFD> third party<U+FFFD><U+FFFD> that will ensure the player to player transaction and that there are a few players with a proven track record of securing these super cap transactions but are we safe? the answer is no because even them can one day stop being trustworthy and scam you..it will be happening once because after that his reputation will go down but still...on that day you can loose as much as 100 bil. so what i propose is a safe way of buying super caps...which could be done in several ways. one of them i am going to present to you here today:in high security space in every major trade system a super massive station where any alliance that has a toon with the requiered skills regardless if they have sov. or not can come and build super caps and put them up for sale. any super cap undocking in that system will not be able to shoot their guns nore deploy any king of fighters or fighter bombers but only be able to jump into the nearest low sec or null sec to a special covert cyno that only super caps can lock onto and only from the high security space.the way super caps are built and sold needs to change. give the small alliances the power to build their own super caps or buy thier super caps in a safe way.i urge ccp to make this change because i think i have a strong case.looking forward for replys"
10/11/2015,"chribba. just saying. cribba is safe, and if you don't want to use a third party, you deserve to be scammed."
10/11/2015,chribba. just saying. cribba is safechribba is not safe as long as hes got the free will to turn around anytime he wants to say thats it ..your 100 bil is mine now.
10/11/2015,"[/quote] if you don't want to use a third party, you deserve to be scammed.[/quote]what do you mean? a third party is not safe all together why would i want to use it? as long as the posibility exists its not safe.i would really like to hear the opinion of people that got scamed already."
10/11/2015,"has this ever happened and just how likely is it? bearing in mind he makes far more being honest, than breaking his word and never being trusted again. so no.edit: oh and reported. please don't cross post.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
10/11/2015,i cannot stress this long enough....as long as you cannot buy a super on a market safely just like everything else and the posibility to get scamed exists its not safe
10/11/2015,"have you at all considered the possibility of, ""that's the point.""you are trying to buy something that is, for all intents and purposes, an alliance level asset. it is not supposed to be easily moved, sold, or stored.-1 for this idea. being a trusted 3rd party trader is good profession and a good example of how reputation is supposed to matter in this game."

10/11/2015,so your point is that you want to be able to build or buy a giant space coffin without having to risk yourself or your alliance?nope.for the same reason you can't have a poco or pos without having a corporation... or build/buy regular capitals without being in low/null-sec... or own sov without having an alliance...or build a supercap without owning sov...or buy a supercap without having to go through 3rd party traders...if you want more powerful assets... you have to put yourself at increasingly higher levels of risk and the possibility of failure.this is a theme in the game. get over yourself. you are no more entitled than i am to score a kill... or mine in safety... or not fall prey to scams... or have the market manipulated under you... or not be gouged out... or have your way of doing things disrupted... etc.
10/11/2015,"everything you mentioned above, apart from the section <U+FFFD><U+FFFD>or buy a supercap<U+FFFD><U+FFFD> has nothing to do with the subject in talks also erelevant so no point in bringing them up because they cannot be examples to your pointless say, and i<U+FFFD>m gonna explain why.none of your examples above have any relevance to the danger of being scamed for 20 bil isk to 100 bil isk ok?"
10/11/2015,"you can. the same way anyone else can: take sov, get the strategic index up far enough, install the relevant ihub upgrades, put a csaa on a pos and build your super.why should you be able to build the things in complete safety, let alone trade and store them?"
10/11/2015,because my alliance is not big enough to take sov. and it will never get big enough to take sov. thats my point why shouldn<U+FFFD>t small alliances be able to build thier own supers? why only the big allinaces should have that power?
10/11/2015,anyone that wants to know more about joffy's character take a moment and read this post:

10/12/2015,"other thread was locked, this one is/was a duplicate."
10/12/2015,"i cannot state enough how strongly i support joffy's run for csm. this fellow is active at super-human levels, always participating in this event or organizing that event. his dedication, loyalty, humility and openness have made him an invaluable asset to aba as an alliance, and to the eve community as a whole."
10/12/2015,"greetings to all of new eden,my name is kyle aparthos, and i have finally made the decision to run for csm xi. as some of you who read tmc (or cz) may know, i have been writing and publishing columns about the state of eve online under the moniker of ""opinionated analysis"" for some time. where we were, how we got to where we are, and where we might go from here. if you haven't read any of those, and you're still interested in what i have to say by the time we get to the end of this post, then here are a couple examples.to condense a whole lot of long-winded writing into a few short statements: i am an analyst, writer, (currently retired) diplomat for spacemonkey's alliance, and general guy who goes out and talks to lots of people and gets their opinions on things. most relevant to the csm is my ongoing role as an analyst who studies the mechanics of eve online in a very in-depth sense, publishing diatribes and making suggestions for the future. as a result of this role i have gained quite a lot of analytical experience, especially pertaining to eve mechanics beyond just the surface level of ""this sucks and i don't like it because it inconveniences me.""this has been especially useful when combined with the communication skills gained from all the time spent talking to people on platforms ranging from sma comms (where people love me) to reddit (where people hate sma and thus it takes a little more effort to note be hated by association).over the course of my career, as a result of many of these roles, i have gained a fair bit of insight into group interaction, as well as how medium and large groups have reacted to the changes to eve over the last year. ultimately this leads to me having a solid knowledge of how to put player behavior together with the actual mechanics of the game. my experience has led me to believe in two things: that player agency, both at the level of the individual and the group, is the single most important aspect of eve. that player agency can only be enhanced through combining ""little things,"" (quality-of-life changes to be exact) and broad, sweeping alterations to the game. as a result, when i examine announced changes to eve, my primary concern is how groups of players will react to these changes. the human element, as it were. i feel very strongly that many members of our community have focused too heavily on analyzing these changes from a mechanical perspective only - how the mechanics fit into one another and trying to make the people fit into the mechanics, rather than give equal weight to both the mechanics and the players using them. because of this belief, i am basing my campaign on the notion that player cooperation is the mainstay of eve, be it in huge alliances or smaller groups. more importantly, all of these groups deserve a greater sense of agency and individual involvement, and more tools to further their personal goals, no matter how large or small the group is. while there are a huge number of different ways to achieve this goal, i shall (at least initially) focus on a few of these in my campaign:[continued in next post]"
10/12/2015,"[continued from previous post]one: alliance-level management deserves some love. currently, just about every medium-to-large alliance must rely on out of game tools in order to support themselves. some of these out-of-game functions, such as teamspeak servers and alliance websites, are spectacularly useful and hard to emulate. however, alliance leadership also finds itself forced to utilize out-of-game tools for such tasks as blacklist management, tax collection (for those who do so), and srp. in addition, the existing in-game mechanics such as role management and hangars simply do not exist in any fleshed-out state at the alliance level. i firmly believe that if we can overhaul and add to the number of in-game tools available to prospective alliance leaders, both old and well-established alliances, as well as those who are struggling to get off of the ground, will prosper.two: player customization of space should be an integral component of the investment in sov. while the upcoming structures due to be released in spring of 2016 are slated to be usable just about anywhere, some of their possible functions (specifically, those proposed at fanfest 2015 that would allow for serious customization of space, such as alteration of security status, rat type, and warp speed within a system) should be specific to players who have invested in their space. not necessarily invested a boatload of isk, but rather invested their time and effort in acquiring a sov system, and living in it and defending it. the more time and effort you put into your little slice of paradise, the more you should be able to customize and alter it to suit your particular playstyle, so long as those customizations are still occupancy-dependent . this would allow the ability to utilize, enjoy, and defend your space to be more dynamic than simply ""how much have you ratted and mined in your space in the last week, and how high is its strategic index,"" while simultaneously retaining the underlying theme of occupancy sovereignty. three: players should have multiple different avenues for taking and holding space. as i detailed in one of the columns linked above, while fozziesov certainly has its merits and i am not advocating for a return to dominion sov, i do not believe that entosis links should be the only method of sov acquisition. this is especially pertinent given the current usage of entosis links to destroy sov structures outright: it simply does not make any logical sense in my mind that a sov lazor should be capable of making a huge structure detonate. as a result, i think that ccp had the right idea with how they treat stations currently: entosis links cause the station to flip once all levels of node contesting have been completed. with the announced return of a partial structure grind to destroy the new structures, it is my belief that the most reasonable way to proceed with sov is to allow entosis links and node contesting to be used to capture structures, and the limited structure grinding to be used to destroy them. when combined with the different force multiplication tools that are possible with the new structures, this produces a much wider variety of ways to engage in sov warfare, and thus more ways to engage the player base. in short: we have succeeded in making sov somewhat more accessible in that an enormous blob of supers is no longer required to hold your space. however, we have not made either holding sov or fighting for it much more engaging at all. the updates that the next year holds must make being part of an alliance, sov or no, more engaging for everyone involved.if you're interested in getting in touch with me to share your ideas, comments, or concerns, you can contact me in-game at kyle aparthos, via tweetfleet slack under the same name, or via reddit.i hope to hear from you guys soon :d"

10/12/2015,"you do know that structures won't be affected by entosis, right? (not talking about sov structures. things like citadels)"
10/12/2015,"i do know that as of the latest devblogs on the topic they are not slated to interact with entosis links.what i'm saying is that they should, but not in the way that current sov structures do. rather, the new structures (assuming that they are all destructible like citadels) should be captureable via entosis and destructible via the already-outlined dps method.i'd like to think that such a system, if done right, would offer multiple different avenues for sov warfare and thus make the process a little bit more nonlinear/interesting. if you're interested in reading more about this idea, even if solely for the purpose of telling me why it's a dumb idea, i encourage you to read the 2nd page of this column."
10/12/2015,"i just don't see a reason to vote for you. there is nothing that stands out that says, hey, we need this guy on the csm! sounds harsh, but it's the truth. i've read some of your stuff, but it is rather bland. not to mention i had to put up with that eye cancer web layout you continue to blog at - tmc. the other things that can't be ignored is you are part of the cfc, the worst offending coalition that prides itself on keeping the status quo when null desperately needs more things to shake it up to break up the cancer that is giant coalitions. you brag that sma is a force to be recorded with, but everyone knows sma has been nothing but cannon fodder for cfc since the beginning and would wither away and die before the sun set on their first day on their own in null. sma couldn't win a coin toss on their own.not to just bash on your alliance, but we need people with fresh ideas to help put eve back in the fun zone and grow. you simply have nothing to offer."
10/12/2015,"so what would your response be to someone who asked why a person who actively sold his alliance mate out and straight up lied in a article on tmc to appease the goons, and then instantly back tracked. why would we want someone who so clearly lacks a back bone on the csm?"
10/13/2015,"joffy our hero! i will have a tiny ballot and this guy obviously gets my #1. genuine and considerate, can trust your vote there."
10/13/2015,"so, i've responded to this one about a thousand times before, but not usually in such a public forum:the evidence placed on my desk at the time showed that he was in fact a defector, and i agreed with his purging with a heavy heart. privately i was as close to heartbroken as you can get over a space video game, though publicly i honored my obligation as a reporter who was on the scene at the time, and reported based on the evidence and statements that i had in front of me. less than three days later, new evidence showed up that exonerated him - i was one of the first in line banging the pots and pans calling for his exoneration, and i could not have been happier when sma leadership as a whole agreed that he deserved a full apology and a reversal of the previous decision. i have, quite frankly, never been so ******* happy to be wrong in the entirety of my eve career and the first thing i did when rayonar got back onto our ts was pull him aside and beg him to forgive me for making the mistakes i did. the second thing i did was immediately go over to tmc and write a retraction of my previous statements. i had a ridiculous smile on my face the entire time i wrote it because i got a chance to make things right and not lose a friend.rayonar was, and remains, a very good friend of mine. as far as i'm concerned, if he managed to find it in his heart to examine the words coming out of my mouth and determine that i was worthy of his forgiveness, then why should the rest of eve make a shitshow out of it?"
10/13/2015,"hi, pilot in question.this stigma really needs to end. i've grown very tired of everyone outside of the imperium even pretending they know how this all ended. let's go ahead and try to end this entire political nonsense right here and now: mistakes were made, and we will probably never be able to live down what happened. but, the sad fact remains that regardless of how little it comes up, 95% of the time, it comes from an outside entity that would just use it as 'grr gons' fuel until they turn red in the face.i'm honestly super tired of hearing about it. i will in no way ever change the stance that in my 10+ years of mmos, i never had a worse few irl days from a video game. but let's go ahead and end some notions like i was cold shouldered by everyone in the imperium, let alone sma. blarf, the skymarshal at the time, reached out to me within 12 hours of it happening. he tracked me down on skype personally to touch base, and to get dialogues started on what exactly happened as he wasn't present at the time. kyle, widget zombie, various other sma directorate (the brothers specifically), and countless others were on my side and had my back, and support. for every one person that even believed what happened wasn't bullshit, there was a herd of others than didn't. kyle, to this day, apologizes to me for having to write the article. i'm not mad at him. really, i'm not. people act like i should be gutting him and spreading his entrails over the streets. it get's boring when people decide how mad or upset i should've been. kyle, again, to this day, still receives threats outside of eve, harassment, all sorts of ****, over an article. for a video game. with these things said, to base someones entire candidacy on a single mistake that he openly regrets to this day, and has worked hard to move past, is pretty narrow. you're openly avoiding the fact that he is very well versed and informed in this game, despite not being a 5+ year bitter vet player, just to turn about and **** on him for 'grr gons' and 'lol sma burned his friend'.i would vouch for kyle for csm regardless of whatever the outcome was. he's proven to be a great neutral ground on almost everything he's written article wise, something most people pitching for csm should probably take note on these days. guy does his research, and isn't afraid to approach something from different angles that people refuse to chance, to look terrible in public eyes. guy has a lot more spine than the people that harass him, as far as i'm concerned.tl;dr - stop digging up the past, didn't happen to you, and i don't really care any more. i'd vote for him instantly, especially based on his knowledge, ability to learn, and his willingness to compromise on most topics that most people just don't care to do more than bury their head in the sand on."

10/13/2015,"i think it is absolutely appalling that there exists alliances that empower a person such as digi. someone that knows no bounds on where the meta should end. he is in fact the one who claimed you were a spy and thus, cfc blindly following his every word, had your titan killed. you seem to support such actions with no shame, same as op who is wanting to be on the csm.unfortunately for you, and op, guilt by willing association with such scum is something the player community does not need on the csm. i fear that you and op have been under the yoke of the cfc for so long you have stockholm syndrome and can't see the evil that transpires in front of your noses. digi survives because cowardly players feed him information on other players that he uses against them in and outside the game world.break your ties with the cfc and stand on your own. cast aside trash like digi and then, maybe then members from sma could be seen as a legitimate candidate for the csm and not just another sock puppet.i mean how do you think this image was made?"
10/13/2015,"that's not an sma problem, that would be a goons problem. if they continue to support digi, than that is there prerogative, not ours. yes, he claimed i was a spy, turned out he was wrong, eh? but it turns out i wasn't, and my assets were replaced, and i got back to doing the things i wanted to do.guilt by association is easily the most half-assed excuse for not liking someone. just because i'm in the general area of someone you don't like, i'm as bad as said person? pretty awful. we walk amungst criminals daily, yet we're not labeled for what they do. the stockholm syndrome line is also very old and boring. i love how everyone just can't get over the fact that i wanted to continue to help an alliance that i'd been a part of for many years grow, above all else. you're a member of brave, who has collapsed and rebuilt countless times over endless drama, and yet you don't see me calling you a masochist, because some people do have the respect for someone who has the willpower and charisma to keep a good thing going, where others would call it mental illness out of spite.in respect to my friend who actually wants a chance to make this run, i will no longer be posting in this thread. if you want to argue your personal gripes with me, eve-mail me. i really don't care to see this level of sperg on an open forum. but since you want it, here it is. enjoy it, i guess. otherwise, reach me by other means."
10/13/2015,this may actually been the nicest thing i've ever heard you say. i really appreciate knowing at least one person has this opinion of me <3
10/13/2015,"kyle, you're a great guy and have done a lot for us. i really love your articles on tmc and support you. some people may only see cfc and ""grr goons"" and that's fine, that's how they choose to see the game. but some of us don't let that get in the way of seeing the people behind the character. sma has amazing people, and you're one of them. #kyle2016"
10/13/2015,"nashh is likely going to be number one on my ballot for csm11.the perspective that he holds is one that is desperately needed on the csm, and someone with his depth of experience could do wonders for this game as a whole by being apart of the council. best of luck nashh, and if you need any advice or have any questions regarding the csm, please don't hesitate to ask.+1"
10/13/2015,i once had the pleasure to listen to nashh after a sweet kill in our home area ramble on about some other eve story and i didn't want to sign off until i heard it all. i don't really know this person much or about the event related things but he sounds really level headed and gets eve. i support this.
10/14/2015,"i'm no fan of sma, the brother's specifically i hold in great contempt for reasons that will become apparent if you ask them about my corp. but trying to hold the whole rayonar thing above kyle's head is pretty damn childish. i wish you the best of luck but as long as you are affiliated with sma and the brothers i cannot in good conscience vote for you."
10/14/2015,"si are non goon cfc members still pretending that they don't direcctly benefit from digis blatant doxxing, and that he doesn't also dox their own members?"
10/14/2015,"to be honest it has nothing to do with pretending. i literally don't remember the last time that digi was involved in anything to do with an sma member - he was only tangentially involved even with the rayonar business, and that was the one time during my tenure as a member of sma leadership that i saw his name crop up on my desk. as rayonar already explicitly stated, digi is a gsf member, not a member of sma. what digi chooses to do with his time has nothing to do with my work in sma. and more to the point, my work inside sma has nothing to do with my csm campaign, other than that my time working as a diplomat has exposed me to thousands of people and i have learned something from listening to so many people talk about how they feel about eve, which is hardly sma-specific.i am not campaigning as ""sma guy who wants to advance sma agenda."" i am campaigning as ""analyst, diplomat, columnist, and guy who tries to solve problems through reasoned discourse."" so, with all due respect, i think it is fair to ask that critiques of my campaign come from my ideas - there is certainly no shortage of writing available where i have been very open and honest about what ideas i have for the future of eve. in fact, i continue to publish new ideas at least once per week. so rather than examine me from some preconceived notion that an sma candidate must be a ""dirty goon puppet,"" examine the ideas that i have put forth and shall continue to put forth. i promise you won't find any shortage of material upon which to base your opinion."
10/15/2015,"in order to retain and reflect some of the eve style gameplay in wis, like player interaction and areas with different content (like the different secs), there could be different sectors in a station. i think that there could be three sectors, but not with functionality like high, low and null, beacuse the point is not to make eve again with a station setting. it is better that it adds something to the experience of eve as a whole. another layer for more possibilities.though wis should be optional to take part in, the natural goal with wis should be to improve the experience in eve both for pvp and pve. one thing i think is beneficial is easier interaction with other players that are outside your corp or alliance, because unless you are in a big corp, chances are that there will be times when you are the only one on or that you are in another part of the galaxy with too little time available to travel. random interaction with others isn't really possible in space as talking in local usually isn't advised in many systems. but being in the same station, it is much easier to suggest for example participating in fleets together, on an in-station channel where you know the others are docked in the same station. you have of course the guest list today showing those docked, but there isn't a channel for those. the idea isn't that you have to walk up to someone, as you can just broadcast your message on the in-station channel, but with people's personas visible you could probably get some idea of what kind of people they are and if they are busy with other things. or another way is that you could put yourself on a list for interest in different fleets, with preferred mission type and experience desired from those wanting to join you. i think it would be better for making random fleets and in that way make some more interaction without having to be in a big corp or alliance.another thing is that wis could reflect the activeties in space and put them in a context. in other other words the choices you do in space will affect you here, be it positively or negatively. that could be such things as which npc missions are available to you and visibility of rewards. more connection with the eve world is a use too. many of the entries about stations that are in the lore are just there. though i enjoy to read about it and imagine it, to see it visualized would be interesting.there could be three types of ""sectors"" in a station, where one is a tie-in with legion, if that is coming. part of the point of having several of these sectors is to make station gameplay interesting on a wider level, and in that way make fis more interesting as well, because of the connections.the first part is an area for sociality. the air in this area is appropriate for capsuleers, and so mainly the ones you meet here are other players. except for maybe service personnel, like someone attending the bar. the lighting is relaxed and soft, perhaps with some slow shifting of colours. here you also find shops for apparel.the next area is an area that is a basis for pve in space. here you meet npc's offering storyline missions not found through the agent finder and npc's telling you about ship and fleet tactics, and some npc's just telling you some general news. information screens shows relevant news. the point of this place is to get special missions that were activated through completing certain pve missions involving security, mining, exploration or faction warfare in space, and as a place for learning more about new eden, the political issues, cultural and trends, flying and ship tactics. being in parts of the station not designed for capsuleers, one has to wear a suit to be in these areas, both for air and security. despite this, capsuleers want to show their uniquness to station residents, so the suits have changed to be more than just necessity, instead to be more design oriented or even to be intimidating. though pve focused, this is not a single player area, so you could interact with other capsuleers just as in the capsuleers areas.the ""legion"" part is naturally for pvp, but different to what you see in dust. these are in spaces of the station not, currently at least, supervised by station security. here are buying and selling of contraband items. these areas are lootable pvp though, so it would be necessary to have a dust type soldier there. can you get in or out to buy or sell the items you want, before someone take you down? i guess all areas should have some restrictions on the number of people in one area, so to make it technically more achieveable."
10/15/2015,"i'm going to have to disagree with op.i'm against cyberbullying, but ganking does not fit the definintion of cyberbullying. losing spaceships in a spaceship combat game is not bullying.stretching the definition of cyberbullying so far out of whack so that you can squeeze hi-sec ganking in eve into it does nothing but cast a shadow of ridiculousness over the subject and cause harm to the effort to fight cyberbullying. please don't take a serious issue like this and turn it into a laughing stock by misapplying the label to things that should not have such a label attached.do some research on actual cyberbullying cases and see for yourself how ridiculous it is that you would even attempt to categorize hi-sec ganking as cyberbullying."
10/15/2015,dude.... what? you are ridiculous.i don't think in any court in the usa anyone is going to penalize someone for ganking ships in eve. get freaking serious. you would never even make it to court. the prosecuting attorney would likely laugh in your face.learn what actual bullying is and shut your hole.
10/15/2015,"this.seriously, if you're feeling hurt over losing a ship in a video game, you need to turn off the game and get a grip on reality."
10/15/2015,"so, i have been fairly frustrated with evelopedia, which i would point out appears to be ccp's official wiki, as it is on the eveonline.com domain.much of the information in the evelopedia is outdated and contains many innaccuracies.when googling for information, many links are found to evelopedia, and as it is ccp's site (or so one would surmise), one would expect to get accurate information from this resource.the fact that it shows up near the very top of google searches and contains bad information is a serious ""here is your rubik's cube, go f**k yourself"" to the new players who are trying to find information about the game they are playing. having a terribly, or not at all, maintained resource out there cannot be good for new player retention, and even as a player with a few years under my belt i find it annoying and nearly worthless, as i have to fact check everything i find in this wiki.would the csm please consider leaning on ccp to make some sort of effort at updating evelopedia when changes are implemented in the game, or just get rid of the damn thing.if i misunderstand how evelopedia works, and it is supposed to be community updated, then that is a failure of concept in the first place and should be addressed.no matter what the case, that site is not doing anyone any favors by giving outdated and false information.for the love of bob, please think of the new players!"
10/15/2015,"you can make edits to the wiki, right?"
10/15/2015,"that is what i'm not sure about. which is why i mentioned that i didn't know if it was supposed to be community maintained.the point is that it is not maintained, appears to be a ccp product and not everyone understands the wiki process. so, either an effort should be made to maintain it, or it should go away. bad info is worse than no info.and seriously, it wouldn't take much more time than writing a devblog for ccp to edit changes. considering that there is no manual for this game, that site is the closest thing we have, and its in really bad shape.maybe i should push for a community effort to get it cleaned up? dunno.also, it would need active community participation on a constant basis to ensure that what is being edited or added is actually correct. you know this community as well as i do, and i'm sure you can see the possible train wrecks in allowing players to maintain it."
10/15/2015,"again, you are able to make changes to the evelopedia yourself. find the entries you know stuff about, and change them. not difficult at all."
10/15/2015,"you can edit many pages within the wiki.so, you should use your frustrations to correct faults that you find. start fixing the wiki, then come back and say ""hey csm, i'm fixing this wiki all by myself. it's a big job, and i'd like some help."" people will listen to you that way. don't cry about a problem you're not willing to have a part in fixing."
10/15/2015,has ccp games discussed this new plan of theirs with the csm ?source:
10/15/2015,"my guess is yes they have. seeing as the majority of csm members in that thread so far, are against it.in fact, isn't it all of them so far?destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
10/15/2015,"joffyi'm glad to see someone from low sec running.you mention a few things about faction war. there have been 2 things that players pushed for and ccp said they would do years ago to encourage pvp in faction war plexes, but they never did. those 2 things are timer rollbacks, and better intel tools so we can defend plexes. preferably the latter would be some sort of intel tool that would allow faction war pilots to have real time intel on where plexes are being taken so they can go defend the plex before the timer expires. here is a post that discusses this a bit more in detail:"
10/15/2015,"hello cearaini'm glad you came with constructive feedback.i've lived in factional space the last 2 years as a pirate shooting everybody so i'm aware of all those farmers and i want to somehow make it better to fight for your plex than run away, whether it's timer rollbacks or rewarding pvp more, something has to be done.i'm a bit unsure about the intel thing because if it will be tied to notifications every guy in fw will be spammed to hell and back, it will not be much else than annoying.if you got time one of the upcoming days feel free to convo me ingame. i'd love to hear more ideas and feedback.joffy aulx-gao"
10/15/2015,"thanks for the response joffy. i think the intel may have been through the use of the map as opposed to notifications. i don't really care how they do it. if people wanted to turn off (or filter the notifications to be within a certain jump range) that would solve the problem of spam. imo it doesn't matter how they deliver the intel. i certainly agree not everyone in faction war would use this intel. but those who like to fight for sov definitely would. imo ccp needs to follow through with their promises on both of these measures so rabbit plexing can be constrained. that is the key to making fighting for sov fun. and i strongly suspect eve would do much better if there were some fun sov wars to fight in as opposed to just random pvp. giving people rewards for pvp (in an unexploitable way) is unlikely to change much. but it wouldn't hurt. i'm happy to talk about all sorts of faction war proposals and topics but imo most of them won't change very much. the two proposals i mentioned are the most important proposals to change fw sov warfare from the fightless alt grind it currently is. i would be interested in knowing if ccp still would like fw sov to be won by pvp or if they are happy with the current alt rabbit plexing system. they seemed pretty content from the csm x minutes. btw the top 3 vp gainers for faction war in the last week are:1. orn lorn2. monk-black fast3. xfleuryxi can't post killboard links but feel free to look these guy's killboards up yourself. vp is gained when you complete a faction war plex it will either increase the amount the system is contested if you run offensive plexes or it will decrease the contested level if it is a defensive plex. so these ""warriors"" did the most to help contest or uncontest systems for their faction. is that the vision?i get the stats here:"
10/15/2015,
10/15/2015,
10/16/2015,well its a wiki
10/16/2015,sup joffy you have my votes.
10/16/2015,
10/17/2015,"option nr. 2, please."
10/17/2015,"silver dagger kondur,thank you very much for posting your support to this proposal. option #2 is definitely the best.dmc"
10/17/2015,"i think you mean ""get people to stay.""i played a long time ago, took time off, came back, and now i'm done for good.and this is why: there is nothing interesting to do that doesn't involve getting messed with by jerks.i've watched pirates camp market-hub stations with only two cruisers.this is, literally, the only game i can play for 50 hours in a week and make no meaningful advancement at all. and that's why eve is losing players, and that's why i've no cancelled my three accounts. for most players, it's a huge learning curve leading to a miserable experience.o7goodbye."
10/17/2015,"time for another mass-protest, after incarna greed is good debalce, ccp games still has not learned the lesson source:"
10/17/2015,i fail to see why a proposed idea is reason to start pitchforking and acting like spoiled babbies.
10/18/2015,"ccp just needs to admit that the recent changes are a failure, just like the incarna expansion was. i mean give us a reason to log on this winter. roll back the phoebe jump changes, bring back dominion sov, let us slug it out all winter while they figure out something better, but please let's stop the lunacy of the current mechanics. dominion sov wasn't perfect and yes it was ridiculous that a fleet could travel from one end of eve to the other in minutes, but it was fun . . . not tedious, boring, mind-numbing work."
10/18/2015,"uhm, no it wasn't fun and yes it was ""tedious, boring, mind-numbing work""."
10/18/2015,"it's like ccp arbitrarily giving one nullsec corp double bounties, and double income from moon mining. if one faction has twice as much isk as everyone else they can afford the better ships, and they will get more members etc and everyone else in the game would be up in arms. might not be deliberate policy, but the reslut is the same. caldari at a big disadvantage because of the lp store, something entirely out of their control."
10/18/2015,"while the analysis is globally correct, you forgot to include a few fact: gal/cal is twice the population of min/amarr. been that way for what? 3-4 years? caldari has been t1-zoned for what? 1.3 year at least. and no, the occasional t2 was not that frequent, which explain the crappy lp values. sadly, minmatar ships are a pile of crap, because autocannons have low dps compared to blasters, and worse damage application than pulse and close range missiles. also, artillery are way to hard to fit with a decent combat fit. the problem is most likely no the ships by themselves, but because of the weapon system they use. also, vni is indeed op. versatile, can be tanked (as the vexor) with active shield/armor, passive shield/armor/hull fits. and best of all, the fact that it can deal bs-lvl dps. which is the reason why it's used as a farming ship in null, and also the fact that it is included in lots of doctrine as both a damage dealing and anti-support cruiser.you may ask, why not just fix it by downgrading the dps capabilities? well, by doing so, you'd end up with a... vexor. it is actually not possible to balance the vni, because it would mean making a vexor, or a totally different ship. which is also not going to happen.(also, on a side note: day four of the csm contained things about fw missions going to be rebalanced, which means it will become easy to farm crapload of gallente fw lps. behold, ""vnis everywhere"" is coming!)are you speaking about goons regions, before the moon rebalance? also, mordus angel, or soe stations (not sure which ones) in goon space have preferential lp stores. while they don't earn twice the lps, they still do pay twice less."
10/18/2015,"no because that isn't arbitrary, goons can fight for high value moons/more valuable null space... in fw we have absolutely no control over the crap ccp put in our lp stores. its more like ccp giving goons a global +100% buff to all income.also lp prices go up the lower the tier your in, which is kind of the whole point of this thread! so if you were right that caldari have been stuck in t1 while gallente are in t3 which isn't true then caldari lp should be worth several times as much as gallente but the opposite is true. the fact you have consistently been flooding your market with far more lp than us and getting higher lp prices means the lp store is not balanced - it's completely busted.but you make a good point on the size of the warzones, twice as many pilots should mean twice as much sales so the problem is not that gallente should be getting less but rather that caldari should be getting more. if you really wanted content, if you really wanted an enemy that could afford to fight back you would put your role playing to one side for a moment and support this."
10/18/2015,"hello friends,i hereby announce my candidacy for csm xi! last year i ran for csm x - i didn't make. i did however end up 22nd out of the 76 candidates, which was an amazing accomplishment. this has only encouraged me further as i know that i can make great contributions to the csm, and that is why i'm running again for csm xi.who am i?my in-game name is bobmon. i have been the ceo of evenews24.com for 2 years now.i started playing eve online in 2010 following an introduction by a couple of my friends who had their own dutch corporation. this corporation was part of an alliance that had an active war going on at the time i joined. i was a brand new player and back then you couldn't really get involved with pvp so i decided to make a new alt, fly over to the location of our enemy, and see what they were up to. after a bit of chatting, i got to know them and they asked me to join. i then began relaying intel to my friends, and so i'm very proud to say that my first task in eve online was to be a spy!from those humble beginnings, i have progressed in my eve career and experienced many aspects of gameplay including:all of these aspects have taught me a lot about the game and the players who play it and i think that they will help me a lot as a potential csm member. focusi think the most important job of a csm member is to be a bridge between ccp and players. players are the ones playing, and can help ccp discover problems with eve online that need to be solved. eve online is in a state where a lot of new features are being released and so it's exciting to see what the future holds for us, the players. my focus will be:these are not points i will purely focus on, i will deal with whatever is necessary. however, i do think that the above points are very important for the future of eve online.do you have any points that you find important? please contact me! (details will be at the bottom)why do i want to join the csm?over my years of being active in the eve online community, i've come to the conclusion many times that i'm deeply in love with our community. this is a key reason to why i've always kept playing eve online and it has often put me in a position where i had to explain to my rl friends why i'm so passionate about the game!while being active, i've also been in a ton of game related discussions and through my work at en24, i've been in contact with a lot of different types of players, from the best fcs to the pilot who can barely fly his retriever in highsec. i<U+FFFD>ve spoken with those players a lot, and i<U+FFFD>ve learned about their ideas or concerns.this is my ultimate drive to be a csm member! i feel that sometimes changes are made to affect bigger groups of players to the detriment of the lone members. i would like to represent those individual players and make the game more beautiful for them and everybody!ways to get to know me better?1) feel free to ask me questions in this forum thread2) check out my twitter3) check out my past articles4) check out bob's corner where i talk about stuff that interests me5) feel free to mail me at: bobmon.eve@gmail.com if you want to talk6) watch my fanfest presentation7) watch me on the meta show"

10/18/2015,bobmon for president!huzzah :d
10/18/2015,this is what i said last time and nothing has changed. i believe that bobmon will be bringing some fresh air to the csm. he will also be able to improve the overall communication abilities of the csm.will vote for bobmon.
10/18/2015,"good dedicated guy with the knowledge needed, would vote for!"
10/18/2015,"to add a little detail on that 22nd:it's more complicated than that. there are people who ended up 'closer', that bobmon would get in in front of, if other people were to leave the csm.for example, xenuria came in something like 18th, but requires many more people to drop out, before he stands a chance to get in. this is because he doesn't have many votes cascading down to him, from other candidates. bobmon had better support that way.this isn't an endorsement of anyone. just a little clarification on the process."
10/18/2015,thanks for the clarification!
10/18/2015,"i'll be voting for bobmon with all my accounts, you should too. :)he's passionate about the game and he'll put in tons of underappreciated unpaid work for the community and ccp."
10/18/2015,bobmon is a good man in and out of game you have my vote
10/18/2015,voting all accounts for bobmon. a good man
10/18/2015,"i dog0fwarr, personally endorse bobmon's csm 11 candidacy. he's a man of the highest moral caliber and can quite easily tie a cherry stem in a knot using only his tongue."
10/18/2015,"i've worked with bobmon for years and although unnecessary, i can vouch for his ethical standards as well as to say that he really puts in hard work and takes seriously what he does."
10/18/2015,"bobmon is an incredibly cool dude; awesome at all the events i've met him at and actually wants to make a difference, unlike 90% of csm who just want the title.for sure he'll be someone who'll put in the work.+1 on all my accounts"
10/18/2015,vouch has my vote.
10/18/2015,bobmon has a good eye for what the game should be in the future if you wanne make a difference vote for bobmon.good and solid person both in and out of game to.
10/18/2015,this boy is a good boy
10/18/2015,i whole heartedly support bob's candidacy for csm and wish him well. player to dev communication is the key.
10/18/2015,"i met bob for several years now, young, passionate and a lot of enthousiasm for the game we love. he was gutted when he didnt get in last year, but stv can be a ***** ;), i did 1,3 term:) and the second one got too me too quick, so i made way for soemone else, ratehr then too occupy someoen s seat.i wish it could have been bob, he has the energy to drive eve for us into the next decade, put him somewhere on your allot , you wont regret it, i know he will be high on mine, and hopefully alot of provi residents too."
10/18/2015,"good guy, that bobmon! met him in eve a few years back and a solid dude! also met him at fanfest when we were in the same corp and all i can say is he has an eye for the game both in and out of it."
10/18/2015,who can say no to this face.
10/18/2015,i support bobmon for csm
10/18/2015,bobmon is cool and i keep disappointing him!!!
10/18/2015,thx cearain :)i've noted both down and will work on doing a proposal for atleast the timer rollback.i'd love to have a chat with you after my vacation so we maybe can crunch some numbers or discuss other things.thx mixu :)joffy aulx-gao

10/19/2015,thanks for reading joffy. i would be happy to talk about any of the faction war mechanics. in the meantime have a great vacation. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
10/20/2015,"counter-point:i have heard many, many, many people express their approval of the new sov mechanics. not everyone thinks it is bad.remember, we mostly only hear from the upset people in this game."

10/20/2015,"well, no **** sherlock. i was unclear as to whether or not this was a community-editable wiki. and where did i say that i wasn't willing to take part in it? quite the assumption there asshat.my second point is that a community-editable wiki with no oversight is bound to get filled with troll entries. if it's ccp's, then they should do something to try to ensure its accuracy, otherwise it is unreliable. i could troll-edit the whole damn thing and nobody would notice."
10/20/2015,"then go do that. the wiki is filled with outdated information, not malicious information. that's evidence that despite people being able to troll the wiki, they still don't.if it's a community updated wiki, it's up to the community to ensure it's updated. it wouldn't be the responsibility of the csm or ccp to do that."
10/20/2015,"well, i'm of the opinion that there should be something like this that is ccp's responsibility, as there is no manual for this game. there needs to be some info that is kept current, is accurate, and is not susceptible to trolling. anyway, as i push that idea, i'll see if i can't get some community effort behind the ill-conceived site that we have."

10/21/2015,"it's true that there needs to be a reason for new players to stay.i have seen fairly high retention rates of my own referrals, but mainly because a lot of them specifically join the game and train to sign up for wingspan corporations.if media personalities were to act as ads for eve, they would most likely need to helm corps to capitalize on their fame and retain players who want to fly with senpai.i have tried to convince some of my youtuber fans with decent followings to play eve, but have not been successful. they see it as a niche game they won't make money on with youtube/twitch monetization. i would like to be able to tell them they'll make money with the eve affiliates program but the program website is in shambles so good luck selling anyone on that."

10/22/2015,"dominion sov was not perfect and sov grinding sucked, agreed, but the fights made it worth it imo.being that ccp has changed the sov system multiple times over the course of the game, that's ridiculous to say it isn't going away. maybe it won't go away today or tomorrow, but eventually it will. the question is how soon will it go away. for all of the complaints regarding dominion sov, it was hugely successful. people have turned to the forums (myself included) because we enjoy the game, unsubbing or ""not logging on"" should be a last resort.true, <U+FFFD>upset people<U+FFFD> are most likely to fill out surveys or provide feedback (complain). while i am sure ""not everyone thinks it is bad"", judging by the threadnaught this has turned into, the dwindling subs/actives, etc. i would say not enough people think it is a good idea or find it an enjoyable way to play. o7deeebo"

10/26/2015,"so, for those who don't know, this happened during the assault on akidagi. dust514 mercs had an effect on the overall conquer percentage and managed to invul the ihub mid fight. now, i'm personally tickled pink that we dust mercs had an effect on the eve world that was totally tangible. however, /u/anurendark from reddit and others voiced some valid complaints about the system in general.they mentioned that such effects feel like ""rng"" due to the nature of how dust514 fw works. we can't decide on where we want to fight, we just get sent places. however, where we get sent depends on system activity, so we normally end up in that system if enough is going on. the big problem is that we can't control it. it's all a matter of whim.i have posted something similar to the dust514 cpm as well. from what i gathered in the reddit thread, everyone was happy that dust514 got involved with the fight, albeit in a rather frustrating way.i would like to ask the csm to work with ccp on making fw easier to co-ordinate with both sides. we want to be able to choose to attack or defend where the militia needs help. we want to work together with the militias to be able to systematically push our influence farther. to couple that, /u/spikeinlocal, a member of pfr, also had something to say on the matter. summed up, he wanted a tab or menu so that both sides could see dust514 district activity so that they knew where to go for bonuses or lp, opening up more room for content as both sides race to grab these benefits. in summary; for a game that is all about player content and freedom, we can't believe that such an important choice is left out of the players control. we want to be able to co-ordinate with capsuleers and fight with them. capsuleers also want to make finding and helping dust mercenaries easier as well. we want to help you guys out in space, all we need are the tools to do so. thanks for your time."

10/26/2015,nicesup?
10/27/2015,"yes, absolutely! we've actually been asking ccp for a mechanic to choose battle locations for players who pledge loyalty to a faction for years at this point.the old corp battle system that existed before planetary conquest was released actually listed every single faction warfare district and allowed the corporation creating the battle to choose from any of them. as soon as that was done that battle would show up to all directors of every other corporation, and they could jump on as the defender.the mechanics to allow location selection were actually in the game back when it was on singularity. they only need to bring them back such that we can work better with eve players to fight over systems.rattati senpai noticed us! see you in the next fps!"
10/27/2015,+1it would mean i don't have to jump around so much just to drop obs
10/27/2015,+1i don't do fw but this seems really obvious as a thing that should be.
10/27/2015,"there is actually a fairly simple fix to mitigate the ""rng"" issue which would avoid to make your 50 man fleet wait at the ihub because some random dust match changed the system vulnerability. (even if you have a dust team matches are still fairly random from eve perspective since a matchmaker is generating them, your team might not get picked for example)currently, dust influence changes the total vp needed to make the system vulnerable. the proposed fix would keep the total vp needed fixed, but change how much each plex contributes to the vp pool based on dust influence. once a system is vulnerable it would stay vulnerable until someone flips it or deplexes - no surprises at the ihub. the overall dust influence would be still identical to the current implementation and would influence how fast you can flip a system, just like it does now."
10/27/2015,"i would like to see more tangible links between eve and dust... i am not quite sure how but growing dust 514's player base may be a good start.more players=more content and i do not think ccp have done a great service to dust in this regard. i love when the dust modifier is in my favor but i would like to see maybe a little recap of battles that happened to give me that modifier. something more than a notification and a little number in the upper left hand part of my screen.again i don't have the fix(es) but i know ccp is smart, and good at creating good games, they can think of something."
10/27/2015,dust side at least got a response.hopefully we can see some progress towards this in the future!
10/27/2015,been wanting this for years.
10/27/2015,"the beacon in space for a district should become visible when a battle is taking place, not only when someone warps there."
10/27/2015,"according to multiple sources within cpm 1, including soraya xel who said as much publicly, eve devs pretty much don't care about dust integration. some of this is due to perceived personal bias, some of this is because for a long time doing anything to support dust was considered ""lost development time"" as they figured the game was dying (spoiler: it's not going anywhere). and some of it, i imagine, is simply because they don't know if there's any legitimate interest coming from the majority of eve players/csm.i hope there is enough pull to show them the error of their ways on this particular topic."

10/27/2015,"as an industrial candidate you're going to get a lot of loud voices in your corner that essentially want to make mining ""safer"" for them. how do you balance gaining the support of the people you want to represent vs avoiding the trap of wanting to make eve too safe? or do you feel that the ""safety first"" industrialists are a mostly small but vocal minority you can afford to ignore?"
10/27/2015,"like everything in eve, there should always be risks. what i'd like to see if more options for industrial ships for instance because of how vulnerable they are with not really being able to have real way to fight back.so one of my thoughts is this: taking the skif/procurer for instance. the ships that is made to withstand damage and take a beating, have an extra high slot to be able to fit something that would allow it to 'fight back' in a sense. you would not be able to fit another mining laser on this slot. it wouldn't be something that would be on the ship, so you would have to choose basically make the choose between that extra high slot, or use another mining ship for more yield/ore hold. so in this example; you can basically fit a cap drainer for instance.so i don't feel that this would be something that would made eve make 'safer' in the sense you're referring to (taking out risks involved); in my example; it's more to give more options. i bring up mining ships in this example because well; they are easy targets. i think it is finding that right balance, but i don't think that it should be no risks involved. risks is one of the things that make eve what it is.so... adding more options is what i would like to see. hope that answers your question"

10/27/2015,"i was asked, <U+FFFD>what is something that could benefit newer players coming to the game?<U+FFFD>some are salivating at the prospect of new noobsandwiches hitting space to prey upon for a new corpse in the corpse locker. though i think, like many, we would prefer for a good fight out there in space. growing player base numbers=more out there to spar with and stronger game economies. there is a need for the retention of new players. it starts with not bringing the bar to the new player, but bringing new players to the eve online excellence bar. the biggest complaint i have ran into regarding this is the learning curve. for a fresh player that has never seen the game they hit the ship, make a toon, and start being thrown through out space. the as they fly they experience multiple pop ups and notifications as they attempt their first flight. i understand we have a current system but i think it could be updated a bit to be a little more fresh pilot friendly. not only would this address new player to game, but to corps, provides an information source and training source for all areas of space.my thoughts are a flight simulator in station. you<U+FFFD>re already able to walk around as a character (which would be awesome if you could have player stations and ships with space bar/pubs/lounges<U+FFFD> i digress and get back to the point) the game is based on advanced technology so why not use it. tutorial systems that go through step performance in flying, mining, and game dynamics. have it searchable and drop downed in a friendly format that newer pilots can adhere to. it could be built upon the current information provided out there and would be using much of what is already in place. taking that current information and putting in a simple and direct delivery system. quick simulator tutorial as it end the snap back to the listing and can read more in depth. simulator also allows for the ability to demo ship systems and target training for people trying to figure out what they want to train for. the looming questions for many new players are<U+FFFD>what style of ship should i fly?what professions are out there?will it fit my play style?what happens if i devote all this time into one and find out i don<U+FFFD>t like it?what is a cap chain?how do i<U+FFFD>(insert the many possibilities)?simulator also opens the door for training benefits and educating players and pilots in all areas. veteran corps and players could use it to train pilots. one the challenges each corp faces is taking in a corp member and getting them to mesh as a good combat pilot. some pilots that have been here for a while might want a new avenue to train towards. the ability to jump in and try a couple logi mission to see if it is a good fit... golden.this just my 2 isk worth and one idea i would throw on the table of possibilities i would love to discuss with both ccp and open forum of pilots.thanks x"

10/28/2015,"i talked with rattati today in the skype chat. apparently they are both discussing changes to fw. not sure what changes, but he definitely looked at the thread when i asked him too. i hope they consider these changes. as for the underlined, that is the point of these threads. if eve and dust want a better link, we need to let them know about it."
10/28/2015,"i am not sure if you want me to compare my experience with members of csm x even if they may or may not run next year, or only with the ones that are currently campaigning for csm xithis said, i started playing the game in 2009 and outside of a six months long lull i have played regularly, with one account first, then three when i chose to live solo in a wh, and now with five accounts.i once have been part of large alliances, and lived in null sec for around 2 years, then left the sov holding coalitions when b0tlrd accords were signed. i also lived for around two years in wormholes, mostly solo living off sleeper sites, hunting in null sec and wh space and performing pi. i have built my first capital myself, participated to multiple fleets, small and large, and have contributed to faction warfare in low sec. i have been mostly flying subcaps so far, and these days i like traveling light and pvping all across new eden. nearly half of my playing time has been spent as a mostly solo player.this is overall my in-game experience.out of game, i used to be an it project manager, and now own and manage my own business. eve online is my main hobby. i could be building and flying rc models, but i chose to fly internet spaceships in an exciting and challenging virtual science fiction universe."
10/28/2015,"well i think drones already fulfill that role. mining ships aren't suppose to be able to really fight back to any serious degree...or else they'd just be combat ships. a few of the mining ships can also become extremely tanky and can be fit to even solo frigates and destroyers. in fact since some mining ships are as tanky as they are, you generally need to attack with several ships before the enemy forms up a reactionary fleet and kills you.right now you haven't really given a fulfilling answer. ~something~ should be done according to you but you aren't giving me any sort of scale. should mining ships be able to fight off a pirate cruiser? if not a turret, then should it be a missile system? what would you see as fair?"
10/28/2015,"no, they shouldn't be able to fight off a pirate cruiser, unless some reason the pilot flying it just fails maybe 'fight back' isn't the right term to use here. maybe a counter would be the better term (can't find the right term i'm looking for) - anyways, that extra slot would not be a turret, launcher or anything like that, it'd just be a generic high slot to use. it also would not be used on all the mining ships; i think that would be too much there, it's why i only mentioned skiff's and procurer's."
10/28/2015,a counter like a cyno or...?also as an avid blueprint collector i noticed you are missing a triage bpo. i happen to have a highly researched one. blink twice if you can be bribed.
10/28/2015,i can always be bribed when it comes to a bpo that i'm missing ... >.> -stares at blue paper-
10/28/2015,"as for a cyno counter? erm, i didn't really consider a cyno, i was looking at other modules that could be put there. like a normal cloak, cap neut, a drone augmenter, and so on. there's a lot of options what that slot can be used for.and yea as i said before about the bpo, i can always be bribed ~_^"
10/28/2015,"as of right now, i can only reply to this in one way: ""if there is a cfc party line, i don't know it.""all of the ideas that i have both published in this thread, as well as those which i publish in my weekly column, are my own. the short version is that i believe that sov warfare should be asymmetric and engaging, with most of the options coming purely from player agency rather than a predefined ""you must do x y and z to contest this system."" the same theme of player agency stems into my other beliefs, which are primarily that the upcoming structure and capital changes should give individual players a lower barrier towards group action. as of right now it is very difficult for small groups to create an organization worth a damn, and a greater suite of in-game tools offered by the new structures, as well as applying some of what is available at the corp level to the alliance level, would allow for much easier collective organization by those who can't afford out of game websites, teamspeak servers, etc. if you want to know more, you should consider reading some of my weekly tmc columns, which are linked in my op."
10/28/2015,"fair answer. can you expand upon what you mean by ""asymmetric"" and ""engaging?"""
10/28/2015,"to expound upon it a bit: imagine a game of capture the flag in halo 3. (i pull an example from my own youth simply due to nostalgia, this can be applied to so many other games obviously.)in a game of capture the flag, you can play on a couple dozen or so different maps, each with different terrain. some are asymmetric, some symmetric in terms of their physical terrain. the asymmetric ones tend to favor the defender, giving more defensive tools to the defensive side and more offensive tools to the offensive side. the symmetric ones offer equal quantities to both. but that's just the terrain of the map, currently we can't even begin to get into that as the closest we have to ""terrain"" are fundamental things like wh effects and constellation layout, so let's address that later.there is another layer of asymmetry vs symmetry which is much more prevalent: the number of options you have for how to capture that flag and return it to your base. in halo, if i want to capture the flag from the other team, i have a huge number of options. i can opt to run and gun my way in, in which case i will run into a greater number of defenders and die. i can group up with a bunch of others and turn it into a bloodbath halfway down the map. i can sneak in the side door and make a break for it. i can grab a powerful weapon like a rocket launcher and blow apart a group standing in my way. i can take a land or air vehicle, laying down cover fire or using it to quickly get in and out. on the most fundamental of levels, eve's terrain is inflexible and there are limited numbers of options. but on a broader scale, with the number of ways to catch that flag, you have only one: you entosis the node until it goes into ref, and then you contest the node in warfare throughout the constellation. the fights change, of course, but not by much considering that there are a few select ""optimal"" ways to do this that people who are better at military tactics than i am can explain. this means that sov warfare is fundamentally not particularly asymmetric as you are only afforded a limited number of options for core gameplay. sure, on the more surface scale of fleets and fleet fights you have a broader scale, but there is a limit to the number of options available at the core. no physical mechanics that i can use to undermine the defender's adms or weaken their infrastructure beyond ""force them to stop ratting and blow up their ihubs."" nothing i can do to screw with the attackers. it's this asymmetry and the sheer number of different ways that you can capture the flag in halo that makes it so much damn fun. while fozziesov is an improvement, it lacks that true variety that makes no two ctf matches in halo be exactly the same. so, what i'm saying is that less symmetry and more opportunities for play vs counterplay would make eve's sov warfare much more engaging. ****, even something as simple as ""you can entosis the sov structures to capture them or shoot them with dps to destroy them,"" something i recommended in this column would make it more interesting just because it creates more options for attackers and defenders. hope that helps."
10/28/2015,"to go along with that, it would be nice to have a possibility to actually raid the enemy for their things. perhaps any minerals you mine have to go through a deployable structure before getting to your in station hanger.do you believe the csm is a passive reactionary group for ccp to bounce ideas off of, an active initiative taking group that is there to suggest ideas based on their player experience? maybe a little bit of both? how do you view your role?"
10/28/2015,"it would be an interesting idea, yes. there's a lot to be said for stuff like that: nullarbor talked a lot about asset safety at eve vegas and we had a lot of conversations at the round table about the appropriate amounts of asset safety with new structures. i would have to say that it should be the latter. passive reactionary groups are not hard to come by - that's what we have things like public critique of devblogs and sisi for. in my honest opinion, the csm should be a proactive group of different people from different backgrounds who have proven that they can both propose innovative ideas for the future of the game and directly critique ccp's ideas before they even hit the devblog stage, and do so in a way that actually encourages us to be trusted as qualified individuals with a vested interest in the game rather than promoting the interests of a specific alliance. these reasons are why i stay explicitly neutral when i write my columns - it would be very easy to write or spin them in a way that only proposes ideas that benefit my alliance. but that's not what i'm about - i'm about creating changes that are good for the game as a whole, not solely good for one group of people."
10/28/2015,really good answers. i've done this sort of critique thing for a few years now and this is one of the better ones. most people give such half assed answers.who do you agree/disagree with on the current csm?
10/28/2015,"i appreciate the positive feedback :) i've put a lot of thought into my answers and am determined to be critiqued based on my ideas, not the fact that i am a ""cfc candidate."" as far as the csm agreement/disagreement, i could write a lot about that, but it's currently 4 am in my tz. i shall leave this comment here for now and edit with an update expressing my opinion after a good night's sleep."
10/29/2015,there are just so many good ideasi am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
10/29/2015,low skill point base for new players a major hurdle. (i know. old dead horse here.) maybe an injection of more skill points over a period of say 5 months? an injection of 2 mil skill points each month for 5 months under the condition the account is continuously subbed by traditional billing methods and not plex (to cut down on alt farms). this would allow both income for ccp and an incentive for new players to give eve a real try.tv advertisement would be a good way to generate more players. i do not recall ever seeing an eve commercial on tv here in the us.
10/29/2015,"oh, rattati has been all for it.unfortunately it's the eve devs you gota win over :/"
10/29/2015,hence why this thread was made. ccp listens to the csm more than the dust department.
10/29/2015,i believe the depletion of moon resources would not be such a bad idea for the reasons mentioned. the rotation of moon resources around various planets would do 2 things i think.1. generate more conflict2. possibly shift control of rare resources the smaller corps/allianceswhat i do not get is why everyone is scared of such a rise in prices (i do not moon mine so would only effect me as a consumer)? it would make it similar to pi where you have to move the extractor heads around as resources deplete on a planet except on a regional scale rather than a planetary scale. i do not see where the problem with the cost of moon goo going up which would increase the cost of t2 ships (which i fly a lot of). there are so many ways to make isk in the game and lots of it why not have a way to spend it too?
10/29/2015,i've flown with joffy a couple times when i used to live out in placid. great guy who actually dropped what he was doing to come help a couple of my pilots with some trouble we were having. definitely got my vote mate.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
10/29/2015,oh awesome nashh is running for csm :dthere's very few people as passionate or invested in the eve community as nashh is and i'd totally vote for him on the csm
10/30/2015,"a compelling case. i'll see if there is anything i can do, though i don't know much about faction warfare."
10/30/2015,"whyever not?in a previous thread in s&m, i enquired as to which lp store these might be obtained from, and was informed that these were removed from the game after an unknown length of stay. that would explain the collector's value of these things and the prices they command - in jita, they're going for about 200k/unit, which clearly puts them outside any sort of sane everyday use.why not bring them back? there are already faction variants of the other missiles (of all types), so why not these? was there some rationalisation for their previous removal?anyway, would like to hear your thoughts :)"
10/30/2015,"i'll be voting bobmon and i'll be explaining why he's the best choice to all my space friends.to put it briefly; he's got a pragmatic view of the game and from when i have spoken to him it's clear he tries to see things from all sides. but most importantly for the csm he is excessively active and incredibly committed.nice guy too, despite being pl"
10/30/2015,"bobmon will have my support,bob is a 'people person' and has easily what it takes to communicate player's feedback and ideas to the developer team. he's young and enthusiastic, but what he lacks in experience he makes up for in his energy, and his capacity to take guidance from others (i've experienced this first hand whilst he's been flying with me as part of #rekkingcrew). he definitely has a buzz for the game and it's community. i feel he would be a valuable addition to csm xi."
10/30/2015,"hello bebopi've talked with current csm member steve ronuken also known as fuzzysteve and he said that it'll ofc be a bit annoying but as long as i butt in it should go ok :) it's no different than a business conference and ppl do that over the world remotely.but no matter what we need to remember that the summits is just a part of being elected on the csm, it's about discussing changes, listening to player feedback and warning ccp if they do catastrophic things xd hopefully that doesn't happen. i'll also help motivate fellow csm'ers or devs if they feel down or sad. we all have those moments and we can just as well admit it.joffy aulx-gao"
10/31/2015,no there really isn't. you want to hang out in a not real pub with not real beer and get not real drunk.. your playing second life. not eve.
10/31/2015,yes there are. you want to hang out in a not real spaceship with not real weapons and make not real kills.. you are playing already a kind of second life.it's called eve.walking in stations is just one important part of making this game more versatile.
