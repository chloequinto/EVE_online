3/1/2009,"containers in containers with partitions? meh, just corp style hanger divisions, cans in hanger divisions like it is now, i fully expect to continue using cans even with this style of hangers just the ability to keep stored and current items separate without having a million cans everywhere is nice, and why not have a corp/personal deliveries split as well?-bpc-minerals / reprocess loot-deliveries-high/ ammo-med/low-bpo-storage (cans)-sellingpartitions are a bad idea (and i forgot where i read one of the staff explaining why not, something about coding)"
3/1/2009,"lv, i really like a lot of the things you've had to say and i respect your continuing effort to make eve a better place for all of us so i can't understand why you don't champion this.if you recognize that this is one of the highest supported topics of the player base (for three years running) then why don't you bring it up, first thing, every meeting?now i want to comment on the role of the csm. i hear a lot of things like ""the csm was not created for this purpose"". that doesn't sit right with me. sure, some issues, the csm should have extremely marginal roles such as exploit issues / banning issues / cheating / internal abuse of power / etc...but on this i believe the csm needs to forget why they were initially created and define themselves. in order for the csm to grow into an entity that truly can affect change, they need to realize that they have been granted power (even if it is only the most infinitesimal amount) and they should exercise it.now i am not suggesting radical action and grandiose proclamations of entitlement because ultimately ccp creates the game and they call the shots, but it must be recognized that we in fact are shareholders as well. we pay for this and without us, the game would not only be very boring but nonexistent. this is not one of those awkwardly worded threats by the way, it's simply a statement of pure fact.even though ccp ""created"" the csm, now we have it and i think it should be every csm's duty to continue defining itself and asserting the views of the player base.that being said, i think it is high time that ccp truly listened to the player base and made a ""sweeping"" change to the game that the players ask for. if at it's core the csm is focused on representing the player base than i can think of no better task charged to them than pushing ideas that we want pushed.by the same token, i don't think the majority of the people who really wnt this to happen want ccp to scrap everything and fix this, but i have to ask, why has there not been a devblog or any kind of response from ccp saying ""this is what we have now... and after that we're going to work on a pos overhaul.""hell i'd be happy with one dev that they stick in a closet with a candle etching ideas onto the walls with his fingernails if only to get the ball definitively rolling. i'd be happy with them sticking a janitor in there as long as something is happening with the issue. i have to echo what has been said before in that ""it's too hard"" is just not a good enough excuse from a company we all love (whom, i may add, has exceeded expectations in so many other ways).by the same token i believe that the csm cannot rest on it's laurels, nor can it abide pressure from anyone in representing the player base, including ccp. you represent us, and we want you to keep bringing up and pressing the issue any way you can."
3/1/2009,"well. let me try and explain further then.so say that you as a kid didn't really like the house. you went over to your dad and said that you would really like a new house. he says no, it's too expensive to move and points out that he just renovated the while thing.then you start bugging your mother about it, who gets really annoyed after a while.it's the exact same i'm afraid. the csm has to appear stubborn because it would ruin it. we can resort to reasoning, sure. but what you ask us to isn't reason. i'm sorry, i really am. but we already raised it. we were told it would not be viable. the issue is still in the system and was revised when we were in iceland, to the same conclusion."
3/1/2009,"i must respectfully say lv that this situation you describe is not accurate enough. sure it's close, but it doesn't quite encapsulate the situation.we are not children begging to dad, and i believe that i can speak for a few out there who are resentful of this view. i'm really not trying to pick a fight with those words, but i simply mean to say that i feel that us as players, and especially those in the csm, are much more than that.the fact of the matter is, we're adults and we pay rent in this imaginary house. we pay a subscription fee and seeing as how there will never be, nor should ever be an eve 2, ccp continually upgrades the existing platform. being that we pay rent and are not simply the impotent children that seems to be the popular viewpoint, i feel that we are validated.we are the living breathing eve. we make it what it is and ccp merely provides the tools for us to have fun.even beyond wanting this idea to come to fruition, i'm a little saddened by the fact that everyone seems ready to roll over on this. why is it ridiculous to demand a higher standard from a great company? why is it audacious for them, to at the very least, release a statement about this extremely important topic?i want the csm to fight for me on behalf of what i see as something a little more than a game. eve is some sort of insane socio/political experiment and in order to function properly we need the right tools. having something as cumbersome as the current pos mechanic, hinders our ability to enjoy this little world of ours.now i don't want to get all preachy and say that eve is life and simply rant about not having my way right away. what i do want however is to eliminate this seeming stigma that the player base has accrued on behalf of this issue.eve is an ever-changing world and thusly i believe that the answer does not lie in the pat answer ""wow is ------>""i want to change eve for the better, and effect the most change in the way that people basically interact with the game, instead of just ditching out. that's what i expect of my csm as well. so please, don't stop representing us in this matter."
3/1/2009,"i think the main problem is that missiles don't have a module to increase their ""tracking"" (exp velocity), as turret does (turrets have several, tracking computers, tracking enhances, remote tracking computers)missiles should have the same increasing either exp velocity or missile speed (depending on the script in them).i can't imagine why this isn't already in the game (as if the missiles wasn't prenerfed enough to begin with :p hehe)edit:typo"
3/1/2009,"ccp, you have done something really wrong somewhere.... i can only assume and hope it was just a mistake that is already being fixed...please we dont care if you change things for the better.. i still support the nano nurf but changing something for no reason is just wrong...."
3/1/2009,caldari ships arent even good for pve anymore
3/1/2009,explosion vel really ought to consider which direction the missile is approaching from and if it's hitting from the front half the speed mod really ought to be adding tothe damage not reducing it.we've had missiles that attack from the front since the late 60's you know.

3/1/2009,i like being flashy flashy however under the current system i can drop from 0 to -8 in a day of pvp.... however to get back up to 0 would take me about 3 weeks of 0.0 ratting... there needs to be an easier way for a pvper to gain sec... or make it harder to drop sec while in low sec (0.4 and below)
3/1/2009,"this is something that i do belive is very much needed at this point, as it stands at the moment ship scaling is very confusing at the moment with some ships, a very good example is the caldari frigate, the merlin. you can see a large window at the top of the ship that makes it look like a 1 man fighter but then if you take a look at a larger class of ship like a cruiser lets take the blackbird, the windows are a hell of alot smaller on it and looks like it can carry about a hundred or so yet the ships are pretty much the same size only the merlin is slightly smaller, this kind of thing is more emphesized when you look at the size of a carrier lets take the archon here, its maintenance bay can take around 3 battleships and if you look at the hyperion next to an archon then the battleship is over half its lengh and there is no way it could fit inside the carrier in any way. now im not saying make the capitals bigger to the point where it looks rediculusly oversized coming out of an undock tube but maybe make the other ships smaller keeping capitals as they are scaling everything battleship and smaller and making sure each class keeps to certain size, no bigger than x but also no smaller than y i know this isnt really fixing anything but i do belive it is something that has been way overdue"
3/1/2009,i'm so glad all of the other concerns and issues in eve are fixed so we can now worry about details like 'my megathron is too big'.
3/1/2009,im not saying its to big or to small im just saying the scaling isnt right
3/1/2009,"youre saying the windows on the merlin are too big...stop, drop, fix the merlins windows"
3/1/2009,the merlin was only used as an example
3/1/2009,"i agree completely, and this goes for a *lot* of ships too, another example is comparing the scale of a freighter to regular transports, or other ships. both visually, and statistically (looking at relative cargo capacity), the scaling isn't right. on many ships the windows are way out of scale in comparison to other ships, in other cases other components just dont look right when compared with other ships, etc. and yes i think its important, and i dont think it would be hard to fix, almost always ships could be scaled up or down to bring things into more believable proportion."
3/1/2009,"i trained for the nag thinking that in the insane amount of time it took to get speced for everything that ccp would of fixed it, but alas they still havn't (almost a year ago now) and i sold it to buy a phoenix which i'm currently training for."
3/1/2009,"simple and easy, make them warp back into the spot where they was before warp (so no matter how many times you log of you will end at that gate again.can't do anything more without having the huge possibillity of people dc'ing being f'ed"
3/1/2009,signed... needs to be fixed.. more so now that probes are changing so you will be nolonger able to quickly probe out someone who has logged off...
3/1/2009,"eh, not supported. i personally have issues with the client crashing randomly, thus making my ship vulnerable until i can get the client booted back up. this is just asking for trouble."
3/1/2009,"so this is a solution for gate camps in low sec???lets say i enter 0.4 and see a gate camp. i log off inmediately, and then..... wut happens???im really interested on avoiding griefers ruining my gaming experience."

3/1/2009,"mechanics change for high-sec then?if a player loots/salvages a player wreck in high sec, that he/she didn't kill him (or her) self or are not in corp/fleet with, should trigger concord action like any other aggression, that could effectively reduce the high-sec suicide ganking problem, as the suicide pilot will have to wait for concord aggression timer to cool down before being able to return to the wreck, which allows the victims corp to come in and maybe salvage the remains before that happens."
3/1/2009,hey good idea
3/1/2009,"1. war-decs should be more expensive, 50-100 mill per week seems more reasonable. as a minor deterrent the war-deccing corp should be saddled with the weekly expense for an additional 2 weeks if they retract their war-dec without having their target surrender.the problem seems to be that griefers can wardec at practically no cost, and start hunting players not used to low-sec conditions (primarily for easy kills, which imho does make the griefers look really pathetic).2. that you become a part of the war if you assist a warring party, at least the war-deccing party, is a good one too."
3/1/2009,"if you're not prepared to fight (or otherwise survive) a war, you're not ready to form a corp. stay in a larger, stronger corp until you have the resources, skills and experience to survive.the problem is not that wardecs are not expensive enough but that creating a corp is too easy and cheap."
3/1/2009,"if people want to pvp in wow they can go to battlegrounds... the people that quit as a result of being wardecced is a good thingif you dont want to be wardecced dont spam local with ""defenceless carebear corp consisting of 16yo's recruiting now"" or whatever it is that you do... people like you are soooo tastyyy!!!instead of leaving the game, why dont you join a massive alliance like intrepid crossing or something thats where you go these days to avoid wardecs and just hide behind the blob.a++ will reply again"

3/1/2009,"can't we have the ability to chose a corporate/alliance colour scheme on our ships, along with the corporate and alliance emblem painted on the ship itself. or would such diversities hurt the performance too much?i'm not thinking about a complete custom paint job, but more like predefined sections of the hull could have their colour (and perhaps a pattern from a limited selection of 'stencils') set by personal, corporate and/or alliance preferences."
3/1/2009,thought about this before but i imagine it would be -10 on the priority list
3/1/2009,"i agree, not exactly a 'vital' change :)but seeing how much players in other (inferior ;-) ) games put value on guild/gang/group signs and colours, it might not be a bad idea to consider this for a future update, however distant it may be."
3/1/2009,i'd support this as long as it doesn't cause a performance hit to the game - which i think the op was in agreement with given his question.
3/1/2009,"i had a thread on this matter - painting ships. you can view it here.unfortunately, the csm believes it will add to lag (which it won't - most lag occurs on the client rendering the ships, not the servers delivering the data). they shot it down, so now we're stuck with the same old bland ships."
3/1/2009,it's not like we want custom paint jobs like these:custom kestrelorcustom apocfound these in another thread in eve general chat :)
3/1/2009,i think you just killed your topic. thats the way how to smartbomb a good idea.
3/1/2009,"those pics offend my eyes i dont think preset colour schemes would effect performance that much, but being able to colour your ship might.corp and alliance badges on ships shouldn't effect performance that much either because ther not going to be huge and ther is already the preset parts for them, most alliance badges suck anyway apart from those that were created out of game like goonswarm's badge, now that is a badge that would look cool on a ship"
3/1/2009,"i did say that i wasn't looking at that level of customization. my thought were to be able to use colour highlights. along the same line as you see the differences between t1 and t2 versions of the same hulls, just a bit more...noticeable."
3/1/2009,"i'd be happy with base colors that can be changed. say 10 colors, and their variants.yes you'd have one or two wackos with bright pink hulls, but for the most part i think it would create a variety. and fleets in warp would look fantastic.even if you leave colors alone, we do need corp emblems.it's the little things in life you treasure."
3/1/2009,"not supported.pirates have it too easy as it is, so what if they can no longer gank anyone they want to at will?cry babies the lot of them."
3/1/2009,lololololol.
3/1/2009,"not supported - if someone doesn't want to fight, they should have a chance to get away. if the new lock times bother you that much - fit your ship accordinly to improve them."
3/1/2009,supported un-nerf nano
3/1/2009,"did you even read the thread?this has nothing to do with undoing the nano-nerf. he stated to fix the lock times, or the warp times.the nerf was the one of the better things to happen to this game."
3/1/2009,"not supported. locking times are fine as they are. when are we getting ""thumbs down"" option?"
3/1/2009,"bump. /signpropsosed solution: change the forumla for skill training time on sisi only.normally rank1 skill lvl 1 takes x time. lvl 2 takes x^n. lvl 3 takes x^n^n. etc...just change the value of n to 1. so lvl 1, lvl 2, lvl 3, lvl 4 and lvl 5 of a skill all take the same amount of time as lvl 1 does on tq.this would mean that you can do lvl 5 of a rank 10 skill in about 30 hours hours (6+6+6+6+6). you can do lvl 5 of a rank 1 skill in about 90 minutes. etc...this would mean that it would not signifigantly reduce ""annoyance"" skills that you need lvl 1 or lvl 2, but it would cut 5 days out of doing a ""prerequisit"" skill. it would cut (for example) 42 days out of training jump drive calibration 5."

3/1/2009,"the lag in jita is horrible, everyone knows that, and its getting worse as the games popularity increases. something must be done. there are several ways this issue can be mitigated. my suggestion is this:all stations within a 1 system radius of jita (the forge systems only), would be linked both in inventory, and in market related respects. in addition extra systems surrounding jita which would have links to them from multiple systems would aid getting traffic in and out.in addition having only one vector that ships leave stations on creates a perpetual traffic wreck of ships outside busy stations. (ships crashing into each other at station exit) in peak hours this can be so bad to prevent you from warping for up to a minute or even more!. fixing this is fortunately easy, simply add numerous exit vectors from stations and use them in a round-robin way, this ensures some spacing between ships allowing them time to get to warp."

3/1/2009,"faction battlecruisers are long overdue. more battlecruisers please. also, tech 2 tier 2 battlecruisers would be nice. more destroyers would be nice, but faction battlecruisers would be a fairly easy implimentation."
3/1/2009,"i still do not see what the ""named ships"" would actually do other then change slot layout or increase stats, arent rigs for this purpose? granted there are no rigs to change slot layout, but couldnt there be rather then named ships? the issues around named ship delivery ( faction drops? exploration bpc, lp store rewards?) seem to be a major fail, also what exactly would be different? - as to researching bpos to gain different levels of named ship creation , thats terrible, one more way to timesink research, one more way for large corps to distance themselves from newer corps, different slot layout would be nice, but isnt that also part of using different ships altogether? i think changing lp stores to give out named ships would be nice just who is the target market for these ships? and still again what exactly would they bring that was new?"
3/1/2009,"the op does not suggest slot changes at all. i really don't know why the discussion keeps finding it's way back to that point. all that he's suggested is named ships, much in the same way we have named modules at present.as for how these are acquired, researching the bpo is the only reasonable way it could be implemented. drops aren't a realistic option and there are faction ships in the lp store, but having the ability to research your bpo and make the ship your produce different/better than what the vanilla bpo produces. this would be beneficial to the research and manufacturing industry, and would provide for more variety in possible ship fittings, which for both pvp and pve would be a good thing.lolwut?so what you're basically saying is that there should be no benefit to industrial corps that deploy resources to research their bpos and organise themselves well?"
3/1/2009,you dont have to spend a long time in a 0.0 alliance before you realise 0.0 is at least just as flawed.
3/1/2009,"i like the ""clean"" rules of 0.0 to the mess of standings and war decs that exists in empire. by clean i mean anyone can attack anyone at anytime. if somone is not a known friend, they can be assumed to be hostile until such time as it's proven otherwise. pilot actions are dictated by the pilots, not limited by/dictated by game mechanics such as war decs or the sec status of the system. please note i didn't say alliances. i live in 0.0 and stay out of alliances. alliance rules get just as silly as concord rules much of the time."
3/1/2009,"i was told by ccp that its perfectly acceptable to jump corps multiple times to avoid a war, witch imho is stupid >_>"
3/1/2009,yeah it's not like people run away from countries when war hits...ccp knows a good portion of the player base does not want wardecs or combat... so they are not going to prevent them from enjoying a game (since it brings in money for ccp to stay in business )

3/1/2009,"other then the ""you want to macro mine hisec"" posters i havent seen a good reason not to have a monster lowsec capital mining ship, one that actually mines this time? i still cannot see why in the age of giant fighting ships there would not be a comprable giant mining ship (but the rorqual!) where is my roid eating ships? isnt that a slightly more efficent way to mine then lasering it bit by bit? get up close and personal with the actual rock? i dunno but matter transmission seems wasteful when you could just as well move to <1km and eat the roid where it sits, but thats neither here nor there, no sec simply does not have a mining ship built for it. not tank not mining ability not size, and we needs one,"
3/1/2009,"as it is with the hulk i cant actully get a full cycle of one of my strip miners without the asteroid dissapearing at the end of the cycle for most things so i think its fine but in all honesty it should have been made a lvl 4 exhumer requirement.but on a serius note with this post if you have something larger than a hulk it should probably be deployable and be pretty much static for the extra strips, more a mining platform with a range and yeild bonus and extra cargo space or even a special type of strip miner for the ship but if it was implemented some drawback to useing it though not to much to make it pointless should be impemented.im not to fussed either way but i do belive industrialists do need some loving to :-p"
3/1/2009,rofl at limit-to-lowsec suggestions.wtf? flying a good mining ship is against empire laws or something? will concord feel offended and blow you?
3/1/2009,"its a balance issue, mostly noobs vs established, having bigger solotype miners will let fewer and fewer individuals clear systems, new players wont be able to mine anything, as all the starting systems will be cleared out in a matter of hours, ristricting a huge mining ship to low or 0.0 will keep that from happening worse then it already is, and why should 0.0 miners face worse dangers in the same ships? shouldn't they be slightly more staggered to the inherent risks? the possibility of having a deep space miner on par with dreads or titans shouldnt be ruled out, im not saying they should tank or be that sized, but they should scale mining ships the same way they scale combat ships,"

3/2/2009,"hi guys well i can see that the csm has voted on the issue so i hope somthing will be done about this asap.im no programmer but i think that it should be fairly simple to impliment a 'script' or a modification that would fix this issue.as it is there is a lot of effort required to remove pos's that have been abandoned. for most players this is more a choir than fun. but raiding a pos and maybe even stealing it would be fun or at least funny and allso there would be no need of a huge gang of guys sitting at the offline/inactive pos that is basically a waste of space.to the nay-sayers i like to point out that if you fuel a pos 1 per month then you wouldnt be in danger of loosing the pos to some 'hacker?', pos owners just make shure the pos is online, if not, its just an exploit really (invaulnerable junk floating in space).there are a lot of nice ideas around here and ofc i have one as well---7 days after pos goes offline:the pos shields turn off (at downtime?), only armor and structure hp left.-if players want to kill it its much easyer now (no shield hp).-starbase structures can be approached and hacked (hacking skill or whatever), if successful their contents can be stolen.i would recomend having seperate hacking attepts for each 'hangar/division'(requires multiple hacking successes for each corp hangar etc.).---14 days after pos goes offline:-the all starbase structures can be hacked and if successful, unanchored and eventually scooped or redeployed.the starbase structures would haveto be re-anchored if the player wants the moon.additional stuff?if somone attepts to hack a starbase structure then a eve-mail is sent to the corp (maybe limit it to one per day?).maybe having a special unanchoring skilltree or maybe tying some science skills to the equasion so that it would be science (carebear) type of players that would be pos-raiding specialists.. make those r&d alts work for once"
3/2/2009,"i would love to be able to hack offline pos's, that said the chance of success should be really low.. likely you would end up spending hours sitting there trying to hack the tower. gives owners a chance at defending it if they havent really abandoned it but just let it offline cause they're short of cash or just trying to keep the location.. or whatever.. i could see this as a way to bait the prospective hackers in this situation if hacking someone elses property flags you. (does it? i havent seen it mentioned anywhere)"
3/2/2009,"yes, but cans also had hp reduced and were blown up by devs if they were used as place holders on moons. anchored pos are just exploiting the same system but with the added effect of more hp, and the potential to online them if an attack comes. only difference is the fuel saved during their offline state. when a tower runs out of fuel, it should start using it's stront while anchored as if in reinforced. if it also runs out of stront, then the tower loses it's anchored stated. people won't want to pay for stront, so they'll stop exploiting offline towers holding moons. add to that a 50% reduction in total hp and 0 resist while in anchored mode, and i think we got a winner."
3/2/2009,"well i agrea that it should take some time to hack. like i wrote in the last post, if you haveto hack each 'hangar-divisions' seperatly then you spend 1-2 minutes to hack each of them and if f.ex. a corp hangar arrey has 6 divisions its likely to take 6-12m for each array.second thing is flagging. well i personally think this should be treated the same way as when somone tryes to steal your can.. only in high-sec does it really make a diff.yaay..well considering the investment then i think it would be ok to let the owner keep the placeholder pos for a short time. my suggestion is based on the pos loosing all shield hp (no fuel = no energy) and only armor+structure being left.amarr pos shield 40m hp (0/0/0/0)armor 10m hp (0/0/0/0)structure ? (99/99/99/99)no shields => -80% online hp.. it would take 10 bs >30minutes? to kill it! takes 2 hours to unanchor a large pos anyway.the risk is always there if the corp lets it go offline that somone would attack it and pop it.. i guess its a bit easyer to pop a pos with no shield hp.devs... plz listen to csm and impliment some new form of sov mechanism, 0.0 needs help. using planets to hold sov would be brilliant.. colonys would be even more so!!"
3/2/2009,"it is completely different. it would be done with the community knowing and knowing why. from a role playing perspective, chribba has done a lot for the community and there is no reason why from a rp standpoint you could not believe his character acts the same way in game. therefor, especially with their new leader, the amarr letting chribba move his titan into amarr may not be that unbelievable. so they make him remove his ddd and the titan is harmless.i will not comment on the capital afk-mining in empire thing because it does not deserve a response.when an alliance wins the alliance tournament they receive a monument in a solar system of their choice. chribba's actions imho have earned him a reward from the armarr empire. its not favoritism when you put a logical reason behind it. if chribba was some random guy who had not done anything but be buddy buddy with a dev then yes, it would be favoritisim. anyways, enough ranting from me.i vote yes, chribba has done enough in my view to earn this reward from the empire."
3/2/2009,"i support this. however my only question is, how would you keep it safe? would you just be constantly flying it? or would you somehow haxxor the system to deploy a pos? considering that titans can't dock. just curious. --isaac"

3/2/2009,it would seem ccp is to high on their horse to even allow players producing content for them to use. even though plenty of games do it and theres a game i can think of thats almost entirely made (well its being made) of player produced art/models with skins/textures and all the other stuff required when designing things.
3/2/2009,"respectfully lv, i must disagree. a better analogy would be:the csm acts more like the concierge at a hotel that ccp owns, it is thier duty to inform management (ccp) that certain paying guests are reporting a problem with the plumbing in thier rooms. according to reports everytime they enter their bathrooms they discover that the toilets have backed up and sewerage is floating in the toilets (pos).while they can flush them and clear the *turds*, thereby making the toilets usable, this is an unacceptable situation.spending money on the hotel resturant and the convention center (ambulation) while likly to attract attention and customers, is offset when every time one of those few paying guests with the toilet trouble (pos users) speaks to another potential guest and expresses thier disgust at the ongoing situation, it damages the hotels reputation.as others have stated, this problem has been going on for a long time. while i think everyone would love immediate changes to address the turds that are pos's i think most would settle for a commitment by ccp to repair the system within a reasonable time. ccp's avoidance of the issue, and that includes the lack of commitment to entertain a solution or consider, one shows a lack of customer respect.i am looking for a commitment from ccp to us the customer base that they will repair the pos system, that it will be similar to the ""dead horse pos system"" and that it will be implemented within 1 year.respectfully,tribe(all my mis-spellings belong to us - - )"

3/2/2009,if you ctrl q under cloak the aggressing party has 30 seconds to kill your ship. if they have a point on your ship it just disapears.
3/2/2009,"oh they fixed that? well that helps somewhat. but when camping a highsec-lowsec point that doesn't help much.i try to not jump into hostile camps. but i can't say i have disconnected right after gate jumping often. usually disconnect mid combat, and that really sucks, as they have 15 mins to find me, or even 15 mins to kill me as they have me pointed. i support that log off tactics need to be looked at."
3/2/2009,i think the real issue is the double logging that makes ships not return to their original location. and that should really be adressed.
3/2/2009,"if a neutral reps your target, instead of him being hostile for 15 min, he gets concorded.inb4 the whine."
3/2/2009,100% agreeand made a thread about this in c&p a while backthread in c&p
3/2/2009,totally agree. people will say well why not just shoot them? you enter a fight with what you hope is proper intel on your targets. but then when 3-4 neut reppers show up and you have to waste time killing them you have just lost valued time and dps while taking dps to shoot a target that should not be there in the first place.
3/2/2009,"your proposal goes against the ""sandbox"" idea that eve is supposed to be. if someone wants to become involved in a fight, they should be allowed to do so. no reason for police intervention, since the neutral hasn't broken any laws."

3/2/2009,"this, becuase currently it allows someone to engage in a fight and deagress w/o consequences. its considered agression when repping someone who does an action that brings concord, in the same it should be counted as agression to rep. same with in lowsec, rep someone who is gotten a gcc and you get shot by sentry guns but yet still allowed to dock/undock at ease.this is going to get even worse now that players wont have a 30sec timer on changing ships.but not some, illegal to interfere with your fight crap... this is eve, someone psses in your sandbox.... lol good luck"

3/2/2009,"i support the ceo insta-kick, also when a ceo insta's someone he should have a short list of choices: hostile, neutral or friendly. he picks one when he boots someone and it shows up in that players history next to the corp. the choice would default to neutral for those who just cba to let the world know if they like someone or not. the choice only shows for corps that a player gets insta'd from, so it encourages ppl to just drop roles and wait the 24h. i also think a ceo and corp security officers should be notified via eve mail when a player drops roles as that would make corp theft not quite as easy."

3/2/2009,"the ammount of people that are normaly in there is the problem most of the time and the server not being able to handle that amount of people, rather than a persons connection.also if the frame rate is low on his pc, then its more than likely that.jita does lag still, but they have fixed it so it isnt as bad, but i do think that linking the markets together in that area would make it so people are more spread out, then again if they did that then people will just go to the system at the edge of that area, moving the them there and the problems it causes."
3/2/2009,"i can't stand jita - and so i very rarely go there. an idea: due to the cost of the faction wars, the caldari state needs more funds. the caldari see an opportunity due to the thriving market in jita and they add a war-tax to all market transactions that take place in the jita system. potential result: hopefully this would push more trading and market activities out of jita - increasing markets in other systems."
3/2/2009,won't accomplish anything.taxes are a poor excuse of a solution.just stop going to jita.i can get pretty much anything i need if i look hard enough.
3/2/2009,"if (and i repeat if) this is actually causing lag on the server side (as opposed to client lag), then the solution is fairly simple:either 1) expand hardware to meet demand, or2) reduce the concurrent user per star system count.if, on the other hand, it is a client issue, there really isn't much ccp can do to help, and i'd hate to waste their resources trying."

3/2/2009,"when did i mention t2 ships? perhaps you misunderstood what i meant by t1 counterpart. i was referring, for example, to ships like the cyclone. this ship is flow disproportional less than the hurricane because it is generally outclassed by the latter.if the objective is to have more usable t1 ships, im suggesting that it is more efficient for ccp to fix existing but largely ignored ships than to create new ones. ccp wont have to make new models, textures, etc. all efforts can be focused on making new, useful and hopefully innovative roles for the existing hulls. moreover, ccp has a lot of information on existing hulls, and thats a good starting place to fix them (as opposed to starting from scratch).once ccp has made most existing ships reasonably useful, then they can focus attention on expanding the fleet of t1 hulls (or spend that time on something more useful). this will yield more results from ccps limited resources."
3/2/2009,"ahh, right. i misunderstood what you meant by ""t1 counterpart"".i agree that unused ships should be rebalanced so they fulfil a useful role - but in the case of destroyers, both rebalance and expansion of the line is needed imo."
3/2/2009,no worriesi probably would have misunderstood myself had i not already know what i myself meantif that makes any sense.

3/2/2009,"way too much stuff to quote and still have room to respond, so i'll just wing it.here is the chain of events that prompted my posting in this thread:#1 i read this thread#2 i read the csm minutesif you don't like how issler's input was presented in those minutes then you can ask to have them revised. i saw issler's name along with 0.0 issues and a red flag went up because i've seen her operate and unless something major has changed she's not my image of a 0.0 capable leader.this is how issler worded what happened. if she honestly feels that her suggestions were positive and helpful things that will improve eve instead of removing challenges then she can post them and i will read them. maybe they weren't so bad, but since they weren't detailed in the minutes i wasn't privy to that info.i've tried to explain this before but i'll do it one more time just for the heck of it. why did a red flag go up when i saw her name along with 0.0 issue discussions?#1 her leadership style, which she broke down in this thread, isn't so much a leadership style as it is a social event directorship. it's not conducive to survival in any hostile environment, although it's a great way to meet nice people.#2 avoidance of challenges - while the entire alliance lived in low sec, issler's people lived in high sec. rather than organizing low sec mining ops everybody sat around in high sec and mined. it's not so much that this is a bad practice but that it became a habit to avoid challenges. mining in high sec is fine, except that it dulls the survival skills needed to mine in tougher environments.#3 disorganization - maybe this is part of her core philosophy, who knows, but nothing seemed to be important enough for her to focus on it. tada o's ship building service was often plagued with delays due to nobody centrally managing it. orders got canceled all the time because jobs weren't getting built. during freighter ops she had this bad habit of warping to the wrong gate... and she was one of the freighter pilots. again it's just a simple case of organization and discipline. everybody makes mistakes, but some situations call for extra care, organization and attention.#4 lack of understanding of serious politics - yes this goes back to the payoff for the freighter move. some of this is coming back to me now that i'm thinking more about it. there was a crap ton of minerals for sale in either pvh8 or eza-fm when we moved into syndicate. i remember issler having logistics issues with getting her build supplies into the pc9 cluster where we lived. i'm pretty sure she purchased those minerals and then realized she couldn't just go get them solo with the freighter. i don't know the full story unfortunately, but i do know it was confirmed that she payed off one of our direct opponents to be allowed to move the freighter safely. it doesn't matter if it was huzzah or fire mandril or exm or whoever, it happened and was the final nail in the coffin that got tada-o kicked out of the alliance.so that's it, as best as i can explain it. i'm not saying issler is a bad person or that she shouldn't be a csm. i'm simply saying that seeing her name next to a discussion on 0.0 made me wonder what good she could possibly bring to that discussion. maybe she's changed, maybe she learned some lessons along the way, who knows."
3/2/2009,"we understand she's not your ideal representative. her leadership is moot unless you would like to apply to the corp. i assume that's why you voted for someone more in line with your views.i thought you didn't comment on things you didn't know about? your next post (had i not done it here for you already):and the rebuttal:niskin, we have heard your views. several times. we understand entirely that you don't know what issler said on the subject of 0.0, something you readily admit."
3/2/2009,"you are absolutely right! why didn't i see it before, internet space ships is very serious business."
3/2/2009,"niskin. mostly you still seem to have a grudge. let talk more about your views of leadership when you've started a corp of your own, had it survive over 3 years, started an alliance and then run for the csm. having done these things (or at least one of them) would add to your credibility. right now you just sort of complain about a vague feeling of unrest that you attribute to me and my participation in the csm.your recent posts also contain a variety of errors. for example, that we didn't partiticpate in low sec operations when bruce was there. since our primary office and where we paid out for minerals was aeschee which is low sec your statement is just wrong. we were active in every bruce mining op. also i live in low sec and hardly ever leave.your claim of canceled ship orders is partially true. bruces insistance on only engaging in combat when gigantic blobs could be formed and huge numeric advantages gained meant that we often could not get minerals to produce ships. thus the one time that i personally risked my own freighter to folks bruce would have called pirates to get bruce their ships. i should note in the end the ""pirates"" were more honorable than bruce.strange that these very insignficant events are still somehow the focus of a small group of bitter people. i think in the end what this is about is we moved on and are thriving. sorry about that. how we do that despite my horrible failures must just be impossible to understand. let me give you something to consider. if realty continues to be inconsistent with your theories, maybe your theories need some reconsideration.by the way, i am happy to report that my attempts to reverse engineer the nonni's lamb sub are advancing with great success! i am close to cracking the sauce!issler"
3/2/2009,"you run an alliance in which nobody is required to do anything, you are nice to everyone and you give them stuff to help them out. yes it's definitely an accomplishment of great merit that you've survived for 3 years! seriously, if your corp didn't survive 3 years i'd be amazed. failure cascades and corp breakups usually happen in the face of great challenges, not in the face of carebear bliss. i complain not because of what you've done but because you think what you've done is somehow special.the mineral cans were in attyn, that's where i was told to put the ore. in the entire time i was in tada-o i saw almost none of our corp members in aeschee. so while there may have been cans there, there weren't any people there to fill them. dantar420 and skiorh were regulars down there but they weren't miners either.memories are apparently short on your end of the gray matter, slow builds happened as far back as aeschee. myself and other people canceled our orders after waiting over a week on ships. bruce didn't blob until we got established in syndicate and grew quite a bit. at that point we had to because corps like exm weren't gonna give us a break just cuz we weren't as skilled as them yet. besides, if the orders were large due to blobbing losses why didn't you keep stuff stocked. you'd think that would be the kind of thing that an industrial corp would do.insignificant in your mind which is why you don't understand how people could be upset over them. failure to understand what's going on around you doesn't make it any less real. you make a choice, you take an action, something happens because of it. you brought these things on yourself even if you don't understand that you did."
3/2/2009,"i was inactive when the csm's were put in and voted on. after bruce fell apart i took a 6 month break and when i returned things were as they are now.being a csm puts a player in the public eye, by their own choice might i add. so it's not moot at all. how well a player understands certain portions of the game is relevant to how they fulfill their role as a csm. i'm sure plenty of people are worried about what darius's input would be on the csm and if they were they could do the same thing i am doing."
3/2/2009,"you sure are making a ruckus for someone who chose not to be part of the voting process. you know what they say, if you don't vote then you relenquish all rights to complain. do your civic duty next time. vote!edit: all this talk of supremely tasty sandwiches has made me hungry!"
3/2/2009,"yes, your eve history is quite fascinating. i greatly admire your attempt at changing the minds of eve one csm at a time. also, issler is not leading you. so it doesn't matter what you think of her leadership.she was not elected to remake eve in her image, but to lend her ideas and represent quite a few people in eve who voted for her. we understand you were not one of them, and don't need to hear why again.back to the point though, we're still waiting for the reply to the million dollar question:you have quoted the end of the post which contained this, but oddly enough, ignored the five or so ways this has been asked of you in the past.the best you have managed so far is:maybe you have an argument? maybe you will like her views? maybe she should violate nda's and repeat a ccp discussion just for you? maybe she doesn't care about winning your vote, should you choose to be subscribed to eve next election."
3/2/2009,"so now i should be held in scorn for being nice, providing freedom and creating ""carebear"" bliss for over 3 years. i think we just hit your nail on your head. i am happy and so are the folks in beep and we are enjoying ourselves in a manner that you don't like. ok, gotcha.... i'll get right on trying to reduce our enjoyment of eve....there were mineral cans there too. if members didn't want to operate in low sec i wasn't going to force them. sorry you missed the miners there. i didn't because i was both busy mining and paying the other miners there as well. we were very active there as there is where all our zydrine came from. you know a mineral you can'f find in high sec...sorry we offered you cheap ships and somehow you wanted them quicker. no one made you buy from us. i'll be sure to ask you next time i need to understand what an industrial corp does since you clearly are an industrial genius type.let's see, we left bruce and syndicate not long after the move there. another 4 months goes by, freed becomes famous for having one of the larger egos in eve, bruce moves to harder 0.0 grows larger, stabs some allies in the back, foom guts bruce and runs back to aeschee killing bruce in the process, and somehow in all that what i did in those early days is still keeps you awake at night. wow! i feel special!so niskin, when are we actually going to get an actual example of what i've done or said i was going to do in the csm to change eve that you have been asked for something like 20 times now? all i really have seen is that you now agree i have created 3 years of ""care bear bliss"" which i will use as an endorsement if i choose to run again.issler"
3/2/2009,"...? this comment has no valid point, your completly ignoring the actual situation and just stating a bland rebuttal. what does the old player have to lose from this? say you have 2 million sp invested in learning skills and ccp decides to get rid of learning skills:old players: will have all their learning sp removed and will earn sp at twice the speed until they have re-accumulated those 2 million sp. they could even make it 4x the speed or 10x the speed (does it really matter?). so basically what the old player gets out of this is a free 2 million sp (about 2 months training time).new players: can start training towards their specialization immediately without having to learn how to learn!! remember folks this is a game! its supposed to be fun, now of course anything fun is also usually a challenge, but training learning skills is no ""challenge""... its simply a delay of the fun factor of the games skill system which is training your character towards better modules, better fittings, and better ships. when my engineering 5 first completed i was really happy and proud of my choice to start training all my core skills as early as possible... when i finished training my last learning skill up 5 i wasn't happy or proud, i felt cheated out of my learning time to train something redundant, so i felt relieved that i got it over with.edit: oh and for the argument that they would have to give older characters the sp they would have had if all their learning skills had been level 5 from the start.... forget it! who cares! unlike you selfish bastards i actually care about new players experiences, and not just my own insignificant non-relevant gamer ego. scratch that i don't care about new players, i love blowing them up... but i want new players to enjoy their first month, because if they enjoy their first month then they will stick around! the more players in this game the better, because then the game will expand and not die out like most other games. i care about myself having fun, more players joining eve online and sticking around = more fun for me.so what will all your precious ""hard-earned"" learning skills mean if the game dies out because nobody wants to keep playing a game where you sit around and mine in your ibis and run level 1's in your merlin, just waiting to learn how to learn for the first 2 months of a game while you pay 15$ a month. and yes i know the alternative is to ""not train learning skills""... but the point is that you have to train them if you want to learn to fly anything in a reasonable timeframe."

3/3/2009,srry wrong thread
3/3/2009,give us new pos ccp!
3/3/2009,"hell, yeah!"
3/3/2009,signed awesome idea
3/3/2009,"*sighned.* the pos is my favorite part of eve. though currently it's implementation is lackluster at best. come ccp, we want this reworked"
3/3/2009,hi sec pos'essome corps/alliances have turned theres off because the bl**dy things dont work right. and haven't since the day pos'es where introduced into the game.and only left anchored in the hope ccp will fix them.
3/3/2009,i would love to see the explosion that ensues. you would hear the delightful sound from all over new eden
3/3/2009,"darth.. if you are not happy with your purchase you should get your money back! takef your pos to the nearest station (shouldnt be that hard in hi-sec) and place it back on market to get your isk backhaving moons populated with anchored offline poses, when some other players want to place pos's and use it, is a waste.if you want to use a pos then you should be required to keep it fueled.i think my suggestion is pretty balanced. if you would have a pos at a moon that nobody wants then you could probably go ahead and leave it offline, but it could get robbed/stolen, or it could get destroyed.maybe its like renting corp offices at stations and there were just one time fee fo9r them!there is a limited ammount of moons and there is a limited ammount of offices. if you dont pay for your office you loose it, thats not unfair is it? if it were so then a few players could rush to get all the offices and then sell them for a huge price.p.s. i hope.. pray.. that cccp will change sov. so that pos's/moons would no longer be a part of sov. mechanism."
3/3/2009,from 5%-->7.5% would be spot on. it might seem slight but in practise it's make or break for the gallente ewar line.a range buff would be welcome as well.
3/3/2009,:)
3/3/2009,"mate: reality check. this is a titan. he doesn't want it in amarr so he can make money off it. 60-70b worth of ship to make 5m/hr mining veld? he already has an ungankable ship he can do that in. he doesn't mine veld for isk. if he did, he'd have spent the money on the 60,000 hulks he could have bought for the same price."
3/3/2009,]this general discussion proposal is a the re-raising of the ore redistribution proposal that was discussed on the 5th csm2 meeting on dec. 20. it proposes a general discussion session with ccp on the topic of asteroid mining. the issue was passed without discussion.votes: 9:0 - escalatedsupported by: everyoneso the reraising of pos updating makes us look like children.?? but its ok to raise ore redistribution again and was supported by everyone!!!
3/3/2009,"no, you are getting it entirely wrong.first time bunyip raised it, it was voted down. this time it was voted for because of the fact the discussion was a request for us to discuss with ccp about mining.it's fundamentally different."
3/3/2009,"whatever, half the time i do not understand what is so bloody hard about saying to ccp to devote one damn dev blog on the pos issue - let them take their time, and address the issues in order of significance. lv, i do not even understand what the hell you said above, about a discussion about a discussion, your defense of indefensible behavior is actually funny at this point. the issue with the pos has been supported for over two, going on three years, by a huge number of players. the fact that it still exists and is actively resurrected is reason enough for ccp to begin to address it. granted, for the first year or so it has just been myself and a couple of others who have been waking the thread up, but, for the last year it has gained momentum like no other. what i have seen mostly from csm is pushing for individual agendas, but what else is new. i am sure eventually ccp will surprise the hell out of all of us and will actually say they have been working on redoing the pos for the last three years and have a final model... soon...."
3/3/2009,"so you are blinded by the strawman put up by the person who faultiy pointed out something he didn't know a thing about.let me make it extremely clear for you:1. bunyip raised an issue about mining/ores. the csm thought it was a bad idea and told him to come back when he had something better2. bunyip came back, still the csm couldn't agree with it. the csm did however agree that it was an issue which warranted discussion with ccp, thus the agreement to pass it."
3/3/2009,"what does this have to do with the price of cheese or the defective pos system we currently enjoy?throughout this thread the issue is constantly being direvrted. we do not care that mining was discussed, or that fitting tool will be revamped. thanks those are nice issues, now back to the pos system.. we would like ccp to comit to fix this, give it a place on the agenda relevant to the communities desire to see this fixed (relativly high) and set a time table / schedule to get it done.anything else is deflection, ... yes blasters need fixing, yes gallente need some lovin' , blah blah blah... ccp needs to quit deflecting and postponing this. treat us with the same respect we treat our customers / clients.thank you,tribe"
3/3/2009,"if you notice, people questioned an action done by the csm based on a strawman. if i let that incorrect perception become a truth by not pointing out the obvious fault in the reasoning, the csm is worse off."
3/3/2009,absolutely!
3/3/2009,"i reject your reality and substitute my own.correcting someone & staying on topic is possible, all that is needed is the realization that the topic at hand is more important than the reputation of the csm.getting the ""flogged to death pos system"" pushed into ccp's agenda and representing the players who placed you in the postion to represent them would demonstrate that the csm is not a waste but actually does benefit the community.now, how can you help me, and the other players that are pushing for a revamp of the pos system?tribe"
3/3/2009,"he cant, it has become painfully apparent that lv wants to please ccp more than he wants to help the players. unless, of course, the line in question coincides with his own. sorry lv, but i can't let you forget your own statement, about appearing to throw a tantrum. there are ways to push for an answer without appearing to be like a ""spoiled child"", as you put it. it takes tact, forethought, and some degree of grace. unfortunately, i think, some csm have indeed forgotten what they are there for, to serve the greater eve community, and not just ""some"" projects. to make sure the eve community is respected, and deeply needed changes brought to the attention of the ccp. it is ok if ccp says no, it is not ok if ccp just brushes csm off. it is ok if ccp says no, and gives thorough explanation, and not just ""too hard"" and ""too much work."" so, i just hope that eve players realize that and will push other csms to respectfully request a thorough dev blog on the current pos issue, aka ""bunch of junk strewn in space"" aka ""the dead horse"" aka ""dead horse: redux.""the more vocal the community, the sooner ccp will realize that this issue will not just go away, hey it has been around for a while... 2 years + and going strong, and the more csm might actually realize how badly we need the pos revamp. until then, keep on flogging."
3/3/2009,"this thread deserves to stay on page one. i wanted to train the nag but in its current state it is not worth putting more training time for an inferior ship. the least it deserves is a large boost to cpu so it can fit a shield tank and damage mods without needing a fitting mod, which no other dread needs."
3/3/2009,the upcoming tribune article should be required reading for anyone who has any influence to bring to bear on the log off abuse issue.
3/3/2009,"while ill agree with you on this,i'm still of the opinion that if a neutral party remote reps or remote sensor boosts someone involved in a concord sanctioned war, its giving the enemy an unfair advantage and thus should have their ship removed.its cheating and some corps have made their rep using this lame ass tatic."

3/3/2009,yeah lets move it to amarr
3/3/2009,so to entertain this jackass.... that and my corp needed to purchase an orca for cheaper than our local markets.... i went to jita.hasn't really changed since i last visited.... my only complaint is its damn crowded... other than that.... lag was minimal... yes its there... but not nearly as bad as it was the last time i visited jita...which was about oh...4 months back...maybe more.there where about 6 to 700 people in it at the time.ton's of freighters... plus mine : o )again... don't go to jita unless you need too... there are plenty of markets around.
3/3/2009,"jita is fine as it is it might not be the cheapest but you can get almost everything in one spot.also jita lag is minimal when you compare it to the old days when its was almost unbearable, currently the market works perfectly lag outside the station for me still exists but i couldn't be bothered less about that since i'm gone out of the system in 2 minutes."
3/3/2009,"good on ya mate for pointing this out to ccp, no-one should feel discriminated against in a game for what they are irl, especially if you have paid for said game. this is your right. as for the minority or softy arguments, these are pretty immature...we live in a society with rules, eve exists within this society so it must abide by it's rules. and eve may be an international game, but it's devs are based in iceland and iceland has very strong anti discriminatory laws. as for softy, well it takes more guts to stand up for a minority than to side with the status quo."
3/3/2009,btw the immaturity of some of you people it truly astounding...seriously you guys need to get laid...or at least leave your rooms once in a while and venture out into the real world.
3/3/2009,"i, too, am gay"
3/3/2009,"who the hell are you?you call us immature for pointing out the bull**** inherant in this ""proposal/issue/whine"" and then you start your judgements. go screw yourself pal, the only discrimination i see going on in this thread is against the intelligent among the eve population.also, to your little remark about how no one should be discriminated against. i guess you don't actually live in the real world, where it happens every day. to almost everyone in some way.all of you need to get some thicker skin, and stop bumping this nonsense to the front page, pushing genuine proposals back, proposals which could actually make the game better. thats what this board is for isn't it?oh yeah, and note the csm response/ amount of supports. this thread is a troll. period. i'll repeat myself, if a mod reads this, you should lock it. it's a mockery of the board."
3/3/2009,"i believe something ought to be done about the emergency warp and its exploitation by people traveling through hostile areas (i.e. traveling without a scout through low/null sec or traveling during a war). something should be done about people who abuse the emergency warp to get out of such hostile engagements, the remedy is to remove the emergency warp from player initiated warp scrambles or to start penalties against players who repeatedly abuse the emergency warp mechanic. the below was a post in a thread i had made ("
3/3/2009,"next time when your enter key is broken, just dont post.the problem is that freighters disapear after 60 seconds, + 30 seconds gate cloak = not enough time to kill them. that has nothing to do with e-warp."

3/3/2009,"please get the flaming off this board. this is for serious discussion...okay, maybe i need to be more clear about what i want to accomplish. i want it to be so that people cannot join a corp that's at war with you, attack you, then leave the corp without consequences. it's stupid and exploiting the game mechanics. they should have the 15 minute aggro timer like everyone else, or not have war rights for 24 hours after joining a corp."

3/3/2009,i'm embarrassed for you.
3/3/2009,"thought i was going to open this and find a good idea like, give capital tractor beams to other capital ships, but no"
3/3/2009,"so what you are saying is that you have repeatedly asked me to answer a question that you know i can't answer because the information i need to answer it is under nda. all i can say is this, if her other ideas were as brilliant as custom ship paint jobs then yes, we are all doomed. are there any other unanswerable questions you'd like me to take a stab at?"
3/3/2009,"yet again, i don't care how you and your corp enjoy themselves. i'm simply pointing out that keeping a casual family guild together for 3 years doesn't take any serious management skills. i don't want you to get an inflated head with this new csm power you have acquired.that's a pretty convincing argument, i think i'll concede that point. apparently those low sec miners were sneakier than i thought, or maybe they just weren't around when i was.this is just another balance of points. previously you said there wasn't much pvp in tada-o because industrial corps had other stuff to do. then when asked why you couldn't keep up with demand you make it sound like the buyers were at fault for wanting something quickly. a week or more is a long time to wait for something like a bc or bs.ahh there it is... i thought you had moved on? what allies did we stab in the back again? that's a new one. as for foom gutting anything, those rumors were completely false. we left more than half our corp hangar contents with bruce when we split and handed over some corp owned towers which were being used to hold sov. the only thing we took were a few members which were rl friends of some people in foom.and don't worry, i'm sleeping just fine.apparently that info is under nda so i can't see it. however as i mentioned above, if it's as good as custom ship paint i'm sure it will be groundbreaking in it's enhancement of eve."
3/3/2009,"we are a family? wow, i need to get more help with the chores around the house! as to the csm powers i have aquired? you still have no idea what the csm actually does do you?when you are living in a pocket of 0.0 being told that this ""amazing"" alliance you helped formed will assure your safety and your pipeline to get key minerals not found where you are then you are at the mercy of these ""amazing"" combat types. for three days prior to the freighter incedent bruce formed a blob, actually went into the system where i had puchased minerals, found only about a 1.5 to 1 ratio in their favor, turned and ran. i had an alt in the station and got to hear the pirates crack up over that. so i took maters into my own hands, made a reasonable business proposition to the locals a bruce got their ships.i have moved on, there is no post in my forums saying i need revenge against bruce. we would never waste a minute with something so wasteful and pointless. as for the back stabbing. lots of posts in coad at the time for anyone that wants to do some research.you have repeatedly stated you already had evidence of things i have said to support your case, now you are using my nda status to dodge that bullet. give me a break. put up or shut up niskin, you can't site anything to make your case about my horrible csm influences. you just want to hash over your sad panda melancholy caused by our continued success because if we aren't something horrible and failing then you can't make your case that leaving us shows how smart you are.issler"
3/3/2009,"the reality of the matter is you are still posting because we have entertained your delusions. delusions which you are now using a nda to cover up. i will no longer entertain them, and i encourage others to follow suit. i have no further questions. thank you for your input."
3/3/2009,i support this product and/or service.
3/3/2009,"a family guild is a concept not an actual collection of family members, although technically they could be. as for what a csm does, so far they eat lamb sandwiches and attend meetings where they make suggestions to try and improve the game. the lamb sandwiches might be optional though.that's what i was looking for, thanks for the explanation. back in those days, facing those opponents, we did often have to run from fights when we had a numerical advantage. they had more skillpoints and tougher ships along with better fittings. we went to syndicate with the understanding that we were a severe underdog and we picked our fights because of it. i still don't understand why you chose to deal with the pirates instead of raising the issue at the alliance rep level though.ok i'll look for those before i comment on that.i've repeatedly stated that i have evidence? that's funny i don't see that anywhere. what i do see is myself repeatedly referring to things i pulled from the minutes and stating that based on those things and what i knew of you from the past that i was concerned with the kind of suggestions you were making on 0.0 issues."

3/4/2009,"definatly think missle stats need to be reviewed.stealth bombers and expecially bombs need some extra attentionon bmombs something along the line of explosion radius to 150 would give you a chance at poping a cruiser, frigs would have to get out of area, bs would be fine. @ 5m isk a pop they should do some damage if people are within blast range. currently your bairly scratching a frigates shields. fleet fights it would encourage people to be spread out and you have the option still of killing the bomber or the bomb."
3/4/2009,"indeed, stealth bombers were crippled by the changes to missiles. they badly need a bonus to explosion velocity and/or an improvement to bombs.however have you noticed the lack of response from our much vaulted csms or ccp?...."
3/4/2009,"funny i pop frigates with two volleys when i use 2 target painters =dactually the ""nerf"" was a buff. now i can hit small stuff, before my missiles hit for 0.1 dmg.if you want hit a speedy ship for full dmg, use webs.now gief me all your caldari carebears stuff plz, you have no use for it this thread proofs it!"
3/4/2009,signed...i say hell no to the missile nerf. being caldari aint easy these days...sigh

3/4/2009,"not signed. minmatar jocks now have a use for their target painter ""racial ecm"" bonus. a target useing a afterburner will get smacked fairly hard by missiles if it is target painted and webed. it won't be full damage, but alot more than what a turret ship will be doing against the same target."
3/4/2009,"i will sign this as who doesn't want their weapon of choice buffed, but tbh i saw a minimal decrease in effectiveness of my missiles after the patch. the only ships i have problems hitting for full damage are the ones i should have a problem with, ie frigates with the cruise missiles."
3/4/2009,"agree that the nerf needs to be though about atleast, im sure ccp nerfed it for some reason but i don't think they did a good job with it this time.i spent a bit of time away from eve, about a year, and wow did it hit me when i did my first mission. before i left i could bust in and finish a mission 10 times faster than now."
3/4/2009,"and it will be smacked pretty hard by anything else other then missiles...remember missile boats 99% of the time need midslots fo tank - thats why people dont like caldari - now they need webs and target painters etc so now they suck 100%new drake fit7x hmlwarp scram, 2x web, 2x target painter, 10mn mwd4x bcu^now it has ok dps, and does max damage to cruiser and higher"

3/4/2009,"/not signedmissiles were put back in line with other weapon systems, that's all...you seriously think normal that you could hit target with torps, which is supposed to be a close range weapon, at 70-80kms ? no.you think normal that missiles in general should hit for 100% damage all the time ? no.tracking is to guns what explosion velocity is for missiles.this wasn't a nerf at all.at least for torpedoes, it was a hell of a boost. ok they reduced the range drastically, but they could have left it that way. istead, they gave it a drastic rate of fire increase to torps.sounds like a boost to me.now you want to hit for more damage ? fit a target painter, and train signature focusing to 4/5.see it like that : target painters is to missiles what tracking comps are for guns.that's it.my 2 isk.and yes, i'm caldari"

3/4/2009,"incorrect, any movement from the target reduces damage. even if transversal is 0. unlike turrets, missiles will do less damage to a target coming right at them. missiles need a lot work to be balanced, when you couple flight speed with the long cycle times of launchers things just don't balance out."

3/4/2009,"i've had a fair amount of experience lately with missiles being in the gallente militia, and they are by no way underpowered.yes, heavy missiles will do pretty low damage to me if i am afterburnering (in a rifter), but guess what? thorax's do 0 damage to me in that situation.but the bcu assault missile launcher caracal with lse? that hurts. a lot. ab rifter with 200mm plate + repper or a 400mm plate cannot stand up to it for more than 30 seconds, even when i am not webbed. webbed, i go down pretty hard. (a light ammo type getting bonus's on a cruiser? that's pretty nice)those am's are even better than light neutron or ion turrets, which i can actually get to miss me a lot with a 500m orbit if the other pilot's ship is slow enough, and i am not webbed.missiles are not underpowered by any means... i fear caracals a lot more than i fear thoraxes."

3/4/2009,"well the only fix i'd see is to add some sort of collision damage independant from the usual base/damage-type damage, which wouldn't be related to the known 4 damage types, and would do significant damage to a target having a near-0 transversal but high speed. kinda."
3/4/2009,"fix unguided missiles, and give us target painters, that actually match the range of cruise missiles.and god damn yes, i think it is fair a weapon system with delayed damage offers better range on a ship with range bonus then pulse lasers on a range bonused laser ship."
3/4/2009,"one way to fix missiles would simply to increase the damage bonus form the warhead upgrades skill, it currently only givng a bad % per level for such a high rank skill.make it 5% per skill elvel, not 2%, and it would all work out."

3/4/2009,i think this would be a nice feature for corp and alliance chat.
3/4/2009,i agree with this however.. eve is an mmo where low skill players can be victorious over players with actual skill due to the skill treadmill. if when a war was declared and a player was suddenly limited a total sp cap while the war was active you;d see actual pvp and not mmo losers griefing lowbies.. i am returning to fps.. pvp in eve interested me for as long as it took me to understand exaclty what pvp in an mmo environment means.if i made an mmo there would not be the concept of leveling or skills.. just you and your wits... the landscape and mechanics at your command or someone elses what ever.. but not being able to pilot a ship the equivalent of your enemy even though you can afford it really destroys the illusion that there is even pvp in eve... the reality is cvc character vs character and you know what.. i am actually thinking of taking another look at wow and seeing how it is coming along... but i wont because i know that all that storyline npc quest crap will still be there. so yeah.. axel's experiment into mmos is over and the battlefields of armed assault 2 await me. i will miss my corp mates but not the ass hats that made its such a struggle to enjoy eve. and you know what its utterly hilarious sickly stupidly amusing that the upcoming release of walking in stations and new stuff that new players wont be able to use... it really interested me.. but i realize that it wont get rid of the terrible problem with reavers that the empire authorities do nothing to stamp out.i've been eaten enough times.. i think i can lay my character to rest and stop feeding the reaver piranhas
3/4/2009,"resources are hard to come by.. and it is the reason for war declarations. you people have no idea what the ""carebears"" are doing. they are making your stupid pvp possible by supplying vast amounts of minerals, ships, modules, ammunition and everything else to you only to get griefed and slammed for playing the hard game and running the eve economy. the player i have quoted here is the perfect example of a reaver. a totally mindless killer who casually refers to the destruction of the aspirations of other players as ""pew pew"".this is why in rl empires were forged with the millions who banded together in order to defend themselves from swirling evil of pure chaos...on the subject of swirling chaos.. when i visit nulsec and see all those untouched belts and realise the massive potential there but then attempt to speak to a local reaver gang and get chased off for spying so me and my ""carebear"" corp have to stay in highsec and be insulted...so stupid.. so sad. and all based on the ability of an old character to hide behind their char sheet and insult ""carebears"".how about you bring it to an fps server and i'll paint the server red with your unskilled rl minds slow reflexes and lack of instinct or you can do that to me... either way its fun... not like here"

3/4/2009,"ive written a multi-user client/server market analysis application in c++ with igb integration that's now grown to around 5000 lines long. it aggregates data in real time from any combination of users(users choice, permissions based, etc) on the system, as well as evecentral. the mysql database only tracks current market conditions as opposed to historical data(since i'm only worried about buying something somewhere, and selling it immediately somewhere else).this is not a debate, i am telling you that there generally are no other options unless you want to fly amok all over highsec trying to find enough goods to make a decent profit. remember its not only a mater of price, it's a matter of volume. often its simply not possible to find enough volume of something to get a reasonable portion of your capitol into product to ship outside of jita. (not always true, but frequently true). sure if your just an occasional buyer, looking to buy some ship or something theirs plenty of small volume deals out there, but if you want to buy a ton of something, its very likely going to be in one of the market centers, and more often than not, in jita.the generation of market centers is inevitable, unchangeable human behavior so long as you have to transport goods from one station to another, and so long as you have regional markets. that should not be changed either since it works very well, this is not wow after all where things can be instantly moved anywhere. the solution is to make jita better, as i told you before its not ""1 mil"" difference, its often 10-20 mil difference in final profit, or even the ability to make anything relevant at all (im not going to do 30 jumps for 3 million profit obviously). traders go to jita because its profitable and worth it for them to do it, if they had a reasonable alternative they wouldn't (and i don't when i do).you have not given one solution besides ""don't go there"", as such your just a troll.here's a possible real solution:"
3/4/2009,so you can write 5000 lines of code.whoopee... i'm an it professional too... and that means crap to me.so other than inflating your pompous ego.. i got 2 words for youalliance tournamentread the bloody news posts about that.in case your too stubbron to look.a corp decided to raise the market prices on several key peices of equipment... they went all over new eden and successfully... cornered the market.if a single player can do that... anyone can do that.you buy your product elsewhere.... and you keep buying it elsewhere.you sell it elsewhere.you don't need 5000 lines of code to do that.stop going to jitathat is not a debate.its a fact.
3/4/2009,"your comparing apples to oranges here. buying up large quantities of something in order to raise its price requires vast sums of capitol (certainly more than most people have including me). honestly i'm not even sure what your suggesting at this point. you recognize that jita has a population issue, yet you are just saying ""don't go to jita"". this isn't about me, even if it was an option for me to go elsewhere all the time (which it isn't), it still wouldn't solve the problem. jita would still have the same issue. i'm suggesting a real solution, to a real problem. we both know that telling people to ""gtfo"" isn't going to solve it, it never does. additional infrastructure is the key, if you have a better solution, feel free to suggest it.i'm not posting in assembly hall because i wan't someone to fix some issue specific to me, i'm posting because this issue will at any given time be affecting around 1 in 35 people."
3/4/2009,how can i spell it out for you people to understand it.... its so easy.jita is jita because the market is there.... people use it.so stop using teh frakking market and go elsewhere!it's not rocket science... even a kid can figure it out.so your spending a few million isk more than you want... whoop de frakking do... the isk is easy to make up.... so make up a few more and deal with it.or build your own damn market.the example is to point out how easy it is to manipulate the market.so stop being a penny pincher and a lazy ass and just get to it.if i can do it... so can you.i didn't have to go to jita to buy an orca.. we could have easy made up the extra 50mil in rens to buy it.... instead we wanted one right away....you can make suggestions until your blue in the face.... the market is player driven and controlled.... so be a player and move away from jita!stop going there.
3/4/2009,"just stop. if you don't have a response to the problem that would actually solve the problem (for everyone). then there's no need to reply any more, your statements are off topic.there are plenty of ways to make money without going to jita, nobody is arguing that. there are plenty of ways to make money that do involve jita however, and some people are there for other unrelated reasons as well. regardless of the reason there are 915 people in jita (2.2% of eve's total population) right now that have decided that its worth it for them to be there for one reason or another. many of those people are in transit, so the actual % of people that are effected during a day of gameplay is going to be much higher. this topic is about improving the experience for those people."
3/4/2009,"amazing thread, i am sure to have already read the first 7 posts verbatim several times. about the op idea. so you want several system with linked markets for your convenience. at that point can we (i.e. the rest of eve players) get the same feature in our regional hubs or it will be only a caldari/jita prerogative?i operate near amarr, it would be nice to use stations 1 system removed from it to build stuff and sell it in the whole hub. same for reins and heck or oursulaert. at that point why hubs would be the only system to benefit for a so nice feature? make villore a hub, i can build items in artant and sell in low sec in old man star without problems. intant transportation through a dangerous hi sec/low sec gate without troubles with the militia.to put it simply: no instant transportation of your stuff so that it can be sold in several system at the same time without any risk or work."
3/4/2009,"as you point out you certainly would not want to have instantaneous transport of items between points of interest. venkul mul, i agree with your general sentiment *entirely*, however i think this general idea could be laid out in such a way that doesn't give anyone an advantage or added safety. it's basically just taking jita as it exists, and splitting up the traffic in to more manageable portions.an arrangement of systems like this should only be used where server hardware/software performance cannot keep up with the demand. i go to the other economic centers frequently too, like amarr. i have not seen their populations high enough to cause problems yet. if amarr did start having 900+ people consistently, then you certainly could use a similar model to help distribute the load there as well.the diagram i made isn't perfect, it would have to be remade by the devs to ensure that the traffic flowed through it naturally and as intended. however marketers shouldn't be getting any real advantage distance wise with this setup, the number of hops from point to point doesn't really change if your visiting a border system. (the only systems that would have shared markets are systems a,b,c,d and jita (not any further than that).the starmap surrounding the jita area remains exactly the same."

3/4/2009,"sorry, i should have checked the paragraphs before posting, have editted it and made it a bit more readable now.there's obviously a bit of confusion about how ewarp works and what we want changing about it, we still want ewarp, just if you happen to get tackled during the ewarp then you should gain the aggression timer and stay tackled for the 15 minute duration. i've outlined ewarp currently works below.if you have an agression timer and are warp scrambled you will stay in that spot for 15 minutes then warp & disappear.if you have an agression timer and are not warp scrambled you will be warped to a safe spot, where your ship will wait in space for 15 minutes before disappearing, during this time it can be probed out.if you do not have an agression timer and are warp scrambled you will stay in that spot for 1 minute then warp and disappear.if you do not have an agression timer and are not warp scrambled you will be warped to a safe spot where your ship will wait in space for 1 minute before disappearing, during this time it can be probed out.now, as far as ratting / missioning goes you're going to have an agression timer anyway, so will remain warp scrambled for 15 minutes if rats warp scramble you, if they do not then you will be warped off to a safe spot for 15 minutes. that's fine.if someone disconnects during warp or whilst mining without a timer, then they'll be warped to a safe spot for 1 minute, that's fine too.what's not fine is when someone jumps a ship with a large buffer through gates, then upon finding themselves in a hostile environment disconnect their client deliberately which leads to them being tackled for one minute before being warped off. in a real situation if they'd stayed connected they would have been destroyed, if they had aggression and were disconnected they would have been destroyed. why the difference? what we want is for ships tackled during the emergency warp to remain tackled for 15 minutes. otherwise emergency warp is fine as is."

3/4/2009,"]balancing stuff > new stuff,i agree, except that ccp are implementing things like t3 without rebalancing things for the lower end.i would rather have new low end stuff that have it ignored like it currently is.(also, the harbinger has 7 turrets, give the hurricane its 7th turret back. :( )"
3/4/2009,"i would have especially liked to have been able to pilot a transport that could at least have the power to drive off a lone frigate as a destroyer can. and i was especially incensed by players destroying my cargo never with the intention of stealing it as a real ""pirate"" would so i'd like to see a transport with about destroyer level weapons. there are enough pvp ships. adding more pvp ships would add nothing to the game.i just canceled my subscription because i was destroyed again by a player who obliterated my cargo with no intention to steal it. so work on ship balances may have helped retain my patronage."
3/4/2009,forgot to support more t1 ships. i might point out the clash between galleons and frigates in rl as an example for my post.
3/4/2009,"well this might just be my missionrunner pov.but generally speaking caldari and amarr space are fine when it comes to missionhubs , both factions have access to multiple system with decent quality agents or medium quality agents in 0.5/0.6 surrounded by highsec which rewardwise is rather equal to having a q18 agent in a 0.7/0.8.minmatar on the other hand got a serious congestion problem with dodixie as their only good highsec l4 system. yes there are others but they either have lowsec borders , or are low/medium quality agents in too high secstatus systems meaning the isk/hour factor is too low to make it worthwhile.gallente is a bit like the matari but not to the same degree.and yes motsu is a notorious laggy missionhub but the caldari state has a halfdozen corporations with l4 agents in solid highsec(no low sec borders). meaning that the problem is more a case of lemmings than actual congestion."

3/4/2009,i disagree. the in-game courier system is fine. the only problem with it is the players.
3/5/2009,with a modular pos system we could some day have ambulation on our own stations!
3/5/2009,"we could have alliance buddies with there own corp hangers in our pos'es, with full access to labs etc.astro farms, farm module+soil+plant seeds = - 1% oxygen use per hour. cattle farms. ccp could develop it in many ways. if ccp is interested in changing sov to industry based. this is the way to go"
3/5/2009,"/signedi have a suggestion or two.1st: new skill: hack equipment - requires anchoring v and hacking v. allows use of advanced equipment codebreaker. reduces hack time by 10% per level2nd: new equipment - advanced equipment codebreaker. i /ii. requires hack equipment skill i/iv: t1 version acts as codebreaker, also allows access to anchored secure containers (criminal flagging as per can flipping on any attempt) base time to access container 30 seconds times size of container (small secure = 1, medium secure = 1.5, large secure = 2, giant secure =3) cannot hack structures. t2 version: as per t1 reduces base time for containers to 15 seconds. allows hacking of anchored structures that are off-line (such as an out of fuel/ out of reinforced mode pos) and associated equipment. base time is 1000 seconds times size of equipment (small rail = 1, medium = 2, etc.. hangers and labs would be a 3 control towers would start at 4 for a small tower and ramp up) would be ciminally flagged and would give kill rights to entire target corp for 1 week per attempted hack to run similtaniously (i.e. - you hack a tower and 2 labs they have 3 kill rights on you for the next week) this will get rid of the clutter in space, solve the problem with macro miners, provide some high sec piracy etc.also perhapse modify the electronic attack ships to allow them to attempt to hack a pos in reinforced mode, using the above gear & skills this will spice up alliance play i imagine.just some thoughts..tribe"
3/5/2009,"arazu/lachesis definitely need to get their ew looked at. i think a optimal range bonus similar to the falcons would bring it in line.arazu/lachesis dampening the 200km falcons bringing them closer to the fight would be something.. (before you flame, i fly falcons :p)arazu/lachesis are still very decent pvp ships for close/medium range stuff. very situational, but no more or less so than the other recons."
3/5/2009,"i honesty doubt ccp sometime when they say they will see how it goes and make adjustments later.... rsds have been a dead horse for over a year now, and falcons rule the roost.please take some action on this!"
3/5/2009,"support [x]my suggestion:change arazu/lachesis dmg bonus to a fall-off bonus.arazu/lachesis should be able to damp falcons inside fall-off range of damps. not up to 250km, becausecaldari=long range and ecm chance based."

3/5/2009,yeah nice article. if you fought for us this hard we'd have a new pos system by late next week.
3/5/2009,this is exactly it. actualy it's what ccp thinks is best and the csm can only influence minor things. that's why persisting on the pos redesign is important. fancy new features have precedense over fixing important game mechanics ... great game design ...

3/5/2009,my post is very relative to how missiles are now.i know about precisions and rockets... hop in you drake or what-ever and bump a battleship and watch your damage drop... the point of the topic still remains... you might not like my sarcasm but well that's how i talk sometimes.

3/5/2009,here
3/5/2009,"oh god. missile range advantage became stronger because ships got slower and range became more meaningful, plus missile boats are now able to defend that range advantage.drake has always had to web its target, to stop it just mwding off and laughing at you.qr was a boost to missile pvp. remember missiles doing 0.1 damage to anything >4 km/s?but why am i bothering to write this, you haven't got a clue about game mechanics or missile pvp, as your drake lolfit shows. i can't believe that you're whining about not always doing 100% damage when this didn't happen before qr anyway."

3/5/2009,this is very true. my nag in siege doesnt need to even run reppers it mitigates soo much damage by its amazing speed tank...17 pages and still no real response other then ccp will take it into consideration when they review cap ships...
3/5/2009,"now mixing heat damage with the new repair system means motherships become more proactive as mobile bases of operation, as do friendly titans. titan effects are crippling without being obnoxiously devastating. titans, moms, defense:in addition to the change in dd's roles, i think the titans need to get a defensive bonus and yet another hp buffer. for motherships, just a hp buffer. rather than siege, which seems to be the popular quick fix idea, my solution is to add the common 25% resist or 37.5% active repairs to each ship in accordance to their race. however, for each lvl of titan, add an additional 5% to the primary enemy damage source. so for an avatar, that would be 25% resist with a 50% bonus at lvl 5 for explosive damage. to date, tanks have never saved a titan. they haven't even prolonged them. titans are either ganked, or not lost, it's just that simple. motherships are even worse because they've had more opportunities to be on the field with dreads active. their problem is, before anything can be done to save them, a few dozen dreads can drop them without issue. so for motherships, a hp buffer is more geared to allow better spider tanks. simply put, there has to be more reason to justify their cost. we know there is a change coming to 0.0 sov mechanics. it's probably going to be on par with the nano nerf in it's severity. at the moment, a mothership's last saving grace is it's affectiveness under a cyno jammer. when that's removed, what will it have left? give it hp, give it docking and fleet jumping, give it repairing.apocrypha effects on these changes:one of the beauties of these ideas are how they work with t3. docking inside capitals can open the doors to reset ships at a mobile base.. not just refit them, but rebuild them on site. some wormholes allow motherships in currently. so i say increase the potential to allow titans in, but remove pos structures and cloaking for all ships except recons. this means capitals become the foreground bases of operations in wormholes. yet, why risk a titan if you cant cloak it, thus creating the balance between economies of scale. carriers and rorqs become just as effective and useful, just with smaller capacities for ships/cargo. local changes mean you'll never know these ships are present, which creates the ""discovery of a lifetime opportunities for pvp""t3 also receives a bonus to heat damage reduction, meaning 1 doomsday under the proposed mechanics cannot incap it's modules even if the effect lands. it actually creates more of a purpose for the introduction and implementation of t3 designs and it's future development. it creates a logical purpose for why it's needed."
3/5/2009,"more asinine ddd change ideas.ddd is dumb idea, don't fix it, get rid of the goddamn thing.and you just grouped together a bunch of ideas so even if we agree with one of them we aren't gonna thumbs it."

3/5/2009,"yeah, missile nerf is fine and this is the wrong thread for complaining about it. makes you look stupid. also, if no csm wants to support it, don't you think there is a reason why? (its fine, learn to play).anyway, i support this topic. --isaac"

3/5/2009,"the thing is. do you really need to boost them? is there really people who arent using the ship now because of these things?the real stuff we need to be allowed is cans.go watch one of the farjung wannabe vids. how they manage their cap. the cap800s are in a can giving him 1-2 more caps which could mean win or lose.i cant see why we need drones in the cargo. they can go in the carrier's corp hangar. bubbles should be fine.liquid ozone is the giant one. used for cynos, jumpbridges, etcetc. such a major one."
3/5/2009,"or, instead of just allowing two or three items you mentioned they could just allow anything.of course people are using the ship despite these drawbacks. does that mean the whole remote corporate hangars thing isn't terrible in it's current state? no.people use it because it's all there is. all the op is asking is that ccp give us a break now that they've made untouchable jump freighters.."
3/5/2009,lots of thing in eve have a stasis period and some are more needed/logical than others but this should certainly have such a cooldown period. it's just not logical to not have it in place.

3/5/2009,i oppositley oppose this.
3/5/2009,"that is going to/already causing issues and to be frank i'm not happy with how rl cash has an effect on gameplay like that. no real idea on how to solve this without further knowledge on the subject (cba with rmt etc) but it does need to be looked into.on an unrelated note; as i see it lavista is one of the few csm that 'operate' within the spirit of the csm idea and has been doing so for 2 terms now, well done. didn't vote for you nor actually know you but it has to be said."
3/5/2009,i honestly dont know what ccp can do about it.from ccp's point of view... person 1 transfers large amount of isk to person 2. which gets the flag off. they look at person 1's transactions and discover that it isn't rmt person xfering tons and tons of isk all the time.beyond that... what can ccp do?i guess you could sue the person in small claims court.does that mean rmt can claim that it's all happening in rl? no.
3/5/2009,so when somebody is that stupid to send you money for an in game loan you can keep it since it's a gift.if you want it back try to go to court and see what gives.
3/5/2009,"as i illustrated (briefly) in the linked thread (all while quite merrily intoxicated) i'm inclined think that keeping the status quo is the best way to handle this, rather than make a fuss to ccp about it in the hope they'll write something else down for us to abide by ...if people are already performing loans of in-game isk with rl money held as security then i'm not going to get myself up in arms over it. as far as i'm concerned it just makes it easier for isk to move around inside the economy if (for example) someone has an idea to generate in-game profit but can't raise the capital quickly enough via more traditional means which are already accepted by the community in order to exploit the time critical window of opportunity which has been identified.if anything, i'm further inclined to think it acts like gtc trading - as an incentive not to use the rmt websites we have to put up with being spammed towards in-game and which are also probably behind most account theft and hacking reported. it may not be a huge incentive, but i think anything that draws business from those sons of *****es is a good thing.however,if such exchanges are in fact being or were to be performed with the intent to rmt instead, i don't see how legislating against this particular method will curtail rmt in any worthwhile fashion. legislation is great until it falls down in the face of being unable to be enforced effectively or fairly and in this case i think responsible enforcement by ccp will be difficult, to say the least - especially when intermediaries could act as escrow agents within private, player arranged organisations: hint, hint!that being said i know virtually nothing about the tools ccp wield and the methodologies they indulge in to sniff out rmt malefactors. all i know is that i think it will be impractical - an edict with all the authority of those little ""please do not walk on the grass!"" signs in the park while almost every beat cop in town who'd write you up for doing it is legally blind.meanwhile, (and as i have said previously) changing the eula to proscribe against rl securities being used in in-game isk loans strikes me as snapping off an evolutionary branch from the tree because we're afraid of the thorns it may develop once it has grown and matured. i don't think we should be pre-emptively pruning the development of the economy like that - on a whim.especially in this game and especially when the rl securities themselves are completely outside the control of ccp anyway.which is probably why the thread linked almost immediately got this as a concise response, anyway."
3/5/2009,"i think ccp should retain it's current stance of not directly covered by the elua. i think they should do this for several reasons which i'll just lay out right here.1) unenforcable2) premature3) outside of the scope and responsibility of the companyif people want to secure in game assets with rl currency // items then there is literally nothing ccp can do to stop it. catching rmt people is hard enough as it is, and is in most cases probably based around speculation. can ccp prove without a doubt that if joe recieved 10 billion isk from fjaakj for a single tritanium that it was an rmt. no they can't, and it clearly is. now lets imagine some semi reputable player does a loan based on rl assets. can ccp now prove to the degree of issuing a ban, even internally that joe recieved 10 billion isk from sally for real life assets. i doubt that as well."
3/5/2009,its called common sense.if people don't have brains enough to figure that out... they deserved to get ripped off.
3/5/2009,"it's not so much that they can get ripped off (don't care about that). it's more the fact that with this method trading,favours, rmt and metagaming can prosper beyond control (even more than now)."
3/5/2009,"the reason to explicitly state that it would be forbidden is that more or less its not really a form of rmt, its more a form of isk laundering for ill gotten gains, rmt, and exploits."

3/5/2009,"i've bolded the part that breaks your own argument.how can something be 100% safe, but have a exception, or did you just decide to ignore it?"

3/5/2009,"i mentioned this in my post on mitigating jita lag, however it got a little lost in the discussion. it stands alone as a suggestion so i will repost it here.having only one vector that ships leave stations on creates a perpetual traffic wreck of ships outside busy stations (ships crashing into each other at station exit).fixing this is fortunately easy, simply add numerous exit vectors from stations and use them in a round-robin way, this ensures some spacing between ships allowing them time to get to warp. the exit portal graphics are large enough to accommodate this without changes."
3/5/2009,"this has already been posted in another thread. (not yours) its questionable if its a good idea or not. although i would like to see it, i think ccp has more issues to fix than station undocking. --isaac"
3/5/2009,"it's a small issue, but it should be a very easy one to resolve. helps immersion too, seeing all these ships crashing/bouncing into each other is rather unseemly."
3/5/2009,"i don't like this - it's immersion-breaking. every station has a fairly obvious docking area. ships exiting from random locations that are not near the docking area would just be strange. i would like to have some sort of ""traffic control"" information available to a pilot who is in dock. an airplane taking off from an airport has information about the location of other planes in the area. a space station should be able to relay basic information to the captain of an ship prepped for undocking about the ships outside the station."
3/5/2009,"thumbs down.having a docking vector requires people to be aware, which is good.it rewards the prepared in many ways."
3/5/2009,"you misunderstood, it would be at the same location (the docking area), but instead everyone of exiting the station on the *exact* same line, they would exit using several different lines. the docking area is very large, so everyone is still going to be flying out of it like they are now, but instead of flying out of it along the same line (knocking into each other immediately on exit, exiting within each others ships, etc) there will be some proper separation.this essentially could be looked at as a minimal amount of exactly that (i'm a pilot actually). air traffic controller's job is to maintain separation between aircraft, and it's the pilots job to obey the traffic controllers when in controlled airspace. a decent analogy would go like this: right now we have one runway leaving the docking bay, this proposal would create multiple more runways leaving the docking bay which would then be used alternately."
3/5/2009,yes yes yes yes!im tired of looking up the tailpipe of a freighter or some jackass in a battleship camping the station.supported!and im not talking in front of the station... 360 degrees of exit vectors.if we can enter the station in 360... we can exit it the same way.
3/5/2009,"it's good to know we can agree on something on basic principal, so i'm reluctant to even post a reply. i would like to point out however that 360 degrees of exit vectors around the station (exiting randomly anywhere around the station just like you can enter it, if i understand you correctly) would essentially eliminate station campers (wouldn't it?, i'm not a combat pilot yet, but i think the range of a station end to end would pretty much make it impossible). since that would change some game mechanics i would suggest that it would be hard to gain consensus for.however looking up the tailpipe of freighters so to speak certainly can be eliminated easily without changing any game mechanics."
3/5/2009,"figured this would be a good place to ask this. could we ask ccp to institute a policy of dating the subject lines in the information portal? this would make it easier to find the most recent post about a topic. i guess it gets old seeing 90%+ of the post with new in the subject when i go there. just replace ""new"" with the date that it gets posted."

3/5/2009,"more than most other games, the meta gaming aspect of eve is much amplified. however only the forums are available out of game. to access one's evemail, one must log into the game client.i would like to propose the creation of an eve online messenger (eom).objective of eom:to enable access to the character's eve mail, mailing lists, buddy list and select channels ingame while not having access to, or not being able to open the full eve online client.this will allow eve online players to stay incontact with the rest of the player base when not ingame, being able to respond to mails and chat with others.possible problems:1) being able to access all channels while ingame can lead to abusement by using messenger clients to scout locations using 'local'.to combat this, the usage of this client should also disallow the participation and access to location specific channels like 'local' and 'constellation'.2) the player using this client is in a state of (for better lack of a word) undeadness. neither online nor offline. to correct this, a new 'online (in messenger)' status will have to be created. this might be the biggest stumbling block as i do not think that ccp might have anticipated the need to have more than 2 values for online/offline.would appreciate any comments and further ideas."

3/5/2009,"sorry, but to me your reply sound exactly ""i don't want to implement instantaneous transport, but i want it implemented when it suites me"". look again what i wrote: your idea would be linking several stations with all the production facilities in them, allowing in reality for a multi-race, multi-corp research+production mega station. instead of paying for the rent of a office in jita 4-4 a corp could rent a office in new caldari for a fraction of the jita cost, probably with building facilities at hand and supply the hub without any problem. the ""cure"" seem way worse than the malady."
3/5/2009,"and he calls me a moron (implied) for my suggestion of shopping somewhere else.its a player driven market.... so start competing with jita and get everyone to start selling product for less than the jita market.it's perfectly valid suggestion... its easy.... if you get off your lazy ass and do it that is.jita will be always be as laggy ""as you claim it to be"" (as i don't see the problem from my end and i'm on a crappy 1.5mb/s connection here).i always love it when players sell products for less ""away"" from the market hubs... it's quite refreshing.but when you refuse to do that.... you make the problem worse.your idea makes a simple problem a very complicated one...as it was already pointed out...as a programmer even you should know that the kiss principle is very important.programming 101... keep it simple stupid.market hubs are created by players.... not by the game.... you could kill jita, lock it down, tax it, chain up the stations 3 systems around, blah blah blah... it will sprout up somewhere else.ccp won't do a damn thing about it because it would require changing the game mechanics to such a degree as altering a well rooted database.... and for someone who claims to be an expert in programming... you obviously have no idea what your getting yourself into.all ccp will do is increase the bandwidth load and cap a player population limit in jita... and they already have done that.and sorry to say... but your outnumbered here... we don't see the lag... so either your infected with a virus/spyware (likely as most people think they are safe when they are not) or your cable is fracked over.until you get it through your thick skulls.... you won't get me to budge an inch.that's why its not a debate or up for discussion... its a fact.again... stop going to jita... when other people catch on... it will be no busier than rens... or hek... or any other market hub."
3/5/2009,"i was probably too harsh, i just find it irritating when people belittle a topic, instead of working with it. instead of discussing the topic i spend a bunch of effort explaining why i know what i'm talking about. what you do in game no doubt works for you, and there are plenty of ways of making money that do not involve jita as you pointed out. there are others that do, and as long as its financially worth going to jita (or wherever it may be) they will, and this problem will remain.new caldari would not be linked with jita as it wouldn't be one of the new load balancing systems. however that's a good point anyway, what would be wrong with simply not permitting research, production, etc at any jita linked system then? if that's not an option, you could also make it such that any linked station is essentially the same station, therefore you wouldn't have an ability to have multiple offices, production queues, etc, it would all just be the same place so you wouldn't be able to exploit it.yeah and this is likely the simplest approach. naturally it would be much better if they could optimize the code further to support more players, or add more hardware. however both have likely already happened. it's more likely that eve's current design only scales on a per system basis. for example, the eve server likely allows a single server to handle multiple star systems, but it probably does not allow multiple servers to service a single star system.therefore i would speculate that they have one really fast, kick ass server dedicated to jita, and despite this it is still getting into a situation where the load is too much. so the options are to either keep the existing design, and use in-game methods to better distribute the load (as this suggestion outlines). or to change the design to allow better scalability within a single system (much much harder). there is a 3rd option, but i don't like it and i doubt anyone else does either, you could instance jita. that would be really lame though. drastic measures like rewriting bits of server code in c++ could also be thought of... but ccp would hate that idea too since it would be a major undertaking.exactly, which is why you have to deal with the problem as it exists.go there when there's 1100 people in the system and tell me that.... it's a bit like a black hole at that point, have fun getting back out lol."
3/5/2009,i have.... and the only problem i have is getting through the mass of ships... not the internet connection.your jumping at shadows.... your indicating there's a problem with the system when the problem is rooted by the very players who control the market.you want a solution? move the market... diversefy it... spread it out... make the players push harder for markets in backwater stations... spread it around.jita is not the problem.... its the people who are creatures of habbit.fixing the system will not work.you already have obviously indicated your acknowledgment of this. it's like saying there's a problem with war-decs (and there is) but asking for a solution to the problem with an amorphous idea is like pouring gas on a fire.... and everyone learns real quick (those who try...even myself) that the problem is far more complicated then they ever imagined.you need to keep it very simple....and asking ccp to rig the system for your so called favor is going to be shot down quicker than warp drive.you need to push for a more diverse market.... get the players to shift there goods of sale and there buying power elsewhere.... perhaps skills that let you purchase your goods and have them shipped...at that point its a pointless matter of where you place products. shipping of course should have a fee attached and possibly able to be intercepted by pirates to keep our friendly yarr'ers who are rabbid and foaming at the mouth.even then put the freighters to work and have them ship the goods on behalf of npc's for standings.there are far better ways to go about this..... but having jita rigged for the sake of jita lag is not the answer.
3/5/2009,"bad idea again:1) jita is jita (between other things) because it has 14 stations in system, with 6 stations with factory facilities;2) adjacent systems see another 18 (s&o) stations with factories;3) jita and the adjacent systems have stations controlled by several different corporations (even if all caldari or jove). i all the stations would become the ""same"" station the net result would be:1) 24 industrial stations will become 1 with a net loss in production capabilities;2) the players that have raised standing to get a lower station tax with corporation that aren't caldari navy will lose the bonus;3) the offices in something like 50 stations (i haven't spent the time counting them) will become those available in 1 station.doing that would probably kill jita as a trade hub, even if that didn't happened it would inconvenience greatly a lot of people. on the flipside jita lag is generally bearable. so don't break what is working decently. edit: please link those images, they are breaking the forum formatting."
3/5/2009,"just have each jita load balancing system be functionally identical to jita with each station linked with its counterpart. no standings issues, no increase or decrease of production/research, etc. the new systems don't need to be artistically the same of course. keep in mind they don't even have to be ""systems"" per se, you could artistically represent them as different parts of the same system, and replace the jump gate graphics with acceleration pads, though they would technically work the same as different systems anyway.continuing to reiterate the idea that people could just move away from jita is meaningless. its akin to suggesting that we could solve urban congestion in real life by telling people to leave, it just doesn't work that way. cities solve the problem by building infrastructure.in the end it doesn't much matter what i say here because if the problem gets much worse the dev's will have to address it, and i can bet you that if the technical problems exist as i suspect they do, that they will resolve the problem in the general way that i have described. eventually, given the currently technology in eve, a form of station linking over load balancing systems is almost inevitable."
3/5/2009,no its not...and it will never work that way.are you even reading my posts? let alone paying attention? or am i just talking to a brick wall!seriously... i suggest you start reading and doing a bit of research before you come up with hair brained ideas about station linking and load balancing.your trying to program up something that is entirely controlled by players.stop while your ahead.
3/5/2009,"unfortunately i have read all of your posts, your a broken record. telling people to leave jita as a solution to jita's lag is not a solution, and will not happen. go make your own jita as you suggested, when it exists my application will find it, and i'll go there, as will a lot of other people. of course if you did then we would have the same issue at your system, and we would be right back where we started.venkul mul doesn't agree with me, and that's fine, and he posted legitimate reasons why it wouldn't work as i originally described it and he was completely right as well. they were aspects that i hadn't thought of so i adjusted the idea, hopefully he will come back again and give some more reasons why it wouldn't work."
3/5/2009,"as per this discussionlinkagefor those of us that use drones as primary dps/support, i think we need a ""button(s)"" that we could assign different groups of drones to that would automatically deploy and send drones to the designated target. if i was using turrets or missiles, i just target and f1, etc. i'm not sure why i have to go through the menu of launching drones, then assigning the target. so basically i would like to see a button above the mods, that deploys drones and attacks target all in one."

3/5/2009,i like this suggestion. atm i don't really see any reason to use a cyclone since the hurricane does just about anything better (except active shield boost ). i was thinking of a change of shieldboostamount from 7.5 to 10% and more cpu before i saw this thread but i think your idea is better.
3/5/2009,"i really like the looks of the cyclone, even more than the cane <ducks from incoming vegetables> and i wish it was actually any good so i'd fly it and be pimp. i'm not sure on the shielboost bonus tbh, i'd rather have it get resists or shield amount and change it so it can passive tank decently for missions, while at the same tim giving passive defense for pvp. giving you more fitting options.and yes, it really does need more cpu and the high slot>midslot would also make sense. so i can't support the changes you propose but i do support the call for looking into it."
3/5/2009,are you kidding?cyclone with an xl booster is insane.you want even better a tank?how about unfit that oversized xl booster and go with a large. then you can fit.
3/5/2009,"i'm thinking this could be a beast coming from a faction like mordus who are ecm-happy.something similar in price and size and capability as a rorqual; relative to tank and ehp.costs fuel to run just as the rorqual does.what it does:lets say you are sieging your enemy's territory; you are more or less hold them hostage in their space; or they are just running like mad.you deploy this. -it cynojams the system so no capitals can come to the system.-it also jams up any capitals so they are unable to jump out.-it also puts the stargates in ""traffic advisory"" mode or whatever. where it takes up to 3 minutes to jump to the next system.other uses of this system:you deploy this.get your dreads on a pos shooting. they try to jump in 2 titans. nope no longer.they will have to come toe to toe with the subcap game."
3/5/2009,this could be a nasty abusive tool.cynojammers require sov to deploy.... unless i'm mistaken.while i'm all for the idea as it would make things interesting.... it may throw the balance a bit too far off.it would have to be a very expensive ship... .but expensive these days also means not so hard to obtain due to the easy nature of obtaining isk.in short.... good idea... but may not fare so well.i'll sit back and wait for others to comment.
3/5/2009,yummy.you are not mistaken. you require sov 3 infact.that's where qa and balancing comes in.also of note. they are planning a complete overhaul of the sov system. so in the new system. they could very well establish even better balance.ease of isk does not compute to materials. so naturally the materials are also an easy nature of obtaining.aka dont try to blame carebears for making people rich. the whole market has made people rich.srsly? lol. facepalm.gif

3/5/2009,"that seems a bit overpowered for a ship to be able to lock out an entire system. what about making a 2au diameter cyno jam field to inhibit the ability to hot drop caps on the field, so they have to warp in thus delaying their response time. given you will be able to see the caps forming on scanner will give you time to prepare, and the extra 30 seconds could save a lot of ships if you become heavily outnumbered."
3/5/2009,your pushing your luck... keep it up and any future ideas you come up with will be ignored 100% of the time.it's bad enough 99.9999% of your ideas are crap.... but being a smartass is even worse.

3/6/2009,"ok, i made different experiences as most people here, dunno why./not signed i dont know anything about missioning at all and yes maybe its worse than before. but, im ratting alot and doin exploration alot in 0.0, and i found out that ratting in my cerb is still faster than anyone would do in any hac, im killing the rats (even officer ones in venal) fast enough to have an outcome of 4-5 million every paycheck if i chain, and 3-4 million if i kill all spawns + the faction chance.im using t2 launchers ofcause + fury and precision missles at the appropriate targets. i found out a huge difference when switching to precision ones fom normal ones at killing destroyer and frig spawns. the other thing is for pvp u wont need much tank, its more for buffer and resistance. so what u do is to put the explosion sig radius rigs and the explosion velocity rigs on it and u will hit small targets just fine.u get the advantage of choosing the dmg type too, which, noone here mentioned, is very much helping at getting the target down easily. in pvp i as a cerb am not soloing, but in fleet or gang its a very good thing to have target painters with both skills on 4 on ur ship. ur really boosting the dmg for ur missles...anyways, i just wanted to make this clear to have the choice to go for rigs + choosing the dmg type will give ya the isk/time ratio back at ratting in belts."
3/6/2009,so you either didnt read or understand anything i said then oh and err... all the people youre helping (i mean thankgod for people like you) are just clueless noobies and youre far more superior then everyone else? would i be correct in assuming that? i need to ask you because im a clueless noob at life and especially general logic.

3/6/2009,"i've been playing around some naglfar fits on sisi, and i now agree that armor tank on naglar is a bad idea for damage output.it's like having 3/4 of a dread, for same price as others and longer training time.(i think armor tank can be good for pos bashing, if you're primary by pos, gives you more chances to survive, only it's tank is still subpar to other dreads)i thought about the term ccp has used for description as versatile.comparison:amarr: dread & carrier: armor tank - 1 weapon systemcaldari: dread & carrier: shield tank - 1 weapon systemgallente: dread & carrier: armor tank - 1 weapon systemminmatar: carrier - armor tank; dread - shield tank. - 2 weapon systemscapital shield booster - 27 daystactical shield manipulation v, shield operation v, capital shield operation vi - 27 days citadel - torpedoes 5, warhead upgrades iv, citadel torpedoes iv - 26 daysversatile costs minmatar capitals over 50 days of extra training time.armor tank = still subpar tank, 3/4 of damage output compared to other dreads.shield tank = more competitive damage, ok buffer tank, weak shield tank.forced split weapons system layout = not much advantage in terms of damage.to sum it up, i think all this versatility and extra training time, doesn't give much advantage to minmatar capitals at all.it doesn't even bring it equal to performance to other capitals."
3/6/2009,"one of the concerns about ""docking into player controlled ship"" ideas is that what happens, when a player thet carries other players disconnects or logs off? would the ship stay in space until everybody disembarks, perhaps delaying log-off aggro too? what if there's an afk pilot? or everybody would pop out into space when the carrier player disconnects?how would you solve this?"
3/6/2009,i like the ideas... but would there be a reversal of the limitations of what can be in the ship maint bays?or do i have eject any cans or cynofuel before i can get in?if that restriction gets changed? what would stop people from using carriers again to move goods and ships besides jumpfreighter? etc etc.i dont like the idea of nerfing jumpbridges. they are limited to sov 3. same with titans.. titans arent exactly cheap and disposable... despite what shrike thinks.i definately like the idea of boosting carrier-moms to do what they sort of are designed to do. right now it's a joke... just to get people into jumpfreighters.personally i'm more of the opinion ofboosting moms into a new role. such as being able to remote rep sieged things. like dreads for example.right now if you get into a big dread battle. if the dread is primary... they unsiege hoping they dont die and get repped by the carriers in order to mess up their targets.would be very cool to see moms there for more balance.as for titans. when bombs came out with the anti-cap sort of idea. i thought they would come out with something similar for titans. generic mod that all 4 titans can fit. 250km range anti-cap dd. just to give the option of dmg or anti-cap.heatwarfare should be left to be done right.
3/6/2009,player controlled ships get ejected... obviously this isn't an afk hiding place.
3/6/2009,"signed.if you did not take the adequate precautions and got your freighter into a situation where it will die, you should pay the price.as it is, people would rather do this, than use scouts or escorts, in order to move under war dec or through hostile territory with near impunity. we can beat this with tactics, but its ridiculous, and very much against the spirit of eve, imo.at the very least, increase the logout timer to 60 seconds. this would still save many, many discos, but would allow those that do it to cheat be punished."
3/6/2009,"supported.to clarify: i support extending the dissappear timer when a person is being aggressed.e.g. take these situations as an example as a pilot loses connection after jumping through a gate.1) he is not aggressed as his ship aligns and enters emergency warp, and is not aggressed once it is ""safe"". his ship dissappears 30 seconds from when his connection was lost.2) he is initially aggressed on the gate as he aligns for emergency warp, but his aggressors lack a warp scrambler or disruptor and he enters emergency warp regardless. his ship dissappears 30 seconds from the last time he was aggressed.3) he is aggressed, and tackled on the gate. his ship is now at the mercy of his aggressors.the same should be true for pilots that have been involved in aggression before logging off.1) player aggressors stop aggressing, and player logs off. he is not further aggressed and his ship dissappears after 15 minutes.2) players aggressors stop aggressing, and player logs off. he is scanned down and further aggressed. his ship is at the mercy of his aggressors.3) player loses connection in the middle of a fight. his ship is at the mercy of his aggressors.i think that's probably the best way of fixing it.you take a risk when you undock a ship, and while disconnects do happen, i think that's a risk people should be willing to accept."
3/6/2009,fix this!
3/6/2009,lrn2scramble?lrn2bubble?lrn2probe?so you didnt have him scramed or bubbled... and he could have warped anytime? lrn2scramble? or lulz stabbed carrier? lrn2hictor.impossible. you cannot warp if pointed by a hic.lrn2scamble?lrn2bubble?lrn2scamble?lrn2bubble?
3/6/2009,"raised it for next csm meeting, but due to the timing it won't be discussed with ccp (should it make it through the csm) until the 3rd meeting with them (may 10)"
3/6/2009,"a reasonable compromise, but they can still warp to ss, warp back, rep and repeat."
3/6/2009,"with the alteration that if they're tackled when attackers notice them flagged, they are much more likly to have to deal with the consequences."
3/6/2009,"i really agree with this idea, especially if we could select a field of choices and the repair window only displays those items that need repaired in there. i think this was mentioned before, but it would really help with my poor damaged drones if i could select the whole group and the window would display the one(s) that are damaged.i could see it being useful in a bunch of other ways too. for now, i think a supported is enough."
3/6/2009,"well with the goon leader darius johnson as csm leader or whatever, and if the csm brought this topic forward for it to be fixed it would be going against the goon goals and stuff.as long as their is a goon in the csm, the eve community will never get an unbiased representation."
3/6/2009,"... to the newbies...several of the default settings in a new users account are ... well, dangerous.1) autopilot has by default ""choose shorter"" which can lead new players into lowsec without their intention. i am all for pvp, but i prefer to be able to say my targets knew what they were doing and were not just on autopilot from hulm to ours.2) autotargeting is on by default. this leads to the possibility of a less-informed newbie being concorded from having his guns primed for his/her first mission.in my opinion, this is not good game design. let the poor newbies make conscious choices that will lead them into danger - do not make them for them. also, these are settings most of us know how to change after a short while, but it is bloody annoying that they are reset after each server crash/cache swipe/reinstall.tldr version:change autopilot to default to ""safer"" and change autotargeting to 0 targets back as default."
3/6/2009,oh god does this ever need to be implemented.it is hilarious to see autopilot ibis through low sec though.
3/6/2009,this will help new players without causing any harm that i can see.
3/6/2009,supported
3/6/2009,"yep, supported."
3/6/2009,"lets face it, moons are static, and the latest hopes at increase in supply from game development (aka, w-space moon seeds) has been shattered. growing player base = growing demand.static moons = no increase in supply.growing demand + static supply = never ending price increasethe latest attempt at fixing this problem was alchemy. alchemy was a epic failure to say the least. it very well could be rebalanced to work in favor, but in its current forum does little to help the ever growing problem. in short i'm asking the csm to try and push this a little higher on the agenda for ccp.edit: my proposal on what might work to help."
3/6/2009,"from what i remember we already discussed this with ccp. at least i remember talking to some ccp people about it at fanfest.however, alchemy is a price loft.the problem eventually comes down to supply and demand. i'm not sure we should mess with it too much. if a dynamic system is made, it will be farmable i think. that means t2 become more abundant. i'm not sure if that's always a really good thing."
3/6/2009,prices of t2 ships and modules hasn't been increasing steadily over the years like your post suggests. instead they have gone up and down more on speculation of lots of high end moons changing hands and supply being lower for a while.so i don't really see much of a problem at the moment. t2 ships and modules are relatively cheap still.being able to mine moon minerals via mining lasers is a terrible idea. thumbs way down.
3/6/2009,there used to be a day where hacs costed close to 200m and hulks upwards of 300m.and people still flew them....not supported.
3/6/2009,i disagree. alchemy is there and works great. the price that justifies the use of alchemy just isnt there; but people can do it anyway.on top of that... worst case scenario they do a patch just to adjust moons to create more nice moons.or even just allow mining in 0.4 to 1.0there are tons of options and ccp very well knows about it.
3/6/2009,even then. if hacs become too expensive again. people simply fly battleships and insurance becomes a factor also.so really...it's all supply and demand. if people use bs and not hacs. hacs prices go down.
3/6/2009,"so people are going to spend billions of isk and slave over pos work for a loss. sorry, thats not the way the system works and thus it is unbalanced and broken.i do not believe t2 should be 1000% more costly then t1, i do not believe that ccp intended for t2 to be so high, there first mistake was the t2 bpo lottery, second was the static moon mining system.i understand the idea of the eve sandbox and we make the game as we want it, but the counterargument can be made that the pos exploits as of late showed use that t2 could be cheaper if a new supply was added. i respectfully disagree on the point that you feel t2 should not be more abundance. if that was such a bad idea why did t2 production go from static to dynamic. and high end t2 minerals are already farmed, but only by a select power block alliances. this should not be the case."
3/6/2009,"actually this was hashed out in the market discussion forum quite a bit about the dynamics of current moon minerals. over the course of 8 months we had thread after thread (about 1 a week really) dicussing1. the increase in moon minerals and the inevitable high end to expect (the previously mentioned 200m hacs for instance)2. the then price trend down and then eventual crash, which coincided with the start of major exploiting well before it was publicly knew it (props to akita for pointing out that minerals were coming from somewhere)3. the prediction of the price increase and leveling point to june/aug 08 levels, which obviously has turned out trueright now there is no indications that prices will spike much higher. however we'll still of course have the occasional massive demand spikes, but those spikes all have a soft cap of price for the final goods and profitability of moons being diverted to external market vs used internal in whatever alliance happens to have that moon at the moment.prices also have the nice ability to adjust quickly thanks to invention as well, where as before it would take some time before bpo holders would shift price points up or down at times, instead riding the prices highs as long as sustainable.the system is working as intended, and about the only change that needs to be made at this point is a lower soft cap using alchemy, or disjoining the current alchemy reactions from specific racial ties in their r units."
3/6/2009,well the dics have been so sad since their bigger brother has come around.now while i still think being cloaked in a safespot somewhere should be godmode. but a cloaker who is spying on a gatecamp shouldnt necessarily be godmode. now there is the chance of getting bumped... but that is so unlikely.what decloaks you? clouds.i think dics should be able to drop a probe which explodes into a cloud. that is what? 5-10km ranged or so.the cloud obviously dissipates after say 5 mins or something.this in conjunction with bubbles and a big gatecamp might mean no holding of your cloak. i think that's a cool thing. :)this way people dont leave 100 wrecks and corpses at a gate just to attempt to decloak people.
3/6/2009,"it's an interesting theory but i don't believe interdictors should have this ability. if anything it should be a cloaking ship or an astrometrics ship that gets a 'cloud mine' to decloak ships. then again most ships that are designed to cloak can move pretty fast, even warp while cloaked or move faster while cloaked. so dodging or avoiding the cloud and re-entering at range would be easy enough. as i have a covop//stealth bomber alt i personally sit well over 20km from a gate that i'm watching. so any 5-10km decloak mine would be pretty much ineffective. while in a covop like a helios i'll literally sit 152 km off the gate and just swap my camera to the gate and then each ship as need permits. to be completely honest a nano hac, intie, or cloaked covop with a smartbomb is the only thing that i ever really need to worry about. especially if another covop has the smart bomb and start orbitting around cloaked."
3/6/2009,why not really? dics could use a little love. new role would be perfect.how come?that's the real balance now isnt it. that's why dic is best in my opinion.cov-op is understandable. warping cloaked lets you get there and you could be 500km away and watch things. stealth bombers and non-cov-op ships either have to setup before the gatecamp and sit there and do basically nothing. or they could get decloaked because they know u are there.lets say you have a bomber. he sits around a gatecamp waiting for nubs in indies coming around. he decloaks and fires 1 volley and kills them.. then cloaking right away. almost nobody gets him targeted.. but a dic can get right on him super quick. the cloudmine pops and is certain to decloak the guy.the whole decloak cloud is good for decloaking people who jump in.
3/6/2009,please stop posting.
3/6/2009,"so is transferring isk between character wallets, between corporate wallets and via the purchase of commodities on the market and the exchange of said commodities in a variety of ways - none of which i forsee being proscribed against any time soon on the basis they might be used for dirty in-game isk laundry."
3/6/2009,"i'm all against rmt.but this doesn't sound like rmt. if you think isk-sellers are going to be able to sell isk with a simple change in the way they word it, then you are wrong.if you think ccp will lend support to anyone who gets scammed in such a foolhardy way or that internet lawyers will get a legitimate case then you are wrong again.i believe the eula states something like, you cannot xfer, sell or auction anything ingame. when i read that i figure that loans and collateral is pretty much implied but if you want to get all huffy about it, sure throw in a few more words if it'll make you happy. ccp can ban this type of action, but hell. if i buy my friend a pizza and he gives me a 200m isk ""loan"" ingame, i'd like to see ccp track me down.throwing support, but you sound like chicken little, lvv."
3/6/2009,"while this is disheartening news, i don't think ccp is going to have any way to enforce it. as the rules stand, they can do the same that they would be able to do in game with any rules modifications. let's not forget that the eula states the following:while i would support this measure, i can't see that it would do any good. sorry, i don't think i can support this measure."
3/6/2009,"signed, because salvaging is like mining rocks which happen to be miles apart with a random chance of yielding something.that's fun right? *rolls eyes*make them need some kind of module which eats up cpu, or create a salvaging ship which has a bonus along the lines of 99% reduction in cpu needs for salvage drone modules."
3/6/2009,you do know that you didnt support it? here i'll do it for you.

3/6/2009,"i like the idea of a few pre-set scan ranges. i'd also like to be able to select those ranges, the scan degree arc, and activate a scan all with hot-keys."
3/6/2009,"yes please, some reworking of the scanner would be nice. sliders would be a good start!"
3/6/2009,this would be really handy.
3/6/2009,hotkeys for preset ranges and arcs would be golden
3/6/2009,"i'm surprised at the resistance to this. i can think of one good use for it. training. i mean those neanderthals of earth, 10,000 years prior to this whole new eden fiasco were using computer simulations for training.... :p"
3/6/2009,"well duh, the idea was pretty ******ed in the first place. eve is amout risk, once you start to implement carebear death - free arenas you will start eve on the road to its death. get rid of that idea for good!"
3/6/2009,"yes, because the dozen or so poses which we could imagine having scanners on them (and able to perform simple trilateration) would broadcast to the matching corps/alliances on an encrypted channel. it always makes me laugh when so-called pvpers whine about the state of affairs in the game when they are, really, sub par compared to what we have right here on earth, right now. in a game that is supposed to be 10,000 years in the future. of course it makes perfect sense that humans could master space-time so well as to fling fleets of massive starships hither and yon all without mastering the mathematics of simple location finding."
3/6/2009,"with local in delayed mode its simply not worth it anymore to rat, even in good systems."
3/6/2009,"the problem is with delayed 0.0 is that it makes the space super indefensible. you would need a small pvp gang just to protect people. while the agressors have the map which can see ""average pilots in space last 30mins"" or ""active pilots""the agressing fleet knows exactly what they are likely to come up against. directional scanners being weak because u can ditch ships in pos and the 14au max range covers very little usually.even then... if i'm ratting in 0.0... it's a pain already having to watch 0.0 quite a bit. if i have to spam directional scanners constantly instead? oh jeese.honestly 0.0 is hard enough on nubs. no reason to make it even more difficult."
3/6/2009,"it becomes more risky, but encourages the use of manual intel and scouts. it's also a black-ops buff."
3/6/2009,"if i have to use scouts to rat, i'm much better of doing lvl 4's in high sec. not to mention how easy it will be for cloakers to clean out ratters."
3/6/2009,"if you can stomach that kind of activity - sure. a large chunk of my isk comes from 0.0 rats, and i am all for delayed mode local in all 0.0 space. when someone comes in-system, there's no reason for them to know i'm already there. :)"
3/6/2009,"ratting is just as mindnumbingly boring as doing missions. the ones coming in system will be hunting ratters so they will look for you, and find you within 30 seconds."
3/6/2009,"which makes ratting less mind-numbingly boring, as you have to keep your scanner peeled for signs of incoming enemies.cloakers should have that kind of power, as to be honest most cloakers could be swatted by any real ratting ship - or at least driven off. boo-hoo you if you rat in a ship that sucks!"
3/6/2009,"pressing scan every 2 seconds is mindnumbingly boring, and an utterly ******ed mechanic.in that kind of situation i'd be happy to run around in my recons killing stuff, but i'd be stupid to try to rat to get isk in that kind of situation. it simply isnt worth it compared to doing lvl 4's."

3/7/2009,"several issuesadding in another gun to make the minnie bs class work simply demonstrates the class is fundamentally flawed.minnie fighting is about glass cannons. weak tanks, huge alpha and mobility.- the phoon is high dps/short range/non-autocannon boat that actually can tank. switch the shield hitpoints with the armor hitpoints and it will be fine. this has been an issue for years.- the tempest should become the fleet sniper (glass canon) with massive bowel-clenching alpha - low rate of fire and have a weak tank. the utility comes from having the two spare high slots to fit whatever floats your boat. drop the rof bonus and make it a 10% per level damage bonus and an 10% per level optimal bonus. the slot variation then allows you to choose 1400mm or 1200mm, full on gank or a bit of tank. the spare highs mean a remote rep ability or a nos ability. omg it has no tank. that's the price it pays for being the scary beast in fleet warfare. lifting the optimal also gives it some autocannon capabaility but the lack of a real tank is the weakness of this ship.- the maelstrom should be the terrifying pure autocannon wet dream. do not change the tank bonus or the rof bonus. make it the most agile and fastest bs. adjust the tracking of all minnie autocannons -> they should as a matter of race be the best anyway; not worse than amarr ffs.then you have three clear roles:- miassion running and ratting - short range armor tanking non-autocannon bs- scary pew pew sniper- scary pew pew close range gunboat.of course, perhaps one day minnie will get effective ewar but don't hold your breath on it.it is incredibly disappointing that minnie bs remain the worst and the whining of the amarr saw it become so clearly superior. this is a failure of game design.as for the blasterthrons; welcome to the minnie world."

3/7/2009,i don't agree. why should missiles be the only thing hitting for full damage. guns can't do it why should missiles.
3/7/2009,"you are an idiot. do you even play this game? go back to wow. if a freighter/any other ship jumps into a system and see's a giant camp all they have to do is ctrl q and all you have to do is have a large enough buffer to last circa 30 seconds before your ship disapears. so say the target is bubbled, infin-point and has 40 more points of scram on him his ship simply dissapears, poof gone. as long as they have not been shot before or not shot at any one before they ctrl q they dissapear. this is ccp's way of helping to protect the people that get randrom drops or have an unstable connection. at which point if your connection is untable use a damn scout ask a friend. again last night we had another hauler try this exact thing. too bad for him his mammoth did not have the tank for 10 bs plus support. ccp needs to stop being so damn nice it just facilitates the means to exploit."
3/7/2009,"once again, the problem is not being able to point, bubble, scram, whatever. the problem is this:if the player logs out before aggression has occured by being hit with a hostile module or by engaging in a hostile act, they vanish in 30 seconds regardless of any other conditions."

3/7/2009,"more1. display setup : interval one instead of interval immediate (i.e. vsync on), so advanced settings also enabled (some people actually experience damage to their video cards due to overheating, might want to prevent that from happening, also there's no point in having a fps higher than your display refresh rate anyway)2. general settings (general) : show session change timer (and make it actually display a timer, not a bloody rotating 5-pixel thingy... seriously, annoying as hell)3. overview defaults : sorted by distance, stargates on overview, cans/wrecks/debris/asteroids/billboards/stations off the overview, overview taller (at least fill the screen from below current target to the bottom on the lowest display resolution height)4. general settings (inflight) : auto target back - zero targets (it's one of the first things most people that have a clue do anyway, newbies are only inconvenienced by it, and only a handfull of vets actually can make a decent use of it)5. general settings (windows) : don't try to use existing info window. we really don't need the old info taken away by default, it's easier to close an opened window than pressing shift every time.6. shortcuts : add a lot of the existing commands with some default keypress combos, especially drone commands (for instance, f9 for attack, or anything else that makes sense). having some ""standardized"" keypresses for things people use a lot would only make sense.7. common (graphic) settings : cache size off (seriously, it doesn't help that much at all to have it any larger, if you want, you can make it larger later)."
3/7/2009,i almost got caught out by the fact that drones are set to aggressive by default. i have been advised to set them to passive.
3/7/2009,"wholeheartedly supported.setting up new people without the slightest bit of experience to make dangerous mistakes is really unconscionable. it's a lame ""gotcha!"". i tell all the newbies i meet: ""have you set your autopilot not to fly through lowsec?"". i'm sure there are those who believe i'm trying to trick them into something until they see the actual line in the autopilot tab.let the newbies acclimatise for a while. when they know enough to make their own decision they should absolutely bear the consequence. can we just not do that in the first hour they're here though, when they don't know where they are, where they're going, what they're doing, what all the knoepfkens and blinkenlights are for?devil's advocate argument: getting podded in your first hour of being in new eden is your clear sign that you're not in my friendly pony land. in this place you pay attention or you pay the price. ignorance is not an excuse. i actually like that argument quite a bit myself. eve is not for everyone. i see newbie frigates abandoned outside of stations when people decided they didn't need this hassle. fair enough. life in new eden is not for the ""give me a hand out"" crowd. it is very much the mindset of ""i don't ask for what i want, i -take- what i want"". having said that, the autopilot should not default to the riskier choice when the newbie can decide on their own they want to fly through lowsec. autotargetting a ship and not knowing how to turn it off and risk being blown up by concord is just stupid. these are decisions to be made by experienced capsuleers, not by people still trying to find their way around the interface, never mind the game universe and the strange bestiary of predators it harbours.abulurd bonifaceme meceo"

3/7/2009,"have an enemies list and a long and vengeful memory. i will pay some visits to my ""budies"" soon.just spreading the love."
3/7/2009,at least we can agree that alchemy in its current forum needs rebalencing or disjoining of some kind.
3/7/2009,"if you've ever lived in curse you see interdictors do plenty fine. i'd love to see some interdictor pilots who like to use it as a small solo pvp ship come in and give some input.a possible better, more amusing, and game improving suggestion is swapping out defender missiles for a decloak missile. yes you heard me a decloak missile.have a missile that generates a 1-5 km field around. fire it off what used to be a defender missile. cloaked ships can only get so close to something before decloaking. now you have a chance to fly around the gate launching these possibly cheap missiles every which way. while i just came up with that on the fly it would be way more useful then the current defender missiles are !"
3/7/2009,"i agree that this is happening and its detrimental to the game. it allows people that dont abide by the rules of the game to achieve wealth without due diligence thus cheapening the achievements of true players that play by the rules.this should be easy enough to enforce by implimenting a few curency transfer rules. the amount/value specifications of these rules might be adjusted a bit to encompass most scenarios.1) isk transfers/sales cannot be made more than 100% above median price of goods sold that are above 10,000,000.00 unless players are older than 6 months.2) isk/goods cannot be gifted in quantties above or add up to 1,000,000isk or in value, within a 1 month time frame, by players how's account is not at least 6 months old.3)any account that is found attempting to solicit rl curency for a n in-game profit will be deleted and the ip and cc will be blocked from game. 4)any one that turns in an account that is found to be engaged in soliciting rl currency for in-game profit will acquire 50% of the offending account's isk value.these rules will destroy the rl currency funding of players that dont want to earn there place in the game by the rules."
3/7/2009,"ok now before we ever see this kind of list again lets first sit back. when we first started playing eve. it was tough, it was complex, and lets face it we were all pretty broke unless we had a buddy comping us. i myself easily blow 100mil on newbies in skill books + items and ships. being a newer player is tough enough without some 6 month barrier. they are paying customers and thus should be treated as such. not to mention it guts alts.so onto the list1 - 6 month barrier issue // scamming is part of eve pay attention when you buy something2 - basically makes alts and supporting friends that you talked into trying the game impossible or more hassel then it's worth... also just no3 - i think a ban and the subsquent purchase of a new acct by the offender is much better in ccp's interests. repeat offenders may get the whole ip ban but i'm not sure how ccp handles this or would handle it. i've never been banned.4 - no, because then we have false reports... what happens if i report you for rmt and i may be lying but i managed to provide some evidence? do you get half of my stuff? do you get banned because of extremists measures like the ones you listed and i get half your stuff? can alliances like goonswarm completely annihilate the other alliances by spamming rmt trading on red alliances? i mean out of 5000 people suppose the penalty for multiple false reports is banning. they could easily lose 1000+ alt accts that we all know they have. most eve players have alts after all.edit: fixed a phrase in #4"
3/7/2009,"i'm confused and haven't looked into how much rl money isk goes for on ebay or something but don't plex's scale comparably with that?also, with the plex's you can use out of game assets (money in your bank account) to literally buy isk.i guess in the end, it does take money out of ccp's pocket because it encourages macro mining, but so does the ability to pay for your account with in game money.i think in the end that it is really hard to say whether selling isk/loaning large sums without any true in-game collateral is really all that bad considering that ccp has provided the tools to rip themselves off (lol).but in all seriousness i think it can be unanimously agreed that macro-mining is bad, and it is truly the source of all this evil. sadly i don't think that any of the suggestions to defeat the cursed macros are feasible and so i think that until they are dealt with selling isk will continue.p.s. the pizza comparison is perfect!"
3/7/2009,"this topic isn't about macro mining at all. the topic being discussed is whether ccp should consider specifically amending the eula to proscribe against the loaning of isk between players when rl currency, a promise of a meal at mcdonalds, etc are offered and accepted as securities.furthermore, gtcs/etcs and the consequent plex items are not ""tools to rip ccp off"", as you seem to imply but rather they provide ccp with increased revenue in addition to game subscriptions.i'm now going to take the opportunity to repost the official response garnered in the thread which precipitated this one."
3/7/2009,"imho, no where does this statement says that the activity is allowed or that it is a loophole. essentially, any and all remedial actions available to ccp in such matters is limited to items and services provided by ccp. they can not, legally, interfere in any transactions that did not happen across their network, applications, or any other property of belonging to them. virtual or real.however to take this statement of fact as some sort of ""permission"" to engage in the activity is foolhardy in the extreme. not to mention an obvious failing in reading comprehension.like i've said before, why this is being allowed to be discussed is beyond me as it is very simple. person a hands person b isk. person b hands person a cash. at this point we have a transaction. just because both parties agreed to the same rate of exchange at some possible future point doesn't change the fact that cash and isk has changed hands.the only reason this is a big stink, over in the md, is because ebank is tangentially connected to all of this. of course using the ebank banking system creates an rmt laundering system that is apparently being used by it's primary founder. after all, ric can just transfer isk (after receipt of cash) to an ebank account and some unsuspecting and honest teller simply handles the ensuing ""standard"" withdrawal request. voila, rmt is laundered.now, this may seem like an irresponsible accusation and something not worth bothering with. imho ric should have just never said anything. however he's flaunted that he does this. he's flaunted that it is successful and that ccp can look at all of his accounts and find nothing untoward. primarily, i just think he's stupid for coming here and thumbing ccp's nose about the whole matter when silence would serve him, and his customers, much much better.for myself, i've recently withdrawn my isk from ebank. all of it. i want to have nothing to do with the potential fall out as this whole mess simply plays to damn close to ban-hammering. last thing i want to do is spend two weeks pleading, via email, to get my account back because someone else can't color inside the lines."
3/7/2009,"btw i think we should point out that blurring the lines between virtual property and physical property has brought detriment to many. no matter how stupid the people involved are allow the lines to blur permits, even fosters, greater and greater stupidity.case in point: chinese murder over weapon.furthermore, considering how stupid (and brutal) some of our fellows get i'm sure that if we allow real life mortgages over virtual property that some defaults may result in this and this.ps: mind you the above is rather hilarious i'm sure you all know someone in eve that would be stupid enough to borrow isk and someone brutal enough to hunt that person down. last thing we, or ccp, needs is this kind of publicity should the unspeakable, but likely, happen."
3/7/2009,"just to clarify here. please check the other thread. it is quite clearly stated that this has not been done on any level with ebank and only me personally in the past helping out others ingame.but nice try shar, keep up the good effort."
3/7/2009,"at no point have i tried to represent the quoted repsonse as permission. i've only used it to reiterate the position of ccp, as you've put it more extensively: that they cannot interfere in any transactions that did not happen across their network, applications, or any other property of belonging to them and that any and all remedial actions available to ccp in such matters is limited to items and services provided by ccp. and if a tree falls in the forrest but nobody is present there to observe it, did it really happen?i'm sorry, but in my mind it really isn't the same thing. rmt is the exchanged of in-game isk for rl currency and the exchange is final. just because rl currency may change hands in the outlined scenario doesn't make it rmt. the rl currency is (if at all) only being used to leverage the loan where a loan may otherwise not be possible. that is the point of using it as a security deposit. the exchange isn't considered to be permanent unless the loan defaults and if the loan defaults then i think for all practical purposes the tree fell in the forrest and the (at minimum) only two people there to observe it happen will probably behave like a monkey - in the see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil sense - rather than fling their waste at each other until the zoo keeper deals with them both.tangentially. ebank is tangentially connected to the discussion because of ricdic - one of the employees. you're connected to what i am aware to be their only significant competitor, also as an employee yourself.as for the rest of your post ...shar, i consider you and ricdic both to be like a toilet that doesn't flush quite right or a stair that always creaks - fixtures that make home like home. at least in md, that is.that doesn't stop me wishing sometimes that i could take a hammer to you both for a little diy improvement"
3/7/2009,so if no one sees you breaking a law you then did not break a law? how un-karmic a thought. what you do when no one is watching you says much of one's character.that's the end of what i have to say.
3/7/2009,"on the flip side, they'd probably be upset if i **********d in front of them."
3/7/2009,i'm sorry but what was the point of this thread again?
3/7/2009,"if you look hard enough, you'll see it at the top of the page."
3/7/2009,oh... because for a while there it looked like a coad thread.
3/7/2009,rmt = real money trading [transaction] - to complete a transaction in which real world currency is used.^ that is the real definition. any transaction in which real world currency is used. whether this was a term coined by players or ccp affects exactly what impact this has on the eula as i am to lazy to go read it right now to hunt for the term. there are a few things about this topic i think people are overlooking. sure due to the possible abuse of this system it should be highly regulated. i'm sure ccp does not relish the thought that if a loophole does exist that isk sellers can now run rampant. however it has always been ccps own stance that the players create standards and regulate themselves. clearly the majority of players don't approve of this form of rmt which can be used in legitimate circumstances due to the more common talked ill uses. however if ccp indeed will not touch this matter as i believe they won't [because i believe they are smart enough to realize that trying to extend their reach into this manner is merely symbolic and will not actually affect anything] then it is up to us the players to enforce standards onto this new form of trading.there are some really simple ways of creating rough standards//regulations for this type of trade. have respectable people only use trusted banks of eve. such banks should never allow someone who has defaulted on a loan to keep taking out loans time after time. clearly this will kill isk/selling in the sense of respect banks participating in it. a simple audit could confirm that they have been sending large quantities of isk to people who have defaulted on their loans. also those same 'respectable' people being those who own ipo's and the like can be confirmed to only accept 'lisenced' loans. on the other side you have those sneaky folk writing bad home loans an that will be our non respectable side of rmt loaning.the fact ccp hasn't commented leads me to believe that they're using this as some type of sting operation to catch people willing to admit on the forums. or that they have no intention of making any immediate changes to the eula to address this loophole. [or they'll make the change on march 10th and sneak it in with the expansion then start busting people hehe]
3/7/2009,"so if i understand the scenario being mooted as correct ""person a lends person b 1 billion isk, person b gives person a real life monies as security until said isk is paid back""?that being the case it's simply a form of real money transfer and real money should have nothing to do with eve (against plex sales too btw but thats another topic), i guess some would say that it doesn't become a rmt transfer unless someone decides to default on said loan but to my mind i would have to say thats pure sophistry at it's worst.so yeah clarification from ccp on the matter would be good."
3/7/2009,"i knew what rmt is/was.i was just commenting on the obvious corp kicking that was going on.rmt in eve is a nasty can of worms.personally i tend to take the stance of ""its your money and your head, feel free to lose both if you want""rmt is a stupid move... you have no legal recourse or protection to prevent scamming to the 10th degree... compounded with the fact your dealing with international players.the only time i'll condone such things in my corp.... is if its done via ccp.and no where else... otherwise i will be the first to point and laugh at how foolish you are... if not have you removed for stupidity... as in some cases it causes more trouble than its worth.rmt should be strictly forbidden.... and only done through ccp sanctioned channels.period.as for how when where proof wise.... thats entirely up to the powers that be.people buy and sell isk all the time... tracking it can be difficult... that or its already being done and we just don't know of it.ccp's silence on the matter is going to be obvious.they can't stop it... but they will punish those foolish enough to further it.keep in mind that even ccp answers to international law... so they are probially going to take a nuetural stance as much as possible and keep the rmt to a minimum if at all possible.rmt is a real thing.... its everywhere...and it will happen.so don't give any of us that ""if a tree falls an no one hears it does that mean it happened?"" crap.because your just lying to yourself. you might as well play eve blind folded and with ear plugs at that rate.it starts with the players who think cheating by spending money to get isk and other rmt transactions is the way to go.hell even i question character buying.... as great as it is to have a member who bought a carrier pilot in our corp... i can't help but feel just a wee bit jealous and slightly ganked over the fact he went from battleship pilot to carrier in just a few well spent dollars.some of us put a lot of time into training and have issues with shortcuts.but i keep my mouth shut on that... it's his money... if he wants to spend it... so be it.but ethically speaking... there's something wrong with that picture.just how far is too far?what's next.... trading ships for cash?someone needs to draw the line...and quite clearly.again.. it all comes down to the player... the player needs to be told you will not and can not do this.and they get told... and they ignore... and they do it anyway.and they end up screwed over.... quite frequently.there are no cerdentials.... no security checks... its all on word of mouth.its your own damn fault if you don't think it through.so i don't think any amount of rules will help because this is not something you can control.your better off tracking disconnections vs. logging off."
3/7/2009,go back to the fanfest 2008 videos with the gm's playing with their rubic's cubes. one of them said they had made salvage drones but they didnt work right so they took them out. he alluded to the problem being drones not having the cargo space so your salvage would go poof even if they did salvage something.
3/7/2009,1) add a tick box for not showing contracts from blocked characters.2) add a filter for characters age to contract filtering (and a tick box for enabling it). that way you can ignore contracts from characters younger then xx days when looking for high value stuff. (gets rid of most scam contracts)3) add a local chat filter for showing any and all posts and/or posts with links from characters younger then xx days (i'd say a 10 day setting would get rid of most of isk spammers and bogus contracts in local)i believe when using this you can filter out 90% of scams in jita.you could miss out on a legit deal that way but it is your option to turn the filter on.if anyone can improve on the idea please go for it. point out any negatives as well. i might have missed something :)

3/7/2009,"essentially, i've become annoyed that low level non-cosmos pve encounters such as the ded complexes allow the entry of tech i small ships and tech ii small ships. my particular focus here is on the caldari 2/10 ded complexes (pith merchant depot) but i feel my arguments apply to all the non-cosmos 1 and 2 level ded deadspace complexes.tech ii ships, namely assault frigates, interdictors and (to a lesser extent) interceptors have obvious advantages over tech i ships in the same ship classes. the primary advantage in this scenario being their greatly increased resists allowing them to permanently tank a whole room of npc aggression without difficulty and especially without risk ...pilots of tech i ships will usually find these complexes challenging, often needing to carefully manage the npc aggression present in order to survive - before they even get to the last room! they are by no means a cake walk to complete. meanwhile, a tech ii frigate or destroyer will find them quite easy to complete with almost no risk to their ship at all. i feel this is unbalanced, giving pilots of these ships what amounts to be an unfair advantage over anyone else attempting the complex in a tech i frigate or destroyer.more importantly, for tech ii pilots in this scenario, there is comparatively no element of risk for reward present.these complexes only respawn after several hours and can drop approximately fifty million isk of loot (example: pithi b-type small shield booster) at a time and that kind of isk would be a real boon to a new player who expends the effort to earn it. unfortunately, these complexes are often found to be heavily/regularly farmed by much older characters in the above mentioned tech ii ships. whether some of these do it to generate isk for rmt is open to debate, i'm sure many players have heard rumors about this or seen suspicious activity themselves - i'm not delving into that aspect of the issue here.my concern is that we have a part of the game which provides an excellent potential source of income the new players being sabotaged by more than the usual amount of greed we put up with and exercise ourselves.i think there are a few solutions available but i think the most obvious (and best) one is the removal of assault frigates, interdictors and interceptors from the accepted ships list on the non-cosmos 1 and 2/10 ded deadspace complex accelerator gates. an alternative i will also raise is to introduce a timer lock-out function on the entry accelerator gate that restricts players from entering the complex for an arbitrary time (at least days) after their last attempt."
3/7/2009,"eve players age like fine wine. we become more complex, strong, and even change coloring. sorta like the difference between t2 and t1. by virtue of the t2 / t1 ship issue i suppose an older player able to fit all t2 items including t2 rigs onto his ship should be limited to t1?"
3/7/2009,"i really fail to see the issue here. to me, it sounds like your complaining that because people have better skills, they can earn isk easily. isn't that the point? i mean, next your going to say that hulks shouldn't mine in high-sec because there is no risk. or that marauders shouldn't be able to do lvl 4s because of all the isk they make. or that hacs shouldn't be able to rat because its too easy for them and there is little risk involved. i'm sorry, but unless i see a true reason other than ""its too easy for them"" i don't see the need to nerf non-cosmos encounters. --isaac"

3/7/2009,and the prize to the winner of this thread goes to...
3/7/2009,"on a posting spree today it seems. i think the ccp panel got it right during the q/a at fanfest. this isn't wow, anyone who equates the possible new tournament arena's to that obviously hasn't played eve. if anything i have faith the dev team would fire anyone who suggested a battleground-isque feature in eve. with that in mind this could possibly be part of the tool set they were developing to help run the alliance tournament? if that is the case then clearly alliances could hold mini-tournaments internally or any amount of tournament // grudge matches etc etc could come about. not to mention we'd be able to bet on the outcome. now imagine we can bet a ship...how about the ship we get virtually in the arena. someone gets to blow up a 'fake' ship and gets i don't know your real kronos for winning the bet. sounds like pirates will quickly become highstakes gamblers much like underground racers who put up the title of their cars. [on a side note what if you need to own the ship 'in eve reality' to use it in the simulation, and subsquently lose it in the bet?]edit: fixed it to your real kronos"
3/7/2009,"i really disagree with implementing some sort of ""arena"" combat into eve, but what about a contract system to engage in consensual combat?there could be all sorts of conditions placed in the contract as to the terms of the battle. things that come to mind are public/private, number of players involved, meeting point, and items to be wagered.there could be many more options to select in the contract, but you could set them up with extremely minimal restrictions as well so as to not feel stifled.also potentially you could have the choice to rank the fight or not. if you're just messing around then set up the contract for non-ranked or never accept one that is ranked.now i realize that this might open a floodgate of suicide gankers, so mitigating that would be difficult, but would it really be that terrible for something like this to occur? i don't really know how this would work out so please no flame but definitely open up some criticism on this one because i think a contract battle system might be interesting."

3/7/2009,"i am indeed (at least, i can't see anything stopping me sir) :)if that was the case, it would be ****ty indeed."
3/7/2009,"so in short then it seems i need to write up a detailed well thought out post covering the points re caod that have been raised within multiple threads in various differant forum threads, written in such a way that the csm knows exactly what the issues are so that csm can then raise the issue to ccp formally and await and/or discuss the response?if that is the case ill try but surely that the job of the csm, i know a lot of the posts titles are stating issues that cant be discussed but reading through the replys to these a no' of constructive well thought out ideas have come to light, surely a csm can look at the generality of the discussions and pick out the common theme and raise that?"
3/7/2009,"unfortunately we can't - they do need a formal vote thread in assembly hall. so yes, you do need to right it out."
3/8/2009,"/signednot only would this make them look much better, it would add a lot of realism."

3/8/2009,"first of all id like to apologise to the community for 'yet' another topic re caod but as far as i can understand the csm's refuse to acknowlege the issue unless its put forward in a undisclosed way lol(quote from omberzombie 'unfortunately we can't - they do need a formal vote thread in assembly hall. so yes, you do need to right it out.')there has been a no of threads re this the main one being;"
3/8/2009,"if you really want a ceo only forum as well, it can't hurt, though i guarantee it will be full of anodyne and worthless hurf blurf. tbh, the old intergalactic summit forum was as good as this sort of thing will ever get.but honestly, caod has always been worthless, and it always will be, goons and internet are just open and honest about this.jade is just upset because jade is actually really good at trolling via posts that leverage jade's lack of understanding of 0.0. now caod is exposed as a joke, it isn't as much fun for that type of trolling."
3/8/2009,"posting bans on a corp/alliance level is an excellent idea. also, only allowing directors/ceos is another way to go.i support this but i think these restrictions are a little too harsh. i like caod, and find some of the trolling to be funny, i'll admit to that. i would love to see which forums are the most viewed, i would expect it to be gd followed closely by caod and how can you say such a popular forum needs fixing?i would love a little bit of cleaning, but if caod was just neutral battle reports, i'd zzzz and go look up some pron."
3/8/2009,just dont read it. it seems that ccp and the players prefer to keep it as a place for trolls to have their fun so they dont ruin the rest of the forums.
3/8/2009,make it worth reading which probably will require large scale banning or posting restrictions. otherwise might as well delete the whole section and save the mods time
3/8/2009,"since there is an actual topic to discuss in this proposal, it's perfectly valid in it's current form.as for jade's suggestions - i personally like the requesting to post bit combined with the organisational moderation. or mods could start banning people again.yes, this is a topic that continues to raise it's head, but as i have told you in another thread already, every time we raise issues to do with moderation or the forums in general we get told not to. i'm happy to raise this if it gets some support, but don't be surprised if nothing comes of it."

3/8/2009,"would be rude not to support this topic. ultimately i think most non caod-spamming players recognize that something has gone horribly wrong with the corporate and alliance discussion forum and since player-led politics and wars are a key selling point of eve online its getting ridiculous that the virtual storefront for this gameplay appeal has been systematically sabotaged and rendered near completely unusable for anybody outside a certain 0.0 powerblock.certain players are currently abusing the intentions of that forum by creating disposable alts in an existing 0.0 entity simply to insult other players and post pointless drivel and meaningless spam in increasing volume. this has been going on for months now and it really needs to stop.in the op neresky quotes a proposal i made for dealing with this problem and its worth pointing out that i actually tried to gain consensus in this direction during my own six month csm term but failed due to at least 2-3 of the other csm's being affilitated with the very people conducting the endless spam campaign.it may well be that the current csm will be unable to reach consensus either - but its important that the effort is made and those csm members who do see the importance of caod as a window into the player-led politics of the game take a stand and present strong advise to ccp that this situation really needs to be cleaned up.personally-speaking i still believe the ""application for posting rights on caod/collective bans for organizations abusing that right"" is the way to go here since it will immediately disbar those entities that consider caod a dumping ground for their one-liners and puerile spam and prevent the endless cycle of disposable alts being used to flame and troll and insult other forum users almost entirely without consequence.i certainly believe there are many many interesting events, conflicts, campaigns and political struggles going on across the single server of eve online and it is close to a tragedy that all of this is currently 100% occluded by the destructive spamming and personal-attacks of one particular enity and power-block.so with that. supporting the motion!"

3/8/2009,"protip, control + a in the repair window selects everything for repair.good idea though."
3/8/2009,great idea. supported.(first time poster in csm forums)
3/8/2009,you are suggesting that the eve forums be made functional.
3/8/2009,a director can kick a player out of the corp.an alliance director can kick a corp out of the alliance.a director cannot overrule the ceo without the issue being voted upon by shareholders of the corp.an alliance director cannot overrule the ceo without the issue being voted upon by shareholders of the executor corp.a director cannot disband a corp because he cannot overrule the ceo.an alliance director can disband an alliance even when he cannot overrule the ceo.how's that for a flipping failure of an oversight?
3/8/2009,"the problem with all of this is that you'd have to apply the same level of control to booting individual corps.which sounds all well and good, until you find one of your corps goes ****-'alliance' but you can't get them out for 24 hours."
3/8/2009,"also, all 'disbanding' the alliance actually does is reset sovereignty to level 1 for a few weeks.you lose cynojammers, jump bridges, and invulnerable stations is sov 4 systems. that is all.all you lose is certain aspects of your defender's advantage for a few weeks.the invading alliances still have to beat you on your own turf, you still have all your pos defences, and all your outposts, and all your allies.haargoth didn't dissolve 1000s of player's effort. losing fleet fights with a reduced defender's advantage did that."
3/8/2009,"i find it very amusing that every single goon cling to a supposed victory by utilizing an obvious oversight from ccp. before this following sentence, i've never said one single word about bob and goon and how haargoth disbanded bob in 30seconds dissolving thousands of players' effort over the years.all i did was raising a valid point of argument by comparing the one single difference that lead to this discussion between corp-level director and alliance-level director. attempting to counter the argument with such feeble effort is self-serving and egocentric, but who am i kidding? you're a goon.the mittani has the power to walk off with 5000-odds goons' effort at this very particular moment. and god knows he would, he doesn't practice ""space bushido."" the question is, should he be allowed to?""all is fine and dandy."" that's the same mentality that brought down bob. you are only spelling your own downfall by refusing to let the flaw(s) in the system be rectified properly.also, please edit your post to english if and when you find the need to make sense."
3/8/2009,"yeah, i really don't think anyone was responding to your posts.the op's point would be fair enough if not for the problem that you can't put restrictions in without putting in the same restrictions on removal of individual corps (that is what happened to former-bob, there is no 'disband alliance' function).and not for the fact that it doesn't do as much damage as people seem to think it does.your point is just pendantic rules lawyering that i don't think anyone really gives a **** about.one simple thing that could be done, would be to allow alliances to exist with only one corp left in them.bob would have kept their name and it would have been clearer to empire dwellers that all that happened was that cynojammers and jumpbridges were disabled."
3/8/2009,have to support this even though i laughed for hours the day i started and one of my friends got podded close to a dozen times trying to get to where the rest of us were. (wow guildies who all started a trial on the same day.. i only went back to wow long enough to give my stuff away)
3/8/2009,have star gates on the overview by default as well
3/8/2009,"the entire ship should be setup like the theroetical eve universe civillian, ie - no lowsec routes, - stargates on overview,- no autotarget,- automatically everything on overview (ore, cans, debris)- better warning about canflipping, (they will shoot you for this)why not?- why no kb padded with ibis?- noob pewpew is lolz?- sometimes you just die. pay attention to your route and surroundings. - hello kitty online?"
3/8/2009,"dear csm,some time ago the devs put out a feedback thread on the features and idea fourm of using fuel pellets. basically it allowed folks to take all current fuels and smash them together to make a compact and less of a hassel fuel format that would require only 3 fuels, the charter, the pellets, and the isotopes for the racial fuel.the topic soon stopped getting responses from the devs and more recenlty lost its sticky status.overall most of us thought it was a good idea,the major complaint was build times. the issue is not keep this topic alive but to possibly impliment the fuel pellets, for the longest time star base operator need pos improvements and this is just a small step in improving the lives of all who run pos's and a possible boon to industry.thread is located herepos fuel pelletspleasebring this up to the attention of the devs again in hopes we can get this in finally."
3/8/2009,yeah!
3/8/2009,yeah good idea
3/8/2009,"or rather whats with npc's selling minuscule amounts of fuel at one time? ( stupid enriched uranium) if the damn guys would just sell me 1k units i wouldnt have to hit the buy 16 units a million time, fuel pellets..... hmmm.. yes, let someone else make it easy for me? i like it."
3/8/2009,yes fuel pellets are needed imo if a good balance in production time is found.bring this topic back to attention!
3/8/2009,"after being informed about details on the pos pellet idea, i now find myself in support of this concept. i'm sure ccp is looking at it, but a bit of info isn't that bad to have as to the progress."
3/8/2009,"yup, i'm really curious about why this idea died, it seemed like a good one. no, the pellets would only include isotopes and the npc goods. ozone and water are separate, and would remain so under the proposed system. also, while i don't mine ice myself, the refine charts i've seen say that ozone is available in all four highsec ices, merely in low quantities(25/unit)."
3/8/2009,"oh my! scan down a mission runner in lowsec.. warp in.. drop distress beacon.. cloak.. after the ensueing slaughter, salvage the battlefieldwith my luck.. would happen to me!would still flippin' funny though i think it would work better as a physical beacon that shows up on the overview and requires the use of repair facilities before you can launch another"
3/8/2009,"maybe make it so it can only be issued when the attacker has a criminal flag in empire and can be linked in other channels, i.e. corp or intel channels.rather than use a bookmark you can use a system similar to corp fleet invites, to broadcast it in a channel."
3/8/2009,sounds like lolz for all
3/8/2009,"this.. its not like the buddy list lets you set destination or anything... hey, now theres an idea.. modified buddy mechanics that allow you to request ""friend"" status to someone that you add.. if they allow it then be able to set destination to them at any time when they are on.. as set destination only gets you to the same system its not gonna be like a modified fleet thing."
3/8/2009,"alright, so i've made a thread like this before but i'm going to refine it and narrow it down. we've all seen the cool trailers where ships are flying in formation, but in reality fleet fights are two clusters of ships orbiting around each other - real ugly. some may say that this is a fluff, but i think this will make fleet fights much more interesting and will require more strategy.fleet formations.-in the tactical overlay, give the commander a way to move other players ship in game to his set up.-instead of a circle, the tactical overlay will be a cubed-grid. in the cubed-grid idea, you can also ""upload"" bookmarks to your fellow pilots. you set a point in space for them to move to, and also be able to set a point that they will align to.-in the cubed-grid, you will be able to see the intersecting lines point names. (example: a-57 / l22) a = altitude l = latitude etc.saving formation settings-automatically moves everyone in your fleet to their previous set up.-fleet formations can be made on an in-game tool before the fight. that way you always have a plan prepared.synchronized warping in formation option-makes all ships align to warp designation and slow their warp speed to match the slowest ship in the fleet."
3/8/2009,"wow really nice idea me, i think that fleet formations will involve much more strategy in this game making it like chess sort of.you have my support!"
3/8/2009,"nice for prewarp setup, but during actual battles, no, very much no. warping in with your very nice battle formation may look really cool, (and it does) fighting in formation? no, each ship needs the ability to move around a lot, thats why when you see dogfights (top gun, memphis belle, tora tora tora) the planes do a single dive then break into pairs. (for individual mobility)as real planes dont have the actual ability to rep each other, blobs dont happen. fleet fights devolve into blobs because of this, i like the idea, but its actual execution is fairly pointless,i would like a way to structure your fleets in space but it really really is a useless feature since this game is not line of sight, it doesnt matter to that laser aimed at the logistics, that the mega is in the way. and it doesnt matter that your own ships are between you and them for your missiles.when that changes then real formations will be needed, but as a look really pretty tool sure, you will see many more eve universe videos on youtube. and they will be epic."
3/8/2009,"i see no reason why anyone would ever use this ""feature"", given that it would actively make your fleet worse in combat(screwing up ranges, etc.), and i definitely see no reason why any dev should spend time on implementing it. not supported."
3/8/2009,"structed to warp in, but then they are allowed to break off and move of course."
3/8/2009,"your buddy should be the one bringing this forward -not yourself. i agree with the ninja about the petition option. (i wonder... is this the result of unchecked ninja activities... -ninjas gone bad? -so much for the apocrypha revamped noob experience.)if a player is participating in empire sanctioned activities -such as running missions, and another player interferes, there should be some consequence (i.e. balancing). at a minimum, the interfering partie(s) should lose standings with the corporation who's agent assigned the mission, with the agent themselves, with the mission runner's corporation, and possibly even concord. edit... the ninja bumpers should be given something as a reward/incentive -i suggest improved standings with the mission faction whom they assisted -so long as they didn't kill them off in the mission field.there is a place where such interference does not warrant consequence. that place is called null sec.an empire is no empire without law and order."
3/8/2009,"agreed, right now the current mechanic which ties it to cadmium is rather backwoods and really only ensures that the high end cap is higher than normal since cad is used in other much needed reactions.it would have been much more ingenious to tie the alchemy reaction to a combination of the r8's and r32's rather than the r16's."
3/8/2009,"i see ccp projected price of t3 as a way to control this and vice versa.t3 cruiser projected price is on the same level of hac price. moon minerals go too high, hac are substituted by t3 cruiser and demand is reduced, price go down, t2 demand increase and t3 demand decrease. it all depend how fast t3 can enter in production, but it can be an interesting mechanic. two different items with different production systems competing for the same market."
3/8/2009,"interesting concept, i support at least looking into it."
3/8/2009,how do you propose to boost recon ships and cov-ops ships after this is released (which it wont be).
3/8/2009,"personally i think that you are expanding too much out of what was actually said in that thread.basicly the way i understand that is that if to people who actually know each other personally in real life work out some sort of deal to loan isk to each other, ccp won't get involved. if you owe your friend 20 bucks, ccp doesn't care, nor do they care if he owes you 1b isk. there is no real reason why true friends can't ""lend"" (or just give) each other whatever in-game and out-of-game items they want.ccp isn't going to turn a blind eye to rmt transactions just because someone comes up some fancy story about how they were just ""giving"" isk to a friend. ccp has limited resourses to prove that real money was traded between people out-of-game, and they have even less ability to prove that the transaction was related to an isk transfer. obviously they look at the patterns of those giving and receiving isk and establish rmt transactions primarily from in-game information.i would have prefered it if mitnal had cautioned against isk-for-cash loans, but i don't think that a weak statement disclaiming responsiblity for what arrangements friends make among themselves amounts to approval of a loophole."
3/8/2009,"i guess you're welcome to try discussing this topic in coad if you really want to try, but unless you're actively trashing the reputation of an individual or alliance based on their in-game political affiliations then you'll most likely only see it moved or locked for being off topic for the forum ...or more closely related to your second point, perhaps they have no intention of making any immediate changes to the eula because there is really no hole in the eula being exploited, just players making their own private arrangements, between each other and outside of the game environment where ccp know they can't police it - all without supporting the real rmt vendors.maybe they also recognize that these loans have the potential to actually hurt rmt vendors and even further drive e/gtc sales.1) if a loan defaults and the person who issued the in-game isk consequently keeps the rl currency submitted as security for the loan (the point of having said security provided) there is nothing to stop them using that same rl currency to purchase an e/gtc from ccp or one of their distributors and injecting that rl currency into ccp. alternatively, they could even use it to finance their own game account directly.it doesn't mean the rl currency is necessarily going to funnel into the banking account of a sweatshop in hubei province. if people want to rmt, and i mean really rmt then they're much more likely to use an rmt service like the one i've linked a report on. the hysteria people are exhibiting over the concept behind this thread and the other is getting silly.let us also not forget that the ""security"" provded for the loan may have nothing at all to do with rl currency at all. it is just as possible for the security to be in the form of information, such as requiring ones rl address or contact information, in some cases even actually signing and sending official documentation (statutory declaration and identification proof in the case of australia) stating that you are liable for a specific amount of rl funds to use to recover losses in the form of an e/gtc in the event of a default/scam - not actual rl currency itself.2) sophistry being by definition being ""a subtle, tricky, superficially plausible, but generally fallacious method of reasoning."" and fallacious often meaning deceptive or misleading, please don't try to use big words to insinuate other people are liars. you're not likely to get away with it without a challenge and it means i have to double check terms on dictionary.com.oh, so i guess you're talking at me, now ...the point of the comment i made was to illustrate the fact that the loan of in-game isk with rl currency as security is probably outside the reasonable abilities of ccp to identify, track and persecute with accuracy. i said it to further build my argument that it is pointless to enact needless and reactionary changes to the eula when the economic system evolves beyond some peoples comfort zone even slightly.as for the rest of your off-topic tirade, i'm not going to concern myself with it."
3/8/2009,"not sure how ccp could really do anything about it on a large scale, as actively enforcing/investigating would be a rather large financial strain compared to the rmt actually involved. if they are informed and have proof, then yes they should drop the ban hammer, and should definitely make sure those activities are covered in the eula.look at it this way.. (conspiracy nut time) if isk acquires any kind of stable rm valuation i could see cash strapped governments trying to tax in game assets.. not likely, but given the current world economic difficulties, ya never know."
3/8/2009,"wrong.china taxes it already. if there's an incentive to do something, somebody will do it. that includes western governments doing the exact same as the membrane between virtual worlds and the real world breaks down."

3/8/2009,"not supported. current game mechanics aren't perfect, but its better than this. way too much like world of warcraft.-isaac starstriker"
3/8/2009,"here's the idea, apologies if it has been suggested already.in each region there is a shuttle service. you can use it to be transported from station to station in any system in the region, as long as it is 0.5 to 1.0 and the station is an npc station.this means it is an empire based, high-sec thing only, meaning no one can use it to stealth into other peoples poss and such. i suspose you could add some functionality to make a pos become on the grid, a shuttle service depot module maybe for those that want people coming to thier station.this also means that if u want to go into low-sec or 0.0 you still are at risk cause you have to fly your ship. the cost is based on number of system/jumps you are going, but not really high cost, say 1k per jump? 500 per jump?this shuttle service transports just the pilot .. nothing else, no cargo.the idea for this comes from seeing those convoys going in and out of stations and thinking, maybe some of them are passenger liners and such or carrying passengers as part of thier freight. ok .. flame away lol"
3/8/2009,i of course support my own idea .. lol
3/8/2009,your ideas is good and pretty solid.but it will never fly.jump clones.... setting up a clone in a different location and podding yourself.... these are just a few of the methods pilots use to get around.the pilots are capsulers... not passengers of any particular ship...all your doing is encouraging a very lazy game.not supported.
3/8/2009,"buy a shuttle, autopilot. fast, cheap, requires no changes of game mechanics. i see no reason to implement this."
3/8/2009,quoting for the truth. --isaac
3/8/2009,"well it would mean u didn't have to buy a shuttle and no worring about autopiloting to a place. you merely click the button, choose the destination and poof, there u are for a few isk. don't see why that wouldn't be such a bad thing."
3/8/2009,"you don't have to buy a shuttle - noob ships and pods also work perfectly well. but since paying a few isk isn't a problem for you, i figured you'd also be fine with paying 10k or so for a shuttle."
3/8/2009,so you want a jumpclone?

3/8/2009,"of course not. that would just be terrible, wouldn't it?"
3/8/2009,"how about an alteration to the character sheet skills tab, an added drop-down box, to where you can alter the level of the skill, for say learning purposes and formulas. you set the (skill) to the desired level but still have the option to train skills. instead of modifying how fast the skills train, give a dual ability to affect their level. as for testing learning times try this scenario, you set all of the learning skills to either untrained or 1, pick a skill, say spaceship command, set it to level 1. now, test the training and other effects on the skills time, this would give you the option to just test the times easily or jump straight into different situations. bug hunting would be much more efficient and with the added ideas of resets or other possible ""freeloading"" players with titan dances, testing of new changes would be incredibly accurate. this along with the devoted or logically thinking players would create very detailed and well rounded ship configurations and enable inexperienced players to also find their niche in the game.edit: tired, poor sentence structure, and my jumbled ideas. enjoy"
3/8/2009,"forget it, they talked about this issue a while ago, and could not even be bothered to post the results, i had to evemail a csm member to get them.and his reply was something along the lines of.sorry we didn't post about this. erm. we forgot. devs don't want this, were not doing it.(they don't want the database changed for any reason on tq > sisi) (guess they forgot about pos's)"

3/8/2009,"you seem awfully bothered about this for someone who tries to seem as if he didn't care. you know i wub u miss mckinnon, but you're just so easy to tease. let me guess, you got older brothers/sisters?"
3/8/2009,to be politicaly correct this is my main and the other is my alt. i play the game with him but i will always be le poupon.
3/8/2009,"that is similar to the relationship i have with the captain. i am glad we are having this forthright discussion, hatred from nexus notwithstanding"
3/8/2009,wrong on both counts...
3/8/2009,"hi, cat herei was wondering what kind of policies and the like are popular, and what is unpopular for csm candidates to speak of. i mean, the business of pirating is one of the items that will be on my agenda, but as to what other policies i may wish to enforce, well, i'm at a loss... but piracy, while at the top of my agenda, will hopefully not make up the bulk of it.this isn't a thread to ask, what policies are good, so i can use them and win deal, but i am genuinely interested in what the issues that make players tick.i, cat o'ninetails, would love to represent you in the most applicable manner possible, but at this point i must ask for the community's ideas to best facilitate this goal.what do you want out of your csm candidates? and how can i provide that?what issues are really bugging you? and how can i help solve them?what do you need that you don't have? and how can i help you to obtain it?just to reiterate, this is not me trolling for things to include in my policy to achieve win, but this is a genuine ""what's on your mind"" deal. so what policies would be useful for a candidate to have?much love- cat xoxoxox"
3/8/2009,not being antithetical to core elements of gameplay.
3/8/2009,stfu and gtfo !!!
3/8/2009,how about being the hero against certain core elements of gameplay?
3/8/2009,"i will vote for you, if you agree to wear these on all csm meetings you participate in. i'm not too picky, so you can wear other cat ears, if the type in the link isn't to your liking. that is all i'm asking. i can acquire everything else i need without any help."
3/8/2009,yes i will do thatnow i want cat ears :(
3/8/2009,"like, for example, carebearism? e: forgot to add, where pompous blazes the trail, cat is soon behind lol"
3/8/2009,"i'd settle for /an hero.(in-game, of course.)"
3/8/2009,"welli solemnly promise, that if i am elected to be your representative, i will wear cat ears to every meeting.that's one election promise that is hard to beat."
3/8/2009,"i love you cat. no, seriously, i do."
3/8/2009,sweet thank you very much!! i see you have become a part of the campaign machine by having my sig in your sig so many thanks :)))cat stands for justice.
3/8/2009,"you can have a policy of saying ""all hail enslaverofminmatar!"" in every thread you make. that is very good for pr."
3/8/2009,but how would i get the minmatar vote
3/8/2009,that's just silly.
3/8/2009,"but how would you get amarr votes!? amarr > minnies in the current patch, fotm"
3/8/2009,free holy spirits.
3/8/2009,"if you have to ask what the community thinks then you obviously aren't qualified to be in csm. if you looked at the forums you would know.also, it's impossible to represent everyone (and i already know you don't give a damn about the pirates)"
3/8/2009,xindi obviously has no idea as to what he's talking about.
3/8/2009,"despite the comment to the contrary, this thread appears to be a what stance do i take to be elected, which is something people who want power ask, not what somone who wants to help the community.also so far, even cat doesn't seem to be taking this seriously (see cat ears comment)to apease me, i'd like to see1. that you care2. that you have more on your agenda than getting rid of the pirates in rancertl;dr cat needs moar/better goals"
3/8/2009,if you knew cat you would see she is very qualified for csm and helping us eve ppl and is working hard to be on csm.yes she dosent represent everyone lol how can you do that? we are innocent travellers who want ppl to hear our voice =)
3/8/2009,"it is true i don't know cat, i don't know lots of people. that is why more of a showing must be made, because so far all i know is that pirates are bad and cat likes to be funny. those aren't bad things mind you, but having one stance on one issue isn't of much help since theres many issues. i'd also be comforted if i knew cat understood the pirates point of view.once again, more caompaigning is needed.in other news; xindi has a great ideaa questions for cat thread, we ask you answer, and we get to know the real cat.sound good?"
3/8/2009,"(edited: now with more content!)i'm gonna type this out in nice long words so maybe some of it will penetrate....=================it sounds as though you have very little opinions of your own, and are interested in finding some sort of 'popular' approach that can secure votes.you seem infatuated with the idea of attaining a position that you believe will be seen as important by the community. you seem to care about that much more than bettering eve.in short, you aspire to be the very worst type of politician, only you want to fulfill your ego by corralling a spot on an advisory board for internet spaceships.any attempt to describe how pathetic that is would probably be inadequate in scope or intensity.i have never seen fit to mock you until now, despite this forum and your constant urge to bespatter it constantly with your oral discharge. this was tolerable, until you sought to screw with something that can actually have a positive effect on this game.csm members must be of a certain age (21) to participate. assuming for a moment that you meet this paltry requirement, your level of discourse in this and many other threads you've started on the subject seem to indicate that your presence at a csm meeting would unequivocally result in ccp treating the csm process as a ******* joke. in fact, they would be correct at that point, and the one, best avenue players have for influencing this game would lose whatever credibility it still has in the eyes of it's producers.in short, kindly pull your lower lip over your caldari head, and swallow.sincerely,"
3/8/2009,this
3/8/2009,"i will address each of your concerns.your first remark being that i am asking what stance to take to be elected, i refer you to my first post. if you read more deeply, you may discover that i am actually asking for opinions and points of importance rather than election-winning points. i thought that i'd made that clear in my first post.as for the cat-ear remark, well, if it happens to be a point that *someone else* has asked for, and is suitably funny and/or awesome, it will be considered. hence; if i am elected- i will be wearing cat ears to the meetings. it need not be a serious thing, but the lols are pretty decent. and to appease you,1) that i carei care deeply for the game, and i care deeply for the innocent travelers through lowsec. it is not neccesarily my position to eliminate these piraty culprits, but perhaps to allow greater freedom for the innocents over the criminals. people have mentioned that i discriminate against pirates, and while that is true to a certain degree, security status does a lot of that work without me...2) that i have more on my agenda than getting rid of the pirates in rancerwhile piracy will be always on top of my agenda, and i for one would like to see some kind of limitation of the gankage that goes on in that system. i make no secret of that. what i will say though, is that come election time, i will have to scan my passport, and probably reveal who i may be affiliated with.piracy is not the only thing on my mind."
3/8/2009,also quit forcing me to use punctuation and capitalisation lol
3/8/2009,"sunday 22nd february 2009present: ankhesentepemkah, bunyip, darius johnson, issler dainze, lavista vista, omber zombie, vuk lauwasn't i there?"
3/8/2009,"i don't remember you there and the logs say you said nothing, so i'm going with no... granted it was 2 weeks ago and i was on painkillers so my memory may have some black holes."
3/8/2009,no. we hardly even had enough people to start the meeting.
3/8/2009,"truly, we are losing two giants of the csm..."
3/8/2009,if you don't like the name of the character your contemplating buying....don't buy it.
3/8/2009,can a csm post a intuitive instruction re the best way to write out a proposal in a format the csm's recognise as a lot of proposals dont seem to make it to the meeting because the writing of such a proposal doesnt either explain the topic in way the the csm recognises and/or isnt written in a understandable way or is unclear to the csm.this should help the csm in understanding the topics brought forward and help to prevent misunderstandingthankyou
3/9/2009,good idea.
3/9/2009,perhaps you should be asking you're tacklers why a random noob beat them to the loot ? or are they noob as well.
3/9/2009,supporting the pitboss on this one. if you kill a wt you should rights to the gear that was on their ship and any one not on the km/in the corp should not be able to steal the gear without any form of danger. as for why don't your tacklers just loot the wrecks. have you ever been in a fleet fight your tacklers duty shouldnt be to run and scoop a wreck after every kill. a little while back we were in a fight and killed 5-6 ships when we were done we looked for the wrecks they were all looted and salvaged within 10-20 seconds of the fight coming to close. every single one of the looters was in a noob corp.
3/9/2009,sounds like a cool idea.
3/9/2009,"sounds fine, but frankly i'd just make it so charters (i.e. rent) are required just to keep the tower anchored. you don't pay rent, the landlord tosses your stuff and gets someone who will. all i'd do is unanchor the things 30 days after the charters ran out (a grace period to account for rl issues, and back payment required to online them.)newbish players who want to muck with the pos side of eve shouldn't have to wardec a 300 person corp just to clear out their abandonned place-keeper tower. we ought to at least have to keep them fed with charters to retain rights to the real estate."
3/9/2009,support-in part
3/9/2009,"the blasterthron wasn<U+FFFD>t some kind of i win button the last 2 years and with the web changes it is allready broken now. the core qestion would be tempest or mealstorm for sniping? rohk is here a bit special since it is the only real turret ship of all 3 tiers and required since missles don<U+FFFD>t work so well in fleet sniping scenarios.amarr -> apoc, gallente -> megathron, mini -> pest mostlyi would go 10% damage per level(since dps is allready a problem with damage&rof bonus). 9 effective turrets arn<U+FFFD>t this big thing today anyway. the tracking bonus is quite nice improving the versatility vs small stuff and his sniping ability.drones i would got 100/150 -> versatility.i personaly would also increase the base lock range of the pest a bit(10-12 km -> 20-30km after skills + mods) so it has about 220km with 2 sensor boosters.with some minor adjustments at artis(a bit more optimal and damagemod) you would have the pest again the nr. 1 alpha sniper and also a very flexible solo/small gang ship. personaly i disagree on the the shield hp bonus on the mealstorm, shure it would make it a better sniper but gimp his ability to have a strong active tank in small gang. if anything a 8/7/4 layout would be prefered, what would further increase the tank/gank role for small gangs plus a bit more speed, would be extrem badass."
3/9/2009,signed.
3/9/2009,we need our missles!
3/9/2009,missiles do suck.
3/9/2009,"ok, so the nid is ok. it has it's uses and such, but the nag....can anyone justify reasonably why this ship shouldnt be seriously buffed?(really this is also just to keep this on the first page until it's fixed)"
3/9/2009,"supported wholeheartedly. just about every character i've played as (haven't been a part of eve for long, mind you) has been minmatar, and i love the minmatar race. let's make the naglfar able to compete with the rest of the dreadnoughts out there for starters."
3/9/2009,supported. the naglfar looks way to good to be as bad as it is.
3/9/2009,great.... as if its bad enough to have a bunch of a-holes posting on these boards in one coad... it yet again happens with a 2nd one.seriously people... get a grip on reality... stop acting like monkeys throwing piles of #### at each other.either you post for or against... else... stfu and gtfo.
3/9/2009,"signed, i especially like the restriction to a single or just a couple of representatives."
3/9/2009,"great topic! the deterioration of caod has been a big disappointment of mine for awhile. this game is supposed to be for a different class of gamer. a large majority of the threads in that forum are complete crap and a deliberate attempt to sabotage the tools given to us by ccp.i personally like the idea of corp/alliance pr being the only ones doing the posting or banning entire corp/alliances as an alternative. you simply can't tell people to just ignore that particular forum, it's part of the game. that's like telling people to ignore empire space because itls cluttered with noobs.either way, i've been playing eve for 4 years now and i have seen the mentality become severely sophomoric and irrelevant. please do something about it."
3/9/2009,"just because jade constantine wants a forum where he can advance her agenda without being laughed at doesn't mean that we should give it to him. its a disgrace that we are even considering her proposal, she can do it on his own forum if she needs a place where no one will point out all his inadequacies. we once had a place like the one you're discussing (granted; we had it after jade was banned for trolling, so she never got to participate in it) and it died a long slow death of irrelevancy as no one posted in it and no one cared about it.caod does not need to die, if it did, nothing would fuel the enmity that makes this game worth playing. why should i log in if i don't relish shooting my enemies? how will i really despise them without some place to get riled up? should we all just get along and play nice? no, and we should not all play jade's game because he has tricked a few people with long posts and words they don't understand."
3/9/2009,"goum, there's a difference between fiery discussion and outright trolling. caod has slowly descended into the latter."
3/9/2009,unban jade constantine. ban all goonies from caod.
3/9/2009,well for starters i think its posts like this one:
3/9/2009,/signed
3/9/2009,community (csm) is better suited to moderate itself than the moderators as they are closer to the community thus i reject this proposal in favour of the one currently above it that seeks to grant moderation powers to the csm. i urge everyone to do the same.
3/9/2009,"the above thread doesn't have anything to do with csm moderating the forums, it's about raising issues to do with forums without getting a blanket ""forums are outside csm purview"" response."
3/9/2009,argue semantics all you like. you support your little pet project while the res of us actually try to solve something. luv nacn
3/9/2009,"the proposal has got nothing to do with individual players but has everything to do with players wanting a cleaner more professional political discussion point with troll posts and flames drastically reduced,it just so happens jade typed out some ideas which were actually quite good there were other ideas such as;by scagga laebetrovo***ingame corp interface: create a spokesperson position that gives a 'can post on caod' abilityadditional rules:- costs 25m to appoint or change a spokesperson- 1 spokesperson per 50 members in corp other than ceo (ceo can always post)ok, now for some off the wall ideas:other rule for caod:- you cannot post on caod if you have less than 50m isk in your wallet- 50m isk fine to the poster if get moderated on caod- increased severity or frequency of offenses = bans***there are plenty of ideas out there that have been posted all with merits but the end result is a lot of players want/require caod to be improved,as i said this thread is not about individuals but about corperations and alliances and having a political forum clean of flames/trolls/spam where corps/alliances can have the freedom to post within the rules and not running the risk of their voice being drowned out by hundreds of trolls"
3/9/2009,"erm, correct me if i am wrong, but cannot alt corps just do the same thing? alt alliances already exist in this game and 25mil/member is meaningless.all that is needed, is to have better moderation. just more people to check and delete crappy threads. but that creates a problem in that too much moderation makes coad as boring to read as shc's war & politics secion.ceo only forums would end up having alt corps in them, thus ceo being a alt. so it does not solve the issue, just transfer it. coad just needs better policing, it does not need new laws."
3/9/2009,"lord waratron, the idea is 'not' ceo's only but alliance leaders/ceos and diplomats i would suggest at least 5 (depending on how many corps are in that alliance) for a alliance maybe 2 or 3 for a corpthis would still allow for a good set of posting however if one person in that entity is warned or banned its not the player thats warned or banned but the entity he/she represents"
3/9/2009,"say it all you want, that does not make it true. this proposal has everything to do with individual players, and you would know this if you'd bothered to read the thread in question, or look up the history of the person in particular.so instead we drown out their voice with zero posts in a forum that no one reads and no one cares about? we've tried this forum before, it did not work. lets not do it again and remove the enmity from caod that fuels the conflict this game was built around.as well, when people troll your thread, it goes to the top of the page. you would think that by having your thread trolled you would be grateful for the extra exposure that you were being granted. if no one posts, it gets ignored and falls off the first page and no one reads it again. if you want to not read goon posts, just ignore them. read the things you want. certainly the threads in question have proven that such a thing is very possible. i mean, if it weren't you couldn't even have had the thread that sparked this in the first place, right? it would have been trolled into oblivion and all those long winded ""non-troll"" posts that you are pinning so bad for would never have been written. maybe the problem is more that people don't want to post long winded ""non-troll"" posts rather than they think they'll get trolled?you're right. one of them is more honest. its the trolling, the trolling is more honest."
3/9/2009,supporting the op
3/9/2009,"supporting the op.also, how interesting it is that those strongly opposed to this idea are the very same that have made it necessary."
3/9/2009,"that's funny, i haven't seen kenny members here opposing this idea."
3/9/2009,good ideas m8
3/9/2009,"indeed - very funny. there are though, thankfully, goons opposing this, which makes my statement correct. otherwise you might have had a point."
3/9/2009,personaly i think caod section should be for battlereports/anouncements...not spam..wich is 99.(99)% atm
3/9/2009,"so what you're saying is it was okay when caod was the stomping grounds of kenny & co., but it's not okay when goons return the favor. got it."
3/9/2009,whatever cleans it up gets my vote.
3/9/2009,"if thats the way you want to read it then fine. there have always been problems with people/groups abusing coad. my opinion, which is what i am contributing here, is that things have just got beyond reasonable in recent months. sure, there are various groups responsible for it - but the worst of the worst offenders are goons. again - only my opinion. it just happens to be one shared by many many others."
3/9/2009,"how could any supporter of free speech support this?not only no, but hell no."
3/9/2009,i don't so much see this as a campaign against freedom of speech its more or less supporting the proper use of the forums. posts about self destructing nag's don't seem to be the proper use of the forums.
3/9/2009,some very good ideas.
3/9/2009,supporting this.
3/9/2009,"i was already proposed this idea by more then few players, and as leader of one big alliance i totally support this it. both small and big alliances can benefit from this. i will raise it for the following meeting."
3/9/2009,i know this is thread necromancy. but i recently rejoined eve. and thus wasnt here when this was made.i throw in my full support for this idea.
3/9/2009,please bring back events. i need a new mothership for free.thanksxoxoxoxo
3/9/2009,hello ccp i like to roleplay but i am too lazy and lack the imagination to come up with something interesting myself so ccp if you could send one of your employees over to my system and hold my hand so i can roleplay without putting in any effort or initiative that would be great! thanks!!!
3/9/2009,"eve is the only mmo where the players can really create the story, and that is how it should be. that and the potential corruption and favoritism that can arise from this suggestion is a very bad thing in the very competitive game that eve is. just say no to ccp run events."
3/9/2009,fully supported!i was hopeing for more of this with the on set of faction warefare but was disapointed.tribe
3/9/2009,this is exactly the problems that must be addressed. and if proper measures are taken they are completely preventable. just like t20 scandal introduced ccp's internal affiars. this would fall under their purview.saying live events shouldn't be introduced because they bring opportunity for corruption is like saying eve online shouldn't be developed because developers can be corrupted. it's already happened. and now more than ever they have protocalls and an entire department dedicated to making sure there is never another t20. which reports to the ceo of ccp.if the ceo of ccp is corrupt. eve is ****ed anyway.
3/9/2009,"there is a reason that they removed in game rp events because people, unlike ai are biased and prone to corruption. we don't want dev resources wasted on something like this."
3/9/2009,it is entirely preventable. especially now with internal affairs reporting to the head of ccp. you cant assume the whole of ccp is corrupt.
3/9/2009,"let them rp as much as they want, but please don't waste any resources on this, ccp."
3/9/2009,"a couple of weeks ago we had biggest long-running soap opera in eve resolved at last by the destruction of the band of brothers alliance at the hands of goonswarm and allies. this is the resolution of a very old plotline  tied into the launch of eve, the development of 0.0 empires  of vital interest to anybody playing a character in the game of eve online.it was a raging success.and i dont think you need to be a rocket scientist to understand what was missing: the potential for dev interference. let's ****ing keep it that way now you've finally got it working, eh?"
3/9/2009,i support this as it will permit jade to focus on things that he understands well (rp) as opposed to things that he does not (0.0).
3/9/2009,"i know that there's enough people irked at this exploit being abused so much and that there are some relatively simple changes that would make it less abusable.my personal favorite is the ""login timer"", which would be like a reverse aggro timer.1) if you log in in space (and only if you log in in space) your ship must remain for a minimum of 5 minutes, during which time it can be aggroed regardless of whether you are connected or not.2) for the 30 second timer after disconnect, you are vulnerable to aggro mechanics.3) after logging out, your warpin point never moves until you have actually completed a warp back to it, regardless of how many times you log out.that would mean that anyone who logged in, then logged out to move their warpin would be vulnerable to being probed out and aggroed within 5 minutes, and would take the logoffski==safe brigade and cut them off at the knees.it would also mean that those who logoff under gatecloak (or after hitting the jump button) would be able to be tagged with aggro without having to resort to silliness like an aoe weapon on a covert ops."
3/9/2009,yes please
3/9/2009,universal love of this idea is entirely understandable. so annoying looking for the damaged item.
3/9/2009,"add/change a few drone settings.preferred target size-drones (prefer other drones)-frigate (includes all frigate hull ships)-cruiser (all cruiser/bc hulls)-battleship (bs hulls and turrets/structures)-auto (default, drones pick a target relevant to their own size according to sig radius and velocity)assist owner-yes (default, drones bias themselves to attacking the same target as their owner - makes logistics drones assist owner if idle, after a several second 'recalibration' delay to balance it)-no (drones target independently)grouped drones-yes (default, one drone is assigned the 'leader' and processes all ai for the other 'slave' drones)-no (drones process ai independently)behaviour-aggressive (pick a hostile target and attack, regardless whether that target is firing or not)-defensive (default, attack when fired upon only)-interception (attack other drones and ships that are using ewar/web/scram/neut/nos on the owner only)-passive (stay idle unless given an order by the owner)auto target acquire behaviour-normal (drones switch targets as normal)-smart (default, drones switch target if their current one's total hp hasn't gone down over ten or so volleys)-guided (drones bias what they attack to whatever the owner has targeted)interception priority (what gets highest priority for interception behaviour)-warp disrupted (default)-webified-ewar-capacitor drain (with neut being higher priority than nos)logistical behaviour (how logistics drones behave)-fleet (give assistance automatically to the closest damaged fleet member until they are back to 100%, then switch to another)-friend (default, same as assist fleet, except the drones include people with standing above 5 and any corp/alliance members)-all (drones attempt to assist everyone, except hostiles/criminals/people with less than 0 standing)-passive (drones remain idle)check aggression flag?-yes (default, logistics drones do not assist flagged players/people who are at war)-nomwd range (sets the distance at which drones will start using their mwd)-always (default, drones use their mwd all the time they're out of range of their target)-5km-10km-never (drones don't use their mwd at all)between those settings, drones could be set up to perform specific actions.is this a decent suggestion?"
3/9/2009,not sure if all of the above will work out... but it is much needed.supported!
3/9/2009,"i agree this is a much needed feature, especially for those of use who use drones as primary defensive weapons (re. mining barge pilots).i would at least like to see it looked at.supported."
3/9/2009,i like
3/9/2009,!
3/9/2009,looks good.
3/9/2009,this would give drone users a bit more control over their primary weapon system.a good thing.any improvement to drone ai/ui would be a good thing.
3/9/2009,"more love for drones is desperately needed. these changes seem sound and hopefully some will get implemented. drones certainly need it. a few comments:grouped drones, why is this needed? i guess i don't understand what you mean by this. auto-target behavior seems a little too afk-control to me and not needed. but that is my opinion. (yes, current drone controls are kinda ""afk-control"")check agression flag = needed. great idea!otherwise, support is given for this idea. --isaac"
3/9/2009,i for one support this.
3/9/2009,"i gave some thought to that grouping option.using that would be more effective than focus fire, and reduce load on the server too.drones, as they are, are afk weapons anyway though."
3/9/2009,"not sure if i like the details of this proposal or not, but i'm all for better, more complex, drone ai. it's gotten far better since i've started playing, but there's some room to improve yet."
3/9/2009,supported
3/9/2009,"while the idea certainly has merit i'm not sure that you'd want to automate too many things in eve, that would be the same as setting your guns to automatically target and attack the ones that are tackling you.that and ofcourse you expecting these new drones routines to actually, you know... work. just as they have been able to make drones work properly over the past years with the little amount of variables they currently have.the only real setting i'd be interested in is ""attack target closest to ship/attack target closest to drone"". that in itself is not overpowered but takes care of most of the issues without taking away the requirement to actually think about what you're doing. it could/should also be something ccp devs could actually make work.so, not supported, sorry."
3/9/2009,"yes, please"
3/9/2009,"i've noticed that a lot of the time in a big fleet, people get killed and lag makes it so that their pod just sits there while the session changes and they spam the warp-to button. this makes it easy for enemies to podkill them.why not have a warp-to command instead of having to right-click and hit the ""warp to 0"" or the ""warp to...."" button?we have a targeting function (ctrl + left mouse). why can't we have a warp function?(ctrl-w + left mouse or w + left mouse)i think that this would be a very helpful tool to have in the game.no, it would not reduce pvp in any way. by the time you really need to use this, you are already out of your combat ship and in your pod.what say you?"
3/9/2009,"never really had a problem. if i know i am going down i just change over to my run!!! tab and start spamming a random moon and i never have an issue, unless there is a bubble of course."
3/9/2009,"not a terrible idea...but i seriously wonder if that's needed. however, it seems to be a thought out idea. its one of a few command keys we could use. so support.--isaac"
3/9/2009,"simple, logical and not overpowered."
3/9/2009,since this can be achieved with an overview tab might as well just implement it.
3/9/2009,"bumpity. thanks for your support.i personally think that this is a simple addition, and would greatly help many people through something small and simple."
3/9/2009,i guess you guys havn't realized what the rest of the lame eve world that can't pilot a ship has allready. the hot key you speak of is ctrl q. i don't see why we need a button to remove thinking from the game. a proper overview setup goes a long way.
3/9/2009,this change is stupid. allowing a skill to train when someone takes a break from the game encourages return business.
3/9/2009,"bring back ghost training.calling it an 'abused bug' is a absurd joke when it was touted as a 'feature' not so long ago in ccp's own player guide and marketing information.let me guess though, the inability to train all the characters on your account concurrently is still a feature and not a bug."
3/9/2009,"you're avoiding the question, yet again.alliances can already exist only one corp in them. the key to the problem is allowing a corp to be kicked out of the alliance immediately, without a period of time in between. when a player is kicked out of the corp, his/her roles have to be removed, and there's a period of 24 hours before s/he can be kicked. if you argue that alliances aren't corps, then you're only support the fact that this is an oversight, and in need of revisiting.""it doesn't do as much damage as people seem to think it does"" ... i think you should rethink that statement to be closer inline with the truth. your alliance and your leader have done nothing but lobbying the damage that has been done since the opportunity to ""exploit"" an oversight presented itself in form of a disgruntled director with too much power in his hand.and ""pendantic"" isn't a word in the english language. yet. so i think it's safe to say that your entire post make no sense whatsoever."
3/9/2009,"people keep drawing parallels between what happened to bob and conglomerates in real life, but the whole picture is not taken into consideration.in real life, you can kick all the corps in a conglomerate, but it can not be done overnight. too much paperwork, and light stepping is involved to avoid a potentially bankrupting lawsuit. this was an oversight by ccp, and should be addressed.*edit*let us forget an alliance, a disgruntled director firing all the employees in a corp cos he was dissatisfied with the way he was treated will spend the rest of his career making money to pay his ex-employees"
3/9/2009,"i say the game mechanic should be modified. i'm saying modded do to some real corp's do have 1 person in charge and by working with or for someone with that much power this is what can happen. now i suggest that instead of one or the other something needs to be added. what i purpose is that an option be included for larger alliances maybe 7 and up corps, that they can divvy the power up between the corp their for giving them votes to. kind of like dictatorship vs republic. ccp can work out the finer details. remember, when bill gate's owned microsoft he could have destroyed the corp that he built. but let people buy stock and he didn't own the company anymore but stock holders. they voted a board of directors that to gether made the decision. as you can see one person or many can deside peoples fate, i think thats what needs to be added."
3/9/2009,auto targeting?? this must be why my blockade runner exploded that crushed me where is the crying like a baby emote...
3/9/2009,"that? oh, and /signed"
3/9/2009,supporting this. as well as several other good points raised in this thread.
3/9/2009,suported
3/9/2009,anything to improve the pos!!!
3/9/2009,"how about you bums actually read the original fuel brick thread? instead of just wanting anything new manufacturing-wise and not reading anything (looking at you lvv) you should actually think about what ccp proposed.it is a bad plan with numerous downsides that have been gone over repeatedly in that thread. there are many player-created ideas in that thread that are better than the original ccp idea.it's pretty obvious that people in this thread can't handle more than a few sentences, so i will try to paraphrase:the proposal was meant to streamline pos logistics however it only made it more complicated. good idea, bad proposed mechanics. fail."
3/9/2009,what's so complicated about letting carebears gather materials and turn them into a use all fuel pellet?
3/9/2009,"i read a dozen or so pages of it a few months back, and while there were some legitimate complaints(most notably, that poses would no longer serve as backup fuel depots for capital jump drives), it still seemed to me that the consensus was broadly in favour. it's been a while, so my memory may be wrong, but i thought people liked it. if ccp decided that the idea wasn't worth doing then fair enough, but when a thread has been stickied for that long, it'd at least be polite to have a dev post and say ""actually, never mind"", instead of just pulling it down and letting it die."
3/9/2009,"""saved overview tabs will now display in the correct alphabetical order."" it would be great to have the same thing for drone groups....carrier pilots would love thisand also if posible to add sub-groopex: groop > sub-groupheavy > em"
3/9/2009,"i don't know about you, but my drone groups have always displayed in correct order. i'm for sub-groups, though."
3/9/2009,"you are correct here. resources are hard to come by because everyone else is out to get their hands on the massive amount of available resources. war decs play right into this. ""penny my buy/sell orders and you get a dec.""the rest of this drivel is pointless. ""you people"", as in the people declaring war, know exactly what the ""carebears"" are doing because... *gasp* their alts are the carebears. sure they will deny it... but its the truth."
3/9/2009,"war dec's are no longer made over resources.that is an utter lie and you people know it.war dec's are made over whatever the hell they want to make it over...and over 95% of them are over ""because they can and want to kill your ships"" reason.as for the ""carebears"" whom you refer to being the ones manufacturing those ships and materials.""well duh""if you can't see that...your really are blind.the market is player driven... that stuff doesn't come from some fanciful fictional time warp in space... its manufactured... or gathered from missions.the greater majority of industry and manufacturing takes place in 0.0 space however... as most corps have to be very large or in an alliance as no new corp ever makes it past the gauntlet of war-dec greifing that takes place.you want to make war-dec's more interesting?take away the single reason why they happen in the first place (the ability to kill without concord) and make it literally what you ""pretend"" to think it is.if it was over resources... then make it over resources literally.include materials... ships...bpo's... territory... there are many things of value that would put the motivation and driving factor in war-decs.but as it is... war-decs are literally a joke to me... ok... corp a war-decs corp b.wow.... corp a is doing it because corp b is small and easy prey.. corp a will never war-dec someone bigger than they are unless they get other corps to join in.corp b leaves corp and goes to alts.waht did you expect to happen? them sitting there letting you blow up?welcome to game theroy 101 folks.... that or human nature.i have no issues with war-decs... but stop fooling yourselves... try 0.0 space for a bit and see what real war-dec'ing is all about.war-dec's are an outlet to forced pvp.regardless of what you people think of eve... its not about 100% non-consenual pvp.if it was... it would be much like warhammer online and anyone and everyone would pvp anywhere at anytime.of course i wouldn't like it very much if it was no pvp at all in high sec... it would make life rather boring.my point is... seek a middle road... a balance... and stop making crap up for enforcing either side.the carebears hate it.... because its forced on them... so build a mechanic that will make it a bit lucrative for them to fight back.the pvp'ers like the blood and the tears.... fine.... make it a bigger and more difficult challenge... not the ""i-win"" button they smack because they have more ships than you do.isk is too easy to make.. war-dec's fees are too damn cheap.... this cycle will be exponentially infinite and impossible to stop until you both.... manage to agree on something."
3/9/2009,"the csm was very surprised a few months ago to discover that the forum moderation team had placed itself beyond the purview of the csm. the reasoning behind this was stated by wrangler as being that the csm is meant to deal with game issues and the forums are somehow separate from this. i move that this is a farcical conclusion, and that the forums are very much a part of the game. if that is not the case then why have forums at all? why maintain them? why have forums based on the game if they provide no benefit or have no impact on the game?alliances and corporations do indeed action based on what happens on the forums. as such i say that the forums are very much a part of the game and the forum moderation team is just as in need of the csm's oversight as anything else.i will not delve into specifics except to say that at a high level, someone needs to be responsible and there does need to be oversight regarding actions taken on behalf of the community on these forums. this thread will serve as a discussion point for that subject and i believe personally that the csm needs to get involved, as the moderation team has been found wanting. why should the forums be treated any different than any other aspect of eve? what about the forums is so magical that they should be able to operate with immunity? this is stupid.discuss."

3/9/2009,"quis custodiet ipsos custodes?edit: that's a serious point, and not just a reference to topical movies. ""who watches the watchers"" is a fundamental axiom of natural law. i'm appalled, after the shocking history of the moderation team in the past (which was one of the key reasons for the creation of the csm institution, for newer players who are unaware) that the current team think that they are above oversight."

3/9/2009,"the idea that the forums are unrelated to the game is nonsensical at best, and deliberately misleading at worst. c'mon guys, don't pee on my leg and tell me it is raining."
3/9/2009,why would there need to be any oversight over the forums that isn't driven by the player base? i'd like to know that the people moderating the discussions at least had a rudimentary knowledge of game mechanics and politics. who better defines those qualities than a csm?

3/9/2009,"nothing should beyond the control of the players, except things that should be, but this isn't one of them."
3/9/2009,"the forums are a vital extension to the game as they are the primary source of information for players not directly involved in an event. this is made especially crucial given that the in-game news that comes up every once in a while only covers truly spectacular events (well, mostly) and as such smaller stories tend to go unnoticed.if the forums are an important part of the game experience, it stands to reason that the moderation thereof should be a topic for discussion by the csm."
3/9/2009,i agree whole heartedly
3/9/2009,"this has always baffled me as well. i've seen many topics being closed as ""offtopic"" or ""not relevant"", even though it is crystal clear to all the involved parties what the thread is about and why it is relevant (often, this is obvious from the reactions as well, but the thread still gets closed).so, why do we let forum moderators who appear to have little clue of what is actually going on in the game (to interpret these kinds of actions in the most favorable light imaginable) decide what is somehow ""relevant""?"

3/9/2009,bias is the problem in the first place. i think the council would take umbrage with the fact that you would lump them in with the goons.
3/9/2009,i support this proposal
3/9/2009,"i dont think he did threaten you irl it was char to char,also im concerned re your wording of 'perview' it suggests to me that the gm's/moderators have to report to the csm's no matter if they maybe all goons or not (who knows what future block voting may cause) in their decisions re punitive measures re rule breaking on the forum,tbh as i said id rather that decision remain with ccp although i would support ccp involving the csm's re forum changes and/or to include punitive measures for continous rule breakers :)"
3/9/2009,it places the mods on the same playing ground as everyone else in ccp. char to char or irl is up to the mods to decide. unfortunately that's a bad thing.
3/9/2009,"currently if you want to change say your standings to make someone blue or reset the standings. the person needs to be in the executing corp.often diplomatic roles go to other people in the alliance. not necessarily in the executing corp.i would like ccp to work on improving this system. creating literally a board of members who can be given alliance roles.1. this will mean that diplomats wont require to be in the executing corp needlessly, or have an alt in said position.2. at the same time increased security can be achieved in order to potentially protect an alliance if they are smart with who they give said roles to.so for example. anyone in the alliance could be given the alliance role of diplomat. which grants you the role of changing standings on behalf of the alliance.another might be called recruiter who is capable of reviewing and accepting application from corporations into the alliance.another might be called warmonger who is capable of issuing changes to wardecs or even declaring them."
3/9/2009,"i don't have a problem with this per se, but what is so hard or dangerous about putting an alpha clone alt in the executor corp?"
3/9/2009,"like the idea, especially if it's as part of a broader overhaul of corp/alliance role mechanics. they need a lot of work. it's not difficult, merely stupid and unnecessary. alts are wonderful things, but they shouldn't be relied upon as a workaround for poorly implemented mechanics."
3/9/2009,this would be damn sexy to have. if only for movie-making.
3/9/2009,quite true.
3/9/2009,"i like it, it's rather refreshing, and so thus supported"
3/9/2009,"as a progressive human and a gallente, i raise this very important issue to any society:i was recently gagged on the help channel accused of trolling, after i told an ism he was abusing (his position), tat i was paying his salary (although i see ism doesnt get paid) and writing freedom of speech!!!! after he/she was telling someone not to use the word f*****g (watever tat means). i wasnt angering and offending the community as per rules and policy but stating my point of view. i really wonder why they were telling the other person not to use that word. why some people think one word is worse than another? why they deem one word obscene and not for example the words ""kill"", ""murder""? i dont think any word should be censored. censoring prevents the spread of information, hinder progress, science and even moral. the use and giving or not giving ""second"" meaning to words is a matter of personal beliefs, objectivity and degree of intelligence. a word is a word. period. whatever meaning anyone give it is up to those people; for any organization censuring it for being ""obscene"" just indicates a tribal belief system and not much of intellectual advance, progress or freedom.it was a disturbing experience being gagged because not only i could not talk to my corp members or write mail (which are completely unrelated to the situtation), they didnt ask me nor i could raise my concerns, ask for a supervisor or ask where to go to make my point, which actually is the very same thing that happens to journalists in totalitarian regimes. i believe freedom of speech is essential to any civilized and advanced society and the restriction of which comes to repression and injustice.hopefully this situation was an isolated one and not system wide policy of eve online. say no to censorship and long live freedom of speech"
3/9/2009,"ive heard this term 'freedom of speech' bandied across the forums quite a lot latelystanding on a soapbox airing your views is one thing but airing your views in a racist, defamatory or obscene way is not freedom of speech and it isnt what freedom of speech is all about,i suggest you grow and wake up me lad"
3/9/2009,"there is no freedom of speech here, this is an internet spaceships game, not the enlightenment..."
3/9/2009,freedom of speech is the right to have an opinion... not the right to say anything you want.if it was the right to say anything you wanted... i could call you a dumb #### who can't see or read or understand and that your totally ######## and full of ######## and so stupid... you can't see straight.but i can't.o/
3/9/2009,freedom of speach is a right of citizens of some nations. i'm pretty sure there is no bill of rights in the eula.
3/9/2009,"you have no freedom of speech when you're using ccp's stuff- their servers, their rules.also, the word you're misusing is ""censor"". to ""censure"" is to punish, to censor is to restrict or prevent something from being said.you're pretty much wrong in every possible way, including the ability to type coherently, construct a sentence or create a paragraph. you have failed in your understanding and you have failed to make a cogent argument in even the remotest sense of the word."
3/9/2009,i'm going to beat a dead horse here because:1) i like doing it and 2) i'm at work and i am bored.freedom of speech does does not exist in an mmo due to the fact that:1) it is not a country that has freedom of speech and 2) op is a silly person (i needed a #2 and this was all i could come up with)
3/9/2009,"freedom of speech is a legitimate human right, freedom to use someone else's resources to express that speech is not. i have no right to speak in someone else's house, to be published in someone else's newspaper, or to post on someone else's server. the only thing that freedom of speech encompasses is the right to use resources at my disposal to express opinions and spread information without fear of government persecution(subject to limits like libel/slander laws, privacy, copyright, incitement to violence restrictions, etc.). swearing in a public chat channel of one particular computer game is not a human right, and suggesting that it is is a sad mockery of what legitimate human rights are for. learn to act like a gentleman in public places, and respect the space that ccp lets you use instead of trying to defile it by doing things that you have been explicitly told you should not do. eve isn't counterstrike."
3/9/2009,"if stupidity was a crime, the op would be executed. (ingame)"
3/9/2009,"it is really sad to see how careless and not knowledgeable about freedom of speech people are. unfortunately, same is in society in general, with the end result very appreciable: abuse, wars, jailings, torture, killings, even our own life span, for people against freedom jammed science for thousands of years claiming it was obscene and killing everyone who tried to bring research or improvement to human kind. 1. the more you in your own home, your company, your online game, yourself dont let someone else be free to speak as they want, the more you are endangering society to fail as a free civilization. one person or one million people, you are endangering society for restricting speech. 2.any restriction to speech is dangerous. a.racist: such race has this more cases of disease than such race. banned speech for being racial. end result: hindering health research; b.obscene: dont teach people about sexually transmitted diseases. end result: spread of sexually transmmitted diseases and increase population mortality (this actually happens in many countries)c.defamatory: someone presents evidence that a politician is involved in a crime. witness jailed for defamation. end result: spread of crime. (i wont mention countries where this happens regularly)d.dangerous speech: someone yells fire. gets arrested for being there no fire. next time no one yells fire for fear of being mistaken. there was a fire. end result:widespread destruction. freedom is an absolute with many categories that stand in direct opposition to each other. certainly as such one might choose which freedom to restrict and which to free. because, yes, freedom can destroy other freedoms and be even a danger to itself. but in undergoing this task humanity is prone to make many mistakes. we really shouldnt tamper with freedom unless absolutely necessary. doing so imperils our own existence. so, we have to be careful in curtailing freedom and not doing it wantonly as it is done sadly most of the time. many people unfortunately dismiss freedom as nothing important but its actually of the utmost importance, so much so that millions have died throughout the entire human history in order to defend it or to achieve it. so there is no context where freedom should become irrelevant. freedom is always relevant. long live freedom"
3/9/2009,so what your saying is... i can call you a total liar and an idiot.. and there's not a damn thing you can do about it.... especially if we all agree and refuse to accept anything you say as fact right?reality is cold... just like eve.welcome to eve online.
3/9/2009,"i could go on and try to let you know in how much you are wrong but to be honest acwdc78 i wouldnt know where to start,it would be like trying to tell a terroist they are wrong in blowing people up, or telling a police officer to go screw himself or even better trying to advise a racially bigotted person not to go to ethnic minority area wearing *** propoganda.people like yourself dont know about free speech because you just havent a foggiest notion what its about, but as others have said this is a forum provided by ccp its not a political debate re ethics or morality,go stand on a soap box in a public street and mouth your free speech ideas and not on these forums"
3/9/2009,close the loophole. better safe than sorry.
3/9/2009,"hello!i have one idea for shorten our journey through the empire only empire i think!that the ccp put the specialized star gates in the certain solar systems that we can jump 5 or 10 jumps through empire at once!!?and with that,it would be interesting to play eve!"
3/9/2009,"well i'm often on the road in althrough the empire,20-30 jumps constantly and i must say that i like the idea of somewhat superhighway that would shorten the time between systems.let's face it 20-30 jumps are simply boooring and when you got nothing to do afk you can only count flies on your monitor or write haiku poems.thumbs up from me!!"
3/9/2009,not supported. keep space huge.
3/9/2009,so you measure eve space by the time wasted traveling beetween jumpgates... interesting
3/9/2009,"yes because that distance is measured in kilometers or au and the size of a galaxy is also determined in km or au (most used of course lightyears).back on op post i have to say no because it would make trading between big hubs too easy for traders. if they want money they got to put an effort in it be flying around, shooting npc's or probing down plexes."
3/9/2009,space is supposed to be huge. it should take a long time to fly somewhere. that is the price you pay for moving between trade hubs. i would only support this if they charged a fee for each jump (like a toll road). 10 - 20 million isk per jump sounds fair.
3/9/2009,there's this thing called jump cloning... i hear its really good.
3/9/2009,"they do have gates linking systems 10-20 jumps away - see niarja-kaaputnen. thing is, once such gates are in place, the systems are no longer 10-20 jumps away, they're adjacent. this is one of those cases where you want something you can't have because you don't realize what you do have. also, even if you amend your proposal to be ""make space smaller"", i still disagree. space is just fine - i spend most of my time about as far from jita as it's possible to get in highsec, and it's about 25 minutes for me to get there on autopilot while afk, or more like 15 if i fly manually. space is fairly small. yeah, it's more of a pain in a slow ship, like a freighter or a plated battleship(i remember one day i flew about 120 jumps in a 3-plate, 3-trimark bs to protect from suicide gankers, took me about 15 hours), but such is the price you pay. there's no need to make space even smaller, it's not that big as is. i prefer tradeoffs existing, as opposed to just ""you should always fly the biggest thing you can"", and distance/flight time is one good way of doing that."
3/9/2009,how about a boost to fighters such that they have roughly 5% chance of warp scrambling the target. very similar to rats.thusly a carrier with 10 fighters has the chance of up to 50% of the time scrambling the target. mom with 20 fighters would have roughly a chance of up to 100% of the time scrambling.
3/9/2009,you fail at probabilities. with twenty fighters the chance of being jammed would be 1-(0.95)^20 or about 64%.aside from that it'll never happen. support is there to jam targets (you don't fly a carrier solo- right?) and if you really wanted to you can fit a jammer.
3/9/2009,erm what? jam?warp scrambler =\= ecm jamming. even though ya gurista rats do jam.yes i fail at probabilities. i didnt bother calculating it because 5% is just a random # i gave. i said up to instead.
3/9/2009,"i meant to write scrammed. woops.anyway to expand on what i said above, holding targets down is the role of support. if there's a thing carriers don't need it's an increase in their viability solo which would be the effect of your suggestion.and if you really want to tackle in a capital ship, they can already fit officer tackle mods without being crippled by grid use."
3/9/2009,please stop posting your worthless crap ideas jason.
3/9/2009,this is not a good idea sincerely since carriers are support ships and with the fighters following people around in space as it is (warping) this would overpower them. if you want your carrier to scram get a oh well... anything except a chimera and put a scram in mids.other than that i would like to see some diversity in fighters by adding new categories of fighters so we can step away from the old cookie cutter drone setup.
3/9/2009,i'd like to see a missile drone that occasionally has to dock to reload. but then i'm a sucker for realism.
3/9/2009,"im sorry jason, but i do have to agree with him"
3/9/2009,"as soon as you stop trolling every goddamn thread in this forum with your insults and your non-constructive contributions, i am sure he will likewise stop.got it? good"
3/9/2009,you honestly think that's going to work?or are you just an alt of jason... yeah... that's the ticket.how about you go back to c&p where you belong eh?
3/9/2009,"way to make false assumptions.and how about you go back to under your bridge, there's a good laddie :)"
3/9/2009,sorry... fresh out of bridges... to busy keeping the idiots away.
3/9/2009,"yeah, drake's a fairly cranky fellow, but so far as i can tell, his disagreements are legitimate and mostly reasonable. just because he expresses his opinions with a certain lack of subtlety doesn't make him a troll. jason, on the other hand, is - he's used that word to describe himself - and thus the flaming is fairly legit. i just wish he'd stop deriving so much amusement from acting like an idiot - he has reasonable things to say when he wants to, he just prefers to fool around and **** people off. sad, really. as for the idea, in case it's not obvious, i think it's silly. fighters are fine."
3/9/2009,"i am the original jason edwards flamer. i stopped. he still posts. i simply ignore him now.really, he just needs to be posting in features and ideas, but unfortunately this forum has no moderation."

3/9/2009,"in regard to fabricated killmails, there's another option they could do: digitally sign them.with a digital signature, anyone can verify the contents have been unaltered (using the public key) but only ccp could generate the signatures (using the private key), so anyone who tried to alter the text couldn't come up with a correct signature; anyone who tried to verify the signature would identify the document as fabricated.it would effectively be a seal of authenticity that the document has not been altered in any way."
3/9/2009,"first of all the op's idea has merit but unfortunately its not a idea i can support, it would mean further trafficking of info on the servers creating a addition to the work load,secondly killmails has always been a unexact science and to be fair its up to the individuals that are interested in them to post them on the various sites advailable if its stats you want ie via the insurance entity that pays out for loss of ships then im sure a statician somewhere can tell u how many ship types were killed in whatever period, but thats about as interesing watching mould grow on my coffee lolnot supported because i believe any extra exchange of info re kills and killmails will put xtra load on the system and i wouldnt vote on anything that 'may' cause this"
3/9/2009,this would be a good thing.
3/9/2009,why not.
3/9/2009,"supported. maybe something like a sky marshall skill, requires fc5, each level allows you to command one fleet"
3/9/2009,"i'm going to use a bad word now.make it consensual.i.e. player says ""i want out"", if ceo then says ""off you go"", he's gone with no waiting time.if either one for whatever reason wants out but the other doesn't let him go, he'll have to wait.insta-kick by ceo can be abused just as insta-leave can.if both agree, it's their own fault if something is missing afterwards."
3/9/2009,"if you switch corps so much that it bothers you then you're probably doing the exact thing the whole 24 hour stasis period is designed to counter/deter.not supported.while it does make a whole lot of sense it makes fleeing from a wardec way too easy. if they would change the wardec rules regarding people leaving (in favour of the wardeccer, that is) then i would surely support your idea."
3/9/2009,all missiles suck in comparison to the other weapon types for pvp.
3/9/2009,needs a fix.
3/9/2009,"if i need to move my pod afk i usually just buy a cheap frigate and an mwd. put the mwd in the f1 position, set your autopilot and tape down the f1 button. as you drop warp the mwd activates and if the cycle ends before you hit the gate a fraction of a second later it is activated again. this is the quick lazy man's afk."
3/9/2009,buying shuttles is good for industrialist bank accounts but so annoying. buying a shuttle and trashing it when you arrive to keep your assets list clean is effectively the same thing as the proposal. there are plenty of other items for industrialists to manufacture for profit.good idea and would help create a sense of realism. i would even go so far as to make it possible for a player to elect to receive a free shuttle rather than rookie ship from their insurance company.
3/9/2009,you know you can just sell or reprocess the shuttle afterward right?

3/9/2009,"i have no idea why i didn't quit when i found out about learning skills. i think i was doing them as my ""alternate"" overnight skill, while i trained more immediately useful things during the day.i don't care about getting reimbursed if they get removed. it's just water under bridge. newbies are more important than anything.furthermore, i find the comments about evemon a little off-putting. it's a great tool, but i always feel a little whenever i start playing a new game and everyone's like ""here are all the third party utilities you need to make it not suck"". when you guys wonder about people who are ""too stupid"" to use evemon, i can't help but think, ""that's me, only i'm too lazy to juggle a bunch of extra **** to go with all my games."" in short, evemon is not, to my mind, a newbie-winner."
3/9/2009,"great idea, lavista. where's the thumbs up button?perhaps a web based ballot is feasible.i would be content, for now, with voting on the csm generated wish list.each main character could be eve-mailed the link. the player logs in and votes a yes or a no on items he/she wishes to be brought before ccp by the csm.that way, others will know that not everyone is in favor of disposing of learning skills. -better hurry folks. i've trained mine and now i'm catching up to you."
3/9/2009,"so lavista you want us two steps removed from ccp now? we've got to bend your ear for even the possibility word in with the developers?ccp could get better player feedback from in-game or web based polling on hot button issues and save a bunch of time, effort and money in the process. the candidates generally have no special insight or expertise. time to drop the whole thing and listen to the entire player base, not just the pet issues of a small clique."
3/9/2009,nvm ;(
3/9/2009,good policies are good bad ones are bad.
3/9/2009,"actually i have a better idea now:you can have a policy of saying ""vote pompous!"" in every post you make. that will add irony to your post and that is even better for pr."
3/9/2009,negative.i have asked my friends and colleagues in eve to throw the occasional vote cat into their conversations :)just because i think she is awesome.
3/9/2009,geographical location triangulation: engaged...need two more hits to pinpoint source! that was a well set-out and well thought series of responses to sindi's questions cat
3/9/2009,ah yes the next election will be so much fun
3/9/2009,hello eve pplcat has come up with some other ideas for csm.cat o'ninetails > the welfare of rodents will always be a priority for catvote cat! and the server hamsters get replaced with hyper gerbils to fight lagcat o'ninetails > i support actions against isk sellers.vote cat! if you hate isk sellers ^^cat o'ninetails > black ops ships have made it onto my agenda vote cat! cat will fix itwe support every 17th of march for love day in eve too and i think its very important for making ppl in eve happy especially pirates.thats it for now im sure she will come up with more tho. vote cat and get your ideas here too =)
3/9/2009,hehe i at least have the good grace to more or less suspend csm things whilst the captain is indisposed
3/9/2009,"i think cat has outclassed your sig in horrendous-ness sorry bud.although holy ****, i just realised yours is interactive."
3/9/2009,"personally, i'll be voting for a candidate who supports policies that they think are right rather than those that they think are popular."
3/9/2009,cat 4 csm belives we're doing whats right for eve and what will make it better for most ppl. were not popular to pirates lol cuz a lot of our ideas will make it harder for them to get away with killing ppl all day and not get punished anymore. i think their sex status should keep going down and not stay at -10 so youd have people with like -200 but im sure cat has better ideas =)
3/9/2009,we aim to please lol
3/9/2009,"""yes, please."""
3/9/2009,cat disagress with you:
3/9/2009,agreed
3/9/2009,no she is just seeing what ppl think it dosent mean shes only going to bring up those things only. haha ooops stupid laptop keys
3/9/2009,let's see some of these policies then.
3/9/2009,"this pretty much sums it up - cat wants to do this for all the wrong reasons and not only has no idea what the right reasons are, but would have no way of representing anyone properly, except her little pals.also, unless cat is deliberately pretending to be an idiot, there's no way she is over 21 so this is all a moot point."
3/9/2009,"post your pic. if you have nice boobs you'll get elected no matter how dumb your ideas. no need to thank me, enjoy the holiday."
3/9/2009,"this.i also feel you don't 'get' eve at all. your incessant bleating about removing pirates from the game has become tiresome. pirates always have been and will contine to be an integral part of the game. your crusade to remove them is doomed to failure. i suggest if you want to play a game where everyone is happy and plays nicely you try a game (ironically) involving kitties. i think it will suit your playstyle and apparent level of maturity far better.there are many areas of eve which are far more in need of attention, most of which i personally doubt you are even aware of.anyway, hals und beinbruch (ingame).kras."
3/9/2009,"yeah, these two quotes sum it up nicely. cat is either:a) a proper troll who is laughing with juvenile delight because he's managed to get people to believe he's really an idiot, by, well, acting like an idiot. - or - b) a slightly educationally subnormal childeither way, cat seems to think that his way is the only way to play and that anyone playing as a pirate is playing the game 'wrong' - this attitude (at the very least) should disqualify him/her for running.and what about the age-limit of 18 or 21 - how do they check that? aren't we just humouring a silly little child who isn't even eligible for this?"
3/9/2009,my only meeting that i missed then
3/10/2009,supported. the tempest and maelstrom are both currently garbage and i'd love to have all the sp i sunk into them be worth something finally. (training t2 lasers anyway though.)

3/10/2009,"i got bored reading the op after a couple of paragraphs and would be disappointed to think whatever boring **** the op was talking about got funding from ccp.but going by the thread title, i'd say f*ck live events; in the past they have been abused and tilted towards rewarding certain groups. if the roleplayers want to pretend their real lives dont exist, let them, but ccp should spend more time on worthwhile topics such as 0.0 incentives."

3/10/2009,"i have a ""proper"" overview setup and i lose my pod whenever i fight. i run eve on a decent machine, i do not double-box, do not run anything else, etc. whatever it is about the session change, it takes long enough that someone can lock and pod you. moving the mouse over to whatever i am warping to, while right-clicking and hitting warp-to repeatedly just sucks. it's that extra five-ten seconds before i die that could be used in an attempt to overheat my repper, guns, or ab/mwd in an attempt to escape certain death. by the time your target needs to use this, you've already won, so i really don't see why you are arguing against it."

3/10/2009,"at the risk of needing fire proof undergarments, i'm going to take a stab at offering some fixes for war-deccing.1) both corps involved become locked. that is neither can add or drop members during the war - if players leave the corp of their own volition, the war target flag follows them for 7 days or until they get podded once. also, they can't rejoin the corp until after the war.2) wardec fees go up. 10,000,000 (+ 10,000,000 for every other war dec you have currently open) to declare a wardec. weekly fee of 1 isk per skill point difference between sp total of deccing corp and sp total of target corp, with a minimum of 2.5 million per week. so, if you have a 20 million sp corp, and you dec a 10 million sp corporation, it's going to cost you 10,000,000 a week. admittedly, that's mostly aimed at reducing the griefing. but if you really want to great, by all means, pay for it.3) npc bribery. both sides can bribe npc corporations to take sides. fees would be exorbitant (on the order of tens of millions) and of course the other side can out bid. suddenly, npc stations might start refusing to let you dock and shooting at you.4) spies. specifically npc spies that could be hired to report not only player locations, but ship fits, etc.5) surrender. allow one corp or the other to surrender - basically they make a surrender offer and the other corp gets to accept or decline it - they could sweeten the pot with isk or equipment, what have you.6) redecs. wardeccing the same corp within 30 days doubles all associated fees - again, this is aimed at lowering greifing.that's all i've got at the moment. it's all off the cuff - and let's face it, it's not going to change any time soon. i'm mostly just trying to offer some kind of solutions, rather than just whining about it."
3/10/2009,what corp are you in?
3/10/2009,:madprops:
3/10/2009,"now why do i suspect there is more to this thread than meets the eye?could it be the very high percentage of voters from one single alliance?could it be the curious use of language in the op?could it be the couple of incautious comments from certain respondents?could it be the timing?in conclusion i'm a bit wary about supporting this kind of motion without seeing precisely what the make up of the next csm will be. if the turnout is low and we end up with a majority of csm's from a single powerbloc the risk is that the kind of behaviour we've seen recently on caod will be given ""official"" sanction from the csm and the reputation of the csm as a viable entity would be damaged profoundly as a result.hence i'm not prepared to give my support to this motion until i see the results of the next election and i'd advise anyone on the fence in regard to this issue to hold off casting a vote likewise.i would suggest people looking to make a serious improvement in caod right now should read this topic and cast a vote there for the issue of caod spam and low standards of posting there.all the best!"
3/10/2009,"no. i agree with ccp, the csm is supposed to be dealing with in-game issues. not forums. not websites, the game: eve online. i mean, seriously, the csm is a bunch of players that signed up to be in a group of people that voice the opinion of the player base. they are not ""an oversight committee"". if they ever became that, i would fight it or quit eve. the csm is neither qualified nor voted in for that reason. why is everyone so desperate that ccp have an ""oversight committee"". they aren't a government. heck, they don't even have the biggest player base in the world. if anyone should have one, it should be wow, but i don't see anyone crying for one for them. either way, its not needed. if your so tied into this game that you feel that ccp is some sort of government that needs governing you need to take a vacation from eve. this idea is moronic and stupid and i'm frankly appalled that any csm has any support for this idea. you need a reality check. --isaac starstriker"
3/10/2009,"you two disappoint me. i didn't think it could get worse, but you two proved otherwise. at least the guy who i least respected the least didn't have a power-high. saddening. truly saddening.--isaac"
3/10/2009,"man that's a lot of words nobody cares about. does it burn you up that this topic has been up less than 24 hours and has more support than any single one of the assinine issues you raised? yes, it does. we can't all be winners."
3/10/2009,"is it just me, or is it goonswarm, and all their alts that support this? why is ccp blind to this utter bullshyte? first they ruin coad, now they turn the whole csm thing into a friking joke? you are all fools."
3/10/2009,ask ccp why they set it up the way they did. you act as if the csm has created itself.
3/10/2009,you're going to be pretty upset when this passes.
3/10/2009,"oiu...why don't you ""enlighten me"". either way, csm is fine the way it is. and to be very honest, no other game has a ""csm"" like this. we get something really unique and all we can do is complain about it. very stupid in my opinion.--isaac"
3/10/2009,"i agree, you should probably be more positive in the future."
3/10/2009,also on the fence - i think i'd like to see the mods actually cleaning up the forums before we worry about who they report to.
3/10/2009,"you seem pretty sure it will pass (wonders why),tbh i doubt anyone in ccp will agree with this (regardless as to how many of the goons/and their alts vote) as the op suggests taking the power away from ccp re the forums into the hands of players which is something i and every other person with any sense would not wish to see while the forums are treat in such a irresponsible way"
3/10/2009,"the op does not suggest taking away power from the mods. it suggests that ccp mods should be obliged to answer the csm with regard to questions concerning the inconsistent application of moderation policies and similar related issues.if you think the op is suggesting that ccp should re-instate something like the isd again, i suggest you read again. also, ask yourself whether you seriously think that any goons would ever vote in favor of such a proposal. so no, that's not what the proposal suggests."
3/10/2009,"wow, you are incredibly bitter about being irrelevant.perhaps go and post this elsewhere on your beloved, badly moderated forums, and take someone up on their offer of ""can i has ur stuff""."
3/10/2009,"i did read the op and after reading it - the word 'purview' means 'the range of operation, authority, control, concern, etc.'this means to me that the csm will have authority and control over the mods/ccp re the forums"
3/10/2009,"so, you disagree with the assertion that the moderation immunity is nonsense? there really isn't anything hidden in the language of the op that i can see. the csm, as far as i know, does not get to decide how things are run. they address ideas and, ultimately, ccp decides based off information. your suspicion is just you trying to get a rise (successful) from people by being controversial for no good reason - aka, you are trolling under the guise of intelligent discourse.if the population, as filtered through the csm, wants the forums to be moderated in a more balanced fashion (such as equally banning/gagging you and your trolls along with the trolls you respond to, for an example), then ccp should have that pressure applied to them."
3/10/2009,*makes an obvious joke to a friend**gets permabanned*yeah i'd say the mods need some oversight.
3/10/2009,supported. also permaban jade constantine.
3/10/2009,"well whether an error in the writing or not its all rather sinister and i believe theres a ulterior motive in there somewhere, and tbh you accuse me of trolling but didnt the op ask to discuss this and isnt that what im doing?oh and stop the ingame spam of mails please"
3/10/2009,the eve-o forums mods seem about as disciplined in their duties as the goon forums mods.

3/10/2009,posting on eve-o is often more enjoyable than playing the game.
3/10/2009,heavy handed moderation stifles creativity
3/10/2009,","
3/10/2009,i like this idea
3/10/2009,look at all the goonswarm alts and members posting.you all fail.
3/10/2009,quite
3/10/2009,moar support needed!
3/10/2009,"no. as current corporation rules require you to be the director of a corp, it makes sense that you have to be the director of the ""master corp"" in an alliance in order to change standings. it makes sense to me and it really doesn't need changed. also, do you really need to change it that often? i don't think you do...if you do, you (the corp/alliance) needs to be a little more ""stable"".--isaac"
3/10/2009,the point is that this doesn't have to happen. that's more of a workaround for the broken system.you havent been to 0.0 have you? they change almost everyday. in some manner.
3/10/2009,"right...the last time i was in 0.0 we had sooooo many pets going in and out....that alliance didn't need to change every hour of every day its standings. the only coalitions of alliances that needs this is curatores veritiatis alliance and friends, foundati0n and ushrakhan and friends. and guess what, they've found ways around it. (kos system) so i really do not see the need of this system. --isaac"
3/10/2009,"with amarr's t1 crystals never buring out, an amarr laser ship could go in w-space and stay in for a long time and get more loot and salvage due to never running out of ammo so never having to sacrafice cargo space for ammo like all the rest of the races. the only other ship that comes close is the drone boats but you can easily lose the drones due to the new ai of the sleepers.i recommend that t1 crystal burn out like the t2 ones do as well and increase their m3 to bring them more in line with the rest of the races of eve."
3/10/2009,"i recommend training amarr immediately, because they are clearly so overpowered you should be sure to exploit this bug before it is fixed!"
3/10/2009,"oh yeah, its great being amarr with limitless ammo and guns that are affected by every single e-war module in-game. oh and don't forget they suck cap up like no tomorrow. yeah, they are overpowered. --isaacp.s. no support"
3/10/2009,"how long do you expect to be out there before you can fill your hold full of loot anyways?btw - sleepers = cap instablity -> cap charges take up a fair bit of cargo space too, and no cap means no damage."
3/10/2009,"i do not seriously expect cargo capacity to be the limiting factor in the length of a w-space expedition - more likely causes for wrapping up are hitting the end of your w-space and having to leave, or getting your ship blown up. ammo isn't big enough to cause serious supply issues for anybody. if you think it's broken, go try it. i expect you'll be surprised. unlimited ammo hasn't made lasers broken in any other context, and that won't change here."
3/10/2009,"is to control this game by placement of goons in csm positions, and places of power thru the csm program. you can see this in action in the thread:"
3/10/2009,u mad?
3/10/2009,"meh, ccp will only really start to pay attention when their subscription revenues start to drop. once that happens, i imagine the ban hammer will start thudding with amazing regularity."
3/10/2009,"if i had a nickel for every time i heard an asinine goon conspiracy theory on the boards...well, this post would make me a nickel richer. yes, they're a big group that acts like idiots a lot. no, they're not trying to destroy the game."
3/10/2009,"ok, goon alt, i really believe you"
3/10/2009,posting to confirm that all goons are honest individuals and they offer a legit and affordable third-party contracting service.
3/10/2009,"funny, the last time i was called someone's alt, it was jade constantine's. i wish the obnoxious forum troll community would put their heads together and figure out whether my main is an alt of a goon, or of one of the most well-known and strident goon-haters in the game."
3/10/2009,well at first we had corporations. corporations started working together and then you get alliances.now we have alliances working together. creating coalitions.lets bring them into the game as a system. purely for the purpose of isk sink with the advantage of the standings and combined chat channel.move a new pet into the space. you have to get all your allies in the area to set them blue. it's just a hassle.
3/10/2009,"i agree, why not?"
3/10/2009,"no. i see no reason to. the nap thing does it already. move on, nothing to see here.--isaac"
3/10/2009,"you don't need a regulated game mechanic to make an agreement about alliances x,y, and z setting each other blue, forming shared intel channels and co-operating in operations.the reason for having alliances as an in-game entity as opposed to an informal 'coalition of corporations' is that they're required for sovereignty mechanics. unless you want some similar sort of inter-alliance mechanic (a system of ""sov 5"" regional sovereignty, for example) this suggestion doesn't really do anything."
3/10/2009,this.
3/10/2009,"stopped reading here (hahaha you know nothing about this game, dictors are still awesome, the heavy version tanks nicely but its a fat lumbering pig)"
3/10/2009,"i honestly do not know whether to laugh because the op is a troll, or cry because he isn't."
3/10/2009,"i'm pretty much going to quote drake for this. freedom of speech only lets you talk so long as what you say doesn't affect another person. just like: ""rules of freedom are like this, you have as much freedom up till you punch me in the face"". don't like it? too stinkin bad.--isaac"
3/10/2009,"actually, feel free to punch me in the face. but don't act all surprised and indignant when i react in kind. after all, freedom is a two way street."
3/10/2009,to get gagged by the gms you have to say something supremely outrageous. hence why this guy is justly angered.i'm pretty sure the gms are doing a superb job with their standards.
3/10/2009,"i hope the dev's read this, as well as fellow eve pilots.much hype was given about black ops battleships and their supposed lethality and stealthiness, in theory. the intent here is to foment some discussion for improvement, not create a smack and hack at the developers and hopefully have this get back to the developers for correction.in practice the black ops bs is extremely weak for the following reasons:1) it cannot use a covert ops cloak;2) it cannot portal jump without a cyno pilot, rendering the ship useless for most applications;3) lack of a jump portal generator fuel bay;4) too few high slots - all 8 should be available for missiles, probe launchers, portal generator or whatever.i would even add another rig slot to it, perhaps limiting this extra (or all rigs) to black ops-related functions, ecm and etc. as a balancing tool.i would also recommend making this ship the equivalent of a rattlesnake and etc., not so much on armor and shields as much as all the available slots, higher resists and etc.balancing: * limit the number of covert ops ships it can ""take"" with it and fleet with;* favor ecm and etc. over dps, but keep it at a respectable dps level for solo-ing in wormhole and 0.0 space;* make the dps dependent upon fleet mechanics and/or fitting configurations so that the ship can do well enough in wormhole space on it's own. for instance, give the pilot the option to fit out with defense / offensive rigs & fittings to counter/cancel out semi-severe dps/tank restrictions when fitted with ecm/support modueles and/or portal generator - balance it this way, depending upon configuration rather than sweeping generalizations that render the ship to expensive ""fancy paper weight"" status in the pilot's hangar.just some thoughts... no flames please."
3/10/2009,"1. - if they could use cov ops cloak it would be extremely good boat, so good, that is all everyone would fly... thus, overpowered!2. - a battleship that can just jump to where ever without a cyno or taking gates would be extremely good boat, so good, that is all everyone would fly... thus, overpowered!3. - they have said that it along with other jump capable ships will get one of these, unless i am mistaken. so let them get it done and stop asking, ""are we there yet? are we there yet? are...""4. - high slots? this is a role boat. not a ""can do everything"" boat.you should try using them as they were intended first and stop trying to do things they were not intended for. its like your asking for a jump drive, fly cloaky maurauder or something... that doesn't need cyno's or gates to get places."
3/10/2009,"the hard part about using them the way they were intended is finding other players who can compliment a black ops bs, both mechanically and logistically. i've had a sin since they first came out and have never used it, it sits in a hangar because nobody ever has either the skills or the ambition to do a black ops operation.marlona, i was talking with zorn the other day and he stated that you guys do a lot of these ops, which is cool...but rare imo. most pilots in my experience all want a ship that can do everything and it's very hard to get a group of people to actually play a role and carry out something that takes any bit of tactical planning.what i do think would be a good idea is if a pilote could drop a cloaked covert cyno beacon, which requires same skills as regular cyno to turn on, from cargo and a black ops bs could lock onto it from within 5au away and create bridge to it. would make it much easier than having the other guy specifically fitted for black ops bridge.the range sucks imo, thats it."
3/10/2009,"no. they made major ""space highway jumpgates"" to negate multiple jumps. its fine how it is and ccp has more issues than making this smaller. --isaac"
3/10/2009,ccp actually tried this before. it was horrible. then then broke down those highways for smaller highways. they are still horrible.nozh i'm pretty sure said they want to remove all the highways from eve. however this would inevitably hurt the newbs more.
3/10/2009,quoting for truth.--isaac
3/10/2009,"heh, i have respect for drake's opinions. we could do with less of jason's opinions as 99% of them are pretty much moronic and troll like. --isaac"
3/10/2009,only troll like?my feelings are hurt.
3/10/2009,"i'd like to propose one small, simple feature: the ability to lock your camera's position relative to your ship on all three axes. i'm happy without a cockpit view, but the ability to watch the world roll by in a more realistic way would be wonderful, and add greatly to the immersion for at least a few people.it should be part of the advanced camera menu, toggle-able by right-clicking on your ship, follow your ship on all three axes, and *ideally* lose the current restriction on the z-axis, though only when following your ship through extreme loops and maneuvers that take it briefly upside-down...you get the idea. you should be able to adjust the camera like normal (no snapping back to a certain spot after you've adjusted it). it should be done as simply as possible; i'm hoping for ten or twenty minutes of coding, max. but again, these are just ideals. personally i'd be happy if i can just watch the world go by from just behind and above my badger's butt and it not take the devs away from important things (like fine-tuning the ""exotic dancers"" in ambulation) for too long.whether it gets implemented or not, many thanks."
3/10/2009,"i was acctualy going to post here, then jayne from work came in and told me about her trip to go see grease, live at picadilly...why do these people talk to me?so basically i for got what i was going to say."

3/11/2009,yes.
3/11/2009,the griefing potential is endless...i totally approve.
3/11/2009,thanks for the support guys but it needs more!
3/11/2009,i support it on the following conditions...abadnoned = disbanded corp or 30+ days of inactivityonly hackable structures should be ones with something in it... that is all.
3/11/2009,"i fully 100% support the idea of assuming control of a pos that has been abandoned for a period, i have just recently found 3 and blowing up a unfueled pos is just such a waste."
3/11/2009,"there have always been 'problems' with 'abuse' of caod? what problems?seriously, if you don't like it don't read it. it has never been strong on journalistic content, and if anyone ever started putting relevant **** in there, their alliance leadership would put a stop to it because :opsec:the current fashion in caod is to openly mock how pointless it is. this at least has the advantage that nobody reading thinks they've found something important."
3/11/2009,"absolutely agree.while i feel there ought to be a place on the forums for smack talk between alliances and members of corporations, there also ought to be a place to discuss topics concerning corps, alliances, and wars in a serious fashion. and caod in its current form is nothing short of an embarrassment to ccp and the whole eve community.smack talk, placed in a forum specifically labeled as being for that very purpose, is fine. but when the whole forum starts degenerating into a cesspool that resembles the very worst of a fringe usenet group, something is wrong. and frankly, i'm a little surprised that ccp has permitted this situation to degenerate to the point it has."
3/11/2009,live event: s*x orgy party in delve be there or be squarersvp plz
3/11/2009,yes ccp please bring back live events ccp give me isk and call it roleplay thanks
3/11/2009,"i have a roleplay event idea!how about some storyline goonfleet people steal jade constatine's caod posting rights, and stash them in the station in nol, and star fraction has to take soveriengty in the nol station before jade can ever post in caod again? star fraction is a premier pvp alliance and jade knows everything about everything 0.0 related, so he'll probably only lose posting rights for a week or so until sov kicks in, right? quote this if you down!"
3/11/2009,"this looks like a good solution to this issue. on the whole support this idea, what people who keep posting against this complaint don't seem to realise is that this is a get out of jail free card for freighters, orcas and little more (most bs's won't survive a couple of bs's shooting them) - and it's specifically abused by those industrial ships and little else. if you're bouncing about in lowsec in a cruiser and you disconnect when you jump into a camp, you're going to die with or without a fix to this problem, so the average player will see no difference to their gameplay at all."
3/11/2009,"that's a terrible solution. not everyone plays the same way. i fly with a nomadic group in deep 0.0 space. we are often more than 15-20 hostile jumps from any place we can dock. we log out in space every day - because we rarely dock. it is not acceptable for ships to float around for 5 minutes after a player logs out or loses connection. for some pilots that would be the equivalent of - ""when you log out in a station your ship is ejected into space and sits there for 5 minutes."""
3/11/2009,"i agree sitting there for five minutes after you log is not a great solution (sry jimer). someone suggested a special packet be sent for a ctrl q or an esc -> quit be sent to the server to let them know they quit the game. that said the ship should be vulnerable to 30 seconds after the exit meaning even though they are not in game you can stil agro the ship with a direct fire weapon giving it a 15minute timer as it would normally if you were shot then logged out. it's not a concrete solution as a person can just unplug the motem/turn off their pc but its still better then nothing. or just simply you can be agro'd for the first 30seconds after any type of exit/dc. as it stands if you dc after a jump your dead any ways if your in a bs/sub bs most of the time. we were able to take down an abaddon that ""dropped"" right after saying bi in local with only 5 recons/hacs so."
3/11/2009,"no, you misread what i said. the five minutes applies only from the time of login and only if you log in in space. meaning that if you log in, stay for more than 5 minutes, then log out- you still vanish in 30 seconds. if you log out after 3 minutes, you stay in space for 2 minutes."
3/11/2009,"reiterating, because i obviously wasn't clear enough:* the 5 minute timer applies only to login and only if you log in in space.* if you stay for more than five minutes, there is no timer other than the current one.so for those who log out in space with no aggro after doing their regular play session for hours, nothing changes.all it means is that you can't log in and out to check local or move your warpin, because you're around for five minutes if you do. if you're not exploiting login mechanics, you're fine."
3/11/2009,"update:--------------------------------------------------------------------------smartbombs may no longer cause immunity to citadels but they are anything but fine. their explosion velocity while in siege is atrociously low at about 3.25 m/s.using the missile damage formula i obtained the dps against various capital ships at different speeds, see for yourselves:phoenix damage to carriersphoenix damage to some supercaps all stats are without implants nor rigs, in a max skilled char flying a phoenix with three bcu iis and do not include drone dps. keep in mind no matter how many bcus are fitted, the damage reduction percentage is the same. i used the phoenix as an example but the problem is with citadels and affects the nag as well, to a lesser extent.shockingly, the damage of citadels is so poor against moving targets a phoenix deals more dps out of siege to an archon, nidhoggur or thanatos moving at max speed than in siege mode, and barely less against a chimera.that's for theory - i am aware that in practice between other capitals blocking the way, the long time it takes them to accelerate and of course webs - carriers don't move at max speed for the most part, but this extreme example reveals the underlying problem: citadels' explosion velocity being far, far too low in siege mode. in fact if a carrier is flying at ~45 m/s or above, a rage siege raven outdamages it. even if the targeted carrier is triple webbed, the phoenix still loses about a quarter of its damage due to low explosion velocity. against supercaps the phoenix also loses a significant chunk of its damage, up to 64% against a moving hel and up to 31% against a leviathan - the ship with the single largest sig radius and tied for slowest capital.i realize capital turrets have to deal with tracking but they are not penalized anywhere near the extent citadels are against other capitals short of shooting one at extreme close range. if you disagree back up your claim with some facts and not just ""well turrets miss missiles always hit"".there was a time when citadels weren't just useful against caps, they could also be used effectively against battleships and some bcs but doing so either required a gimped setup or specific support and there was no flood of whine threads about how imba they were. today this is impossible, but it's not important. what is important is that citadel torpedoes as an anti-capital weapon are massively underpowered. aside from their (very) delayed damage and being destroyable they are crippled by their explosion velocity.it feels as if the devs tossed out a random number for citadel explosion velocity and went with it without testing, consequences be damned. citadels don't need a token boost, what they need is a significant increase in explosion velocity to allow missile dreads to fulfill their role in anti-capital warfare."
3/11/2009,"the numbers are correct. i don't have the experience to properly interpret them in terms of capital fights, but they look horrific."
3/11/2009,i just get a 404 for the pictures.
3/11/2009,my numbers pretty muched matched yours. as a nag pilot this is pretty concerning. supporting a boost.
3/11/2009,"i've changed host for the pics, they should be working without issues now.also: supporting my own thread."
3/11/2009,"i so plan too run the test again so i can fraps it. just as more proof.the test ran on sisi was 2 part. first we use 5 phoenix and 1 thanatosall phoenix enter siege and starting firing on the thanatos as it enter grid. at a range of around 30km by the time the first volley reach the target it had reach the speed of 50m/s, for the next 10 mins of the cycle for siege the thanatos was easily able too deal with the dmg from the phoenix crew. it took them nearly 25% of there cycle too simple down the shields.the next test used a mix of revs(2) and moros(3) dreads.now with them in siege and the same thanatos pilot upon entering grid he lost shields and some armor before gaining speed. even at the max of 90m/s the use of the armor rep was more then sparing. around 75% in too the cycle for siege the carrier was cycle both armor reps at times too deal with the dps output.something is broken here"
3/11/2009,good luck incantare!
3/11/2009,"as someone who has flown both with and against citadels, i can safely say that without a doubt this needs to be looked at."
3/11/2009,hows that working out for you?
3/11/2009,"yes, lets give in again to the goons, look how they took delve. metagamed their way in and spammed a bazillion towers up. and now they want to make it easier"
3/11/2009,"we've killed twice as many pos as we've ""spammed""and we've spent over 100 man days spamming."
3/11/2009,"we have not heard a single solid reply to why we cannot get more standing slots at corp lvl in order to be able to properly set red/blue settings on outpost access's, with the current increasing playerbase 300 is a rediculasly small ammount of corporation slots to run sutch things and even if ,for whatever reason, ccp does not wish to increase our corp slot limits to something reasonable like 5000+. then , how about changing things so that op's use the alliance lvl standings settings sutch as friend/enemy/nap/competetor since op's can only be built by alliance's anyway which is the heart of the slot limits problem. the inability to control op access's because there are far more standings that need to be set at corp vs' alliance/corp/char is most vexing. and so far we have had 0 responce from ccp on the subject and the old threads are necro locked. seerindarkness"
3/11/2009,"look ccp.every day i get some new propaganda that eve is a sand box, where players are allowed to make the game what they wish.providence wishes to decide who is red, who is neutral, and who is blue ( for pos reasons / outposts etc ). we are running out of slots.its been asked to be fixed for months if not hitting apon years.fix it. i cant imagine its more then 30 mins in the code."
3/11/2009,"additional to the previous postings, i suggest to implement a auto-cleaning function/button to choose the function, whos deleting closed corps/alliances or/and especialy a function for the personal standings of each player, to delete settings for solo characters, when they joined an corp/alliance. its pretty hard to sort that handish with just 300 slots and wastes a lot of time. but if that will come, we will still need more slots, to set our standings properly- i suggest to double the limit, so up to 600slots."
3/11/2009,"i too, support more standing slots. (combined with outposts and pos's being able to use alliance standings)."
3/11/2009,eh.. why not? supported.
3/11/2009,"already brought up in csm1. can't remember exactly what the outcome was, it's on the list with very low priority though."
3/11/2009,yes!
3/11/2009,support.
3/11/2009,this sounds reasonable.
3/11/2009,"very intelligent suggestion, thumbs up!"
3/11/2009,"the problem here is lag - too many standings means too many database lookups. that's not to say it shouldn't be changed, but it's not as much of a no-brainer as people think it is."
3/11/2009,"so, selecting any celestial object and just clicking the little box with a bunch of arrows in it doesn't cut it for you? thats essentially what you're asking for and its already there. i don't see how a shortcut for this should really be a priority.edit: in case that as at all unclear, here's a picture.please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
3/11/2009,"i like it. useful in an emergency.someone could make the argument that anything that makes podkilling harder is bad for game balance, but i wouldn't personally agree with that argument."
3/11/2009,more command keys are good.
3/11/2009,"link perhaps i am making a mountain out of an ant hill but i would like to know how much sway the esrb has over the creative choices at ccp. if mitnal's words are to be taken seriously then it would seem in order to gain the t for teen rating granted by the esrb the devs had to cut out a background setting way off in the distance of an old hanger screen.granted it is insignificant but if the reasons for its removal are in fact censorship how much of eve, both present and future will be affected by this?"
3/11/2009,i want to know this aswell.
3/11/2009,"pretty sure i remember seeing an ""unrated by the esrb"" when i logged in..."
3/11/2009,"the exact words are ""online interactions not rated by esrb."" this means interactions between players as opposed to the content that ccp produces. my concern is that, did ccp in order to get the esrb t for teen rating agree to remove certain aspects of their game and or cease pursuing those lines?"
3/11/2009,they are shown at me in the order of creation.
3/11/2009,"just tested it, and it seems you're right. guess i just created mine in alphabetical order. okay, i'm for alphabetizing too."
3/11/2009,its spelled group.
3/11/2009,when i grow bored of alliance life i tend to go into my one man corp...i then go back to my ore stealing and killing darwins..occasionally i see a corp ripe for ransoming.. 400-500m.. one man corp vs a 20-50 man corp..i dont war dec one corp at a time i war dec 3 or so if i can.begining of the week i send a email to allt he ceo's i am at war with... i then go hunting and kill anyone i can find. then send that person an email saying... blame youre ceo for not paying up.so removal of the war dec system while good for some aint good for all.if paying to war dec another corp was raised to 50-100m isk then what would war deccing an alliance cost? 250-500m isk? per week at thathell one of these days i must one man war dec an alliance lol....

3/11/2009,"if the forum is part of the game, then why is it not a function or application inside the game? besides browsing to it with the internet browser, which makes connection to the world outside eve, thus also unrealistic."
3/11/2009,csm candidates should have some purview over forum moderation. they are supposed to be looking out for the players. some of us just play forum games... not allowing them oversight is a bit disheartening that the initial csm concept has been retooled so much by ccp that it is now only a shadow of its original intent.
3/11/2009,"what you are saying is that the forum will merely end up being an extension of goonswarm's policies and serve as a political tool to achieve its goals.i see what you did there. somebody has been reading the cia manuals.we cannot give you that power, although you will seek it by other means.abulurd bonifaceme meceo"
3/11/2009,"haha, cry more man. (: this could serve just as much use to you as it would the idiots you claim.i support this idea. it serves a lot more uses than the op suggests. if you can throw it into any channel and anyone can use it, absolutely."
3/11/2009,"i like it. it's a useful mechanic, and it's balanced so that it's both useful and dangerous. basically all we're asking is to be able to place a bookmark in a chat channel. i see this having a lot of uses - in fleet/corp/alliance channels as a way of quickly distributing bookmarks, and in local as a way of sending out distress calls, planting ambushes, or being a good samaritan. anyone using the mechanic understands the risks involved.and, i'd like to point out, a person under attack sending a distress signal in local really doesn't assume any risk, - presumably, you'd only send a distress signal if you knew you were going to be beaten. if more bad guys turn up, nothing is going to happen to you that couldn't have happened already. but if good guys turn up, you might get lucky. or, even more interesting, maybe different bad guys turn up and turn it into a 3-way fight.generally, it'd be a useful mechanic to have. supported."
3/11/2009,why not? seems reasonable to me.
3/11/2009,"hello all!!!! how r u guys? im super thx 4 askin!!!!!i was wonderin y teh margin tradin' skill hasnt been fixed after all these years. teh simple fact of teh matter is that there aint no way 2 turn teh skill off. like if i want 2 buy a super special item (like maybe a titan!!!! or a polaris!!!!!) there aint no way 2 front all teh monies so i kin b sure tat teh order goes through!!!!! teh only way that i know of 2 turn off teh skill (short of no playin) is 2 relentless self destruct until my skillpoints is below 900000 but thatll take 4ever (possibly literally)!!!!!in shortthis is offensive. fix your game ccp you have to.hugs n kisses, cbs"
3/11/2009,1d10t.
3/11/2009,"you know, i've read this three times, and i still don't understand what the problem is.what about the margin trading skill isn't working? and why would you want to turn it off?"
3/11/2009,the fact that the op talks about buying a titan or polaris via the market should be a huge clue that you should not take him seriously.simply ignore this thread and it will likely go away.
3/11/2009,"hi!!!!! thx 4 readin my post!!!!!teh prob is tat the margin trading dont turn off so u cant front all teh money for an order up front if u want. in rl this wouldnt be a big prob since people is always willin 2 take monies up front so should brokers!!!!! i mean like just a little checkbox when placin a buy order sayin ""front all teh monies"" would be super!!!!!!!!hope that helpshugs n kisses, cbs"
3/11/2009,"hi!!! thx 4 readin my post!!!i do believes that titans kin be bought n sold via market but i was under teh impression that it waz just impossible to get em inside a station 2 be sold. could a dev confirm this? thx!!!!!hugs n kisses, cbs"

3/11/2009,"doesn't the eula mandate that you have to be age 13 to play? as for the issue here, i suppose i agree with the op in the abstract, but it's pretty minor. if you can afford it, it's not a problem, and if you can't then you shouldn't be buying it."
3/11/2009,as its been proven by this thread alone.... people don't care what the eula says.anyone with a credit card and some cash can play this game.i'm just surprised anyone is bothering to translate that kiddie language.seriously... if your going to post... at least post in english.at least the bulk of the ideas ive shot down spoke very clearly and where understood... i respect them more than i would this kid.
3/11/2009,"i respect you drake, even when you're telling me i'm wrong. i mean clearly that indicates you're delusional - but still worthy of respect."
3/11/2009,hey! i resemble that remark! er.... resent! errr.
3/11/2009,"i'm sorry, that made my day drake. snorted water out of my nose when i read that. to the op. tl;dr. --isaac"
3/11/2009,"if your fleet has an industrial or two with it to carry tons of potential loot, throw ammo in there. 15-20,000m3 can hold a lot of ammo.if the system you find is really awesome, you could just setup a small pos and use it for a few weeks and make ammo by mining asteroids in some of the sites if need be, granted it might just be easier to use the worm hole and haulers to fill up corp arrays with tons of ammo. if you run out of ammo then after all of that, then might i suggest cashing out on the system's spoils since you've likely got a massive amount of loot to sell/use by then, if you didn't get all blown up."
3/11/2009,uh... excuse me... do you even know how to play amarian?guess you don't... because anyone with half a freaking brain would see that they drain capacitor like crazy unless you fit them propperly... but its not cap stable that's for sure.even then tech 1 crystals are only slightly more powerful than most common tech 1 ammo... but its always about resistances.please... leave before you stench up the place.
3/11/2009,"drake, i love your posts."

3/11/2009,"is it just me that finds this typically to mean ""strip away variety and uniqueness""?"
3/11/2009,"i've fought with rails and with lasers, and it never seemed to me that unlimited t1 ammo on lasers is unbalancing. as has already been said, it sucks cap like whoa and leaves you very vulnerable to neut and nos.no change necessary. different guns have different advantages."
3/11/2009,"greetings everyone:i had a new idea for pvp: mercy missionsit would go something like this: at a certain standing, a player would have access to relief supply missions that would mark your ship as a neutral (the scanner would show a peace sign or something) and the mission only pays for a short term insurance policy on your ship. (perhaps an addition to your current policy) if someone destroys your ship during that mission, then they are marked for a longer period in hi sec space, and their standing get reduced further than for a standard kill. (other ideas?)here is the twist: after a mission is complete, you are fair game, but still carry the neutral markings and insurance for a short period of time. this could open up a whole new profession.example :bob takes a mercy mission to deliver an a**load of medicine to a colony five jumps away through low sec space. now that he takes the mission, his ship is painted with a symbol that designates him as on a peace mission. if anyone attacks him, then that person loses standing and/or an immediate bounty is placed on him.lets say that bob completes the mission, and he sees in the station a deal on some expensive items, and he can sell it for twice the price five jumps away through hi sec space.. since his neutral status and special insurance does not expire for another hour, he takes the risk and sets a course for the selling point.meanwhile, tom is gatecamped, waiting for an easy meal, when he spies bob on his way to sell the stuff he bought. he doesnt want a bounty on his head, so he lets it go.in the next system, joe is camped as well, but is broke and desparate, so he goes after the ship anyway. after the kill, he loots millions worth of stuff from the wreck.since bobs mission was over, there is no loss to joes standing nor a bounty placed on him. results:bob loses his ship, but can buy another due to the insurance and is only out on the stuff he bought at the station after the mission was completed.tom, wimped out and missed out on a big payday. joe took the risk and it paid off big.i am not a pirate, so some of the penalties may not be appropriate. please give me some feedback on this and let me know if this is something worth looking into.i think that this has potential for both pirates and carebears, and could coax more people into 0.0 space.constructive criticism please. any devils advocates please add your 2 cents as well!"
3/11/2009,intriguing idea.... but full of holes.i get what your trying to do... but the current mechanics won't permit such things.and honestly... there's not much an incentive... markets in low sec are practically a world of there own.now if said mercy missions had large rewards or something... that's different.
3/11/2009,"csm could pass it and demand ccp implement it, that doesn't mean ccp isn't going to tell them no.they stopped using non-paid staff already, why would they go back to something that would be even more limited than simply bringing back crc?"
3/11/2009,"i kinda understand the op's line of logic, being that goons are well represented in every stupid thread on these forums, spam caod at will, and even here, from the number of goonswarm led and goonswarm suppored topics.personally, it would be nice to ban them in their own entirety from the eve forums, and let them use their own forums they pay for, instead of forcing others to read the utter drivel that spews from their orfices every sad day ."
3/11/2009,hahahahahahahahahahehehehohohohohahahahahahahaheheheahahaha*gasp*hahahahahahaheheheheohohohohhohohohahahahehehehahaha*gaspcoughcoughgasp*i havn't laughed that hard in a long time.you sir.. have won the jackass of the month.congrautlations.now stfu and gtfo.yes.. goonswarm are very large... quite poweful... and full of idiots.

3/11/2009,after reviewing your carefully wellcrafted proposal i've decided to support you in your endeavors.
3/11/2009,"and as expected the goons are flaming, but keep it up girls, i am going to keep bumping this topic for the next couple years."
3/11/2009,aslong as goons continue to kill people my alliance doesn't like a im happy
3/11/2009,"it's true, you've uncovered our master plan to take over the csm and then use that power combined with the mighty nerd power of devswarm to insert malicious code into the game that instantly hacks all accounts and scams ccp of one billion rl (real life) iskand then take that seventy three cents and give it to our god-king darius johnsonall hail the god-kingall hail the plan"
3/11/2009,"your optimism, heart-warming though it is does not negate the underlying truth: eventually the swarm will come for us all.there will be no survivors.abulurd bonifaceme meceo"
3/11/2009,"you realize that even if goons get 2 people onto the csm, they will still be in a vast minority. it could even...gasp...work against goonswarm. think before posting! (who am i kidding, this is the internet)"
3/11/2009,"so, they've had people on the csm every time, which wasn't a problem. they claim they'll take over the csm with each new election, but afterwards it's just all about the whine threads it'll spawn, like this one.don't take it serious and don't give it attention."
3/11/2009,we control your posting now.
3/11/2009,"why is it that eve makes having alliances really useless? i mean like with pos's. if the alliance are the ones who hold sovereignty why is it the pos's that are set up alliance use don't work for the alliance? we are given the option and it means nothing. alliances can not use ship maintenance bays, corp hanger arrays when set to alliance, nor can the alliance take control of pos guns. seems to me that alliances in eve are truly restricted and pointless. i understand the issues with protecting corp assets but if the alliance agrees to operate in the same areas we can not share things as a alliance. i look at real world alliances and they share not just info but equipment and duties. can anyone help us understand the whys to giving us the options yet they don't work. i think it would be nice to actually work like a alliance not just fly together, just like in empire a alliance is pointless as well. you can not help defend a corp in your alliance. a alliance is no better then a nap.kaila"
3/11/2009,hey all!!!!!i totally agree!!!!! its just 1 big monies sink!!!!! i think we should totally let alliance members have more control over posses or we kin let corps take sovriegnty!!!!!
3/11/2009,anyone speak druggie? i think he's overdosed on space crack.op: your question has some valid points... but the approach is wrong.you should spend some time talking to alliances who deal with this on a daily basis before making conclusions.
3/11/2009,"just saying, they kinda suck balls. perhaps - i dunno - make them useful again? you know, like you said you would, nohz."
3/11/2009,1up
3/11/2009,"well yes they do suck. whilst there have been numerous threads on the plight of the bomber, i cant recall anybody promising to buff it........ perhaps now ccp have put in some new content they could spare a couple of bods to fix some of the things they broke - bombers and black ops to name but a few."
3/11/2009,"tbh bombers have always sucked imo not really good at anything including their rolebombers do need to be looked at, although im not sure exactly what role but the bombs need to do more damage and the mechanics of launching a bomb needs to be looked atorbring back 'mines' now i know this is a seperate subject but can we maube incl the bomber as a mine layer as well (sort of incorperating a dual role) so yes i support the propsal of bombers being looked at"
3/11/2009,"bombers were very good at their niche roles and if you used the right tactics and patience were very effective at their job. bombers do need to be looked at, although im not sure exactly what role but the bombs need to do more damage and the mechanics of launching a bomb needs to be looked ati think bomb damage is fine atm but i agree the mechanics need revisingorbring back 'mines' now i know this is a seperate subject but can we maube incl the bomber as a mine layer as well (sort of incorperating a dual role) bombs, missiles and mines? too many roles for this shiptype.my solution is a bonus per level to cruise missile explosion velocity and the ability for bombs to continue to their target even if the bomber is destroyed or warps away."
3/11/2009,"letting bombs continue on their way to the target is a definite, but i don't think the stealth bomber needs any boosts to the damage it can cause with cruise missiles. it works fine as it is.the idea of a bomber is to come up on a target cloaked, decloak, drop a payload, and then either warp away or cloak again before anyone can attack you right? if the bombs dissapear when doing so it kind of defeats the purpose.supported, minus the explosion velocity bit."
3/11/2009,"whenever you open up info on something or someone it will automatically open up one of the info tabs, which can be handy but also very annoying. if it decides for instance that the standings tab is the default one this time and you check info on a corp it'll take a bit to load, which takes time, slows down the client and taxes the database... for no reason. this is also the case for other tabs ofcoure but the standing one is the most annoying. you could ofcourse set a certain tab to always be the standard one but i think it would be much better/easier/faster to show no info at all till the player actually clicks one of the tabs (the one he's actually interested in).as said, it causes less lag and there will be much less pressure on the database because of it. no idea how many times someone checks info on something but it must run in the bazillions, if that means the db has to be queried twice as much because the info screen opens on some random tab (or the one the player isn't interested in at that moment) that surely will help a lot."
3/11/2009,having read the excellent explanation the op gave i'd like to subscribe to his newsletter and also want to have his babies.
3/11/2009,"this isn't an ideal solution - a lot of times i want to see the same screen on each of a number of modules, and this would greatly increase the work needed to do so - but you have identified a real problem. the current system of opening the fourth tab if the fourth tab was the last one open last time is pretty bad, and yields a lot of unnecessary frustration. a better memory for what tabs we want would be good."
3/11/2009,it took waaay too long to implement.
3/11/2009,"and this is in the assembly hall....why exactly?i mean i am sure they appreciate the feedback, but let's put it in the feedback section, shall we?"
3/11/2009,i'm sorry... cant hear you over the violin music playing in the background.
3/11/2009,glad you are enjoying the skill queue but this thread has no purpose.locked.
3/11/2009,wow jason you have put a half decent idea on the forumsi will have to give you support just for that.
3/11/2009,"as much as ai hate bumping... its an sactioned game mechanic by ccp...if it were otherwise we would have ships passing through each other, not a nice look.. lol..but yeah as others have said. if you cannot tank the mission lvl dont do it."
3/11/2009,"i can not ever see t3 being any ware near the price of t2, the effort vs reward when the production stage hits in going to be unbelievable. anything involving a gang to do complexes means every one wants there 100mill for the hour of plexing, and currently you can not even think of doing a sleeper complex with less then 6-10 people who really know what there doing. add on top of that the cost to start up production and the skill reqs and i think a lot of people now get the picture.so i still feel that t2 should be as dynamic as t1 or t2 now is. well take that back, t1 is static and dynamic in that belts have yet to be taken out of the game so it has the best of both worlds, t2 is static only with moons, and t3 is now full dynamic."
3/11/2009,this would be awesome. i would scoot around jettisoning lag clouds all over the place!! i approve!
3/11/2009,you lost me at the gigantic wall of ****ing text.and i wish you could be gagged until you learn to properly use the enter key.
3/11/2009,now i'm falling in love with your posts.
3/11/2009,go back to your corner jason.... your better off making random ideas.
3/11/2009,"no, shut up, go to ure corner throll :)on the serios note u mite see this diferently but eve dose have a large comunity that involves many classes of ages...in the official channel words that are considered obsene internationaly...like f**k or d**k..are and should be banned...but words like ""kill"", murder etc etc can not be banned .to understand what im taking about read here:"
3/11/2009,1. learn to speach2. join the monks since ur into enligh****evercrap3.this is a game ccp have to consider children playing and people who are against insults and swearing so they have to take drastic measures and since it is against there rules to swear or be abusive to new players then by all means id say kick ya from channel :)

3/11/2009,well you are forgetting one thingwith attribute and learning skills you elimanate implants making them plain and boring and not really worth what you pay for
3/11/2009,why wold you remove an option?
3/11/2009,"there seems to be some really vast oversimplifications being made in this thread, many of which are based on assumptions or pure speculation.in real life i wouldn't even consider not voting. it's not only one of our most important freedoms, but it's the civic responsibility of every person that lives in a democratic nation.but i did not vote last time in eve. even though i find the concept of the csm fascinating and applaud ccp for what it is attempting to do, i still didn't vote. and it wasn't because i felt the csm would be ineffective or anything like that.the primary reason i didn't vote is because this out-of-game political experiment is still in its infancy and the process has not yet matured into something where the average eve player can see a tangible outcome from their vote.let me use american politics as an example. the differences between the two major political parties in the us are pretty well known and their party platforms well established, thus voters are really voting for issues when they cast a straight party line vote (and the vast majority of voters do vote straight ticket, meaning all democrat or all republican).there is nothing like this in eve. so when i vote for john doe for csm, what can i expect to see as a result? anything? there is no clear or established party platform because there are -- at least so far -- no political parties in the csm. which in turn means it's up to each candidate to enunciate a clear vision of where they stand on important issues and what their priorities will be if elected. and no disrespect meant, but most candidates have done a very poor job in this regard. most eve players simply have no idea what the candidates stand for or even where to get information about them.darious johnson, as strange as it may sound to some, is actually slightly ahead in this regard. now people will say he is doing nothing more than being an advocate for the goons and attempting to use the csm to further his alliance's goals. perhaps. but the point is, he has a real constituency and they have a pretty good idea where he stands on issues and where his priorities are. i'm neither endorsing nor criticizing his positions, i'm merely pointing out that he has an established platform of sorts and people have a good idea of what they can expect from him as a csm member. he's visible, and that counts for a lot in the world of politics.i'm sure the other csm members have strong opinions, too, but i think it's fair to say most people don't know much about them. this tends to turn eve's voting process into little more than a personality contest. and if that's all it's going to be, i have serious doubts it will mean much beyond being a sounding board for ccp to bounce some ideas off of.if the csm is ever really going to mean anything to the average eve player, and i think it would be great if it did, then communication will have to get a lot better and players will need some mechanism to know what to expect from candidates. even if most players were confident the csm's recommendations would have real weight with ccp and stood a good chance of being implemented in a timely fashion, the current system makes it unlikely there will be a large voter turnout. people just don't see any point and don't know what or even if they can expect anything in reuturn for their support."

3/12/2009,"please return the effect of the cyno jump that was before apoc. one of the joys of capital ships was the blinding light, the bang of the warp portal opening up and the woosh as you fly through, and hot dropping on people. or a titan dropping out; the blinding white light. all that stuff was awesome. now its meh."
3/12/2009,"totally agree, wanted to showoff to a friend... but is was kinda disappointing... old capital ship jump effect is nicer then the new one"
3/12/2009,"i agree to a certain degree.. i think all ships should maintain the current jump animation ""however"" i think capitals should also show the directional wormholing effect like before. currently gates dictate jump direction and the rest of the effect for subcaps, so the capitals should get their jump ""direction"" via the original effect + the current one. additionally it would be nice if the entrance/exit of the jump caused effect of the actual ship directional movement.. but if not possible.. then the effect needs to be originally projected on the ships facing direction and then locked on coordinates, regardless of if the ship swings so you don't get the swinging gate effect if it gets bumped on entrance and exit."

3/12/2009,"now i feel bad about having started a thread in the other board.this has my support.cruise missiles:- they do have lower dps than turrets- they do even less to the vast majority of targets (frigs / cruisers)- they have a counter lowering their dps even further (defenders)- they are still of no use in pvp (torps have their... users)- they are expensive - and you need more of them to kill the same targets.- they have a low rof.torpedos:- they don't even hit battleships for the damage listed.............editas for the ""no tracking worries"" argument:missile boats cannot work transversal velocity to compensate. i know why i fly vargur and sold the golem, really i do."
3/12/2009,and ban goons too
3/12/2009,agreeing with this.
3/12/2009,"caod does need cleaning. maybe even its purpose re-defined, or a 'troll sectioon' created for the bull**** that is posted there."
3/12/2009,i've done this personally in a thanatos vs nagfail and pheonix. i cant attest to the skill levels of the pilots. however ya. pretty much anything moving at any speed can speed tank citadels. it is a fact.should this be fixed? certainly not.at the same time i'm doing this. the nagfail's projectiles cant track at all.the problem consists entirely in allowing the carrier to move. it should have 5 webs on the thing.
3/12/2009,"what i do support though is tech 2 ammo and guns for dreads.citadels get the uber dmg, short range type. also the high precision who can hit the faster moving things.also equivalent for the rest of the dreads."
3/12/2009,thumbs up in support
3/12/2009,"the nagfail suffers from the cid effect too. on top of that i am talking about a cap battle. more then 1 vs 1 here. and not only just vs caps. a moros can fight sub-cap ships and kill something. it guns might miss a lot but if it lands a hit it counts for something, on the other hand. you can fire cids all day. but if you only deal 80 dmg with all 3 then your not going too kill anything.telling pheonix pilots too fire webs and such too make there cids worth while like amarr ships too use projectiles weapons as there cap issues with lasers."
3/12/2009,this is simply not true outside of very close range as i said in my opening post. but rather than ask you to take my word for it again take a look at these graphs of various dreads firing at a full speed thanatos.with 50% of speed contributing to transveral.with 100% of speed contributing to transversal. all have one t2 damage mod except for the phoenix which has three; closest range faction ammo was used in all cases. drone damage and the nag's citadel damage were not included in the graphs.the curve corresponding to each weapon is as follows:blasters - pinkacs - greenpulse - tealbeams - yellowrails - bluecitadels - redfrom a single glance it should be obvious that there is something very wrong with citadels as they are.

3/12/2009,what the **** is wrong with you?
3/12/2009,if the slots cannot be increased due to lag issues then i would aprecate consideration of linking the alliance standings settings to outposts so that useing the corp lvl settings isent needed and we could generaly clean corp slots of the settings and reduce the db lag even more since the corp slot settings of the controlling corp for the op's are duplicate settings in 99% of them anyway. the issue of a self cleaning standings is a seperate issue tbh but i dont understand why closed corps/alliance's dont self clean in the first place in order to reduce db lag. seer
3/12/2009,"oh, i agree. i don't know enough about the system to know what exactly the problem is and what the best way to work around it is, but i'm sure there's some system better than the current one, and i'd love to see them implement it. i agree with you, i just figured it ought to be explained."
3/12/2009,lovely
3/12/2009,do want. it's common knowledge that the best micromanager will always be the player but if npc ai gets smarter than drone users should be cut some slack as well.
3/12/2009,"a new command key wouldn't make you warp faster though, would it? i don't see how, the same packet would be sent to the server at the same time.and your issue with always getting podded because of session changes is a user issue, not a game issue. most experienced pvpers never get podded unless caught in a bubble."
3/12/2009,"in eve you are only allowed to train one character on an active account concurrently. i think eve is the only mmo that restricts one in this fashion.to achieve this end people would previously use multiple accounts and take advantage of ghost training. i propose that we be allowed to train all characters on an active account concurrently. they can even lie and say it's a bug that took them years to identify and fix, if they wish."
3/12/2009,i support this great idea!
3/12/2009,"no. name another game where you can train 2 characters on the same account at the same time.... i can't think of one. in most other games you only gain skills/experience while logged in and actively playing, and you can only log in one character at a time. so again - no."

3/12/2009,"cloaking can be quite an advantageous but boring aspect of the game. i want to propose a fun and interesting way to counter cloaking but at the same time not ruin cloaking.in modern naval warfare submarines are the silent service much like cloaking is to eve. these ships hide from radar or sonar, unseen in order to spy, pry or poke as they please.to counter submarines, navies have anti submarine warfare ships and helicopters. some ships are designed specifically for this purpose to assist bigger fleets or convoys.my idea is to take that naval strategy and dynamic put it into eve for even more interesting game play. for example, just as stealth bombers are designed specific to carry bombs (no other ships can afford to carry them) or battlecruisers are designed to carry command modules , modules that would cost far more powergrid on other ships. well the same can be done for acw modules on frigates and destroyers so that those ships have specific duties in a fleet ontop of ones they already can fill.have a fleet to move? want to protect against scouts cloaking and shadowing your movement? bring a acw fitted destroyer or frigate that can scan the area for cloaked ships.this will also make things a bit more dangerous for cloakers, however if a cloaker gets scanned out only the acw destroyer/frigate will see the cloaked ship blinking.bigger ships can fit acw modules but it should cost them tons of power because they are not designed for acw activities and fitting for such would be a waste. in this way frigates and destroyers are the fast acw boats mimicing naval strategy and just providing more game strategy options. once the acw ship spots a cloaker it can go uncloak it or sit ontop of it and fleet can warp ontop of it.lets say there are a couple cloaking scouts around your system feeding intel to the enemy. in eve cloakers can camp a system for 23 hours and you may never know if they are a threat or afk. cloakers can go afk and cause stress for an entire system.well with acw, fleet commanders and system owners can do something about it if they employ an some acw ships.acw ships scatter throughout the system and start pinging for cloakers. doing so would be similar to using a scanner or prober to find ships. the caviot being that once acw ships ping for cloakers, there is a chance cloakers can tell they are being pinged for. the acw destroyer does not break the cloak of the enemy ship but it can see the cloaker and can warp to or speed toward it if the signal is strong enough. at that point a fast acw shipthis also opens up doors for more types of missions, lets say you are given a mission by an npc agent to use an acw ship to find a menacing cloaked ship in a system. lets say also acw equipment can also double for finding worm holes and plexes too? that way acw ships become very versatile, useful and interesting ships to fly. hmm but perhaps acw equipment will be expensive to be effective? not sure how you balance the cost/use part yet, any suggestions?so i thought this might be a new and interesting addition we could have for the future if the opportunity provides. thanks for reading, see you in game o/"
3/12/2009,"do not want this. i don't feel there's anything wrong with cloaking mechanics, and won't feel there is until the day comes i can fire while cloaked."

3/12/2009,raise idiot taxes!
3/12/2009,"i have a story i want to share with everyone.there once was a carebear corp that that got it's first wardec. in their first war, they took many casualties, and ended up surrendering for 200 million isk.it was agreed the corp would never surrender again.the corp recieved another wardec a month later, but the corp had prepared. this corp gathered intel, studied pvp setups, and were sure to train skills needed for the fight.then their first war started. the enemy were greifers, failed pvp'ers of 0.0 who liked using t2 ships and faction equipment. the little corp that could had fewer skillpoints, cheaper ships, but they had the numbers and were fighting in their home territory. the fight started, but the exact events are lost. what is known for certain is that this little corp held their own, and ended up bankrupting the enemy into ending the wardec.this same thing happened several more times, all with the same outcome. the little corp that could held their own, despite their losses, and have matured into tough combatants.i'm in that corp.about war decs: war decs help your balls drop as an eve player. pvp is like sex in eve. your first time is really messy, but once you get good at it...oh baby! :)if anything, i wholeheartidly support war-decs, even greifing wardecs used to annoy people. it will toughen you up.too many people who play eve at the moment are scared of losing ships. what these scared people need to do is gather intel on pvp setups, get a stockpile of parts, mission loot is really great for this, and then get there stuff together when the time comes.seriously, quit cowaring. people that wardec in highsec are usually not big-bad megacorps. they are usually smaller corps with old, bored players who just want to kill you for the lulz."
3/12/2009,i tend to agree with previous post.except for some parts... but never mind that.war-dec'ing tends to be a griefing tool... because there's no real incentive to it other than greifing.there's only 3 solutions to that problem under current mechanics.get tougher and expect more to come.join an alliancequit and join a larger corp... or move to 0.0 were 90% of the war-decing corps are utter cowards and refuse to grow a backbone.this is unacceptable... my corp never wanted to get involved in alliance... hell we wantted to do our own.of course we are very happy with our alliance... we just had ambitious plans that never came to fruition due to the interference of war-dec.

3/12/2009,"my main man left me for a wormhole (not to be confused with a scummy exotic dancer). for the past two days he is stuck in an unknown system. he is a good scanner pilot and found the wormhole minutes after the upgrade. however, after waiting till end of day, enough ships passed through it to cause it to be unstable, so much so, that when he jumped through it, it collapsed behind him trapping him and a corp mate.he loves the new game mechanics and even his current predicament is funny to him. he continues to scan for a way out but there is some evil. he has found a system that is super full of roid belts and worm holes are mixed with that class. additionally, there is no way of knowing if there is a wormhole at all. thus he keeps scanning finding only more belts, gas clouds, and stations guarded by sleepers.on the first day there were pilots from other systems not just his so that meant there was more wormholes. but after they all closed, other pilots were killing themselves to return home.on the second day (yesterday) he scanned for about 6 hours, finding nothing but more roid belts. the issue is that there should be at least an indicator that a wormhole exists someplace in the system. no it should not tell you where, it should not even hint location, but just a binary yes/no like the original system scans could do for bases. just a simple (there is hope today) yes, or (sit back and enjoy your cell) no would not be a big whoop to game mechanics and would do much to reduce the frustration. the issue is a simple mechanism that exists, there is a wormhole, there is not a wormhole would not negate the need to still search the 37+ roid belts to find it.whine callers: yes he could destruct pod out, yes he could of stayed home, yes he understands the risk of wormholes."
3/12/2009,sounds like the ultimate pvp'ers/pirates type of area.sorry... but honestly... i don't see a problem with this.you go for riches and glory...expect risk.it's expected for people to overwhelm these wh systems...i'd say give it a week when the attention tapers off and people figure it out.
3/12/2009,"pretty much what he said. ccp doesn't need to change the current mechanics. its fine, you'll figure it out. or you just won't explore w-space. it was never meant to be safe or easy.--isaac"
3/12/2009,"i got trapped in a wormhole yesterday, found its replacement within 20 minutes, a hole i'm pretty sure didn't exist before we collapsed the other one. came out 31 jumps from home, but it was still highsec. i'm pretty sure that every wormhole system has a way out to *somewhere*, you just need to find it. i agree that it's a major pain winnowing out the gravimetrics to find the wormholes, but from my(limited, of course) experience with wormholes, there is always a way out."
3/12/2009,you kids had it easy.. now its time to really play the game.bout time something came along to disrupt the status quo!wh ftw!
3/12/2009,i think he means there is an issue figuring out which of the signatures you find is the wormhole.i have seen this before when i was probing. sometimes the system is just loaded with stuff. having to narrow down which one is the wh is a serious pain in the arse. if you get unlucky you could be there for hours trying to finagle which one is the one you want out. there are time sinks and there is needless tedium all the while your mates are griping at you about how long it is taking while they sit there.while i am all for keeping it not ultra simple i think some improvement could be made here. some way to be able to sort and remember which stuff you've sorta found from which you still have to scan and so on. there still should be some skill to it of course.
3/12/2009,"first - tell your mates to stop sitting around go make some isk while you look! second - heck no this should be kept very difficult. if an exploration team sets of into the ""unkown"" there should plans and preparations for not neccessarily being able to easiliy find the way back home or further in. we should expect to sometimes be stuck for days in a wormhole system looking for a good way to move forward/backward/onward. it's the freaking unknown - it should not be like getting in and out of a mission or a deadspace."
3/12/2009,this.read the backstories....for those tl/dr idiots = the pioneers of new eden never had it this easy... they had to struggle to build those fancy stargates.quit your griping... get to work.
3/12/2009,"well, we just went in to check it out and my mates were in throwaway ships and got owned (we pretty much expected that, no biggie at all and had fun checking things out). as a result there was really nothing they could do but sit there. and i agree this should not be simple like warping to a gate. i am not suggesting some big flashy sign on the map proclaiming a wormhole is there.unless you have experienced this it is difficult to explain. really you need to try it and personally face this issue to have a feel for it.i am all for keeping the overall mechanic. what i would like to see would be something akin to pushpins on a map that the player can put there for themselves. so, when you narrow down a sig and it says what it is you can note on your map that ""grav site"" is there. then go scan down something else. once you leave the system (or logoff) all that info is erased.that keeps the overall mechanic in place which is fine but allows the prober a better sense of what he's already found so he can continue in a more careful manner."
3/12/2009,"that sounds like a freakin dream. no players for days on end. he should've brought a pos. maybe freightered in some fuel.next time i got through a wormhole, i'm going in there with a few iteron v's with gear for a few months worth of a stay!!!!!!"
3/12/2009,i agree but sooner or later you will want to leave and bring your loot back.
3/12/2009,hate to say it... but there's this thing called bookmarks.warp to site... drop a bookmark... and move on.it's not that hard of a concept.yes there's alot of stuff... but you have to explore... it's not supposed to be easy.
3/12/2009,"you cannot warp to anything till you have probed out its exact location at which point it shows on your map anyway. thing is you usually know what type of sig it is (wh or grav or radar or whatever) before you nail it 100%.so, as you would have it, despite knowing the sig you just found is not the one you want we are supposed to spend more time nailing it 100% so we can actually note that we found it. why does that make sense? why is it unreasonable to move along to another sig once you have done enough work on one to know it is something other than you want? note you still have to do the initial legwork at least to get a clue as to what the site is and i am fine with that. i just see no reason to spend another 5 minutes (or whatever) on each pinning it down to 100% when i already know i do not care to go there."
3/12/2009,allright... i was unaware of the nature of scanning down sigs to that degree.but another 5 minutes is not going to destroy the world either.this is supposed to be a challenge.concord did issue a very stern warning after all.^_^
3/12/2009,5 minutes is no biggie but it is 5 minutes if you are good and/or lucky. can be more. now consider you may have a dozen or more sigs on your list to deal with. with some bad luck you can easily push an hour or more. particularly if you find yourself probing out something you already probed but did not nail to 100%.eta: again this is something you really have to experience for yourself to get a sense of it. grab a probe ship and zoom around hi sec till you find a system with a dozen or more signatures in it (you can determine that on a first scan easily). now set yourself the task of finding the wormhole and you'll soon see the issue. it is very frustrating.
3/12/2009,everyone starts somewhere... eventually you'll get it down to a system.again... i get what your saying... but you need to understand something... my perspective has been altered by the fact that everyone has had it easy... and with the introduction of wh space.... now there's a stark contrast.i expected people to react negatively to it.i suggest you give it some time before you cast judgment on the mechanics.
3/12/2009,"fwiw i love the new probing system. really...i think it is a huge improvement to how it was and makes it interesting now. i am not complaining overall and if you'll note above i pretty much want it left unchanged. i just want a mechanic that allows me to know which things i have already worked on and which i haven't.keep it as it is mostly though (well, a better method [ala homeworld i think] to rearrange probes would be nice too but that is minor details...not fundamental mechanics)."

3/12/2009,"yeah, i have to agree with drake. sure, there are coalitions, but there isn't ""2-4"". it only seems like that because bob just got steamrolled by all of eve online. (which yeah, it sucks, but its life and we all move on). there are many alliances that hold their own ground without conforming to these ""3-4 alliances"". such as:cva (sure they have friends, but it doesn't include bob or goonswarm)many alliances in npc space. sure, they don't own space, but the will/have. pandemic legion operates on its own. many, many more.so no, its not one coalition of alliances. right now, the game mechanics just don't support one coalition of alliances. (eve is too big and too small for this). right now, its very possible to operate on your own. you just can't be huge when you start. (hint: start small, then expand.)so no support.--isaac"
3/12/2009,i'm quite sure there are hidden agendas and political discussions you are totaly not aware of between smaller alliances.it's in everyone's best interest to take on the bigger power blocs...because they can do one thing they cant.... build super caps.and that's a strong motivational kick in the pants.
3/12/2009,thread has derailed into trolling and off topic replies.to the op - please feel free to use the skills section of the forums to talk about skill related issues. i would suggest that you post in proper english if yo do not want your thread to go off topic.locked.
3/12/2009,"t2 bpo's only provide an advantage in that for the quantity of stuff that can be produced for them (a tiny fraction of the demand of the entire market), that stuff has a lower cost of production than invention.you see, a t2 module bpo can produce about 1,500 items per month. if you imagine how many sensor booster ii's are sold per month, then you can see that the market 'controlled' by the bpo's output is a tiny fraction. if, for example we are talking about ecm burst ii's, then the demand for the item is less than the bpo's output.so what bpo's do is ensure is that crappier t2 items are seeded on the market at near to cost price regardless. does the bpo owner make a lot of money here? no, because the entire output of the bpo isn't being produced or sold, and there's no invention going on because it's a waste of time/isk for an inventor to bother with that item.what invention does is bring volume to the supply of the market, and why you will always find that sensor booster ii available almost everywhere. is the t2 bpo owner making a lot of money manipulating this market? no. he's making a little more profit margin than the inventor, but he couldn't possibly control the market even if he wanted to, since he doesn't have enough volume to affect it.don't think a t2 bpo is an ""i win at making isk"" button. it's as much a curse as a blessing....so it's a balancing act. t2 bpos and invention work with and against eachother at the same time. don't get rid of them, as they actually provide a net advantage to the market."

3/12/2009,i'd like to bring up the pos fuel pellet idea.
3/12/2009,"hi,i am posting not because i want or need missiles to work properly again - i am happy running missions in my vargur - but looking at my ancient navy raven i was wondering:what are cruise missiles good for nowadays?- they do have lower dps than turrets- they do even less to the vast majority of targets (frigs / cruisers)- they have a counter lowering their dps even further (defenders)- they are still of no use in pvp (torps have their... users)- they are expensive - and you need more of them to kill the same targets.- they have a low rof.so. this being said. i would like a thought being spent on the primary weapon of caldari ships: the cruise missile. the weaponsystem that does not work without rigs and/or painter.now, it's true that artillery is low in dps, too. but who needs artillery in times where ac's can operate in the interesting range (up to 50km) without trouble? just another issue of a weapon-system.i have tried many a thing to get my raven-hull to even work close to the efficiency of a gunship. not even the golem gets close. it's... a waste of really expensive ammunition. this being said its a plain statement that from pve point of view:mael >= apoc > hyperion > ravennavy apoc > navy mega > navy tempest = navy ravenvargur = paladin >= kronos > golemthats just due to there being no - no - pve battleship-sized missiles that work. actually i'd say that nighthawk > raven because it can hit cruisers. simple as that.there are some options:a) cruise missiles get tuned to work at least against cruisers again (pvp problematic?)b) missions get redone (less frigs/cruisers)c) you are happy with the way things are and missiles will go the artillery way. (please switch golem to guns then)"
3/12/2009,i would never change my navy raven for any other tier1/2/3/faction bs when it comes to missions....and i am not even caldari specced.
3/12/2009,"fact is that the socalled balancing has virtually unbalanced a lot.caldari is a race that is mainly missile based, but with the current changes these same missiles have become pretty void in pvp.example 1: an interceptor sees a gunboat and decides to go tackle him. he wont go straight at him if he's at range because that would be quit suicidal, thus he has to move in a more eliptic manner. thus increasing the time to get into warp scramble range.now that same interceptor see a missile boat. does he have to think about turret tracking? no he doesn't.and if he speeds up enough he can just go straight at the target because his speed will decrease the incomming dps from missiles somuch that it isn't even hard to tank that.thus a missile boat will be warpscrambled faster because of the less traveltime.however if something like a torpedo or cruisemissile hit's an incomming ship frontal it actually should be more like ""damn that thing is allmost the same size of my shi... splut""yes a targetpainter is nice to use, now here comes another thing into play however.a targetpainter is a midslot mod, and guess where the main part of caldari defence is based at?yes it's midslots because caldari are shieldtankers.well go use drones then people say.now here comes another point. the caldari state saw this gallente plan to decrease the damage done by their missiles and the need for more drones so they made sure all caldari ships now had a tad more dronebay so they actually could use drones a tad more effectivly.this last line was purely fictional since we all know we didn't get any more dronespace.a rokh has a 50m3 dronebay. if he get's warpscrambled and deploys drones a few small frigate sized ships can take those drones out faster then he can set them onto a target, which leaves him completely helpless.give the caldari ships a bit more dronespace to rebalance a bit and let missiles also insta hit instead of traveling and traveling and by the time they actually hit they might just have been miss due to the speedtanking of the very low explosion velocities of nowadays."
3/12/2009,"vuk lau - try autocannons - i dare ya.and i still stand at: cruise missiles and torpedos are the only weaponsystem that require 3 lows, 1 med and 2 rigslots to work. they work 'ok-ish' then."
3/12/2009,"with new expeditions to w-space and the lethality of the sleepers vs drones it would be very useful if there was a way to replace drones from cargoholds.it should be a non combat operation. something like deploying a pos structure maybe.select drone from cargo hold, select deploy to space, packed drone icon appears in space. you have options to unpack or scoop to hold. if you select unpack the drone open up like a structure, you get a countdown timer (5 minutes) till when you can scoop to drone bay. allow 1 drone to be unpacking per level of drone interfacing skill."
3/12/2009,moved to features and ideas
3/12/2009,"something like this would be usefull, dunno if it should be unpacking or what, but this way you would not be able to do it in the middle of the fight (as it should be) and it would take a while, but in long expeditions it would work well."
3/12/2009,"i don't even think it needs to be a whole multistep process. just make it take about 10sec like loading more ammo.read eve chronicles: the vampire and notice how the drone was laying in his hold, and with a few buttons it was out in space. it didn't take an act of congress, it didn't take an orca's maint bay... and yet ccp keeps writing all these wonderful stories and yet boning the players with game mechanics."
3/13/2009,yes please.
3/13/2009,do it
3/13/2009,yes please change font ccp it's such a small change but would be a huge benefit to all of us

3/13/2009,"supported. well thought out ideas rather than the usual ""buff minmatar nerf caldari and amarr"" comments.i love the tempest, it's upright, it has sails, it looks and feels cool imo but it's so hard to try and make it work better than either the phoon or the maelstrom.let's just hope the designers listen."
3/13/2009,"i like the boost bonus on the maelstrom myself and it makes level 5 considerably more appetizing for mini bs, but good to look at the tempest for sure, a little grid would go a long way, or perhaps a fallof bonus and a 7.5% dmg or rof bonus"
3/13/2009,unfortunately this is the sad truth. ccp keeps trying to expand the game and add new cool features rather than of making sure that current features work well and make sense.

3/13/2009,"so far there has been a titan dd attempt on sleepers, and motherships in wormholes confirmed.... so i do not know where you get your information from.as for the dd fix, it actually points them in line with their original concept. massive effects to fleets especially in a focused area w/o being the 1 touch i win.think of it this way if a bs has 8 guns and a dd goes off with the heat damage proposal only... on average it will lose nearly 2 guns from 1 dd... multiple dd remove multiple guns.... add that to bubbles on a fleet and drones being killed with damage from the dd and you have a virtually defenseless fleet, ripe to be smashed by your smaller fleet. add in the other effects as well like cap drain and warp disruption for 20s, and mwding is even temporarily removed from the picture.i mean, how does that devalue a dd for anyone other than a mail whoring titan pilot?"
3/13/2009,"hey look, a (particularly awful) band of brothers fc arguing in favour of a supercapital boost. my word."
3/13/2009,"sorry i would much rather a drone control range boost and moving while triage than the ability to carry around some hacks(although pouring hacs onto the gatecamps i solo hotdrop would be ****ing hilarious, i see massive potential for abuse)edit: also your resist and hp changes would make supercaps pretty much immmune to support fleets under 500 people."
3/13/2009,also some proof here would be nice to show you aren't simply talking about **** you know nothing about (lawl bob with supercaps that arent camped into pr-) ive personally tried to throw my wyvern through several dozen wormholes that fit capitals with no luck so far.
3/13/2009,from our dev buddies
3/13/2009,and they know everything about their own game... hrmmmm didn't i read about a pos exploit recently. what they say and what's reality are 2 different things.
3/13/2009,"these ships have maintinence bays for loot, why do you need to hold onto it."
3/13/2009,lawl silly ccp they should learn the ****in game like bob has.seriously stop posting and lead more hilariously terrible fleet ops.
3/13/2009,"those pesky neuts, how dare they defy your logic about supercap kills.... stupid capacitor weaknesses. as for moms and titans, it has been done on sisi, i've not checked into it enough post patch."
3/13/2009,"it was allowed on sisi, it wasnt on tranq. the devs even spoke on this. curse those devs ****ing all of your assumptions based off what you heard from a dude who heard from a friend."
3/13/2009,"my appologies, i'll be sure to log into msn tonight after our op.... as for the changes, you've refuted one small portion of an otherwise solid idea."
3/13/2009,i refuted several you just chose to argue only one.
3/13/2009,"from the patch notes:the changes they made to the collision mechanics seem to have worked as stated in the patch notes. smaller ships now bump larger ones less.however, there seems to have been an unintended side effect of this change: capitals bump each other massive distances at high velocities.when does this occur? fleet warping from one location to another. jumping to a cynosural field. undocking.as far as i can tell, this is the result of having collision activated while clipped into another object, which then ejects the objects away from each other. this happened before the collision mechanics change, but has become much more extreme since then.here's an example of a capital bump:please visit your user settings to re-enable images.the two selected dreadnoughts were fleet warped to the same location as me in a small group of capitals, and were bumped the huge distances pictured above. gang warping, jumping together, or even undocking two capital ships at the same time all carry a significant chance for these bumps, which can send a normally very slow ship massive distances, rendering them unable to warp for upwards of several minutes, and also possibly spreading edges of a fleet past the hard coded lock range limit of 250km (if two people are bumped in opposite directions and each travel ~150km as pictured above). the current mechanics available to move capitals around as a fleet are almost unusable because of these bumps.this needs to change, and it needs to change fast."
3/13/2009,"if it's that massive an effect, i agree totally."
3/13/2009,thats insane. looks like fun though actually.you should probably report this as a bug if you haven't already.
3/13/2009,this is a massive issue. fix it.
3/13/2009,"to add to the original post, while registering my support:we tried various techniques to minimize bumping last night, including limiting the number of capitals warping to a specific 10km distance interval to as low as 3-5. the problem is minimized when doing this and when all ships arrive on grid at the same time. bumping occurs, and it's worse than pre-apocrypha, but seemed somewhat manageable. when just one ship warps in late to the same location, the remainder fly like bowling pins. something is seriously screwed up in the mass / inertia calculations here.with only 20 capitals warping to the same point, my estimate is at least 1/5 will consistently be bumped large distances (50 km or more). in larger capital fleets, the bumping frequency will likely be even more pronounced.clearly, this is not working as intended, and ccp should begin working on a resolution immediately. i hope they acknowledge the issue, and offer to reimburse capitals lost due to long range bumps in the interim."
3/13/2009,motherships can very easily bump caps offgrid. 500+ km away simply by warping in at the same point or cynoing into the same beacon
3/13/2009,wow you said you were going to post a thread about me ctrl qing i cant believe you actually did it. but hey there are more whine threads about this than pos warfare so sure ill support it because it'll never happen.
3/13/2009,"you're probably right. it seems ccp is more concerned with carebears having their way and ensuring their security, that and stupid pilots. all these people complain that they dont have a stable connection and its not fair. whats not fair is that for every 1 person with a faulty connection there are 5 asshats exploiting that saying they dropped."
3/13/2009,sup i ctrl q'ed to save the 15b in my freighter. what category do i fit in?
3/13/2009,"cap vs cap. all the dreads are fine.dread vs subcap? honestly? you think pheonix needs to be boosted to allow killing subcaps? the hell? the only reason moros does so well is the drones. even then... hotdrop the stupid moros who is killing subcaps and destroy it. problem solved.i have that recent vid with the moros doing piracy. he had to use faction scrams(2) and web just to get those hits. not to mention blasters. so yes... if the pheonix wants the same performance... he better fit a web or have someone with a web. might i suggest a marauder?obviously. i was at about 11km or so. meaning he could overload and get me. however by the time he burns out. i have only taken a fair bit of dmg, but i go back to tanking. oh no doubt. if i wasnt in the sweet zone. i'dve been smoked lol."
3/13/2009,so if cap vs cap all of them are fine why can i speed tank a group of phoenix in a wyvern?

3/13/2009,"hello to all,i'm sure this has been raised in many times and in many ways by different people, but considering my current eve position i would like to start a thread of my own.basically i would like to ask that ccp increase the benefits of low and high sec, to move people out of high sec and increase the viability of all professions in the lower security regions. it appears that eve has become a predominantly carebear orientated game, with the latest patches increasing content to encourage people to stay in high security space, without providing further incentives to move the influx of newer players into the lower security regions. for example the rewards of high sec missioning are far greater than any to be acheived in 0.0 when you factor in the risk which is also a key element.i am now at the stage in my character development where i would like to go out to the lower security spaces and try out different professions, whether it be low sec piracy or 0.0 gang warfare, but struggle to see why it would be worth it when high sec has so many more targets which can be easily war decced or provoked into starting a fight. if i need isk, it's a simple matter of running to a level 4 agent and spending a couple of hours doing missions and salvaging and i can afford a new battleship.what i propose is either a new feature which is only to be found in the lower security spaces, or rewards which make it worthwhile to travel down through low sec and run the risk of being attacked, so that both the carebears can experience new content and rewards and the pvp players will have more potential targets whilst also having the possibility of utilising these features to make isk or gain some other kind of reward. factional warfare fyi doesnt cut it as the rewards are pretty much worthless especially considering the alternative rewards to be earnt in high sec.there are plenty of whine threads on these forums criticising various aspects of eve whether it be perceived unbalancing of ships or apparent unfair mechanisms, but i like the way it is but just want ccp to utilise the spaces that they have and provide an incentive for people to move out of the crowded empire regions, hence lowering the lag factor, allowing people to choose a viable path other than high sec living and give us some content which everyone can enjoy.typical suggestions by the way which im sure people will mention: increasing low sec mission rewards, lowering the severity of the consequences of having a low security status, increasing low sec and 0.0 mining rewards or an entirely new feature which im sure a member of the ever increasing eve community can come up with.please discuss any potential ideas at will."
3/13/2009,sorry pal... but its quite obvious you have no bloody freaking idea what your talking about.a: the expansion set (+ patch) released content for all new eden... wh space is in all areas.. high...low...and 0.0.b: wh is practically low sec... piracy has found a new sport there. not to mention a great deal of many rewards...but at the risk of getting trapped if you push your luck.c: 0.0 has many many rewards... i know this to be a verifiable fact... but only because i've seen and heard from our alliance. you obviously have no bloody idea what goes on down there nor do you have any personal experience either.bottom line: i suggest you bother going down there before you cast judgment on something that is way over your head.yes... there is a valid problem... but only because you've read about it... play the game first before you make assumptions on a hot topic.raising rewards will not accomplish the objective of making it lucrative.that has been proven many times over.
3/13/2009,"if you bothered to actually read my post, it wasn't regarding new areas for new eden, it was to try and make more use out of low sec which in particular has fewer rewards than high sec, as well as 0.0 which is all the harder to get into as a newer character particularly in small corps if you prefer independence over following an alliance.whilst wormhole space does offer new opportunities i sincerely doubt it will be a long term incentive for carebears to move out of high sec, and will become more of a gimmick to a select group of players it appeals to.also i did not claim to be the master of all knowledge of 0.0, but wanted to simply start this topic as an ideas board for people to contribute to, i hav ebeen into 0.0 plenty of times and still lack the incentive to stay there apart from to shoot up a few idle ratters.i agree that raising rewards will not make it lucrative per se, but there must be a way for the game to be balanced in such a way that we won't see the current demographic of the majority of the player base living in certain regions whilst others go practically unused.i'm sure even you will agree the lag over the past few days has been nothing short of ridiculous, so i remain sceptical of the latest patch in general. surely by providing a mechanic to move people out of high sec then the server would have a more equally distributed load and improve playing experience for everyone?"
3/13/2009,no it's not.... your just not trying hard enough. the fact is 0.0 is meant for alliances...soloing won't do because 0.0 is typically held by gangs... and if you don't have any isk.. they won't let you do anything... you have to find an alliance that will let you do what you want.guess again bub... your making assumptions... read c&p (yes i know its ghastly) and you'll see its becoming a rather intersting incentive to drop pos's in wh space for the reaping of rewards.the trick is getting out again... alive. and its possible to do with the right amount of ambition.it might help to have some authority on the subject before making conclusions about something you dont know about!then your wasting time... don't post something without having some sort of solution or it will be ignored... or wasted on.no i will not agree.stop making assumptions about everyone else and start using your bloody head.i have not experienced lag... and i'm doing just fine thank you very much.
3/13/2009,"low sec is doomed to suck. it has all the worst traits of 0.0 and high sec combined, with no of the benifits of either. the moment something is done to change that, say make something low sec exclusive, you have effectly nerfed 0.0. which should always by intended design of the game be the area with the highest rewards and risk."
3/13/2009,"well then i'll just sit here and enjoy the fact that you are getting so worked up about it you feel the need to capitalise your statements. god forbid someone might think it's only a game and should pass their opinion on what they would like to see. i'll just let you carry on ranting, might need to raise another thread requesting ccp ban the use of ... over and over again."
3/13/2009,i'm not getting worked up over anything.you are... by the sheer fact your replying to each and every little response ive made.you have no opinion... you have assumptions... your grasping at straws... jumping at shadows.as it was so put best... the balance of the game is not something to be idlely conjectured on... its diverse..its complex.and i'll be damned if i let someone make assumptions and sway other people who think they know whats what.i never said i was an expert in 0.0 or low sec.hell i rarely ever come up with ideas because 9 times out of 10... they are all crap.this game is very complex... you nerf one thing... it jacks something else.you buff one thing... it screws the rest of the system out.low sec is supposed to be risky.... and its made risky due to piracy.if it wasn't so bloody dangerous... people would go there more often... so people who have no intention of losing there hard earned isk will not go there... instead they pass it entirely.i however will not... i fully intend to strike out in low sec when my agenda goals have been met... to prove everyone wrong... that low sec can be made useful... its just a matter of perspective. if i find out otherwise... then at least i gave it my best.unlike someone who makes assumptions.at least with wh space... there's a lovely distraction... and that's just fine by me.
3/13/2009,"speaking for me only: the reward of moving out of high-sec is being out of high-sec. if a pilot is satisfied ""punching a clock for the man"" (working for an agent), so be it. i could never be satisfied with that and can't imagine that extra incentives are neccessary for pilots to get out of high sec. moving out of empire was like moving out of my parents house when i turned 18 - i couldn't do it fast enough."
3/13/2009,op is so fail.no change is needed.
3/13/2009,you leave high sec for the challenge. if you don't want a challenge you don't leave high sec.
3/13/2009,i approve!
3/13/2009,"ok i don't know about the big alliances but even just managing a small alliance and its issues takes me away from playing the game so here is my proposals to allow alliance management to be more streamlined.1). in the alliance tab add the ability to set the fee for corp membership of the alliance. a). give a couple of options ie: monthly, quarterly, yearly, by corp size. b). add a date of collection ie: 1st of the month c). make it automatic as in it sends an automatic bill to each member corp that appears in there wallet on the set date and which they can click on to pay it.2). change the standings system so that when you set a standing to a corp or alliance to blue it generates a message to there standings tab (request for standing). with an optional message field. they have the option to accept or reject the request. if they accept both entities standings to each other are set the same. if they reject then neither entities standing is changed. as an addition if one part of the nap or friendship changes there mind and resets there standing the other part is automatically notified and there standing reset to neutral. no notification would be given if you where changing your standing from neutral to enemy or unfriendly.this should free up alot of evemail lists and time spent crunching standings.3). give the option to set roles and titles at alliance lvl across alliance corps, so that trusted people can be given access to set standings, manage alliance owned structures and an alliance hanger( like corp hanger but i'd suggest only 4 tabs that should be enough.) alliance research roles, manufacturing and combat roles.4). an alliance message of the day system and alliance op advertisement system ( bit like the corp recruitment system but internal to alliance corps only) can be only used by designated alliance officers using suggestion 3 above. again this would free up evemail. (this would also be handy at corp level too)5). automatic paying of alliance bill from exec corp designated wallet as long as the wallet has enough isk the bill is payed, warning evemail sent to all alliance designated officers in the case of lack of funds.6). alliance vote system for disbanding of alliance and a minimum of 1 week for the vote. all ceo's of member corps to have the capability to vote. only ceo of the exec corp can call for alliance disbanding. on failure of the vote the execcorp loses noiminated status and the alliance needs to nominate a new exec corp. alliance benefits suspended as per current game dynamics.7). ability for all players to set a discount on there market sell orders for alliance and/or corp members (ie: as a percentage off . also allow all alliance members to search the market for alliance members sales ( keeps the isk in the alliance and also allows the alliance to sell alliance produced products to it's members).8). ability to lock alliance mail or assign posting privliges too member corp ceo's and directors only.all in all the above ideas are to make alliance management easier remove the need for alts in a seperate exec corp and to seperate exec corp directors from alliance management unless they have the required roles so improved security. improved communication between member corps and more automation of important but time consuming game dynamics that detract the management players from being able to actually play the game and build up the alliance and there corps.... and most of all remove alot of typing of evemails replies and convo's with fellow ceo's when u could all be out pvp'ing, mining or whatever your enjoyment in eve is...aluthinaka gregory condor chief exec of knightraven allianceall critism and suggestions welcome"
3/13/2009,i cant support this either - it would change the dyanmics of gate-camping too much.
3/13/2009,this
3/13/2009,i agree with this idea - cloaking ships should not be able to stay cloaked in systems for hours on end with impunity. in warfare there is a counter to everything.
3/13/2009,thisbut im not that ok whit the idea...there should be a counter to cloking but it just dosent feel like this is the solution
3/13/2009,here's an alternate fix to cloaking: remove local in 0.0.... oh wait.
3/13/2009,dont forget to support ;-p
3/13/2009,pos shields are nauseating!haven't seen a warp bubble yet... i'm too busy trying not to get seasick while trying to manage my pos fleet. :(
3/13/2009,just went through a bubble tonight and it is identical to being inside a pos shield (aka nauseating).
3/13/2009,define this better. i'm hearing pos shields look like a gian christmas light now.if this is what you saw then for the love of god tell me how! i can deal with giant overglowy ball if it means i can see the bubble lol.
3/13/2009,being inside a pos shield is like being behind a waterfall. a low res waterfall at that. there is no freaking mistaking it though. if you see it you will know it.as for how i did it no clue really. i have a good machine and all eye-candy settings maxed. i also have anisotropic filtering (af) forced on in my video drivers to x8 (nhancer ftw!). i did notice when i flew ~20km away from the bubble it disappeared completely. flew back closer and it just blinked back into existence. so *maybe* if your af is low or off it is technically too far away from you for the computer to draw it. total wild assed guess there but something you might look in to.
3/13/2009,"screw the box, and make it ao."
3/13/2009,"the problem is that some very large retailers (like walmart, or at least they use to) refuse to stock games with ao ratings. it would bad business decision to make the game ao and possibly lose massive sales over an exotic dancer."
3/13/2009,"i seriously doubt the idea to make a box for eve was a good one, since most people that would pick it up will not keep playing for long."
3/13/2009,"agreed, i'd like to know this too. i'm completely against any irrational censorship (what's wrong with half-naked bodies ffs, it's not like people can't just google 'pron' and get about 0.8 internets worth of nakedness), and to be honest i don't like the idea of ccp changing their game just to get a 't' sticker that might attract a few more noobs, 99% of whom will quit after the first week and their first encounter with 'evil griefers' (aka other players). the players with the maturity to stick to the game will almost exclusively ignore the 't' sticker, or lack thereof."
3/13/2009,confirming i'll be scamming and griefing any new players i encounter in order to prevent them from getting permanently scarred by naked women... oh wait.
3/13/2009,speaking of censorship... what about the cockpit? you know... the place where the pilot sits while flying?
3/13/2009,"geez don't get a teen rating, the reason people play this game is because there is a considerably less amount of whiny annoying chavs."
3/13/2009,"well i took the time to read that entire thread, and i agree with the naysayers. the original idea as presented has the right goals and achieves none of them. i've fueled a few pos's in my time and i don't see how this is a benefit to that process. maybe in empire it makes things easier but outside of empire it does not.this idea could work with some adjustments. using a pellet in place of consumables isn't a bad idea in itself. requiring the pellet to be manufactured and requiring the ice products to be present for that production are the main problems. the isotopes need to be removed from that process to make it viable. even then it's still an extra step or an extra cost to do what people are already doing. tldr: 5 steps is more steps than 4 steps no matter how cool the name ""fuel cells"" sounds.if the people who plan to present this to/at the csm meeting really want to improve eve they should make sure that the problem they are trying to solve is real and that the solution addresses that problem correctly. is it really a problem to have to do math to fuel pos's? afterall there is an in game calculator provided for those things. lets say that it is a real problem, in that case i think outsourcing the math at a cost in return for a magical fuel pellet is an ok solution. however forcing people to deal with the pellet system just so a few people can avoid math doesn't seem right. we need a solution that makes pos fueling easier, for those who think it's hard, while not making it harder for those who think it's just fine as is."
3/13/2009,anything that would help organization
3/13/2009,"when i started eve with my friends we had a corp of 5 members. after 3 month we got wardecced by some self-appointed griefers. and guess what: we eventually beaten them. we decided to ruin their gameplay with guerilla warfare, we were using noob alts as eyes, afking days if camped, but only engage at least with the same numbers and odds. they were running out of patience, they made mistakes we used them out, eventually they lost 2 bs, 1 command ship, 1 battlecruiser during the war against 3 month old noob characters without losses on our side. and of course they were the one to retreat from the war. eve isn't a game for whining. there is always a solution, just need to find it. everything that doesn't destroy you, will make you stronger. and of course there is hello kitty online for the weak..."
3/13/2009,"*signs graciously*here on the forums is where the mass majority of the eve game community participates in discussions about the game, what's going on in game, and various in game actions (buying, selling, trading, asking for help, discussing future changes to the game, etc.) community is the operative word. if the csm are meant to represent the community, than they should be able to bring up how ccp can make a better game, as well as improve relations with the community, and that happens on these forums."
3/13/2009,please re-read the original post and what it is asking the vote to be about. also look up the definition of purview. getting a stated reason why someone has been banned should be a complete different issue.ivory
3/13/2009,"in the context of the op, purview means means oversight, not control."
3/13/2009,well every organisation govermental or otherwise that has a oversight committee has control
3/13/2009,this the goon conga line?op has a point but forums isn't exclusively in game or out game. it has eg the out of pod forums as well the corp recruitment forums. the parts that are relevant to the in game real of new eden automatically are covered by csm anyway.csm at least should be able to comment on this privately and publicly without getting moderated. (besides mods shouldn't be allowed to play eve to avoid any bias.)i don't think this will change anything since your avg paranoia will continue to scream bias anyway. csm oversight still will be very limited even then.
3/13/2009,supported i have also posted this and other alliance management tools here alliance management tools
3/13/2009,"a minor issue, but one that's been annoying me lately. when you buy and sell with both personal and corp orders, the transactions window helpfully colour-codes which ones are corp orders and which ones are personal orders(blue and white, respectively), but there's no similar scheme for the orders window. i'd like to see the same system get applied to the orders window as well, to make the two types easier to distinguish."
3/13/2009,you have my thumb sir.very good idea.
3/13/2009,"1- create a new ui element consisting of a single button. alternatively this could be built into an existing ui element like the overview.2- add a context mention option to certain entities (e.g. bookmarks, celestials, stations, poss, and stargates) called set warp-to hot button that will set that entity as the current destination for the button.3- when a player clicks the button one of two things happen:a- if the destination is in the same system, the ship will attempt to warp to the location.b- if the destination is in another system, the ship will attempt to warp to the out gate based on current autopilot settings (warp to 0)."
3/13/2009,"this seems unnecessary. the autopilot already highlights gates for wtzing, and if the destination is in system, you can just click on it and use the existing selected item interface to do this. maybe make bookmarks selectable(and alignable), but that's an entirely different issue."
3/13/2009,agreed.it's just too easy to right click and warp to bookmarks as it is.make bookmarks easier to use.but otherwise not supported.
3/13/2009,"yes, nerf non-consentual buddy list!!that said, the info it provides is fairley usless anyway. :p"
3/13/2009,you should stop going in and out of wormholes so often... its bad for the mental acuity.
3/13/2009,"since the docking/undocking games are becoming ever lamer each day, i think it's time for a slight revamp. this is a 2 parter. part 1:if we are allowed to hit station services, the docking point should be added to this system. obviously, you need to be able to dock, so rather than break until repaired... it should become a redocking time game based on ship size bigger ships would have a harder time moving through the rubble trying to redock. a message would warn people of the hazzards of undocking as well so that the carebear nation of 0.0 could manage their emotional outburst of hatred for this idea. keep in mind npc 0.0 would be left unchanged... unfortunately the gayness would survive there.if offline:frigates 30s redockcruiser/hac 2 min redockbattleships 5 min redockcapitals 10 min redocklogistically, the removal of this station feature would hurt alliances quite effectively. strategically, the undock pvp games, especially with rr bs and carriers would be all but removed. i personally am just sick of the carebear pvp huddling around the station 0.0 seems to be turning into as of late. if you're gonna fight, fight.... if you're gonna fight, fight.part 2:now the 2nd tear of this is related to just that notion of pvp. without any station service feature involved, if a ship aggro's outside a station, their flag time before re-docking needs to be increased based on ship size. npc or player owned stations alike.so if a player deems it necessary to aggro outside a station:frigates redock 30scruisers 1 minbs 3 mincapitals 5 min..... half a siege cycle of timer allowing for hot drops if they're so stupid as to aggro.from a common sense perspective, a big ass ship undocking would naturally take longer to redock in the first place. so from a simple role play perspective this makes more sense. but to a further extent, it removes the **** tease pvp that station camping is turning into."
3/13/2009,"i would rather see all undock timers be 2min minimum. nothing based off ship sizes though, also not caring if you shot someone.but there should then coupled with that have an ability to see if someone is uncloaked (ala overview) outside your station"
3/13/2009,".2 minutes isn't enough time for a mistake to be made in a capital and most times in a rr bs group... this is intended to force more sense into doing something rather than the haphazzardness with which people play in 0.0. npc is left unaffected, and all of 0.0 is left unaffected unless you're under direct attack... requiring you to actually defend yourselves. god forbid you shouldn't be able to pvp and use docking as a tanking method."
3/13/2009,"just make the redocking timer based on the sig of the ship.small ships re-dock almost immediately, larger ships take longer.everywhere"
3/13/2009,how about you just say undocking timer based on ____and cut out the melodramatic crap.honestly i don't really see the reason for all of that... unless you allow multiple undocking pathways.then you can use all the timers you want.
3/13/2009,"well that would be a pretty annoying feature - think of it, just a simple example: you are going after your friendly fleet of bs allready in late by 2 jumps. you undock and realize that u left your favourite exotic dancers - your lucky charm in the station. your most important attribute in fleetbattles is your name and your luck, so you don't get primaried. now if you have to wait 2 damn minutes, by the time you undock again the fleet is allready 8 jumps away and you probably will end up dead, because that's the fate of straglers...all i wanted to say, is that redock should be aggro affiliated, if u don't aggro why to waste your time.and of course, i give my support for the rest: no docking at least for 5 minutes if u've aggroed."
3/13/2009,"yes a delay to docking, but as with freelancer, u have to request docking permission before waiting a set time before being towed to the station"
3/13/2009,this
3/13/2009,agree with the op
3/13/2009,"a more proper solution is to look at the current station dock radius and make sure that it is relatively same distance (+-3 km) to the undock point.right now, we got some stations with 0 distance between undock and dock point. and other stations with 15+ km - ridiculously huge dock radius.also, in the past, a good way to counter docking games was to use bump mechanics with nanoed hacs and battleships. since the nano-speed tactics were removed from game, bumping has suffered a great decrease in potency. it's nearly impossible to bump a carrier from dock range with current speeds and agility."
3/13/2009,"that too needs to be looked at, i agree... there are some stations with 30-100km undock/redock radius. the docking feature as a whole needs an overhaul, this is just my contribution to what needs fixing."
3/13/2009,"while i'm almost tempted to say that'd be one of the best things possible for the game, it'll never happen because of marketing requirements. they'll keep trickling out improvements over time, like they have been, and we'll get there eventually. also, don't assume any amount of testing will get you a bug-free product. some things just don't show up on test server scales - either nobody runs into it, or the problem is only existent at a scale that the test server's don't reach(i.e., anything that downs jita). sometimes, putting it up live is about the only thing you can do to debug it."
3/13/2009,"i can see it now, the marketing add, ""we fixed all the bugs and game play issues finally, its safe to play now!""i would not mind at all if new content was postponed to ensure it works properly and does not create any new issues/bugs due to short sightedness as well as fixing a lot of the broken mechanics."
3/13/2009,"i am willing to deal with the occasional bug as long as it accompanies ever-increasing levels of awesome. so far, so good. :) i think ccp needs to keep on keepin' on."
3/13/2009,1up
3/13/2009,small fast ships up front with scram / web / small guns (frigs)medium range guns / ecm / extra webs in center (cruisers)long range ships sitting more to the rear with dedicated long range ecm capitals at the back engaging at max range or providing logistic support.remote reps at all ranges and dedicated logistics ships free to move throughout the fleet.would look cool and if properly implemented in a fight could possibly be maintained in larger fights. ( =25 vs =25 ) small fleets would never maintain formation though so it would only be nice for pritty pictures.
3/13/2009,ccp made it clear enouf befor the pach...there will be atleast 1 wormhole/wormhole sistemthis mite lead to known space or to a nother wormhole sistem....it mite not have the mass to let u pass ...but there will always be a connection...so keep scanning
3/13/2009,no.
3/13/2009,are csm being paid to be totally flaccid impotent and generally ineffective? i wonder...they remind me of rl politicians
3/13/2009,"oh fun, vague allegations of stupid conspiracy theories being shouted from the rooftops. congratulations, you've managed to one-up the jpsc ""people don't care about the csm, so i'm going to protest them by not voting!"" whiners."
3/13/2009,"you havent tackled missiles ships with an interceptor lately. you cannot tank them like before speed-nerf. everything cruiser / bc will kill your orbiting interceptor slowly, where turretships won't hit after all. even skilled ravens without neutralizers can kill your interceptor. why? after all a small ship like an interceptor should be able to outmaneuver such big things, so the missiles dont even explode. yes and tracking enhancers / damage mods / passive eccm/ sensor thingies use armortanking slots. whats you problem exactly? unlike...what? you know other ships drones get popped the same way at the same time. unless the player sits in a moros, dominix, ishtar, vexor, arbitrator, curse, pilgrim, did i miss any? so if missiles hit instantly, why not use turrets anyway? also missiles don's miss, they hit, no matter what what. unless you are out of range."
3/13/2009,maybe as an extra role for logistic ships? or especially for drone boats. so all ships could reconfigure their dronebay at a droneboat / logistic ship.

3/14/2009,bring it back! for both capitals and jump bridges.
3/14/2009,agreeing with this kenzoku dude that the old cyno effect was way cooler.
3/14/2009,in my very early days i was lucky enough to see a mothership jump. it was incredible. now? wow ccp. i think one blemish on the new graphics.

3/14/2009,"hell yea we need a better cyno effect! i loved tearing space appart as i jumped before apoc, now it looks like dropping a pebble in some water <U+FFFD>.<U+FFFD>"

3/14/2009,"it's generally quite hard to explain how a 10% shield hp bonus is actually pretty powerful in both pvp in small gangs and pve... (hint, it can tank 800dps passively right now, 50k shields, hp bonuses stack with extenders) unless your able to do the math, my advice is to trust me."

3/14/2009,"there is no game mechanic difference at all between empire and pirate agents and standings.faction standing from storyline missions cannot be shared with a gang, no exceptions.having -2.0 or worse with a faction (after skills) blacklists you for all agents in all corporations of that faction, no exception."

3/14/2009,"yes.this is a much more balanced proposal than the other supercapital change thread, easier to implement, and less likely to break something, while giving motherships needed improvement."
3/14/2009,also i will support my own thread
3/14/2009,"motherships don't need to get bonuses to their damage, they aren't suppose to be an even more powerful (and imbalanced) version of the moros.increase remote transfer/rep range per level, yes.increased amount or decreased cycle time, yes.move while in triage? probably isn't possible, but would pass on this.increased calibration? i'd like to see 5-6 rig slots for super caps and 4-5 for capitals in general really. maybe not the ability to throw on half a dozen t2 rigs of your choice, but 5-600 calibration and 5-6 slots would be awesome (even if it just results in massive ccc/trimark stacking).the mothership isn't suppose to be the ultimate drone ship, more like the ultimate fleet support ship. i don't ever recall them saying the mothership's intended role was to be drone death incarnate. that's what people simply want to see it become."
3/14/2009,"why wouldnt it be possible to let them move while triaged? the triaged module gives you a -100% speed buff, you simply turn that off the same you turn off targeting delays for stealth bombers uncloaking :)we want it given a role, currently it has zero role that cant be filled equally by a much, much cheaper ship. if they want it to be high end repping, make it that, if they want it to be drone **** incarnate, make it that, but being a very very expensive carrier whose only major differences are clone vat(lololol no one uses those), remote ecm burst(awesomely fun) and a few extra fighters takes out any real value of owning one.for the cost of one ms you could buy several carriers and a character fully skilled to fly them."
3/14/2009,sounds good to me.
3/14/2009,seems like a good idea to make ms actually worth something
3/14/2009,"this isn't the perfect solution, but for the love of god, do something."
3/14/2009,"hmm, yes. a role bonus to remove the immobility penalty on triage for a ship that is immune to ewar. what a fantastic idea. i, too, would like a ship that is immortal so long as it is near a pos shield.besides that, these are reasonable changes but motherships will still be too weak for their cost."
3/14/2009,i'd just be happy if they tripled the carrying capacity of motherships. that alone would make them quite worthwhile. (both cha & sma)
3/14/2009,supporting dis
3/14/2009,"*endlessly circles a can at the edge of a hardened pos shield while in triage mode, making shooting a pos take 4 hours longer*"
3/14/2009,ya its a shame you cant already do this with a bs fleet a titan a few carriers or any number of other things. also im not really sure what sort of mothership you flaw(lawl none ever) but youre not going to orbit **** every fast and youre still susceptible to being bumped and nueted down to dead as you come out of the shields.
3/14/2009,"motherships being able to move in triage is a great idea. they still can't warp or cyno out but they will finally be fill the roll of offensive repping (which is done better by a triage nidhoggur and a bump ship right now).as for the other changes, all carriers really need extra drone range control for all drones."
3/14/2009,"nope sorry, the changes they need are defensive, and support in nature, not offensive. repping is the biggest joke introduced to carriers since well anything in this game, so that's pretty fail too. what good does moving in triage do either... people don't like using moms b/c they're predominantly offense, and w/o any decent lvl of defense, they don't want to field them for fear of getting pop shot by dreads in under 5 seconds."
3/14/2009,agreed
3/14/2009,i approve of this message.
3/14/2009,totally supported. these ships are not worth one 10th of there cost and nobody is particularly afraid of them any more. the op has the correct combination of pwaneg and vulnerability.though i am not particularly bothered whether the improvement are identical to the op. the op is a cracking example.
3/14/2009,"tbh, you've designed another tier of carrier, and not really a mothership.another 3 types of carrier could really be created as teir 2 (transport, logistics/defensive, and offensive) where as mom's should be something else entirely. even still the jump between carrier and mom right now is akin to that of frigate to interceptor."
3/14/2009,yes but only in the same way as the jump from battleship to titan. your lines of thinking are fundamentally flawed :) supercaps are supposed to be the end all why would you want another tier of things that are better? ccp already stated they wanted to work down at this point not up.
3/14/2009,"not supported.this will not work. people did not post in the summit and it died. caod exists as a public forum. if you want a private and further restricted forum ask for the summit back. then it can die again from lack of interest.you cannot achieve this goal in a public forum format, it is simply impossible."

3/14/2009,"you forgot to ask for titans to be able to also permanently warp scramble everything in range of 250km.they should also have huge speakers on the outside, and broadcast propaganda (not that anyone would hear, but would still be cool).and they should glow in dark..."
3/14/2009,anyone supporting this particular proposal needs to have their head examined.
3/14/2009,a well balanced proposal that the csm should seriously consider.
3/14/2009,"definitely valid concerns that need to be addressedi also want to say that i am disappointed with the bumping nerf mechanics for smaller ships. bumping, while unnatural, offers very interesting tactical situations. bumping a carrier out of dock range with battleships and hacs used to be pretty fun and balanced.this is one of those cases where we shouldn't make the game more realistic, instead favor the fun factor. strong bumping mechanics add an extra dimension to combat, making smaller ships more valuable against larger ones."
3/14/2009,"the patch definitely broke the hell out of bumping and it needs to be fixed to preserve normal capship combat and operations.edit- and even with reasonable measures to stagger warp-ins and avoid this, one or two ships getting flung across the grid into an indefensible spot is basically inevitable."

3/14/2009,support.i understand that the scale was origionally 'levelled off' due to technical issues back in 'the day' id like to see if theese issues can now be addressed using current technologies.possibly an excuse to re-work the rather scatty collision engine.
3/14/2009,i be happy if the phoenix could again battle with sub-cap ships and do some real dmg too them. but i be happy if they just fix the issue where a moving target the size of a titan can speed tank a group of phoenix dreads. it's just silly.i looking at number here. if i had a group of 10 phoenix dreads attacked by 15 battleships the phoenix crew would be whole sale screwed. while on the other hand any other dread in a group of 10 could at least pose a danger too the enemy.same issue when you scale up too caps.no group of ships of any type or race should be useless simply as your target is moving.
3/14/2009,"the op has in fact hit on the central problem to low-sec. risk vs. reward. there's no reason to move to lowsec where the bulk of the gankers gather for the simple reason that i can make far more money with far less risk by not leaving high-sec space.what would need to happen to change this is to make hi-sec less profitable, not lo-sec more profitable. i'd probably start by cutting the rarer ores (plag, omber, pyrox, and kernite) out of high-sec space altogether. yes, i'm a miner, yes, that means i'm left with veldspar and scordite. but there's only so much you can manufacture with just pyrite and tritanium. and while tritanium may be the highest profit mineral atm, i guarantee you would find some miners willing to take the risk to mine in low-sec - and charge incrementally more for those minerals that are now available only to those willing to take the risks to mine them.this would also teach the carebears (guilty as charged) to operate in packs for self defense and protection. pvp in the game would go up (meh, i can take it or leave it, but it's occasionally fun) as mining groups fought over asteroid belts (which, i think was kind of one of the points of eve) and against the pirates.additionally, this doesn't nerf null-sec, because it doesn't take away any of the things only found there (like the rarest of ores, and of course, sov). howeverm it gives players an incentive to move out of high sec, if they don't want to artifically limit their own income streams.it is, indeed, about risk and reward. in this case, it's far more lucrative to skip low sec altogether and go straight into a null-sec alliance or stay in high-sec than to try and operate in low-sec for any extended period of time."
3/14/2009,"low sec:bs ratsmany more signatures and anomalies compared to high-sec. also, less competition. no real politics in low-sec as super-large alliances have no reason to kill you in low-sec. so guess what? smaller corps can move out here and operate pretty successfully. my previous corp did.roids are better than high-sec. end of story.you can make the rules without a lot of concord interference. so yeah, low-sec isn't super rich but it isn't super poor. it has good risk combined with ample opportunity to make isk. you just have to be creative about it.no support.--isaac"
3/14/2009,last 2 posters hit the nail on the head dead on.that... is rational and makes sense.however... low sec risk may have changed.there's an increase in pirate traffic headed to whs... so i would suggest taking a breather for a couple weeks and see what happens eh?

3/14/2009,personally i feel getting a tech 2 salvager is a colossal waste of isk.a scant 2% increase is just not worth it...
3/14/2009,"i hear this all the time. almost every tech 2 ship/item (miner iis being one of the very few exceptions) requires a skill to be level v. tech 2 means you have mastered the equipment, not just good at it. also, 7% from 5% is a 40% increase in chance to salvage using a tech 2 salvager (not including the salvage skill @ level v) you just want free efficiency for doing not work and not putting in any training time. either do the work to get the skills or don't."

3/14/2009,encounter a falcon that kicked your ass recently i take it?grow up.... learn to play the game.your idea is stupid.... and poorly thought out.what your saying is ecm should never completely jam anyone... the whole point of ecm is to jam your ship. ecm is based on a random roll of the dice... sometimes ships.. like the falcon will have more dice which means more chances to jam you successfully.your saying you should still be able to target someone.. don't work that way kid.so time for you to get out of your pampers... and grow up.

3/14/2009,i'm sorry but this seems utterly hilarious to me.
3/14/2009,"as gallente pilot i recognize your issues, but i am finally happy to see npcs with improved ai. drones are ment to be vulnerable to your opponent (other player or npc)"
3/14/2009,"drones work fine against sleepers, you just have to watch them. you can't use them like you're fighting ""normal"" dumb rats. i'm in unexplored space in a pilgrim and my drones are doing well."
3/14/2009,drones tend to be overlooked as serious threats.sleepers obviously are not as stupid as most rats are. : o )
3/14/2009,"yah sure your tiny mediums are doing fine, they can return in time, you ever try heavys? at 30 km away there is no hope of recovering them b4 they are blasted to death. and because the domi and ishtar's primary dps is drones the sleepers are smart enough to take them out.my only point is that theese ships are not viable for sleeper space and causes a balanceing issue over the diffrent reces in eve.i do not wish to see the rats as stupid as the old npc's in fact i find the whole idea refreshing and fun... i jsut wish there was a way to make gallente as viable in sleeper space as other races."
3/14/2009,"in my experience, sleepers are just as stupid as any other rat, they just work on pos gun ai(rotating targets) instead of rat ai(fixed targets). drones get aggro a fair bit, but it's not exactly crippling - i flew a domi around at least a dozen anomalies, and didn't lose a single drone. reel them when they take aggro, and only use drones you can reel easily - sentries, lights, mediums if they get in close. the problem is on your end, the ai is as pathetic as it ever was."
3/14/2009,"i agree, i trained t2 heavy drones so i can launch mediums and sentrys out.... whatever i give up. im training for a raven like every other carebear noob out there.on a serious note they do not work on pos gun rotateing targets, at least not in my experiance... reason? they can shoot 2 targets at once.. and seem to aggro whatever is doing the most damage.. a pos does not do that =)and i will try sentrys, dont have that to t2 yet but it is still worth a shot, ty."

3/14/2009,"and i bet you trained them to use in your ishkur too, right? after all, it's a drone boat. man, just think of how ****ed off the guy who trained carriers to do his cn missions more effectively must feel. not every skill is used all the time. there are some skills even a typhoon can't make good use of. the problem isn't that t2 heavies aren't good(though they still can be - pvp defences, any time you let a bs get in close enough reeling is still possible, etc.), it's that you expect them to always be a win button. that was never the purpose of t2 heavies, or any other skill for that matter. use what fits the task, not what you invested the most sp in, and if that's not something you feel qualified to do, then don't do it. your domi still kicks ass in l4s, keep it there if you're not willing to adjust it for viability in wormholes."
3/14/2009,"the magnetometic sites are too weak of a signal strength for the new probe system to pick up in anything other then a covert-ops.i have level 4 of all the probe skills. i also have the probe implants. i also have sister launcher, and two gravity capacity rigs. this picks up every other site apart from magnetometic. with that setup you can only get to about 95% you can never get to 100%. this is with the probes so close together and set to 0.25au and even 7 of them deployed. this is not some sort of ""learning curve issue"" the highest i can get no matter what i do is 94.05%.all that needs to happen is magnetometic sites need a signal strength boost, 10% should be good.i'm going to buy some sister probes and see how that turns out, since they are 10% more base sensor strength it may be enough.i don't think it's right that you have to use a covert-ops for scanning down sites now. i'm not talking about wormholes, or any other site, just the normal exploration sites.out of all the improvements made to probing this is the only thing that needs to be looked at in my opinion, just buff the mag sites signal strength a little."

3/14/2009,how are you arranging your probes? it could be a problem with your configuration. see this thread for more info.
3/14/2009,"like i had said, this is not a learning issue or something that i don't know how to do. i understand the system the math behind it just fine. the issue is the signal strength is simply too weak to be picked up in anything other then a covert-ops ship.as evidence here is a screen shot of the probes.to give you an idea on how close these are, this is the system map zoomed in as far as it can go, and the probes are set to 0.25au as you can see.and before anyone comments on it, no the probes are not too close. this is as close as i can get them before it disappears. and if i move them away from this proximity the signal strength gets weaker.if you don't believe me, try hunting down a mag site in anything other then a covert-ops. trust me this screen shot shows 40minutes left on the probes. however it's probe 15, which means i have deployed two sets, why? because i had to. i had to recall the probes the first time because it had only 5 minutes left on them.after well over 90 minutes this is as good as the signal can get. the only change that needs to happen is to bring mag sites up to the same level of signal strength as radar, grav, and unknown sites. (haven't found a ladar site so i'm not sure what they are like.)edit:- link correction."
3/14/2009,"consider this issue closed... it is doable, you just need sister probes to do it."
3/14/2009,"i totaly agree that interface on alliance level must exist, aswell as the other tools for alliance interaction. this is on my todo list to prepare complete document about it, to compile all usefull ideas from this forums and then to raise issues. i think that we had 5 or 6 threads (including aluthin's one about alliance tools in last few months and none is complete. hopefully i will have it finished soon(tm) :dtill then feel free to post your ideas."

3/14/2009,"yeah, i know about that, and it helps sometimes. thing is, it really ought to be done correctly everywhere. there's only two people who do corp orders in my corp, so it's not too bad, but can you imagine sifting through the thousands of them you might have for a decent-sized industrial corp just to figure out which of your own orders are corporate?"

3/14/2009,"i'm in favour of making those 2 extra slots trainable. if it needs to be paid for, so be it, but it should be less than an extra account (or 2), because an extra account has more benefits then just the skill training.i would love to use my extra slots, but never did because i don't want to slow my first character down (let's face it, training skills takes long enough), so if nothing changes, i will probably just play one character until i can't think of skills to train or i get tired of him.and i won't take a second account until i've filled all 3 slots, and want a 4th, ccp."

3/14/2009,"it is true, we are paid vast amounts of money, sadly the pay is currently in the form of iceland's isks so given the baggage restrictions and the total lack of value of the currency we all left the multiple duffel bags of icelandic money in our hotel rooms when we checked out.seriously, i think you need to spend some time understanding what the csm can do for eve. we can't be every players opportunity to drive random odd feature requests into eve. we can however provide oversight (which i think we did a great job doing with the pos exploit) and we can affect medium to long term plans that ccp might have for game direction.you might not believe it but i can assure you i think we were very effective in our discussions with ccp in iceland in shaping how eve will evolve going forward. does that mean for example the csm got ccp to stop everything that they were working on to:1. immediately fix black ops?2. change sov mechanics?3. change how poss work?4. insert your favorite idea here...no, it doesn't. we did however discuss most everything that was raised to the csm either officially or in informal settings. i think we were heard and i believe that in the future those meetings will make eve better than it would have been if there wasn't a csm.i've talked about this before and it has been mentioned more times than i can count that changes are more involved than you might think and often the best order to introduce changes is not obvious to someone not directly involved in developing the game. just because something isn't in the next patch is no indication that it isn't in the queue somewhere.so more to the point about the csm. as a player in eve you can choose to believe that the csm has a purpose and can make your life in eve better over time. if you think that, find a candidate that seems to view life in the 'verse the same way you do and vote for them (or run yourself!).if you don't believe the csm has a purpose i'd propose you ask yourself why not giving the concept a chance is the right choice. i would still suggest to you that you find a candidate (or run yourself) and try and make it matter. what do you have to lose?and i'll end with this. my trip to iceland was anything but a vacation. the travel for many of us spanned days. we went in the winter when there is only something like 4 hours of sunlight. we spent almost all the time there in meetings about eve. when we did socialize it was more towards fast food than ""fine dining"". in some cases the members actually got sick and were not enjoying themselves at all. jet lag was a big issue for many of us. it was work, not play.if you want to see iceland (and i think it is a great place to add to anyone's vacation destination list) go sometime other than winter! if you want to make the trip include a lot of ""fun"" eve content then the fanfest should be part of your plans. if you want to go to iceland for fun the csm is not the best way to do it. so if you run for the csm please do it because you want to make eve better, not for what you think is a free vacation.issler"

3/15/2009,agreeing with my space enemies.
3/15/2009,"its good to see a lot of positive support for this, esp from a csm member. and from aaa and goons:d but isaac is right to bring this up:i wasnt quite sure on what the effects of the old cyno jumping had onto the game and in fleet battles. ive been hot dropped a few times but not seen a fleet of 50+ dreads and the like drop out and that into something. the point that lag, graphicly and all that, is very valid. so actual ideas? well considering we can change the overview and remove brackets and reduce effects to remove the graphic lags why wouldn't this work too? obviously you would need a base effect (please correct me on this, im no compwiz.) so what would it be? well why not the current one as normal? and an optimized version of the old one as a shock and awe effect. first the bubble that we currently have encases the ship, then simultaneously that lovely lightning directional warp portal opens up and whoosh, your gone. on the other side it the bubble is returned and it opens up with an explosion of lightning all around/or again, just an optimized version of the above. and if you dont want that effect just turn it off.im being descriptive but remember we don't want to over do it. as isaac has said there is the problems of lag and graphical lag that have to be addressed, with something like the above you, provided you know what you're doing, can choose to turn the graphics down to jump into cap fights or if you're going to be hotdropped, or if you wanna show off to some friends or random newbs, or even just wanting to see it yourself, you can turn it on and chaaarrrgge! hehe. i hope that suffices as ideas. of course im just putting this forward as a general idea, im certain others may have some?"

3/15/2009,incredibly excellent idea!
3/15/2009,"while i agree that minmatar bss need work; i just dont like these ideas. tbh, projectiles needs some work too, but lets not worry about that. if we were to just change the ships themselves, i see a breakdown something like this.btw, im not a mathematician, so im sure the values ive listed need some work (especially when it comes to mass). the basic idea is this typhoon = slow, heavy tank or heavy damage.tempest = very fast and agile, sound damage with turrets alone, passive shield tanker.maelstrom = dedicated fleet ship, very high alpha, competitive range.so whatever the values need to be to make that realistic and fair.typhoon:the first in the minmatar line of battleships was born from desperate times. advanced subsystems and reliable sources for component parts were not then consistently available to the republic. the typhoon, therefore, was built on a simple, modular, but sturdy structural design and employed the whatever we can bolt to the hull weapons philosophy. though the phoon does not have fancy defensive systems or sophisticated weapons optimizations, it makes up for that lack of refinement with thick armor and an abundance of weapon hardpoints.changes:5/5 turrets/launchersshields: 5469armor: 6641structure: 6211mass: 105,200,000velocity: 105tempest:with increasing access to more sophisticated subsystem and the emergence of the move fast and hit hard minmatar philosophy, the tempest was designed to be a nimble, turret based skirmisher capable outmaneuvering other battleships. in order to achieve unparalleled mobility in a battleship class vessel, structure and armor we traded for more advanced shielded systems reverse engineered from destroyed caldari vessels. moreover, because the ship needed to move in and out of engagements quickly, weapon subsystems were focused on a fast firing turret based delivery system.changes:5% damage to large projectile turrets7.5% rof to large projectile turrets6/0 turrets/launchers8/6/5 slot layoutcpu: 560pg: 1450shields: 7500shield recharge: 2000armor: 5469structure: 5469mass: 96,000,000velocity: 135maelstrom:now established, the minmatar republic has found itself engaging in more traditional fleet vs fleet conflicts. military leaders recognized the need to have bs capable of engaging at fleet ranges, but still wanted a ship that fit the matari philosophy that a good offence is the best defensehit them hard first, and you wont have to tank them.changes:5% damage bonus7.5% optimalmass: 100,100,000signature radius: 440locking range: 83pg: 2700"

3/15/2009,"tier 2 carriers would lay somewhere between a current carrier and a mom (with carrier 2 being the required skill, hence tier 2)especially, they would be specialised, ie, one would have more damage, less tank and less range, another would have more range, less of the rest as so you had a little variety in the cap ship line up."
3/15/2009,"so what would you propose for fixing a currently broken class instead of putting hundreds of manhours in to put a new class in because ""you dont think its fit for it"""
3/15/2009,"your fix is to just improve it's current role, which is what people don't like. the problem with moms is that their role is pointless for their cost when carriers are far cheaper for similar effect. not to mention that it's not easy to swap b/t a mom and another ship. moms need advanced roles that make them the mobile platforms they were designed to be. they and titans are ment to be mobile bases and at the forefront of front line action. right now, they're the big bully that can't take a hit or do more than swing wildly."
3/15/2009,and i am telling you your idea would make them virtually unkillable in low sec or against any but well coordinated groups in 0.0 thanks to the other buffs you want them to have(better coordinated than your alliance)
3/15/2009,pretty much this
3/15/2009,wait... yaay i know you're an idiot but do you really not see the point in having motherships move in triage?
3/15/2009,"yes i get it, you want it to be a moving ******ed ship with more repping and virtually no other abilities rather than a stationary one... it still does not make this ship independent of carriers in any real way. to make the ship viable, it has to be useful to fleets of people as it's designed as such. even with movable triage, it doesn't make it distinguished from a carrier.... it's just a glorified repping ship. carriers do it cheaper and with insurance and with the option to swap ships easily. motherships need a more useful role to fleets, and making them a mobile station with fleet jumping abilities like the below link with harder tanks makes them more useful to people. right now, they're just giant targets for dreads and fleets to pop shot and grief people for. their only real bonus is related to sovereignty, not even the ship.it's the same ******ed argument as giving titans siege... sure it gives them defense, but at the cost making it just a glorified dread for 45x the cost."
3/15/2009,"so why not give the mobile station role to the ship ccp has repeatedly called a mobile station, the titan? motherships are carriers, much in the same way titans are not dreads so your attempt at relating the two is wrong. when i go into the market and click on carriers, guess what! motherships are there too, for motherships at tier 2 carriers. trying to make them something ""radically different"" simply because titans are unlike dreads(titan doesnt even require the dread skill) is misguided. also do you *really* think giving supercaps a 75% bonus resists is balanced in any way at all?"
3/15/2009,yeah uh xttz did this all the time and it's even easier now so shut up you're the dumbest mothership pilot in goonswarm. perhaps in all of eve
3/15/2009,not when bs fleets and dread fleets are what they have become today. these 300-400 man bs fleets and 100+ dreads fleets would melt you before you went back in.stop trying to troll bu :)

3/15/2009,"ya this would be nice, but how ******ed would undock games in a ms be? i mean come on :) i guess not much more than in a carrier except i am probably easier to bump.alternatively i can dock and slam any carrier playing undock games waaaay out of dock range just by undocking. but seriously the fact we are the same size as a phoenix but are unable to dock because we are too big is a bit weird"
3/15/2009,"what would be more interesting would be to change warfare modules to provide area effects around ships. (and possibly remove warefare booster effects out of fleet structure)then you make the command ships, motherships and titians give varying multiplier bonuses to the module effectiveness and range.if you make mother ship bonuses and range sufficient enough to boost combat effectiveness of a regular fleet you then may make it very attractive to start getting them into the field and more useful than a carrier.(this of course may break roquals but you you could give them effect raduis of 16au to remedy this)"

3/15/2009,a phoenix is bigger than my wyvern but i cant dock? what gives.
3/15/2009,"bump.... with basically everyone supporting so far... or at least most are remembering to check the ""support"" button"
3/15/2009,i really don't want to see decloaking happen other than by current mechanics.
3/15/2009,"we all know attributes aren't integers, but are modified by the learning skills by +2% per level (+10% at l5 learning).it's confusing for some users, especially now, with attribute remapping, to not be able to see the real attribute values.there is no good reason a 20.52 (19*1.08) or 20.90 (19*1.1) to both display simply as ""20"".please add decimal point display to the attributes in the character sheet."
3/15/2009,"or better, give us the option to turn them on and off - so we can see whichever value we want.supported"
3/15/2009,"either way is fine, i suppose, as long as you at least get the option to see them... hate it when i have to re-explain the hundredth time to some newbie how to calculate them or why he doesn't train as fast as he hoped for and so on..."
3/15/2009,"yes, truncation is a bad way of displaying the information. i even see veterans who are caught out by it now that respecing is possible."
3/15/2009,"i could agree with a slight increase in retrieval chance, but no to lowering the requirement to 4."
3/15/2009,"the huge number of people buying t2 salvagers already seem to think salvage 5 was pretty good not supported, as already stated, pretty much all t2 goods require at least 1 lv5 skill, no effort - no reward"
3/15/2009,"good point.but at skill 5 you be at 30% on a t1 and 32% on a t2. and that is not so impressive anymore. hardly the 40% you made it out to be.compare again to miners: miner i base yield 40m3, miner ii base yield 60m3. i have never heard anyone complain that this 50% increase in yield was overpowered."
3/15/2009,"supporting, because ccp need to stop slapping level 5 skills as pre-reqs on everything just for the hell of it. espeicially on a new player profession like salvaging.tbh i don't care that much about this particular case, but in general, enough with the level 5 pre-reqs already, it's not big and it's not clever."
3/15/2009,"ugh, is that how they work the bonuses? well then yeah i am wrong about that. 2% is barely anything, the 1km range is ok but not that great. problem is that the bonus needs to be multiplicative kinda of like almost all the other skills in eve.they could do something like keep 5%/7% and make the salvaging skill give +100% salvaging chance per level. so salvager i @ level 5 = 30% and salvager ii @ level 5 = 42%. i'd support that, but you have to keep salvaging v for the salvager ii.edit: which is lolol what the op wrote as well. changing to support."
3/15/2009,somewhere in ships and modules it is said by someone that uses the t2's that the bonuses are calculated like this... then it may be the usual poor wording by ccp on the skill.anyone can confirm the values on t1 vs t2 from actually fitting them ?
3/15/2009,"here is a list of the things that need level 4 or less for t2: - every rig in the game. - eccm - ecm modules, and the signal distortion amp - projected ecm - sensor dampeners - sensor backup arrays - webs - target painters - tracking disruptors - warp scrams/disruptors (these only need level 2)and that's just from electronics. there are plenty more in the other sections.from my experience there are a lot more modules requiring only level 4 (sometimes less) than there are that require level 5. i can't be bothered counting up the exact numbers right now, so i can't say for certain which of us is right."
3/15/2009,give us the option to set a fee to send a corpmail. same goes for alliance.said fees go directly to the corp/alliance who set them.

3/15/2009,short: i'd like to be able to scan enemy pilots to see what implants they have in.long:this is a pretty rough version of how to evaluate ransom situations. (there is still lots missing from this).
3/15/2009,or you could just have them pod you...

3/15/2009,"i don't know too many pirates who even use ship scanners when ransoming, i doubt many would use pod scanners either. it's not worth a slot."
3/15/2009,"umm....i really fail to see the point of this scanner. its a lot faster to just lock and shoot rather than lock, scan and then shoot. either way, the pod loses its cash. --isaac"
3/15/2009,another class of carrier is needed. we need a carrier that is just that a carrier. we need a ship that has no done bay what so ever but it has a massive ship main bay. this ship needs to be able to carry ships fitted with pilots in them ready to strike after a jump. just like a real carrier no real offensive ability but its defensive capabilities are something that would make even a 4 dreads in siege mode a pain to take out.
3/15/2009,"i really fail to see the point of this ship. the carrier already does this, so why do we need to have one like this?no support.--isaac"
3/15/2009,more to the point the ms and titan do it better
3/15/2009,no new carriers are needed. thx&bye.
3/15/2009,the carriers we have now are just drone boats. this would be a carrier that can only hold and transport ship with pilots in the ships. with the current carriers pilots must be in space and then remove the ship from the carrier. this would make it so that a task force can be droped into the battle. with out the use of a titan.
3/15/2009,"i've yet to die to a falcon, though i have missed quite a few kills do to them. no, normally i'm the one using the falcon alt and killing people, and its just too powerful. the falcon should be a good tool against an enemy gang, not a lone enemy pilot, unless you are only trying to defend yourself not kill him.and ecm would still prevent someone who is not under fire from attacking. in gangs the primary target will be able to shoot but if everyone else is jammed they would be unable to fire until fired upon. against gangs it would still be an indispensable tool due to it being able to remove multiple people from the fight. it just wouldn't be a trump card for ganking solo players without any risk."
3/15/2009,no support. worst idea for changing falcons and i don't even fly em. this would completely nerf them. --isaac
3/15/2009,so in other words anyone the falcon jams... can shoot at least the falcon.hell what a horrible idea lol.seriously... falcons are annoying but pvp is blob or be blobbed and falcons fail at blobs.worst case scenario the devs simply need to beef up eccm with something useful. sensor boosters are the counter to gallente recons. they arent completely passive relying on the fact that gallente recons are going to be there. that's the problem with eccm. they only work if there's ecm trying to jam you. it's a waste of a slot otherwise. even then with eccm.i personally had a privateer dominix permajammed in my blackbird. while he had 2 eccm overloaded. at least up until i moved my ecm onto his neutral guardian. haha silly empire wardecs. both the domi and guardian died. success.
3/15/2009,didn't you propose an idea against like the op?
3/15/2009,yes the idea is against falcons. but essentially do nothing to the balance of falcon. plus ccp already has stated they want to make eccm more useful. so it's not my idea.
3/15/2009,"i support the concept but not the proposed implementation, i don't think local should be used for such things."
3/15/2009,i don't know where to file this request. forgive me if this isn't it. could we get a separate forum section for w-space exploration? even if it's temporary? it sure would be nice to have everything under a single topic.
3/15/2009,"this is where ccp intends for you to put it.missions & complexesfrom missions to cosmos sites, exploration and complexes, this forum has all you need to get a head start in pve.---but if you think that wormhole space deserves its own special unique snowflake place, you might want to make the suggestion here, since getting csm to do it will take months."

3/16/2009,what was wrong with the old effect? it was pretty cool.
3/16/2009,yes ! defenitly !hopefully rework the old one into the new graphics

3/16/2009,add to the list of things to discuss next week with ccp
3/16/2009,"most certainly needs fixing as it will make supercaps almost impossible to kill.. titan tackled? no problem, warp in a dread or a carrier and watch the titan out accelerate anything else in the game off grid..."
3/16/2009,need fix
3/16/2009,please dear god fix this
3/16/2009,yup. obviously. the desynch this causes too is ridiculous.
3/16/2009,try jumping a rorqual and jump freighter at same time. woo hoo bump city.
3/16/2009,"yah, at this point, the capital bumping is beyond stupid. you can't even cyno in to a system, or do a capital warp in, without bumping capitals 50km away from each other. if ccp actually intended this, than it's obvious they have no one on the dev team that actually flies capital ships in real combat."
3/16/2009,supporting
3/16/2009,hooray for unintended consequences.
3/16/2009,"so *that* is what happened to me on the jita undock, my fenrir got rammed back underneath it when another freighter undocked right in front of me."
3/16/2009,while i'm happy to build capitals for people that lose them this seems like a to easy way to take out capitals
3/16/2009,this seems like an easy 0.01 patch inclusion.
3/16/2009,i don't even fly capitals but this is just dumb and broken.

3/16/2009,i suspect that capships bumping to 400km from where they warped/cyno'd isn't an intended feature of the new patch.(please fix this ccp before i dare to undock my carrier)
3/16/2009,"i'm gonna bump this.just had a aaa freighter vanish while in hull.for every 2 people that actually has a propper disconnect, you have entire fleets logging off to avoid combat. this is a bad mechanic. fix it"
3/16/2009,"agreed, limitations on size shouldnt be an issue anymore.i think a lot of the scale could do with a look over, but absolutely when it comes to carriers/stations their just to small!where the dreads/titans dont (couldnt?) fit ships inside so thay look right as they are. i always amused at the fact u can fit a mega in a thanatos yet side to side its just not going to happen. same goes for all the carriers/moms though."
3/16/2009,i very much agree with this proposal. make capitals capital sized
3/16/2009,"im sure i already posted this in the assembley hall but either way im going to support this, though i honestly think all ships need a rescaling"
3/16/2009,bump!and what way should we go. buff the missile it self or add a bonus too the ships that use it?
3/16/2009,"dreads arent supposed to be bigger, better bs. they are anti cap and tower ships. they dont need scaling for sub bs. you're supposed to deploy them with support"
3/16/2009,i agree that the explosion velocity is crippling. the problem is that all the other capital weapons systems have a long-range lower dps and short range higher dps version but not for missiles. a citadel cruise missile launcher is needed and damage done needs to be based more on signature radius and less on speed. this will mean that as long as you're not using an mwd on your bs you should not get wtf ganked. plus the phoenix would be useful at shooting other capital ships.
3/16/2009,"it should be noted that objects one can siege are supposed to be immobile. if your target is mobile, you shouldn't be in siege mode. i thought that was obvious."
3/16/2009,nice idea.

3/16/2009,sporting tha cause!
3/16/2009,i would like the option to inject a skill into my character without needing to meet the its prerequisite skills.naturally if you inject a skill before meeting its prerequisites then you will not be able to train it until you have trained the prerequisites. you will also not be able to place it into your skill queue until all the prerequisites are either trained or queued up before it.your thoughts ?
3/16/2009,this would be nice but something tells me this is one of the reasons the devs didnt want to put the queue in the first place. hope i am wrong
3/16/2009,sounds good. not very important though.
3/16/2009,"i'm not going to badger the op or insult his intelligence. but in eve there is a stigma that pirates are around every corner, crouched and ready to pounce should one cross that high sec/low sec line.while this may be in some systems, for the most part it's just not true. there are even some systems that don't see a single player for days.the ironic thing is the low sec systems that border high sec usually see the most pirate activity. the deeper you go the less activity you'll encounter.but i do agree that the risk vs reward ratio needs to be improved."
3/16/2009,"disincentives to people staying in high sec will not make them move to low or null sec, it will make them unsubscribe. this is not in ccp's interests. the problem with low sec is that the name is misleading. low sec combines the disadvantages of high and null sec without providing any real advantage in return. high sec policing is provided by concord. in null sec it's provided by players. but you can't lock down a system with bubbles on the gates in low sec, and you can't practice nbsi there without eventually losing your access to high sec."
3/16/2009,"incentives won't do anything...i've been in 0.0, low sec and enjoyed myself....but having become a first time dad in real life i now spend my time in high sec as i just like to chat to friends make new friends mine or run missions in what little time i have spare to play.eve is best in the diversity it offers in the way it gives you a very good choice of area's to make isk. very like real life you make your choices and either live life in the fast lane adrenaline pumping as you keep an eye on your overview for pirates trying to jump you in 0.0 or low secor you play safe and run missions or mine in high sec in an npc corp so u can't be war dec'dat the end of the day incentives just unbalance the game as it's about choice and making your own opportunities or working with others to do it..jump in a frigate with a jumpclone and no implants, make sure your clone upgrade is upto date fit a cloak and go explore theres plenty of systems out there in low sec that are quiet and off the beaten track u just have to find them!!!! same in 0.0 not all of 0.0 is taken and if u look hard enough u'll find somewhere....anyway not supported"

3/16/2009,one other thing fix pos's so they can be set-up for better usage at alliance level ie: allow the option to set a corp hanger array for alliance member usage as currently it don't work and it's annoying.....
3/16/2009,sort of agree. yes for prototype cloaking device.difficult to detect improved cloaking device.impossible to detect covert ops cloaking device.i would like to see a cloak jammer similar to how a cyno jammer works. but only if the cloak jammer shows up like a beacon on the overview for everyone to see.
3/16/2009,allow to set some default container to fitting screen so it would try to fetch modules from there?
3/16/2009,yesterday i saw my first post-patch heavy interdictor bubble. i really had to look for it and it was almost impossible to tell where the edges of the bubble were. i could see a faint swirly patterns coming from the ship itself and getting fainter as it moved out. more visibility is needed. pilots should know when they are inside a bubble.
3/16/2009,yes i can not see the bubbles eitheralso anchored bubbles nolonger appear on the overview which is another bad change
3/16/2009,"out of curiosity - how many of those who are screaming ""omgz! cens0rship!!!!elventyone"" actually looked at the linked picture?don't just go ""i know the quafe girl, so i don't have to look at the picture.""look at it. then tell me why you think this is suitable for eve or any game not specifically designed with adult content.suggestive poses and text which leaves a lot to the imagination is fine - but this doesn't leave much to the imagination."
3/16/2009,"actually, the 14-18 age bracket (at least in the us) is one of the most lucrative for any kind of gamin because they have the largest percentage of disposable income - that is, all of it. they don't pay bills, they don't have mortgages, and they don't (hopefully) have kids to feed and clothe. so they're free to spend their money on whatever strikes their fancy, be it eve, wow, or itunes downloads. my 14 year old routinely spends his allowance/birthday/holiday money on cellphone cards and itunes downloads cards.from a purely business perspective, it makes perfect sense for ccp to try and get a slice of that. the price of that, of course, is that you have to make the games palatable to mommy and daddy (and to an extent, the retailers). yes, i am one of those horribly unreasonable parents that won't let her kids play grand theft auto or any of the other blatantly violent/adult games. halo? sure. shoot all the aliens you like dear, just don't get any on my carpet. hookers? ah..no. i am quite sure they get enough of that crap at school (sadly enough)."
3/16/2009,i'm pretty sure that they needed the game to be rated by the esrb to get onto shelves in the shops.
3/16/2009,make it so concord wont defend your **** unless you have certain standings with the entity who's space youre in or you pay a certain amount of isk per week. if you do not have the proper standings you get a special flag but attacking those players still drops your sec standing. standings would degrade over time so you cant just grind up and stop. characters under a certain age would be immuneyou would be able to contract sec standing to other people at whatever price you saw fitthere would be a several month warning of this so nobody can claim they were caught with their pants down.this would make the line between empire and lowsec less defined and cause pvp to be more widespread but still give people the ability to opt out while in high sec. and create another isk sink in eve that there are so many threads crying about.

3/16/2009,this post makes me hope the rats start warping in slower.
3/16/2009,the idea is to be constructive...take your pathetic whines elsewhere.
3/16/2009,so all the belts i land in with rats already in them are....figments of my imagination?i sense an epic fail of a thread starting here.
3/16/2009,"while i hate the farmer ravens in 0.0, there are a couple things i am concerned about:1) the new npc warp in creates a delay that reduces overall profits of npcing in 0.0. thus it is a slight (just a small) discouragement of going to 0.0 instead of doing level 4s in empire. and i was under impression that we needed the 0.0 rewards improved against the empire. it's not a big deal but it is noticeable2) i noticed an increase in desync's occurring when killing npcs. i suspect it has to do with new bumping mechanics and the fact that when npcs warp to a belt, then don't have the 2.5 km random spread like player warp does. they all warp to same point. that makes them bump each other and cause desync, it also happens if they warp into roids."
3/16/2009,"e .<U+FFFD> ` ' / <U+FFFD>. f tears, the new jump-fuel."

3/16/2009,good idear....one problem. ship recognition!t1 ships are bland and easy to identfyt2 ships have 2 distinct couler varents (for amarr: red plating/onyx hulls) these indicate the ship specific desing. onyx hull= missile hard points/ red plating= turret hard points.pluss ships are coulerds by there manufacturers (ore/creodron ect...)
3/16/2009,"the interbus shuttle is using the same texture as a normal gallente shuttle, and the ib logo is pasted on it as a decal of sorts, and is not part of the texture.the kronos, megathron, navy mega and so on all use the same textures too.this uses the original navitas texture. where is the blue?ccp would be lying if they say that ship painting and logos is impossible, because they're already doing that. all the blue on gallente ships isn't there by default. it won't add any lag anymore than flying a kronos or navy megathron or interbus shuttle does."
3/16/2009,"1. spell check.2. you're wrong, if you make it cost a significant sum of money to color up your ships, you create another money sink, as well as more color varients.anyway, i personally love gallente ships, but hate the tealish colors they spray on everything. the ability to make them blood red (enyo) or maybe a black (like the navy mega) would make my fraking day."
3/16/2009,either the module needs a major boost or the required skill should be reduced
3/16/2009,"should be dropped to level 4 requirements. it's pointless to get literally a 7% bonus over level 4 skill with t1 salvager.level 5 salvaging gives you another 5%, the salvager gives you an extra 2%, for a grand total of 7%. considering i already have 70% chance, spending the time to train to level 5 and buy the salvager iis for what.. 10% overall bonus.. i think not..70% chance based on:-level 4 skillsalvager tackler ii x3hardwiring implants"

3/16/2009,this might actually be a good idea.
3/16/2009,"given that a thorough overhaul to the mail system is already in the works, i can't imagine this is worth doing as a stopgap - it'd be too much work and not last long enough as a solution. better than the status quo, yes, but i'd rather just have a real mail client than one token fix to the thoroughly broken status quo."

3/16/2009,"ccp has stated before that the reason we don't have ships that are mobile stations in themselves is due to complications. if the ship blows up, what happens to the other members in the ship and the ships they're in (if applicable). if the pilot disconnects, what happens to them then? what about the people who logged off in the ship before it was destroyed?the issues are going to be hard to fix, and the whining will be immense if they do implement that. don't get me wrong, i'd like to see 'gunners' and such, but it's not likely to happen.and regarding the 'carrier', we have many already. there are 8 different carriers alone, not to mention the rorqual and orca which can haul ships. yes, carriers have drone bays. get used to it, because it's not gonna change anytime soon."
3/16/2009,"disagree with needing another carrier class... however, you could get around 'multiple pilots' within carriers. carrier dies: all ships ejected (with or without pilots). carrier pilot logs off: all online pilots are ejected. pilots can not log off inside a carrier, must log off in space.would really make for some exciting uses if you could have pilots in ships inside carriers/motherships.... could 'jump' with carrier if docked inside too, awesome. not like you can stuff a battleship fleet in them, or too damn many hacs carrier jumps in solo and local says 7 hostiles just entered... guess whativory"
3/16/2009,how would plexes be implemented in a multi account setup?
3/16/2009,"i think the difference is speed got perpetually more unfair with each new way to increase it. it wasn't that someone hopped in a hac one day and became invincible for years and oh by the way, they were still killable, it was just annoying.t2 bpos, by contrast, are doing nothing differently then when they were first developed. leave them in, let them go, honestly we could probably do well with more t2 bpos once the frontier/invention tech reaches t3."

3/17/2009,"i still prefer active tanking twice that, no matter if i am at full shields or no shields, while also having a web, a scram, and four gyros, while in an inexpensive fit thanks to dirt cheap shield resist rigs. unless you are able to do the math on active tanking, my advice is to leave my ship's shield bonus the **** alone.your passive recharge fit would be terrible in any pvp situation. much better to go for shield hp if that was the bonus instead, and get well over 250k ehp while still doing good damage. i still prefer an active tank however."
3/17/2009,"i approve of this product and/or service :)i support the idea of giving the ability to move while in triage as well as the majority of the other bonuses, with the current mechanics they dont really serve much of a purpose for the isk they cost"
3/17/2009,"i gave this subject some thought and return with a few ideas as ed suggested. probably not great, but something is better than nothing to think about/debate.general ideas:- create a capital smart bomb only for motherships: 20km rng, 15k omni dmg, 5-10min cycle time (mini-dd)- can portal x-# of ships based on sma volume, ie. 5 bs's, 20-ish hac... but maybe limit it to 10 players can portal max, even if its just shuttles- increase sma to be double. motherships are hinted at being a 'mobile base' for colonization, so let them carry more haulers, barges, ships in general. increase in corp hanger array isn't bad either to store more 'colonization' stuff.- add bonus like: +10%/lvl cap reduction of remote transfers and/or +10% transfer amount. at least make them a superior remote repper than carriersall of these are independent suggestions, or mix/match a few of them in with current bonus's. just throwing a few ideas out here on a subject that needs attention.ivory"
3/17/2009,"1) add new mothership-only fighter types that do no damage, but are capable of providing combat bonuses to ships they're assigned to. * templar ii - mid-range energy vampire. drains energy from hostile target and transfers to assigned vessel. range bonus increased by amarr carrier skill when flying aeon.* dragonfly ii - long range electronic warfare. provides remote eccm boost to assigned vessel and has a mid-long range multispec ecm. very slow movement speed. range bonus increased by caldari carrier skill when flying wyvern.* firbolg ii - close range tackler. provides tracking/optimal bonus to assigned ship. disruptor range and tracking speed bonus increased by gallente carrier skill when flying nyx.* einherji ii - logistics fighter. transfers armour and shield hitpoints to assigned vessel. transfer amount increased by minmatar carrier skill when flying hel.2) reduce 5 minute cooldown on remote ecm burst by 10-15% per level of racial carrier. prevent remote ecm burst use in triage mode.now you have a reason to put motherships on grid with hostiles.3) 90% reduction in triage cycle time role bonus and 95% reduction in stront usage. alternatively provide a different (tech 2?) triage module for motherships that only improves their remote transfer modules and does not have a movement penalty nor prevents them from recieving remote reps.another reason to put motherships on grid with hostiles.4) increase sma capacity and fix clone vat bay to actually be a usable module.your mothership is now a viable vessel."
3/17/2009,oh and let us lock our ****ing sma's with a password. im tired of having to check my sma to make sure nothing was stolen everytime someone gets close because i can't stop anyone in my corp from taking stuff out of it.
3/17/2009,"this is as much a general carrier issue as it is a mothership one (although obviously motherships have it potentially worse with the larger smas and, in theory, clone vats*)*in theory"
3/17/2009,"currently fly a nidhoggur, and getting into a nag next week, tbh i have no issues with the nidhoggur, could use slightly more cap and a little more pg/cpu, but its nothing gamebreaking really, it remote reps like a mofo and serves its purpose.the hel has issues, but thats not a racial thing, all motherships need addressing as much as each other, so not really going to discuss it here. ragnaroks gang bonus is pretty crappy, but really, as oveur said, it's just a big ****, if you're flying it solely for the gang bonuses you have bigger problems.the main issue that everyone can agree with is the nag, tbh i would be very happy if they did something(anything) to increase the dps, i'm happy if it means i have a slightly sub par tank, but for that i expect to be top damage, not 2nd from the bottom. i quite liked mia kahns idea of making it into a bit of a big tempest, though the comments in regards to the autocannons are as much of an issue with all races really.anyhoo, some sort of update in regards to the issue would be nice, and this threead gets my support :)"
3/17/2009,sweet christmas.
3/17/2009,"/signed, this cant possibly be working as intended, warp into a pos and spend 20 minutes getting the dreads in position, not cool."
3/17/2009,"not sure if i've supported this yet, but i do.i'd like to see aggro prevent people from vanishing regardless of whether or not they're currently logged in."
3/17/2009,"so, exactly what does it take to get csm attention to this matter?"
3/17/2009,"regarding op's scenario, sounds like some kind of desync problem - i noticed a lot more of those since last big patchi do support rewriting of logoff mechanics - to make them more favorable to pvper. it gets pretty bad right now with some of the tricks people pull, like:*) loging off, then logging in a minute later and immediately log off again, then log in again and warp to a safe point instead of the original place of log off*) in some cases, log off makes ship invulnerable to lock*) people jumping into systems and logging off at same time - gives attackers only 30 second window to destroy them*) people logging off as soon as they see that they are about to get tackled, thus by-passing the aggro timer by a couple seconds, giving attackers just 1 minute to destroy them (if they don't get hit by the invulnerable to lock bug)the most important change, in my opinion, is to make it so people can get aggro timer during the 1 minute their ship remains in space without aggro. basically - if anyone shoots a ship, it gets aggro, doesn't matter if the char is logged in or not.this would have most significant impact on people who abuse log off mechanics to save ships, while having little negative impact on people who have real connection problems."

3/17/2009,"quoting this :) the fact that when zommed out with brackets turned off i can get a hyperion confused with the carriers its parked near is a bit of a problem, though there really are much more pressing issues out there"
3/17/2009,"yes please, i want my dread / carrier to look like it barely fits in a stations hanger, and i want my ms to look like it cant fit and would destroy half the station if it ran into it."
3/17/2009,yes time for the super sizing to begin. size does matter
3/17/2009,"yes, yes. quite."
3/17/2009,a titan speed-tanking citadel torps - that's just ridiculous.

3/17/2009,"i like this - it lets a queue work much more effectively. i won't be surprised if ccp shoots it down, but it's certainly worth inquiring into."
3/17/2009,"removes all risk of transporting skillbooks... if the idea was to inject skillbooks that had the prereqs already in the skill queue i'd be all for it tho sorry, no support from me"
3/17/2009,supported...if i want to make a queue that includes something i can train in..5 hours..i can't..a bit stupid.
3/17/2009,transporting skillbooks? honestly you may as well remove them as items - one would think they'd be available online. we're in freaking space.
3/17/2009,"the pubbie-tears theatre company proudly presents, 'why this won't happen'.newbie: look at me ma, i'm injecting heavy assault cruisersnewbie: omfg, i can't train, petitiongm : you don't have the pre-reqs, have a nice day.newbie: what! why did it let me waste isk to 'inject' the book! now i'm space poor, and i can't sell the skill! /ragequitthe queue is only 24hrs long anyway, just wait a day and use a jita jump clone to buy skills so you never have to worry about transportation."
3/17/2009,"yes, that would be why the game has warning messages. besides, this isn't about transportation for most players, it's about using the queue to its best effect."
3/17/2009,"sorry, not supported. while it sounds logical and would be handy to have there's too many downsides/issues with it, some have been mentioned already."
3/17/2009,no support - due to removing the risk associated with transporting expensive skill books.
3/17/2009,not supported... adds to the lazy man effect.
3/17/2009,"apart from importers/exporters (who this doesn't affect anyway), who the hell are all these people transporting skill books about the place?why are people buying books they don't yet need (apart from maybe a handful of new players who don't understand the mechanics and haven't yet trained jumpclones and are anyway futzing about in high sec)?anyone flying skill books around 0.0 or low sec without the intention to sell them on is a crazy person who should seek professional help.seriously."
3/17/2009,"it wouldn't make you warp faster. that is correct.its utility would be great, though."
3/17/2009,"true, but more hotkeys are always a good thing. far too many worthless hotkey options when we could really use a system where you can map almost any action to any key. that would be awesome."
3/17/2009,what he said.to op: you can't be serious.
3/17/2009,"op is basically saying he doesn't like macgyver, time to break out the pitchforks and torches."
3/17/2009,"minor, but i can see it being really handy. that said, could well be a bear to code - i don't know how the code, interface, or database would work for having default containers in every station to draw modules from. maybe just have a pair of checkboxes - ""check containers?"" and ""check corporate hangars?"" that players can use to at least get most of the functionality you ask for without it being too much of a nightmare for ccp to code."
3/17/2009,"how about ""check open containers for fitting"" ?"
3/17/2009,"this. although i disagree, i see no problem with adult content in eve. the average player is 25 or older i believe. even if seedy bars were implemented with ambulation, you could still choose to not go into them.i disagree since everytime you sign on the esrb says content online differs. it's kind of a big joke really, since theres no single player content to rate!esrb ratings have always been off for mmos since theres no way to fully regulate the behavoir of humans who have privacy and the freedom to say and do things they normally would not.while the post that caused this red scare was bogus, and an excellent troll i might add, the issue of censorship is null here. so stop getting scared people. ccp has shown no signs of making this a kiddy game. yet."
3/17/2009,"no, no, no. isk sinks aren't needed, searching standings as an integral part of combat is terrible gameplay, and ccp will never implement any system that makes the highsec-loving players, a majority of their income, stop playing the game."
3/17/2009,ya but its sure fun to freak them out
3/17/2009,"heh. privatize concord, and make standings matter for things like response times. pvpers would have to check up on their targets to see how well-liked they are by the local police. kind of like an empire tax for protection."
3/17/2009,"no. no support at all. high-sec is made to be safe. no if, ands or buts. --isaac"
3/17/2009,lay off the drugs you silly goon.go back to delve and pew pew... less stupid ideas.
3/17/2009,"supported:this problem cuts into the heart of the disparity in empire/0.0 productivity discord. 0.0 industrialists either have a time or isk drawback at establishing their own protective cartels, whereas empire is given it for free. either 0.0 manufacturing has to be raised in productivity and efficiency, or empire productivity needs to be hampered through methods such as this."

3/17/2009,so bickering caused me to lose any sort of edge by bickering and you quickly follow that statement up with *that*.truly genius. but thanks for the bump :) more bumps whining are appreciated
3/17/2009,whats genius is the fact you fail to recognize that not everyone has an entire alliance with massive manufacturing capabilities at there disposal.any credence you had... goes right out the door.but your not smart enough to figure that out... as efrim so eloquently pointed out.

3/17/2009,it was discussed and according to the minutes from the meeting with ccp they agreed to look at it when they review those ships.
3/17/2009,"thanks for the quick response, oz. i knew i voted for you for a reason!i looked through the minutes and found no mention of it. are these minutes you're referring to public yet? or have they yet to be released?"

3/17/2009,you mean the results from the boost sisi issue might be posted as well....**** me you guys are fast these days.
3/17/2009,"wow, pretty freaking stupid given the fact that the nighthawk is designed from the ground up to be an anti-support platform. not one range bonus for missiles, and it's designed to take down smaller targets, but it's not supposed to fit an mwd.amazing."
3/17/2009,"guess this isn't much of a hot topic... meh.considering how little work it is to do (i can only assume), and considering the benefits, i wonder..."
3/17/2009,sounds logical. before attrib respecs it really wasn't an issue but now that we can alter our attribs it just makes sense to see the actual value rather than just an integer.

3/17/2009,"this is something i'd love to see too... but limited i think too corp and alliance colour schemes that should cut down on any issues of lag and npc corps should be given just the basic scheme.1) at alliance level apply the colour scheme and alliance logo (changeable only by ceo of exec corp)2) at corp level the same ability to set a corp colour scheme and apply the corp badge too the ships. ( changeable only by ceo )3) give the players the choice when in a corp in an alliance whether to have the corp colour scheme or the alliance colour scheme but with both badges on.making it simple:like the current badge design process:a) limited colours ie: black, red, blue, gold, yellow, silver, green and orangeb) limited areas painted ie: main hull, sub hull 1 and sub hull 2c) corp badge and alliance badge location to be set in appropiate place for all ships with no player ability to change.as mentioned it's the clientside that renders the graphics so to limit the information make the corp and alliance color schemes only changeable once a month that way your not overloading anything and also allow the ability for players to turn off corp and alliance colour schemes in the client graphics section. this only turns it off on there screen and those of us who like realism within the game can leave it on :)"
3/17/2009,"jesus guys i have no issues with macro miners, they make an easy target for flipping /me then pockets the ore"
3/17/2009,only issue i have with macro miners is if they are farming for an organisation in rl that is making a profit in rl money on what they mine.... ie: isk sellers..forget trying to spot macro miners just catch the people selling and buying isk in breach of the eula as they are the ones ruining the game.... at least with gtc trading the majority of the money paid for the gtc goes back to eve and is reinvested in the continuing development of the game.... wheres isk sellers don't put anything back into the game but do affect the internal prices of items on the market as peeps who buy isk will buy at over inflated prices so stopping the cost of items coming down to more reasonable prices....i've never used a macro and never will and i run 3 characters at once mining ice or ore in high sec.... i ignore local most of the time as i am usually chatting in alliance or corp chat too m8's whilst also watching tv or a film.... and to be honest most convo's in local in high sec are nothing but spam or something else i have no interest in.one thing for sure am glad of is the orca as now i don't have to worry about thieves flipping my can... overall as many others have said on here there is no way to catagorise a miner as a macroer 100% and thats what u would need to do to be able to ban a player as otherwise ccp would end up alienating a part of there customers and no company wants to do that....
3/17/2009,"with the exception of primary weapons systems and hulls, pretty much anything t2 that has been in the game a long while has level 4 for t2, any recent t2 has gone in at level 5, because like all mmog developers, ccp eventually caught the grind bug.it's the same lazy design approach that leads developers to concentrate on t3 and cap ships rather than adding more options at t1 and t2."

3/17/2009,i have made in the feature & ideas forum a posting regarding alt training (didn't see this thread before):
3/17/2009,"council of stellar managementmeeting minutesdownload: pdf | raw log pdfsunday 16th march 2009present: ankhesentepemkah, bunyip, darius johnson, issler dainze, lavista vista, omber zombie (late), pattern clarc, tusko hopkins, vuk lau, meissa anunthiel, extreme, sophie dagneauapologies: noneabsent: nonespecial meeting regarding apocrypha discussion issue passed in previous meeting  items raised to be voted on as to whether they should be discussed with ccp1. capital ships collision mechanicsin raw text from [ 2009.03.15 16:02:59 ]vuk introduced the issue.issler and pattern asked for a clarification of why it happened.darius explained that after ccp changed the collision calculation, capitals mass meant that if they hit each other they bumped a huge distance.issler thought it needed to be fixed asap.pattern noted that he thought ccp rushed the expansion and that ccp need to assure the players it wont happen again.bunyip added that it was rushed due to the retail box, but agreed it shouldnt have happened.tusko pointed out that launch date was a business decision and there is no point in raising that as an issue.darius noted that the meeting was going off topic and that opinions about testing were irrelevant.pattern vehemently disagreed.darius politely asked pattern to get over it.vote: 8-0 pass2. epic mission arcsin raw text from [ 2009.03.15 16:15:11 ]ankhe introduced the issue.bunyip thought that while ccp had a lot of new things to include in this patch, he understood that ccp were testing the water with only one epic mission, however he agrees that the system needs to be looked at.issler agreed that a single start point seemed broken, and only one epic arc seemed broken too, which is boring, but that was the nature of missions. issler also noted that box art and words seemed to promise a lot of things that arent actually in the game, including being an artist.pattern noted that he didnt think we should be voting on anything, just prioritizing them and this all could have been done via email. he was happy ankhe explained the issue and is happy to bump it up the priority.vuk pointed out that email is not a great communication system currently and people disagree with various points.darius asked if it was possible to stay on a single topic.vuk wanted to know if it was true that only 2 empires were covered with the mission arc.ankhe said only caldari and minmatar to any great extent, the rest minor inclusions.bunyip thought it looked like they took the diploma mission and extended it 10 fold.ankhe wanted to discuss what the csm position on epic missions were, in her opinion they were crap and needed 6months of work.darius asked why that wasnt figured out before this meeting.oz arrivedcontinued next post"
3/17/2009,"chaos ensued for a little while.after a brief discussion about what exactly the point of this discussion was about was had.ankhe wanted the csm to have a position of epic missions suckoz noted he didnt think they sucked.vuk reclaimed chair status.issler wanted to hear what oz thought of the topic.pattern asked if csm could agree with the position that the current epic mission arc was not good enough.oz agreed that the epic mission released was not good enough, but thought that ccp already knew this and it was a test run of the epic mission creation system, not an end product. comparing this single mission to a complete epic mission editing system was stupid and a waste of time.vuk thought that even if this was just a test of the epic mission system, problems should still be taken to ccp.vuk called for a vote.oz asked for a clarification of what exactly the csm was voting on: the epic mission arc, or the epic mission system.both was the answervote: 9-0 pass (with reservations from oz, lavista and darius)3. sleeper aiin raw text from [ 2009.03.15 16:44:27 ]ankhe introduced the topic.issler thought it looked like a balance issue and wasnt sure there was much value of raising it as a topic as ccp would be monitoring and tweaking it.darius thought that sleepers were acting as intended. if a setup wasnt working, use a different one, players dont have a right to kill everything in game solo or in a preferred setup.ankhe noted its hard to do if gallente.oz had four points: 1. drones are a weapon system and if fighting a drone boat, you disable their drones, its working as intended. 2. sleepers are super npcs, not simple npcs you can afk kill like level 4 missions, working as intended. 3. adapt or die, working as intended. 4. the same as point 3.vuk agreed with darius and oz.pattern noted that ccp said they needed to tweak the frequency that sleepers targeted drones, but drones could also be used to exploit the ai and a cheating ai is an issue. it is considered a low priority by him.tusko questioned if the issue was more to do with why a favored setup cant be used rather than choosing a ship for its task. he is happy that they are not easy to defeat and if cheating is necessary to keep it that way, so be it.bunyip noted that from what he has read they put a lot of balancing effort into drones and it is unlikely they will change that. he has not heard any complaints about it.lavvista agreed with darius and oz.meissa noted that drones didnt work, smaller ones survive but dont deal damage, heavy/sentry drones just get killed instantly. drnes are a weapon system, not ammo, there needs to be some rebalancing.pattern pointed out you can use light drones as a defensive system.vuk called the vote; ankhe disagreed with the need to vote as the topic should just be added.a discussion was had on what needed to be voted on.vote 2-6 fail (ankhe and pattern voted yes, no vote from tusko)4. probingin raw text from [ 2009.03.15 17:00:19 ]meissa introduced the issue.lavista agreed with most of the issues; however he thought the granularity and dead covert ops are working as intended.issler was torn on the topic, while her first experience with probes were bad and a lot of negative posts on the forums say so, a lot of her corp members love the new system. there is room for serious improvement though.bunyip hadnt really heard anything bad about probing, but had a list of things that could be improved:1. disable probes automatically from scan results2. give option to disable some results you may have already scanned3. fix probe movement for fine tuning4. create a shortcut key bind for bookmark this5. wireframe probe widget manipulator should be an option which is off by defaultcontinued next post"
3/17/2009,"6. need a new indicator when probes conflict readingsmeissa asked for a clarification of numbers 4 and 6bookmarking a scanned result needs to have a easier way to get it rather than fly there, bookmark, get out of dodge. something achievable from the solar system map and the small red ring showing a scanned area doesn't give much detail. it needs to be 3d instead of 2d, and show the conflicting readings if possible.meissa thought point 4 was an alternative to the dead covert ops part.oz agreed with lavista and also added that the difficulty in finding the radar/magneto sites was proved to only be hard for non-covert ops ships which he thought was intended. he also thinks remote bookmarking would remove any risk from exploration.issler wanted to know what everyone thought about triangulation.pattern noted it was quadrangulation.meissa pointed out its not triangulation, its all about angles as pattern said.pattern thought the concept was fine, just a few issues with the time taken to scan things down in cluttered systems, mostly balance issues.meissa didnt agree with the risk to covert ops, they should not instantly die when probing down a site. they are fragile and not meant for combat.oz pointed out that covert ops gives you the fastest and easiest way to find sites, not the only way. you can use other ships to find sites which may take longer and require higher skill levels.bunyip thought that maybe covert ops could be the only ships capable of remote bookmarking.meissa thought that ozs assertions were false for radar/magno sites.oz disagreed and gave a setup that would find them.meissa asked if oz was suggesting that people should use a more resilient ship that is not actually designed for the job.vuk pointed out that if a covert ops is too fragile then maybe a non-fragile ship was designed for the job.pattern reiterated that it was probably best that csm get ccps views on this.meissa agreed to edit the topic to include bunyips suggestions and alter the granularity section.oz objected to remote bookmarking ever existing.vuk and issler agreed.vote: 8-0 pass (with oz, vuk and lavista against remote bookmarking, no vote from pattern)5. tech 3in raw text from [ 2009.03.15 17:19:57 ]pattern introduced the issue.issler noted that she had been trying to build a business model around tech 3 and it seemed near impossible as there were too many variables and the ships had questionable value.meissa pointed out that aside from radar/magneto components, the time needed to obtain salvage and gas was minimal and as such, the final price for ships shouldnt be very expensive in the end. ship value is hard to determine at this point because no-one was flying them.oz asked what exactly the point of this discussion was  what did pattern want to talk to ccp about specifically.pattern answered that he had suggestions on how to fix them which hed be releasing later in the week, however he wished to know ccps views and raising the priority of it.oz clarified that the reason he asked was because the first two points of the issue were that the concept was dumb and not balanced, which is fine as an opinion, but not a real question. oz thought the point of this discussion with ccp was to ask them about specific issues not general overall concepts.pattern responded that he is alerting them to a problem and voicing the concerns of the public to them directly as that is part of his role as a csm.meissa pointed out that you could test these ships on singularity, that they werent bad but not necessarily worth the time and isk. meissa also failed to understand why being better than tech 2 was a bad thing.a general discussion as then had about what was available for testing.issler wanted to know if asking ccp to seed tech 3 on singularity was what was being aimed at.continued next post"
3/17/2009,"meissa thought it was premature to put tech 3 issues to ccp when no one has any idea of what they are discussing.issler repeated her question.lavista pointed out that they are seeded.pattern said they were not available on the market like everything else. he also noted that this issue was more than asking for tech 3 to be seeded for testing, it was also about how a whole new feature was added and the playerbase were unhappy about its performance and lack of testing.oz asked how the player base could be unhappy with the performance of something that hadnt been tested or used in game yet.pattern posted 2 forum thread links.ankhe said she noticed missing subsystems but she also thought that tech 3 was unbalanced.issler requested the issue to be defined more clearly; if it was discuss tech 3 then she would agree to it.a brief discussion about the missing 2 subsystems ensued.vote was calledvote: 4-5 fail (yes votes were pattern, ankhe, issler, bunyip)6. sleeper lootin raw text from [ 2009.03.15 17:50:06 ]lavista introduced the issueoz wasnt sure it really was an issue with the sleepers, but wanted to ask ccp why it was introduced for them rather than standard npcs.ankhe thought that as tech 3 looks like it is going bad, they may need this isk to make going to wormhole space worthwhile.issler had no problem with this issue.vote: 7-2 pass (ankhe and sophie said no)7.unfinished expansionsin raw text from [ 2009.03.15 17:59:34 ]ankhe introduced this issue.omber just wanted ankhe to be clear that she wanted ccp to change from their successful business model of expansions to bugfixing. if that was the case, he had no problem with them fixing old issues, but asking ccp to halt expansion was absurd.vuk agreed that eve should continue moving forward, but ccp should consider not having such an aggressive schedule.ankhe pointed out that other successful companies have both a live team and an expansion team which work on their respective contents. she didnt mind ccp working on expansions but didnt want them to release unfinished content. ultima online was an example given of a continuous expansion at the expense of bugfixing.issler thought that ccp knew unfinished expansions were bad, but there was a hard stop on this one due to the retail box. issler was unsure of what to tell ccp other than dont suck which is useless. if ccp dont want to concentrate on missing things, they should go back and remove all the misleading content.ankhe noted she listed things that needed an overhaul and when she said allocate development time that didnt mean scrap expansions altogether.oz pointed out that ankhes exact words in the issue were that ccp should postpone further expansions until old content is fixed and/or completed and that meant she was asking for no further expansions.ankhe noted that postpone didnt mean that ccp shouldnt do it at all.tusko suggested that it be rephrased as finding a more natural balance between bugfixing and expansions.ankhe agreed to the change.a discussion about the development pipeline ensued.vote: 9-0 pass"

3/18/2009,"been posted many times. ccp would need to add a capital ship undock port if they wanted to rescale ships to their actual size.its probably very far down the list of things to do, after ambulation and shiny planets, but it would be nice."

3/18/2009,"does anyone else think that its funny that you can speed tank a dread? at all? really if ther is one thing that a dread can hit it should be another dread,"
3/18/2009,"the issue not dread vs dread. issue dread vs anything that moves and can fight.while the gun dreads will miss a lot. they can land a hit every now and then and deal a nice bit of dmg too a target. while the phoenix can land every hit with it's weapons what good is it when a raven, hell i say a caracal does more dps then you do."
3/18/2009,lolphoenix.this does need looking at. dreads of all sorts should still do loldamage vs a moving bs with good transversal however the numbers need to be adjusted for capital ships.
3/18/2009,"from the point when the ambulation project was announced, ccp have claimed that they are looking for ways of putting it to a good(or any) use. i think it would be great to improve new player experience through the benefits of ambulation.there are a lot of people who love eve not only for internet spaceships but for a very detailed and complex world.and i personally think that ambulation should cover all those pretty things that should happen in eve and which are not directly related to blowing ships in space. :)basicaly idea is following:after creating a character you do not end up in a hanger with a noobship.you start in academy which you have chosen while character creation and before you are shipped to your station with a noobship waiting for ya, lets say you get introduced to aura and get a chance to access loads of holoreel eye-candies with sexeh aura voice on particular parts of eve universe. (background , history , races , weapon types , etc. brief and pretty.)yep i know that there are walls of text and bookworm erotical fantasy on eve website or eve-lopedia, but this scares off a lot of people.when introduced to the game i think best way to get a desire to be part of the universe is getting a brief eye-candy teasing on all aspects either than receiving chineese wall of text with overwhelming ammounts of information. pros +1) puts +1 use to ambulation! (yay!)2) who dosnt want to know how an elite academy for pod-pilots look like? :)3) gives player better feeling of eve universe and particular style,background, and envoirnment of the race they have chosen.4) as i remember some interviews from fanfest , one of the most fancy spectacular ambulation feature (scale of ships in hangar comparing to the avatar) was removed, you can put it in here with some meaning. for instance you academies can be put on a planets (you will be able to look out of the window and see some fancy planet background , which will also give you feeling that eve universe is not just about void space) and after finishing your briefing on a planet you can be shipped to station.5) you getting into pod experience can be described or visualized.6) aura voice is sexeh!cons -1) its not a vital or neccesary feature (fix the lags first and whining like this :d )2) pretty consuming feature for art department considering it non vital (but so is the ambulation itself :d)3) who cares about new people? 4) roleplaying sucks 5) this probably will be better/easier to be ""instanced"" from technical point of view which is considered the greatest ""evil"" in eve.okay now you can throw rocks at me.rly."
3/18/2009,fix'dtry to avoid double negatives in your proposals... confuses the hell out of people.: o)
3/18/2009,with some polishing around the edges...not a terribly bad idea.
3/18/2009,"i won't throw rocks, i agree with you about starting out in an acadamy, or at least the hangar in avatar form. however your cons are all a bit stilted, personally they need to just implement the fraking thing. thats the only thing keeping some of my friends from playing the game.also, linkage to the dev blog where they dropped scaling?"
3/18/2009,i support the idea.

3/18/2009,"good idea, should be a easy fix too."
3/18/2009,"hell yes, why didnt someone think of this earlier?"
3/18/2009,great idea.
3/18/2009,"i like the idea, most of the time people transporting expensive skillbooks are doing so for another character so injecting it will not help. it would make the sq far more usefull."
3/18/2009,"if they quit over that, chances are they will find something else to quit over later.yes, that is an option. but lets say you have a longish plan with multiple levels of pre-reqs. for example training t2 large beams when you don't have any t2 lasers trained.for this example you would have to jumpclone back to jita 3 times. first to get small beam specialisation. then you train to level 4 and jc to get medium beam specialisation. then you train it to 4 and make your third trip to grab large beam specialisation.so that's 3 jumps with a 24 hour wait. meaning you are out of action for 3 days, instead of just 1 if you could inject before meeting the pre-reqs. meaning more time doing what you enjoy doing in eve.thus it rewards planning ahead with your skill training. if you know what you want, you can spend less time waiting for the jump timer to expire because you injected them beforehand."
3/18/2009,"a lot of programming for something not that nessesary.soo no, not really ^^"
3/18/2009,"i like it, but some very good counterarguments have been made, too."
3/18/2009,if you look at an anchored giant can. it says 29days remaining or whatever. how about a jetcan timer so you know when it will pop. x minutes.
3/18/2009,everyone knows these cans expire in 2 hours.why make it any harder than it is on the dev's?seriously... try to put a little more effort into thinking and less time on just meeting your quota ok?
3/18/2009,"it's not a ridiculous request. it's simple - it's something that the servers already keep track of and just don't display to the end user.the workaround that everyone uses is to name their cans with the time it was created. which works. it would be convenient if it were automated.it's a very minor issue, but people who deal with jetcans frequently would appreciate it.supported."
3/18/2009,"style over content it seems. aside of causing headaches for those who spend a lot of time around them, and making people seasick with the fluctuating shield bubble, the new effect interferes with numerous other mechanics, particularly visual effects. things that spring to mind are warp disruptor effects, bubbles, nos effects, etc. these more or less depend on the colour setting of the space background of a system, but more often then not it is pretty hard to identify **** happening in a visual sense. as was pointed out elsewhere, anybody who has to zoom out to maintain overview can't see what he or she is doing. never mind what anyone is doing in space behind the pos itself.pos shields used to be nice and calm, and not visually disruptive. now they are severely in the way of the experience. there's even reports of csm who want to hurt kittens when they warp to a pos, and we really cannot have that (i'm perfectly fine with csm folks hurting people and/or stuff, this is eve, just not kittens).it strikes a lot of us as a case of favoring style over content, design over usability. sure, it looks great the first time, but once you're working in or around them it gets severely in the way.as such, it would be an example of sanity and common sense to drop the new visuals. however, since this cannot be done for reasons of marketing and juicy advertising screenies, i would settle for an option to just turn the thing off, showing not the cheesy eyecandy but a normal low res static bubble.to clarify: we do not want to throw the current bubble in the trash, but we really could use an option to turn the thing off (possibly switch to a low res static alternative)."
3/18/2009,"simply confirmed.i work with some poses, and normaly im zoomed out, but now with ..how you call it... premium lite, it's a marple ball, and i can't see what i'm doing.please move back to the old grapics, they where perfect."
3/18/2009,"i agree. we are living out of a pos and the new model is very annoying. please bring back the old one.the previous one was calm and neutral, i feel like we live in the centre of a storm now."
3/18/2009,thumbs up from me. new shield graphics are out of place and annoying.
3/18/2009,"disagree, love the new pos effects."
3/18/2009,"don't misunderstand, i really like the new shield bubble in the sense of ""nice design"". it just gets in the way, hence why it would be a big improvement if we had the option to switch the visuals off.for instance a fallback to the old bubble visual, or heck, even a static fishbowl (which in many cases in 0.0 would be strangely appropriate as a choice).at the same time this would give a nice touch to folks with less powerfull machines, since the loading sequence of the pos shield bubble on exit warp can - as i understand from a bunch of alliance forums throughout eve - be quite taxing."
3/18/2009,"confirmed, please change before i have a seizure!"
3/18/2009,"indeed....so much of these graphical ""improvements"" this last patch, are eye candy that either induce more lag, are either too subtle or too obnoxious."

3/18/2009,totally agree with virtuozzo. please give us at least option to switch back to old pos / dictor / ect field visual effect.

3/18/2009,bump for something useful.
3/18/2009,how exactly is the requested feature different from this existing feature.or is it that you want bookmarks to be added to the overview so that you can warp to/align to them from there?
3/18/2009,"very briefly... let's take a look at a few issues, some of which have been addressed, some of which have not -a. amarr (need i say more?)b. black ops shipsc. countless weapon balance issues, both current and pastd. low sec intereste. drone region mineral problems (ie. trit shortage, etc)f. nighthawk powergrid shortagethe list goes on and on. some of these issues literally took years to address (that is not an exaggeration). some of these issues have been problematic for years and there is no foreseeable balancing in sight.granted, i understand that balancing takes time. i truly do. however, some of these issues are taking long enough to be addressed that they probably exceed the amount time some people are willing to wait to see them resolved. i suspect people have left this game for greener pastures after having waited for one of these significant issues to be resolved... and never seeing it.that strikes me as a serious problem. other games have addressed balance issues of this magnitude within months... while still providing new content.why is it that some of these issues are put off indefinately? why is this not only tolerated, but obviously seen by ccp as acceptable?this is a problem, and it needs to be fixed. sooner than soon (tm)."
3/18/2009,"i partially agree - it has been a long long time. i do see things from ccp's perspective though, having been party to their development systems and team structure on the csm though, and its now clear that even while we were presenting issues last year they were already gearing for the apocrypha schedule crunch. i guess what we really need now post apocrypha is some movement on the queued up issues. speaking personally this is the major reason i'm not running for csm again in term 3 - because i honestly want to see more of the issues i championed and presented entering the solid development cycle before asking people to re-elect me on the past record. of the things you list i'm keenly awaiting black ops improvement, lowsec interest and several balance issues - as well as a number of important combat dynamics and movement on 0.0 sovereignty. i'm pretty hopeful they will get there in the end but i do agree with you it would be nice to see more of this stuff receiving significant development time in the near future."
3/18/2009,no ermmmm and nowhats the point anyway u can still only use one character at 1 time per account fork out and get another account or 2 or 3 i know some peeps who have 7 accounts and run them all at once (hats off to them i think they may be octopusses lol)not supported
3/18/2009,"no.skill training is the limiting factor (what keeps you from being able to do things until you've ""earned"" the ""right"") in eve. levels and experience are the limiting factors in many other mmos (wow, guild wars, etc). none of these games let you log on to the same account twice so that you can level two (or three, etc) characters at the same time. eve does the same by restricting passive skill training to one character per account. it's not news in the mmo industry.you think wrong.tl;dr: other mmos do the same thing, but in a different way.edit: fail quote tag fixed."
3/18/2009,saggy glands.saggy glands.saggy glands.saggy glands. come on...seriously?
3/18/2009,big fat no. no other mmo does this. show me one (legit) mmo and then i'll allow this idea. --isaac
3/18/2009,i'll support it if they disallow char sales.i won't support it as is due to it's free isk for all chars.
3/18/2009,dont go there.it's bad enough people try to compromise a system that is unique to itself.this is the mmo... lets make sure it stays that way.
3/18/2009,"you claim that there are mmos that allow you to train multiple characters on the same account at the same time. so you must know of some. name them.apart from eve, all the mmos i know of only allow you to train a character when it is online. and since you can't have multiple characters on one account online at the same time, you can't train them at the same time. instead to train one, you must first log out (pausing its training) to train the other."
3/18/2009,i'd prefer to see a more fleshed-out analysis of the pros and cons before i support this. for now i'll have to decline.
3/18/2009,"woot !! i love it!, now i can train 2 research alts and sell them, at a time, oh wait ....and i can finally have that titan pilot i always wanted, and since i have 15 accounts that can all train characters at the same time, i can have 30 hulk pilots and 10 research and 3 titans and a freighter, + my orca and main,wait no this is a terrible idea,not signed."
3/18/2009,i'll make it easy for you.1: think about what would happen if you could train all 3 char's on one account without penalty.2: think about what the next guy will do.3: think about the worst bunch of guys will do.starting to sink in yet?good... because if you can't figure that out... you don't belong here.look i'll be the first to admit that would be cool. but it would be a total nightmare/deathmatch out there... easily abused/exploited.you people where given a damn skill queue... now you want the bloody galaxy... yeah... i get it.greed...does the body good eh?
3/18/2009,"the idea about being allowed to have alts at all or more then one account is already destroying a main and very importent aspect of the game, the same is charecter trading, shouldn't be allowed.it removes the unique identification which this whole game is build upon, reputation (it is the only thing that can be dmg for scamming and doing stuff that no other game would allow, and the alts etc are removing that one penalty.. and i find it very wierd that they are allowed to do so when the system is build like this"
3/18/2009,"what's the difference between that and now? you just need 3* the amount of accounts, only difference is that you pay more and can log them all in at the same time.. i see that as a bigger problem,which should be corrected"
3/18/2009,supported in general but would like to point out alliance level management roles and tools are non existent and that is most of the problem....you need to be in an alliance to claim sov... but instead of alliance being a seperate window laid out like the corp tools window it is stuffed in with the corp window like an after thought with no thought or care put into it....other posts have raised this issue and i believe the op's points should be included in them
3/18/2009,"denied ,now that it happened i want to be able to destroy the enemy alliances has they did to us,the mechanic is bad but i hope that i can make my revenge."
3/18/2009,not just the ships:p
3/18/2009,not supported don't waste development time on this. besides i like the way they look as i am sure some others do too.
3/18/2009,"hi, i'm decided minmatar pilot and i like look of my ducktape-style ships. i like when my enemy have to face those ugly-mean-looking ships.also keep in mind some ppl dont want eve to be candylook like wow. :)"
3/18/2009,"current mechanic is that you are physically unable to tow another person's wrecks.i would like to see it allowed.hopefully it would result in aggro from the person that owns the wreck.potentially it could involve concordination.however, it should definitely be allowed, physically, in the game."
3/18/2009,only if it allows aggro to be picked up when salvaged not just looted.otherwise... no.it's bad enough we get ninja salvager's invading other peoples missions.public areas i never have a problem with.they have it way to easy now.... so easy it hurts.
3/18/2009,"as long as they get aggro - yes. but not because it makes mission runner's lives unfair. the mechanic currently forces a salvager ""by trade"" to balance risk with reward. he can't tractor wrecks. that means he must fly to every wreck to salvage it, closer if he wants loot. that takes time, so he could get a faster ship. but faster ships tend to have less tank, and npc aggro is a *risk factor* in mission salvaging. (i.e. ""ninja salvaging"") bring a tanky ship to reduce risk from mission rats, and have fun with the time intervals instead.either way, a trade gets made, that is the neat thing about it imo."
3/18/2009,well if you get aggro when towwing... then... that's problem solved right?
3/18/2009,potentially. it's not really clear to me what effects this will have.
3/18/2009,no one said you had to tractor the wreck to salvage.
3/18/2009,"should course agro, just as if you had attacked the player you are towing"
3/18/2009,"so, i saw the new scan time, and i was suddenly thrilled that ccp decided to finally make combat probing match up with player reaction. much to my dismay, i find that combat probing is using the same gimped out mechanic that the new probing system is. with good skills, and 7 probes on grid, you simply cannot get a hit, the result being that it's pretty much annihilated one niche role in fleet battles; the combat prober who would provide snipe spots and warpins. it's now highly impractical to expect that, much less catch people at safespot. this is a vital element of several types of gameplay, and it's a shame that ccp really neglected the change it brought with the new expansion, and how it effected this play style."
3/18/2009,somehow i think your not doing that right.
3/18/2009,we've had no problems scanning people down since the change. you must be doing something wrong.
3/18/2009,"its not so much that you can't find people in safespots any more (you can) but that because the system requires you to spend a few minutes fiddling around positioning your probes you can't easily catch out people at short notice. before apocrypha you could jump your covops into a new system, drop a spook or fathom, and 30 seconds later you could be in warp to the hostile's location.now that you need to spend time dragging your probes around the system, scanning and rescanning different areas for hits, forming and reforming your triangulation patterns, narrowing down the target until you get a 100% hit, that is pretty much never going to happen. on a prepared battlefield where you have your probes out and positioned (eg at a pos coming out of reinforced) its great, but the new system makes it much harder to get warpins at short notice.thumbs up for the proposal of making the new system easier, but i'd prefer to tweak what we have now (for example, have a setting to make probes automatically move into predefined triangulation patterns rather than forcing us to manually drag them out every time) than revert to the old days."
3/18/2009,would be nice to put all your gear for your various fittings in a can and not have to drag them out every time you wanted to change fittings. i dont think this would be easy to code.. but if they could it might help a little with db lag as you would only get the call to move an item from one place to another when you actually fit/unfit items rather than also having calls when you moved your mods in and out of the cans to access them. got to say that this would be just as easy if players could have tabs in their personal hangers like the corp hangers.
3/18/2009,"over the past few days, there's been (as goons would say on caod) a lot of ""hurf blurf"" on this board about the fact that scanning in the way it's implemented now is fairly user-unfriendly (which mostly manifests itself in small w-space systems with a high number of signatures). so, i've taken the 30 seconds to think of what could be done, and, i think i've come up with a solution that a) doesn't penalize players that enter small systems with tons of signatures, and b) still retains the difficulty of scanning in w-space.the solution? make any site that you have scanned down and spawned (important) appear as 100% on any subsequent scans that overlap that site. make this a session-only feature - if you log off, or get dc'd, you still have your bookmarks, but now you have to scan the sites down again to get the same function. (same functionality as system beacons for spawned sites at the moment).make this a single client feature - if you scan down a site, only you get the benefit of the 100% scan. if your fleetmate was in the site, but hasn't scanned it, they have to scan it down before they get the same benefit.i think this should solve the problems, and also remove the need for people to have to get their panties in a twist about things like ""i don't want to scan gravimetric"", ""there's too many sites!"", and my favourite ""the sleeper turret ate my miner""comments/suggestions/flames?moved this from general to here"
3/18/2009,this would be a great addition imo! it is rather annoying atm when you can't really keep track of what you have already probed and found down in those small systems.
3/18/2009,"this feature is already implemented if you have a brain. bookmark the site if you have scanned it down adn spawned it. on the solar system map you will see a little ""pin"" bookmark icon at that spot. if a two-probe circle result overlaps on one of your pins, you know you've already found that one. deviation can throw you, but not enough to make it too confusing - what are the odds that another, unfound site has enough deviation to show up exact overlapping the other site, while your original site's result is deviating far enough away to not look like it?"
3/18/2009,"yeah, i know it is. however, from the point of view of the gameplay, it makes 0 sense why your ship's sensors can't tell a repeat signal that you have visited (and know it's parameters) from a new one. also, if you probe in w-space, often your probe will land in the middle of a couple of signatures... that will often have overlapping circles.i'm not saying that the way the current system is done is not workable - far from it. however, something like this will be incredibly helpful in sorting through the w-space and the many... many... many asteroid belts that come with it."
3/18/2009,sounds reasonable and helpfull.

3/18/2009,"i'd like to just see a separate filter for whs so that it didn't tkae forever to find your way out of wh space.as is, i would never go in there without a jump clone and i'd just pod myself out."
3/18/2009,"ok so lemme tell you a story. this is a srscat post.-new corp ceo comes to alliance. posts a mail giving epic details about a transportation op. epic stoopid newb.-alliance leader replies to alliance mail saying. yo you might want to delay that op and then keep it secret. ""that me and the alliance diplomat"" are spies and could try something. just purely joking.-this leads to 1 mail. spam, troll mail. another newb corp ceo says something along the lines. ""alliance mail is for being srscat, stop spamming crap.""-more people in response to that spam. maybe 2 more troll mails.-alliance leader who made the original joke mail then says. ""person x is raging. post moar""-which leads to outright spamming. this has happened many times before.-alliance leader aka person x. rages and kicks the corp.no warning. no anything. no 24hr cooldown. guys gatecamping suddenly appeared to be neutral to everyone. no standings.i propose there to be a 24hr cooldown to kick corps and can be cancelled at any time.inb4findnewalliance."
3/18/2009,"i got the chance to experiment a little yesterday. with my shader set to low, i could not see a heavy interdictor bubble at all. there was a very faint effect around the ship itself, but absolutely no ""edge"" to the bubble or indication that it was even a sphere. i set my shader to medium and there it was - a nice round bubble like i'd expect to see. so i'm thinking this must be a bug. either that or the plan is for people running in premium light mode to get killed at gate camps more often, and that doesn't seem likely."
3/18/2009,doublepost - i fail at clicking
3/18/2009,"dunno if it has been posted before, but this guy thinks eves online experience is not good for kids.to sum it up:- people in eve talk about sex and drugs all the time- ccp are perverts- sa has manager positions in ccp"
3/18/2009,"ok true, safer not safe. but still no support.--isaac"
3/18/2009,"why exactly? because you don't like being vulnerable in what's considered a ""harsh galaxy"" or because you think that being in empire its the game mechanics job to protect you from pvp no matter what?"
3/18/2009,"no... what is it with you? are you that dumb? the flaw is your idea. concord is not some independant mercenary group. they function as a united nations. they do not do what they do for money, they do it to preserve at least the semblance of peace in empire space.people are already vulnerable in high sec. if your idea was so great you'd be generating quite a bit more support. as opposed to you know, one alt, and another goon."
3/18/2009,now i know the un theoretically plays an impartial 3rd party to conflicts around the world but im afraid that just isnt the case. any institution that involves humans involves favoritism. research the un a bit and see why many people think it should be completely disbanded and perhaps you can try that one again.
3/18/2009,"yes, concord is supposed to be similar to the un. however, they have no favoritism, cannot be bribed or corrupted. they keep the peace as best they can. (read some eve chronicles...) so as ccp has already written it down that they are an impartial 3rd party, it is so. i've lived in all sectors of space btw. high-sec has some nice things, but i prefer the lower-security areas. i don't see why people should have to grind standings with concord to be protected. the sec-status system works fine in this area. your above -1 and they don't shoot. your below and they shoot. we don't need to change this. --isaac"
3/18/2009,show me someone without a price and i will show you someone who simply hasn't had their price met :)
3/18/2009,"no, actually, it isn't."
3/18/2009,arguing with a goon is like arguing with a ******.he's too prideful and stubborn to think straight and only cares about griefing... never mind the mechanics.your better off ignoring this thread and letting the goons and alts of goons make an ass of themselves.....again....and again...and again....and again <trails off>.
3/18/2009,"your right drake. dunno why i even bothered. /thread yup, /thread--isaac"
3/18/2009,"getting the thread back on topic, a person in highsec can simply drop corp, or stay in an npc corp and manufacture.imagine two manufacturing pos, one located in say, perimeter, one in hemin (curse). i, through whatever reason, forget to fuel my pos, and it goes offline. in the first case, i risk someone suicide ganking my pos for whatever i've left in there, though with sec hit, it's unlikely anyone can finish the job. in the second, i merely have no recourse, other than to defend it. arguing that wardecs are a means around it ignore the fact that it's not a question of the attacker, but the ancillary costs borne by the producers that currently hinders 0.0 manufacturing. by increasing the risk, or in lieu of that, increasing the cost of avoiding risk, it'll at least provide more incentive for 0.0 manufacturing."
3/18/2009,nice point... however... in 0.0... all you need is a good solid alliance/gang and your able to gather resources not normally available in high sec.incentive or not... all can be worked with to some degree or another.system works as intended in that context.
3/18/2009,"in your low sec pos you can react gases, react moon minerals, moon mine and have less fuel cost (no faction charters). so you have several important advantages for a serious disadvantage (unless you place it in 0.4 systems, where you have only the disadvantages, but then the problem is your brain not the pos).seem balanced."
3/18/2009,"you've illustrated the point. i have to pay for the defense, so much so that the defensive upkeep is well in excess of whatever benefits are accrued from being in a different security sector than the highsec pos. if my goal is simply industry, there's no economic incentive to remove production from highsec."
3/18/2009,that may be the case.... but you can't construct everything in high sec.you can't gain access to certain materials in high sec that would make your industry more lucrative.one way or another it is not a free ride by any means.high sec industry is not free.... its expensive... just not astronomically expensive.you people keep thinking in terms of relative stance... we little folk here have to start somewhere.if it was that easy i'd have a bloody pos in every bloody .5 system and then some...but i don't.so might want to put things into a rational perspective.not to mention you still need a corp... a corp that can be war-dec'ed... a corp that needs standings.... fuel...charters...etc...etc..etc...
3/18/2009,such as?
3/18/2009,well obviously capital ships for starters.other than the freighter's and orca's.and that's where the big bucks are in 0.0.if all your doing is small fries... fine then... but in low/sec and even 0.0 you have total freedom to manufacture whatever you want with the appropriate equipment.twist my words all you want... not everyone has resources you proclaim to have... even implied.
3/18/2009,hmm okey if they also instant kill anything with - standing and you got -3 standard for killing another ;)sooo i guess you wouldnt like that hu
3/18/2009,"supported for the purposes of csm discussion - though personally i would like to see the same rules throughout all of 1.0 to 0.1 space, with the concord repsonse time as a function of your age, standings with concord and the system's security level."

3/18/2009,organization is good
3/18/2009,"okey every one have tryid to put something on the market and 2 min later some one have althored the price on their order to 1 isk lower then your order, so you have to do the same, etc.i think every one can agree how annoying and frustrating this is.so i think we should make some kind of system that removes this.this is the only solution i can come up with, and this is how it will work:you set up a order: first it will ask you about start price, then ask about minimum price, then it will ask minimum amount to react on. then time it will be up for.so this is how it works:start price = the price it will start to show.minimum amount = the minimum amount in 1 bunch before the it will start to lower your price.minimum price= the price it will drop to as minimum before stopping.now here is how it works, when some one else sets a order up that meat the minimum amount and are under yours the two bunches will start to lower the prices 1 isk at a time untill one of them hits the minimum price and the other will be 1 isk lower.when a order have been set up it cannot be cancelled after 10minutes as a max after that it have to run out it's timer.it should ofcourse be a ""clik on"" so you could ask it to do so or not, although you should never be able to take down the order before times runs out.this needs some thought too be thought about some exploids in the system, like buyers setting up orders for one day and press down the price.although this would not be a problem by just adding in a ""minimum amount of day's before reacting""so what do you think about it? tell me about the wholes and cons you see here."
3/18/2009,first off: i suggest learning english spelling and grammar. (no i'm not the one to look to for that but its obvious your having trouble)secondly: if i understood you correctly... you don't like being market sniped.well sorry... that's tough... get a helmet.the market is so diverse and rapidly changing... it's not going to matter whether you sell or not.odd's are someone is going to buy your product anyway regardless.all over 1 isk? seriously... big fat woop there.i'm not that stingy.works as intended... don't turn the market into e-bay with auction sniping please.the only thing i can see here that's even close to rational is a time delay rule on price changes.but that is where it stops... no further than that.you place the sell order... you pay a fee to change the price or its locked for 24 hours or something.but don't get carried away.
3/18/2009,"sorry you gotta be more precise, where again is it that my gramma is off?and i am not whining just saying that it is annoying that you have to constantly modify your orders, when you could have a system that would automatically do this and it seems so rediculess that you can do this (looking from a rl market, you wouldn't change prices every 5 minutes, your suppliers would be ****ed if you did and so would your buyers).this would be a optional to click on or off, so it wouldn't hurt you if you don't like it don't click it on, do it manually, if you like it set it on.so if you got a rl and can't be on 24/7, set it on your problem is fixed.so where is the bad things in the suggestion? i don't see you pointing anything bad out? you just seem like you wanna whine about a system that would make it better for people not being there 24/7.it would be a positive thing for most people and only a negative for the few sitting 24/7 on ^^"
3/18/2009,i'm going to give you one more chance to read my post carefully... if you don't understand... prepare to be trolled.i made a very strong suggestion... and i already pointed out the obvious threat of messing with the balance... i'm not going to babysit everyone i see here... sorry.. not charitable right now.all your doing is encouraging a lazy man's approach to a market that is very easy to manipulate.if i where you... i would start learning to anticipate price drops... be a bit more aggressive competition wise... don't do 1 isk increments.. try 10 to 100 isk increments type.stop being lazy... think outside of the box.i can tell yah right now... very very few people don't give a damn about 1 isk differences on the market.all they care about is 2 things.1: where the hell it is.2: and is it going to bankrupt them.beyond that... most don't care about penny pinching... unless eve is populated by ocd pilots.additionally... set up your sell orders in systems that are not market hubs.pick mission hubs instead...free tip...i'll send you my bill...
3/18/2009,"i can see you totally missed my point.the whole point is people don't give two isk about that 1 isk or some of us even 1million isk or for some 100million isk etc.but the fact is that the lowest price is the one that is showed as the ""buy"" when you are not in the details which most people are not.which means the one with the lowest price even if it is 1 isk, will be the one bought.and here is the problem, people set it that 1 isk lower and it is very annoying that you have to do this.althernatively you could set it so you can't change the price less then 3-5% of the total isk amount, so at least you wouldn't see people doing the 1 isk thing.i did read your post and i don't see where you point out the problem with this system`? it would make it easier to set up market orders for every one and it would give a more rl feeling of the market."
3/18/2009,not designet to fit an mwd?? it is like hacs/bs were not designted to hurt enemies.
3/18/2009,"""the ship is not designed to fit micro warp drives"" = ""the ship is not designed to be used in pvp""."
3/18/2009,"well... as everybody noticed, after apocrypha and new exploration system you cant make width of your direct scan smaller. i loved my scanner narrow and not taking too much unnecessary space on screen. if we can resize overview, chat windows to be much more narrow, why cant we do it with direct scan?i guess it have something to do with new system scanner. in this case, cant you just make direct scanner to be alone window? that i can drag off system scanner/moon analysis and resize then like overview? just and idea how to resolve unresizable direct scan, but it would be much more usefull if user would be able to make everything smaller.how do you think? do you like resizable direct scan too?"
3/18/2009,"holy crap, eve has a hard-to-use aspect of its ui? supported."

3/18/2009,"if you bothered to read the devblog about the scanning system, you would read that ccp has every intention of working on the directional scanner. they just didn't have the time/resources to work on it before apoc. although i support this change, we don't need to bring it up.--isaac"
3/18/2009,"agree, minor change that helps clarity. its bad enough being so reliant on an external fitting program, needing evemon or similar for seeing our stats just adds more complexity for newer players."
3/18/2009,"very much like a mini corp hanger, allow players to rent extra tabs for their personal hangers. this would address the several things i have seen brought up here and in features and ideas. such as some of the container complaints and the recent thread about allowing us to autofit from containers. seems like this would be an easier fix for the most part."
3/18/2009,"the correct solution here is to make containers work properly - station containers ought to work this way, they just don't. i like your goal, just not your solution."

3/18/2009,<-- name.
3/18/2009,i would vote for you over a high sec salvager and an alt any day.
3/18/2009,"if you could include a little mickey mouse in the background(or best imitation), i would most likely switch over"
3/18/2009,amy?!?!!! nooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!
3/18/2009,this.
3/18/2009,what if he was a high sec salvager alt! thats got to be better than one or the other right?
3/18/2009,this.
3/18/2009,given that 'captain' pompous has not had a visible presence on these fair forums for some time i feel i may take upon myself the mantle of official csm delegate nominee for c&p.
3/18/2009,an interesting turn of events. this just came to my attention and it should make things very heated. i fear the results of this may be that neither you nor pompous get in but i do hope one of you does.whatever the final result i feel at pompous's return an official c&p debate is in order.i'd be happy to organise it at the appropriate time.i feel quite saddened to say tchells hopes seem to have withered away.it would make things that much better if we saw a return.i will still be backing pompous as despite what the fools think he is still a strong candidate and an excellent representitive of c&p values.
3/18/2009,"as is often the way with youngsters he went too fast, too early and climaxed too soon. after ****ing in his pants i doubt he'll have the stamina for another go any time soon."
3/18/2009,"i have published my manifesto, link is in this thread.please enjoy."
3/18/2009,"the first change that i think deserves to be made is that npc pirates should no longer give a boost to security status for killing them. their rewards are already more than sufficient, and why would your security go up if it can't go down in this region. this would also serve to have player pirates remain in low-security space to boost their status, giving the other players more and juicier targets.please tell me that's a troll? please tell me that entire site is a troll. edit: it's pretty apparent that high-security space doesn't need any advantages to be attractable to others, but some changes can still be made in this region to help it out. ank already did us the imminent service of making suicide ganking harder to do, but it doesn't have to stop there. one of the ideas i've already outlined under enhanced missions will help out - that of having aggro on anybody not in your fleet that enters your mission area. the ore distribution also gives people a way to mine for their own ships.a carebears wet dream that site is."
3/18/2009,please note that this guy is refering to the link above his post. not my manifesto
3/18/2009,confirming this.sorry for posting it in your thread lark i didn't forsee that posssible outcome.
3/18/2009,"i know. me not dumb, me can read. you definitely have my vote, lark."
3/18/2009,oh my god.
3/18/2009,lark take a look at my new thread please.
3/18/2009,"lark, will you put 'unban bai zongtong from the forums' as part of your agenda?ninjia edit: doesnt need to be all caps."
3/18/2009,i'm afraid i cannot accept that. while bai zongtong is an excellent troll and outstanding forum poster i feel these things must run their course. i myself have been in receipt of several bans from the forums.
3/18/2009,got my vote
3/18/2009,direct link to my 'blog' for the lazy.it also includes my sexy visage.
3/18/2009,how long is left on his ban?page 4 snypah.
3/18/2009,o wtf i missed the snipe....90day ban. 30day left :x
3/18/2009,ill vote 4 u if you abilitately maneuver to diplomatically but firmly convince the establishment at ccp to finally release the pir8 population from their pain and anguish by seeding smurgleblaster as part of your otherwise interestingly formulated and succintly presented lowsec boost agenda i would also like to congratulate you on the very cheerful and spiritually inspiring colorful signature that you have put forth in order to bring forward your csm candidature and wish you prosperity and long life in this fantastically exciting endeavour!!!
3/18/2009,well you're gaybut that's never held you back before so you have a shot
3/18/2009,"nothing wrong in my mind with being a salvager or an alt or both. it is unseemly when a player, regardless of their occupation(in-game), becomes a self-congratulatory poastaholic. additionally, despite non-consensual group activities on the part of the probably salvager (alt?) in question, i fail to see how that person and his/her/its group has any principled stand on anything other than their own best interests or from the point of view of a 'pirate' whatever that may be.srsly, if larkonis trassler has a passport, a modicum of ability to think critically and at least one limb (already assuming the latter is true) then i vote for him/her/it.to date, larkonis trassler has demonstrated vastly, nay, immeasurably more worthiness than other c&p candidates.btw, most excellent corp name lana torrin.edit:m.o.d.i.c.u.m ? really?"
3/18/2009,"nice manifesto, some good ideas :) can you add murder ******ed carebears?simply because of that bunyip dude been so frustrating"
3/18/2009,please visit your user settings to re-enable images.i laughed irl at this
3/18/2009,alt post poster posting about alts and posting?
3/18/2009,"one of my campaign team has been nice enough to set up a 'blog' thing for me. i have published my manifesto and my application is in the process of being submitted to ccp.please, any questions or comments in this thread."
3/18/2009,how effective do you feel your stand on gms can be?
3/18/2009,"i don't intend to make a 'stand' as it were. as i stated the gms do a fantastic job, however in light of a lot of recent events (chribba's high sec dread being moved for example) there does appear to be a lack of concrete guidelines regarding certain aspects of the game. in dialogue with some gms i have had to explain certain aspects of game mechanics to them. some language issues have also arrised, i have, on occassion, dealt with gms who have had less grasp of the english language than a grizzly bear leading to frustration for both parties i'm sure. i would like to see an expansion of tools for submitting petitions in addition to pushing for the csm to at least have an overview of how gms operate, and if possible give suggestions on how to improve the services offered.petition response times... this affects us all and is simply an issue of volume>resources. short of ccp hiring many more gms there will always be a backlog. in my experience most serious petitions that are well worded are dealt with in a timely manner."
3/18/2009,"what do you believe should be changed on falcons to make them more in-line with other ecm ships? on a similar note, what (if anything) is wrong with using eccm as a counter to falcons or other ecm ships?"
3/18/2009,"excellent question. in an ideal world i would like to see:falcon jam strength bonus dropped from 20% back to 15% or even 10%.scorpion jam bonus increased from 15% to 20%. this is a battleship class war vessel and should be the mainstay and powerhouse of any jamming fleet.introduce a new skill: sensor hardening (rank 2/3) 5-10% bonus to sensor strength per level. every other ewar type has a skill that will go some way to countering it (although additionally helping you out when not being affected by these ew systems be it extra cap, locking range, speed, tracking etc), why not ecm?ecm, though chance based, if successful will completely remove a ship from a fight. he can't operate any offensive modules on his enemies, or any defensive modules on his friends. if affecting a battleship he has to spend significant time relocking his enemies in order to kill them and his friends in order to remote rep them. to that end:ecm does not break a lock. you are still able to lock on to targets and maintain your lock on existing ones. if you want to inhibit someone's ability to lock then use damps. while under the influence of ecm you cannot operate any offensive or defensive modules, [lolrp]your main computer/sensor array is still able to lock on to a target but your individual module computer subsystems are unable to 'lock on' to the target [/lolrp] however drones are still able to be used unless they themselves are jammed, this means a ship is not completely impotent.i would also have the mechanic changed so if a ship loses lock on a target either through warping off, cloaking or exploding the ecm cycle is immeadiately canceled on the target (though the module still has to cycle on the aggressing ship). this will put an end to the frankly quite frustrating falcon tactic (which i have used myself on many occasions) of sitting at range, decloaking, getting off a jam cycle and recloaking before any offending ships can lock you up and deal with you (usually the oft quoted tach apoc).add a stacking penalty to ecm like other ewar. the first (or highest strength) jam hit's for full strength, second less, third even less and so on and so forth. falcon pilots in gang will need to coordinate better and solo pilots/small gangs will still have a chance to take something out should they run afoul of gangs who have packed lots of ecm at the expense of other ewar, much in the same way as they could do currently if they run into a hypothetical gang where instead of ecm they are packing lots of tds, damps or painters.eccm gives more bang for your buck than any other 'counter module'. it is also completely useless if you don't run into any ecm boats. however no other ewar is as utterly devastating to a ship as ecm.remove signal distortion amps from the game or alternatively give target painters, damps and tracking disruptors their own low slot boosting modules.currently ecm and in particular falcons are the defacto ewar/ship combo for small to medium gang warfare. when a gang of ten includes three falcons at the expense of any other type of ewar ship then something has gone wrong somewhere.fake editapologies for the wall of text."
3/18/2009,i may have misread her manifesto.....

3/18/2009,"i am not looking for a relationship in an internet game, i am looking for someone to share the same interests as me. which is jogging, aerobic, and eve. yes, i enjoy playing eve when i'm not at work, and i would like to meet a guy who likes it too."
3/18/2009,"haha, i laughed so hard just now. stop trolling me and go do something else, okay?"
3/18/2009,i will once you try diet coke and reduced sugar jam.
3/18/2009,i am going to ignore you from now on. idiot. how does a bounty of 200 million on your head sound? two hundred milion. if you don't stop your idiotic stalking i will post it.
3/18/2009,please refer to my sig~poor attempt to dig yourself out the self pwnage
3/18/2009,please do. although 200million could probably make a better start towards lypo.
3/18/2009,ignored
3/18/2009,"pwnage isn't even english. and i see no ""self pwnage"". i have always said i would like to meet some guy playing eve. the ones i meet at parties are shallow and full of themselves. yes, i want to meet a guy who shares my interests, and i don't want a guy who only sees my outer side."
3/18/2009,did you ignore my post of you quoting my post?try ignoring food once in a while.

3/18/2009,does ccp pay for the inflight meals and tickets to iceland? or is it up to the voted csm to get there on their own dime? i don't really know all the rules and perks of getting voted into office. (or where to find them)
3/18/2009,dear god not another tara threadnought at least they are funny i guess

3/18/2009,is tara wilde an alt of cat 0'ninetails?the timing and personal philosophy are curiously coincidental.
3/18/2009,well that didn't take long
3/18/2009,i refuse to believe any attractive women have ever played eve. of course... if you really are an attractive girl maybe we should webcam later. i don't look anything like tadesae though so don't get your hopes up. *kiss*
3/18/2009,apparently it's not okay to rage at people about how **** they are
3/18/2009,"awww... i think you misunderstood me. i was saying the the goggled image of ""tara wilde"" was quite ugly (and apparently a **** star, who knew!) but not you! i know your not the same person. you are pretty! *hugs*"
3/18/2009,did you guys know the average age of a person who plays eve is around 28 years old and at least 95% of the players are males? of course... i'm really a hot chick too! everyone give me your stuffs!the bit about looking for a boyfriend who plays eve is priceless.
3/18/2009,yay! i'm over average!!wait......
3/18/2009,the thread lives on~
3/18/2009,yup! its never gonna give you up and never gonna let you down.
3/18/2009,right4 pages of ****
3/18/2009,well i'm sorry but i'm leary of anyone playing eve who says they're an attractive 120 pound hottie looking for a boyfriend. maybe its just me.
3/18/2009,"no its everyone,its lolrly."
3/18/2009,so are you guys gonna vote for her?
3/18/2009,no
3/18/2009,shes already said shes not going to run.. i'm not going to vote for anyone now out of protest.
3/18/2009,"it's an age thing. called being grown-up, might even have something to do with non-discloser agreements"
3/18/2009,one hit/post ****** sighted...
3/18/2009,what are you talking about. i'm over the age of majority and i can sign a legally binding contract like the nda just fine.
3/18/2009,i think your z key is stuck... that or your high on meth.don't do drugs and fly ships! its a bad for your health.
3/18/2009,"currently, the csms do not represent the playerbase interests and concerns. they only represent the tiny minority who voted for them. or in the case of a large alliance that will not be named, elected by mandatory alliance voting in their favor.when the general playerbase raise a concern, it is often ignored. when they demand the csms bring it up to ccp, they're usually shot down with ""shut it, noob. you don't know what you're talking about. gtfo l2p"".and here's the point. the same issues that were around before the csms are still around now. other than repeating everything ccp says like a parrot, the csms do almost nothing. or to put it more accurately, they do almost nothing under the public eye.so you tell me then. why do you believe the csm program has any value? i see none.ingame polls are the only true method of determining urgent and/or important issues."
3/18/2009,"the first csm managed to accomplish a little bit, but i don't even think the second csm did anything other than go on a trip to iceland and repeat what ccp was saying about the ferrogel exploit. if you were actually going to represent the players, then why the hell haven't you all done anything? people post topics to the csm forums all the time, yet only a select few terrible ideas ever make it to a meeting. picking favorites on topics isn't the way to represent the players. if you actually want to do something that represents our opinions, then let us vote on what should be discussed at meetings. i approve of lavista's idea, since that is about as close as the average player can get to making their thoughts known to the csm and, in turn, ccp"
3/19/2009,don't forget 8/9 either.
3/19/2009,my 3d dlp wants a font larger than 1 pixel wide... ;-)
3/19/2009,yes please!
3/19/2009,i agree. i miss the old effect so much.

3/19/2009,"signed, old effect was awe inspiring, bring it back!at the least give the players an option to choose which effect thier screen displays."
3/19/2009,i have to agree we need atleast an option to choose.
3/19/2009,signed!
3/19/2009,should be looked at while the old effect just felt like a big ship breaching the space time fabric it now looks like... well... it... doesn't look like anything really.bring the thunder back!
3/19/2009,"i agree with this, the jump animations such, at first i thought they were cool but not any more. the old stargate jump and jumpdrive jump animations and sounds were the bomb. you really got the feeling that the gate/drive was really tearing a hold through space.and the zoom of the stargate as it sent or received a signal and the pow!! of the drive as the capital arrived. really was bad ass in my opinion.i don't mind if they give it a better looking graphic but definitely bring back the zing the whole affair brought to the table.-kaiden"
3/19/2009,"agreed. if not the old effect completely, then at least the loud bang and the blinding flash with some lingering aftereffects."
3/19/2009,/signed im all for it!!
3/19/2009,"edit: to limit confusion with in-station personal hangers, i'm renaming the idea to the public storage array.originally proposed by clansworth on 3/23/08 in this threadtl;dr purpose from other thread:1. a method is required to allow non corp entities to rent corporate facilities (factories/labs)2. a method is required to allow a more manageable method of per-member storage in a pos. (gsc's anchored outside the bubble is hardly 'manageable').public storage array (starbase structure)capacity: 1,400,000m<U+FFFD>rental units: 140 blocks of 10,000m<U+FFFD>when rented by a character, this array operates as a simple container. it will appear as 'my locker' when installing a personal s&i job at the pos to be used.when rented by a corporation, this array operates as a corp hanger, using the roles of the renting corp [hanger access x (other)]. it will appear as the hanger name when installing a corporate s&i job at the pos to be used.rental agreements are initiated as follows:- renter approaches array, right click, and chooses 'apply for personal storage' or 'apply for corporate storage'.- window is displayed allowing a quantity of blocks to be chosen, price (initial value filled in from array defaults set by owner), and a comment block.- notification is sent to owner starbase managers of the new application.- owner views application, and either approves, or counter offers.- once both parties agree on terms, the first weeks rent is collected, and a recurring bill is set up in accounts payable/recievable, and the array begins functioning for the renter.if an entity has more than one block rented in the same facility, it will display as a single hanger (with tabs if corporate) of the total available capacity.to prevent app spammage, the array can have a min standing requirement to even apply, if the owner so chooses. also, normal pos 'usable by' mechanics will still apply, thereby limiting to corp/alliance/everyone if so desired.options for item reconciliation:the concerns seem to mostly be over 'what happens to my stuff when the owner goes under'? i have a proposal for this, but others may come up with something better:each block is it's own self-contained secure container. so a hanger could theoretically be jettisoned, when it becomes a floating secure container, owned by the renter, and is bumped outside the bubble. this jettison can be triggered by either the owner, the renter, or by destruction of the array.along with this proposal, i would like an unlocking timer on secure storage added. currently, secure storage sticks around for 30 days of non-use, where it then disappears. i propose that, instead of simply disappearing, it instead unlocks at 30 days, items losing any ownership rights, and the unlocked container sticks around for another 30 days before disappearing. would not really be a huge increase in space junk with this change, as hangers after 30 days would most likely be emptied rather quickly. the jetisoned lockers are not reusable, items cannot be added to them (like loot cans) and once emptied, disappear.array destruction should also cause a percent chance of item destruction, just as normal ship cargo destruction. normal initiated jetison does not have this risk. (a nice way to cleanly evict someone, so an array could be unanchored/offlined)."
3/19/2009,"renting things in other people's pos's, no.id rather have it be a small hanger, similar to the corp hanger, but is owned by only one corp member who can set the rights on it.it would use alot less power and cpu compaired to the corp hanger.this would allow larger corps to have seperate hangers for people, rather than have them share corp hanger slots at the pos."

3/19/2009,"one of my goals and reasons to be on this csm is to improve player-csm communication, and since i couldn't get in touch with yarr and the evelopedia, all the csm related content is currently hosted on my private server. hopefully it can get moved in the future though.all content from csm 1 is now finally integrated and the issue part of the wiki is now complete and up to date. minutes are still in the process of being wikified.you can now review all old as well as ongoing csm issues, see what the csm is currently discussing, and nag the csm if your pet issue isn't on the discussion list for the next meeting. most of the old issues have a link to the minutes with ccps answers, and work is in progress to get the new minutes integrated as well.view the site hereit goes as follows.if a csm member wants to raise an issue, it goes into the open issues category, which means it will get discussed and voted on the next meeting. once it has passed the vote, it goes in issues in process, where it will remain until ccp dealt with it. if it fails the vote, it goes to rejected issues. resolved issues are the ones that ccp has answered.you can also view who raised what here.please see if your topic has been raised already before posting new threads. just do a search on keywords, or view all topics here."

3/19/2009,"then you e-warp out, difference is if you are pointed when you disconnect you don't dissapear. how about we give you a little flag you can set so if you are worried about a gpu overheating, pc crashing or your neighbour finaly securing his wifi connection and disconnecting you. every downtime ccp replaces all the ships and implants you lost while it was set. 100% effective, never lose a ship to a discon ever again."
3/19/2009,"then make is so if your shot at any time you recive the 15 min vanish timer.the problem here is that while you have a legitimate problem, entire fleets are logging off when they don't like the odds"
3/19/2009,"if you had looked at my idea, people who have that kind of problem wouldn't be affected, unless it happened within 5 minutes of login. as it stands now, if you get aggro, then disconnect, you're stuck for 15 minutes anyway.the fact is that it only protects exploiters and abusers of a bad game mechanic to leave it as it is. no viable justification has yet been offered. the ""some people have legit disconnects"" argument fails because of the rarity of the event, coupled with the fact that a legit disconnect already has the 30 second protection in that you vanish utterly unless you've been aggressed."
3/19/2009,oehw shiney
3/19/2009,yeah sure.it needs a lot of polishing. i just tried to give a basic idea.thanks mate.not a native speaker :)wasnt a devblog.it was one of the fanfest interviews if i'm not mistaken they mentioned that there was no sense in seeing a ship in hangar while in avatar form so it wont be implemented.
3/19/2009,i will support this. :)i would make a alt just to see this.
3/19/2009,"all i'm asking for is that they move the check for pre-reqs from when you add the skill, to when you go to train it. then some slight modification to make it also check the skills that are in the queue.maybe keep the pre-req check during the injecting step, but when it fails pop up with a warning saying something like:so where will all the extra programming come from ?"
3/19/2009,so this basically hurts who? the 0.0 people? i have to go 2 jumps from my home. using my t2 shuttle ofcoarse.0.0 guys have to carrier/jf skillbooks to them? or jumpclone to empire and get stuck there for 24+ hours. fun!or you could buy all the skills now. inject. go off to pew pew delve newbs. dont worry about such petty things.
3/19/2009,"definitely supported (and i've even proposed elsewhere). there is already a check when skill training is started that prereqs are met. i have seen it in action. if something happens and you lose the pre-reqs (podded without clone, or the prereqs change in a patch) you cannot continue/start training the skill. just remove this check from the inject skill command, and all will be fine. someone said there would be a bunch of bad effects to this, but i really can't see any."
3/19/2009,"would be very nice yes, i'm currently training for caldari ships and having to wait purchasing the cruiser and battleship is annoying (jumpcloning around too!). likewise i'd love to have all the hybrid specialization books injected as they're sometimes hard to find."

3/19/2009,/signedat least the option to select which one (old or new effect) your computer displays please (to make everyone happy). the visual interference with other effects and constant headache from seeing the darn thing for hours a day kills.
3/19/2009,"firstly it does actually cause a certain degree of nausea at least for me. it also makes normal operations significantly more difficult. onlining bars and labels, distances in posses are very difficult to read and it is in general distracting. distractions such as this are the last thing need when trying to concentrate on the task at hand for perhaps hours at a time. i can spend up to 5 hourse dealing with our 40 or more silos.the graphic is nice in principle, but needs toning down substancially. removal of the lightning/sparky matrix effect would be a help, and perhaps far more transparency on the swirlng effect. perhaps there are ways to salvage this which do not require major recoding. the old effect was calm, certainly, although somewhat simplistic as well. something in between is needed badly."
3/19/2009,ya i liked the pos shield before. i'm happy with the new effects. i have been sitting in a pos all day because i ran out of ammo while ratting up my sec status and then got booted out of alliance for drama crap.notify you cannot jump through the jump portal because the tower is set to consider you someone who should be attacked on sight.oh yaaay.ya did you see bubbles before. then now. huge improvement.so i dunno if i support or not.
3/19/2009,confirming this.
3/19/2009,they stand out way too much right now and it really doesn't fit with the rest of space.if they tuned down the transparency a lot (making them not stick out like a christmas tree) but still keep a subtle rippling effect it would still have the eye-candy but look so much better.supporting this.

3/19/2009,"thanks ankh, as much as i agree with unfinished content needing to be addressed as well my vote on this thread is more to do with the title than the specifics the op has mentioned, and while i agree each needs to be addressed i think there are many many more balance issues that are being ignored.in fairness to ccp i also concede that many parts of the game now are more balanced than ever, but why stop there? i would even be happy with just a statement from ccp detailing what they will address or consider in the near(tm) future - the silence is deafening - i mean, should i train a falcon alt now or what??"
3/19/2009,we also talked to ccp about their internal processes in regards to balancing things that were pre-nerfed like black-ops. i honestly don't know if they really took it seriously or not. but i think that they got the point.
3/19/2009,"i agreed with everything but the nighthawk 'problem'. i hate that ship, and personally i think it's powerful enough.still supporting the 95% of your post that was on the money."
3/19/2009,the difference is your paying for the privilege.honestly there's no purpose to an alt other than to cause trouble...if i had it my way you should be only allowed 1 personalty per account.would make things a little easier on everyone... and honesty would be valued.

3/19/2009,you're doing it wrong.
3/19/2009,what exactly are you trying to say here?is this code that belongs in coad?stop trying to be clever or whatever and just say what you want to say. unless you couldn't think of a reply but you simply had to put something.

3/19/2009,"sorry, no support. if you can't trust the people in a position of power, don't have them there. wow, genius. if a ceo of an alliance decides this alliance should no longer exist, guess what? he can do that. its life/eve. under current mechanics, its working fine.--isaac"
3/19/2009,"there should be npc-given medals for certain ingame accomplishments.accomplishments would include:* succesful completion of an epic mission arc* completing bonus objectives (killing the nidhoggur for example) in epic mission arcs* getting more than 9.995 standing with an npc corporation* being the top weekly killer in factional warfare* being the top weekly plexer in factional warfarejust to start things off.the alternative would be to make medals grantable to people that are not part of your corp (after which i would hand them out to anyone meeting the critera), but ccp said that that they aren't likely to do that due to people going to grief eachother (yeah really, pay 10 mil to grief somoene with a medal if you can just mail/message him, makes sense). so we're not likely to see that happen any time soon.so now the request is for npc granted medals. shouldn't be hard to implement as they already have the mechanics to award decorations to players built in the fw system.yes i understand that a lot of you consider this vanity, but believe it or not, there are actually people interested in collecting shiny items. a medal in the top of the items requested as reward for completing the epic mission arc for a reason. it's probably a carebear thingie though, but what's wrong with that?"
3/19/2009,"care is needed here - your list risks the medals becoming banal annoyances instead of actual trophies. equally problematic, you risk irritating people in non-medalled professions who would feel left out if you reward some things and not others. it also seems to be begging to be turned into a ccp specialty half-implemented feature that gets abandoned for the next five years. all that said, in principle this does have some merit. there are some real achievements that npcs would track and reward, and the game modeling that seems perfectly reasonable to me. i've got a lot of concerns, but in principle, i support this."
3/19/2009,"i disagree with the ways skills were reorganised, however these are fixed in a short time. and some things are more difficult with the new system, again time helps there. some of these things were hit and miss before and not much different now.but there are also great advantages to the new system, and certainly it is somewhat early to propose any drastic changes. i certainly need some time to adjust, and then perhaps will better see tweaks that are needed.it's different, primarily, and as such it means this tool will take time to learn to use effectively. indeed i have found completely different objectives in scanning."
3/19/2009,"no way, you have to have player skills to play this game. that's just stupid. ain't i right? wrong. sorry, but even the old scanning system was bad. the only reason you found people is because they were sitting in one place. --isaac"
3/19/2009,"i like the appearance of the new probe system, and the visualization of how it's used.i'd like to see the ui improved though - remember positions in the same manner as bookmarks, so that you can quickly revert to previous setups and so that you can quickly deploy probes in a system...if someone could come up with a bunch of suggestions for a reworking on the probing ui that would be really nice."
3/19/2009,"first off your doing something terribly wrong, scanning with 7 probes, so i suggest you read dev blog about the new scanning system if you haven't and else read it again slowly.second i don't agree with reverting back to the old scanning system. i'd like to see a change to the current.with normal core probes you can now find a cosmic anomaly in the first hit without the whole scanning process now of course cosmic signatures take a lot longer as you have to pin them down.what i suggest is make people easy to probe just like cosmic anomalies (with 1 probe) and making people in deadspace hard to find by still having to manually triangulate (with 4 probes)."

3/19/2009,"the only reason members get that cooldown period is because of roles, for whatever reason. the same doesn't apply for corps.if a corp were to become seriously opposed to the alliance it was a member of overnight, something that does happen. forcing a 24 hour cool down would give that corp open license to screw over that alliance for 24 hours. do you really want people that are ****ed with you, or that you're ****ed with sharing your standings?also, if that new corp ceo happened to be jason edwards' main then i would have done the same.please stop posting, or atleast give some consideration to both sides of what you do propose for once."
3/19/2009,"okay, but what does this limit do? you still have stupidity, it still causes drama, you just have the game displaying people who are ****ed at each other and not really allies as blue for 24 hours. what does that solve?"
3/19/2009,"no support. an alliance should be able to quickly remove a corp if it turns ""rogue"" and begins acting against the iterests of the alliance. imagine the damage a renegade corp could do during that 24hr period."

3/19/2009,"i think ccp went overboard with their new 'space warp' effect, putting it in everywhere they could think of. jump drive and warp bubble effects need to be changed, the first one for bling, the 2nd one for sheer practicality."
3/19/2009,"currently there are 2 different rules regarding this:joining a corp which is at war in order to take someone by surprise and kill them is an exploit.repeatedly jumping to a different corp (even with the same name) to avoid a war is allowed.joining and leaving an alliance in order to remove war decs is an exploit.now, these 3 things seem to be very similar. all 3 involve joining/leaving corps in order to enable/avoid wars with no delay or warning for the other side. i am interested as to exactly why ccp take such different stances on these 3 activities. these rules do not even follow a logical goal of risk/safety in highsec, since 1 and 3 are almost directly contradictory.i would like to hear peoples' opinions on this issue, and preferably get this issue raised in the next csm meeting. i don't mind which rules get changed, but i would like to see some consistency in either having corp-hopping in all forms declared allowable or an exploit."
3/19/2009,"wardecs are a pay-to-grief system according to ccp, so i wouldn't expect any changes to these policies until wardecs in general get a review of sorts."
3/19/2009,"one can be used to avoid wars on a massive scale the other two can't. don't really see the confusion herei mean thereotically you could get a massive amount of players to go to a new corp but they can just wardec that one the amount of effort involved versus one person removing the corp from the alliance and joining is massive. also changing people from corp to corp doesn't save any pos the corps may have put up, leaving an alliance does."

3/19/2009,"i'd like to see a graduated response:1.0: not in my doughnut shop! aggressor popped before the first volley lands.0.9 - 0.7: concord response time slows down.0.6: concord turns up to pop the aggressor, but usually to late to help the victim.0.5: faction navy takes over, responds with excessive force but the aggressor might be able to get away once in a while.0.4: navy responds quickly, but is about as dangerous as gate sentry guns.0.3 - 0.2: size and timeliness of navy response drops off quickly.0.1: navy frigate turns up after a few minutes, flees if anyone targets him.add random navy spawns in low sec. they'd warp around the gates and stations for a little while, attacking people if they had a bad enough security standing, but despawn if nothing caught their attention.remove insurance payouts for losses to concord or faction navy if the character is over a month old.overall this would make high sec slightly less safe and make low sec actually low sec instead of totally unsafe and unsecurable. the pirates would hate it of course, though i suspect they'd adapt. it might be enough to lure more people out of high sec though."

3/19/2009,sup mr vocal minority how are things today?
3/19/2009,how about we removed the npc goods and make the fuel pellets themselves the new npc good for the one all requirement primary non racial fuel cell needs.
3/19/2009,i think that's a reasonable suggestion. less shopping but you still have to go to the same place to do it. on top of that it should be easier to calculate for since it's a single item with a set rate of consumption per tower size.
3/19/2009,i guess that sounds pretty good
3/19/2009,"so what you're saying is, you don't like price competition? seriously though, your system doesn't work. at all. first off, you suggest 1 isk increments, which is ludicrous on things like tritanium. also, this is where i say something like ""so you're the guy who keeps making me type in the same old .99 every time i update my orders"", but that's neither here nor there. secondly, step back think about this for a second. how do you choose where to buy something from irl? well, there's price, product quality, there's side benefits(contests, free throw-ins, etc.), there's location, and there's the reputation of the seller. if you're in jita 4/4, looking to buy a dcu ii, most of those don't exist. there's no differences in product quality or location, there's no add-ins of any kind, and you don't know who is selling it. that leaves price, and only price, as determinants. even without the game mechanic of forcing people to buy from the best offer, there's no conceivable reason not to buy from the lowest and save yourself 0.01 isk. your system won't change that, instead it'll just take price competition out of your hands and put it into someone else's. i get that the 0.01 game is frustrating - i play it myself to some extent, and it really is a bit of a pain. but you can't really change it. not that ccp doesn't want to per se, but i don't think it's actually possible to improve upon the fundamental mechanics. i wish that it was, and that i could press a button and have all my orders fill for me whenever i wanted. but that's not a market, that's just a bad skinner box."
3/19/2009,"it still wont work the way you'd like it to.let me give you an example:you set up a sell order for something at 1000 isk, with minimal price of 900 isk.a minute after you did that comes a guy and sets up his order for the same thing, but sets it asstart price: 999.99minimum price: 899.99now what would happen:1 your order decreases by one and is now the lowest order2 his order decreases by one and is now the lowest...repeat above 2 steps 50 times and what you get:your order stops at 900, his order stops at 899.99, exactly where you started just not at the start price only at the minimum price, and you have caused a lot of automated database changes which no one would even notice, but it just strain the market hubs more.now the only difference is that you can't change your order for 10 minutes and neither can he.but you can get this without the automatic decreases of the price or you can just block any changes to market orders once they're set up, but then you'll get a lot of people crying.the only place where something like this would work is an almost dead market, where there are very few orders. but in a place like that you can do it manually anyway."
3/19/2009,"no what i wanted was that you couldn't change the market order at all before the time runs out (you set it up for 1month you gotta wait), this means you wouldn't have the constant changing of price and staying in the same area etc.and i can't see where the flaw in this is?you would get the minimum price any one is prepared to sell for and that's it.you wouldn't have to be hanging around 24/7 to althor it 1 isk every 5 minutes, and you couldn't change it after it was set up and you would have the possibillity to say no to this option so you wouldn't you it and could do everything manually as you are doing now if you prefere that.personally i see no reason that this is not in the game already, it is just stupid as hell that there isn't something like that."
3/19/2009,"how about you just research the market enough to learn a price that will sell. then you set your order to that price and let the others undercut you because you know that they will sell out, meaning that your order will then start selling.the 1 isk games are played the impatient. the people who set an order and leave it get more isk because of the higher price they sell for, and they don't have to spend time watching the market. the only thing that can screw them over is if the price has a drop that it more permanent than the usual isk games.with max skills, you can have up to 301 trade slots. either they will be using too many slots to play this game over, they enjoy the 0.01isk game, they have spare slots, or they need to train up some more skills.or are you trying to tell use that someone can monitor all 301 trade slots to play the 0.01 isk game while still playing the parts of eve that they enjoy ?yes, this is a slightly modified copy/paste response from here. but you would know that as you watch threads that you start. so why didn't you reply to me over there ?"
3/19/2009,learn to read kid.... learn to read.
3/19/2009,"not supportedreasons why:1:) adds complexity too market system and database call ups ie: lag so won't meet the need for speed initiative of ccp and most of eve.2). theres a skill that allows you to remote manage orders from any where in a region if you have it high enough i do believe.3). the whole point of eve is too play the game hence why we don't have automated mining, automated fighting, automated year long skill queues, etc....overall the idea sinks before it can fly theres alot more important changes needed out there for alliance management, exploits and pos's that are more worthy of the time required by ccp to code and implement them and more people that would benefit by it..in rl the stock exchange still requirespeople there to buy and sell it's not done by computers.... so why should eve's market be any different."

3/19/2009,"i hadn't put much thought into the csm till you came around- a (keyword:) serious canditate to represent the scoundrels. pompous is fun and all- but i'm glad c&p has a candidate who'll take the job seriously.couple questions:on falcons/ecm: i like the ideas you've expressed so far (stacking penalty, changing the strength bonus, etc.). would you consider nerfing ecm range? falcons should have similar range to other recon ships (40-70km, skill dependant), so that it becomes necessary to fit some sort of gtfo-mechanism, and you can't dedicate every med-slot to ecm. your thoughts?on gate camps: i don't think that the system is horribly unbalanced at the moment for gatecampers, but i'd like to see sentry guns only targeting ships, and not drones. this would allow every class of ship an equal opportunity to camp gates (you're talking to a die-hard dominix pilot, so i might be biased). curious to hear your opinion on this."
3/19/2009,"well for the falcon range idea, i think you need to keep the range just because gateguns have range of 150km from the gate, and if its 40-70km.... it is gonna pop, so it will be hard to use for pirating at all."
3/19/2009,"hi there, i don't know you as well as i'd like to, but here is one concern of mine im wondering if you'll cover,i'm mainly a solo and occasionally very small gang pvp'er, i am in low sec only (and been living there for months now) for heart pounding fights, loose or win doesn't matter as long as the fight is good. over the years pvp has gone more and more into blob warfare and ships that will ruin a solo/small gang day (ecm)(you gotta agree that engaging 1 vs 5 or more and getting a falcon (or sometimes even 5) decloaked on you is just booring), will you support and maybe try and get something done to encourage more small scale warfare? even if you wont support that, you'll most likely still have my vote, since anything for pvp'ers will most likely benefit me one way or another."
3/19/2009,"yes, and there are new and more colorful versions available if you wish to use them. although i prefer the alpha version myself."
3/19/2009,"eh, i'd vote lark. or tchell.i want some c&p in my failboat csm."
3/19/2009,is tchell even still alive? i've not seen a post from him/her/it in over a week.
3/19/2009,"tbh the only thing i don't agree with is your perception that the falcon is too powerful. they've overused, yes, most likely due to ease of piloting and quickish skill path (e.g. you can fly one semi-proficiently if you only have ship and ecm skills). they still get torn up like a piece of paper if something that's not jammed looks at them, and with the new scanning changes falcons that are sitting out post 150km are able to be killed even more easily.other then that your ideas seem good, and most importantly are reasonable."
3/19/2009,"i won't dispute that falcons are easily killed. they are not powerful on their own but they are the death knell for solo players and small gangs (2-4) players who are unable to dedicate ships for anti falcon work unless they bring their own anti falcon falcon in which case it boils down to who can jam who first.by nerfing the falcon, boosting the scorp and changing the jamming mechanics so that if you warp/cloak/explode players are left with a choice. do you want the durability/power of the scorp or the mobility/stealthyness of the falcon."
3/19/2009,larkonis trassler... official c&p delegate nominee there fixed my fix of your topic subject. captain pompous iz a lozer.
3/19/2009,lark for that csm thing!now where's my check....
3/19/2009,"you'll have my votes, lark.i agree with you regarding the response time of gms for petitions. some petitions naturally take longer to research and reach a conclusion on...this is an inescapable fact of life. i've submitted only a handful in the two years i've been playing. all were dealt with in a timely fashion (even if the outcome of some was not what i'd hoped!). your ideas on falcons are food for thought. your blog mentions not wanting to cripple them like a racehorse headed for the glue factory. i agree with this. what wins horse races often times is not one horse's superior abilities but rather skillful positioning and tactics by smart jockeys--even those mounted on the less capable horses. rather than nerfing the falcon itself, i think i'd prefer to see one or two countermeasures to that ship boosted. while perhaps more complicated to implement, that approach seems to offer more choices and flexibility for more pilots. but i'm no expert on these matters--when a hostile falcon uncloaks, i usually start looking for the outgate if i'm not pointed already.among the other topics in your manifesto, the ones i'm particularly looking forward to discussion on are low sec boosts to attract more people there, and expanding the war dec mechanic."
3/19/2009,"pomp is a clown, he has no manifesto and no direction. whilst it was funny for a while, the constant forum spamming with very little else got very tiring. pomp isn't this persons main character either, not a great start for a csm candidate.lark on the other hand has already published his views for all to see - clearly and precisely. he's put forward some good suggestions and is willing to listen and take into account additions and amendments.lark has my vote.^ this.to be a half decent ecm pilot takes a bit of doing, and it's not always easy, and they do get torn to bits quite frequently. before hitting anything with the nerf stick (well maybe a bit, like reducing the ship bonus slightly) lets give pilots their own way to counter using tactics and intelligence.there are ways to counter ecm now, quite successfully with the right tactics. lets give people the tools to do it, rather than handing it to them on a plate - imo anyway.i know the falcon is a hot potato, but lets not make it the sole focus as there are plenty more important things out there first."
3/19/2009,this fellow seems top-notch.
3/19/2009,"please be sure to include the rook in these plans. it (once was) a great ship, and deserves a niche."
3/19/2009,any reduction in the falcon's jamming strength will be a boost to the rook by default.

3/19/2009,"yes, via all means and mediums. i was drawn to eve after reading about the great ghsc heist in a pc magazine. i was most interested in a game where such dastardly acts were possible. eve mirrors real life more than most mmos and certainly allows one to observe and explore 'the human condition'.people complain about so called 'meta gaming', spying by means of ts and forums. however using these means as a corp is, in itself, 'meta gaming'. ccp provides tools for you to coordinate your corp via corp mail and eve voice. though these aren't the most efficient methods to do business, especially when running a large corp or alliance they are there and (slightly) more secure than out of game alternatives. even if out of game utilities were not used i am certain there would be complaints about 'eve voice spies' and 'corp mail' leaks.yes. while i do not have the time or patience for it myself and my personal code of ethics would prohibit me from taking part in such activity (though every man has his price), i do wholeheartedly support this. i believe it was a goon who stated'if you have more isk than braincells we'll equalize that.' eve is a game where you must have your wits about you at all times. if something is too good to be true then it probably is. most people learn this early on, either through their own actions or, for those lucky few, reading these fine pages and learning about them through the victims or confidence men themselves. those that don't learn these lessons early on... well... the bigger you are the harder you fall.unfortunately many of us are unable to live in eve 23/7 (or more recently 22.5/7, see i made a funny). insta wardecs, insta alliance join and leave to shed said wardec, insta kicking of corp members etc etc would be detrimental to the game and would probably open up a whole can of worms for real hardcore griefing of the non constructive variety.lemon. my diet has plenty of calcium in it from grinding the bones of my enemies to dust and making a hearty porridge from it. the vitamin c contained in lemons helps to ward off scurvy and keep my immune system in check so i can fight off anti pirates, carebears and aids."

3/19/2009,"i'm doing my learning skills now. pretty dull. i think i should log for a couple of weeks. it's pretty unrewarding. easy answers:-leave learning skills in, give them another property that would be of pew pew use to a new player. it doesn't have to be significant, but enough so that my immediate eve future isn't: ""wow. if i spend 30 days doing this, it will only take me 40 days to get into that ship i want""-kill learning skills. reimburse older players for their time by applying a training bonus good for the next x skill points, where x is equal to the number of skill points that said older player has tied up in learning skills. ***edit: i should qualify that. there's nothing totally wrong that i can see thus far, it's just kind of road blocky. i was having a good time leveling into new ships, learning how 1 skill going up by 1 level can drastically improve some aspect of my ship----now i have to take a big break from that fun to do this. i'm not whining. it just is kind of a buzz kill."
3/19/2009,"why csm and not direct democracy.ostensibly giving every account a vote is dangerous, because 1) the majority of players don't really have the knowledge and experience to make informed decisions 2) people with multiple accounts can have undue influence on issues pertaining to their own interests.for example in the real world, if you give people direct democracy, they will vote themselves more benefits and entitlements, because the poor always outnumber the rich, why steal from your neighbor when you can vote to redistribute his wealth.in eve if you have a poll : ""should highsec piracy be nerfed"" 100,000 carebears will vote yes, 1000 pirates will vote no.but if you refer that question to csm, even the most carebear, pacifist, non-aggressive csm player, will generally study the issue and say ""hmmm, i dunno, highsec shouldn't be %100 safe, let's nerf hisec piracy just a little bit but not too much.""the 100,000 carebears are happy that their rep stood up for them, the pirates are happy because the more bloodthirsty csm's voted not to nerf hisec piracy, ccp is happy because they didn't have to put in any manhours, and everyone goes home warm and fuzzy.newsweek writes an article about ""online space democracy"" or some such tripe, eve gets free publicity, more players, more hardware, more more more.that's pretty much the goal of the csm project imo."
3/19/2009,"i'm a n00b. this is my first post on the forums. just as an observation: i would have absolutely _no_ idea who or what the csm is and does if it weren't for the fact that i read the forums and occasionally read massively or something. i don't even think i've even heard of it's existence in game. maybe it gets referenced at the log on screen or something in that random babble of news that has nothing to do with me. now again, this may already exist, but i'm a n00b so i have no idea:why not have a localized csm rep or something? ya know---tell n00bs that if they need a little more personalized non-rookie chat help: ""see your regional csm alderman"" or something. give the guy a bank account so that he can help them out a bit and he can go ahead and encourage at least some political involvement. it obviously won't do jack for the older crop of players, but at least might guarantee that newer players are-at the very least - tangentially aware of csm's form/function. but i'm a n00b, so i could be totally mistaken."
3/19/2009,"i would like to see missile speed increased a little. mostly because missile boats are ineffective in sniper fleets. it should not take 20+ seconds for your missile to hit, that's just to long to be balanced with the current dps of turret based ships. max time to target should be 5-10 seconds max. at range turrets rarely miss, and get instant damage, why must missile users wait for their damage to be applied?also, please take a look at stealth bombers, they need some love."

3/20/2009,"none of those bonus changes really would make any difference. motherships have a role, they just aren't very good at it because of the poor implementation of clone vats.the role of the mothership is to act as a forward base of operations, allowing the fleet to resupply. it has a large sma and cha for this purpose. maybe the sma could stand to be a bit larger but as it stands, it can hold 4 replacement bs. the main problem is the clone vat bay can not effectively allow podded pilots to return to the field. this is because of 3 flaws:1) can not be used to hold medical clones2) the 24 hour jump clone timer3) can not jump from the vatfixing these issues and possibly doubling the sma size to 5 million m3 would allow motherships to fulfill their intended role and be useful. allow death clones to be set to the mothership, allow jump clones to jump from the mothership, and bypass the 24 hour timer ( set it, just don't check it when jumping to/from the ms )."
3/20/2009,arguing the status quo is fine because most serious discussion occurs on a non ccp-administrated forum is a pretty poor argument.ccp markets eve as a political game and clash of vast space empires. if it becomes impossible to follow the process of that game on the official forums then the time has come to clean up those forums and ensure they are fit for purpose. that is precisely what the proposal in this thread is designed to achieve and i hope that somebody on the csm will have the courage to bring the matter up before the council.

3/20/2009,"part of the problem is that ccp doesn't have anyone who is good at understanding game balance - as evident from their mega nerfs and patches. maybe tomb could do it tho, if they brought him back"
3/20/2009,i have been in eve awhile and i wonder if ccp has some hard and fast rule that they simply do not mess with balance issues till some time (a year?) has passed. there have been many instances where players identified an obvious problem and are even all in agreement that the problem needs to be addressed (albeit they may disagree on what the actual fix should entail). once upon a time it was amarr and went on for well over a year. black ops are another everyone is in agreement needs some love. despite all this ccp seems to simply refuse to move at anything other than a snail's pace on these things.partly i can understand that. it would be bad for ccp to be in a reactionary mode jumping at every little tweak players cry about. there is value in letting things play out a bit and see how it all settles before making a change. i also understand that they have a lot of things on their plate. new content is great and necessary to keep the game fresh and attract new players. all of that said though some of these issues seem to be on the back burner for far too long.
3/20/2009,"ccp has long emphasized adding new features over improving old ones, which is fine as far as it goes, but they push it way too far. so far as i'm concerned, the two most important things ccp could do to improve the game are a user-moddable ui and a complete overhaul of pos/sov mechanics, neither of which is a new feature. a bit further down the list are such things as assorted balance issues(most notably, lowsec), a complete remaking of the various game-support features(forums, mail, browser, etc.), a rejig of corporate/alliance role structures, cleaning up the default ui for things like science and corp management(as well as the game generally), bringing in a sensible bounty hunting system, rearranging mineral sources to make mining more useful vis-a-vis missioning, and of course, fixing teh lagz. none of those are new features. yes, new features are good, and often add a lot to the game - wormholes, for example, were a genuinely great addition to eve. yes, it's far easier to market the game on the basis of ""shiny new stuff!"" than it is on the basis of ""look, we don't suck any more!"". i understand that there are good reasons for doing it the way that they have in the past. that said, it's bad for the game. balance problems are created intentionally and then ignored for years - see bombs and black ops - and that just serves to sabotage the new content and ccp's reputation. a half-implemented feature is often worse than no feature, because it destroys the incentive to add it in properly, makes people dislike and distrust ccp, and doesn't actually add much of anything to the game. the whole approach here needs to change."
3/20/2009,"well the ""fact"" is i watched nighthawks wipe the floor with most ships during the alliance tournament, and they are becoming very popular because of their effectiveness in wormhole space.my opinion is that all the issues you listed are major and should recieve attention right away. the percieved failings of one command ship aren't quite up to par with ""low-sec interests"" in the grander scheme of things. just my two cents.however, again, i think this issue of response times is worth seeing the light of day, and i'm glad to bump it again. ;p"
3/20/2009,"totally agree, it is just not right that it takes them years to actually correct very importent balance problems.just to say a few, missiles/amarr.how long time can it take? i mean it is a whole race and a whole weapon system which needed fixing, why did this take years before addressed (and really it still have some major imbalances, rockets, amarr (still))so yer full support"
3/20/2009,"just a side note: tournament pvp is not representative of actual game pvp. tournament has specific rules and objectives that aren't enforced in actual game.for example, in one of the tournaments, stealth bomber gangs were completely dominating, yet in actual game they are terribly inefficient and hardly ever used.and i sure hope that ccp people are at least smart enough to understand that"

3/20/2009,"this is mainly for the pveers so pvpers you will have no interest in this and should skib it. ^^okey so here is why i think there is a need for more high end lp rewards.pve, in pve missions primary there isnt really many things for the mission runner himself too use, most of the stuff simply isnt worth for him to equip, so mission runners just buy too sell, i think it would be extremely nice to have some high end lp stuff that you could work towards getting with your lp.so i propose some new state issue mods, quite like we have now with navy, just with state instead (for those of you not familiar with the state issue ships, take a look at em they are a lot better than the navy issues).these mods should cost in the range of 500k-2.500k lp + some specific tags/certificates that you would get by completing some missions. they should be around as good as the second best officer mods of their kind but not the same (maybe higher req for cpu/p.grid.) and they should have full lvl 5 skill req too use, so a state issue cruise launcher would require cruise launcher+cruise specializes 5+ support missile skills all at lvl 5 (again a thing that would make sure that they would not take over the officer mods function).the req etc is just as a fast thought, i just want to see something i can you those lp on for myself (actually i wouldnt mind some kind of binding certificate thing for these modules if it was, to force people to earn them, themselves if it was.)personally i would love to have something to look forward to use my lp on :dwhat do you pveers think? (yes primary the pveers and the pvpers not really interested in the pvpers, since modules too 1-5bill a piece isnt something you would fit on a pvp ship in most cases).if this is something that could be of interest i will start to make a short list of how this could look in stats (or if some one good with numbers want too they are more then welcome ^^"
3/20/2009,"i think the loyalty point stores are kind of shabby, and there aren't much uses for a lot of the high end dogtags either, so you have a point.however i'd like to see some discussion first before i'd advocate it."
3/20/2009,"personally i see the problem just by looking at the navy stuff that is there, if you look at the stats compared to the normal t2 maxed skills, the increase in dps/tank etc is soo little that most mission runners will not be bothered with it and much rather just sell to buy some officer mods instead.it would be nice too see mission runners actually using some of the stuff they can get from the lp stores (and some very high end, hard too get items, that you could work towards as a pve'er that don't want to go into 0.0 to try to farm a faction spawn, although not to break the balance and make any alliance in 0.0 cry, make the items very high skill requirements, so there will still be a high demand for those officer if you are not a very dedicated mission runner /pver'er)."

3/20/2009,"i disagree, the previous system of probing someone in seconds was complete bs and was one of the reasons 0.0 (and lowsec) got emptied of smaller groups and solo players.the system before it when probing was some kind of arcane art and people left ships in space for months wasn't the greatest either. but probing should take at least a couple of minutes, a safespot should be reasonably safe, and i think this new system is a good compromise because it relies on player experience and skill rather then chance."

3/20/2009,"it takes far too long and is far to annoying ( false hits, can't identify target until you're on it ) to be practically useful. ships need to be treated more like anomalies are where you can easily get an accurate hit with just one probe, and identify what it is right away."

3/20/2009,"falcons/rooks don't have an alternate ewar method. i feel that nerfing their range in addition to what i've suggested would cripple them somewhat. unlike rapiers/pilgrims/arazus they can't really add anything extra to the gang by moving in from long range to close/medium range either in terms of additional dps (negligable at best from the caldari recons) or secondary ewar.while on several occassions while on the gate in a smaller ship i have found it useful to launch my drones as 'chaff' i would like to see sentries agress ships only, drones are expensive after all."
3/20/2009,"i share your pain. my suggested ecm changes are located here. you can't really encourage small scale combat without introducing instanced or size related (fw?) 'battlegrounds' which really go against the grain. it's human nature, most people will be out to win with minimal loss. if that means hotdropping a ratting drake with twelve carriers then so be it. there's very little you can do about the game mechanics, it's more of an 'issue' with player attitudes. i've blobbed and ganked and been unhappy when i've gone out solo and been blobbed and ganked. it's just a matter of finding people with a similar attitude (few and far between)."

3/20/2009,i would also vote for you - if you think you have the time
3/20/2009,i shall vote for you.
3/20/2009,why was this moved...?
3/20/2009,"there are currently 7 proposals for changes to the falcon (or the way it operates/the mechanics that affect it) in your earlier reply - that's quite a lot for one sitting. wouldn't it be better to implement some of those, with a view to others in the future? without some trial and error on some of the changes, we could indeed end up with a horribly gimped ship.small, balanced changes are the way forward unlike some of the knee jerk nerf-hammers that ccp have previously dropped on us in the past.as for the falcon gank-squad there's nothing that can be done about that because players will fly what they want to fly. as you said in a post earlier (or on another thread) you go out with the intention of maximum damage for minimum loss (example: hot dropping a drake with carriers - excessive but funny example ). sure ganking a mega with 5 falcons and a few frigs is a valid tactic, albeit slightly sucky - but it has the same result.most of the ""tactics"" employed by falcon pilots are for survivability - we all know it's tinfoil thin and falls apart when you scowl at it. too many tweaks at once could render it unsuitable for it's task.i'm not saying this is all bad stuff or lambasting - your proposals on the manifest are great, and i think these are area's which do need to be looked it and have been neglected. in comparison with other proposals raised though, the falcon does seem to come off worst and under the most scrutiny. you already have my vote - just playing devils advocate here"
3/20/2009,"i was just throwing some suggestions out there and i wasn't referring solely to the falcon but ecm boats in general and by no means can they all be considered 'nerfs' (i want to boost the scorp for example).as someone who spends a lot of time working solo or in small gangs (and flying a falcon myself when i can put up with the mind numbing boringness of it) i find it a constant source of frustration running across what looks like a 'good fight' and having a falcon or five decloak on me or my gang. as i said, it's human nature and people will try and win at all costs, but use of ecm boats on the current scale really burns my man nipples. i remember a time when damps were the ewar of choice for small/medium gangs with a skilled arazu pilot able to lock down 2 bs to sub 10k locking range and lollerific lock speed. damps recieved a real kick in the balls. i don't want to see the same happen to ecm, i still want to see falcons have a role in gangs but i don't want them to be the must have ship that they are now, much like arazus used to be."
3/20/2009,"nice, the c&p csm candidates are getting better. first pompous, who started off funny but became rather dull after hundreds of spam posts by him and his followers, then tchell, taking a much more professional approach and now larkonis who even has a campaign program.that manifesto looks good to me. if you add 'boost stealth bombers to finally get a role besides reprocessing' it will be perfect"

3/20/2009,does this mean mitnal has talked her in to running?!
3/20/2009,"i am honored. i guess ccp sees me as a worthwhile addition to the playerbase? i am not sure if i want to run, but seeing this thread moved to the official forum makes me consider it. althogh i will not run as a representative of the crime & punioshment section of the forums, i do have some ideas regarding eve which i would like to represent.if i do decide to run, i would raise the following issues:1. space cleaning: i see a lot of cans with 1 unit of gun ammunition or other assorted stuff with no value in local in front of stations like in amarr. i got recently killed because they bothered me so much i tried to take them and dispose them. so my guess is that these cans are intentionlly put in front so people can shoot takers. this i definitely want to change: stuff in cans has to be worth something before the game allows you to shoot the taker. i think 2 million isk or so would be good.2. mining: i mine a lot (this is how i make my money in eve), and one of the things bothering me, is that you have to mine into a cargo container, then pick up your mined ore with a ship which has a big cargo bay. this cargo can is vulnerable to stealing. i think a computer shuttle or transport service from a station would be good. you pay a certain amount of mined ore (maybe 3%) and a computer transporter comes regularly and picks it up for you. so you have no need to switch ships, and are not so vulnerable to thieves anymore.i have some more issues which i might raise if i do decide to run after all."

3/20/2009,"increase the slot limit up to 6. in an ideal world i would like to see the 'privateer' wardec nerf reversed. privateers was a blast and no real threat those it targeted if they kept their wits about them. i would like to see ccp and gms do more to tackle corp hopping but at the same time introduce a 'surrender' mechanic with terms dictated by the deccing corp. obviously measures would have to be put in place to prevent mass extortion by ransoming a corp then all hopping to a new one and 'redeccing', although heartily lolzworthy it would probably do more harm than good.i think it's all looking pretty good at the moment. the pirate faction ships (except sanshas), particularly frigs/cruisers could do with a bit of love, dramiel and daredevil spring immeadiately to mind. yes they're niche ships but that's no excuse for giving them rubbish turret/missile layouts and anaemic grid and cpu.more, better quality resources. give people things to fight over and they will come. mining in lowsec is currently economic and literal suicide. you can make more money mining veld in high sec than any lowsec ores and most people know this, hence you seldom see well organized mining ops in lowsec. the market is player driven and nothing can change that. however i'd like to see a nerf to generic t1 junk dropped from mission/belt rats and perhaps a nerf to the mid end minerals refined from drone alloys. a move of higher quality level four agents from high sec (and perhaps the more profitable missions) would be of benefit, not just in terms of increased rewards for those running them should they move to lowsec but it will increase player interaction. there are a couple of lowsec mission hubs where the residents make it very difficult for the solo/small gang pirate make it very hard to kill mission runners. if you give people a firm 'push' into the more dangerous parts of space, much like a loving bird matriarch pushing it's young out of the nest they will either spread their wings and fly, soaring to new heights or spastically flap their arms plumetting under the influence of the gravity of their situation to their doom. i find putting people out of their comfort zone forces them to adapt and find ways to excel, coming out of it better off than before. too many 'carebears' are risk averse either due to a bad experience as a noob or unwillingness to jump in the deep end.throwing a few additional r32 and r16 moons into lowsec would help out too.i do love fish, however recent health warnings regarding the levels of mercury in oily fish have forced me to cut back and i can't say no to a good bit of roast topside or a rare fillet steak."
3/20/2009,"larkonis, on the subject of a war-dec surrender clause i propose the following...surrender conditions are set by the war-deccing corp in a manner similar to a free-form contract (where they can ask for anything they want), and if the victim corp accepts and pays the fee then the war is over, and they are not allowed to re-dec for xyz number of days (it would be specificed in the terms of surrender).the way to avoid corp-hopping would be to have every character who is a member of the aggressor corporation unable to join a corporation or alliance which is at war with the victim corporation until the number of days specified in the surrender clause is up. to avoid them joining a corp and then that corp declaring war, a corp would not be able to declare war if it had a single member who was bound by terms of surrender not to attack the given corp.that would 100% stop griefing and i cannot think of any exploits but obviously i just thought of it so it is not ironclad."
3/20/2009,moved to jita park corner.
3/20/2009,"i would also agree that the dramiel and daredevil could use some love.. but mostly because i think they are beautifully designed ships, that really should have more real in-game use.as an additional boost to low-sec, and a way of actually using the high trit prices as an incentive, i would like to see a revisit of illicit mining crystals. make them work only for the cruder ores (high-sec ores, mostly), with diminishing returns as the ore quality increases. they are only usable in low/null-sec, but provide decent yield bonuses to low-end ores. this would do a few things. it would make it a bit easier to justify mining low-ends in 0.0, instead of compression/importing. it would provide an increase in trit to the market, stabilizing a bit, and actually lowering high-sec mining productivity. it would also bring low-sec income up a bit to be more in line with the risk."
3/20/2009,**** or ass?
3/20/2009,"larkonis,as far as i am aware, all of low-sec has similar security measures. gates and stations have the same amount of turrets, no matter if you're fighting in a 0.1 or 0.4 system. this make low-sec space bland in my opinion. do you agree that low-sec space should be more diversified security-wise?e.g. when aggressing on a 0.1 gate, you'd have to tank less turret dps than when aggressing on a 0.4 gate."
3/20/2009,i agree with this proposal.
3/20/2009,i am voting for thiz guy\/\/\/\/\/\/captain pompous
3/20/2009,"i would, but i'd get hit with the ban hammer.let my just say this. no."
3/20/2009,"yeah. antimatter doesn't make a whole lot of sense from our knowledge here on earth, especially given the complexity of producing it.however, maybe in the future, antimatter production becomes trivial?"
3/20/2009,i like learning skills please add more. i want (rank 8) learning skills.
3/20/2009,"this whole discussion is too funny. it's simple... l1 learning skills to level 4 and l3 learning skills to level 3 takes 5 days with the added skill training speed. it's not like you have to train anything in this game that you don't want to; if you want to mission or mine, train the skills first.it's not hazing, a test, etc... it's your option to train those skills when you choose to. i just started training the l3 learning skills to level 5 on a 50m sp character.i'll tell you flat out. if you are not patient enough to wait 5 days to train up learning skills to 4/3, then this probably isn't the game for you.oh, and by the way. the new attribute remap more than makes up for any skill point training deficiency that you might have as long as you train a select set of skill, ie just spaceship skills.i thought i was in the caod for a minute while reading this thread."
3/20/2009,"learning skills serve a purpose. not all have the patience/time to get advanced level 5's, while others do them - and in the long run have it pay off. it's an investment they do, just like some train certain skills to level 5 to get a minimal benefit over others that train level 4 skills.in that sense the learning skills makes perfect sense. you can compare that to why almost every combat pilot in the game has all ship/weapon/tank skills to 4, while some older/more hardcore has got all/most to level 5. the benefit of armor comps or t2 gunnery skills at lv5 vs a lv4 is minmal. still there's players doing it. just like some do adv learning 5's."
3/20/2009,the only reason some people have an issue with learning skills is that the majority of human beings have mutiple ocd's. i can't figure out why people lose sleep at night because something they do in a game isn't optimized to 100% efficiency. lets give + 5 implants for rewards on lvl 1 missions while we're at it. sheesh!
3/20/2009,"i believe the csm thing has its use, unfortunately, its use lies more in the ccp transparency than in player involvement in game development. it was, after all, mostly hatched as a way to garner trust from the player base after a few scandals. i believe in that, it works, as was evident with the recent pos moon mins fiasco. i don't think there would have been as thorough an investigation/report made public if the csm hadn't been in effect.that being said, i do think there will be quite the decline in csm candidates as time goes on, more because of rl issues than because of anything on ccp's part. i for one would love to be on the csm, but i'm pretty sure it wouldn't work for me in rl. i'm sure i'm not the only old-timer in this situation."
3/20/2009,"might it not be possible to launch the drones from the cargo hold in an abandoned state, then scoop them to your drone bay? after which you can then launch as normal. this has the effect of being limited by the jettison timer. you also run the risk of losing the drones to someone else who was faster."
3/20/2009,"i think your idea is best. i was thinking along the same lines.not overly punishing to the person doing it, but still involves some risk."
3/20/2009,i think we had a similar thread to this one 2 weeks ago but /signed anyways.
3/21/2009,yes

3/21/2009,"i respectfully disagree. they've sat in shields quite often as our capfleet cynoed in on top of them and blew up the pos they were hiding in, then cynoed on to the next system. surely they could tell the difference before and after the 10th.signed."

3/21/2009,yes
3/21/2009,this seems much more inline with the look and feel of eve than the pos system that we have now.
3/21/2009,c'mon do it already ccp :p
3/21/2009,resurrecting this dusty old topic for the next round of csms to accomplish nothing with... all the old arguments are still the same.
3/21/2009,"i think that would be of relatively limited risk. what does someone gain from obtaining a pos password in high-sec? no cap ships parked openly inside. if you were going to offer your services to the general public, it's a risk you would have to take. i still feel the prices you could get from especially lab slots would well be worth any slight isk you'd have of letting people in."
3/21/2009,yes please
3/21/2009,"edit: fixed closing bracket of quote.thank you for that wiki, been reading it the last hour. two humble concerns:a) some issues categorizied as ""rejected"" seem to have been rejected by ccp not by the csm, e.g. dynamic agent quality was turned down by ccp in session 1-2. or was this particular issue a resubmit and has thus been turned down by the csm for being turned down by ccp before? anyways, the categorization doesn't seem natural to anyone not very familiar to the mechanics of the csm and ccp-csm processes. first of all, the ordering on the wiki pageisnt the order of how things are done. ""rejected"" should be above ""in process"". having ""rejected"" beneath ""resolved"" implies ""rejected"" having been rejected by ccp.which brings me to: second, ""resolved"" should be sub-categorized into maybe ""taken into by ccp, high on priority-list/already worked on"", ""taken into by ccp, but put on back-log"", ""rejected by ccp"". these infos are ofc in the minutes, but having them on the front page/with the issue list would make accessing that info alot easier and thus could help reduce re- and re-re-submissions of issues.b) in light of this (easier information access), i would like to see the csm-votes on csm-""rejected"" issues shown as they are shown on the ""resolved"" issues. thus i could base my next vote not only on who brought an issue up to ccp but also on who prevented an issue (that i might care for or might dare) to be brought up. i could then check my own judgement of that issue against the judgement of my representatives and determine who is most/least in line with my train of thought. again this info is already in the csm-minutes but not as easily accessible. i realize that the wiki is work in progress, so take the above as humble proposals and keep up the good work! - ahro"
3/21/2009,+1fixing an entire class of obsolete weapons and ships should be priority.
3/21/2009,"cruise missiles are completly useless. if there is a lag in fleet fight they even need much more time to reach the target like 1 minute,even if you shoot the terciary target your missiles possibly wont reach the target in time.make them insta dmg weapons ccp --> less lag or dubble the dps/dmgor make sure missiles will hit targets maximum 10 sec after missile is firedalso if missile hit target from ahead,target speed should increase its dmg not decrease,if you run into a wall it will hurt you ,but the wall has 0 explo velocity :p"
3/21/2009,"sorry but even with those changes clone vat bays are little more than jokes. also why claim the their role is forward base when you can do the exact same thing with a few carriers and a rorqual for much, much less?"

3/21/2009,/signedmissiles need to be revisited.
3/21/2009,"no not really.missiles are fine as they are for all frig/cruiser/bs.but capitals needs a look at, haven't been in one myself but numbers speak for themself. a carrier/mothership/titan shouldn't be able to speedtank missiles thats just ridicolous and stupid <.<"
3/21/2009,"i watched a battleship speed tank cruise missiles on sisi when the qr changes were first implemented. that is just as ridiculous as the above, missiles should be hitting the targets they were designed to kill for full damage."
3/21/2009,stop the caldari hate. give missiles some love.while your at it give the stealth bombers a kiss
3/21/2009,i have been thinking about this myself. it would be a nice feature
3/21/2009,it needs a fix.
3/21/2009,"omfg yes... the first time i warped to my pos after the patch i was like... wtf is this soap bubble monstrosity?from the warp drive shimmer to the bubbles to the sheild-hardener effects... someone went totally ape shyte over the shimmer effect. on things like ships they look ace (though my ships sometimes end up 'cloaked' with only guns visable)... but on things as large as a bubble they're completely game breaking.i don't have any visually stimulated health issues, but after working in my pos for an hour i was distinctly seasik.did the box set ship with dramamine?"
3/21/2009,agreed. this is a pretty straightforward ui fix.
3/21/2009,as a refined english gent i find the lack of representation amongst my social class lacking in potential ambulistic exploits thus i propose:cigars: for the more boarish of mencigarettes: for those of lower social standingciggarette/cigarello holders: for refined ladiespipes: for those of us who appreciate classx up for participation.
3/21/2009,look for aproved buff large ac/arty from first csm meeting. is it done yet? nope.
3/21/2009,"i fully agree that apparently unfinished features in the game are annoying to the extent of being outright disappointing. balance issues are undisputed as well; even though, they are likely to be discussed more controvercially, as there will be one opinion against a nerf or boost; uproar and discussion garanteed.still, rework effort is piling up and, imho, jademako said well that the relative silence of ccp about addressing them is a risk to long-term fun (says a pilot who graduated five years ago...).now, csm representatives have shown more tolerance to the reasons of why issues are delayed at ccp - simply because they know more details. one may assume, hence, that ccp has valid economic reasons for their schedule. such reasons might not be pleasant for the existing player base. yet, a new major expansion surely is more pleasant to the market than a ""bug fix"" release.to conclude, the csm should be used by ccp to publish more insight into the schedule, and - of course - listen to the csm and prioritize some issues higher than they have been in the past."
3/21/2009,"i think psot #18 sums it up pretty nice. also, not fixing bugs does have price tag. i have seen players leave over unresolved bugs, unfinished expansions and bad public relations, i.e. devs failing to respond / missing insight on the development cycle. these quittings weren't omgemorage but slow, sad goodbyes. some are still following the dev blogs every once in while (so there is hope! ) and the general consensus in my peer group has been that ccp has gradually been changing for the better lately. there has been an amazing (that is, if your expactions have been shattered before) amount of bug fixes and things we were never expecting in the last expansion."
3/21/2009,"logical all ceos need to vote in order to disband alliance or any other major change, or lets say take in a new corp for example?the only reason anyone can be against this is because it's in some very inlogical way ""supporting bob""."
3/21/2009,"while ""pretty"" a lot of these new graphics are so lag ladden for lower to mid level machines. let get that post expansion optimization patch put out ccp, or go back to the far more functional graphics of old."
3/21/2009,"i would suggest not trying to run dual monitors with dual clients if you can't handle it. and you're right, this game isn't wow (although the fanbase whines like it.) which is why it isn't a cruddy looking cartoon game meant for the lowest of the low end machines. ram is dirt cheap nowadays, mid range graphics cards are dirt cheap. if you can afford 2 monitors and 2 clients, then upgrade."
3/21/2009,"previously i could only run 4-5 accounts on one machine, this new expansion makes me able to run almost a dozen so long as im not in a 700+ man fight. perhaps you should take a look at your machine or god forbid lower the graphics."
3/21/2009,allo i joined eve about a week ago and im loving it but im having severe issues with the market ive bout things on it several times and the money is taken from my wallet but the item is never delivered and the purchase never appears in my transactions.. most recently i bought an exequror for 3 mill where i had 2 million and when i lost my ship it gave me 1 mill for no insurence then my rl friend who got me hooked gave me 5 mill to buy a new one the total was 8 mill in my pocket i made the purchase i now have 5 mill and no ship... this is rather upsetting especially for a new player like myself who cant afford errors like this.im also having issues with the petition system i opened a petition 3 days ago and nobody has gottten ahold of me or mailed me with a solution and now ive opened a second one for this marklet error and im worried that i still wont get any resolution i mean 3 days is a long time to wait for an answer or a solution is there anything i can do?
3/21/2009,i started laughing when i got this far.allow me to give you this little tip.click on the button called assets.and please... don't start posting here until you've played more than a month.
3/21/2009,"petitions can take some time, especially now since a new expansion always has issues and the gms get swarmed with petitions. the more thorough and clear you are in your petition, the easier it will be for the guy looking at it to resolve. it also helps, if the petition is filed under the correct section. i'm saying this just because you posted this in a forum section, that it really doesn't belong in. chances are that your petition could be suffering because of the same problem.i would recommend going through your wallet and assets tabs thoroughly to make sure those items are truly missing. both have search function, but you're so new they should be easily found by just browsing. common mistake is buying items from remote locations and assuming they magically get delivered where you are. they should show up somewhere, if the money was taken from your wallet. if they are truly missing and not just delivered in a way you did not expect, you should not have issues getting reimbursed."
3/21/2009,"to preface this, i have some wrist problems and one reason i play eve so much (apart from the fact that i love the game) is that it isn't an intensively mousing game.however, after recently joining in pvp, i find myself needing to continuously pump the scan button every few seconds while in a fw plex, waiting to see if there's just one destroyer coming, or a full fleet including griffins. needing to manually pump the scan button every few seconds to be effective in pvp is just pointless. (imagine if you had to do the same for your overview).thus, i suggest that the directional scanner have an auto-scan option (using the given range and direction settings), possibly one that cycles every 2-3 seconds? at that rate, the scanner may actually cause less lag than a person manually pumping the button more frequently, and save many players wrists."
3/21/2009,supporting my own topic
3/21/2009,make that 10-20 seconds and it may be viable. the database lag from every single person who has their scanner open scanning every 2-3 seconds would kill the servers.
3/21/2009,"all rats belt/mission shouldnt drop loot, simple l4 doing per hour will do same mineral yeld as hulk do.i purpose:-remove all loot expect tags,faction,officer,deadspace gear-add named bpc drops from rats instead of named module drops-increse bounty from rats to compensate"
3/21/2009,"nowhere near. not only do you need to kill everything, but you need to come back and collect it all too (which takes just as much time). i also ask, why is shooting infinitely respawning 'roids floating in space any better or worse than shooting at infinitely respawning npc's that theoretically have had other people shoot those infinitely respawning roids for them to make their stuff?i do not want an increase in rat bounty, it will just lead to inflation.and a hulk will collect far more minerals, if that is what you are after, than loot drops. most of the cash from wrecks is in the salvage for missions runners, not loot (and reprocessable minerals).not supported."
3/21/2009,try ratting sansha in a station system. you will be astounded at the mineral value of the loot - i know i was.t1 basic loot should be removed from the drop tables.
3/21/2009,"im down for this, although i can imagine most will cry foul."
3/21/2009,anything to make l4' less profitable than good 0.0
3/21/2009,i'd agree to some kind of high end lp store boost but only if it is available from low sec corps only - corps that have no agents in high sec at all.one thing for certain - the high sec empire does not any additional rewards
3/21/2009,"i agree with this. i recently sold all my lps to a private capsuleer at 1k per lp, but i would've loved something to spend it on that was more worthwhile.however, this is an issue for the balance team to scrutinize carefully. if you could make some mods that mission runners would enjoy (such as the sisters of eve probe/recon launcher) but not pvpers, you might've hit on solid gold here. regardless, i agree with this issue."
3/21/2009,"well i have no problem with it being something any one can use, i just don't see what pvp'ers would use a 5 bill module on their ship (unless it is a super cap usable module, but only a very few of those).from the of it only to be able to get this from lowsec agents well no, this destroyes the whole perpose, since lowsec mission runners are not pve'ers it is primary pirates that want something to do while hanging out or pvp orienteted people that are okey with doing pve as a income.this was to make it so that the mission runners themselves could get something ""awesome"" that they could work towards.so that they can look at the store and say ""damn nice, if i can just get 2,500k lp and 15 of these mission sequence complete certificates and 100 of these tags, i can get myself a state navy raven"" (yer yer i know that they are not comming in ever because it is a collectable item, stupid in my oppinion to wasted designer time on something like that, but it was just a example for something that a mission runner would really want, and yes the mods will be very pricy, but mission runners (if pure pve'ers) have no problem with using those 5 billions on a mod they really want, and it doesn't feel as that much of a grind of they can buy it from the lp store and feel like they have worked towards it, instead of just grinding isk to buy something that some one else have found).edit:actually this would make the pve ""grinding"" much more encuraging since it would give it a direct purpose"
3/21/2009,supporting this on the condition it's changed to have lp offers completely looked over. only a handful of offers atm are worth it (faction frigs should be going for about 10-15 mil for example).
3/21/2009,"well it would more or less make a overhull of the lp stores (all lp prices and items would need to be adjusted, for what they find as a reasonable price for the ships is up too them. although i do agree with you that the prices for the ships are quite rediculess as they are now just a ex. a bs faction cost 350mill isk to buy, to pull it out of the lp store it will cost 1,2bill, so the lp prices are rediculess and needs a look too ( since lp goes for around 2mill per 1k))"
3/21/2009,"if your talking about making state-issue ships (the ones that exist right now) i'm putting my foot down. those should only be given out via-ccp. not another ship that is commonly used for rich people. as for having something nice, yeah, i kinda agree with this, but i don't think we need to add more ships to the game via-missioning. --isaac"
3/21/2009,"adding bigger rewards won't make them stop sucking. if you look at isk/lp ratios, it's all the big, flashy, obvious offers that are worthless these days - i really want to know who the idiots are that cash out in navy battleships, because they're getting next to nothing for their lp. going for bigger numbers won't stop people from farming them to worthlessness, it'll just mean fewer runs to jita to cash out. i'm not opposed to such offers being added, if there's a worthwhile reward for a plausible cost, but i'm not going to support it just because. as for your two somewhat interesting ideas, one(state gear) is faintly ridiculous, and the other (certs for mission completion) is somewhat worthwhile, but already largely implemented with items like zor's dna. not supported."
3/21/2009,maybe we can start with getting people like you out of an npc corp. then we can get you to work on getting player ceo's to give out medals acknowledging such achievments?
3/21/2009,no. eve =/= console game.
3/21/2009,"first of all, what the ****.secondly, what the ****.what you're proposing is just designed to make your epeen longer and serves no actual purpose (much like achievements for console games, which this seems to be based off (yes, i know, tf2, but you actually get stuff with those achievements)). why should npcs reward people for playing the game? what's next? getting a medal for passing x million skillpoints? if this is the kind of **** we can expect from you running for csm again, then i will certainly question the sanity of those who actually do vote for you."
3/21/2009,achievements are overdone as is.we don't want that in eve.
3/21/2009,sounds pretty cool.
3/21/2009,"on a side note, she's already served 2 terms and cannot run again afaik."
3/21/2009,"thank god...shows how much i care about the csm, though. i paid a bit of attention to the first one, but the second csm has been useless in every sense of the word."
3/21/2009,"eve doesn't need achievements. the novelty is more of an annoyance and something like the tok from warhammer would be crap for eve. it might be good for keeping achievement farmers for more profit and whatnot, but i doubt it highly (see warhammer's hemorrhaging of subs)."
3/21/2009,"i agree with your topic/idea.as stated before, warfare has counter measures for everything, and there should be some kind of counter measure against cloaking.i want to know when 'big brother' is watching me.i think the ones who don't want this acw must be afraid of equality."
3/21/2009,"they need another t2 destroyer hull: anti-covert warfare.it can only do it while cloaked, and it takes a long, long time (10 mins or so) of just... sitting there.after x-minutes you can pick up the ship with your directional (it's there, but not where). after another x-minutes you can get a range, and finally after the full scan has completed you get a range and direction. the ship appears on the acw ship's overview... but it's cloaked, it can't be targeted. the acw ship needs to either run over to the cloaker... or launch some ship-specific probe/missile/whatever that decloaks the target (ofc, using it causes the acw to decloak).the acw will also be able to probe for ships (including cloaked ships), but once it gets to where they think the cloaker is they have to run through the 'sit and watch' routine."
3/21/2009,"yes, because clearly this wouldn't be yet another nail in the coffin of stealth bombers/gallente recons.essentially you want to add an i-win ship that allows you to completely counter 6 different classes of ships (and more if you include ships which can fit a proto-cloak [all of them]). every gang in eve would need one of these ships to be competitive, and as such covops ships would become completely useless except for the possible exception of falcons (ecm) and covops (probing).also, by 'fun and interesting' i assume you mean 'click button - wait 30 seconds - warp your whole gang on top of that lone recon'."
3/21/2009,"yes, after getting endlessly blown up in my newbie days, it needs a change."
3/21/2009,"if a newb is too hasty and refuses to read the ""criminal act"" pop up, they deserve to die."

3/21/2009,i support this candidate!chip m for csm!ak
3/21/2009,what is your solution to this that doesnt involve some sort of instancing? i am very very much opposed to any form of instances in game.
3/21/2009,"when i first ran for the csm i had a certain segment in mind that i hoped to represent. this is the peaceful industrial or pve player that often times are dismissed as a ""care bear"". many of the more vocal posters on the eve forums would have you believe that these players have no place in the 'verse and are not a part of eve ccp ever intended to create.i think a large number of us know that simply isn't true. there are those of us that choose to live our lives in space believing that eve does not have to be zero sum game. that we deserve to enjoy the experience on our terms and not those dictated by a vocal minority that believe eve can only be chaos and not harmony. these are the pilots of eve who's views i have attempted to represent.please note i do not advocate forcing my preferred experience on the rest of the 'verse. my record has shown i have never advocated that the fundamental elements of risk verses reward the exist today be changed. i believe ccp understands this balance and my direct interactions with the ccp reinforced my confidence that they know the value of we ""care bears"". that said i think it is key that the voice of the ""bears"" continue to be represented in the csm.so to that end for this election i would like to call for the creation of a formal political party that can become the holders of this torch. i ask that any pilots that support these basic ideals show your support in this thread and that you offer possible ""planks"" for the core party values. if you are a candidate and this idea resonates with you please indicate your interest in joining this party and gaining its endorsement.so let us all join together and find our voice,issler dainzefounder of the ""voice of reason"" party(note: the first thing we could all do is find a better name!)"
3/21/2009,"i agree with the point you're making, but i think that you're overstating it pretty severely. yes, there are people who mock the carebears and consider them beneath eve's dignity. we call these people ""idiots"", and there's not really that many of them. there's a lot more who want to fly with lean pvp-centric corps and want people putting their sp into shooting things, but most of that crowd i've talked to have plenty of respect for the industrialists, they just don't want them dropping their combat efficiency. a pirate's ship comes from jita in the same way a person's food comes from the supermarket, and they know that. i guess i'm just not sure what your party is really pushing for here. industry-centric improvements don't really need any attempt to form a broad-based movement, and the electoral structure of the csm doesn't allow for a conventional party to work as a tool for getting its members elected - in fact, it'll likely make it harder to get your people elected if you try to put too many on. creating a manifesto as a litmus test for candidate support might make sense, but i'm not really sure what statements it might contain that would really be useful in telling industrialists who to support and who not to. it's not like ""the people who make all the ships in the game are important to the continued functioning of the game economy"" is really a controversial statement, and there's no real hot-button issues affecting industry right now. i understand where you're coming from, but i'm not really sure what this will ultimately accomplish, aside from getting a list of people willing to sign their names to a statement that ultimately amounts to saying ""i am generically in favour of industry"". if you have any good ideas here, i'd love to see them - i'm interested in what sort of structure we can get on csm voting, and how candidates can better reach voters and help them understand the vast number of positions taken. but without a concrete direction for this, i'm not sure you'll achieve that."
3/21/2009,"i think what i'm saying is that there needs to be a voice in the csm for a particular groups of players often derided as being carebears. i am trying to form some political ""center of gravity"" around that group of pilots in eve so that their voice is clearly part of the csm process.that's pretty much it, but this post was about getting some feedback about what a party based on this player base would call it's basic tennents.for example some things i would say would be relevant:1. improving the risk/reward realities of eve. an example of current problems would be low sec.2. making sure that eve feature roadmaps include mining, industry and pve.3. making sure that the economy continues to be healthy and balanced.4. that the csm keeps ccp honest and particiates in oversight.5. that casual play continues to be an option.those are some things that come to mind when i think about it but i am asking others for ideas as to what matters to the players in this segment.issler"
3/21/2009,"crap. i click on an issler thread, expecting it to be about her nonni's policies.i'm disappointed"
3/21/2009,i hope the party will embrace nonni's and the range of deserts including pie necessary for an optimal eve experience.issler
3/21/2009,"a carebear party?one would think average iq's are high enough that one wouldn't be needed.where do pirates think ships come from, the stork?you know i just came to a sad realization. missions are almost the only fun thing to do in eve besides pvp. and by fun i don't mean ""take your clothes off"" fun i mean ""i was able to click the mouse around for a bit and avoid falling asleep"" fun.since you need pve to grind cash for pvp, i'd say pve needs a major boost of fun.or better yet find a way to turn pvp into a profession, so one isn't forced to do pve at all. maybe a bounty on all player ships or something. or maybe make faction warfare pay a salary. some kind of ""veterans pension.""i don't know. all i know is that if there were some way to do pvp %100 of the time, eve would be a better game.and yes, there's absolutely nothing wrong with not participating in pvp if it doesn't ""float your boat."" if you want to be a %100 miner full time, far be it from me to criticise you.the eve theme is freedom."
3/21/2009,"i suppose you never heard of the take care party that i set up in response to the csm, when there was a call for a voice that would represent the silent majority.erik finnegan is the new representative of the individualists, small corporations, and industrial stuff on behalf of the take care party and will continue what i have started back in 2008. it's not like take care will die when i can no longer run for csm, it's a long term project that i'm glad to have started and glad to hand over to it's next protagonist.anyway, good luck to you too, two is better than one."
3/21/2009,arent politicians bad people? i think someone said that :danyway gl both issler and ankh
3/21/2009,"i read this thread while watching an episode of south park, and quite frankly it could have been a script for the next episode."
3/21/2009,i have major issues with people who entertain stupid arguments (like the one sitting over there where your fellow posters are griping about goons attacking your alliance)especially ones that come up with crackpot ideas like this.no thanks... i'll pass.
3/21/2009,since you aren't who this party intends to represent your absence would have been expected.issler
3/21/2009,"i would personally propose the creation of a liberal party, dedicated to keeping eve as much of a free-for-all sandbox as humanly possible. wouldn't a carebear party be naturally conservative?"
3/21/2009,"i'd like to propose a new ai addition to the game. the option is to add rats who can drop bubbles and force players into combat.these rats would target quicker and could station bubble ""traps"" that they respond to at gates. they couls either be present, or else the bubble could act as a trigger for them, as they idled far off and respawned at that location after a time frame.this could also tie in to the presence of certain complexes.having these in lowsec could attract new players seeking a new and exciting challenge."
3/21/2009,"bubbles don't work in lowsec, silly."
3/21/2009,"antimatter should have the longest range as its energy potential doesn't decay, unlike plasma. then again with the negative polarity railguns would have to invert their polarity as well and thus propel the thing at slower velocities, making them less accurate at long range?unless it really is an underwater simulator."
3/21/2009,"tl;dr all of that **** but issler is yet another terrible csm on this term's council (see, ankehasudsja & bunyip)"
3/21/2009,"oh noes! i have failed the nexus kinnon test!makes me want to run again to try and win him over. so nexus, take a moment out of your busy life and explain what you think the csm does and what would make a good one?can you site something specific i have done for example to be so poor at it?issler"

3/22/2009,"oh god, csm please bring this up the lack of animation is really disappointing."
3/22/2009,bring back the old jump effect this one is very boring
3/22/2009,"posting cause i was told to and i<U+FFFD>m wasted ....but yeah, hooray for the old cyno effect"
3/22/2009,"i concur, the old effect was amazing, the new one is meh.third edit, hi enjoi."
3/22/2009,change it back
3/22/2009,old cyno animation
3/22/2009,do it nao
3/22/2009,stronger and more intimidating
3/22/2009,the new cyno just looks like you've diappeared. the old one actually looked like you were going some where (in a really cool way)why should cap pilots have the same jump effects as everyone else??
3/22/2009,play nice joi joi :) ill gladly take any smack from the goons in return for there support in getting this through :d. its good to see the support in this and im hoping some csms and ccp will start looking at this.
3/22/2009,agreeing with da op.

3/22/2009,we need this
3/22/2009,ya current pos look like crap even with the new bubble. pos should look like a weaker version of outposts really not some massive force field in space.really i mean it goes against the idea of space ships because if it was possible to have that massive of a force field i would strap it to a titan.so ccp get working on making this work soon./signed
3/22/2009,"can only support it. fury missiles got a little use in some cases, but for majority t2 is inferior. [although i did support it already]to the ones saying faction is ""for free"":no it is not, 1. lp, can be invested elsewhere for isk. 2. they cost money, too 2.4m for 5000 hybrid l for example. 3. minerals for t1 ammo isn't free either. they cost exactly the amount of is you'd get for the minerals on the market if you sold those + slot cost 8only a few thousand though]"

3/22/2009,"signed, missiles are indeed quite useless in most cases.they need a totally overhull to work in both pvp and pve"
3/22/2009,"if you are going to use a extra person as support, just put some one with a couple of remote tracking computers and the turrets will once again outpreform missiles no prob. (besides you need a webber ship more then target painter to get your full dmg now)"
3/22/2009,"i see no downside. the security risks would be identical to the existing hangar system, and would be managed the same way. if a given alliance felt the risks were too high, they would not have to use it!"
3/22/2009,fix ittt !!!
3/22/2009,arg would be a horribly way to lose a capital.

3/22/2009,fix it!!!
3/22/2009,i agree that ships should be to scale with other ships. with the new physics that smaller ships have harder times bumping larger ones no one is going to care thier carrier/mom is a bigger bumping target./signed
3/22/2009,don't forget to check the support box
3/22/2009,"first of all, the skill que is awesome...but...example...i have a specialized miner alt, meaning mining is all he is going to do, so i don't really have a whole lot of ""other"" skills that are usefull to him to fill up the training que with. now he is going to finish astrogeology v (the pre-req for exhumers i) at 2am on a weeknight. however, i can't inject exhumers and stick it in the que because he doesn't meet the pre-reqs yet.so as it currently stands, i will have to essentially waste 16 hours of possilbe training time (2am to 6pm), which is 47% of the time that it will take that character to train to exhumers lvl 3 (for the hulk). now 16 hours is nothing to qq about, and in the end it's really not that big of a deal, but in a game where training time is a major major part of how it's played, 16 hours is a big deal. some of you might say, ""sign on in the morning and switch to exhumers then,"" but then i'm still wasting 7 hours of training time. some of you might say ""que up a bunch of other skills then,"" but like i said, i don't have a bunch of other skills to stick in the que because all he's going to do is mine, he won't even be refining, so they would be just as much a waste of time as not training.i'm in full support of this.as for what drake said:no, it doesn't add to the ""lazy man"" effect, in fact it takes away from the ""this is a pain in the ass"" effect, which is what the skill que was designed and supposed to do in the first place. i'm all for keeping the game somewhat difficult and complex so that you actually have to put forth an effort, and also use your brain, to play instead of vegetating in front of your computer screen...but the skill que had one major goal, and that was to keep people from having to sign on dozens of times during the day, or in the middle of the night, just to change a skill.now i would never get up at 2am just to change a skill in a game; sleep is way more important to me. however, as it currently works, the skill que (in some situations) would still require players to do what it was designed to prevent us from having to do in the first place. again, i would never make a big fuss about 7 or even 16 hours of training time as i do have a life, and this is a game. however, from a functional standpoint, the addition of a skill que feature did not fully address the issues for which it was developed.here's the way it should work:1. if you have all the pre-reqs trained, then you can inject/train a skill.2. if you either have all pre-reqs trained, or in the skill que, then you can inject.3. if you have a pre-req/s qued up, and you inject a skill, your training should be locked and the que should be frozen, so that you cannot pause training, or take anything out of the que before the pre-req/s finish.yes, it would take some extra programming, but if ccp wants this feature to do what they said that it was supposed to do, this needs to be ""fixed.""p.s.ever since my first day in new eden i thought it made much more sence to take out the physical skillbooks. paying for them makes sence, but the necessity of flying to a station to get the physical book, never made any sence to me. i mean if we can implant microchips into our brains i don't understand why we're still reading paperback books. i would suggest that they integrate training into the shops as part of the walking in stations expansion. i.e. in order to purchase/inject new skills, you have to stop by a shop inside a station to get it; that would also make the shops a little more meaningful. or maybe do it for certain higher ranked (>8) skills only."
3/22/2009,"personally, i like the new graphic however, i can definately see where it can be an issue to some working at their pos.perhaps an alternative would be a client-side checkbox in the [esc] menu to ""disable new pos shield effects""so, kind of half-support"
3/22/2009,"only needing the mouse to select one thing, and then spamming the keystroke, is better than needing the mouse to select one thing and then go to the warp-to button above the overview. the fact that you have to click on your target doesn't make the function keys worthless as a means to activate modules. but i see your point.perhaps this could be paired with an ability to designate a default location in a particular system that you would warp to with this command? i'm fine with that idea, but i expect push-back from pirates who think that would make it too easy for a victim to escape."

3/22/2009,"1. yep.2. nope. or at least make it optional. i like how standings are internal - you could set somebody red and tell them they are blue and they will never know (until they get attacked that is).3. yep.4. just make it possible to set the motd in corp and alliance chat with proper roles (and put fleet invites there).5. no. corps have to do the same thing for offices, you have a month to pay it. if you pay your bills when you get them, even if you're away for a week you should be fine.6. yep. just a system similar to corp voting would be nice, but let the exec corp choose how to allocate votes (equally, arbitrarily, by seniority, or by membercount).7. no. the market is mostly anonymous to prevent this. keep it that way. you are free to use contracts, trading, or shared hangars to do this.8. yes, and the same thing in corp mail.9. make it possible for alliances to rent offices.good ideas!"

3/22/2009,"if you want to transfer a character, you need a credit card with  20 on it. but what if you dont have money atm but you have a 30day plex in hangar of character you want to move. plex in game are tax free (i mean real tax free because banks are not involved in operation on existing virtual items already in game) so it will be enought as a payment. and a new option under right mouse button menu on plex, something like ""convert into transfer fee"" in addition to slight modification of eve account management page: - transfer character using credit card (old one)- transfer character using converted plex (new)"
3/22/2009,im supporting my own proposal
3/22/2009,"i'm going to go out on a limb and guess that ccp will never support this. 30 day plex doesn't equal cash. your just going to have to use a credit card or wait for actual money to come to you. (and if your this low on cash, what are you doing playing eve online?!)no support--isaac"
3/22/2009,"you're asking them to lower their fee a few bucks($2.525), which they likely won't support. i like it in principle, and i'd be in favour of asking them about it(since the above poster is fundamentally wrong, the beauty of plexes is that you can play without spending rl money), but this is a low priority for the csm, because ccp will likely refuse to drop their prices for this service. given the number of more important issues that don't get passed along to ccp, i can't ask the csm to raise this one."
3/22/2009,"so ideas to prevent it lagging too much: - warping or a session change will disable your scanners auto-repeat. - if the auto-repeat has been running for too long, a message will show up. you then have another minute to hit the auto-repeat button, otherwise the auto-repeat will stop. no auto-repeat for afk players."
3/22/2009,"i like the idea of seriously nerfing scrapmetal processing. cap it at 75%, and you will get a 25% drop in mission sourced minerals on the market, as well as a decrease in the effectiveness of mineral compression. 2 birds with one stone."
3/22/2009,"lowering loot drops and switching from drops to bpc's increases the need/usefulness of producers, which is good. lowering the overal income for missions is always good."
3/22/2009,"there's a lot of need for a change in mineral drops from rats, but it has to be done carefully, in a way that ensures things actually settle down reasonably afterwards. this isn't care, this is a bomb dropped right in the middle of the eve economy. a sensible proposal in this vein i'd likely support, but ""screw it all"" is not a proper method of implementing an economy tweak. not supported."
3/22/2009,"no. not well thought out and is simply a ""bomb"" in gameplay. not supported.--isaac"
3/22/2009,"^^thisi agree that mission loot reprocessing is an issue for the economy (especially seeing as i'm primarily a miner), but it needs to be dealt with carefully, not with this ready, fire, aim crap."
3/22/2009,this + the other 2 comments echoing this post.this reeks of unbalanceistic foolishness.
3/22/2009,"excellent idea, would balance a lot of things"
3/22/2009,"this is a bad idea.many people rely on t1 named mods instead of t2 for combat as well as npcing.if one was to remove named drops from missions and such you would create a major vacuum of supplies.also a large portion of minerals that help run this entire game come from reprocessing.running these missions allow us to get the minerals required without spending hours and hours of time mining for crap.i do not see how your proposal would help at all in any way. the mineral market as it is now is doing fine. there are plenty of minerals for new and old industry pilots to use so there is no shortage.doing what you propose would sky rocket all mineral prices. with that being said new industry char's would never be able to start off in their new profession due to the cost and would give a monopoly to well rooted industry pilots.as for the increase bounty that alone is a horrible idea. inflation in this game is at such a high rate that without a loan new pilots have hard times starting out and usually take months before they can afford decent ships/fittings.if anything ccp needs to implement new isk sinks into the game to help reducing inflation.plus i dont look kindly on making all pvp ships, even t1, more expensive to fly/lose."
3/22/2009,"you fail to understand reading, its said add named blue print copies droped. and as you stated you do missions for minerals. see why mininer profesion isnt profitable? new playyers wont be effected much. even if prices would increse 2 times which i doubt cruiser would cost like 10mln. and eve dont have inflation it have deflation llok at all ships,faction mods droping constantly in price. t2 minerals exploit removal only made inflation."
3/22/2009,"i agree with your broader point, though your arguments are kind of weak, but i really have to take issue with this point. i've had buddies who were in decently-fit battlecruisers while they were still on trial accounts, and that's without any outside support purchasing it. prices have been dropping constantly for over two years(at least, until the reactor exploit was fixed, that brought them back up some, but they're still way down), and it's far easier to get established now than it used to be."
3/22/2009,"the cnrs which the market is flooded with come from a different place than lp stores, i don't know if that's a cosmos site, a complex or some hacking sites, but there are people who sell dozens of cnr bpcs each week, of course they won't share their secret. they make tons of isk while cnrs are not an option for missionrunners, and together with a few more factors it causes a constant devaluation of lp.this is especially annoying for lvl5 missionrunners, since lvl5 missions don't give bounties in most cases, lps are the main payment there (up to 70k lp per mission). therefore i generally support the idea of items that require high amounts of lps, such as modules mentioned in op or +6/7 attribute implants, faction battlecruisers/capital ships or even a state issue raven for 50 million lp, or something that stops lp from losing their value even more. it's annoying that empire lp which were worth up to 2000 isk/lp before the lp store was introduced, now sell for around 500 isk/lp when being cashed in in huge amounts."
3/22/2009,"had an encounter with a gang consisting of 4 battleships and 3 falcons. this type of gang with excessive ecm is ruining small gang pvp, my dual eccm domi was jammed several times. vote for lark!!"
3/22/2009,"hopefully all of c&p (&l) gets behind a single candidate so they have a chance of getting in, that candidate should be lark"
3/22/2009,and rats don't get concorded. i think this is an idea which would enhance the quality of the game while slightly increasing the challenges that players face in lowsec.lowsec is a training ground where players can learn about new and exciting features of eve and its mechanics. having angel gatecamps would be a wonderful addition to any lowsec adventure.
3/22/2009,"last i checked amarr reactors ran on antimatter, so it must be fairly common..."
3/22/2009,"the one thing that bugs me is the sheer amount of nerf ccp applied to antimatter ammunition, especially when given what happens when antimatter and matter make physical contact.i remember a documentary on the discovery channel (i think) that gave an example about what would happen if two equally sized masses of matter and antimatter were to collide. in this example, they used the show's narrator as a baseline for the mass of said matter and antimatter packages; the (depicted) resulting explosion would destroy everything on the earth's surface and leave a good-sized crater behind as well.so i find it hard to believe that antimatter ammunition is used as the most powerfully destructive ammunition for blaster and railgun weapons. i could see them being used for weapons of mass destruction... but not for normal naval ammunition.bottom line: this ain't star trek online, folks."
3/23/2009,"not only different, but plese: bigger fonts made possible....12 isn't big enough in alot of cases...14, 16, 18, 20 should be poossible, too.don't say 16-20 would be too big, its tha player's choice after all."
3/23/2009,yup
3/23/2009,please
3/23/2009,is there any offical response from devs ?
3/23/2009,"old effects by far superior.pretty obvious that ccp wanted to improve fps on massive capital jumpins etc, but these new effects are just lame."
3/23/2009,new effect is a bit lame. i for one want a terminator style effect.... eve needs more blue lightning :)
3/23/2009,"yup, the new jump gate effect is awesome! well done! but its doesnt fit for a jump drive. seeing a wormhole open up in space was incredible, so would be good to see it again!"
3/23/2009,"i'm actually supporting a cheater, wtf?i feel dirty."
3/23/2009,i miss the weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeechow.bring it back plz.
3/23/2009,"new effect is pretty dull, looks like low budget bsg style stuff."
3/23/2009,"there is nothing wrong with long range tech 2 ammo. the scorch tracking penalty may not matter much at optimal but your opponent may not let you fight there.these ammos have a purpose and get used, the short range ammo was a bit poo for minnie for whom it added a noticable ammount of damage over gimped emp/rf-emp and pretty horrible for the other races. with the web changes the tracking/range hits make these ammos pointless most fo the time, i know i have removed hail from most(not all) of my loadouts in favour of more boosters/emp/barrage/exotic dancers.quick point to the cry abies complainging their tech 2 guns are not good enough....... get a grip!typicaly +8% damage from spec. raw stats equsal to best named.lower cost than best named for most weapons(very large for lasers).option to use both tech 2 ammos including the usefull one.i also don't see the point of the hating on the free faction ammo. it taks normal ammo + isk + lp to make and the sell price has been forced down to tiny margins, only way to make cash with it is to shuip it to places where people want to supply without going to a hub and thats no different to anything else."
3/23/2009,t2 ammo needs a boost/removal of stupid penalties. only t2 ammo that is actually used are some javelin/null types (range) and barrage. sometimes rage hams are good too but situational.
3/23/2009,"i dont completely agree with this for a number of reasons. while i do think some faction ammo and some t2 ammo is a bit screwed one way bear in mind theres also a screw the other way. for example while obviously for a vagabond faction emp is normally best for close range work you would never choose pretty much any other faction ammo (possibly phased plasma at a push) because for slightly onger range work barrage is just insanely better than anything else. there is a similar story with long range guns, yes at close range faction emp/antimatter/multifrequency is better than quake/gleam/javelin but then at long range other than very occasionally when using hacs to kill frigates where tracking might matter tremor/aurora/spike is way way better than faction carb lead/radio/iron due to not only its extra 20% range but also its much improved damage.at the same time faction guns now suck because of some t2 ammo being overpowered and someone even suggested faction guns should use t2 ammo which i approve of. my alternative to that would be make faction ammo for faction guns only however give some of the faction ammos some quirky bonuses. anyway i will sign this because i would like faction guns discussed and that involves faction ammo so perhaps this will bring faction guns into discussion too.finally the ammo issue really boils down to the fact that when t2 ammos were nerfed the close range ones got hit way way too hard and should recived more damage/much less negatives than currently (and they have more negatives than long range ones and yet no real positives) and possibly some positives like for example a speed boost on hail or void (since you need to burn in to use them) not a redction."
3/23/2009,"depending on situations yes, a rupture/cane with hail will wipe the floor with one using rf emp for instance... another use is when you're shooting something 1 size larger than you... t2 always seems to beat faction then..that said, i agree t2 ammo needs a -small- unerfing (read: remove some of the negative effects, remove tracking penalty would be awsome!). also, shortening the insane build times would be nice as well..."
3/23/2009,"blast from the past here. i know some of my thoughts are plastered all over page 1, but that was all negative. i've done some thinking, and here's some actual suggestions, instead of arguing. we've got three types of ammo. t1 is cheap, simple, and boring. faction is expensive, simple, and does a lot of damage. t2 is expensive, complicated, tends to do a lot of damage, but is generally nerfed to hell and gone. the only t2 ammo that sees use is the stuff that gives you something novel at a cost that isn't unreasonable - spike/aurora/tremor give you reasonable dps at gargantuan range, and scorch gives you the ability to fire pulse lasers at low-end beam ranges without sacrificing dps. the other eight, however, are garbage - void/conflag/hail give tiny dps increases for massive penalties, null/barrage give range bonuses to weapons with no range, and javelin/gleam/quake are just void/conflag/hail zoomed out. of the six range ammos, four are good, and barrage is salvageable, likely by upping the falloff bonus. null is problematic, but really, a +200% optimal bonus or something isn't totally unreasonable for blasters, and that'd sort of put it in the same category as the others. of the six damage ammos, you've got a grand total of zero that are genuinely usable, and three that see some use in hyperspecialized fits or, more realistically, eft pimping(i've even been guilty of the latter myself at times). this says to me that the ""raw dps"" niche should be left to faction ammo, and t2 should find a new one. many are possible, but the first that comes to mind is tracking. if hail, instead of nerfing range and cap recharge to get dps, instead did the same or less dps than emp at the same range, but had mods of -50% sig radius and +100% tracking speed, then it might see some use. it certainly wouldn't exist solely as a trap. as possible side benefits, you could quite conceivably make some kind of capless ammo for lasers and hybrids(no, capless lasers aren't broken when they use ammo), or a smaller charge size so an effectively limitless amount can fit in the guns, or even a lower rof and a higher burst damage(especially on the artillery ammo) to up the alpha-strike damage. maybe mix around the damage types somewhat too - who wouldn't like a projectile round that did all four damage types equally? these aren't definite suggestions, but they are ideas for a direction the devs could take the currently-lame t2 ammos in that would see at least a little bit of use, doesn't step on the toes of faction or t1, and doesn't require being nerfed into oblivion."
3/23/2009,support.

3/23/2009,didn't know this issue already existed.now i do.
3/23/2009,more range and actual effectiveness with damps would make my arazu useful again.
3/23/2009,"i wholeheartedly support this idea. it is a fantastic player interaction idea attached to a material faucet, it enhances the self sufficiency of small null sec nations and provides more things to do in eve.two thumbs up."
3/23/2009,hell yes.
3/23/2009,"i for one support this, although i haven't yet seen ""the veldnaught""."
3/23/2009,supported!
3/23/2009,"so basicly, the veldatar doesn't need to be moved into amarr to join its son the veldnaught.while this would cause me epeen to rage throughout new eden i'm sure it would also be a good tourist trap. i am faily confident that such a move would cause the major ccp favorism waggon to run on mwd's - so the proposal is, that if the veldatar cannot be moved to the favorism reason, the veldatar could be seen as a gift for the ego of chribba becoming a monument (like the luminare titan) with my name attached.we would then have created the how-the-hell-can-ccp-let-people-spend-90-billion-isk-to-get-in-game-monuments-waggon.what this basically means is you have seen other dreads and carriers in high sec but want to be spesial."
3/23/2009,oh please stop pretending you want this for anything other then your own epeen.you simply want to be the only one to have something so you can look all special. and the truth is revealed.hell no! you don't need to get more special treatment.
3/23/2009,what a terrible idea.
3/23/2009,qfti'm so glad at least a small percentage of people here haven't been infected with the 'celebrity' obsession.

3/23/2009,"each race pos has bonuses to their own racial weapons, such as minni to projectiles and gallente to rails etc.the caldari tower give bonuses to ecm, which is awesome btw, but also to missile arrays. the missile arrays are not bad if you look away from the non insta dmg etc, but they have one problem which makes it impossible for them to be practical.they use cpu.pos mods that use cpu, like tackling arrays, hardeners etc. go offline when a pos is reinforced and cannot be onlined while its reinforced.mods that dont use cpu, such us guns, on the other hand stay online even if the pos is reinforced. that means even if your pos is reinforced, a fleet cannot just sit and camp you inside your pos but has to deal with the pos guns as well.this is most critical for when the pos comes out of reinforced, where online guns can, especially when manned, add thousands of dps to cover the repairing of the tower - launchers would be offline.my suggestions would be to either remove the cpu requirement on launchers, or give them a special role allowing them to stay online even when the pos gets reinforced even tho they still use cpu.copied from the game development forum"
3/23/2009,"even ignoring the cpu, and even ignoring the delayed hit, missile turrets are still the worst pos defences in the game. a cruise launcher does half as much dps per unit of pg than any other pos defence in the game(even on a caldari tower, it does a whopping 17 dps). torpedoes are lower dps/pg than any turret, and have mediocre range. citadels aren't as offensively bad - they do the most dps/pg of any long-range defence, but they take a lot of cpu, and take as much as two minutes to hit. still, it's clear that missiles need a complete working-over - either dramatically cut their rof, or give them something else to compensate for how much they suck at present. and yes, a role bonus letting them fire when the pos gets reinforced would be a good way of removing at least some of the suck from their cpu use."
3/23/2009,"i can really only see more nerfs to pvp coming with future patches, fixing this exploit would be counter productive to that process and as such ccp isn't going to fix this issue.keep fighting the good fight, but it's a waste of time."
3/23/2009,"if you actually get disconnected at the wrong time what the hell makes you think you should be 100% safe? if you disconnect in a level 4 mission while rats have you scrambled, do you log back on in a pod? if you disconnect while trying to solo a hac in a t1 frig, do you survive? then why should you be safe if you disconnect when you jump into a gate camp, or at a ss while the guys you just took pot shots at are probing you out? **** happens. if you really disconnect and get killed, too bad, suck it up.the following needs changed desperately to put a stop to entire fleets logging off, and the 3 @#%!wads that have been hanging around our space all week, logging on, ganking someone, and logging off with total impunity, and other such ******ation.1) no ship should ever, ever ever vanish while it is locked, scrambled, and being fired on. ever.2) fix the log on and immediate log off/on again exploit to avoid coming back to where you initially logged off.3) fix the jump clears aggression timer exploit ( yes, it still works )4) increase the non aggro vanish timer from 30 seconds to 2 minutes. why? every other game balances log off timers to prevent you from getting away if an enemy is close to catching you if you had not logged off anyhow. even without aggro you should stick around just long enough for an accomplished prober who is already looking for you to find you. if they were hot on your tail and you tried to ditch, you should be toast.5) like every other mmo, when you quit the logoff countdown should start, and you should be able to sit there while your ship is waiting to vanish at the safe spot. if you get attacked then the logoff is aborted and you can defend yourself, if not, then the client closes when your ship vanishes and you know you will be safe until you log on again."
3/23/2009,"this is the first, most basic thing that needs to be done. i don't see how that would be ""too much work"" for ccp, so that shouldn't be an excuse"
3/23/2009,yeah no **** we need that!
3/23/2009,yeah once i fly a capital it should be capital sized [where would it lead if a e-peen doesn't get bigger ^^]
3/23/2009,"i would much rather see the anchoring skill to allow the onlining/anchoring/unachoring of multiple modules at once per person (with the number of modules being dependant on the level of the anchoring skill (1 per level) for onlining modules you might need to have the ability to online one from the start. this would include the ability for multiple people to online/anchor thins with no limithowever at the same time because of the ability to online/anchor/unachor multiple things at once i believe doubling the timers (for silos/harvesters/reactors ect which are allready 20 minutes fo unachoring, not sure about anchoring, any increase would probably need to be smaller as 40 minutes is extreemly excessive and people cant allways be on that long) for most such actions would balance things out a bit (so at level 2 you could online/anchor/uachor twice as much but with double, in most cases, time so you would end up the same as now and only at lv3 would you save time over now while lv 5 will only make a big diffrnce on poss that take 5-6+ hours right now."
3/23/2009,u mad?
3/23/2009,supporting the **** out of this
3/23/2009,"fully supported, love the ideajust spent 4/5 hours unanchoring a pos and spent 4/5 hours last night anchoring one.and that was only a small!!"
3/23/2009,back to the top until it gets supported in a csm meeting
3/23/2009,"*sigh*please refrain from breaking the forum rules.i already stated that i support this topic. however we have been busy with preparing for, and having, our second meeting with ccp.so just be patient."
3/23/2009,supporting this.
3/23/2009,i would like to see an aggression timer -or- just a plain jump/dock timer posted for the pod pilot just like they get in empire space.current game mechanic1) you cannot use gates because of aggression just like in empire ... but are left spamming the button becuase you have no clue where you stand time wise2) you cannot dock because of aggression just like in empire ... (see above)what i would like to seethe addition of an actual timer (like in empire) so i know when i can go through the gate -or- dock up.
3/23/2009,no.edit: see below - opinion changed after thread was edited.
3/23/2009,the whole point of 0.0 is the fact there is no law.that means no aggression timer... that means no concord sanctioned law enforcement let alone faction enforcement on stargates.in short... no.in 0.0 there are no rules... do as you please. let's keep it that way.
3/23/2009,this has nothing to do with rules .. its about the game mechanic ... if there are no rules as you say .. why cant i dock or jump after i shoot someone ...ever try jumping through a gate after shooting someone ... well you can't ... be it in 0.0 or empire. but for some reason .. in empire you get a little timer and in 0.0 you dont which leaves you guessing when you can jump ... in short ... you're a douche bag
3/23/2009,no one said eve was easy.oh and thanks for the compliment.
3/23/2009,"i'm not sure the above posters understand this correctly or if the op edited after the responses.when you aggress something, you get an invisible 60 second timer during which you cannot dock or jump. this happens in all security ratings of space. ditto with the 15 minute timer and logging off mechanic.op is simply asking for that timer to be displayed somewhere on the screen. why wouldn't you want such a timer displayed?it really doesn't make sense that a pvp game wouldn't have the rules of aggression someone on your ui but if you aggress an npc rat, oh a big yellow aggression timer comes right up. it would help out new players understand game mechanics. support."
3/23/2009,well in that case... makes sense... so long as the mechanics aren't changed... i don't have a problem with it...but i don't think your going to get anywhere with it either.... there's probably a good reason why there isn't one.
3/23/2009,"okay, now that i actually understand what you're asking for, i can support this. i thought you were suggesting a mechanical change - if it's just an issue of the time not being displayed properly, then i of course would prefer that get fixed."
3/23/2009,"yeah, why not. we have the session timer already, why not also have the 60 sec and the 15 min aggro timers."
3/23/2009,a visible timer would be nice especially for businesses such as docking and undocking.the only way to tell if your timer is up atm is to spam with lots of mouse clicks so i think this is a useful addition.
3/23/2009,a small simple change i would support ...
3/23/2009,it should have always been displayed regardless of the sec status of your system. rules apply in all systems: information available in all systems.
3/23/2009,signed
3/23/2009,"like most of the new stuff, except for the pos bubble.. let me turn it down/off.signed"
3/23/2009,its totaly unecessary so i wasn't going to support this but that bolded section is the most tragic thing i have ever heard so thumbs up on this one. its not like it would hurt having more bindable controls.
3/23/2009,yes for bs v over the hols
3/23/2009,"you dont really think ccp will implement ""drugs"" *rolleyes* or something to their teen rated game? [somehow i dont think we have many teens playing this anyway but hey, not my problem]"
3/23/2009,"well, that would be smoking in stations. and i'd rather have jumpdrives instead of gates, however that doesn't exclude being able to smoke in ambulation, now does it?"
3/23/2009,"agree with you sir, time for balance!i would like to propose 3 more thingsn that i would like to see in the list:- ecm/caldari recons/eccm- t1 frigates/cruisers (such as breacher, purifier, navitas, scythe, augoror) could use some love- the ability to use passive shield tank very effective on ships that supposed to armor tank such as harbinger, brutix, myrmidon, ishtar, curse (to an extend)."
3/23/2009,"stealth bombers, black ops, bombs, posses, faction ships, the entire citadel missile system just a few to name of the endless list of being fixed soon (tm).there are lots of things that need fixing asap."
3/23/2009,"no, i did certainly not get that impression. in fact that we discussed that ccp needs to define a period of time, after which they are forced to revisit new features, like black ops.the csm was quite explicit that this was a good idea. it will have to be left to be seen if ccp takes up the idea. but i really hope so."
3/23/2009,"agreed, and in general access control methods need improved significantly so that a corporation can choose not to place such vast power in the hands of one person.oh, and an abstention does not count either way, so if only one person votes yes and everyone else abstains, the vote is carried."
3/23/2009,"i absolutly support this but i also support the disbanding of bobr. everyone has to play by the rules. this mechanic was legitimate at the time, so lets de legitimize it - what bob got was not legitimate."
3/23/2009,"here is the mechanic you are looking for, it already exists:""declaration of executor supportall corporations in an alliance can declare their support for another corporation to fill the executor role. if the present executor does not have the support of more than 50% of the member corporations, he cannot act on behalf of the alliance. the corporation and its ceo will still be listed as the executor, but all administrative functions will be disabled (this is indicated by an error message that is displayed whenever usage of such a function is attempted by the executor). this means that the alliance is effectively powerless until such time as the support of the executor is restored or a new executor is declared through gaining more than 50% of the support of the member corporations. the system will attempt to activate an executor once every 24 hours. only when the established executor regains support or a new one is put in place will access to the administrative functions be restored.as the executor of an alliance is in a position of power, he must be replaced in cases where he does not possess more than 50% of the support of the member alliances, has stopped playing the game or is otherwise unreachable. note that changing the ceo of the executor corporation automatically entails that the new ceo is listed as executor. the procedure through which executors are changed is based on the declaration of executor support, which is a simplified form of voting. every corporation in an alliance can modify their support for the executor at any time. the default setting is to support the current executor. a declaration of support is only valid if a corporation has been a member of the alliance for seven consecutive days. the declaration of support is confidential and is only available to the ceo and directors of the corporation.the alliance system constantly checks whether an executor has 50% or more of the support of the member corporations. if support drops below 50%, the executor will be informed of this through the display of an error message when attempting to use administrative functions."""
3/23/2009,"finally, a logical change thread. although i think the 1 week max voting time is a bit too long . but i can understand it if the ceo is afk but then again that would be a serious problem in of itself."
3/23/2009,"anchoring pos mods (especially outside the shield) is an annoying process as you can not focus your camera on this mod. it becomes increasingly difficult to place a pos mod the further away you place it from the center of the tower.to make this system more user-friendly i suggest this:anchoring modeanchoring mode would mean that your camera will be fixed on a pos mod from an isometric view (picture example underneath).please visit your user settings to re-enable images.from this view you can move the pos mod along a grid on the x and y axis with the arrow keys. if you want to go up and down ( z axis) you simply press the shift key and the up or down arrow. this would allow you carefully and precisely place your pos mod on the desired location with amazing accuracy.some things i feel that should be implemented:- the green box should stay but the arrow removed, also make the box red if you can't anchor the module like this (ofcours this should be a 3d grid but that's not very easy to draw ).please visit your user settings to re-enable images.the stick is the tower, the blue circle the pos bubble and the circles indicate a gun mod being place correctly and incorrectly.- make anchoring mode only available inside the pos shield and make the ship of the player go to a speed of 0 m/s exactly like in siege or triage (this really screws up the current system as well since if you move the pos mod box moves as well)all comments, supports and criticism is welcome.on a side note:this is meant to be an improvement on the current pos mechanics, i am aware that there is a topic running about modular posses but this require an entire redesign of the system which in it's current state still seems unlikely."
3/23/2009,"i personally find it easy as likely for them to patch the current system, as it is for them to redesign the whole thing.edit: how did you draw the grid and the nice circle? looks neat."
3/23/2009,"you are very right on them redesigning the the entire pos system but it has implementation problems. ""how do we replace the floating mods into one structure without breaking the already existing posses?"" is one of the biggest questions.this is why i think making the pos system more user friendly is the easier step at the moment.photoshop"

3/23/2009,i fully endorse this proposal
3/23/2009,"yeah, but a flawed game mechanic that will only have one victim, bob, isn't messed up?please explain why it takes 24 hours to leave a corp, takes 24 hours to join an alliance, takes even 10 hours to destroy a character....but it takes only a millisecond to insta pop a whole alliance? please, explain in a legitimate way without bias how this is isn't messed up?i am all ears."
3/23/2009,why does this not surprise me anymore ?
3/23/2009,or just change the name to band of developers... or just officially bring tanis alliance into the gbc. either. whatever.
3/23/2009,"and if it wasn't for a poor game mechanic, you know, disbanding an alliance in a second when you can't even leave a corp in 24 hours, then there wouldn't be a need to a renaming.this is the **** that makes everyone so angry. while goonsawrm used a valid in game mechanic to remove your alliance (broken or not) you got what no one else has ever gotten. two wrongs never make a right and certainly - petition to change the sov mechanic - but you don't deserve special treatment.its not about whats fair - this isnt hello kitty online - its about he rules, and making you play by them."
3/23/2009,same rules should apply to everyone.
3/23/2009,supporting this idea 100% they can rename all they want but they still have to follow the same rules. either set them back to kenzoku or drop sov and do it right.
3/23/2009,"i support this, currently have 4 petitions over 4 characters on this because this is the worse thing ive seen on a mmorpg ever."
3/23/2009,anyone know if this change will affect sov timers in already contested systems? will they reset etc in a vague attempt to give kenny an advantage in some way as before?
3/23/2009,"eve have tons of poor game design(scam contracts etc,) why all idiots seats there and cry but only bob get restore? yeah it can change alliance name but it must pay bill and loss sov!"
3/23/2009,explain why he was left with the roles after being absent for so long?i am all ears.
3/23/2009,"special consideration for a special alliance, makes me sick."
3/23/2009,one rule for all.
3/23/2009,yea how does this affect pos/sov timers and such?
3/23/2009,"straight from the rulebooks:""the executor of an alliance is given the authority to act on behalf of the alliance in all matters. this authority is subject to review by the alliance council. the limitation to a single executor simplifies the operation of the alliance system, however it also places a great deal of responsibility on the member corporations to oversee the actions of the executor. at present there is no formal alliance-wide voting system on alliance actions and policies in place, and while this is in development the use of a single executor corporation offers a suitable workaround when combined with the declaration of executor support.""this would include kicking corps out of and disbanding alliances. it was not a 'quit' it was a disband abd those takes seconds and a mouseclick.not a flawed game mechanic, but simply a mechanic...."
3/23/2009,seems like there is a substitute for internalk security - ccp gm's/dev's
3/23/2009,yall should just calm down and send a friendly email to internalaffairs@ccpgames.com and explain your concerns
3/23/2009,"if you think that something happened, which shouldn't have, then contact internal affairs rather than trying to cause drama.it's bloody obvious that, that's the entire point of this."
3/23/2009,"quoted for the less intelligent. i can look at all of the threads that goons post and can see crap loads of people with all intents and purposes doing what amounts to ""parodies an existing player, corporation or alliance"". i don't see anyone *****ign and moaning like little girls about that. nah, because they are pro-goon. it's that simple. this amounts to nothing more than a tantrum."
3/23/2009,disband them!
3/23/2009,not the only victim. and it's no ones fault but molle's for throwing around roles willy nilly. if sov attacks are so awful can ccp put the 100b finfleet evaced from a goon station a short while ago back into a goon station?
3/23/2009,disband the cheaters!
3/23/2009,"wow as if the prior favoritism and devs in bob spawning **** for them and other ****, they do it again. gg ccp gg"

3/23/2009,i want my name changed to sandy vagina.

3/23/2009,i want to be able to change my name too :(
3/23/2009,ohh damm we killed kenny.

3/23/2009,"now i know that my small contribution to ccp's coffers makes no real difference, but this is likely the proverbial 'straw' which, if left unaddressed, will break the back of the camel that is my continued subscription to the eve-online service.i am continually losing confidence in ccp as a company in the face of incidents such as this which show blatant favoritism. the fact that bob got disbanded due to what some consider a flawed game mechanic has nothing to do with it. it has been ccp policy that no name changes occur, and this is a complete reversal of that policy. to add to this insult, the fact that this alliance was able to circumvent a 1,000,000,000 isk fee as well as sov reset... well lets just say that i am not exactly happy with ccp at the moment and am feeling the desire to find something more productive to do with my $45 a month in subscription fees and time spent playing eve.ccp please address this glaring circumvention of established rules, if the unwashed masses are forced to follow the rules, so should bob/kenny/rebob/whatever..."
3/23/2009,so how does it feel to be in a group of cheaters? i mean it's obvious it happened once again and you can't really deny itso how does it feel?

3/23/2009,i never thought something like that would go over my lips...well...my fingers....whatever...but the goons are just ****ing right.1 game 1 rule
3/23/2009,"simple the mechanic you speak of is a 'quit' not a disband.the 'quit' mechanic is so people cannot wardec and avoid wardecs simply by quitting alliances and corps. the disband option has no such exploit associated so it is instant and the executor corp and that ceo is empowered to do anything up to and including disbanding the whole thing.following is why he was still allowed to do so. bob was complacent and should have payed attention.quote from ccp rulebooks:""declaration of executor supportall corporations in an alliance can declare their support for another corporation to fill the executor role. if the present executor does not have the support of more than 50% of the member corporations, he cannot act on behalf of the alliance. the corporation and its ceo will still be listed as the executor, but all administrative functions will be disabled (this is indicated by an error message that is displayed whenever usage of such a function is attempted by the executor). this means that the alliance is effectively powerless until such time as the support of the executor is restored or a new executor is declared through gaining more than 50% of the support of the member corporations. the system will attempt to activate an executor once every 24 hours. only when the established executor regains support or a new one is put in place will access to the administrative functions be restored.as the executor of an alliance is in a position of power, he must be replaced in cases where he does not possess more than 50% of the support of the member alliances, has stopped playing the game or is otherwise unreachable. note that changing the ceo of the executor corporation automatically entails that the new ceo is listed as executor. the procedure through which executors are changed is based on the declaration of executor support, which is a simplified form of voting. every corporation in an alliance can modify their support for the executor at any time. the default setting is to support the current executor. a declaration of support is only valid if a corporation has been a member of the alliance for seven consecutive days. the declaration of support is confidential and is only available to the ceo and directors of the corporation.the alliance system constantly checks whether an executor has 50% or more of the support of the member corporations. if support drops below 50%, the executor will be informed of this through the display of an error message when attempting to use administrative functions."""

3/23/2009,"support this, they should have lost all sov if they wished to change there name. eula even has a section regarding changing name if the name is offensive, the kenzoku alliance name is not an offensive name if you even check in google. should ccp decide to keep this they will lose a number of subscriptions due to ccp showing a bias in this decision to allow a change as small as a name to an alliance known for strong connections with ccp, e.g. moon exploit - having 20 control towers setup the same way in 1 system, then the moon exploit came out and the towers came down.t20 - bpo spawns"

3/23/2009,supporting this.
3/23/2009,"this just in - after careful review ccp has determined that ""band of brothers reloaded"" exceeds the alliance name character limit and has corrected the error by shortening it to ""band of brothers"".i mean, we wouldn't want to break any rules now, would we? voted +1"
3/23/2009,hrghrhg. damn forums and their ****ty software~
3/23/2009,there all bloody engaged atm think its your fault/me shakes fist
3/23/2009,"yah, except there is a policy of returning ships lost due to bugs. there is also a policy of never providing requested name changes, which seems to have been ignored for you.i don't expect you to see why this is wrong, as bias as you are, but it is."
3/23/2009,don't blame .bob. but ccp.
3/23/2009,"the issue is not that ken tried it ... it is that ccp allowed it, broke all the rules in the book and blatantly disregarded their own eula."
3/23/2009,so does free t2 bpos from devs. bob will die soon and proven to an alliance of fail that cant make a stand even with dev's help. move on goons kick this cheater out of eve
3/23/2009,"haha, i love how you all ;_; over a name change."
3/23/2009,"has it been confirmed that this was ccp intervention or is this just speculation?if ccp decided to start providing alliance renaming services, what are the rules to request one? and how much do they charge?"

3/23/2009,"bobr should be changed back to kenny, they picked it, they keep it."
3/23/2009,why did they get special treatment and be allowed to rename their alliance? ccp would've told any other alliance no. this is just another example of ccp bowing down to their pet alliance.
3/23/2009,there at least needs to be a full investigation and explanation into how this was allowed
3/23/2009,"to those threatening to quit, can you please for the love of god quit already. your inability to emo rage quit properly and not just use it as some kind of pressure tool is the reason that we're currently having to cope with lag fests.so emo whining ***gots, you are the ones ruining my game, now get out! :-)traderjohn, quit already, you've quit when t20 got outed, you've quit when you lost your aeon and your alliance got spanked harder than ever in a less laggy situation than what's normal in today's eve... and yet... you're gonna quit again!?"

3/23/2009,yothat's all stuff that happens in game. it's cool.special favours from the devs for favoured alliances aren't the same thing. they're not so cool.kenny don't need dev help. they're better than us.
3/23/2009,whats up ccp
3/23/2009,perhaps they just did it to **** you off ;)but your politeness is disturbing...
3/23/2009,"better at self destructing your moros's and logging with aggro, i've killed you both times when you tried these stunts, no its pretty clear that you're failed iteration of terrible alliance isnt even better than atlas or c0ven."
3/23/2009,only character names that are deemed as inappropriate are eligible for a possible name change. names will not be changed for any other reason. null
3/23/2009,it is not just goons upset by this. ccp is giving special teatment to a group of players above and beyond the status quo. gbc members should (and are) just as outraged by this as this is disegards you as a player and basically says the rules apply to most but not all.
3/23/2009,mayeb kezoku meant somthing very very dirty.... so got changed ;)but seriously... name dont matter.. we aint going away
3/23/2009,"says the guy whose alliance leader got totaly legitimate titan loss reimbursed just because gm team is worse then isd dept.as my friend justin timberlake said - ""what goes around, comes around"", we nailed it again. gm team still didnt replied to my petition that his avatar loss in 8wa-z6 should be reimbursed aswell, so we could kill it again, and again."

3/23/2009,do it!
3/23/2009,not fair...
3/23/2009,disband them please.
3/23/2009,"yes, the name doesn't matter.the ignoring of established precedent regarding character, corporation, or alliance name changes. the circumvention of the usual requirements of remaking an alliance, spending 1 billion isk and resetting all sovereignty claims. ccp preferential treatment (yet again).those matter."
3/23/2009,exactly.
3/23/2009,"while this was most likely just a single employee going off the reservation, and can be fixed without disbanding, it remains an issue that should be addressed publicly by ccp.supported in the sense that i wish to see rules applied evenly across all players, and to see those that cannot be held accountable for their action."
3/23/2009,heh
3/23/2009,"so many rules broken. this should not have been possible, this is not how it should have been done."
3/23/2009,"as csm i'm not going to touch this with a 10ft pole, as person i think this is messed up."
3/23/2009,"i remember after bob were disbanded people sadly joking to each other ""wait till ccp rename the new alliance back to bob, right?"". well, even sadder, it's happened. and... well, this is now headed to easily be the largest csm thread. which says a lot.everyone should play by the same rules. any inconsistency in how these rules are enforced entirely breaks eve as an ecosystem and environment.this decision should at the very least be reversed. whoever is responsible for this within ccp, be it a gm, dev or isd should be at least named and shamed and if not internally disciplined. this is what ia was created for; it's time to see if the loss of some of eve's greatest architects (who left due to the creation of ia and/or the sea-change it instigated in ccp's ethos) was worth it. if no action is taken against any employees or the decision is not reversed, it will be a sad day for eve- this will be yet another documented, publicly displayed (i'm just waiting for this to hit the blogosphere/mmo news sites) example of ccp (or someone within ccp)'s favouritism towards this alliance.on a side note- the maximum character length of an alliance name according to ccp's policies is 24 characters. why is bobr allowed 25 characters?"
3/23/2009,enough is enough. quit with the favouritism!
3/23/2009,this needs to be investigated.
3/23/2009,"dear bobr,you got screwed bad. but you also failed to to secure your own executor corp properly. if you had properly maintained your own house, this would never have been an issue. the failure is your own when you let someone whom you have admitted should not have had director roles have and keep them. ultimately this is your failure, not ccp's, and they should not give you special treatment when they have acknowledged that nothing improper was done. you should lose your new name or pay the price to keep it."
3/23/2009,unless everyone else can change there names now which in the past we havnt been ale too. this is not acceptable and there name should be changed back if they want a new name they need to form a new alliance.
3/23/2009,seriously. i am glad to see that the ccp believes in equal treatment for all.

3/23/2009,"they had several sov 3 systems they should have to sacrifice, not to mention the 1 bil alliance forming fee, so it does matter since other alliances don't have this optionsame rules should apply to everyone, an alliance that has previously been the beneficiary of developer misconduct isn't a particularly smart choice for receiving special treatment"

3/23/2009,"arkanon-do your job!edit after ccp grimmi posted the lead gm position:the problem i have with ccp's rationale is 2 fold.1) the kenzoku alliance already was in existence before bob disbanded. i know. i fought them as kenzoku (and watched them die)before the whole haargoth fiasco. just because new corps join, does that allow them to rename the entire alliance? can goonswarm do the same every time a new corp joins?2) other alliances whose names have had mispelings or captilization errors were told to re do it from scratch (stian alliance / sudden death squad), but former bob/kenzoku gets to find a gm willing to bend the rules just for them. when ars caelestis, my former corp, was forcibly disbanded by our ceo, he camped the corp name so we couldn't reform under it. ars ex discordia didn't just emigrate en masse to an alt corp though. we reformed under our own new name, ars ex discordia, after putting a day's worth of thought and effort into it. ccp would not let the 200 + players keep the corp name over the single ceo that had taken it from us, but we made do and grew from it. the fact that bobr or .bob. or rkz or whatever name they want to be called this month can't do it and need to have gm's interfere on their behalf is not only disingenuous, but also shows faults with the way in which their leadership & the gm's involved handle things."

3/23/2009,same treatment for all.
3/23/2009,well the name for bobr does seem much longer then the field allows. :o
3/23/2009,very smelly ccp
3/23/2009,do it
3/23/2009,not supported. stfu whiner.
3/23/2009,it's the small things that count. it comes down to principle. this is not right.
3/23/2009,this does seem to be an appropriate action.
3/23/2009,my entertainment bacbone....

3/23/2009,internal affairs needs to look into this immediately.
3/23/2009,something is wrong with this
3/23/2009,hopping on
3/23/2009,supporting this.
3/23/2009,"ok according to the ""eve rulebook"" lets breakdown what this actually says.ex<U+FFFD>ec<U+FFFD>u<U+FFFD>tor (g-zky-tr, ks-kytr)n.1. a person who carries out or performs something.2. law a person who is appointed by a testator to execute the testator's will.hmm every definition of an executor, is ""a"" person.. not an entire corporation, not the corporation directors. it defines ""an"" administrator. singular, not plural.so julian, thank you for pointing out this very obvious point and showing what the rulebook actually says. much appreciated!"
3/23/2009,how to fight loneliness?
3/23/2009,why would ccp give preferential treatment over something this foolish? do the developers and moderators ignore the rest of the tos? this travesty must be addressed.
3/23/2009,smile all the time.
3/23/2009,"one game, one rule."
3/23/2009,are you guys from wall street or something? how out of touch can you get? ever heard of 'appearance of impropriety?' i'm theorizing that such concept does not exist in icelandic culture.just rename this game to bob's playground and get it over with.
3/23/2009,shine you teeth 'til meaningless.
3/23/2009,the same rules must apply to all players
3/23/2009,inb4 ccp comes in and bans everyone who supported this and then renames eve online to bob online where you have to have a history of mmo exploitation to register an account.edit: in after the ccp/bob man orgy.
3/23/2009,one game one rule
3/23/2009,"while i can understand the concern with ccp potentially showing favoritism towards bob (especially given past incidents here), i do think the whole alliance disbanding thing was somewhat of a mitigating factor. still, if it's a serious issue to some people, i could see a demand for action (although right now it seems to be primarily bob's enemies and alts posting).what i don't understand is the demand to disband bob. even the original post quite clearly states that this would be a case of developer misconduct, and the solution to this is to...take it out on players? how does that deal with developer misconduct? if you were calling out the person who approved this, and whether that was an unbiased decision, sure, but asking for bob 2.0 to be disbanded is just silly, and to me screams of ulterior motives.if you lose a ship due to a known and confirmed in game bug, and petition it, should the gm simply destroy all ships you own if he feels this wasn't a bug after all?this basically screams like another forum attention stunt by the goons & co."
3/23/2009,interesting how these things tend to break in favor of one group.
3/23/2009,"alliances cannot be renamed. if an alliance wants to change its name, it must first disband (potentially losing all its sov) then reform under the new name - if it doesn't want to risk it, then the old name stands.this is the way it's always been, and the rules have been blatantly ignored in kenzoku's favor. what's so hard to understand?"
3/23/2009,it's pretty bad that we even need threads like this.
3/23/2009,change the name back. they can be called whatever they want imho but they should do it in exactly the same way that the rest of us have to.
3/23/2009,"waaaah, no"
3/23/2009,"the point isnt to delete the alliance to be punitive, but rather that kenzoku would have had to disband itself and pay the fees / lose sov to reform. disbanding bob reloaded merely mitigates the damage done.sure, it isn't a big deal but its fair"
3/23/2009,so what's up with beaver bros. anyway?

3/23/2009,"oh, silly beavers."
3/23/2009,"this is unacceptable ccp, havent you learnt anything from the t20 incident?"
3/23/2009,"sometimes i wonder what you guys would do without bob in the game, you would have nothing to blindly lash your anger out at. people in all nc alliances have been fed such crap and rumors they cant see they are a worse plauge on this game than any other entity ever was or will be."
3/23/2009,yes. bobs ability to manipulate ccp into maintaining a second set of rules on bob's behalf is out of control and has been abided for too long.this should have happened after t20 or when molle cheated his first titan back from max.
3/23/2009,if we decided to change our alliance name to remedialsucks (rsux) without losing sov i'd be ****ed too.
3/23/2009,"seriously, all this crying is making me lmfaoyou already disbanded bob once, and to prevent them to counter anything you want to disband them again? the most that you could demand is to change the name back. disbanding the old alliance (under a new name)? you goon muppets just made me lol @ internetspaceships in front of a girl ;p"
3/23/2009,"i vote no unless ccp wants to let me change my name to ""****nose mcgillicutty"". i'd prolly still vote no, tbqh."
3/23/2009,without bob we'd have a game without a group of people being blatantly favored. man what a crazy world.
3/23/2009,"sticking to old graphics does not make a game turn into world of warcraft. it turns a game into ultima online, eventually kills it off and turns it into something only weird fringe groups of players enjoy for years to come.with the latest upgrade, eve did just make up for the amount of visual quality that it fell behind in comparison to state of the art games. from what i have seen, from what ccp has shown and from what needs to happen for eve to remain successful, there will be much more drastic improvements in the near and medium future.yes, at some point your computer will no longer be able to run the game. that is the point where you have to make your twice-a-decade-upgrade to your hardware.forcing one player to do that, including the risk of losing him, is insignificant to the chance of gaining ten new players. ccp is not a charity crib and support of outdated graphics would cost a lot of money without any relevant additional yield."
3/23/2009,removed. please be civil in your replies. navigator
3/23/2009,"this post has been cleared of inappropriate content.regards,the eve online moderation team"
3/23/2009,"i know this might come as a shock to you, but some people actually play this game to get away from rl money issues. the only reason i can play this game, in fact, is due to etcs that i buy with isk. don't get me wrong, i love this game, but i'm the sole wage earner in a family of four, so money is tight in this house, and eve is a great escape without costing a fortune.if the op means trading in most or all of the value of an etc for a character transfer, i'm supporting this thread."
3/23/2009,"i tend to agree with this. while it's a nice idea and all, there are more important issues."
3/23/2009,no.... there are ramifications being overlooked here.not supported.
3/23/2009,"there is ramifications?like ccp making more money because of the decreased barrier to entry?the increased velocity of isk it will cause trough the plex market?what is being overlooked? i could say that you overlooked something too, without even substantiating my claim. that's too easy."
3/23/2009,use you head man...think about it.trading characters with plex's?that's just the start....it's already way to easy to generate isk.bypassing ccp's fee would make it very easy to kick char's around without restraint.
3/23/2009,"it merely decreases the barrier to entry. as far as i'm aware ccp still makes the money from the plex. someone eventually have to pay for the fee.your statement inherently assumes that trading characters is bad. while there's a point to be made, you don't actually make any."
3/23/2009,your assumption is wrong.i said it was way too easy...that alone could lead to problems.
3/23/2009,"too easy in what sense? i don't see any reason that this ought to be difficult. it's a $20 fee and some information disclosure as-is, this would just change the fee from $20 to $17.475 and let you pay someone else isk to cover the fee for you. it'd be about as easy as before, it's just a lot more convenient."
3/23/2009,"awesome idea! you should also be able to pay with regular gtc. if you do so, you get a transfer and 30 days get added to your subscribtion."
3/23/2009,"you are wrongplayers pay 20 euro, but ccp never gets all of it because you are using a credit card (you are making a transaction), and charge tax from that transaction is already included in character transfer fee.no one will charge you or ccp for using items already existing in game, in your hangar (for example plex). so yes plex equal character transfer fee."
3/23/2009,"get over itthank you, that is all"

3/23/2009,scared? and isn't that the pot calling the kettle black?you all emo-rage-whined your back into your precious name of bob even thought ccp has never allowed a name change of anything at a player request ever.
3/23/2009,"i just want to know what are the new rules for requesting alliance renaming, and how much do ccp charge for this service?i really don't care what ex-bobs decide to call themselves, i just want to know what the rules of the game are"

3/23/2009,itt kenzoku doesn't understand why cheating is a problem for eve online.

3/23/2009,why don't you ask ccp to make you one?
3/23/2009,thank you captain obvious even a guy without 10 years in mmos xp can figure that little tidbit out my problem is that my stuff isnt appearing there or at the place i bought the item. ill post when i have a problem and cant figure out wtf is wrong thats what forums are for to bad if you dont like when i started or how much xp i have ingame.thanks dest yah ive looked through my journal and assets the money was taken out but theres no journal entry stating when or why it was taken out and nothing has appeared in my assets. though 16 hours after i posted this the ship did indeed appear in my inv why it took so long is beyond me.
3/23/2009,oh maybe you forgot to check and now your covering it up.welcome to eve.
3/23/2009,"i won't talk smack like drake, but i will say this - whether your problem is real or not, you picked a terrible way to deal with it. petitions, bug reports, even other forum categories are better ways of dealing with this than submitting a badly-written and unclear bug report to a group whose turnaround time for even the smallest of issues is several months. i don't know whether it was a problem with the game or your stupidity, and really i don't much care, but i can tell you that your issue is not one the csm can deal with sanely, and you're wasting your time trying. this is an agency who deals best with systematic problems - bug reports have no place here unless they're on that scale."
3/23/2009,"i think it would be useful to be able to set how emergency warp behaves.for instance, a delay option would be useful for people who (still) suffer the socket closed error on a regular basis, or simply don't want to go to warp if they disconnect for whatever reason. one to have your ship activate all modules that do not require a target or charges would be useful as well."
3/23/2009,"making log-offski even more overpowered, you say?not a chance in my mind."
3/23/2009,too much potential for abuse. no support.
3/23/2009,"how does staying on grid make logoffski more powerful? you have an immobile, unpiloted ship around that can't activate modules - that's significantly less powerful than the status quo. i'm against this if it is actually abusable, but i'm not seeing it at first glance."
3/23/2009,the post mentions to active all modules which doesn't require lock or target.so basically activate the tank.
3/23/2009,if this can be done without increasing lag i support it.
3/23/2009,"totally unsupported. pumping the scan button is only a mouse click just like all other funtions and sorry about you're wrist and all but this is making it a lot easier for low/0.0 sec dwellers to stay safe. spamming to scan button is not hard to do and the ones that don't know how to use the d-scan are the ones who get caught out, this would be a nerf to pirates and pvp'ers etc and a boost to low sec missioners and ratters."
3/23/2009,"i support this on general principle.however, the on-board scanner needs some severe changes anyway in time for the upcoming 0.0 local nerf. the new scanner would hopefully include autoscan as well as other features."
3/23/2009,"delayed mode local would be an enhancement, not a nerf! i can't wait!"
3/23/2009,here's the problem: it probably can't.i don't support this topic. i think local and intelligence gathering needs an entire overhaul. patching up by automating a task for the player is not my idea of how to fix a problem.
3/23/2009,"the overview is somehow able to work in autoscan mode without any problems (up to a point) pulling significantly more information from the server than a scanner ever needs.perhaps the overview needs a ""scan"" button to place the action burden on the player and alleviate some server stress, right?"
3/23/2009,why don't we have this? (the thing where you hold your left click down and make a square and select multiple items if anyone wants clarification)
3/23/2009,good idea i would prefer this over the shift select option which we have now.
3/23/2009,"all the new shiny stuff is nice and all. but i care more about balancing the game. eventually we might have so much new content in the end, it will be very hard to balance it all. so please start balancing the game! not everybody might agree on some areas but there is a need of looking into this stuff.there is alot of issues that needs to be adress, overpowered or not. - ecm/caldari recons/eccm- artillery- minmatar bs/capitals- blackops- marauders (for pvp)- shield tanks on armor tanking ships. (currently you see shield tanks on armortanking ships more often which is just wrong such as a harbinger, brutix, myrmidon & hyperion)- t1 cruisers such as the scythe & augorour that need a ""buff"" so you will see them used more in pvp & other areas. make them usefull instead of forgetting them. - stealth bombers- blastersthis is just for pvp but i can imagian there is some stuff that needs fixing in industry."
3/23/2009,and ofcourse i support my own idea
3/23/2009,ah matar fanboy there i see...i support the rebalance of the game but not if that means to even more overpower matar ships.
3/23/2009,ah amarr fanboy there i see...i support the rebalance of the game but not if that means to nerf my awesome versatility of the fotm amarr.
3/23/2009,overpower?you obviously don't know minmatar ships do you.this coming from an amarr.... known to be the largest dps output race in the game.yeah... thats rich... what's next jovian tech needing to be introduced?
3/23/2009,and don't forget blasters being unable to track anything in their optimal since the web nerf.
3/23/2009,ill add that to the list
3/23/2009,i really think that ankh was kidding. i sure hope so anyways
3/23/2009,"i don't use blasters, so i don't know. just making a list that should be looked into. balanced or not. if he was kidding, thx for ****ing up the thread."
3/23/2009,how about we try to stick to one thread instead of creating others... that way we can get this issue taken care of more quickly and efficiently.original threadthanks!
3/23/2009,"i'm sorry m8, didn't saw that one - going to help you out with this one :)please ignore this thread people..."
3/23/2009,"1. ok add named bpcs for modules....that means every missioneer would have to go through an industrialist to get his mods....nice thought so industrialists get an even bigger share again?2. mining profession not profitable? hmm lets see, its boring but not unprofitable. its about ""willing to pay"" you miners could try to sell trit for 8 isk now that shutles are out of the way, but you don't, it's a free market system. so don't try to ride it out on other professions.3. no inflation but deflation? where do you live? that might be true for easily available t1, t2 and faction stuff [from the lp-shop mind you] but not for everything there...i've seen annoyling increase in prices over the last months.and while farmable stuff like cnrs etc are going down the ""loot only"" deadsapce and officer stuff is increasing even more. not that the stuff should be common ofc, but the isk flowing into the system allows for higher prices there. 4. hmm cruiser costing 10-15m? hmm and where do you think should a new player get that money from? instead of grinding two weeks for a cruiser now a month? for the oloder players 5m more or less isn't the question, but cruisers are a beginner's ship, too, but hell what do you care?"
3/23/2009,"i think you'd be better off saying that ""level 4 missions give out too many minerals, which makes mining rather redundant and fairly pointless"" rather than giving out your own fix. let ccp decide how to solve the problem. definitely supporting that level 4s give out way too many minerals. level 4s build all of my battleships quite easily with the exception of a little bit of zydrine :)"
3/23/2009,"i assume those are in response to me. 3) the overall economic data accumulated by dr.eyjog indicated steady and prolonged deflationary tendencies in the economy dating from essentially revelations in late 2006, and barring t2 prices in the wake of the dysprosium supply being cut by a third, that trend seems to have continued from all the various market data i've looked at. trit is up, because the low prices of it were always artificial, but all the other minerals are down, and t1 ship prices are edging ever closer to insurance-scam values - battleships have all dropped 10-20% in the last year and a half, since i started looking at their prices. i'm not in the market for officer gear, so i can't comment on what prices have done there, but really it's a sideline to the economy as a whole - meta 0-5 is 95% of the economy, and if prices there are dropping then i call it deflation. i don't care nearly so much what happens to the price of an old l4 missioner's pimped-out officer fit as i do what happens to the price of a cheap pvp battleship, a newbie's first cruiser, or the meta 3-5 fits of the above.4) most of the players i know who have gone through a newbie grind well had 10 mil in their first week, before they got into their first cruiser, in order to have some fallback cash. if you play decently, do things intelligently, and sell your drops at a profit(and jump on a lucky drop worth 5 mil, which happen often enough even in l1 missions), you're fine for money. admittedly, most new players aren't my gamer-geek friends who optimize in their sleep, and don't have experienced players to give them tips on how to progress through the game, but it is certainly possible to progress quickly as a new player, even if cruisers were somehow to double in price(which, incidentally, is an outcome nobody even mentioned as a possibility before you suggested we were asking for it). new players managed to do just fine in the early days when ships sold at far closer to base prices(i.e., millions above where they are now), it wouldn't cripple them to be in the same position again. now, that said, i'm not advocating cruiser prices doubling. it'd almost certainly be bad for the game. i just don't think it'd be a catastrophe like you suggest, and i certainly don't think it'd happen under any conceivable change to the economy."

3/23/2009,no one cyaan test mi bredda derthe higher the monkey climbs the more him expose
3/23/2009,that is a good question. i don't think it has to be. i think the party could make its goal to maintain the freedom to enjoy eve with the widest variety of styles of play. change can be good as long as it doesn't interfere with that goal.issler
3/23/2009,"so if industry is thriving and well-supported, but pirates are getting the shaft from ccp, this party would be fighting for their play style to get more love instead of your own? somehow that seems unlikely - even if that was how you wanted to do things, you couldn't sanely call that an industrialist party. it's always tempting to state your goals broadly, to make yourself sound unassailably virtuous and pluralistic, but it's really not accurate to do so. you're not forming an industrialist party to make sure that the widest variety of careers work, you're forming it to help industrial careers work. there's nothing wrong with that, but it's not the same as what you're saying here. as for pengin's question, i see no need for a bear party to be conservative - for example, removing item drops from npcs is a thoroughly radical proposal, and yet a lot of the industrial players seem to favour it strongly. similarly, many bears were thoroughly opposed to the status quo on suicide ganks several months ago, and lobbied hard(and successfully) to get it changed. there's no real reason why a party with a goal that is not the status quo needs to embody the cautious approach towards change that constitutes a conservative mindset."
3/23/2009,"let me say this first, i'm a carebear and proud of it. however, i think a carebear party (if you will) is illogical. there will be some representation from carebears in any council, so long as the industrial sector actually gives enough attention to vote. if not, the pirate party will win the election easily.that being said, there are some 'hot button' issues for the industrialists - most notably the t1 manufacturing sector (removing t1 meta 0 loot from npcs - still waiting on feedback from ccp), and the mining overhaul (making it interesting and not an afk-easy activity). i've supported these issues and worked tirelessly on ways to implement them, but we're waiting on ccp's feedback in order to progress any further."
3/23/2009,"interesting and very vague start. now, lets get down to what you propose and how you will vote. are you mainly for pvp or pve (and no, i don't believe you will be evenly split)? what changes would you propose to make the game better? how much time and effort are you willing to devote to the csm (as it's not an easy job), or are you just here for the free trip?these questions will help people better get an idea of who you are and what you stand for. answer them or not, it's your choice."

3/24/2009,"here on barrage you are hugely wrong any decent minnie pilo will tell you barrage is god, if anything it is possibly the best t2 ammo around admittedly on frigates the diffrence is less noticable but on even a muninn or ru[ture wiht good skills barrage will get you a faloff of 14-15km rather than 9-10km and that gives you a huge advantage in certain circumstances. not to mention the vagabond where you can get well over 20km falloff (over 30kms if you faloff rig it which now post qr is not unreasonable) and on larger ships (i like cheap rigged tempests) you can get 45km faloff. while you dont do max damage when fighting in faloff (obviously) any minmatar will tell an eft warrior that thats where they fight so the eft figures presented are not real (not that they every are) anyway my point is thats where we minmatar pilots fight and while it is not perfect and i would love an extra 200% falloff that would just be silly (vagas with up to 60km faloff or tempests with 90km). remember at optimal + faloff you do 1/2 damage not 0 thats at optimal + 2x faloff. as for null yes its kind of broken but again +200% would just be silly it would also change the way each races close range guns are balanced (amarr longest but low tracking high damage, minmatar short but able to go longer but for loss of dps good tracking lowish base damage (many minmatar ships have 2 damage bonus while amarr/gallente have just one to make up for this), gallente short good tracking, which some might not believe but check stats, and high damage) i would be more in favour of a 30-35% increase in both optimal and falloff rather than the +25% atm. however one problem null faces is not so much that its really that bad but more the idea that blasters must be used at point blank range."
3/24/2009,"there are situations when you want the 1.45% extra damage and where you will not miss any shot. so it has a role, a fairly limited one, but it still offers an advantage, one almost as good as training the specialization skill a level and when you have that at 5 already you look for more opportunities to increase your damage.-vardemis"

3/24/2009,"my main incentive to stay out of 0.0 space is the tendancy for gates from low-sec to 0.0 to be camped by either pirates or alliances who have control freak issues ove entire regions. one has to rent permission at ludicrous prices from these people to be allowed past their doors without being killed and then pod-killed on sight.even in a shuttle! going out!and nearly every access point to 0.0 seems to ""belong"" to someone lately. so i stay in high-sec and the occasional trip through low-sec, due to the inevitable death awaiting me if i so much as try to enter ""no-sec""."
3/24/2009,"it's not inevitable death. there are many ways to get through ""owned"" systems. it's just a matter of a little know-how and practice. despite what they want you to think, the alliances don't control anything outside thier own pos shields and the targetting range of the blobs. i highly advise joining up with a 0.0 corp for a while to learn the techniques for flying without concord protection. once you learn to survive in 0.0 without permission from others, there is no place in the galaxy you cannot fly."

3/24/2009,in the tos they say that you agree that you are at least 18 years or older if you subscribe to the game. sounds old enough to smoke in most countries of the world.
3/24/2009,do not support. we don't need smoking in eve.
3/24/2009,yes. please. tell us more. ;-)so they aren't very useful atm. shrug. it's not like we have no other ships to choose from. treat them like they don't exist yet. will get useful one day when ccp gets some nice ideas for them worked out - or not. doesn't really matter. eve doesn't need those ships. there's *plenty* others to choose from.1. i very much doubt they are countless. what you probably meant is more than you cared to count. which to me translates to probably 2-3. none of the very important.2. you don't really want to whine about past (aka fixed) issues - do you? what would be the point of that?low sec seems fine to me.i can only assume that you think it doesn't give you as much reward as you'd like compared to hi-sec? shrug - non-problem.in what way is a trit shortage an issue and not a trade opportunity?here are some ideas that i could come up with at a moments thought:1: not everything you (plus a bunch of others or not) consider an issue is an issue.2: some things aren't easy to fix even if agreed that it is an issue3: some things simply aren't important enough to put limited resources into. you're probably right with this one.largely true - i guess. though many do come back.really - if anybody left the game because a few ships have design issues or there is a shortage of trit in the drone regions - err - well - good riddance.plus - i don't see how they will manage to find greener pastures - it'll probably be a never-ending tale of testing new game - oohh - exciting - damn found some issues - next game.it's not like other mmos are flawless and most attempt to do much less than eve.i can only speak for myself here - but there's still not a single mmo on market that - imho - comes close to what eve does. ymmv of course. so even a flawed eve - for me at least (well and close to 300k other people obviously) - is better than another (probably also flawed) mmo.i don't follow other mmos closely - but can you give a couple of examples? but be prepared to be laughed at if it is a mmo with *much* simpler feature sets (which of course covers most of them). it's much easier to fix a bike than a space shuttle.see above. rather obvious i think.what astounds me about messages like this is that this is so obviously not true.
3/24/2009,"but we already know what happens then - people will whine about lack of new features.see quantum rise (with accompanying stacklessio etc... anti-lag measures).it's really simple if you take a step back and think about it.from ccps point of view - a percentage of players will grumble, whine and/or leave - no matter what they do.so they have to constantly guess what mix of new features, re-balancing and bugfixes should get the attention of a limited pool of designers, devs and qa people.some people get super-excited about black-ops ships while i couldn't care less if they are useful or not (there's tons of ships to choose from - can't fly them all anyway).others might welcome more npc-activity in market or consensual-only pvp combat while for me that would break the game."

3/24/2009,"plenty of old issues have been fixed (a recent one was speed gone wild ;-) ) - it's just that those then are forgotten very quickly - and of course newer players don't know they every existed.but more importantly - it's not just ccp being in love with new features - it's clearly players demanding them. there's plenty of whine-threads about qr lacking in features - while ccp was busy reducing lag - which was the most requested feature ever.they (ccp) can't win this.new features - fix issues first.fixing issues - where are the cool features??? is eve stagnating?thanks for providing 2 great example:1) user moddable ui. i get that this is important to you and why not - we all have our personal preferences. to me it's a nice to have but i'm fine with current ui meanwhile. to me user-moddable ui doesn't make my top 10 list.2) pos/sov - almost universally agreed that this could use some serious changing - including ccp. they already said they want to and plan to change it. do you really think they keep this on the backburner because - well - why really do you believe they haven't totally changed one of the most important mechanics of 0.0 existence?perhaps - i'm just guessing here ;-) - perhaps because it's not an easy thing to change. and we don't need just any old change - we need an improvement. a big improvement actually to make the effort and disruptions worthwhile. hm - sounds to me like a big deal with designers brainstorming over it for months, constantly debating consequences, devs doing tests environments, qa feeding back problems, etc...err, what? new sov mechanics *are* a new feature. or did you just want to finetune the number of days to gain next sov level? don't think so.and again we have an example of something that's important to some and unimportant to others.imho low sec is ok as it is. there's danger when i transport something and there's a decent chance i can find some action when we fly a combat gang looking for pirates. yes - i know it's pretty easy to make good money in high sec doing mining or missions. but - shrug - so what. perhaps low sec is not a big money maker most of the time for most people. easy solution - don't go there. problem solved.to me low sec provides an occasional challenge on route to someplace else or a nearby place to find some limited action. if i want to make big bucks i can slave in empire or go directly to 0.0 (again with occasional low sec gate camps on the way).why actually do you think it needs fixing?<list of a zillion features/issues small and big>you do realize that the amount of effective work you get out of devs/designers/qa is limited and that the list of such people at ccp is also limited (don't get me started on how productivity per person gets down when too many people are on a team - see mythical man month). given that there's just no way to fullfill your/our wishlist - even in the *very few* cases where we all agree on the need for a fix - in a short time."
3/24/2009,"i think ccp have been concentrating on things ""under the hood"" such as stackless io, new blades and database optimisations. these frankly are the most important as they affect everyone in the entire game.in addition they bring out new content every 6-8 months, and are working on wis (walking in stations).maybe they need to continue on the ""under the hood"" stuff but slow down their new content deployment and spend more time concentrating on external issues that affect players. i'm sure people would happily have a slower content expansion in exchange for issues being resolved more quickly."
3/24/2009,"glen, serious...all what i see in all those posts is:- you talk like you work at ccp (which you don't, if so, post with your main)- you seem to be trying your best to make the op a fool. while everybody (atleast i am) understands him. we might not agree on surtain details. which is just fine. nobody ever agrees on the details anyway. so the basic idea that the op is trying to bring is that ccp should focus more on balance issues then bringing the ""shiny"" stuff. but do not act like somebody is uber stupid and you know all better. if you really ""care"" about the game and the community (which you should if you post in csm area) i suggest you try to help the op better to formulate his idea/issue better. if we would discard every single idea in the game just because one person doesn't agree, then this game wouldn't be at the point where it is now. to the op: i would suggest you remove the list because people will just pick you off and try to make your post like ****. just bring the issue on table. which is: ""there should be more focus on balance"""
3/24/2009,"then explain one fact to me - why is it that so many other game balance changes (from video game updates to board and card game addendums) can be made by other companies so quickly?other games that are just as complex have changes made very quickly. eve? nope. issues that are known to be horribly unbalanced take months or years to address.take for example auto-training, which existed in eve for a short time. moving modules to or from a ship would train a relevant skill very slowly, adding up to a lot of skill points very quickly. this change was added and removed very, very quickly. take blatant exploits as another example. plenty of changes are made very, very quickly.common sense in game design does not require months of mulling over or contemplation for validation. nor do the actual code changes take any longer than weeks in the case of even the most complex. ccp themselves are evidence of this. they've moved quickly in the past.black ops are a fine example. ccp know they're broken. they came into the game intentionally broken. the csm board has reminded them of this. do you honestly think it takes over a year to brainstorm a solid design for them? if so, you haven't a clue about game design... and you're lacking common sense.your fanboi post is admirable. i love eve. i've loved it since beta. but closing ones' eyes and expelling hot air as defense isn't going to get anything done."
3/24/2009,"also, a few highlights from your post to illustrate your naivete.so, what your saying is just continue to condone ccp's lack of action on a balance issue and then the problem goes away? great idea. let's do what glen says and just wait a few more years. ccp can just get to black ops when they feel like it. with ambulation on the way who cares about black ops, right?that's funny, because low sec isn't fine. ccp knows it isn't fine. they've known it isn't fine. see where your voluntary ignorance gets you. you think low sec is fine, yet low sec isn't fine. others acknowledge the problem, you don't. is it still a problem? yes. has it been a problem for years? yes.ignoring a problem is not a solution. do you honestly think solving this particular problem takes years of thought?your above comment is laughable. financial/economic exploits (such as the recent massive pos exploit) in eve also present great 'trade opportunities'. does that make it good game design in your little world?just because opportunities are presented does not suddenly validate a design choice.dismissing ccp's lack of action or simply pleading ignorance to a problem is not going to get these issues solved. your hot air and apologetics are sort of sweet in an innocent way, but they aren't going to solve problems."
3/24/2009,"actually, aside from the speed nerf in qr, which wasn't welcomed by the player base(it got twice as many votes against as for), and the lag fixes around the time of qr(which i think everybody was thoroughly grateful for), i can't really think of any. you're right that qr was a fix-the-old expansion, but it was about the only one. also, i think most of the flak it got for that was because they promised an industrial expansion and all the industrialists felt let down by the last minute swap in focus, not because people minded the lack of features per se. 1) on the surface, i agree, it looks minor. that said, go find people who play a game that has it(most notably, wow), and ask them what they think of it, and it won't sound minor at all. to hear my wow-playing friends talk, anyone who doesn't have at least 20 mods installed just isn't trying, and the lack of them makes them a worse player. it means ccp never needs to touch the ui again, and every player gets to play with the perfect interface, compared to the garbage we have now. 2) i know, and i approve, but the csm brought it up close to a year ago, and the mechanic has been fundamentally the same(capture the flag with industrial stations) ever since sov was brought in way back in 2005. yes, it's a big change, and yes it takes a while, but my point is that if it was higher on the priority list, we'd be a lot closer to having it done than we seem to be. you're right, i can't say outright that it won't come with a whole package of new features, but most of the proposals i've heard wouldn't qualify - stargate control, a military-specific pos, these things really aren't anything you'd stick on a box to advertise the game.lowsec improvements are only unimportant to people who would never go to lowsec anyways. seriously, have you looked at lowsec ores? the single worst ore in the game is lowsec-only, and all three of the lowsec ores are worth significantly less than stuff you can find trivially in highsec. level 5 missions are, to my understanding, another half-implemented waste of time that very few people bother with. ratting got a boost recently, which i approve of, and the existence of copying and me lines helps things too, but there's still very little to draw people there other than pirates wanting to fight each other. that's not good for the game. yes, of course i realize that. this is why i'm not saying ""fix these, and do everything else you were going to do, and i want a pony!"". i'm talking about a reprioritization here, with a full understanding that that means i have to give some things up - in this case, the rate of addition of new features. and nobody ever said any of this should be done tomorrow. i am not a moron, i understand that it takes time, and that a company like ccp can't turn on a dime. i'm not asking for it all to be patched in over downtime tonight. i am, however, asking for a broad shift in focus that will, over the long term, increase the amount of old features which get reviewed and improved, at the cost of the rate of addition of new features. please don't insult my intelligence, and try to keep to attacking my position on its actual merits and demerits."
3/24/2009,"ya they do need to be nerfed.ya they do need to be buffed.-i just barely missed killing a redeemer. he jumped into our bubble camp, unscouted and everything. unfortunately i was dropping off tasty lewt at the time.these are sort of minor tbh.they just did this? was in old man star and saw a bs ratspawn so...i'm absolutely certain there's veldspar in the belts.sounds like you're the problem here. you can get a massive pve or 10/10 plex passive tank. or you can go gank. where's the shortage? you expect to have a massive tank and gank? hah. gallente command ships lawls at you; as you know they are completely incapable of doing both."
3/24/2009,"i've got two suggestions tied to eachother;* remove csm altogether* relocate those resources spent on csm to customer relation (advisor, like companies uses a press contact that instruct/communicate with customers/press).the reasons;ccp have through the years a multitude of examples where their contacts with customers, other companies, and press, gone wrong. i'll illustrate a few more famous ones;1) t20 - the case of a biased gm isn't remarkable in itself, it's known in several older mmo's that this happens. what's remarkable is ccp's treatment of this situation. the player who found this out was permabanned, while the gm involved got to stay at work. no need to comment more than that, it's quite obvious how this looks in the eyes of the general public.please note i merely point out ccp's flawed behaviour here, no comment regarding the alliance involved.2) ghost training changes - it was just executed without notice. quite a severe affect on the game as a whole, and multiple examples of ccp mistakes. including one where their game info describe this is as a 'feature', and during the player uproar, this is changed without a word.please note i merely point out ccp's flawed behaviour here, no comment on the changes itself if it was good/bad.3) boxed game - eve boxed game was released with the information that you would get a gtc and a ""special edition ship included"". turns out you need to activate the gtc with a fresh new (non-buddy invited) account to get the ship, for one. and the gtc on a new account makes it pretty redundant as well. today you can do a buddy invite and get a 21 day trial + 30 day credit on your account, i.e. effectively 7 weeks alt for free. the gtc in the box gives a 8 weeks character for the fee of the box. so effectively the promised items on the box isn't delivered, or at least not specificed for what it really is.please note - i'm extremely biased in this question as i bought the box for vanity reasons a) own box, b) own ship, c) use gtc on existing account.4) kenzoku goes bob reloaded - this is just another example.. if we look at it from a neutral standpoint, the instant-removal of an alliance is (understatement) quite a major blow. having their alliance name is a major insult and another big blow. but still, there's game rules that clearly state that name changes doesn't happen unless it violate rules. in this case, ccp does exactly the same as with the ghost training. ""oops, we don't know our own rules.. eh, it was a typo in the description?"".please note - once again, this is ccp's mistake, not bob/ken/bobr. i merely point out ccp's flawed behaviour in this case.5) csm - it is the followup of the t20 incident. we players were promised an ""internal affairs group"" of players that would investigate so nothing fishy is going on at ccp. well today it functions as a pr campaign from ccp to divert player attention to csm, from ccp. ""oh crap, players are unhappy.. uhm, talk to csm, they'll bring it up at a meeting and we can discuss it"". no transparency, that was promised.please note - i merely point out ccp's flawed behaviour in this case, no personal opinion about current/previous/future csm candidates. hell i even respect this and make this post in the fashion ccp ""re-invited"" csm to."
3/24/2009,"so..?i could go on, but let's stop here, you're bored of this post, i am bored of ccp not learning to communicate with players. the simple solution would be to just remove csm as they are costing real life money for little payout. what ccp badly needs is someone that can teach them how to communicate with customers. this is the vital key issue.there's nothing wrong with this game, it's arguably the best mmo on market. the playerbase is awsome, and many gm's are helpful and do a good job as well (personal experience, might be flawed, but i like 'em).just put the money to better use. hire someone to teach ccp communicate."
3/24/2009,"i agree.i don't think anybody will disagree that goonswarm's spy games was kind of a cheap shot on bob, but you know what? it was a cheap shot within the rules.i think ccp just demonstrated a disturbing lack of judgment if they think they can bend the rules for bob again without outcry.i didn't have much faith in the csm to begin with but now its patently obvious that they can't even fulfill their primary purpose, which was to be a watchdog for developer misconduct."
3/24/2009,"thanks.i am trying to keep this off the discussions regarding these issues, those discussions are better held elsewhere. nice to see you read all points."
3/24/2009,"wrong. t20 was never a gm as far as i'm aware. she spawned bpo's, sure. but your argument is fundamentally wrong.you are totally ignoring evidence which was put forward by ccp on the issue.i'm sorry. what exactly does the box promise?you are making assumptions based on things you have no clue about. wait till a public statement is made about it. you are also ignoring simple facts here, like the fact that a gm can change a name on his own discretion. mind you the gm team is always being watched by internal affairs. so even if it is abused, it will be found out.wrong. the nyt article was flawed. this has been addressed over and over again. go and read the official csm white-paper about the role of the csm.your arguments are flawed and biased. you don't state fact as much as you state things entirely out of context and often with totally wrong details."
3/24/2009,"i agree with you on the rest of it, but what are you really saying here? corruption is bad when a gm does it, but dev corruption is fine? i'm fairly strident about how bad some parts of this game are, but really, the 1980s-era mail client reflects far less badly on ccp than the fact that t20 wasn't ridden out of town on a rail, not to mention the ********** ban. aside from getting the job description wrong, op is exactly right about this incident. i disagree with his solution, of course, but it's still a problem."
3/24/2009,"too bad they didnt include a tinfoil hat in the box, as thats what you really need after reading the forums."
3/24/2009,"the point that the op made was solely about misconduct by a customer support agent. note ""the case of a biased gm isn't remarkable in itself, it's known in several older mmo's that this happens"". he makes the connection that other games have had biased gms. because there was not talk about a gm here, it's flawed.i agree that it's just as bad. i'm merely pointing out flawed argumentation."
3/24/2009,"well vista, what good has the csm accomplished?i'm perfectly willing to accept the csm if you can prove that ccp has done anything based on the csm's wishes.the ny times article may have been misinterpreted or whatever, but that doesn't change that the original catalyst that resulted in the csm's formation was the t20 incident. ccp said they wanted more player oversight over their actions. how is the csm anything other than a useless figurehead, if ccp is still allowed to bend rules whenever they want without consulting the csm at all?where's the transparency we were promised? gm grimmi's statement didn't explain anything and didn't clarify the rules whatsoever. it didn't explain which circumstances allow you to petition for a name change. it didn't explain why the new alliance name is longer than allowed for anyone else. it didn't explain why kenzoku deserved a name change. ccp designed the game with safeguards built in so that you can't just disband an alliance. bob chose to remove those safeguards to operate more efficiently, leaving themselves vulnerable. why do they get sympathy? what happened to them was fair under the rules and the solution they got from it wasn't. end of story."
3/24/2009,"lets see:1. orca2. weapon stacking3. skill queue4. plex system as a response to the uproar about 30-day gtcs being taken out5. the possiblity of a 0.0 overhaul(see the csm minutes)6. assembly arrays getting a boost7. suicide ganking balancing8. module cycle timer.ad there's more stuff in the pipeline i'm sure. the problem with interacting with a company is that, despite using agile methods, that it's not all the agile. they work on 4 month-schedules, which means that csm2 won't see the fruit of it's labour till maybe even csm4 takes office. so the fact we had so many features already implemented into the game is really excellent, imo. a catalyst just makes things go faster. however that's quite different from causality. i agree entirely that the t20 incident made the leadership of ccp realize that xhagen's idea for a csm was really good.i think you are speculating a bit too much. i have no idea how much i can say due to my nda. however just trust me when i say that you are making a wrong assumption. i agree with you entirely. i'm not very pleased with the statement either. exactly. the csms stance is also quite clear on this. nothing warranted that the name should have been changed."
3/24/2009,and we'd give this up times x100 if there could be no more dev sponsored cheating in this game!
3/24/2009,"gee, trolling conspiracy nutcase on the left, csm staff with what power they have on the right, who will i trust more?i do not give support to trolls and stupid tinfoil hat wearers. they should be clubbed down like badgers with a hammer."
3/24/2009,i don't like stupid people with their stupid replies either.
3/24/2009,"well at least i don't see useless conspiracies where there are none, and i don't waste valuable csm time with asinine proposals that serve my delusional agenda."
3/24/2009,"the problem with this stuff is, these are features that could have just as easily been proposed via the features and ideas forum or just internally within ccp.i'm not trying to be difficult, but while the csm might give a pretty voice to ideas, those ideas were definitely already being heard without the csm. i don't think a good idea with a lot of merit behind it needs csm support to get noticed. black ops are a good example of this. everyone knows black ops need a boost, and there are tons of threads about it. does the issue require csm support before it'll get addressed? did anything change when the csm brought it up? not really.the proposals for a cargo ship between haulers and freighters was around for a long time before the csm brought it to the devs. was the csm really the reason the orca entered the game?when i asked for meaningful issues the csm has addressed, i think i meant something more along the lines of issues that are outside the game.when the reactor bug was discovered and ccp jumped all over it and then released a long, detailed explanation of what happened and the steps taken to fix it... that is what i wanted. but then i see stuff like the bob name change happening and it just reinforces the feeling i have that ccp only pays the csm lip service when it's in their interest to do so.the csm needs to have the power to cause problems at ccp. until the csm's decisionmaking can negatively affect ccp, it doesn't have any real power. it might sound counterproductive to attack the company we all know and love, but without any true ability to affect things the csm is all bark and no bite... and will never be a real factor in decisions.because this is just a virtual world in a videogame owned by a private company, this will of course never happen... nor do i think it should, really. but pretending to have an ""oversight panel"" to review company decisions is just silly.making you guys sign an nda violates the entire principle behind having an oversight group in the first place."
3/24/2009,first every goon/bob and there mother comes out of the woodwork to yell for csm approval.now we got a thread screaming to tear down csm and treating it like csm are being paid to listen to this crap let alone getting resources.this is utter hilarity.
3/24/2009,"and you should seek therapy, if you think hitting people and defenceless animals with a hammer is ok"
3/24/2009,... aren't badgers actually really dangerous in real life?i thought they were one of those animals that you don't want to mess with but you'd never know it by looking at them. kind of like hippos
3/24/2009,"thing is, they weren't. a queue has been proposed since the game was in beta, and nothing came of it until after the csm brought it up. weapon grouping was brought up int he context of ""reload all with (type)"", which is another feature requested since the dawn of time. again, nothing happened for five years, and it's in within a couple months of the csm bringing it up that it goes live. yeah, it could be a coincidence, but i wouldn't bet on it. i think that ccp places a lot more weight on the csm's opinion than it does on random forum opinions. a forum whiner represents themselves, the nine members of the csm represent something like 10000 people. they speak with far more weight than even the most eloquent, well-considered, apropos suggestion on the forums ever could, because they speak for more people than themselves. this is doubly true of issues that have a loud group on both sides, like the nano nerf - you can't sort out what the players think by looking at f+i debates, but you can sort it out by asking them to support people who think like them and then getting those representatives to speak on the topic. also, the face-to-face nature of it helps a lot, too."
3/24/2009,"here is the problem: ccp doesn't prioritize things as well as the players. all the features mentioned were already suggested. and most of them were in the pipeline. if it wasn't for the csm, it could have taken ages for these important things to make it into the game. by representing what the players would prefer to see in the next x expansions. that we ccp have people with a different perspective to discuss with and do things better. tell that to the people who has been begging for an orca for ages. the csm got on the case and it was implemented just a few months later.well, i'm under nda. but i got the impression last summer in iceland that ccp didn't really see any problems with black ops. the fact it hasn't been addressed, there is good reasons for. mostly time. if ccp had the resources, i'm certain they would have been buffed more than they have. mind you that they did address 1 thing about black-ops which we talked about: the fact that you can't bring a hauler with you for fuel/loot. that was addressed.if the csm hadn't brought it up, who knows how long it would have taken.as far as i'm aware, we can go to the media just fine."
3/24/2009,this is why i voted for you. thank you for existing.
3/24/2009,the csm is and always will be a joke. a poor one... and lavista attempts of spining the facts to save his cheese are obnoxious.
3/24/2009,"what an astounding logical argument that was. i guess sophistry still exists, even in this day and age."
3/24/2009,"so how exactly am i spinning facts? unless you substantiate your view, it's worth nothing."
3/24/2009,anyone can argue logic... whether they are doing so with actual rationality as opposed to a 3 year old with finger paint is a different matter.
3/24/2009,"i'm going to disagree a bit on the details. i look at that list and in all that i at best the csm might have had a small effect on the order that ccp addressed those issues. that said i don't believe that reduces the value of the csm. the csm can really only ever expect to do a couple of things:1. provide independent oversight of ccp when issues like the t20 and pos exploit occur. i think the csm has done a good job making sure that the pilots of eve hear the full details when there looks to be the possibility of ccp misconduct.2. escalate major issues that the community is experiencing. i am less convinced that the csm is any better than the forums and other community resources can be.3. provide feedback about long term directions ccp should consider as they map out new features in eve. i think this is something the csm can do better than the players at large because the csm is willing to sign an nda and the discussions can be more open. the csm will never be a the way to get your favorite idea into eve. there are a bunch of reasons for this:1. ccp can read your ideas in the forums just as well as the csm can. in fact in many cases that is the only way theu will see them as at this point a csm member has to like your idea enough to bring it up in a meeting and it could be voted down there.2. ccp is working full time already on all sorts of new stuff in eve. it can take years for something new to make it into eve. there are often all sorts of issues that make what seems like a good idea at first not be so good in the end. someone outside ccp can never see the whole picture. your good idea if it could be in the game todaqy could be a terrible thing in the eve that is in place 2 years from now and you might not understand why till you see something they are alreaqdy doing.3. ccp has a much bigger picture to consider when they decide what makes it into the 'verse. they have to consider how it aligns with thier long term vision, they have to look at the technical issues, they have to look at the business issues, they have to weigh all the good ideas against each other because there are only so many things they can do.4. there is a reason not everyone designs games for a living, it is hard to get right and not that many people are any good at it. so a lot of times the player generated ideas just aren't as good as something a person that has done it all their life might have come up with. also, no one outside ccp has the creative enviroment that the ccp lives in. they have direct interactions with writers, artist, other designers and they get to do it full time. that's not to say players don't have great ideas, sometimes they do, but not every player generated idea is a flash of genius.so if you want your idea to have a shot you need to ""own"" it. spend time on your proposal. provide enough detail so that it can truly be understood. share it with the community. expect it to be ripped apart. use that feedback and refine it. and if you really have a passion for it keep it on the radar. (cont)"
3/24/2009,"ok, lets do a brief analyzis of your arguments in this thread:1) someone brings the t20 incident and says that ccp handled poorly a gm abuse of power. your argument: ""t20 was nto a gm so your point is invalid."". yes t20 was not a gm, he was a dev, which makes the guy's argument even more valid if such a thing is even possible. the fact that he was mistaken about the post is completely irrelevant to the point he was trying to make. as you had nothing to say about the mishandling itself that could redeem ccp, you just decided to try and derange the argument into a discussion about a worker position. 2) ""you are totally ignoring evidence which was put forward by ccp on the issue."" no evidence was given whatsover, none that could be verified. unverifiable evidence is null and void. ccp's politics of obfuscation are widely known and you are not naive enough to believe in them, you are just on the other side.3) ""you are making assumptions based on things you have no clue about. wait till a public statement is made about it. you are also ignoring simple facts here, like the fact that a gm can change a name on his own discretion. mind you the gm team is always being watched by internal affairs. so even if it is abused, it will be found out."" in the past ccp has never ever punished an employee for anythind or admited wrong doing and gone back in a poor decision made. they are just that arrogant. your poor attempt of quenching the outrage is noted, but again, based on absurdities.4) ""wrong. the nyt article was flawed. this has been addressed over and over again. go and read the official csm white-paper about the role of the csm."" - the csm objective is to serve as a free pr department for ccp and allow them to do whatever pleases them whist keeping the appearance of listening to the players. it is a joke and serves only for this purposes and the purpose of feeding the naive egos of reality withdrawn people like you. it never served or will serve any interest of the community in any significant way. you can try and attribute anything you want to csm existence, but the reality is anything that has been done with it would hvae been done without it just as well and as fast. you are just a bunch of useless brats, playing politics."
3/24/2009,"(cont)as to this recent issue with the name change. the csm was certainly never included in any discussion about changing the name of the former and now again sort of a bob alliance. i don't think any of the current csm would have supported the idea (in fact i think we would have all complained pretty vigourously, but i'll let the rest of the csm speak to their reaction).i think you need to give the csm some time to dig into this as this is exactly the sort of oversight i think the csm can do best. i hope the csm will demand a full explanation to the community at large. personally i hope the csm can help get the decision reversed. again, that's just me.so summary, the csm can be a group that can ""try"" to keep ccp ""honest"". i don't believe the csm is the best mechanism to drive new features into eve in the short term. i do believe the csm can use their access to ccp in their nda discussions to help steer the long term direction of eve to match the players the csm choose to represent. this oversight and the possibility of affecting the long term direction of eve is why players should support the csm process, find a candidate that seems to think like they do about eve and help get them elected.issler"

3/24/2009,"i can't understand why they would do this if it is against their own rules as it opens the door for other players/corps/alliances to do the same thing & really ccp not allowing others to do it now will only fan the flames of this fire.is there a place where ccp have this rule(?) written where us players are able to have a read of it?to say i am disappointed with this is an understatement & if something that is as noticeable as this is being done & there is rules to say it isn't done for anybody, then what else is being done for them that isn't as easy for outsiders to notice?"
3/24/2009,double standards
3/24/2009,disband them.thats favoritism.must we all be reminded of the t20 incident?
3/24/2009,1
3/24/2009,wow it does remind me of the t20 thing or whatever it was.stop the favoritism!
3/24/2009,do it!
3/24/2009,disband thier alliance or else i will have a serious quarrel with some devs when i get to speak face to face.support!
3/24/2009,"i'll take my char rename now, something that starts with m please."
3/24/2009,/signedstop the favoritism...
3/24/2009,"haha, you guys are pathetic... always a good laugh seeing people whine.if bob self destructed a 1bil carrier would that make you happy :) ? else i cant really see whats the problem, did it ruin your kb stats or something lol :=)keep up dramaing, its great entertainmentedit: if you think this vote will go through you are either optimistic or directly stupid."
3/24/2009,wooooooooosh~
3/24/2009,supporting this
3/24/2009,m. corp xd
3/24/2009,"not supported.this was a renaming of an existing alliance; at worst the alliance should be simply renamed back, but not disbanded completely.also, it's hilarious to note where many of the votes in support of this proposal are coming from. keep on hating, guys./ben"
3/24/2009,"i dont speak for my corporation nor my alliance, stop making that mistake aswell :)"
3/24/2009,bunch of damned drama queens.
3/24/2009,indeed
3/24/2009,"tut tut, you can't deny it's a little inconsistent. ethereal dawn not that long ago had their name stolen and assumed the alliance name black rise. later the thieves relinquished the name and ed were able to re assume it. the important difference being..... ye you guessed it they lost sov to do it"
3/24/2009,votes are votes and this issue will make it to council.
3/24/2009,we are watching
3/24/2009,is it me or are there alot of goon posts in this thread
3/24/2009,"this is a balls out inconsistency to say the least..i really don't get involved with all this crap usually.. but time after time ccp seems to make them same ****-ups, it really should stop.as has been said before, consistency is the key to credibility in this industry."
3/24/2009,"so if a brand of toilet paper renames it self, why whould the competetor demand the name to be set back or disband the company.stop winging goon's and deal with it.bob is reloaded deal with it!"
3/24/2009,bob is toilet paper?
3/24/2009,how can this be a legit vote if you cant even vote no <_<
3/24/2009,unfair
3/24/2009,"whether intended or not, it looks like favouritism."
3/24/2009,is it me or did your alliance gets its name changed in violation of ccp's own rules?
3/24/2009,this is pretty much the biggest bull**** ever.
3/24/2009,"you know, you're right - toilet paper is an excellent metaphor for bobzoku ii: electric boogaloo."
3/24/2009,siding wit goon here
3/24/2009,former bob come kenzuki come bob reloaded and allowed to rename their alliance from ffp (fail failure productions) is total utter *******s!
3/24/2009,disband them once and for all
3/24/2009,heh mate i just work here nothing to do with me/me whistles
3/24/2009,"i think what was done was incorrect. if they wanted a new alliance name, they should have had to use game mechanics to get one like anyone else and deal with whatever consequences arise from such a choice.what was done circumvents the game as it is presented."
3/24/2009,wow awesome tell you what make a proposal to disband every space holding entity in the game and i will agree with you ok?also i believe if you think it is a dev misconduct then you want to go to internalaffairs@ccpgames.com and make a complaint there... or maybe i dunno rage quit some more?
3/24/2009,waiting for initial response from ccp before raising the issue for next csm meeting.
3/24/2009,"there are rules in place about this. the rename was outside of said rules. if they want to be bob reloaded so bad, they should drop sov and put down a bil like everyone else has to. it's not that hard a concept to grasp. i personally like the new name better, anime jokes were getting stale, i could have a lot of fun with the beaver gimmick. if tau ceti federation suddenly turned into the french connection, i'd petition it just the same. the rules are in place for a reason, the devs are meant to be a neutral body. there shouldn't be any discussion on this."
3/24/2009,"doh stoopidand then they form under a different alliance name with the same corps, ergo they are the same but with a different name.let me see when that has happened before....."
3/24/2009,"supported. if i can't rename my corp, my alts, or my main, then no one should be able to do so.why ccp, why?"
3/24/2009,wtf gm's?
3/24/2009,"why so serious guys, ahahaha.maybe if i put 25 thumbs up using all my alts it'll change.cry me a river"
3/24/2009,"lol @ all of you that think this is just about the alliance name changing. no one would have had any problem with their name change if they had formed a new alliance to obtain it, just like everyone else has to do. instead they got a new name without the penalties (mainly sov loss) that come with it."
3/24/2009,signed
3/24/2009,"can anyone else do it?i really dont understand why people can't see that the foundation of the game is fair play. goons' original metagaming to steal the bob name may have been stupid and against ccp's intent, but anyone could do it to anyone. it's dumb, but fair.this 'correction', if that's how ccp wants to paint it, isn't fair. it's favoritism and it's a big deal. what other bonuses do they get that we can't see so publicly? ccp has spent years developing the csm and trying to rebrand themselves as a transparent company that values fairness. this is undoing a lot of their effort and it illuminates how stupid the csm really is."
3/24/2009,"vuk baby vukky babe vuuuky baby jt just called me again and sang the sweetest melodyi wrote the lyrics down in marker pen on my arm coz i have no toilet paper.he said ""cry me a river"" dont know what he meant,maybe that means something to you /me shrugs"
3/24/2009,"this band of brothers reloaded is too close to the band of brothers corp. they should not have had their name changed. why don't neo, trinity, and morpheus turn back into cartoons."

3/24/2009,i agree and support this.
3/24/2009,forgive my wild ignorance on the subject but didn't bob die out not too long ago?
3/24/2009,"dear ccp. to be honest i think you should just rename the alliance ""band of dev's"" instead.you have always denied that you favour bobr/kenzoku/bob over other alliances. what are we all supposed to think now?"
3/24/2009,"no we are re-loaded, like back to the future2 or ghostbusters 2 or other sequels that were really cool, honest"

3/24/2009,"they also have the only alliance ticker with a lower case letter. no other alliance can do that via normal game mechanics. of course, normal game mechanics don't seem to be a concern for some players."
3/24/2009,"oh please, get a life. although i think bob should pay ccp 1billion isk, this is not game breaking. it was because of you jerks that they had to do this in the first place. get over it. ccp did it, it is their game. not yours. --isaac"
3/24/2009,"in follow up from my support which is lost in this thread somewhere i must say this saddens me greatly. i have many a friend interested in mmos and i would love to be able to show them the joys of eve but time and time again i get told ""but if the devs favour a specific group, whats the point?"" they rightly ask.my reply is that it's rare and should never happen again. sadly you have proven me wrong.you guy have made a work of art in eve. you allow scams, you have a player diven economy and the pollitical landscape is decided by players. now, there is no way i would say that the person who have made this great game should not enjoy it themselves, imo thats just silly to suggest that. however it is obvious that some people in power have a vested interest in a specific group.i love eve but why allow people in your company to damage the reputation of such a great game? why risk players over such a simple thing as a name change?"
3/24/2009,"in the light of ccps conduct in the past - ccp needs to be interrogated over thisthe members of staff involved in the name change traced - and their actions auditedthe methods used by ex bob to contact these members of staff identified (to assure correct channel were used)as such im giving this my nominal support - although it is possible ccp acted in good faiththis really is why the csm was initial mooted (before it got watered down) - to check ""in every nook and cranny"" to ensure ccp staff are acting professionaly. i hope the csm members will not be bribed with free posters and bum bags and block out the false ""we r all mates here *insert beer joke/hangover quip"" from ccp and aggressively pursue this issue until the truth is discovered.skunk"
3/24/2009,oh and btw: there is no rule that doesn't allow the renaming of an alliance. show me the proof if there is this supposed rule. --isaac
3/24/2009,"two things.first of all, i understand that bob would normally need to pay the 1b and lose all sov to do this, which is the reason for this outcry (well that's debatable, but that's the front used at the very least). they probably asked to have the name changed, most likely expecting nothing to happen, but it did. why is this something bob should be punished for? i don't understand why you would punish the person requesting this, in the same way i wouldn't understand punishing someone requesting a new ship because a bug caused them to lose their original ship.the fault quite clearly lies with ccp, for allowing something they perhaps shouldn't have. the fault does not lie with bob for asking if this is something ccp will consider. imagine you're still young and living with your parents, if you asked them if you could stay out late for one night, instead you get grounded for even asking if you could stay late, wouldn't you find that to be pretty unfair? to me this is the same kind of story, they asked, there's nothing wrong with asking this, it is a fairly reasonable request given the circumstances. one that maybe should not have been granted, but certainly not outrageous to ask. they did not force ccp to make this decision, nobody held a gun to their head (to my knowledge :p).secondly, i'm not sure how massive of a rule violation this really is. i understand rules need to be followed, and i'm pretty strict on that personally, i cannot stand hypocrisy or dual standards for those things. however, i also have to acknowledge that it's impossible to write a rule to deal with every possible situation. i doubt that when they decided that no alliance shall be renamed unless it violates the naming policy, they considered a highly unlikely situation of a disband like this, with the name being claimed by another alliance, and everything that lead up to this whole ordeal. if there is no precedent for them denying previous alliances to which this happened (i honestly don't know if there's not), then i don't think it's entirely unreasonable to decide that this should be an exception to the rules, because of the circumstances (which are, quite frankly, far from ordinary or common).of course the most obvious flaw there is that other alliances might ""fake"" a disband like this just to get a name of their choosing (although bob did, at one point, pay for kenzoku, and they did lose all their sov not too long ago). my point is simply that this is an extraordinary situation, and that the rules probably weren't written with a situation like this in mind."
3/24/2009,why does ccp continuously go above and beyond for bob? this is outside of the boundaries for which ccp has even stated they would/wouldn't intervene....just more proof of who gets the preferencial treatment from the developers/csm's.....and to think that we actually pay to play.
3/24/2009,freak out much? this is ridiculous. its an internet spaceship game. not real life. get over yourself. --isaac
3/24/2009,"-alliance name > character limit-sov maintained-bob was disbanded because the executor corp was setup to allow itccp should: revert name / disband / remove sov & charge 1b isk, and reprimand whichever employees decided this was a good idea."
3/24/2009,a bit of transparency here would be welcome.
3/24/2009,"you dont know what you are talking about, they lost their alliance due to espionage...which has been a favored tactic by bob themselves. and everything they have done to other alliances has been ""outside of ccp's involvement and within the rules"" but yet it gets done to them and all is reversed...that's bs!!"
3/24/2009,look how dumb you are~ source
3/24/2009,"check sirmolle ingame, its been renamed back to kenny."
3/24/2009,"there isn't, but to rename your alliance you have to disband it and start a new one. therefore you must pay the fees and lose sov over whatever systems you have, something bob didn't have to do."
3/24/2009,"thank you for your comments.i refer you to the quote from the new york times - from hilmar peterson - ccp chief executiveit is indeed internet spaceships, but its internet spaceships with a player council originally designed to deal with ccp corruption. indeed, a member of staff is employed by ccp solely to ensure this is the case.the op has suggested the decisions made were not professional - and he has a great deal of support. as such i believe my post and support for the op was in order.skunk"
3/24/2009,"this is an excellent post...i wonder if all those gaming magazines and credited critics that gave great reviews would still consider this the high profile player driven game that they think it is, if they knew that ccp gives preferencial treatment to a specific alliance and has done so many times. ccp why dont you consider the game to move along the way it should move by letting bob deal with the same crap they have dealt out and not giving them the upper hand by having you to fall back on?"
3/24/2009,i seriously wonder if anyone besides bob has asked ccp to change their alliance name....makes you wonder.--isaac
3/24/2009,"ccp really needs to stop this favoritism. despite their lack of transparency, it is obvious that the devs at the very least bend -- if not break -- the rules whenever they think they can get away with it. the whole mention of the ""bat phone"" in the leaked irc chats posted after bob was disbanded pretty much solidifies the accusation of dev assistance to bob... (not that more evidence was really needed from past blunders.)this latest act by ccp puts another bad mark on a wonderful game. i haven't read the article yet about eve being one of the top 5 most important mmos... but i hope it is amended to show how dev collusion with the player base is rampant in the game and should be unacceptable in this environment. to clear this up, ccp needs to correct the mistake (ie. disband bobr) and let them create a new alliance under the proper terms. they also need to discipline the employees responsible for basically giving the finger to the rest of the player base. i suggest locking them in a room stuck listening to bjork's full catalog and see who eats who first. those left alive will then be forced to play wow."

3/24/2009,"i don't care if it's kenzoku, bob, goons, cva, ra or even the mgrl, one set of rules should apply to everybody.another example of apparent favoritism....remember this:please visit your user settings to re-enable images. looks like the 'special' line still exists.i feel a full investigation by ia is required for this matter."
3/24/2009,there is no guarantee that the name will be changed. only character names that are deemed as inappropriate are eligible for a possible name change. names will not be changed for any other reason.remember this you have violated your own term and conditions.
3/24/2009,"ccp can disband every alliance in eve, make bob the sole ruler of 0.0, and they will still deny favoritism."
3/24/2009,"the only thing more dumb then ccp allowing this is all the idiots defending bob for getting special treatment yet again. delve is ours already so none of this really matters. however if they had to follow the rules like everyone else; do you really bob would have closed the alliance to rename it while dropping sov in the last systems they have, yea right... you're a moron.ccp needs to explain why only bob is allowed to circumvent loss of sov due to a name change."
3/24/2009,please apply your own rules ccp.
3/24/2009,"i fully support ccp undoing any mistake that shows favoritism, and failure to uphold their own rules. however, the op is suggesting that an alliance be disbanded because of a mistake on ccp's part. this is unnecessary, heavy handed and malicious in nature. /unsigned. i will gladly /sign a thread which seeks to undo the name change, and which seeks to have internal affairs thoroughly investigate the matter.seriously folks, think rationally. don't let emotions and biases cloud your judgement."

3/24/2009,"you've got it all wrong people. ccp is doing name changes now, i'm petitioning for mine immediately! join the party!"
3/24/2009,"if they currently have the ability to make ccp break the rules in their favor, as you seem to suggest, why in the world wouldn't they have used this very same ability to have bob and sov 3 restored a month ago?"
3/24/2009,"want more people to play? a good starting point would be to stop giving bob out of game help. first the blueprints and now this. come on! people aren't paying for ccp to give free bonuses to another alliance. either stop doing it or make the game free, because it's not fair to the other players."
3/24/2009,/signedyou make me want to quit ccp
3/24/2009,"ccp we need some kind of official statement here. for the second time that has been recorded the alliance formerly known as the band of brothers has recieved treatment that is outside the precidents of the game. this is beginning to look very bad and brings into question the credability of the company to keep it's employees from bring any kind of special treatment to where they want to play.while i do not support the disbanding of the alliance i do feel that the alliance should be put back to it's old name. additionally it is time this matter has a swift and proper justice with devs that participated in this special treatment either being banned from the game or outright fired from the company.ccp you have promised up that the past was examined and now everything is above board, it is time to back up your previous position."
3/24/2009,because that would've caused even more of a ****storm than t20 and any other noteworthy event in eve history combined?
3/24/2009,"yeah this ccp / bob nepotism has to end. every time you do something this stupid, favoring the most hated alliance in eve, you make me want to play less."
3/24/2009,"how so? mistakes can be made more than once can they not? the only reason why people want bob 2.0 disbanded is because they have stereotyped the entire alliance as cheaters, and automatically assume that bob cheated to get this done. people are jumping to conclusions here. the only appropriate actions at this time are to get internal affairs to investigate, and to undo the name change.if internal affairs uncovers player misconduct, then the players responsible for said misconduct should be appropriately punished. if they discover that this is the result of gm misconduct, then the gm responsible should be punished. asking an entire alliance to be disbanded because of a single player's crimes is irresponsible and unethical. just like it would be unethical for ccp to disband goonswarm because of a single player's misconduct.the only time where it would be ethical for ccp to forcibly disband an alliance would be if they could show that the alliance as a whole was guilty of misconduct."
3/24/2009,"anything the goons disagree with causes a ****storm, nothing new there.if they're bob's pets as much as people like to portray, and put a spin on things just to accommodate bob, all they'd have to say is the director account was hacked. in a situation like that reversing the damage done wouldn't be completely out of the ordinary, and the account hacked vs someone turned traitor is very much a he said she said thing, except one of the parties is supposedly unbiased and has all the information, while the other party is biased and basing it all on the word of a single person."
3/24/2009,"i see two options here. either ccp gives a free alliance name change to every alliance exactly the same way kenny got it, or the new kenny gets disbanded again losing all their sov.i think ""goonswarm 2 revenge of z0r"" this is 26 characters and beyond the normal rules but if bob gets to go over the limit i think it would be fair to extend this courtesy to us as well."

3/24/2009,way to keep the playing field level ccp. way to keep things fair and even and you know. a player run game is a player run game. even my friends who never play eve have heard ****ty things about the game because of the past dev/gm/etc scandals. let's not make it worse.
3/24/2009,"there is only one fair solution to your unfair post, deleting every single character on that account you posted with, and every account associated with it.why? hell i don't know, because you deserve to be punished for something you didn't do, hold on i'll start the proposal."

3/24/2009,"a quote from eve eula regarding rules and policies. so i request a gm to comment.3. violationsa. if a name is deemed inappropriate, gms may be able to change the characters name in some circumstances. this is solely at the discretion of ccp and/or its representatives based on, but not limited to, account and player history and the severity of the violation. there is no guarantee that the name will be changed. only character names that are deemed as inappropriate are eligible for a possible name change. names will not be changed for any other reason. what i have bolded also includes alliance names, kenzoku is not an offensive or abusive name. so may i request why it was changed. this means that ccp have the right to change it, however it also means that they have to give a valid reason as to why it should be changed. abusive or inappropriate names would be changed.in order to change your alliance name, you need to remake a new alliance, this decision to change there name has no grounds and it should be raised through ccp internal affairs as would request an investigation. i would also request that csa would take up this issue when they conveen with ccp. csa speak for the player base of the eve community. so their word does count."
3/24/2009,"so the csm is not a platform to discuss transparency and allegations of dev misconduct?you heard if the from the .bob. guy, might as well close this thread, he's already asked his buddies to ignore it."
3/24/2009,"sorry, why is your name the same as a x goon corp?however if you were on the other side where ccp changed your name to an alliance which no longer exists and it is against eula."
3/24/2009,"what really amazed me was that they not only showed preferential treatment by changing the name, but they allowed a 25 character name when the limit is 24 characters. they should be band of brothers reloade"

3/24/2009,"ccp has tried to cover up the t20 incident for years now, so this is hardly a surprise."
3/24/2009,"just wow....i think this needs to be looked at, sent a email to internalaffairs@ccpgames.com about this. but this is pretty just wow and tearing open an old wound..."
3/24/2009,"i have to wonder why the bob allies are rushing to defend them so quickly, have you not stopped to ask:if my alliance wanted to change its name to more than 24 characters long or at all - why can't i?defenders of bobr are now starting to use the defence this must have been some sort of mistake: did someone type into a field in the database ""band of brothers reloaded"" and pressed the ok button by accident? take a step back and realise that this isn't about bob directly, but you as a customer, shouldn't you as a non bob alliance player regardless of your alignment with them be entitled to the same set of rules and conduct everyone else. simply standing up and saying their bob they did no wrong, if goons didn't disband the original alliance this wouldn't have happend doesn't change the fact that anyone that isn't in bob - the majority of the player base got screwed over, and it wasn't some simple accidental boo boo by a gm/dev etcit may have been a name change to some, and again regardless of your affiliation with their alliance, you got screwed over and you should be angry about it."
3/24/2009,"either change it back, disband them and force them to create a new alliance with the name they want, or allow all alliances the ability to do the same, while exceeding the maximum character limit even."
3/24/2009,supporting this.
3/24/2009,"except in that case, the person known as haargoth would say ""i did it"" and that would really screw up any argument about hacking....hth"
3/24/2009,4realz
3/24/2009,wee taaah dead.
3/24/2009,"why? the person who hacked the account says it isn't a hacked account but the real player doing it, shocker! no matter what you do, you have no way to prove this is really your account and it wasn't hacked or anything of that nature. the people with the most information in that regard are ccp, which also happens to be the unbiased source (or supposed to be).would this be a cluster**** to cover up? well yeah, definitely. but so is giving t2 bpo's to people and hiding it for so long. if this kind of favoritism is supposed to still exist, then this kind of cover-up isn't all that crazy. :p"
3/24/2009,"i hope they never allow that, i can see it in a few months time, kenny/bob will rewrite their version of history and claim now that it can be done they did no wrong, and the issue will get pushed aside as they do with every t20 reference, with the rules left as they are they should never be allowed to get away with this."
3/24/2009,"this has nothing to do with goons disbanding bob. and i apologize if i come across as suggesting that the name change itself was an accident on someone's part. i am simply saying that it was a mistake on ccp's part to allow the name change to happen, and a mistake to not have proper internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening.just because a single gm was guilty of misconduct, does not mean that all of ccp, and all of bob is guilty of the same misconduct. if the crimes of a single person fell upon the alliance that person was a part of, then goonswarm would have had to be disbanded a looonnnngg time ago, as i am more than certain that goonswarm has it's fair share of macrominers, rmt'ers, etc etc...another thing that i should clear up is that i am not trying to defend bob/kenny. while it is true that i have no love for goons, i never liked the way bob presented itself to me when i was but a fledgling noob back in yon days of the pendulum wars. i was rooting for ascn back then, and i was always rather resentful that bob had crushed them.i am also not saying that bob should not be punished if they did in fact cheat as a whole. i am saying that ccp should reserve judgement until after internal affairs investigates the situation. the last thing they should do is start throwing bans around without proof that the bans are warranted."
3/24/2009,"step back for a second, ignore any of the politics involved between goons and ex-bob. okay?so an alliance wants to rename itself. the steps involved and that have been used to this date are disbanding the alliance (mostly just the name) and reforming under a new one. they give up sov claims (even if it's just six) in this time until their new alliance is formed. this has been the case throughout eve.back to names. kenzoku obviously wanted a new name, so they should have disbanded and reformed under their new moniker (although i'm not sure they would be allowed to have an alliance name so close to a non-affiliated corp's name, but that's off a slight tangent.)for whatever reason, kenzoku were allowed to bypass the established process of changing an alliance name, including circumventing all of the negatives associated with such an act. now 1bn isn't much isk of course, even if you don't own r64's anymore, however being allowed to maintain sov is a pretty large bonus that no other alliance changing names has been allowed to have. and of course this will reek of bias given my alliance ticker, but how is disbanding their alliance such a drastic thing when they obviously really wanted this new name (which they said they didn't want before =p) so i would expect they would be willing to pay the appropriate penalties associated with changing the name.unless they were only willing to change kenzoku to bobr if they could avoid the penalties, in which case it is hard to sympathize with them regardless v0v"
3/24/2009,"wow, one group of players getting favourable treatment from the gms/developers over the rest of the playerbase? that surely wouldn't happen in the ""new"" ccp with their internal affairs department that was created as a response to this kind of favouritism causing a huge scandal previously *cough*t20*cough*..oh hai, it's the same group getting the favouritism.something rotten in the state of iceland* (and it's not the rotten shark that they claim is a delicacy either).*apologies to shakespeare."

3/24/2009,"i think the most important thing is consistency, which is why i'm supporting this resolution.i see no honest reason as to why the name was changed, it is not offensive.the renaming of kenzoku smacks of favouritism; i believe that not only ccp needs to be impartial, but that they also need to appear impartial.the renaming makes me believe neither, and i'm very interested as to why it happened."

3/24/2009,"no other alliance has ever had this done for them, so there should be no exceptions.disband the alliance."

3/24/2009,"guk guk look at all of you lame goonies and goonie pets posting. lol you think ccp is that stupid to not see your spamming? you did not beat bob, a former director of bob beat them, you guys were just the pathetic vessle of retribution to a shattered alliance, after the damage was done. so really, you guys are nothing."
3/24/2009,"seems unreasonable to have different rules for different alliance, anyway we all want to see post starting ""oh my god, the killed kenny, you b*stards"""
3/24/2009,definantly not supported.although the whining and headless chicken ambulation is much chucklesome over my morning java.
3/24/2009,for god's sake think of the barbies! but seriously ccp offers to rename characters at a price is this going to be waived from now on.
3/24/2009,"i am annoyed at what appears to be a blatant piece of favouritism by a random gm with bobr connections. i am just plain disappointed by those who put their political alliance ahead of objective evaluation when they say silly things like, ""it's only a name,"" or, ""goons deserve it."" there can be no justification for effectively giving a brand new alliance sov 3 status in multiple systems for free. rule avoidance on this level effectively undermines gm authority and creates more work as petition queues are flooded with everyone demanding the same treatment. this stuff affects us all, no matter how irrelevant 0.0 politics may seem.i have no connection to goons, bobr or their respective allies. as a relative newcomer, i have heard about the ""bad old days"" when developers actively aided their alliance of choice. however, i believed such things to be a relic of the past.here's hoping the player base will get an official answer from ccp at least."
3/24/2009,same rules for all.
3/24/2009,i support this and i also take issue with .bob. parodying our bob ticker. please fix this.
3/24/2009,1
3/24/2009,"get over it!, its just a name and gain no advantage from it!!!!stop wasting csm time with this crap"
3/24/2009,"this:""this is the **** that makes everyone so angry. while goonsawrm used a valid in game mechanic to remove your alliance (broken or not) you got what no one else has ever gotten. two wrongs never make a right and certainly - petition to change the sov mechanic - but you don't deserve special treatment.its not about whats fair - this isnt hello kitty online - its about he rules, and making you play by them."""
3/24/2009,"errr no, alliance name changes have, until now, required disbanding the alliance, paying 1 billion isk to form a new one and losing sov status in the old alliance systems. thus, bobr's name change is the equivalent of not only waiving the alliance creation fee, it also involves effectively giving a brand new alliance sov 3 status in multiple systems for free.*that* is why people are annoyed about it and making a fuss."
3/24/2009,a whole lot of sandy vag's in here
3/24/2009,this should be done immediately before it is all over various gaming sites.
3/24/2009,"imho, this is bs, and preferential treatment for an alliance that ccp employees have been caught cheating for in the past.ccp needs to make a policy statement. either they do name changes for alliances who ""don't like their name"" (which was the case here, kenny didn't want to be kenny anymore, when they could have paid their $1b and formed ""bob reloaded"" the day they all joined kenny) or they don't do alliance renames.and to be fair, ccp needs to do this for anyone who requests it. and do it for free if bob got it for free."
3/24/2009,yeah.honestly if ccp want eve to be this living universe we the players build (which i think they do. that's how i read them letting the original disband stand) then they shouldn't run around erasing player mistakes.
3/24/2009,"first off, i don't think ccp should cave simply because there's a lot of posts in here, mostly from goonswarm + friends. if they caved to every demand goonswarm set simply because they can forum ***** a lot, this game would fall apart within like a week. :pthat said, i'm surprised at the amount of people demanding for this specifically. if this thread was about renaming bobr back to kenny, sure, i'd understand that request. that's not what this post is calling for, this post is calling for bobr being disbanded entirely.that's not a neutral stance where you want ccp to apply rules fairly, that's an attempt at using a messy situation and trying to leverage it in such a way you can screw bob over even more. that's an attempt by bob's enemies to try and own bob some more by forum whoring and making ridiculous demands. that has nothing to do with fairness, because the fair approach would be renaming them back and figuring out which gm allowed this to happen and why.as for the rules being broken. everybody has to accept that there can be situations that the rules never accounted for when originally written. it's almost impossible to write a rule and think of every possible scenario that might come up, especially in this case when these rules existed well before current sov mechanics. it's just as important to re-evaluate the rules to make sure they still apply in the current atmosphere, as it is to make sure the rules are applied fairly.in this case, bob was disbanded, they lost their name, their sov, everything. they reformed under a new alliance name that they still had lying around somewhere (with the 1b paid for when they created kenny), and started over at sov 1. they had to reform the alliance on that same day, because it had to be done before dt so sov claiming would start again. they had no time, as an alliance, to discuss a new name or anything of that nature, simply because of the time constraint. is it really that unreasonable for them to be allowed to now pick a name they like better (however lame it may be), because they didn't have a realistic chance at doing so when they had to emergency reform the alliance? certainly, some people might still say that yes, that is unreasonable, and some might say it's reasonable. saying that this was a clear case of favoritism is a stretch though, because i think there's at the very least a good case to consider whether an exception is justified here, not because it's bob and because they have their ""line to the ccp"", but because it's an alliance that had to reform under these conditions without having adequate time to decide on a name.either way, i doubt i'm going to convince most people posting here. i don't believe most posters here looked at it from an unbiased point of view, and tried to understand both sides of the coin. they're just here to drag bob's name through the mud some more, accuse them of more favoritism from ccp, and try to turn this giant whinefest into a way to punish bob (disbanding the alliance)."
3/24/2009,this is not an alliance vs alliance thing. it's about fair-play and the samle rules for all. i'm so sick of this ****
3/24/2009,"quoting stupidbypassing existing rules, and double standards are things the csm should be very interested in.hint: try change your name"
3/24/2009,"supported, utterly disgraceful ccp"
3/24/2009,"post on the first page summed it up.play by the rules the rest of us play by, or don't play at all. whether or not a mechanic is broken, a mechanic it is nonetheless, and until it's declared an exploit (or not), it's fair game, however your moral stance on it may be."
3/24/2009,"yet another database change provided to bob against the rules, and for free, from a ccp employee.ccp do you not see that you have close to zero trust left from the player base, with regards to your integrity and the integrity of the game.if someone at ccp, in bobs pocket, will do such a highly visible change to the games databases, it is beyond question that there have been many changes made on their behalf which are not visible.the one world model for an mmo was something special and unique; unfortunately it is now and forever blighted."
3/24/2009,"this is out of line ccp. one rule for all.if they didn't like their alliance name, they should have disbanded and reformed. the original bob was disbanded through legit game mechanics.no other alliance would be able to do this, so why bob? this needs to be looked at by internal affairs, although i suspect the outcome would be a whitewash.just to add, i am no supporter of goon's, in fact i have spent a lot of time killing them. i just think this is bs"
3/24/2009,"supported 2nd account, again disgraceful."
3/24/2009,"i was rather impressed when the first disband stood with no gm interference. but then they blatantly change the name for bobr's personal benefit. i thought we had gotten past this crap but obviously not, i think ill go for a free name change petition on the way!!!"
3/24/2009,"3rd account, terrible play by ccp."
3/24/2009,one game one rule.
3/24/2009,something needs to be done.
3/24/2009,"tbh i'm a little surprised at the eve population, i thought we were supposed to be a stoic, mature bunch.think about this. you're raging about an alliance getting their name changed.i honestly didn't know we had this many dry vag.inas in eve, holy smokes someone call president obama this is an emergency, kenny got their name back, call the marines, call the air force, send the seventh fleet to sweden, by all things holy this can not stand.grow up.look on the bright side, you get to kick bob's arse some more.what would rather have, fairness or fun?"
3/24/2009,i share the view of above poster.i think this is silly.
3/24/2009,ccp get ur fecking house in order ...
3/24/2009,everybody just say : rules are rules.
3/24/2009,"welp, after skimming first 10 pages, has ccp responded at all?"
3/24/2009,also this thread become a place where we can discuss this issue if you cant post in caod
3/24/2009,"wow, rarely have i seen so much alt posting on the forums."
3/24/2009,"i for one could never in good conscience vote for the disbanding of an alliance based solely on the fact that they've been renamed as a result of a petition. if this renaming is in fact deemed a developer misconduct then at most ""band of brothers reloaded"" should be renamed ""kenzoku"" ... disbanding an alliance (any alliance) based on a vote would disturb the balance of the game and have far reaching consequences.just because you're paranoid doesn't mean anybody is watching you..."
3/24/2009,now cry more or emoragequit about it.
3/24/2009,"bla bla. get over it people.first - regarding playerbase and no trust in ccp - i'm part of the playerbase and i don't agree with above remarks.i have plenty of trust in ccp and fixing this name issue does not subtract from that.claims that this would have not been done for another alliance under similar circumstances are so far unproven.names get changed all the time for including offensive words - fixing an annoying consequence of a broken game mechanic is not a bad reason imho.i'm not a member of bob, never have been a mmeber of any bob corp - i've never been allied with them or worked closely with them (afair).but i welcome that they will be recognizable as bob again. where exactly is the bad in that?how many bps did bob get pout of this name change? none.isk? none.ships? nonedyspro moons? none.any other material benefit? none.there's no real problem here.that a bored bob director betrayed them and gave access to goons is bobs bad luck. that the goons used that opportunity is their good luck and quick reaction. good for them.that they maximized their fun by grabbing the name in a newly created alliance - very goonish - wouldn't expect less from them. bit of fun too.but imho ccp should have given the name (nothing else of course) back right away. it was an unintended side-effect of game mechanics. aka a bug.gms fix effects of bugs via petition all the time.of course the same should apply to any alliance that lost their name in the same way to the same bug. were there any other cases? if such an alliance comes forward and can't get a similar name change - then yes - that would be unfair."
3/24/2009,well stain empire will get 1 bn isk back ?
3/24/2009,"actually, they saved 1 billion isk by having ccp do what disbanding and reforming the alliance would've done, as well as *losing* sov, which is what anyone else would've had to do if they wanted their name changeccp didn't give me back my billion when they decided to frack around with game mechanics."
3/24/2009,just change the name back to kenny.asscake
3/24/2009,"gm grimmi, who else in the past has been the recipient of such a renaming?"
3/24/2009,"grown up people live by rules created by other people. so actually it's more then logical that we protest here, when some people somehow are allowed to live by a different set of rules then us, where we all apperently accepted the same eula and thus the rules created by ccp to play this game.kicking bob's arse isn't what this is about at all, if i kick bobr, kenny or bob, it's the players that i like to fight against, so i don't really care that they changed the name, but it annoys me that ccp once again, favors the same alliance which they have favored in the past, to allow something where other alliances had to disband and pay another bil to get their name right.i mean why have rules in this game, when the company that created them doesn't even live by them."
3/24/2009,that
3/24/2009,total bs... noone else could have had this done for them.
3/24/2009,this comment comes as no suprise to me. grow up curso. don't judge us by your standards.stupid comments like this only make you look like a child. idiot.
3/24/2009,"and irl, just like in game, people can find over time that there are reasonable exceptions to rules, possibly even reasonable exceptions that were not accounted for when the rules were written.what it comes down to is that you trust the entity that is supposed to uphold these rules to use fair judgment in those situations. if you do not trust ccp to do this, why do you keep supporting them by playing their game?"
3/24/2009,"in all fairness, it's never happened before so that's really just conjecture."
3/24/2009,"/signedthis has shown outright favoratism and it shoudent be allowed ever.this just proves that some ccp are more than just friends with bob , they are bob."
3/24/2009,shame on you ccp.
3/24/2009,"i merely ask one question. what was stopping them from changing their alliance name just like any other alliance does? by disbanding their alliance and reforming it, paying the 1 bil isk and dealing with the sov change?because when i can't do stuff which i want to do in-game without causing my current operations great disruption, and losing a significant isk investment, i suck it up, i don't run off to ccp asking me to do it."
3/24/2009,i support this motion.
3/24/2009,"to quote wikipedia - ""citation required"""
3/24/2009,nepotism ftl!!!! for shame ccp. either let this be something any alliance can do or roll back the change and make bob use the same rules as the rest of us.
3/24/2009,was a way to remove kenzuko from the corp history
3/24/2009,i fully support this
3/24/2009,one game one rule.
3/24/2009,"you should try checking the ""check here if you want to give your support to the idea/discussion going on""like your other 1000 buddies~~~~~~~"
3/24/2009,"and yet this new gm grimmi post fails to address the reason why it was done. why was it ""warranted""? what *reasons* were there that they were allowed to bypass the sideeffects of rebranding that everyone else would have to go through?"
3/24/2009,they should at least be charged the 1b isk
3/24/2009,sorry ccp that answer doesn't cut it. if it was any alliance without a loooong history with ccp it would have worked but regrettably won't work in this case.a company with a history of game involvement by its employees should know better...
3/24/2009,because the gms felt they should not have to suffer that fate.
3/24/2009,"this is the answer given by ccp. kenzoku was not an alliance created after bob was disbanded. and, the name choice of ""kenzoku"" was certainly not due to the unavailability of the name ""band of brothers"". it was an industrial-alt alliance used by reikoku. alliance creation date: 2008.12.08 23:42ex-bob corps joined kenzoku to get sov back asap. ccp says that the petition for name change came when bob was disbanded, which means the name change petition dates almost 3 months after the creation of kenzoku alliance. 3 months is not a petition made within a reasonable timeframe. gm's logic fails, just the way ccp does once again by favoring bob and interpreting the rules for bob's benefit."
3/24/2009,"at least we can see how effective the assembly hall is now.840 supports, and completely swept under the rug by ccp. that is listening to your player base at its finest"
3/24/2009,"underlying message implies that the earlier goon action which lead to delve war ii is started with eula breach itself, else there is no reason to adjust that mentioned ""suffering""if any this answer implies not bob is getting a favor but are goons by not intefeering the first time, which is only corrected by a name change, and not by the punishment deserved for account sharing.what does puzzle me that i wouldnt want to win any war liek this myself, it would be a victory with a stain forever. whats next ? bribe ? hacking ? i never had so much fun in eve since war started, not the way it started, but the actual fun the game provides. as bob directors stated on radio , we love the fight itself, thanks for that.but this time now again, start with ""take away their sov"" , cause we cant hold on to delve, we get our asses kicked, weeeeee snif, mommieee look their name is changed , weeeget a new diaper and login eve instead of forums, and lets blow eachother up"
3/24/2009,special treatment club.
3/24/2009,"if thats maybe true, then why weren't other alliances favored by this rule aswell, from what i read even -a- once had to disband and recreate their alliance, stain empire, which first was named stian empire, wasn't allowed a simple name change. it's the fact that again it's bob(r). i mean the disband happened fully within the game mechanics, no hacking or exploits were used, so why would they be allowed a name change again? that bob at the time was incompetent enough to let an afk director in tinfoil is something bob is supposed to be held responsible for, now they lost most of their systems and also their name, but it is all their own mistake and i don't see why some rules have to be bend.also the reason why i still pay and play this game is because of the people in my alliance and corporation, if they would leave, i'd be gone too."
3/24/2009,/thread
3/24/2009,"this. i don't care if it's gm/customer stuff you don't want to post. this is simple proof or stfu.so, they chosse kenzoku as the new alliances name and then petitioned to have the alliance renamed bobr imediately after? yeah. sure.and even if: why did it take you 2 months to decide to change the name to bobr? if you have done it before, why didn't you change it right away then? it just smells fishy no matter how you look at it. and its your own fault ccp.just don't pull stunts like that if eve should ever get a half decent competitor. you would start to pay for stuff like that with customers actually leaving for another game."
3/24/2009,"what happened to eve being a harsh and unforgiving place? nothing that happened to bob warrants this breach of policy, this just smacks of ccp feeling sorry for them.and after the past problems with favouritism this is a /facepalm of epic proportions."
3/24/2009,"if 840 supports warranted disbanding an alliance, you might as well turn eve online into forum wars online.hell, 840 supports is pretty much less than nothing compared to the total population of eve, and almost all the support is coming from goons and friends, the alliances currently fighting bob.that's like asking the gbc/gkc/asscakes, whatever you want to call them, to vote on whether all of goonswarm should be banned from the game or not, and expecting a reasonable and unbiased result."
3/24/2009,why did grimmi not say why they broke the rules and changed the name?
3/24/2009,"nothing against bob, but this is unfair and once again showing ccp favortism/cheating for bob."
3/24/2009,"gm grimmi, thanks for a quick response.""while we worked onthe petition for about two months we do not feel that they shouldsuffer because of that.""why not, goons played inside of rules created by ccp. if you feel those rules are not good, just change them..of course in a reasonable time frame.""having them disband and lose sovereignty againwas not deemed appropriate in this case.""if this would be a noob alliance, than (maybe) yes. but you are talking about a top (?) alliance which just failed at choosing a proper director.because of some incidents considering favorism, eve community is watching you with argus eyes and thats for good reasons. trust was slowly building up, but now you again stress it. why ?? pr ? whats the real reason ? ""we do not feel"" doesn't sound like a reason to me.regards"
3/24/2009,"posts like this are the reason you guys draw so much heat - you might be right, this might be a poor game mechanic but if ccp will do this for you, they should do it for everyone - coming here after the fact and saying ""the game's broken (but it got fixed just for us) so deal with it"" just shows what a tard you are.never met anyone from bob and wouldn't really care except that this is just plain favoritism."
3/24/2009,"christ, learn to proof-read."
3/24/2009,"its not fair bob should suffer for there mistakes, thats just for the other alliances who should only exist to entertain them --- official ccp policy. ****poor gm spin/damage control is ****poor."
3/24/2009,"this day you have showed insane favoratism towards a specific entity ccp , as far i know isent that against ur own rules of conduct? gms/isd and other ccp personel cannot make exceptions like this can they?might aswell not have any rules if one your friends contacts you on msn (sir molle) and asks you to do something and you do it.ever thought about how it makes you look?the eve community thats aware of what favoratism happened today (any right minded person) does not agree to what you have done. why do you do it?"
3/24/2009,travesty. again.
3/24/2009,"lmaopathetic!!!its a game, move on. whats the real issue here?i for one am real happy aboutt this as i get to see the kids wining.....go bob....haha"
3/24/2009,"as of the day bob died and kenzoku was populated by ex bob corps, the new alliance should as of today have been pegged back to 1st day sov claim. at a simple level, to see that a system was alliance a sov 3, then after dt it is allaince b sov 3 is against every sov mechanic in the game.regardless of the ramifications for the alliance previously known as bob, your change in the database should have instigated a new entry for sov and set them back. seems that your relationship with this alliance is still as strong as ever.and don't use the 'not intefering' with the initial flattening of bob as some form of equality pr stunt, you had no grounds to help as everything was done within your own rules and mechanics. they screwed up, gs pounced on that, they usd bugged sov mechanics to create a foothold back, gs scuppered that on them as well - using in game rules and mechanics. bob have done nothing up to now, and have nothing done to them to qualify for any special treatment...nothing."
3/24/2009,"this is wrong its just another attempt to beat the system and please don't say ""pushing the button again"" we are talking about another failure of ccp to work to there own rules.when are we going to get an official statement without the hurf bluf"
3/24/2009,got a petition going for my own alliance renaming. if kenzoku/bobr can be renamed - why not me?
3/24/2009,"real grown ups don't have rules, real grown ups also don't believe in rights, santa clause or the tooth fairy. not that it matters but on what do you base a claim of favoritism?ccp has renamed alliances before, and they'll do it again in the future on a case-by-case basis.so yeah, feel free to call the waaaaaaaaambulance just don't expect anything to change.personally i still say the ""reloaded"" name is dumb and kenzoku was better, they basically got downgraded to a crappier name."
3/24/2009,doesnt matter if i like bob / kenny / bobr / beaver whatever.but this is just a giant joke....ccp is gone one step to far with this ****.
3/24/2009,"well, this is a different situation in the sense that they did lose all sov, and they did pay 1b for a new alliance. it's just that they didn't do the disbanding, someone else did, and they didn't change to the alliance with the name they wanted, but a temp one that has now been renamed to what they wanted.i can agree that this is a messy situation, but ccp felt it was justified, and i doubt this decision was simply made because it's bob. if you feel ccp is still biased, and after all the past outcries still favors bob more than anyone else, then pretty much all you can do is quit. complaining like this while you keep paying/playing doesn't help that much. if i am to believe the accusations, it certainly didn't help in the past (since bob is still ccp's favorite apparently, despite all past incidents).if i never showed up for work, but got paid every month anyway, with the only downside being that my boss calls me once a month to let me know he's not very happy with me not showing up, i'm pretty sure i wouldn't be too concerned about showing up any time soon. :p"
3/24/2009,what eula breach? if ccp found that any wrong doing they would have reset the bob disband and gave them delve back. since there were no rules broken they did not give them bob back.this new alliance is a whole different issue. if it isn't and ccp is bending the rules because of the bob disband then that is a whole different can of worms.
3/24/2009,"grimmi, we all know that you've changed names that have been petitioned for being offensive, just like the policy says. what we don't know is when you've made exceptions and changed names for being stolen, or misspelled, or anything short of the reasons in your policy - and in fact, the game's history provides plenty of examples of refusals to do so (stian alliance is the best example, but didn't ethereal dawn get namejacked once and have to disband and reform once their name freed up again?). this entire controversy would probably vanish if you could point to examples where you've made this exception for anyone besides bob/rkz/bobr. where are they? and why does it take two months to address a name change petition anyway? i have to assume that somebody suspected that it would cause a ****-storm and you had to deliberate over it - why didn't you listen to them?"
3/24/2009,"so why was stain alliance which typoed their name to ""stian alliance"" not allowed a free rename without paying a billion isk, losing sov etc back in the day? can someone answer"
3/24/2009,one rule for all.
3/24/2009,"hell, why not."
3/24/2009,"lol so what your saying is if ccp said ""ok guys we are going to give 1 alliance all the advantage and you can all go to the dogs you wouldnt complain just quit give up and play wow lol no you would complain and that is what peeps are doing this is a breach of the rules and it should be treated as such"
3/24/2009,"well the problem is if all of nc/goons cancelled their accounts today if they got their way and came back they would have a lot less to come back to and we all know it. the obvious solution is to make as much noise/disruption as they can and give ccp a real problem to solve unfortunatly we all remember how bitter ccp got when gs hot dropped a threadnought onto their forums, my advice is to make sure every player who thinks this is a **** move to post somewhere so that ccp realise people are annoyed at this favouratism."
3/24/2009,"why did they use a temp alliance and not create a new one with the correct name? because it would have taken time, time spent not gaining sov in systems. so they quickly jump in this temp alliance to circumvent the delay... then petition ccp to change their name to what they wanted in the first place.""i don't like my name"" has never been a valid reason for ccp to change any player, corp or alliance name. hell, there are alliances with valid reasons to have their name changed that have had their petitions denied since the game was released. (i.e. an alliance with 2 spaces in their name, which causes all kinds of problems)there are mechanics in place to allow for a name change. they have consequences that everyone else in the game has to deal with... except kenzoku.:ccp:"
3/24/2009,"not supported.it's obvious from the childish stamping of feet and the crying of rivers via the usual goonish forum spamming, that they feel their only true victory was the identity theft. this is what upsets them, the whole ccp luvz bobz & hatez uz is just a too obvious feint.when you cut through all the bull and rationalizing, when push comes to shove, the corp the goons made to steal the bob identity was just that. a corp created to steal bob's identity. ""well they weren't in da databases!"" yeah, sure. everyone knows who bob is and you're not them. you were therefore impersonating another group of folks, which is against the letter and spirit of the rules.i am glad to see bob get their identity back in some fashion."
3/24/2009,"i petitioned to have an alt change name, this was done 2 months after this birth. i was told that he was to old to have his name changed.kennny was over 3 months old when they petitioned and they got thier name changed.ccp, 1 rule for all, not just for bob"
3/24/2009,i support this .
3/24/2009,"you and others need some perspective... too far?it's a namelittle ascii characters that mean absolutely nothing in terms of the game.in fact i'd support any petitioned corp or alliance change. there is no real reason not to, as it doesn't change anything but in this case going from one stupid name to one even more asinine."
3/24/2009,if bob wanted their identity back why didn't they use the name bob reloaded in the first place? if they made the decision to join the kenzoku alliance to get sov1 back immediately they should be held to stick with that decision and not get to change their name to bob reloaded on a whim by breaking the rules
3/24/2009,"i don't support this. sadly there is no ""thumbs down"" thingie to tick."
3/24/2009,just ban all goons. nobody will cry for them.
3/24/2009,supporting
3/24/2009,disband the cheaters known as kengoku reloaded
3/24/2009,edit: double post
3/24/2009,"i find it kinda funny there are people supporting this, but also supporting ccp allowing a titan in amarr.so...rules?"
3/24/2009,"i hate goons, but seriously ccp? just rename the game to bob online already...ps - what ****es me off the most is the lack of an explanation. grow a pair, face your community, and explain your actions."
3/24/2009,"actually they mean quite a bit. the reason bob chose kenzoku was because they could get sov1 back immediately. if they really wanted to be bob reloaded so much they should have made that alliance and faced the consequences: no immediate sov and the advantages that came with itnow they get to change their name without paying alliance fee, without losing the remaining sov they have...obviously it does have in-game effects"
3/24/2009,i support this
3/24/2009,"why is it that ccp are singularly incapable of appreciating that consistently showing extreme bias towards one group within their game reflects poorly on them as individuals and as a company. the pathetic defence for their various actions - re-writing the rules, censorship and whitewashing are galling.now, if i was in .bob., i would be laughing (as their members are on the forums). this level of direct company support, and blatant support at that, is simply unheard of. and if i was a goon, i would be laughing (at the ccp given opportunity to lampoon both bob and its ccp members)restricting debate to caod (cesspool) and a miss-named thread in assembly, combined with an utterly trite statement from grimmi and mitnal in his over-zealous locking, shows that damage control is already in full swing. i noticed that wrangler could not quite contain his joy at goon tears one day, after eve as been and gone, i would hope that the devs would list all their characters in game, sadly i expect some would be so controversial, they could not bring themselves to reveal them all.. all jolly good fun really .."
3/24/2009,what? proof or stfu?
3/24/2009,"the entire alliance was changed, it's not as if kenny was replaced by beaver, it's still just a name change.the thing is, that when you look down at it all... it's. just. a. name."
3/24/2009,"i don't know but i sense nothing will change. also i am sorry csm team, but i think your hands are tied for such thing.wondering how long it will take to ccp provide us players true transparency. bring this news to bbc and show the world how connected ccp and bob are. i am pretty sure it would be nice if bbc post another news like ""ccp broke it's own rules and helped bob to reborn"".i don't care if it's done before, but it was not transparent to players.discussing ..."
3/24/2009,"three threads down or so.the same people moaning about ccp favorism at ""breaking a rule"" support having chribba moving his titan to amarr, thus ""breaking a rule""so u"
3/24/2009,"they should have to disband if they want a new name, this is complete bull****"
3/24/2009,"uhm i'm not sure in which country you live, but here in the netherlands we have something called laws and people here also have certain rights, maybe you support some anarchy party, but i still believe i have to live by certain laws and i also have certain rights, you know the right to vote is one of those.ccp as far as i know have only renamed alliances that had an offensive name, other alliances like i said before had to disband and be recreated. kenzoku is as far as i know not offensive at all, since it means something like family or something, so i don't see why they get their name changed for free. and favoritism, i think t20 is the best example about a ccp's employee's favoritism towards an alliance. i'm not saying everyone in ccp support bob, at least i surely hope not, or favor bob, but there are still certain ppl apparently that think it's ok to bend the rules created by ccp."
3/24/2009,does ccp report to any external authority with regards to how they conduct business?
3/24/2009,"gms i think you guys have forgotten to write this somewhere in the eula : ""all the crap written above doesn't work for band of brothers<U+FFFD>, band of brothers reloaded<U+FFFD>, kenzoku<U+FFFD>, band of brothers revenge<U+FFFD>[...]""if you have done that you wouldn't try to find some crappy reasons to justify what you just have done.just to remember a few things:"
3/24/2009,"i had my corperation name changed through petition long before this. i accidently misspelled the name i wanted and i petitioned it within minutes of creating the corperation, and it was changed by a gm within 30minutes.so i do not support this."
3/24/2009,"which is probably the exact reason why the rename was allowed. they had to emergency reform in a (now proven to be pointless) attempt to start regaining sov right away. they did not have adequate time to pick a new name for their alliance, and ended up being allowed a rename because of this (or at least i believe this to be the thought process behind it).i'm guessing the key thing here is that they did lose all sov and pay 1b when bob was disbanded. they requested this change at the time, and it took 2 months for gm's to decide. they just didn't form under the new name they wanted, because they didn't have time to. yes it's still an exception to the rules, but they did suffer the downsides (paying another 1b and losing all sov), even if they never planned for it. i'm guessing that's where the 2 month comment comes from, the loss of sov was 2 months ago (at the time of the petition), and the decision was only made now."
3/24/2009,"no, you must be a bob alt"
3/24/2009,"actually the explanation is there now, go read it. :p"
3/24/2009,"i don't care what that alliance call themselves, but this is not fair. nobody's gotten their name or their corporation's name changed before, it says so in ccp's rules that they can't. if kenzoku wanted to reform as bobr, they had to have dropped the alliance and reformed.not to mention kenzoku was an existing alliance separate from bob before bob was disbanded, so there's no reason why they should've gotten the name of bob(r) in the first place."
3/24/2009,"a. name. which. has. effects. in. game. with. respect. to. sovereignity. if they cared about their identity so much they should've created bob reloaded in the first place, they didn't and chose to use the alt alliance kenzoku which made sense strategically for sov reasons. they chose sov over 'identity', it was their decisionnow they're getting preferential treatment to change their name on a whim that no other alliance has ever gotten, keeping their remaining sov while being allowed to change their name. it is absolute bull****"
3/24/2009,"this is spot on, ccp claim that the name was filed for a change before the disband of bob. however kenzoku alliance was made 3 months before bob was destroyed. so please clarify this one. bob corps joined kenzoku to regain sov. not to get away from a name, their kenzoku alliance still has origional corps in this alliance due to it being a pet project."
3/24/2009,"jesus, pubbies are stupid.chribba has a titan in amarr space because it was created before the mechanic to keep them out was implemented. there are no 'rules' that say ""don't bring a supercap into empire"" there are just mechanics that make it impossible currently.(hint: if there was a rule that said no supercaps in empire, ccp could just move it.)"
3/24/2009,ok so 30mins isnt 3 months. is that your point?
3/24/2009,i got my name changed too but only after i got my previous name nerfed.free lube myholes
3/24/2009,just did and i am changing my support. the explanation makes sense.
3/24/2009,i support this
3/24/2009,in what crazy world is 'kenzoku' a misspelling of 'band of brothers reloaded' ?
3/24/2009,"i hate to say this, but just as i got liking you, you say something this idioticchribba has a dread in amarr, not a titan. the titan was just finished and there are people supporting moving it to amarr.and just as those mechanics are in place, so are the sov mechanics- mind you the sov dropping upon name change is a mechanic, not a rule.also, i might not be a pubbie."
3/24/2009,who has written the ccp eula rules if you have the ability and decision to break them on a whim when something is needed to change?you need an answer you community as posted above by someone else. saying 1 thing that is faulse and giving no evidence or a reasonable reason behind any change is a disregard to any rules which govern the ccp / white wolf firm
3/24/2009,"no alliance has had thier name changed, however many corps and characters have.the thing is, this situation has never happened before, where an alliance wanted to change thier name."
3/24/2009,"the new name also breaches the naming convention? 25 letters instead of 24?needs changing again then, maybe to something a bit better?"
3/24/2009,"tbh it`s nothing wrong with changing the name ccp, whats wrong is that you once again showed your bias.even with kenny having just a few towers deployed, if they had choosen the regular way all ships/cap ships would have be ejected from the posses and standings in general would be messed up.once again you played in god mode ccp."
3/24/2009,"so you're saying if they waited to re-form their alliance... the consequence would have been that they would have lost sov correct?in order to re-form quickly they had to use this already created alliance with a different name, right?so, they had a choice... either lose sov, or lose their name. they made a choice to keep sov.so what rule is it that says if you don't like the consequence of your decision... ccp will adjust the game to fit your needs? i'm sure a lot of scammed people would like to petition ccp under this new rule of ""not having to take responsibility for your actions"".whatever, capital/supercapital veldspar mining craft."
3/24/2009,"rules are rules. i say give them the choice to either disband and reform, or go back to the old name."
3/24/2009,supporting this after not being convinced by the gm explanation.favoritism is unacceptable in a mmo.
3/24/2009,no free go backs for bob - one rule for all!
3/24/2009,"i present something else to the table.while we worked on the petition for two months? i don't know about anyone else, but for me as a software developer who provided a support service to it's customers, two months is $4000 in wages for this support.how can that be even remotely justified???"
3/24/2009,"'stian' empire (or 'stian' alliance, can't remember which) made a typo and wanted to change their alliance name to stain empire/alliance. they had to disband and remake it because ccp wouldn't let them"
3/24/2009,"anything wrong with changeing the name... no, not if ccp would do this for everyone.however, would ccp do it for anyone else... notherfore, signed. i spent over 3 years in a corp that had a typo, ccp wouldnt change it."

3/24/2009,"did you forget the rest of what i said or just decide to ignore it?chribba's dread was in amarr prior to the lowsec restriction.those that are crying ""omg ccp are breaking rules"" support breaking those rules... these mechanics (because the big issue is the sov 3 in a few systems, right?)so it's ok to overlook mechanics for one individual, but not to an alliance, be it bob, stian, or whatever else. i see."
3/24/2009,is the 3rd bob gonna be called 'band of brothers revolutions?'
3/24/2009,i always wanted to have a surname but i misclicked early.can i have that fixed please? thanks.
3/24/2009,ccp's actions display a distinct lack of class
3/24/2009,"die beaver, die!bobr lol"
3/24/2009,"funny that you think it's about you, while it's about ccp favoring 1 alliance which happens to be yours. it doesn't really matter your alliance in what name or form will die soon(tm)"
3/24/2009,i support this.
3/24/2009,"at best this is a red herring...""those that are crying ""omg ccp are breaking rules"" support breaking those rules... ""are you trying to link all of the people supporting re-re-naming bobr to kenzoku to some other thread where people want to move chribba's titan/dread/whatever to somewhere it can't go on it's own? :psypop:"
3/24/2009,"i vote no! this gives goons + the 70% of all space holding alliances nap'ed with them something to poast about this whole debacle is made of win! imo.maybe ccp has had enough of goons + friends... it's ccp's game, if you don't like it i know a few wow accounts for sell ccp pulling everyone's 'equality' chain is ****in hilarious something else to raise your 'righteous swords' against.ivory"
3/24/2009,wow ccp is openly trying to sweep this on under the rug like they have so many times in the past and completely ignoring the facts. considering the kenzoku alliance was per existing for several months befor the ex-bob corps decided to join the alliance. oh ccp will you ever learn cheating is not the answer. if the its ok to be friends with players but when you start cheating like this and the many times in the past you lose credability. and to be honest in the end thats all you have.
3/24/2009,gm could you please give us 1 alliance that has had its name changed without losing sov.and please dont use a 1 member alliance that does not exist anymore or 1 that you started to get you guy off the hook as im sure we would all like to see these so called name changes
3/24/2009,"god ccp sure showed us.""take all of our space, disband our alliance and troll us into oblivion will you? *rename's alliance* you take that goonswarmmmmm :argh:"""
3/24/2009,this
3/24/2009,nout else needs said.
3/24/2009,dev alt spotted!
3/24/2009,the tears are strong in this one
3/24/2009,this is no surprise.
3/24/2009,why u let them rename!!!favoring isn't good. disband them and drop sov or rename back to kenzoku!
3/24/2009,"to me it doesn't matter if it's bob/kenny/beaver that had their name changed, or even that an alliance did have a name change without dropping sov and paying to reform.for me it is the basic principal that a rule of the game was ignored by ccp.which rule would it be next? and for whose benefit? seems to me that the door is now open for creeping illegitamacy in the decision making process of the gm's and devs.my vote is for this to be discussed by the csm and for ccp to listen hard to what the community has to say.zos"
3/24/2009,"ah yes, so what you are saying is that you support what ccp did and thus don't really care that other alliances have to pay fees to get their names straight, where you get to pay nothing, for something that was your leaders own stupid mistake. i like my logic and ccp's is flawd"
3/24/2009,"ccp, your gm and dev behaviors are an ebarassement to the mmo community. great game, please sell it to a smarter company before you destroy it completely, you've already killed solo and small gang pvp."
3/24/2009,"not a red herring as much as pointing out the irony.this is fueled mostly by hatred of bob/ken/bobr, and the level of whining and actual threadnought/threadspam level shows this.i honestly couldn't care less what they change thier name to, i don't feel it's any kind of an explot, or doing anything on the level that gms/ccp has done before that probably didn't make any waves.if ken was replaced by another alliance, that would be different. i'd be 100% with you all. but it's just a name change. the old policy should have been scrapped long ago when you look at pos, cap, and sov effects that have been added since that time. it's essentially a blue law that would have been better addressed under different circumstances.but if people here, a large majority, are so up in arms over this, than showing consistency regarding other game mechanics would make this look less like jumping on the bob hatewagon.that being said, i don't care about the name change, i dislike bob just as most do, i just don't see the big deal, as nothing has changed but the name. it's not a new alliance, not a replacing alliance, but the same one.and as a consequence to this, ccp will now, or should now, allow other corps and alliance change thier name without sov consequences.that ""pendulum"" swings both ways, i agree it should be allowed, but that it should be allowed across the board from here on out."
3/24/2009,"1 game, 1 rule"
3/24/2009,nobody forced the bob member corps to join the existing kenny alliance. they should have spent the money on the day they lost the previous name to buy the new one they wanted. ccp should revert this change.
3/24/2009,supportin' this. ccp position seems biased here.
3/24/2009,"ok, fine then i will disclose, its indeed all in the name, as alot refer too.kenzoku is a registred trade mark name and the name is licensed and protected. therefor it cannot be used as the name of a alliance ingame or outside on forums. as u can judge from the site itself, the @ means its trademarked name"
3/24/2009,"crybabies, they have what? 4 systems with sov 3, they lost their alliance due to crappy gamemechanics, get over it."
3/24/2009,"we felt sorry our friend bobby lost his name through legitimate in game action so we ignored the alliance rules which they could have used to create this new name and renamed their alliance for them.please provide 1 example of this happening previously. oh that's right, you don't discuss petitions because you might be embarassed."
3/24/2009,hbo would like a word with you.
3/24/2009,okies heres 1 to throw in the hat say they were war deced name changed war becomes invalid so does that mean we can all get out of alliance wars by changing our alliance name and keep sov too nice work

3/24/2009,"yes, i'm sure they'll heed your dire warning. i see the jfs fleeting up as i post this.thank you sir."
3/24/2009,"you're missing the point, by about a mile.there is currently an in game way to change your alliance name. several alliances before have had to do it the correct way, and suffer the consequences of that. it's called disbanding your alliance, and reforming it.the name change was never the point, the fact that bob was given a ""free pass"" to get that name change, when several alliances before have had to do it the in game and more restrictive way is what the issue here is.lets see what bob avoided by getting this free name change:lost sovereignty1bn isk feemyriad logistics issuesif you can't see the issue and why it's a problem, you're just being coy. as far as the bob hate is concerned, maybe that hate partially stems from the fact that this is a second recorded time that bob has been directly helped by ccp outside of normal game policy. notice i said recorded time, because frankly, we don't know what other little favors have been going on behind the curtain. we'll never know."
3/24/2009,"grimmi's explanation was garbage. ccp and their employees have been shown repeatedly to be dishonest, and scheming cheats when it comes to their game. there needs to be a audio question and answer session, real time, where ccp makes a feeble attempt to rationalize this blantant, repeated, and ongoing favouritism.of course, they will do none of this, and will only do their best to sweep it under the rug, while continuing to cheat to aid kenzoku, and yet again spit in the faces of their playerbase."

3/24/2009,no.get over it.stop crying.try another emotional alliance director and do it all again.
3/24/2009,"the whole matter with this is that it shouldn't even be disallowed for that reason- even if done in the past. changing a name should not affect sov, maybe require a 1bn renaming fee- the mechanics should be in place. maybe i'm actually just advocating that, because tbh i don't really care about ken, or what happens in delve as i carebear away these stupidly long cap skills...and there are devs in gs also, should we assume that there are shenanigans afoot? don't take this as me trusting bob or not hearing you out, because i do, and to a large extent agree with you.the rule should however be modified to protect sov/poss, in any case."
3/24/2009,i support this.
3/24/2009,yes for a disband
3/24/2009,"i don't think ccp has a full appreciation of how dangerous a situation like this is to their game. it is so ungodly frustrating to fight an entity in game that has developer support, its like your fighting the game itself. how long will we tolerate this ****?? is it time for another open letter to ccp? no, its already gone past that point. frankly i find this **** too hard to stomach:- spawning bpos- handing out motherships - changing the titan memorial rules when molles titan died - refunding titans after saying they never would 2 titans in game died to ""broken mechanics"" 1 azn and 1 d2 both pilots petitioned the loss but no exception was given. a good policy. the game has rules, they can change, but until then we live, fly, and die by them. people care that its bob you did it for, because you have a long history of doing them special favors, but it really doesnt matter that its bob, most people recognize that. it matters that you broke the rules and gave someone special treatment. whats even more insulting is that you changed their name to band of brothers reloaded, as though, by not giving them their original name back somehow it would be ok. how stupid do you think we are? what a disgusting insult.this action is shameful beyond words ccp. your failure to act last time and your continued, blatant cheating is a slap in the face to every person who plays the game."
3/24/2009,"the forum activity is pretty light all things considered and this is not fueled by bob hate its fueled by a hatred of cheaters, the fact this referes to bob is their choice not my design."
3/24/2009,"this post has been cleared of inappropriate content.regards,the eve online moderation team"
3/24/2009,"gm response fails to address why they are allowed a name that is 25 characters long, when the rule is 24 characters max."
3/24/2009,"on one hand, i agree with you. honestly, changing your alliance name should be as easy as paying a fee, enter name, press buttan. that said, up until about 48 hours ago, that wasn't the rule. the rule was magically changed, on the fly, for bob. if you can't understand why that raises the hackles of several of us, i am not really sure what to tell you.there may or may not be devs in goonswarm (i honestly don't know, though i would imagine the chances are high we have at least one), but here's the difference: there isn't an ny times expose article about how a ccp employee knowingly helped us get a bunch of expensive bpo's. that article exists about bob. there is no speculation that developer favoritism might have happened in this case, we know it's happened. for all intents and purposes, we now know it's happened twice. so frankly the ""well, goonswarm has developers, they might be cheating to"" is a strawman at it's finest."
3/24/2009,no.i am quite sure it has been done before.
3/24/2009,"true it seems that ccp are worried about losing beaver membership fees ""change our name or we will rage quit"" all on msn or irc.what will we see next jove space opens with bobr already in space with sov 3 and i guess it will be more broken than delve."
3/24/2009,"no examples, no proof, but i am sure!!!!"
3/24/2009,"it's been ""not done"" thousands of times more then it's been done, and i'd still like to see proof of it being done. nobody forced them to use kenzoku, they made a choice. they can live with it as everyone else in eve has lived with their choices. if even capitalizing a letter and not changing the name at all otherwise is forbidden, then this is too sorry."

3/24/2009,disband.
3/24/2009,"i'm not sure who is worse ccp or "".bob."""
3/24/2009,"no matter what their new alliance name is they will still be just as horriblerise put up more of a fight defending their own space than "".bob."""
3/24/2009,how about no
3/24/2009,how about you are a bob pet and don't really have your own opinion so we are just going to ignore you?
3/24/2009,just ask haargoth to disband it.
3/24/2009,1 game 1 rule
3/24/2009,"supported because the ""explanation"" is even more fail than the renaming itself.:facepalm:"
3/24/2009,**** you ccp
3/24/2009,"no matter how this become to be, but it should not happen.who ever made this has to realize it was a mistake to give preferred treatment to anyone on the game. this is a complete denial of the premise of a living universe where every single action has a consecuence on the way the universe and on the players."
3/24/2009,"hey, how many alts did you create just to get the votes up on this one?"
3/24/2009,1
3/24/2009,"the former members of bob chose kenzoku as their alliance name. no other alliance has ever been able to change theirs, and thus, ccp allowing kenzoku to get rid of their terrible name for an even more terrible name is unacceptable. this not only continues to prove ccp's favoritism towards this terrible alliance, but sets a bad precedent of changing alliance names. ccp needs to undo this change and make the members of kenzoku either lose their sov and change the name by making a new allian ce (the way the game is supposed to work) or keep the terrible name the chose for themselves (something every other player in eve who made a terrible name has to deal with)."
3/24/2009,meh....
3/24/2009,"you're arguing semantics. i'm sure you're well aware of the fact they lost all their sov 3/4, considering it was a big factor in goonswarm conquering delve. whether they made a new alliance, or used kenzoku, the sov 1 thing should have happened either way. the requirement for sov 1 is that the towers have been anchored for at least 7 days, not that they have been anchored for 7 days under the current alliance tag, which is exactly why kenzoku regained sov 1 the dt after the disband.so yes, they did lose their sov, because in this context, when talking about lost sov, it means losing sov 2/3/4, not sov 1, which would come back the first dt after the alliance reform either way."
3/24/2009,oh my goodness.. you guys cry wayyyy too much... wahh wahh wahhfor the slow people out there i do not support this. grow up.

3/24/2009,shut up *****!
3/24/2009,cry more *****!
3/24/2009,"gm's/dev's have a responsibility to be fair and impartial. they should not be getting involved.if the way goonswarm took down bob was legitimate, bob should not be given 'outside' help, they should have to fight using the tools all players have at their disposal. if they want to rename their alliance, then let them do it via the same options every player has available to them.if goons cheated or used an illegal exploit to take down bob, the servers should of been rolled-back, goons disbanded and their leadership banned permanently as an example of what happens to cheats."
3/24/2009,this.
3/24/2009,u shut up too *****
3/24/2009,"rename them back to kenny, then let them disband and recreate if they want another name. i mean wtf, really?!? what happened to internal affairs keeping track of bs like this?"
3/24/2009,my first post after 1 yr of eve playing... (besides tech. support)so imagine how i feel about this.
3/24/2009,1 game...1 set of rules for all.
3/24/2009,"dont worry, in a year or two there will be threads about goons."
3/24/2009,special treatment to bob/ken is unfair.i'm dissapointed in ccp.
3/24/2009,"dont worry, in a year or two there will be threads about goons.if your right,its cuz we got there our selves.dont need help from a ****ing dev to win a fight"
3/24/2009,"so you are saying they could have chosen to go with .bob. went it happened, but chose kenzoku because it was easier, less painful and cost less. and for that, they get to change their name because they chose the easier way?"
3/24/2009,"/signedtoo many favours, no rules broken to take their name, no rules should be boken to fix it."

3/24/2009,"nah im reffering to the attention you ( goons ) dont get.i didn't talk about stuff that you and the nc and drone region guys and fountain guys and creepy directors accomplished, as nobody cares about this anymore."
3/24/2009,frankly if ccp are going to run eve like it was a freeshard where the guy who's running it does special favours to his mates i dont see why we should pay for it.theres plenty of impartially run mmo's out there - i dont understand why ccp has repeatedly shown that they cant get their own staff to act professionally?
3/24/2009,"because after all, you still p(l)ay?"
3/24/2009,that can be changed...
3/24/2009,"i`m supporting this topic, disband bobr"

3/24/2009,before my time with goons.but another example of ccp's lack of edicate(etiquette?)
3/24/2009,"i'll support ccp undoing the name change and then bob can decide whether they want to disband and reform under a new name or keep kenzoku.i think an automatic disband though is a bit too harsh since all bob actually did was ask for a name change, whomever actually changed it was the only person to break game rules."

3/24/2009,a game mechanic was used to kick your corps out of boba game mechanic was used to disband your alliancea game mechanic was used to even create a corp to keep the name from being used again.a game mechanic was not used to change your alliance name. gm access or something like it was.what happened to your alliance wasn't fair but oh well. cry more kenny boy.

3/24/2009,neither should you for currently being in direct conflict with the alliance in question~if that rule applied (and to alts as well) that would probably remove like 90% of the votes in here.
3/24/2009,supported.
3/24/2009,"yeah, goons spamming certainly indicates which topics are in need of attention."
3/24/2009,if only for the drama and to make them feel even more persecuted!
3/24/2009,shame on you ccp!
3/24/2009,"i'm a new player who was drawn to this game after hearing about the whole bob disbanding drama. the idea of a game where player created countries fight and win by real world espionage turned this game from something i'd never heard of to something i had to play. the true sandbox - game makers set the rules, and within those rules players do whatever they want, that is tremendously appealing.changing the rules when the rules do something you don't like ruins all of that."
3/24/2009,"to be fair, i can think of one notable example of this happening previously.however, as bob wasn't involved, and in fact the people in question are allies of our enemies, i very much doubt we will see a similar threadnaught demanding they are disbanded.it's a name people. the name of collection of geeks in an interweb astro-warrior game.chillax.added: ""redux"" would have got my vote over ""reloaded"" - just sayin'"

3/24/2009,"all of their sov wasnt taken which is why everyone is making a big deal, duh.p.s. you spelled your name wrong"
3/24/2009,what a shame ccp.../disband bobr
3/24/2009,"i really can't believe we're still seeing this type of treatment. how is ccp trying to be neutral? you'd think that they would have learned their lesson the last, oh, i don't know, 3 times they were caught in bed with bob. seriously. these events don't affect me directly, but it still bothers me.and actually, i don't think disbanding bobr is enough. i think that all corps in bobr should be disbanded and the corp members shouldn't be allowed to be in a corp/gang/alliance together, ever."
3/24/2009,multiple broken rules...i support this
3/24/2009,"i keep hearing people claim that this has happened before, but i have yet to see an actual example."
3/24/2009,"rules are rules, and everyone must follow them."
3/24/2009,they must lose sov and pay to remake alliance. not just change the name for free. this is sad.
3/24/2009,"like bob is only one, i've petitioned for my alt name to be changed from stupid letters kdkgfjkdjhg to a real name and got it :)and you'd be shocked the favors to certain large carebear corp on reimbursements ah well, the squeaky wheel gets the grease...good thing other corps know how to keep their mouth shut when a small favor comes their way."

3/24/2009,"sorry i don't believe this for a second. i have a corpmate that was unable to change their name and we are just a regular corp in eve, no strings attached. and if it is true for you, then once again why the breaking of their oh-so-strict policy for some and not others? either way, its a screwup. that is the issue here, enforcing the rules uniformly for all players."
3/24/2009,the rules should apply equally to all not at the whim of some gm who decides to break them for someone.
3/24/2009,hey guys he's right look how much we suck

3/24/2009,rules shouldn't be ignored for any alliance. either let every alliance do it or none.
3/24/2009,no more preferential treatments!
3/24/2009,is this the queue for free t2 bpo's?
3/24/2009,cry more it doesnt make you all look pathetic or anything.this is not the first time something like this has happened but because big bad bob you are all afraid of is involved it must be bad.your tears they are delicious
3/24/2009,"you are correct, this is at least the third or fourth time that a ccp employee has unfairly favored bob.edit: there's plenty of pubbies and even bob pets posting in favor of this. it really is an issue that transcends player politics. a developer has to ensure that all of their employees act impartially, period. there's no rational way to argue against that."
3/24/2009,"rename kennie to band of brothers (or bobr to bob)it was underhand what happened to them and if it happened to any other alliance it would be treated as an exploit. everyone needs to get off their high horses and give them the respect they deserve,ccp should be enforcing measures to make sure alliances like bob don't get stung like this again.."
3/24/2009,i've failed to see a single non goon&co+alts post.its pretty funny
3/24/2009,disband them.... or sov 0

3/24/2009,no we failed to realize that even after you got out you would still just lose caps and not gain any space. i think if we had known as much we wouldn't have bothered camping you into pr- in the first place.
3/24/2009,ccp is violating our civil rights. someone call martin luther goon.
3/24/2009,no to preferential treatment. yes to consequences.
3/24/2009,"they used kenzoku as an alliance because it gave them a sov advantage day 1. if they don't like that choice, there are ways to change your alliance name through non-developer intervention."
3/24/2009,i support this.
3/24/2009,"actually, you know what? they managed to find a name that sucks even more than random japanese gibberish. and it makes it easier for us to scam using the real bob. i say let 'em keep the name."
3/24/2009,"i have a dream....that all players are treated equally, and the creators of our grand universe follow the rules that they have claimed a desire to enforce on behalf of all of us.that those band of brothers would gain the advantage of real stability through professional therapy.that each and every player can play this wonderful game without fear of favoritism of one group over another in regards to the rules......and thnx for the idea cipher7......hehehe"
3/24/2009,"this issue isn't about new bob name, it's about a change in ccp public policy that they haven't made public.if they are providing alliance name changing services, they need to let everyone know how to do it"
3/24/2009,"just to plaster this up again for the beaver fans:it is not about the name!i mean don't get me wrong, the new name is hilariously bad""reloaded""? somewhere laurence fishburn is taking the blue pill...its about the bending of rules by ccp yet again.why have an ""internal affairs"" department promising oversight and then go bend the rules for the same guysthat prompted the ""internal affairs"" department in the first place? (t20 etc, etc)and please, do not point out gm grimmies smokescreen ""nothing to see here, move along"" post.apparently we are deemed 12 years old. (no i'm not :p)"
3/24/2009,i support this petition. one set of rules for all players. no exceptions.
3/24/2009,shut up
3/24/2009,"i agree that it will be fun trolling them out of this name as well, but the issue here is that ccp bent the rules for these arrogant buttes, which is totally unacceptable. bob knew the rules when they chose to run with kenzoku and keep sov over having sov take a little longer and creating a name that isn't stupid. they should have to live with this choice, or do as everyone else does and have to lose sov to form a new alliance. i'm sure hundreds of players have petitioned to change an alliance name in the history of this game, and this is the first case of it happening. on top of that, it doesn't even follow proper naming convention (25 characters instead of 24, and lowercase letters in the corp ticker)!"
3/24/2009,"i spk for myself, and my view does not reflect my allaince's view in anyway i hereby place my vote to get ridof bob reloaded, 1 rule for all, no bias to one alliance period."
3/24/2009,"aye. man i hate getting lied to all the time by ccp. ccp, you did not have a flexible policy with regard to renaming alliances. ccp, you did consistently make corps and alliances disband and reform to change their names. the game is about 6 years old. we have 6 years of history to see how things worked. ccp, bob/kenny/beaver asked you to cheat. they asked you to do something that you hadnt in the past done for anyone else, nor would do for anyone else. they asked you to cheat for them, and ccp you did it. you, ccp, can blah blah blah rationalize and lie all you want, but thats all it boils down to, plain and simple. i dont care what side of the war a person is on. i dont care if someone wants to be called prince. i dont care if someone wants to be a weirdo and use odd symbols in a name and be referred to as the artist formerly known as prince, its not the name that matters. what matters is that with incidents like this, ccp demonstrates how dishonest, insulting, and unprofessional they are on some issues. this leads to the bigger question which is: if theyre willing to act so poorly in the public eye, what nonsense are they pulling when they know nobody is watching. to those that say out with the conspiracy theories and away with the tinfoil hats, i say, you are dodging the issue. stop. just stop. its all just blah blah blah to me. i, and others who are angry, do not have conspiracy theories and tales of alien abduction and cia planned coups. bob asked ccp to cheat for them. ccp did it. if ccp did that, and other things, on behalf of bob, they arent trustworthy. its plain, its simple, its public, its fact. ccp might get some things right, but they got this and a bunch of other things absolutely wrong."
3/24/2009,"an interesting thing to note is that issue is a public one - as opposed to private one. the subject of discussion is not a character, not a person. it is a pure game entity. therefore, there is no reason to hide any gm action or conversation. all gm action on this matter should be publicly available, because there is no valid reason to keep it hidden.is there a reason to hide this information? let people know"
3/24/2009,"give us the list of criterias that needs to be filled for a wish to change alliance name to be approved. and the timeframe starting at alliance creation within whitch the petition must be filed.if you are going to give silly answeres as in the gm thread atleast have the ****ing balls to back it up with something other then empty words..ive been playing since 06 and every year some silly **** about ccp favouring one entity is brought up and more often then not you can guess who is on the reciving end.. (well, not any more since we don't know what the hell bob wants to call themselves next week)"
3/24/2009,"ccp your community are asking for an explination as to what is going on and why it seems that you are increasingly bias to 1 faction in eve.1st. saying in a pre prepared statment that kenzoku request there name to be change when they formed up there alliance. however the corps known as band of brothers corps, were not even in kenzoku. so your statment gm grimmi is false information. unless you are saying that they asked for a name change 2 months before there alliance was disbanded. making false and unjust decisions against eula when this is what governs ccp is against your own legal documentation. 2nd. this whole issue is mostly with regards to ccp making rules, setting them in motion, making them a legal document. then changing aspects of it to allow an alliance to control ccp decision making. internal affairs seems to think this decision has no bias in this. however your own eula rules commented by people in this thread signed by senior managment at white wolf and ccp game is critisized for controlling in game politics. 3rd. game exploits, dont even try to say that band of brothers were not involved with this. their own leadership has said ""if there is a game mechanic we can use so we get the upper hand, we will!"" seeing large numbers of towers in 1 place setup the same, announcements by ccp of the setups matching these setups used in previously owned space delve.then it comes down to supercapital reimbursement for no reason at all. reimbursement of titans because ""they have lag"". when further released documentation by ccp games has said that lag is not an excuse to replace ships lost in a combat situation. however to reimburse 2 titan class ships to 1 previously mention alliance is getting a little rediclious. so through all of this. i would like to ask some simple questions. is it also fair to assume that a chars in game name of ""sir molle"" is a ccp employee1. who does govern ccp and why are they allowed to interfere with in game mechanics. who completes the audit needed which manages ccp. 2. can we get a statment with a real actual reason as to why ccp games and white wolf felt that a name change of an alliance was critical. then to plz also comment why a name is meant to be ""4-24 chars"" long, however band of brothers reloaded is 25. 3. plz provide a list as to any alliance who has their alliance name changed in the same fashion as this (also quoted in your prepared statment)4. will csa be allowed to have interaction with this decision making. with this thread now reaching 57 pages, which is 1697 posts and alot of posts in favor by the ccp community to not change the name."
3/24/2009,"supported.something like this required attention and voting of the full eve online community. if one name gets changed due to petitions, then everyones names can be changed."
3/24/2009,"this is truely amazing. all your posturing. all your petty demands. you dont get it do you. they do not have to prove or provide you anything. they have n o t h i n g to awnser for. you are not some all powerful agency who can shut them down for non-compliance. there are no laws to bend them to.the only thing they would respond to is loss of revenue. if you really want them to listen....quit.but funny thing is everyone posting thier little thumbs up in this thread and the other 1200 threads wont quit.so keep screaming into the wind. i wonder sometimes where the world would be if more people went to this length and put this much passion into real life issues...just lolpsthe csm is nothing more than a sham, something to make you think you have a real voice....sad really..."
3/24/2009,"i think people keep playing because they enjoy the game. i'm glad they play, because the game would be a lot less fun without other players (even the ones in the alliances we are at war with).however, i think people also want every player, corporation and alliance to obey the same rules."
3/24/2009,"yea, **** you all for demanding clarification on what rules are in place vov"
3/24/2009,oh no... we dont have a spy in the bob holding corp to disband them again... lets flame ccp....
3/24/2009,"not supported, couldnt give a **** what poeple call themselves tbh."
3/24/2009,"law or justice?we all know that the disbanding of bob was done in a way that begs the question of what was intended by ccp policy with regard to the one button option. that sort of thing was not intended to be used in the way it was. we know that.further, the letter of the law...is open to interpretation in its application.and none of you are the judges in this case. you are the public."
3/24/2009,"ccp has done it again, kenny can have whatever name they wish, but they must do it the proper way, leave kenzoku and create a new alliance as bobr no problem herebut renaming an alliance is pure nonsense and against the rules, guess i ll start petitions to change my name cause... well at least i have a valid reason it starts from a and when i began eve i had no idea of what impact will have in fleet fightsdo not disband bobr but change their name back to kenzoku, if they wish they can create a new alliance from scratch as the rest of us peasants"
3/24/2009,"registering disapproval at the manner and method.bad precedent, especially with the precedent regarding sov mechanics."
3/24/2009,"you are complicating simple stuff,disbanding of bob even though i do not agree with the action, was under valid game mechanics, ccp is to say what should be from now on and change the specific mechanism, but what has happened is history and more importantly within the ruleson the other hand renaming an already named alliance is against the rules of ccp not to even mention the character limit. not a game mechanism not even related to button within the game or option of every single eve pilot, you got pumpered again, on the backs of the rest that cannot because we must follow rules that you do not"
3/24/2009,"plainly said, we the community pay the wages of the gm's devs and any other employee working on this game. so we want answers.taxpayers get answers when a political figurehead screw up, this is not much different.ccp we need answers now. please stop avoiding us and trying to dodge a bullet."
3/24/2009,"oh mister high and mighty, whats that make you then? why are you special?"
3/24/2009,"again either you did not fully read my statement, or chose to ignore the point i was making. lets re-clarify:1.) they can change rules or policy in the game without advanced notification or clarification.2.) i was saying the only way to really make them sit up and take notice is a mass cancellation of accounts which in turn would cause a financial statement to the 'powers that be' and would cause serious discussion among the top echelon of executives that govern the policies of the company. what most of you still completely fail to realize is that the only true power you wield is the power that comes from your 15(insert currency here) a month. they know that even if 10% of you who have posted quit, your nothing more then a drop in the bucket, because tbqfh 90%+ of eve's population either doesnt know about the situation or just doesnt really care."
3/24/2009,ccp is too busy sending all of their money to an unknown offshore bank account to respond.watergate: apocrypha.
3/24/2009,"1. yes the goons whine alot. jesus god please stop whinging.2. yes, in this case it is warranted. i am not a goon fanboi. pretty much goons are pathetic.3. can ccp please freaking respond. obviously a lot of people are upset and it does appear to be favoritism.4. my guess is this is just temporary anyway, .bob. are having fun at goons expense and they will reform under a new name eventually since the remaining systems they have dont amount to much. 5. people who think the original bob disbanding shouldnt have been allowed are straight idiots and fanbois. it was legit game mechanics. gtf over it. renaming an alliance without losing sov is not legit game mechanics."
3/24/2009,the same rule of all of us ?hum in the old times for sure but not anymore ... and finaly not fair for the rest of our community except kenzoku/bob/bobr !
3/24/2009,"this is one of the most assinine statements ive read yet. since you want to compare this to polotics, if a polotician screws up yes he must, by law, awnser for his actions or be 1.)removed/voted out of office 2.)arrested/imprissoned based on the sevarity of the actions.this is a company providing a service, a service who's terms can be changed at will by said company, in which you agreed to by clicking the 'accept' button on the liscense agreement.your only true recourse is to quit or deal with it."
3/24/2009,"i don't exactly like my name, can i has get it changed?"
3/24/2009,"actually the ""prestige"" this whole situation brought on the old bob vs goon alliances made this known to the whole community. they even update it in the in game news networks. so people do know, look at how many views and supports this topic got. what made ccp different from the gold digging companies of other games is how well they pay attention to their customers. take away the core players from the game, then it will fall like a house of cards. one rule for all ccp, no favoritism. don't allow yourselves to become like one of those companies."
3/24/2009,"how many fsking bugs and poor mechanics are in this game that every freaking player has to deal withyou spoiled, cheating piece of crapand damn, you had a chance to rename your alliance and you chose that ? phailbuffet"
3/24/2009,this isnt caod
3/24/2009,"rules are rules, can't break them, even if it's your own rules. especially as we all pay equally, and so, have equal rights.bob's want bob back - they start new alliance, and do it the way, everyone's done it before."
3/24/2009,"i'm confused, what happened again? a gm did something to favor bob... really, a gm? so this gm did something epicly horrible? and we're sure it's a gm? so and like it was something game changing and unallowable? what could this supposedly gm have done? change a name? dear god, black is white, up is down, bob are goons. it's a ****ing game. something unintended did happen... remember when those guys bumped people out of a pos with titans. game mechanics were in place to allow it, but zomg, it was so haxorly bad and game changing... it must stop!!! and it did. and players got threatened with bans because of using a game mechanic in an unintended fashion. take 2, an alliance got disbanded in an unintended way. it wasn't closed, it wasn't disbanded... corp after corp got kicked until even the executor corp got kicked... not left... from it's own alliance. now compared to titan bowling to dooms day a few dozen ships, this is a far greater issue when it comes to game mechanics. bob lost most of it's space. 3/4 of 0.0 is down here making sure it stays that way. we've laughed, we've giggled, and all that's really happened in the end is, we got our name back... sorta. guys, outside your door is this big wide expanse called the outside. if you find yourselves really thinking that this is such a huge deal... get your fat asses up, walk outside, and watch the wind blow and the leaves rustle for a few. take a look at that real girl jogging down the street. take a few deep breaths, and then realize that there's far bigger issues in this world than a stupid game name being changed... because ffs, it doesn't affect your life unless you are a cyber tool who can't let it go."
3/24/2009,"tell me about it so, now that ccp are allowing name changes, who do i contact to change mine?"
3/24/2009,"people still don't seem to understand it's not about the name, lol. if a hooker gave your friend a bj and gave you nothing despite you paying, would you be mad? sure. now imagine it happening a second time.itt: learning comprehension died."
3/24/2009,does the csm have a position on this?
3/24/2009,nerds whining about their e-civil rightsnews at 11
3/24/2009,oops... refer to 5 post up please
3/24/2009,"again , which msn contact was it this time?"
3/24/2009,"the mittanni clearly intended to disband your alliance.also this isn't about a simple name change, its about the rules."
3/24/2009,"it is a big deal only because with the name change you kept the sov, you could have done it the proper way as the rest, create a new alliancei agree with you that game mechanics happen to not work as intended and are getting fixed all the time, but thats game mechanins, alliance name change is not a game mechanism, it is pure favorism and that is unacceptable by ccp or any other company that want to see their fixed rate paying customers the same"
3/24/2009,"renaming kenzoku was completely unnecessary, i thought name changes were just for ""offensive"" names and such, not for people deciding hey we want to jump into this alliance to quickly get some sov and then change it to a new name later"
3/24/2009,"again, you're quoting rules of a game... not even a real sport, but a cyber online fun game. and even worse, nobody is affected by this one b/c nobody who want's a name change has a history to back up the logic for their change like bob does. grow up you tool"
3/24/2009,"i'd like an immediate refund of the isk spent when reforming our alliance after it was formed incorrectly the first time please, just for the sake of fairness.let's see if that happens.... disband bobr... if you pronounce the ticker it sounds more like band of bristolians now."
3/24/2009,"firtst of all i corrected what you saidactually it was labeled an exploit, and then suddenly because of your whining it was not labeled an exploit anymore despite no in game methods being there to stop it. then you did it dozens of times a day for a solid month, and then the very day goonswarm launched its first mothership, thereby gaining the capability to do it back to you, the gms suddenly said it was an exploit again and not to do it.no sign of favoritism there really."
3/24/2009,or they could roll back the sov and give us our alliance back... this is the far less of 2 evils... it's not like we didn't suffer initially. talk about wanting to kick a guy while he's down.
3/24/2009,shame on ccp.. one rule for all..
3/24/2009,so even you admit that this was special favouritism ccp only shows to bob.
3/24/2009,"at this point this is a 58 page thread.of course its complicated. the matter is still under investigation by ccp. any changes ccp makes will benefit all of eve. in fact, i could reasonably argue that what ccp has done already has opened up all sorts of possibilities for flexibility in how ccp applies these rules. this game is not static."
3/24/2009,i support this!
3/24/2009,"i like your ""it's just a game"" defense.""it's just a game, get over the fact we're at the center of yet another rule-breaking fit of nepotism, it's not important. it's just a game. go outside. let us sweep this under the carpet with our other shenanigans. nothing to see here!"" and then you see a ccp logo in an open closet making humping motions towards a loud slurping noise."
3/24/2009,the question for me is - would ccp have done this for anyone else? and the answer is obviously no....
3/24/2009,"quoting the rules of a game is wrong? that shows how ignorant you are. ""like bob does"" too bad, ccp shouldnt be choosing favorites over others. a failed alliance is a failed alliance, we can't just bail you out because your too big of a company to fail. /wink wink"
3/24/2009,"mate have they ever rolled back the server?? not even with the pos exploit that happened, and that was a serious problem, i totally get where you are coming from, if you want to be named koukouroukou band of brothers thats a valid request, the mechanics of the game allows you to create any alliance name you want, the function that got bob disolved was a a valid mechanism, right or wrong but it was there, what happened cannot be changed, although ccp must introduce a fix or something because it is really not how disbanding should happen, but you must follow the rules because atm you didn't and that have impact on the rest, you kept sov 3!i for example 2-3 weeks ago i petitioned, to change my alts corp history and delete a corp from the list, that couldn't hurt anybody, yet i got a negative answer stating that characters names and history cannot be changed, iguess the gm was wrong after all. should i petition again? it was pure sentimental value for my alt to just have 1 corp in his history should i be treated differintly?"
3/24/2009,"oh snap, bailout reference. it's on!"
3/24/2009,"while i'm not really a fan of goonswarm, atleast they don't pretend to be some benevolent alliance of loving goody two-shoes and friendly to all like some people assume they should be... they're ****s and that's that...however, this does set a relatively poor precedent once again that ""ccp favors tafkabob"". whether through the action of a rogue gm/dev etc.. (in which this is obviously ""not"" a case of a rogue gm since it was not ""immediately"" rectified"") in which it seems like a sanctioned change specifically for this alliance, with ""less"" of a reason to have their name changed than alliances that accidently made a mistype and have to reform their alliance + fees. kenzoku existed for quite a few months ""before"" the former bob corporations joined into it to start on their sov fest. there was no legitimate petition to be made here, there apparently were no complaints about kenzoku's name until the former bob members joined up at which point they had no standing. they could have easily created a new alliance on the spot with their preferred name costing them an hour of time at most since alliance creation is instantaneous. they did not do this when it was an option because they had supposedly bigger priorities, and now it has turned into a big pr nightmare for ccp because of their actions in helping former bob members. i cannot help but put in my support for this matter as it is an obvious violation of ccp's own ethics to break/bend their rules for a singular or limited entity, regardless of how big or small the slight supposedly was it puts into motion a very slippery slope of events.as a side note.. for those saying (paraphrasing here because quoting every single one of them would use up all my posting space.) ""bob was the first alliance to have this *exploit* (legitimate game mechanic) used on them, so they should be given some leeway"". is a terrible argument for the mere fact that almost the exact same thing happened to maximum yarrage, and if you did any sort of research you would know that."
3/24/2009,please link a post where ccp says that the game mechanic which lead to bob disbanding was unintendedgame mechanic. please link that post or blog and i will go away.
3/24/2009,"yup thats right, i went there."
3/24/2009,"if ccp allowes this to happen for you then ccp is obligated to offer the same service for all eve pilots, character/alliance/corp name changes with just a petition for no apparent reason, if that happens then i have no problem with the status of ken/bobr then i ll vote the name change of yours in a bling"
3/24/2009,"/signedas george orwell said in animal farm, all animals are equal, except the pigs who are a little bit more equal."
3/24/2009,"actually, it isn't. alliances before you have had to change their names by abandoning sov. alliances after you likely will as well. you do not deserve special treatment in any way, shape, or form. i pay the same god damned subscription fee you do."
3/24/2009,haha easily said by the alliance that gets whatever it wants.try being a normal player and asking for favors.
3/24/2009,"heh, ccp does it again."
3/24/2009,"i think they are obligated too.for no apparant reason...there may be a reason. whoever called me ""mister"". i am not."
3/24/2009,"agreed, can you plz petition to change my name to start with a letter other than the first and last 10 of the alphabet plz? because when i started eve i had now idea that just a letter will play such a huge role on how fast i am getting primary and blown up in a fleet battle(valid reason heh)edit: can i have your number? i am a mister"
3/24/2009,"dear god ccp, do you not learn from your past mistakes? again we see ccp is willing to bend their own rules for a favored alliance. the gm who did this is at best, allied to the corp formally known as bob and willing to break their own rules. at worst, he is an idiot who did not consider the ramifications of such a contentious change and should not be doing the job he is doing."
3/24/2009,"poor showing ccp, figured you would have learned from the first time around."
3/24/2009,!
3/24/2009,"i like how the bob guys, who clearly throughout this whole affair have held this game more dearly than most men hold their own families, keep telling those angry at their cheating to grow up, get over it, it's just a game, etc. there's an irony in there somewhere.the people you bob members keep saying ""grow up"" to are by and large not part of an omg elite pvp clan, they probably haven't accrued years on this make believe world, and they sure weren't crying online two months ago because their life's work was destroyed. they're probably by and large like me, people who are not directly affected by this at all, but still find themselves annoyed that the game administrators are so clearly favoring a seemingly random group of beardos by habitually changing the rules in their favor."
3/24/2009,!
3/24/2009,"by your logic, titan bowling was legal and legit, yet your mates still want us banned for that one."
3/24/2009,"in all the hype over the new mission arc, one thing is sorely lacking: consideration of gallente standing. i have a -5.21 gallente navy standing. i had a drop on a mission, an 'invite' to come and run the mission arc. i was gunned down by the gate guns the second i jumped into gallente space. the 'invite' seeding in caldari must stop. most people running missions in caldari will have negative standings with gallente. all this is doing is getting a lot of caldari pilot's ships blown up.i feel betrayed and lied to. everything i read in blogs and forums and chat nothing was ever mentioned about this. all i want is my hawk back and a public notification to everyone in eve warning them of their standings before they attempt this mission!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3/24/2009,"/signedtheir should be a big red sign at the login screen, saying ""when logging into eve, you might lose ships / items / whatever if you dont use your ****ing eyes. do not login if you are not absolutly sure how to read what is written."""
3/24/2009,i'm in support for the mission bit.but the loss of your ship is your own damn fault.check standings next time you fly into an another empires space.
3/24/2009,"i recall the first thing i ever read about arcs stated that they would be across all four empires. if you're at shoot-on-sight standings, you can't do it, and this is fairly well advertised in the information i've seen about epic arcs. now, the arcs are lame in a hundred other ways from all i hear - to my understanding, it's like grinding a l1 agent, except with more flying around and less reward - but -5.21 is your problem, not ccp's."
3/24/2009,"are you referring to that mission where you destroy a single frigate, and you get an item called ""smuggler's warning about sister alitura"" ?the description for that reads:""remember that sisters of eve agent, alitura, who nearly caught our trail? the boss called in some favors and got her reassigned to arnon ix in genesis. the good sister alitura may be resourceful, but she'd need a capsuleer with clearance to all four empires to be any threat, and we know how much the sisters love capsuleers. ""i bolded the relevant bit. doesn't that pretty much tell you that you need good enough standings to do the mission?"
3/24/2009,i brought up the issue long ago.the sheer fact that the epic storyline arc deal is 1 mission. thusly no arc at all. on top of that... people have horrible standings with sisters and/or gallente. where the mission happens.they responded with.. yayayay we will do that soon
3/24/2009,thisa mission that requires people to read.... imagine that!
3/24/2009,this is a good thing.
3/24/2009,"i'd love to see a new forum section, one with a ticker next to it, called ""hide"".a forum section so exclusive, that it would make the forums so much more agreeable to anyone who doesn't really care about why, what, who or when the goons or bob/ken/bobr/whatever had an issue with their bathroom soaps.not to say they only discuss useless issues, or that some things brought up in these discussions aren't valid points, but god damn it, it's turned into something that's worse than a public american election, if it were led by chipmunks and all the votes were counted by who got the most tomato's thrown at them within a given timeframe, while solving a sudoku puzzle.( we all know they couldn't do a sudoku anyway )that's really all i have to say, i don't want to add to the drama, and if you have nothing more to say than bullcrap, then please shut up in here, either you support a new section called ""internal workings"" or ""stationside gossip"" or whichever name they may choose or find to their liking, or you don't.my only motivation to post this is that the alliance discussion boards used to be interesting to read - when like... someone other than the goons or bob had a thread there. ( threads that are majorly more structured and less ""cave-man-esque"" once they hit two pages )quick edit: for those who may have misunderstood, this would be a section for threads about all alliances that have outward drama or babble, not just the two mentioned above."
3/24/2009,"gentlemen of goonzoku reloaded, if you could please relocate your drama to the conveniently roped-off area, it would be much appreciated. sincerely, the managementthumbs-up for caod's existence, and keeping the drama out of the useful forums. thumbs-down for the belief that caod would be useful without the drama - seriously, about the only things you can discuss there are battle reports(which invariably disintegrate into bickering over how it actually went down) and drama. there has to be a cesspool for that stuff, and i'd prefer it all stayed there instead of leaking out."
3/24/2009,i'm sorry the rest of you are so completely uninteresting :(
3/24/2009,sweet... a new quote! (edit: rats... too big for my sig... arg)oh and this + supported (even if it wont happen)
3/24/2009,"if you are referring to the kengokus renaming themselves, it wasnt about alliance drama it was about the rules."
3/24/2009,"that bs about renaming is just the recent news, you really haven't been here enough if you haven't seen the countless annoying and brain-killing threads that pop up regularly.and it's more often goons than bob to be fair, but not like i care, i just would like to see some small inkling of something decently readable for once."
3/24/2009,"it's drama that happens to be about the rules. it's not a nice calm thread of people debating the merits of alliance renaming policy - there are some people doing that, but they're getting drowned out by raging goons, hard-done-by bobs, and flaming alts on both sides. and that's just in the main thread - the ten parody/restatement threads add nothing whatsoever to the discourse except volume, and yet people keep making them. and that's just on the assembly hall!unless something weird happens, this is the last post i'm making on this issue. it's just getting out of hand, and nothing we're discussing is going to help. ccp should explain which of their staff did this and why bob seems to have gotten consideration no other alliance has gotten, and the csm should definitely be involved in the process at some level. but talking in a thread discussing threads parodying threads about the real issue solves nothing. let's stop bumping the ten-thread drama bomb, and get back to discussing the actual issues of the day."
3/24/2009,"im pretty dissapointed in a lot of things about our most recent patch, and im not going to make this a wall of text. graphics:new pos sheilds are ugly as hell. too much to look at/hurts my face. i really liked the old graphic. can a brother get an amen!now all ewar (point/scram/tracking disrupt) looks the same, its flashier and prettier maybe, but again too much to look at. bring the old stuff back pls.sound: the volume gradient relative to the camera and proximity of the ship is much steeper now. kinda sucks if you want to have sound but not be in the face of your ship all the time. please fix.please consider this. leaving some things to the imagination is a good thing. i belive your dev team was going for ""spicing things up"" or something to that effect but to be honest i think a lot of stuff was overdone. if you want to improve graphics, i would do it subtly. why not fix the ""sky"" coloring in starsystems? there has always been that pixelated ugly transition between contrasting colors...and effects? how about making asteroids or stations hard sprites? i.e. they block turret or missiles lol that has always been cheesy.ok im about through, and the reason that i decided to post today is that i have thouroughly enjoyed the game for several years now (thank you ccp and all of the community), but i have seen the development of eve take a turn down a path that i dont like with this most recent patch. this will never be a game for the masses i hope."
3/24/2009,why? just to show your support for the children in the world who have a hard time.
3/24/2009,i'm flipping the main breaker the whole day.hoping for a sunny day as it gets cold here in sweden
3/24/2009,"you seem like you may well have good intentions here, but you picked a bad way of expressing them. this isn't the forum for that sort of thing, unless you're proposing that the csm officially endorse your suggestion of not playing eve to ccp and see if the devs will agree. since that is, rather clearly, not your intent, you may want to move this thread to events & gatherings or maybe eve general, and not the assembly hall."
3/24/2009,you couldn't have picked a worse time to post this... people are going to take this thread the wrong way on so many levels its not even funny.run.. run far and keep running.not supported for reasons i will not get into.
3/24/2009,"no. these kinds of events are stupid and the effort spend 'promoting awareness' could be far better spend making money to give to these underprivileged individuals. i do not see how not playing a game on a particular day will in any way help make their lives better. if you really feel that motivated to help a tiny fraction of the species, then cancel your account and spend the money on charity instead of eve."

3/24/2009,precedent has been set. let the good times roll.also petition to ban puppet masters for being terrible posters.
3/24/2009,notice how the op doesnt actually display the name of his corp nor alliance.oh right it's a nub corp alt. why didnt u post this with your main?
3/24/2009,says the pot calling the kettle black.
3/24/2009,i guess you can only change your alliance name if ccp pilots fly for you. then you can make up whatever rules you want whenever you want.
3/24/2009,"while we're at it, how about ccp stops deleting threads that expose their favoritism?not locking, as per usual. they've been deleted."
3/24/2009,"i'm not defending what ccp did here, but my understanding is that there are more devs who fly for goon than for bobzoku reloaded. it just happens that the sleazeball(or maybe it's the idiot - he did get caught, after all) flew for bob."
3/24/2009,posting in a looser goon alt thread!
3/24/2009,i propose that henceforth any and all threads in assembly hall that have anything to do with in game political bull****... should be deleted..locked..and thrown out of this board.the csm has no business nor does it care to have business with a bunch of damned 5 year olds who have to throw damn fit over every stupid little thing that happens...all of which has utterly nothing to do with the posting of ideas and proposals that help improve the game mechanics and behavior.alliance political power blocs shifting around or changing names has nothing to do with the above.seriously... clean this filth from our boards!
3/24/2009,supported
3/24/2009,"little hint: the csm was originally founded in response to the previous examples of corruption and favouritism towards a particular alliance by a handful of people within ccp. if a single person within ccp has started displaying such favouritism towards that particular alliance again, then this forum is exactly where it should be raised."
3/24/2009,"the first thread on the topic was fine - as nevada said, the csm is as much about transparency as it is about game changes. it's the half-dozen followups that are ****ing me off."
3/24/2009,"i agree to this post... this should stay constructive in this forum, and issues should be raised.if one issue is raised, it doesn't need more threads..."
3/24/2009,then file petitions...this hardly is what i call an effective way to get ccp's attention.
3/24/2009,"that thread has the feel of goonswarm harassing the assembly. 500 supports - most of them don't say anything and are within seconds of each other. this screams bull ****.seriously. i could not care less if an alliance is re-named, especially when no proof has been offered that it was ccp, or anything of the kind. and witch hunts always stink of stupidity.and this place was starting to look so nice and clean..."
3/24/2009,"if you rename an alliance you lose sov. bob/kenny/beaver was renamed, with a name longer than the limit, mind you, without losing sov, so this was done by someone at ccp."
3/24/2009,"what dear ignorant fools. this thread is a good poll of who knows what the hell is even going on in this game, and who has spent their lifetime in empire. maybe you asinine dolts haven't noticed, but changing the name of an space holding alliance has rather serious in-game, sovreignty related ramifications. when kenzoku decided they wanted their old name back, they should have had to disband kenzoku, resetting the sovreignty ticker on their precious few remaining bits of space, but thanks to gm friends they still have within ccp, managed to avoid that little bit of awkwardness. this means that the original poster has no idea what even goes outside the warm, cozy blanket provided by concord."
3/24/2009,this poster would have brains enough to know that posting here like an ass would be a waste of time...and that he should spend his time filing petitions directly to ccp.i guess your not that smart are you.
3/24/2009,"supported. also, ban all goonfleet characters from ever posting ever again.--isaac"
3/24/2009,"except your ""proposal"" starts with the accusation that ccp is directly responsible, and therefore why would you bother coming to the assembly hall to draw the attention of the csm, who are beholden to ccp? oh yeah because you're a vacant ****. goons - the most aptly named alliance in the gaming metaverse.no one here who isn't part of goonswarm gives a flying ****. honestly. try a petition storm, stop wasting the assembly's time."
3/24/2009,"i beg to differ. if you cannot see the possible ramifications of people in power showing favortism towards a minor group then i really cant help you. the csm was actually made for situations like those not for your boring ""nerf caldari"" petitions. in case you havent noticed many empire dwellers such as myself are apalled at the idea of game mechanics being tweaked at my own expense. as was explained there is a hefty price too pay for your name change and the beavers have circumvinted that. nothing is perfect but that doesnt stop anyone to strive for perfection and balanced gameplay is as close as we are going to get. hope that helps."
3/24/2009,"the csm isn't beholden to ccp, it's beholden to the players who vote those people in to their positions. do you even know how a democratic system works?you're right, we have absolutely no proof ccp was involved. except that the name was changed without kenny losing sov, the name is longer than the allowed limit, and the alliance has exactly the same alliance id as kenzoku. other than, you are correct, we have zero reason to believe ccp was involved.maybe some of you should go study what the csm was formed for. here's a hint: it was formed so players could oversee ccp specifically because of situations like this. go read the ny times article about t20 and band of brothers and educate yourselves."
3/24/2009,except for the fact you arrogant pricks obviously forgot that the csm can say all they want... ccp can choose to ignore them.so skip the middle man and make a petition storm.stfu and leave the assembly hall alone and cut the political bull out.
3/24/2009,"i'm sorry that people using the csm for it's intended purpose, upsetting the balance of your precious assembly hall, upsets you so much. you should really relax about it, you're going to hurt yourself."
3/24/2009,we wouldent have to make a stink if ccp followed the goddamn rules. its a dman shame that we players left to police ccp.
3/24/2009,i propose that henceforth any and all threads in assembly hall that are written by the op... should be deleted..locked..and thrown out of this board.this board has no business nor does it care to have business with a terrible poster who has to throw a damn fit over every stupid little thing that happens...all of which has utterly nothing to do with the posting of ideas and proposals that help improve the game mechanics and behavior.whining about threads involving alliance political power blocs shifting around or changing names has nothing to do with the above.seriously... clean this filth from our boards!
3/24/2009,"go back to your hole for now. once this more serious issue is dealt with then you can get back to ""boost ravenn- my raven missllez dont work to good in missions"" posts.also ps, csm is not for proposing ideas. actually that would be the ""features and ideas discussion"". so your attempts at pleading to ccp have all gone unheard for off topic posting in here."
3/24/2009,this is exactly the type of issue the csms should deal with
3/24/2009,remove threads because you don't agree with them. yessiree.<sarcastic thumbs up>
3/24/2009,"actually, that's wrong. the article in nyt is nowhere near right about what the csm is. i suggest that you read the csm paper about what the csm really is."
3/24/2009,"it's a petition thread, and goonswarm is rather known for having a lot of warm bodies, most of whom are capable of following a link and clicking a checkbox. doubly so when you consider that it's getting a lot of support from other bob(bobr? kz? t20?) enemies. the fact that the petition is growing quickly should be no surprise to anyone. it's not malfeasance, it's outrage among an easily-mobilized base."
3/24/2009,"the disgusting thing here is that there are pubbies dumb enough to think that since goons say something they should be against it.drake you're the reason why tafkab was able to get away with their ill-gotten bpos, with their illegitimate motherships, with directors running their capfleets and giving them inside knowledge into pos mechanics. pubbies like you were too busy lining up hoping to join their ranks and cheering them on to realize that when ccp commits acts that destroy the integrity of the game it destroys any magic it has.that ccp still hasn't learned their lesson despite all of this is truely sad. with the current upheaval in 0.0 and the next expansion out, eve should be getting a lot of good press on how exciting the game can be. instead, because they refuse to stop playing favorites with their pet alliance the gaming media is going to go through another cycle of how the company is corrupt, and all of these prior acts are going to be rehashed and ccp's name is going to be deservedly dragged through the mud again.but keep on raging against goonswarm, it just shows how ignorant you are."
3/24/2009,"its a good thing i didnt have to read the op to understand that youre an idiot. you should stop posting this worthless crap here and go back to cnp or some other part not looked at, if you refuse to stop posting that is."
3/24/2009,this has nothing to do with goonswarm you jackass.read the damn post.... oh wait... your too busy clicking a link and following the mob.but since everyone is actually responding to me i guess i struck a nerve.keep it coming.... your responding is actually making you look worse!keep on beating that war drum and wasting your time here!why listen to me.... if i'm such a pathetic troll... why give me the attention?
3/24/2009,it's a good thing i don't listen to alts.
3/24/2009,"please post a link to where you supported this thread and not how you read it and instantly posted this one. we'll wait all night if you're having problems finding your post.but seriously though, go whine about t2 cruises in ship and modules or whatever it is that you do and leave this forum for what it was originally designed for, a place for players to hold ccp accountable for its actions."
3/24/2009,a bloo bloo! a bloo bloo bloo!
3/24/2009,i fully support that position!
3/24/2009,"to the op, try to imagine for a second that this is nothing to do with goons or the-alliance-formerly-known-as-kenzoku-formerly-known-as-bob. i should also point out that i am nothing to do with either alliance or their allies.since the dawn of the alliance mechanic, the naming policy has been the same as corporations and characters. afaik, no name changes have ever been allowed, and petitions have been ignored because those were the rules. the reasons are pretty obvious, constant name changing could be exploited. as a result, if you want to rename something you start again. that means, new n00b character, disband/reform corporation or disband/reform alliance.the latter, as has been pointed out many times on these forums now, has several nasty consequences for the alliance being ""renamed"". there's the isk cost of setting up an alliance, and the loss of sov in any systems the former alliance held. that bob""r"" has effectively circumvented a system that is in place for all other eve inhabitants is annoying. it's rather like me wanting to form a 0.0 alliance and being given several systems with sov 3 ""for free"".so far, arguments for the change have revolved around, ""i don't like what goon did to bob, so it's justified to allow the name change,"" or, ""goonies annoy me, so their tears are justified."" i find these arguments wanting for two reasons:1) goons' disbanding of bob was done using in-game mechanics and rules (technically, it was bob who disbanded themselves via a rogue director). the fact that the rules allow for such a dramatic take down is not the fault of those who use them to that end.2) lack of objectivity means that we can't ever be sure we're on a level playing field. if rules can be circumvented on a whim, then what's to say it won't be your alliance/corp/char whatever that's on the receiving end when an enemy of yours gets an unwarranted boost? this is the reason people should keep a very close eye on stuff like this."
3/24/2009,wrong. ccp has changed names if people capitalized a name wrongly or something like that.
3/24/2009,"who? i've seen a lot of posts from people complaining that tweaks like that weren't granted when they petitioned. furthermore, is bobr a recapitalisation of ""kenzoku""? i seriously doubt that i would be allowed to change my char name in such a way."
3/24/2009,"from another forum:""stian empire was created. someone noticed the typo, told ccp. ccp told them to disband the alliance (and getting no refund from the 1b isk needed to create it), recreate the alliance (and once again pay 1b isk to create it) and make sure to spell the name correctly.black 0ut was created. someone realized how dumb this was, and so they asked ccp to change it to black out. ccp told them no, and that they'd have to disband the alliance (and get no refund from the 1b isk needed to create it), recreate the alliance (and once again pay 1b isk to create it) and make sure to spell the name the way they wanted to.against all authorities had a slight mishap where someone didn't pay the maintenance build. they lost all their sovereignty, had to recreate the alliance, and had to once again front the 1b isk fee. ccp did not reimburse any of that.corps from a defunct alliance known as band of brothers join an alliance called kenzoku. they ""fight"" under the name kenzoku for over a month and a half. they then ask ccp to change their name to band of brothers reloaded and ccp does so, without making them disband the alliance or pay a 1b isk fee.""edit: also stain allaince- and initiative associates were told that they weren't special enough to get their names changed"
3/24/2009,"backing up the above post, our alliance also disbanded once due a forgotten alliance bill and we had to recreate our alliance for the 1 bil fee. if they now suddenly give bob special rights then i want a 1 bil reimbursement for our alliance.back on the op post, 1 topic should have been enough the others should have been closed or moved to coad by a mod."
3/24/2009,sigh in game in forum harassment is also banable :( did you think about that.
3/24/2009,"looks like the oposition is having a little trouble coming up with reasons to keep going.ironic aint it.look... i don't deny that something obviously went wrong...but spraying all that crap all over assembly hall like a bunch of damned kids foaming at the mouth is not only immature but practically degrading to whom they represent.every bloody day i see ""goons are bad"" and ""bob is (was) bad"".you know what... i'm starting to agree with them.... all i see day in and day out is spamming... ego trips.... stupidity.... snobbery.... you guys cant even keep it real let alone serious... your just a damn mob that changes its tune every 5 seconds.you can't even hold an argument without pulling bs out of your asses.ive said it once and i'll say it again... you wan't to complaint? petition it.i'm sorry... you will get nothing from csm.... zero... zilch...nada.all they will do is have a discussion and if ccp says no... its no.waste of bloody time.... and then you'll make a bloody damn fool of yourself in posting in a ridiculously stupidly long thread that is obviously ignored.like ghost training... and nerfing missiles.... all your doing is making yourselves to be the biggest damned idiots that ever graced the forums...all for naught.so stop wasting our time and actually do something about it.make petitions or quit the frakking game....theres no other way to get ccp's attention more effectively."
3/24/2009,"hear hear, drake. agree 100%."
3/24/2009,what rules?
3/24/2009,"you guys truly make me laugh. this is ccp's game. it is not your game. it has never been your game. it is ccp's game. if ccp decided that bob was allowed a name change, then ok, they get it. but this is so ridiculous. your all having a hissy fit about a damn name. get over it. it won't affect the change of the war between goons. this is favoritism in the least possible way. its a stupid name change. bob didn't win its wars because ccp helped them. if they had, bob wouldn't be at its death door by goonswarm. in fact, ccp (if they truly favored bob) would have given their territory back. free of charge. but they didn't. they changed a name. big freaking deal.get over it. i wouldn't give a dang if i were in goons or bob. so a gm decided to get involved in the game. you all cry about gms not being more in the game and then, then, when they do something, you all pull a hernia crying about it. end of story and end of thread.--isaac"
3/24/2009,this.yes i admit that its a contradiction of policy... but its just a f'ing name change people.there wheren't given anything of value other than a damn name change.get over yourselves.it would be different if it was something more significant.in all honesty i would think it would be appropriate for ccp to grant a valid name change request like a mis-spelling or a name that is free of anything inapropriate.but all this screaming over a name change?you people need to get a life. wrong or right... i can think of worse things to scream over.
3/24/2009,"people don't care about the bobr name, what people care about is that they were allowed to change it without going through the usual route of disbanding their alliance, losing sov3 in their remaining systems and paying 1 billion isk to create a new alliance with their preferred name. there are many examples in all these ""whine threads"" where alliances were refused permission to change their name, and were told to go through the process i mentioned previously.as a result, the alliance-formerly-known-as-kenzoku-formerly-known-as-bob has effectively been given 1 billion isk and sov 3 status in multiple systems. i'm sure the other alliances who never had that priviledge are very happy at this so-called fair treatment.so far the arguments against have been of the ""goons hax0r3d bob so deserve what they get"" or ""it's only a name"", thus demonstrating point-missing of epic proportions."
3/24/2009,then make a damn petition and stop clogging up the boards.i don't have a problem with the complaint... i have a problem with the jackasses that scream in spite of the fact they could have filed a petition and left it at that.
3/24/2009,"it's not just about a name change...it's also about:1) mechanics abuse. usually, an alliance that changes its name loses all sov and must pay 1 billion isk to reorganize. that's a lot of money, whether you're involved in corporations or not.2) the larger issue of fairness. frankly, all players should want to have the assurance that they're playing in a game that isn't crooked.you guys on both sides keep making this a ""carebear vs. alliance ***"" issue, but it's actually something all players should be worried about."
3/24/2009,"snipped someimho:you will never have certainty that the game isn't rigged. human beings are (in large enough numbers) going to have a few who break the rules. that is a certainty. asking for a large corporation (ccp) to be 100% honest, 100% of the time, is naive (again, imho). you want to really get ccp's attention, you will cancel your account - en mass. complaining on the boards will probably (imho) accomplish nothing.getting 2500 people to cancel accounts, even temporarily, will make them sit up and take notice. if you can get an entire (unnamed) 0.0 alliance to cancel for one day - that would get the accountants and administrators on the case of the gm's/developers to fix this now!otherwise, welcome to gm/devs eve-online... and don't be surprised when it goes to ppoop!no, i have no affiliation with any 0.0 entity, yes, this is my main, no i don't work for ccp... ________________"
3/24/2009,"no this is a goons vs the assembly issue. ever since this issue has been raised, all of a sudden a rash of bs. threads. have. popped. up. all. over. the. board., forcing several good ideas down out of sight.(and the ones i'm linking to are only a sample. some have moved down through the pages, and some have been locked.)i'm all for correcting errors, but overwhelming the system with aggressive overbearing whining is more than a little irritating to those of us who use this board regularly to push game changes."
3/24/2009,this.op is an idiot.
3/24/2009,it seems to be ****ing the goons off. and that is all good in my book.
3/24/2009,"am i detecting trace amounts of irony? after all, your remedy for this rash of threads which so aggravates you is the ""report"" link. for some reason though, you have decided to create a thread of your own to expound on your ideas. i read it and was unable to find any of the following:it's ok though. despite what many people say, the assembly hall is for seeking attention as much as for suggesting changes to game mechanics. don't be a self-hating attention junkie."
3/24/2009,completely unsupported. csm is about taking issues to ccp. not just bugs or such.
3/24/2009,an issue is an issue. as long as the proposed idea of the thread is suggesting changing the game in a way ccp could implement.
3/24/2009,also... isnt this thread in of itself ironic because it's whining about such things? doing exactly what you dont want to happen in the beginning?
3/24/2009,i dont understand why people hate goons so much.they have been highly good for the game. newbie training vids accessible by everyone.etc etc. goons/bob/anyone should full well have access to post their issues in the game. even if you disagree or something.
3/24/2009,good thing i don't listen to *******s who post with alt's and has a serious lack of intelligence about himself.
3/24/2009,the only irony here is you proving my point with your foolish attempts at diverting attention from the problem.how many threads have i actually started in assembly hall?that's what i thought.i rest my case.
3/24/2009,your an idiot for misidentifying the csm as being ccp itself or having any power over said action.as i have said time and time again.... ccp can choose to ignore anything the csm says.get it through your frakking thick skull. it will hurt less.
3/24/2009,"this has nothing to do with me hating goons other than the obvious lack of brainpower emanating form there end of the galaxy.my problem is this mob mentality crap is bull**** and needs to stop making a mess of the boards.it is one thing to post a protest in a singular thread.it is an another to start proposing stupid assed proposals in disbanding each other and compounding that fact with more stupidity.top that off with over half of the individuals participating in this are not even supporting but doing so ""illegitimately"" by playing a sarcastic attitude game which makes the whole point of giving support pointless and insulting."
3/24/2009,post with your main idiot.
3/24/2009,"you're one to talk when it comes to insulting. the fact is that your thread differs only by a matter of degree from this ""problem"" you so have done such an amusing job of exaggerating. name me one occurrence in this thread of:furthermore, why didn't you just report the offending threads and move on? not that i object to this thread. far from it, in fact. i'm just trying to gain an insight into the reasoning that reached the end conclusion that this thread would be any different than what it rants so vehemently against.the fact that you've never done it before is irrelevant. every attention junkie has their entrance."
3/24/2009,"here's the thing: you're 100% right that there should have, at most, been one single thread. the fact some people are overzealous does not negate the issue, and is why there is a moderation team (or mitnal, who is a masochist, but a team unto himself). this is hardly the first time multiple threads with the same content have been made, nor will it be the last.the reason people are saying you are making it a goon issue is probably because you are being extremely rage-ish. it would be one thing if you could link me to all your other posts where you heavily berated people for making a thread similar to ones already in existence- maybe you have? i don't know, nor would anybody else just happening across your posts.the point is this: it is a valid issue that has more ramifications than the issue itself.what i mean:there is the issue of the event - that the alliance name was changed without penalty and against the rules set forth and enforced in the past, regardless of your belief that a company can break its own eula but hold their audience culpable to it. this event is of course the event in question, and is the main focal point. it has, assuredly, been petitioned many times already. this event's consequences need to be directed at those that abused the system - that would be the alliance.but there is the other event, which may sound very similar - that an alliance name was changed without penalty and against the rules set forth and enforced in the past, etc. this event is directed at ccp itself, not the alliance. it just so happens that the two events are identical in nature, and so when posting about it, they are going to, by default, be intertwined. the consequences of this event need to be directed at ccp.both events are the same, but uniquely different."
3/24/2009,"finally... someone who uses there head before they speak.a: i don't believe its ok for a company to violate its own eula... that's just flat wrong. now whether that this particular area is covered or not depends entirely on the eula and ccp's judgement call.however... a name change is not exactly earth shattering... if the compromised in favor of one then they should give favor to others.b: the whole point of my yelling/ranting/raving at not just goons but every damn idiot who has to stand on there little soap boxes is they think petitioning the csm for answers is the answer... is flat stupid.i support the csm in there efforts of representation.... but somehow i strongly disagree that they are going to amount to a hill of beans on this particular issue.your trying to get ccp's attention... then why the hell mess with the middle man?surely you people are capable of speaking for your bloody selves!c: i am a troll... one with brains and many years of experience in the world of gaming (eve being one of many) i have issues in being nice as every time i turn around some idiot shows up and posts without using his damn brain and expects results only to get blasted by myself or any one of a few ""legitimate"" trolls around that actually give a damn about this game.im am neither pirate...carebear... or 0.0 based.i'm none of the above.... because this game can't be one of any kind.... it must be all kinds.i undersatnd the underlying balance necessities of the game and i will be first to admit i am no expert on any particular area but alot of it is just plain common sense.yes.... someone at ccp likely frakked up.but turning the assembly hall into a damn circus is not what i call a smart move...no one will ever treat a goon seriously let alone with any credability becuase you keep pushing these things:1: your bigger than everyone else2: you don't give a #### about what everyone else thinks because your bigger than everyone else3: you never treat anything with seriousness because you can afford to take a hit without flinching4: you can call in 100's of people to do the same ting without recourse"
3/24/2009,5: and to top it off... you people refuse to listen let alone give any quater because your bigger than everyone else.goonswarm has the power of intimidation... you can afford to have stupid people flying all over the place...and it wont take a many to achieve that.bob is guilty of the same thing.you guys scream the most... you trash the place the most... you spam the most... you scam the most.everyone has it out for you guys.and yet you expect to be heard...and treated just like everyone else?just stop and think about that for a moment.oh sure you can pull up my posts and point out all the stuff i've said.but i pale in comparsion to the toltality of what your alliance has said/stated/done in the history of this game.i try my damndest to remember that not all goons/bobs are alike..and there are a few who are actually decent people.. like you.but its getting just a bit hard to wipe the crap off my boot every time i step into these forsaken dump of a forum board thats getting overran with this insanity.so forgive me for being a little terse if not blunt.i appreciate the fact you respect my position... i respect yours as well.so do something about it... and try the direct approach... and leave the assembly hall out of this mess.

3/24/2009,"did my first titan cyno today. what an absolutely bugged system.firstly anyone who does cyno. is going to be sent flying. falcon, arazu, and kestral all get blown away. sent flying.second any ship bumped in this manner. has a fair possibility of ending up in an exploitative nature.thirdly... anything jumped or near the titan when jumped. will be sent at least 80km. nyx went 80km.how about as part of the sov-alliance boost/fix expansion. cynos get fixed for these modern fleets."
3/24/2009,i have no idea what you are on about.what happened? =\
3/24/2009,did you jump the titan right on top of those ships?
3/24/2009,this is an issue with normal capitals jumping at the same time aswell. it is in the patchnotes for apocrypha 1.0.2

3/24/2009,"i have an alt id really like to sell, but i'll be ****ed if its this that makes me get a credit card =0there's no reason we shouldn't be able to pay for character transfers the same way we can pay for the rest of eve."
3/24/2009,"yes, i realize people have needs for escapes. however, to be frank, i still don't see the need of this feature. priorities.--isaac"
3/24/2009,i think the reason a credit card is needed is to prove the seller is the owner of the account. it's also the reason why the seller always has to pay the fee. using plex's removes that safeguard.
3/24/2009,"supported, please if u cant use a plex, make a similar npc trade good thingy to a plex that deals with transfer."

3/24/2009,hehe
3/24/2009,"removing the 1 billion isk from them is just us expecting ccp to treat them exactly like they would treat any other alliance wanting a rename. in the long run it won't make much difference.however as they now hold some sov 3 systems, the sov reset will hurt them a lot more as they will lose their cyno jammers again."

3/24/2009,"i happen to like the new look for the minmatar ships, myself. the orange lighting details and intricate non-sprite frameworks and scafolds stunned me so much that i spent five minutes switching between my ships seeing how cool they looked now. if anything, they look better, and even a bit sturdier (i can now believe my tempest will not pull an enterprise-d on me every time the armor takes a cruise missle, with that second support and all)."
3/24/2009,"for the most part, i like the premium client (especially with how they fixed the scythe/scimitar, which imo previously challenged the moa for the ugliest ship in the game on classic). i like the classic mastodon/mammoth a little more than the new, but only marginally. in general, i'd prefer to keep the new look minnie's have in premium."
3/24/2009,considering i play with a friend whos been playing this for years (hes the one teaching me) and he saw me buy the ship and have it not appear in my inventory its not something im making up this is something im sure others are experiencing as well even if they dont post about it and part of my problem is that my ingame petitions arent getting answered even a week later so it occurs to me that it is a pretty big issue am i just supposed to not bring it up? not supposed to talk about an issue im having like it doesnt exist when it stops me from playing the game... if your not posting something helpful to somebodies problems your part of said problem cause your just causing aggrivation whats the point of saying anything at all? just cause you can? in which case why shouldnt i...
3/24/2009,"petition times are slow after a big patch, but i understand your frustration. that said, you'd do better to ask in market discussions, new citizens q+a, or issues workarounds and localization, or even eve general, than in assembly hall - find out if there's a known problem, and if there's a simple solution, rather than asking the csm to bring your bug report to iceland and meet with half the dev team about it in august. i'm not saying your problem is illegitimate, i'm saying that you're trying to use a body that really isn't suited to fixing it."

3/24/2009,"i am a 31 year old humanities student living in the uk. i've been active in eve for nearly four years now and have some experience in many areas of eve. whilst not professing to be an expert in any one area i believe my wide experience will help to serve the general population of eve and bring what they want to the attention of ccp. at all times i try and maintain a neutral stance and believe the subject areas i study help me to achieve this whilst still being passionate about the game. i have applied for candidacy on the csm as i feel, if elected, i have the time and enthusiasm to make a difference alongside whomsoever else gets voted into the csm. i would like to give others the chance to be as enthralled by this game as i have been and still am. whilst trying to maintain an open mind i do have some areas in which i have a strong opinion in. these are small gang/solo pvp which i think has mostly been overlooked for some time now by the developers. i would like to see some effort being directed to non-sovereign infrastructure solutions such as mobile refineries, mobile research and mobile production facilities beyond what is available now. with the advent of wormhole space i think the need for this is greater than ever before. lastly, as you can expect from my corp ticker, i am interested in the backstory of eve and player interaction with it. i would like to see more development done that tie in the standard day to day actives of your average eve player with the vast scope of prime fiction that ccp has at its disposal. this includes ideas such as widening the scope of the newly introduced epic mission arcs to include pirate and sub factions as well as simply providing more information ingame available to anyone who is interested in where they live, what they do and how these things came about. i am interested in the availability of background information as an in game asset rather than pushing this on people as i know full well many people enjoy this game without immersing themselves in the storylines and instead writing their own story for themselves. if you have any question please feel free to contact me ingame or on here and i will do my best to answer you as promptly as possible."
3/24/2009,a great candidate for csm. very knowledgeable about the game of eve online with a flair for discussion and constructive debate. heartstone has been a regular at fanfest and player-arranged meets and will bring a lot of grass-roots player representation to the role if he is elected.enthusiastically supported.
3/24/2009,"hi everyone!as an elected member of the first csm i feel the time has come for me to run a second time. my character is an achura female who started in eve online over two and half years ago as a student at eve university - new edens largest new player training corporation. over time i became an instructor, recruiter and eventually a director at eve university.the person behind dierdra vaal is valentijn geirnaert, a 24 year old dutch computer science student from the netherlands with a focus on game design. i was an elected member of the first council of stellar management in 2008. i am running for a second term now because i believe i have the right ideas about the direction the game needs to take. on top of that, i strongly feel that if you want something done right you have to do it yourself.instead of writing a really long post on what i stand for i will simply refer you to my website."
3/24/2009,i would like to be the first to say good luck in your campaign dierdra. you did a smashing job last time round. my own time in eve university was a happy and worthwhile one and it's people like you that help to make eve that little bit easier on the new players who come through your doors.

3/24/2009,"to summarise briefly, you whined about being war-decced by goonswarm after being elected, pathetic. to follow on from that, you seem to have no idea what you're talking about. in short, you're a poor csm who probably only got in by block vote from your alliance."

3/24/2009,"why on earth would i have supported that since that certainly isn't something the folks i try to represent would want? do you have any idea what a constituency is? err maybe if i said i had a constiuanz?my ""big"" coalition of ""friends"" on the council?? yeah, got me there, most of my friends are people i don't know and have never met....

3/25/2009,its true. the old capital jump effects were way better.the new one just sucks. to be honest i think they didnt put any effort into it and just rushed for expansion.
3/25/2009,signed
3/25/2009,"almost all effects has waves type =/ jumps, sensor booster etc. old style jumps was more ""interesting"" and a bit more epic or so"
3/25/2009,im agree
3/25/2009,"i agree, current jump effects are just to plaina stargate simply uses an allready existing wormhole to jump a ship through, jumpdrives wreck a hole on the fabric of space (as in, create a new wormhole) this demands a more epic fx"
3/25/2009,i also agree that the new graphic for a capital jumping in and out from point a to point b is very dull and doesn't impress even new players that want a capital. i love the graphic myself and especially with a titan jumping to destination system can give a chilling effect to a doomsday imminent on a hostile force on the other end with the cyno or the jump bridging of bs and support ships to the destination.
3/25/2009,do something about it... it is ugly now.
3/25/2009,"even as i write this it feels absurd to say so, but the old effect when a ton of caps or fleet jumped/bridged in was ""whoooohoooo here we go"".don't get that feeling now and that's a bit of a shame.give back the irrationality of real life adrenaline on seeing a special effect.zos"

3/25/2009,"this season, i will mostly be supporting this thread."
3/25/2009,"agreed. but the faction stuff should req the same skills as t2, and the officer modules should require the max skills of t2 (for a launcher officer, it should req the specialized skill at lvl 5.the better the mods/ships the higher the skill req should be.but the t2 ammo shouldn't have the nerfs reduced, just their dmg boosted( big penalty, and big bonus too use)"
3/25/2009,"i'm not a minnie pilot, and i don't know any minnie pilots who use barrage, but i acknowledge that it likely has some utility sometimes. thing is, look at what ship would generally use it. when i think of a ship that wants long falloff on its acs, i think of a vagabond or something similar, that likes fighting in the 15-20 km range, to put a point on the enemy and stay out of web/scram range. those ships are naturally speed-fit, to be able to hold the range against slower enemies. how well does a fast-orbiting ship do when you nerf its tracking? people who fight in falloff tend to need their tracking quite a lot. actually, it was strill who said the line you quoted, and me who made about the same points you just did. thing is, i acknowledge that a handful of slight advantages do not offset the stonking big disadvantages void has except in some incredibly niche situations. it's not good as a whole, even if some aspects of it are. and since you can't fire half a shot, that means that void is bad. sure, if you know exactly how the combat is going to play out, maybe it's better, but the thing about combat is that you don't - battle plans go out the window at first contact with the enemy, and all that. also, who trains weapon spec skills to 5? that's just crazy."

3/25/2009,"(yorda is forum banned for another few weeks :( )after flying the nidhoggur for over a year now and discovering just how awesome triage is (it is really sexy) i'm pretty happy with the nidhoggur. the nag on the other hand has no redeeming features and is a worthless pile of ****. i'm fully speced for it and refuse to buy one as it's a complete waste of money. it needs something other than it's insanely long training time. if i could change one thing about training on yorda i would of trained for the rev instead of the nag, been done training sooner, have a good dread, and probably be able to fly amazing amarr battleships by now.motherships are a whole separate issue, i never leave my carrier and have plenty of alts so that i rarely need to dock but yet i'd still never buy a mothership. it's just not worth putting a giant bullseye over your head and not be able to hotdrop or triage. i'd rather lose a few handfuls of carriers."
3/25/2009,edit: stupid eve-o
3/25/2009,any news if ccp are gonna pull their thumbs out their arse and fix the damn nag?
3/25/2009,"i never understood why they made missile batteries that way in the first place. if keeping them online while they have a cpu use isn't technically doable (it most likely is, sounds more like a question of effort) the simple fix is to make them take no cpu and decrease caldari tower total cpu. that would make them less useful as high sec lab platforms and useable in low/no sec. the first solution is preferable, but either way something has to change."
3/25/2009,"even though the emoragers are flooding the assembly hall with bullcrap posts about alliance renaming (go back to caod, whiners) and pushing legitimate issues to the bottom, i think this still merits attention.once again, what exactly does it take to get a csm to even acknowledge this exists?"
3/25/2009,"i would like this really, would eliminate some confusion"
3/25/2009,"well, it has been a while since the last time i got killed because of 0.0 gate blockades. i've made an effort to never warp in a straight line in occupied sytems out of high sec since then.i was in a 0.0 corp once, but not for long, i joined alongside a friend, didn't learn much about them, took a break from the game for a few months, got kicked out for inactivity, and to this day i still have 2 cruisers in their hangars which i don't feel like getting back.i mean, really, noone even gave a damn about my questions when i logged in that fine day, and procedded to fly a shuttle around until i was finally caught and blown up just before re-entering 0.1 space.all i have left to say about that is it's fortunate clones get shipped back to somewhere friendlier when in a station one isn't allow to be in."

3/25/2009,are we talking the virtual burning of tobacco to create a smoke that can be inhaled by a person to get their nicotine hit in public which in many countries is illegal. or a virtual ecig? ( aka electronic cigarette) which is legal in rl.just a thought ( and dont have many of them )al thorr
3/25/2009,"yea, remind ccp so they don't forget to remove it next patch just like they did quafe girl"
3/25/2009,boosters are higher on the offensive scale and there's no way they'll take them out when they already got their t rating for the boxed set which was the whole point of removing the quafe girl. cigs are safe for the foreseeable future.
3/25/2009,"with all the wanton murder, **** and pillaging in the game, anything to help chill the virtual mind and soul is only appropriate and welcome. how do you define ""need"" anyway?"

3/25/2009,a fine puff of whatever it is people want to smoke is a good thing imo. i myself would live a fine cigar and a snifter of cognac between missions...
3/25/2009,"i was actually referring to the amount of time it took ccp to actually give them a purpose. granted, they do need a slight nerf at the moment, but it took ages for ccp to get around to boosting them.agreed.minor? how can you say minor if weapon balance issues are currently half of why amarr are far too powerful? you're contradicting yourself.the current low sec changes have done nothing to fix low sec. ccp themselves have admitted that low sec needs help. the majority of the problem is the completely worthless ore there when compared to high sec. rats have essentially nothing to do with the problem.i'm referring to huge influx of minerals from drone space that unbalance the current economics of minerals. look at the value/deamnd of trit versus supply.perhaps you should actually read the nighthawk thread and try to understand the numbers and math involved. the nighthawk's tank/buffer is hardly superior to what other command ships can fit as well. gank? what the hell are you talking about?! the dps of the nighthawk is awful. expect to have tank and gank? perhaps you should actually read the nighthawk thread and learn some math before you start running your mouth. i provide very solid evidence and numbers that the nighthawk indeed has a serious pg issue. it's all in that thread. respond there if you'd like. all the arguments are there for you to read if you'd take the time before responding.however, this thread isn't about any of the above particular issues. the only topic of this thread is the amount of time it takes for ccp to respond to any given issue... even issues that they've admitted are problematic. why is it ccp moves so slowly on balance issues? we're not talking weeks or months here. we're talking years in some cases."
3/25/2009,"as it says to be honest, never seen the need for them back in 2003 and do not see any need for them now (other than for e-peen), as far as i'm concerned they have no place in eve and any of the arguements i have heard to support them have lacked any real substance and all lead back to what i said earlier (more e-peen).if people want kill stats then they should go play unreal tournament or something.just my opinion of course, but i'd like to think anyone that is a true eve'er will support this idea.thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------"
3/25/2009,"if you don't like them, you can ignore them. me, i like them."
3/25/2009,"force new players to leave starter npc corps after a certain reasonably short character age and either form/join a player corp or be moved to a new npc corp, against which it's possible to wage a concord sanctioned war. players, leaving player run corps, are automatically moved to the same new npc corps."
3/25/2009,in before the flames!
3/25/2009,supported.
3/25/2009,op should learn to read before making the same damn proposal for the 1000th time.
3/25/2009,the game needs something like thistoo many people hide in npc corps.
3/25/2009,"yes, of course players should be forced to play the game in the fashion you prefer. after all, what's the point of a sandbox if people are allowed to play in it differently? no. this idea isn't any better the 500th time than it was the first."
3/25/2009,"so, we now have people who are what, 3 months old, and working on mining suddenly able to be mass wardecked into oblivion? come on, ccp isn't that stupid.if you don't like people in npc corps, give them a reason to leave it and join your alliance/corporation. don't whine to the devs about forcing people down a path they wouldn't like to take. i'm in npc corp so i can help the newer players, and you're asking me to leave it because you can't wardec to your heart's content?epic fail."
3/25/2009,not supported for the 1000th time.
3/25/2009,"i obviously support my own proposal.npc corps have a distinct advantage compared to player run corps - being in one entitles a character to practically unlimited risk-free income, ""balanced"" with practically zero possibility for isk or ship loss. this is unfair to players, who choose to join a player run corp.another consequence of the loss free gameplay style is that npc corp players gain unfair advantage in the industry sector - they can afford to produce and sell goods under the cost, with the excuse ""minerals/datacores that i obtain myself are free"". potential loses would let them make more reasonable business decisions.npc corps prevent a multitude of useful gameplay options: - disrupting enemy[1] industry - disrupting enemy[1] supply lines - retaliation against ""ninja salvagers"" (more commonly known, incorrectly, as ""salvage-thieves"") - retaliation against scammers, market gougers or just plain competitorsi'm sure there are more inventive people out there, who can think of other possibilities.does this proposal create imbalance or unfairness?no.new players have a choice - either join a player run corp and be equal in all respects to other players, who joined a player run corp, or join a wardec-able npc corp and be exposed exactly to the same risks as other players.new players, should they choose so, are, of course, allowed to enjoy the safety of highsec and starter npc corps for a reasonable amount of time - until they are deemed to not be in distinct disadvantage compared to older players due to not knowing the game.does this proposal forces a particular gameplay style.no.being in an wardec-able npc corp does not prevent any carrier, that was possible in a starter npc corp. a miner can continue to pursue his mining carrier. an explorer can continue to explore. a pirate can continue to kill. a mission runner can continue to run missions. an industrialist, a trader, a scammer all can continue to play exactly as before.only while being exposed to the same risks.[1] ""enemy"" means either or both of ""enemy corp/alliance"" or ""individual enemy player"""
3/25/2009,"some replies:drake draconis, i assure you i can read and write reasonably well.herschel yamamoto, npc or wardec-able npc corp does not prevent any particular style of gameplay, preferred by me or not.bunyip, i'm not sure what point are you trying to make, that certain professions and players ought to be privileged?"
3/25/2009,"correct me if i'm wrong, but if a pilot is out in space doing his thing, anyone that wants too can come along and shoot that pilot. if a pilot is sitting in a sation doing his thing, no matter what corp he is in, no one can do anything to him, even if he is in a dec'd corpbeing in an npc corp does not prevent other players whacking that player. what you want is the ability to go after high security pilots without consequences. you want to dec the larger corps in the game so you can go after pilots that have no desire for pvp and will barely be able to defend themselves.and lets be honest here, all 0.0/lowsec pilots have some sort of alt to do their market work for them. if you vote for forcing highsec players into decable corps then you should also vote for allowing one single account and one single pilot for everyone playing the game to truely level the playing field."
3/25/2009,you can read and write? good for you.so i guess its a severe lack of intelligence and foresight.did you actually check the forums to see the other exact same proposals and there answers?did you actually bother to research this instead of emo-raging on npc's?did you actually think this through to the point of evaluating balance or are you just interested in padding your kills?yup... figured that.think...before you post.
3/25/2009,"a player in an npc corp can't be wardeced, but they also have disadvantages - they can't issue a wardec, they can't anchor a pos, they can't rent a station office for extra tabs, they can't use a corp wallet for extra tabs(more relevant than the last, because there are no station containers for isk), they can't issue corp contracts to up the contract cap from 21 to 81, and so on. also, your proposal fails another critical test - how many wardecs do you expect there to be on caldari provisions as soon as it becomes a decable corp? having npc corps that can be wardeced means that it is utter suicide to be forced out of the base corp, because you can expect dozens or hundreds of highsec pirates to keep permanent decs on those corps, for the free kills of players who don't know that they've just been dropped from safety into what might as well be 0.0 space. so i want to have items scattered about without the ability for a ceo to pay a few million and spy on my hangars. or maybe i like helping new players out, and prefer to spend my time in corp chat giving them pointers. or i'm paranoid of people i don't know, and assume that player corps are just traps for the unwary and the ceos will scam you mercilessly(yes, i've known people who thought that). or, god forbid, i just want to pay ccp $15/month to mission in peace and not have to worry about corp mails, corp ops, corp drama, and yes, wardecs. eve is not the safest of games, of course, but it isn't defined by the gank alone either. yes, the bear is an unfashionable creature, but we shouldn't just throw them all out, and even if we should, ccp never would for financial reasons. it's just not going to happen."
3/25/2009,"i think it's fine the way it is. if npc corps offer such huge advantages, why are a higher percentage of veteran players not in them?"
3/25/2009,also keep in mind that about 75% of those npc'ers are not npc'ers but alts of mains who are in corps and or 0.0.duh...
3/25/2009,force every player to mine the first hour they are logged. why? i love the pvpers tears. go searching your easy kills another way.
3/25/2009,"ravenesa, i can't see how you comments are relevant to the discussion. you point similarities between npc corp players and non-npc corp players. there's nothing wrong with that. what is wrong is the privilege of npc corp players.drake draconis, your comments is nothing, but flaming. please, grow up and/or go to flame elsewhere.herschel yamamoto, what you describe is easily solvable by creating your own corp, which is one of my points - join a player corp (possibly your own) or a war-decable npc corp.boknamar, i don't know whether what you say is true or not, so i can't comment on it. if it's true, it may be due to the fact that ""veteran"" players are ones, who came to the game before it went half the way to world of evecraft.drake, yes i keep that in mind, in fact i have pointed out that it's not possible to attack such alts, thus harming their 0.0 mains.venkul mul, what you propose is forcing a particular profession to players, unlike me. also, please, refrain from personal attacks. especially when a simple check on my killboard and the killboards of all the corps and alliances i have been will show you a negligible percent of empire kills. it just makes you look like a stupid child."
3/25/2009,"you try to force a kind of play stile you like to other players and then get offended when some retort your proposal against you?i think the one that need to grow is you. your idea has been suggested and soothed down hundred of times. nothing has changed from the last time it was refused, but you feel the need to repeat it again and pretend to be taken seriously. the only reason to propose it is to get easy empire targets without loss of standing. as it has been showed in all the others thread it is easy for macro/sweatshop farmers/transport alt and c. avoid the consequences of being wardecced. so this suggestion only result would be to get easy targets in high sec. if you don't know that it mean you haven't searched what was already written on this topic."
3/25/2009,"not supported for the same reasons i didn't support this the last time it was proposed, and the time before that, and the time before that, and..."
3/25/2009,"not sure if this has been thought of but:because a point is mandatory in any pvp encounter and due to alot of ships are limited to 2 mids, sacrificing a rig slot to add a point(only) would allow for more variety on the field.restrictions: only one point rig allowed per ship.calibration: -300"
3/25/2009,getting the ball rolling...
3/25/2009,"how about we limit it to t2 ships (to bridge the gap to the t3 ships)we could also up their calibration to allow for it.i don't think it's a horrible idea, i'd like to see some other opinions though."
3/25/2009,"other thoughts if the penalties are not enough:option 1:if you fit a point rig, you cannot add another disruptor/scram to your standard midslots. (nullifies 2x scrams fitting and dual 24km disruptions)option 2:disruptor/scram fitted using the rig receives a 50% reduction in warp disruption strength. (.5 strength will still prevent a ship without stabs from warping, and dual scramblers will equal only 3 points instead of 4)"
3/25/2009,"this feature would definitely add a lot of versatility to ships, but of course it raises difficult questions on balance, since it can impact so much of the game.why would anyone want to fit a weapon damage rig if it's much better to add a low slot and fit a damage mod?why add a rig to increase scanner strength or sig resolution when it's more efficient to add a mid slot and fit sensor booster or eccm. things of that naturehowever, the general idea is definitely good. you know how minmatar ships supposed to be the most versatile ships in game?what if we gave this rig only to minmatar? it would certainly promote the main advantage of their shipsand so the other faction ships don't feel left out, why not have special rig for each faction? sort of like ""the national rig"", designed specifically to emphasize their faction strengths."
3/25/2009,a half decent idea...i dig it.
3/25/2009,"so you're asking for a scrambler that fits in a rig slot? um, wow. it's an interesting enough idea, i suppose, but at present there's no way to activate a rig - all of them provide passive effects. maybe if the entire rig system was getting overhauled dramatically, but at present i don't think this idea is at all possible to implement."
3/25/2009,"it would act more like the tech 3 subsystems add midslots, only you can not fit anything but scram/disrupters."
3/25/2009,i like the concept but it's a large buff to shield tankers and bleh to armor tankers. i think a better idea would be give all combat ships a built in warp disruptor/scrambler and swap the disruptor and scrambler modules for attribute enhancers that affect the built in version rather than being items themselves.
3/25/2009,"i like the idea, but i would rather see a separate rig for each level of slot, and cap each ship at a max of 1 each.additionally, each rig should still have a penalty. i would propose if you add a slot to one area, you lose a slot somewhere else.so for example:low slot rig, bonus: +1 low slot, penalty: -1 mid slot, calibration 200mid slot rig, bonus: +1 mid slot, penalty: -1 high slot, calibration 200high slot rig, bonus: +1 high slot, penalty: -1 low slot, calibration 200also, afaik, no ship has enough calibration to mount all three (i could be wrong, i'm still realtively new), but two of them are definately possible."

3/25/2009,"game,set,match etho demerzel.vista you just got served."
3/25/2009,"okey first off.i really support the csm, i think it is an extremely good thing to have a few people that can voice the oppinion of the community to ccp so it is not about ""who can scream the highest in the forums wuuhuuu"" which can only bring something bad with it, so i am all for the csm and yes i do agree that they need some more power, and yes i do agree that ccp ****ed up majorly on ... well every turn of the way actually, even with the reaction thing (this cannot have been an oversight, unless the employess at ccp have hat on their feets and pants on their heads while talking funny about grissley), but well nvm, all fine and dandy or whatever you say..but giving the csm credits for stuff which is not their gain is stupid, the queu have been asked for forever, the reason we have always been getting from ccp is ghost training as main problem, ghost training was gone and every one screaming as crazy for the queu, soo this is the reason for that not the csm."
3/25/2009,"the reaction problem is understandable in a programmer's point of view. this game has roughly 40k people on at some of the peaks, maybe higher some days. each cycle (one per hour) would require four calls to the module to prevent the step from occuring. two calls is what they implemented, and it took quite some time to realize the mistake they made. if you call this a mistake, you should also consider the lack of foresight for the y2k bug to be a disaster, even though it made perfect sense at the time of implementation.while i do feel that this csm was both more in the news (due to the pos exploit described above and the dissolution of bob, and now this new problem with bobr), we were also less in the news as many of the major changes in the game have already been presented by csm1. we're working with ccp to get a good mechanic for 0.0 (read the meeting minutes), and mining could definitely use an overhaul.all in all, the csm isn't the bright ray of sunlight shining on ccp's dark deeds, but we do our job of being a liaison between the players and ccp. if you doubt the level of sincerity required to be a csm member, you're welcome to try it, as it's not an easy task."
3/25/2009,"it is not irrelevant to the point he makes, when he bases most of his argument on the idea that he was a gm.it does however not justify the fact that he cheated. you too, are ignoring the evidence then. go and read the damn csm minutes.are you in internal affairs? you too, make assumptions based on things you don't know. how do you know that nobody has been punished? because otherwise is certainly the case.if you think a flight from australia and back is free, then can i have free stuffs?the fact is that you haven't been on the csm. that means you have no real idea what the csm actually does, because you haven't been at any of our meetings. if you had any idea, then you would have another view on it. it is more than a pr stunt. and if you accept facts and don't just go by your circular reasoning, then you would understand."
3/25/2009,"wth! a constructive thread in the eve forums? the sky!!! run!!!in short, i agree"
3/25/2009,"ghost training never had anything to do with it. just have the queue's skill switch check account status - if account is unpaid, queue is inactive. alternately, have the account expiry clear the queue. i don't believe ccp ever said ghost training was the issue, it was players saying that."
3/25/2009,"the fact that he was a dev and not a gm just make the fact even worse and his argument even stronger. a dev doing what he did is far worse than a gm doing the same. what exactly are you drinking?i've read them all. there is nothign ther ebut praises to ccp transparence (which is inexistent by the way) and brownnosing from you. the truth is, as long as ccp is in charge of auditing itself any ""evidence"" they present is null and void. if the csm was assembled to be an external auditing source, as originally suggested, things could be different. as it is, you are useless, and all internal affairs, investigation or evidence talk from ccp is a ridiculous farce. i make any assumptions i wish in the absence of proof. and i bet i am right here. the absence of evidence (not ccp ridiculous pr but real evidence) of the opposite is quite enough for me.the fact that you payed for this and had the availability to do it, even considering how futile and useless the position is for everything but to gather some prestige in an online game, only shows how little value your time has for you.if i need to be in the csm to know what it does, it is already useless, by definition."
3/25/2009,"lavista vista - don't waste your time debating etho. i've seen his ""input"" on forum threads before. he's already made up his mind and will put forth statement after statement that can be neither proven nor disproven. when you can't disprove what he says, he'll think it's victory and insult you. it's a classic conspiracy-theory mindset. silence is the best anti-blowhard technique."
3/25/2009,i prefer telling him his mother smells of elderberries.^_^
3/25/2009,you on the other hand is a nice little alt. maybe lavista's alt? who knows...
3/25/2009,i fart in your general (french accent) direction!
3/25/2009,i rest my case.
3/25/2009,"i dont know if disbanding the csm is the answer but i agree something needs to change. i would suggest ccp implement a new company policy that its employees no longer are permitted to join alliances over a certain size, maybe even not allow them to join in at all.the fact is, it is human nature to abuse any power that is given. teachers are not allowed to date students and radio employees are not allowed to participate in contests. there are reasons why this is done, because it gets abused over and over again, just like we are seeing in eve.come on ccp, grow up and get the devs out of bob and gs and stop this madness once and for all."
3/25/2009,"please, ccp, return the headlights to my revelation.i simply cannot see where i am going. this is horrible."
3/25/2009,"obviously, i support my brilliant idea."
3/25/2009,i can never say no to headlights.
3/25/2009,nor can deer stand dumbstruck in the revelation's path anymore.
3/25/2009,"ccp hinted at this a while back, but i feel it should be done, if possible, sooner than later.- it will drastically reduce isk farming and macros- it would allow mining to be somewhat entertaining, kinda.- it'll open up lowsec to miners, and also make hunting them easier and more fun (they can become complacent)- some other stuff i can't think of right nowperhaps to balance this out with mining noobs, have small belts (enough for a frigate to mine 500-1m isk) around some hisec areas and increase mining missions.edit: this means basically increase sites that require probing and completely remove the standard belts."
3/25/2009,"do you mean the scannable belts? as in, the ones that already exist in normal space? or do you mean something else? op lacks clarity."
3/25/2009,"you can already find scannable grav sites in highsec and lowsec space. in w-space you can find some higher quality belts that have various different and more profitable roids in them, but w-space is 0.0 with all the risks that come along with mining in 0.0 space."
3/25/2009,op updated
3/25/2009,what will stop the isk farmers writing a macro to hunt down belts ?
3/25/2009,"no it wont. they will simple have the one person controlling the mining fleets spend all of 10 minutes to scan out the belts and mark them while the macro fleet moves around.mining will never be entertaining.ahh i see now, this is another one of those ""get rid of highsec because i don't have enough guppies to easily kill in lowsec"" threads.perhaps you should try thinking up an original idea to begin with instead of rehashing the ""force people to lowsec"" whine.this already exsists. accept a mission, complete the mission, don't turn it in, mine the mission.fixed that last one for you."
3/25/2009,"i'm an industrialist, but thanks for assuming"
3/25/2009,personally i think all asteroid belts should be randomly seeded throughout the entire game and you have to scan them out to find them.this would effectively put an end to macro mining as we know it.
3/25/2009,"exactlypeople think that macros can probe with the new system, writing something like that would be extremely complex and not very accurate.as to an isk farmer probing everything and from there on out farming the system, if it happens it happens, but the time that farmer took to scan down would add up.there's probably no way to remove them altogether, however this would alleviate a large number of them."
3/25/2009,"it takes all of 5 minutes to setup a macro to do basic mining. a simple mouse recording program and 5 minutes is all you need.step 1. set bookmarkstep 2. adjust overview to only show roids and sorted by distancestep 3. record the following:-undock-right click, mouse over to new bookmark, warp to bookmark-activate miners-click on the roid at the top of the overview that has been made to only show asteroids and sorted by distance-righ click, mouse over to station, warp/dock-move cargo from hold to hangarset the delays between steps, set the macro to repeat x amount of timesand you are done.the higher end macros work the same way, once you have a warp point and the bookmark set, they work off that. the only work you have to do is finding where to go."
3/25/2009,"that works with static belts, yes. however you have to re-record a macro (or bookmark) every day. it's not a cure for macros, just a treatment."
3/25/2009,"there are several problems:- it will require several changes to the probe system (again ) as the mining sites should be accessible to people that haven't trained the probe use, so they should be scannable using the directional scanner (making the probing skills mandatory is not a good idea);- it will not open low sec to miners. easy to scan mining spots are as much death traps as belts;- respawning of exploration sites is borked. as they respawn in a random system with the same security level in the same general area (if that area is constellation, region or even larger it is not clear) the net effect is that they tend to pile in less used or less accessible systems, so systems without stations, hi sec systems in a pocket after a low sec system and so on. while it can be interesting for gatecampers that want to kill miners at low sec gates it will not enhance mining in any way;- unless the mining pockets are small and so deplete fast it will make little difference for a macro/sweatshop farmer. it is easy to scan with 1 account while the others are mining. at best you would remove the hauler for some minute while it scan all the gravimetric sites in system and bookmark them. if the gravimetric sites are so small that they will hinder macr/sweatshops farmers they will hinder regular miners too."
3/25/2009,i know it is possible to drop modules on spots where you want them by flying there but i don't find this system accurate enough.the problem i have mostly is that i align my defensive mods from the center out. this way i know the range of my guns and i can optimize the pos guns by range.in short i place my mods on a virtual axis.this isn't possible easily atm due to camera restrictions and placement.i believe by making my suggested idea possible you can build your pos more strategically and precisely and a well aligned pos looks way better than a few modules flying here and there .
3/25/2009,1
3/25/2009,"as i was out of the game for some time, did this happen after ccp stated it is an exploit(if they did mark it as exploit of course)? if yes then you should get banned if not, then its game mechanics and the rule apply here as well, so depends on what really happenedi am an individual with my own opinion, my logic state the fair thing not what suits my wallet or what my mates say to flame/whine/pointtohaxbobedit: hell people still pray to god yet we are in the same alliance, that doesn't mean that i share their beliefes (spelling too bored to google, sorryyyy)."
3/25/2009,ex-gonad posting in support of goons.
3/25/2009,this topic might make a fairly amusing eve radio live debate with an invited panel of guests ps not supported obviously since i believe the identity theft should have been reversed almost immediately and band of brothers invited to reform their alliance name and identity.the compromise solution we have now might be pretty messy and not fully satisfy anyone but its far better than allowing the goons to whine their way to reversal of whats obviously been a lengthy gm discussion and response to the identity theft petition.
3/25/2009,hahahaha.
3/25/2009,"stick to your own goddamned rules, and qualify why you didn't do it now _a lot_ better than that meek excuse you have offered until now.what is this, fifth or sixth time? hellbent on betraying the trust of your subscribers. goddamn."
3/25/2009,"you call someone a tool, then ask them to grow up, real mature of you.the name kenzoku was hated by most of their members, and it was a mistake mollee made, and you have to live with the consequences of that terrible alliance name in your corporation's alliance history profile. mollee made a lot of mistakes. he allowed haag to disband the alliance by removing the voting safety measure, he lost a titan and destroyed your morale, he decided to do nothing and stay docked in a npc station, and finally he renames the alliance a fail name ""reloaded"", like darwin reloaded (mollee's titan that died), this new alliance will die pathetically as well.having the name kenzoku demorazlies your members, and was a vicotry for your ennemies, and you can change it using valid game mechanics, but you decided that you didn't want to pay 1,000,000,000 isk, and didn't want to have that stain in your emloyment profile.no one forced you to choose the name kenzoku, except your leader mollee. now live with the shame!your alliance is a joke, and will die as such, none of your ennemies will pay you any respect."

3/25/2009,seriously identity theft? get out. the corporation didn't exist. it's not like band of brothers was disbanding to rename their alliance to band of brothers reloaded.oh wait i just figured out haargoth wasn't behind all of this.
3/25/2009,lotka volterra.never before in the history of this mmorpg? you're terrible at history fyi
3/25/2009,"funny, where do the eve rules say that is illegal? a name was no longer in use, a player created a corporation using that name. how is this breaking the game rules? forget concepts of ""honor"" and ""morals"", rules, how did this break them?"
3/25/2009,"one of the main reasons the playerbase was demanding something like the csm was because of scandles involving favoratism towards bob.again, ccp has shown favoratism towards bob. we want this to stop."
3/25/2009,you can't steal something that isn't taken. the name was available and someone registered it. no rules were broken here.
3/25/2009,same rules for everyone.
3/25/2009,everyone else who has asked for a name change ever has been told to f*ck off. this is bs.
3/25/2009,i'm honestly confused here. jade can you please explain in as much text as you possibly can how you can steal a name nobody is currently using? again please make sure you use a giant wall of text because it seems to make you look important.
3/25/2009,"ah, so instead of this rather minor abuse of their authority, you would prefer ccp have committed a much more significant abuse of their authority."
3/25/2009,bright colors and flashing images help too hth.
3/25/2009,"yeah, us goonies have a terrible attention span."
3/25/2009,"the former eve alliance everlasting vendetta went to play wow, their guild was disbanded and the name grabbed by another group of players before they could reform, i know it's absolutely astonishing that something like this has happened elsewhere in the mmo universekeep using scary words like ""steal"" and ""theft"" to suggest goons did anything but capitalize on bob stupidity and used anything but working-as-intended in-game mechanics to disband bob and get their namekeep failing to see the difference between using in-game methods to achieve alliance goals and getting a gm to flip a switch to make changes to an alliance that are impossible for players to make on their own"
3/25/2009,disband them or allow the rest of us to do the same.
3/25/2009,"even better maybe jade could put it into the form of a song with some guitar, we could called it jade trolls unplugged."
3/25/2009,i support this e-drama
3/25/2009,"actually you're wrong. it happened in age of conan. two guilds who hated and despised each other had a long running conflict brought about from sharing a resource instance with each other. ""captain morgan society"" eventually destroyed the enemy guild ""the fallen guard"" when the guild leader decided in a moment of drunken madness to rename the guild ""rolving re tards"" (no idea what 'rolving' means, i assume it was meant to be 'loving' or maybe 'revolving'). when this happened, one of the captain morgan society guys dropped guild and immediately made a new guild stealing the guild name before they could change back. in the ensuing thread the action was actually compared to one you may find in eve-online and was deemed legal. it occured on one of the strict roleplaying servers where guild name, identity and reputation is probably more important than on a plain pve or pvp server.in essence it's little different, as sirmolle removed the safety checks ingame himself (shares for votes). thus was vulnerable to such an action by his own making.you can read about it here although tbh it's a pretty boring thread.captain thunk"
3/25/2009,"speaking of reading before posting jade, are you going to read every post of unprecedented support for this idea?please take the time to do so - that way we don't have to read your terrible posts for awhile.oh yeah, and here's something to think about while you're reading:-kenzoku was formed several months before bob was disbanded-former bob corps could have created an alliance with the revised name-goonswarm has had several director-level spies and hasn't been disbanded-bob was only disbanded because their executor corp was structured for quick & easy access-get out."
3/25/2009,"goonswarm before ""agtard gate"" = goonswarm after ""agtard gate"" = goonswarm after ""molle gate"" = thank you,dr. shot"
3/25/2009,"so bob had 2 choices after they were disbandeda. join kenzoku, instant alliance and sov.b. make new alliance , with a better name and pay one bil. (don`t know about a sov mechanics concerning a newly created alliance, hope someone can explain)they decided for a and they get their instant alliance. but now they decide want to do b instead, and gm allowed that. seems like cheating to me"
3/25/2009,same rules for everyone.
3/25/2009,"i just see a standard goon+coalition threadnaught with no real substance demanding that ccp bend over for 5000 players in a dark corner of 0.0. nothing new really. ultimately i think you need understand that a thread full of alts and mindless ""+1s"" doesn't really achieve anything. this thread will go the way of the ""make goons in charge of caod"" thread and disappear in a couple of days in a puff of smoke and hyperbole and nobody will lament its absence.meanwhile the rest of the server gets on with playing the game. i'd advise you to do the same."
3/25/2009,the most supported thread in the assembly hall should be dismissed in a puff of smoke.you obviously have no faith in the csm. can you remember why it was created?
3/25/2009,"there is no reason why the gms should change kenzoku's name simply because ""it's not the right name""."
3/25/2009,"my case: after a few months of playing s9 ticker became available (didn't had it at that time). kindly asked 2 times the gms to give it to my corp since no-one was using it. ""no, can't do!"" so i had to close the corp - move all assets to corp members, get out/kick all corp members, and finally leave the corp only to re-do it 10min later with the ticker we wanted.other examples:stian empire was created. someone noticed the typo, told ccp. ccp told them to disband the alliance (and getting no refund from the 1bn isk needed to create it), recreate the alliance (and once again pay 1bn isk to create it) and make sure to spell the name correctly.black 0ut was created. someone realized how dumb this was, and so they asked ccp to change it to black out. ccp told them no, and that they'd have to disband the alliance (and get no refund from the 1bn isk needed to create it), recreate the alliance (and once again pay 1bn isk to create it) and make sure to spell the name the way they wanted to.against all authorities had a slight mishap where someone didn't pay the maintenance build. they lost all their sovereignty, had to recreate the alliance, and had to once again front the 1bn isk fee. ccp did not reimburse any of that.bobr's case: the eula clearly doesn't give you any rights to have your alliance name changed. as for bad game mecanics when bob was first dismantled, it was no-ones fault (in-game), the same faulty game mecanics apply to everyone in-game (other alliances can suffer the same fate sooner or later - until ccp changes something). you went down thru legitimate in-game mecanis - have the spine to recognize it.the name itself has little importance (you can have yer old name back for all i care). but bending the eula rules, still going strong for sov3 in some systems and not paying the 1bn bill - these facts clearly put ccp in a delicate position again because it clearly shows bobr plays this game by one set of rules and us the rest by another set.first among equals.and lets make one thing clear, this is not bobr's fault. this is a ccp failure, because they still want to interfere in eve politics. why is this happening.. idk, the only logical conclusion is that some people with a lot of decisional power in ccp still have strong ties with bobr. after the t20 problems, i sincerely doubt even lead gms do something big like this without asking permision from the head-honchos.eve is not ccp's love-child anymore, it's a cash cow. and it shows. milk it while you can. however some people will never understand that money, even big money can be made in a number of ways. it doesn't have to be like this.if csm has any voice whatsoever this issues will be on their agenda. and yes internal affairs should be notified about this, they should get mails from as many peeps as possible. be decent, civil, but have a voice. mail them!btw, bobr i hope you understand why a lot of eve hates you now. it's not yer so-called elitism. it's the cheating you need to resort to in order to win something, it's the lenghts you go to bend the rules.as for sending us out for a walk in rl so we don't moan about internet spaceshipz business.. how about you follow yer own advice, and when you come back at the keyboard you try to play the game fair-play (and have some phun while you're at it).the irony is that it's not gonna matter in the end. enough entities in-game have the means now to take you down completely and keep you down. you're not the elitist alliance you once were. you're just average now (as a lot of other peeps got into a lot of caps now).fame lasts 15min, infamy lasts a bit longer."
3/25/2009,i have no faith in goons thats an entirely different matter. csm was created (amongst other things) to provide oversight on correct goings on inside ccp in their relations to the community. in this case a gm has provided a response to the community and a decision has been made. this thread represents a standard goon threadnaught trying to bully out advantage in eve by threatening to damage ccp's pr on the internets.nobody should cave in to bullying.
3/25/2009,"excellently put, at the very least ccp needs to go into more detail about how kenzoku is different from any of the cases mentioned."
3/25/2009,"lol, as if the intention of the 'hurry up and create a corp' wasn't to steal bob's identity solely to rub salt into some virtual pixel wound. one only needs to look at the silly toon names that post from said corp to see through that charade. this whine fest has nothing to do with ccp this or gm that. it's everything to do with the fact that bob now has some of their identity restored. i agree 100% with jade contantine and others that the original corp name theft should not have been allowed to stand. rename the childish goon corp to bobr and bobr to bob. at that point all will be well in the world of eve.still it's hilarious to see the goons and their northern nut cuppers stamp their feet like little children and spam the forums. they someone think that making a billion threads and filling them with a billion posts from goons, goon alts and goon nut cuppers it's the same as having a thought worth listening to. last year it was spamming the forums trying to get jade contantine removed as csm president and your own ******* put in. last week it was 'wahhh isd didn't report us sitting outside a station for a month picking our noses.' now it's ""wahhhh, bob has their identity back no fair we stole their name proper like."" it'll be something different next week. the whineswarm will always continue."
3/25/2009,"you make that quite clear in your many rambling posts. maybe you should have a glance at some of the pages in this thread. do you really think all those posts for support are by goons?you have made your point several times that you don't like goons, we understand, maybe you are envious of their success, i don't know. please stop trolling this thread like it was caod."
3/25/2009,another bobr shows the mentality of a 5 year old. stop posting sfsfailme. you are only making yourself look an idiot.
3/25/2009,sad truth !!! btw i do not support this.
3/25/2009,"my 2 cents....01 - bob chose to rename to ken for a reason, it gave them control over some portions of space or something. it didnt work out and eventually goons took even that away from them. if bob had created a new name and got no benefit from it then i would agree the new name change is irrelevent but thats not the case, bob benefited from using the ken name so they should be stuck with it. .01 - it didnt take ccp two months to figure out that bob was disbanded using legal game mechanics and that goons took the bob name. if this was an abuse of the game mechanics then it should have been dealt with in the first two weeks. it ticks me off that ccp waited for the ken thing to go bad (ie. get their butts handed to them by gs) and then decided to let them change their name. disclaimer - the opinions expressed here reflect my own personal opinion and not the views of my corp or the cva alliance."
3/25/2009,"well, i think the massive majority are from goons, goon alts, goon allies and good fanbois - a smaller proportion might be from younger players carried along with the hue and cry and mistakenly believing some of the complete nonsense that is being posted by the goons. ultimately this is partizan political thread and the goon coalition has been instructed to follow the party line by its leadership."
3/25/2009,"i really don't know what to make of this.one one hand, a disgraced, cheating alliance seems to yet again have been rewarded by gm's in what appears to be a clearly inappropriate use of gm discretion.on the other, i am so sick of the pathetic, puerile destruction of coad and the in-game spamming of goonswarm.i am amazed to find myself ambivalent; i really don't care. the more i think about it, the more i think that it is no big deal whether it is kenzoku or bob reloaded.as for goonies whining, i find myself thinking that perhaps if they showed more respect to others i would care that there was a bias against them by the gm's.i suppose i will get spammmed with abusive eve-mails and 1 line abusive comments but as far as i am concerned is the only difference between goonswarm and bob is that bob got caught cheating red handed.apart from that; there is not much between them at all."
3/25/2009,"right instead lets have them bendover for 3000 in public. besides jade thoes 5000+ players don't matter right? they are all goons, every single one of them in this whole thread are goons and goon alts. whats a a few thousand +1s here and there... oh thats right the whole point of the csm. i really instensely dislike people like you. at least with goons you know where you stand, they wear their identity on their sleeve. you, you will support principles one day, anything goes the next, and have a public identity crisis on the third. you have no principles and frankly it gets annoying trying to have a forum debate with you. i don't know what to say because i know you aren't reading or listening, your just posting and reading your own posts.are you saying there is no history of gm misconduct, and are you saying that nothing here is wrong at all? really? come on jade, please throw us all a bone and take a stand one way or the other (goonswarm aside). is it right or is it wrong."
3/25/2009,don't worry - goons have been caught red-handed a fair bit in the past too. its pretty standard for big-alliance corruption
3/25/2009,i see you are still out of touch with those you want to feel as if you represent.
3/25/2009,"there was a history of developer misconduct. it has been dealt with. nowadays the ""dev misconduct"" thing is just a rallying call for goons to attempt to blugeon their way to victory in a political game that seeks to achieve results with whining and threadnaughts rather than playing the game.whats wrong here is that goons were allowed to keep the band of brothers alt corp without having it renamed ""evecorp4234023049"" in response to the bob leadership petition against identity theft. why this happened is even more troubling because i very much suspect it was delayed and delayed through fear of negative press before the retail release of the latest expansion. if this is indeed the case then it suggests the goon alliance has successfully bullied ccp into allowing full on identity theft to the detriment of an entire community of eve players and this is a very bad precedent.i can't believe you couldn't read all that from my earlier posts to be quite honest."
3/25/2009,dont forget friends of goon helped too.and if anyone cares to look. i believe it was on page 37 that 2 members of the bobr alliance posted support for this thread. joke or not. it still counts
3/25/2009,"no, because ccp has already set up enough bad precedents (pos bowling, alliance renaming, banning the guy who finds out about the cheating dev....)"
3/25/2009,jade i am still waiting for your explanation on how you can steal a name nobody is using. however rather then explaining this please feel free to continue crying foul and crying identity theft. that works just as well i suppose.
3/25/2009,"well tee-shirts, mugs, killboard graphics, logos, hell ... custom keyrings and engraved nipple-clamps - who knows? point as you very well know is that when 3000 players build a community around an ingame identity that identity belongs to them in some greater sense than a mere collection of letters. but we both know your question was a troll since your own alliance leader has admitted ""rushing"" to register the alt corp identity purely to block the rightful owners of the name recreating their alliance name after the director-level emocide."
3/25/2009,"ah thank you that makes sense. since they somehow ""own"" the rights to this name even though they are no longer using it nobody else can. so what ccp should do is modify the rules of the game to disallow anyone from using any previously used corp or alliance name/ticker. see when you put it that way it makes perfect sense. thank you again.follow up question, since you were on csm. do you think when they add the ability to walk around in stations they should also add brothels?"
3/25/2009,"yes. and opium dens, illicit bare-knuckle fist-fighting rings, black market genetic emporiums, slums and every kind of seedy local you can think of."
3/25/2009,"actually the ""bare-knuckle fist-fighting rings"" would probably make for a pretty interesting side game. if that was the case i'm not sure if i would rather see the mittani vs dianabolic or jade constantine vs darius johnson."
3/25/2009,stop crying goons...
3/25/2009,"you haven't read this thread have you? it's not a simple name change, its about the rules and the favoritism they showed to kenzoku. the only time a name can be changed is if its offensive in some way. kenzoku clearly isn't. it isn't a japanese swear word or anything so too bad. that being said, if one alliance gets to have their name changed due to petition of members within their own alliance; everybodys name can be changed then."
3/25/2009,"so, everybody who disagrees with you is a goon or a noob and therefore their opinion doesn't count. how convenient."
3/25/2009,"technically no, doesn't matter what their community built up, you could use the argument that the usa television channel hbo and time warner has more rights to the band of brothers due to their 2001 tv drama series based on the life and actions of 101st airborne, easy company in world war 2 than a group of 3000 internet spaceship game players, who have no real world legal claim to the name.at the time after the bob alliance was disbanded through legitimate in game mechanics the was no alliance, corporation or any other entity called band of brothers, no one individual or group had any preferential right to the name regardless of how many key rings or tee-shirts they had. goons got their first, and bob wasn't fast enough to do anything about it!"
3/25/2009,"approved. if ccp wants to start enabling name-changes, then let them notify the player base in an orderly manner and post their policy for such. other games charge real money as well for such a privilage (like portrait changes).regardless, unilateral action favoring a single faction or alliance (again, bob) is intolerable, and exactly why the csm exists. you'd think someone would have learned their lesson after t20, but whatever... back to the woodshed we take them!--krum"
3/25/2009,"no compromise. not even in the face of armageddon.i see it is busy spewing nonsense like it's going out of style here, too. has it found a cross to nail itself to yet?"
3/25/2009,"one would have hoped that ccp would have learned its lesson about giving an alliance preferential treatment. out of a desire not to play a game run by people out of touch with reality, one also would have hoped that after years of rampant corruption from isd, an exposed cheating dev and numerous documented devs involved in bob that ccp would have noticed that it wasn't ok to blatantly play favorite with the same group of people again.rename bobr to rkz and let them disband pay 1bil and reset all of their sov counters if they want to get the name that they were inexplicably given without having to following in game mechanics . . . just like everyone else. i am actually having a hard time believing that this wasn't a unilateral action but some junior gm who didn't understand the ****storm he was walking into - can't conceive that there would be obvious preferential treatment like this and that they would actually break game mechanics by allowing them to go over the character limit."
3/25/2009,"supported, but disband goonswarm too once the drama dies down and the forums get boring again."
3/25/2009,shameful
3/25/2009,"something so insignificant, get a grips of yourself's people, in the ""context"" of what has happened and the due process that went about to the renaming personally i see nothing wrong with it.it appears that a lot of people are just caught up with the ""e-hate"" and lack any common sense.my 2c, but don't let me stop your winning."
3/25/2009,"sup, welcome to eve, i guess you haven't been playing for very long, and don't quite rememnber t20, aura, delve buffs, and all of the other crap bobr has gotten handed to them from corrupt devs and gms over the yearschange the name back, disband bobr, or drop their sov. this **** has gone on for too long now."

3/25/2009,no expetions for single entities.if this option is available to everyone then there is no problem. but it is not.main point is. one exception leads to another exception and so on and in the end you got ppl exploiting the system and ruining the game.
3/25/2009,"what exactly is the issue? would you ***** and moan if mr. smith down the street changes his name to mr. johnson as well?bob was crippled by borderline abuse/exploit of game mechanics or lack thereof and they went through proper channels when they realised that the old name had been ""reserved"" by another party.this whole propaganda campaign smells like a mass-psychotic break due to personal issues with the name ""band of brothers"", nothing good ever came from mass-hysteria.a name was changed, no other action was taken. if you feel mistreated or that an unfair advantage was gained by it, put in a petition with internal affairs.internet spaceships are serious, i get that, but we are talking letters here for goddess' sake .. their spaceships still blow up and they will probably still partake in the local-smack we all know and love in null-sec."

3/25/2009,but yes i have an alt and i think this situation is typical of ccp and raises questions about the integrity of the whole game.
3/25/2009,i support this.
3/25/2009,"even if it is not really bobr's failure, i support this. such buddy deals have to stop finally..."
3/25/2009,"oh wait, band of developers? that should be goonswarm, because, they do have the most members that are gm/devs.it's quite hypocritical to call someone to be favoured by the devs when those people whining about it have the biggest number of people working for ccp.and, why exactly is this petition about ""disband bobr""? it was only a namechange. if, at all, you're requesting something, it should be ""rename bobr back to kenzoku"", because everything else just shows what the real purpose of this is:to finally and utterly destroy bob and every member in it. it didn't work with all naping each other, it didn't work with using a clearly quite broken game mechanic using a defect member (but yes, it was intentional that you can disband a whole alliance, yet you have to wait 24h to unlock a bpo, wait 24h to kick an unwanted member out of a corp )and still bob is there and fights.what comes next?p.s.: thanks for killing aurora, because, they so clearly favoured bob and did all those favours for them. it's really nice that there's not a single bloody event left, it brings the backstory soooo close to us, makes us feel we can influence it.p.p.s.: having a spy in an alliance is ok. but hacking into forums and ts servers or sniffing packets from the internet isn't truly inside the game rules."
3/25/2009,"funny how people pick up on the slightest peice of misinformation and run with it like it is proof.i assume you are talking about shares.i also assume you have never been in a position where you could actually try kicking a corp out of an alliance?--i honeslty don't know how goonswarm got away with identity theft which other corps have been punished for previously, but i don't really care either.the fact is that they were shown favouritism that other corps have not been shown, and i think that is a gross injustice. the current situation is nothing more than an uncomfortable compromise.i'm serious."
3/25/2009,"hi avon, remember saying this?how times change"
3/25/2009,"this is a tough decision for me, because while i think what happened to bob in the first place was fairly trashy, and unfortunate (certainly not the way i would want to bring down a foe), and i think meta gaming is lame true, but this is all part of what makes eve great and it does seem like their may be some favoritism here. if ccp could provide some proof that they have taken similar actions before (which i do not believe they have) then perhaps i would be more amicable to the whole name change situation. furthermore, now that a precedent has been set, they better be ready and willing to change any alliance name. in addition, if bobr did get to keep their sov. despite the change that is fairly unconventional too i think, because usually an alliance to change their name would have to reform and lose sov. so bob most likely should have had to undergo the same process at least, instead of just having a quick painless transfer.so at the moment, with the given information, i support this cause, bobr should have to disband, then they should reform with their new name and sacrifice standing etc, it just seems more fair that way. i do have sympathy for bob because of the whole way they went down (very dis-honorable way to win goons imo...) but still it shouldn't get them sympathy from devs who should be un-biased and not show any form of favoritism. let's see how it shakes out."
3/25/2009,"goonswarm may have the most devs/gms, but they're not the ones getting rules bent to help them win at internet spaceships like bob. they don't have a history of devs/gms flat out cheating to help their alliance."
3/25/2009,"first id just like to say that sure, the disbanding by one button is kinda fsckt-up but:if molle hadn't removed the shares so alliance changes could go through without a vote then that's his mistake.and how come a absent director still had executor roles intact?its like removing your firewall because your bandwidth suffers lag, who's fault is it your ""secrits"" gets stolen? you or the hacker capitalising on the security lapse?not anybody's fault but your own you did a stupid thing like this.and your ""letter of the law"" point...its not that the name changed, most couldn't care less.its that you guys got the rules bent in your favour by ccp yet again!countless alliances have had to disband/lose sov/pay 1bill and reform to get what you got by ""pressing 1 button""... (ironic i know :p) so i guess:"
3/25/2009,66 pages of spam by the 12 people who care and their 6 alts.this is quite a threadnaught.see if you can get it 80 pages of wasted disk space by tonight.
3/25/2009,thanx for helping out
3/25/2009,"you are on page 67, thanks for helping ""the cause"".and there are allot more then ""the swarm"" raising their legitimate voice."
3/25/2009,lol double post... that<U+FFFD>s been awhile.
3/25/2009,"you know what, **** it, following 3 accounts (each char on a seperate account) cancelled until this **** is reversed.thoradhtcupnavaj0might be back if this gets reversed..."
3/25/2009,violation of the rules. needs to be changed back until all other alliances can do this.
3/25/2009,"i am a new player. just plugged in my 60 day code a few days ago. i mainly became interested in looking at eve due to all the news that was generated because of the goons taking down bob. (i guess that is a testament to the saying ""there is no such thing as bad press."") i think however questionable the goons taking out of bob was, it does not merit any special treatment by the developers. if they used in-game metrics to complete what amounts to a hostile takeover then so be it. if that in-game metric needs to be changed then the systems put in place to make in-game rule changes should be utilized. if there is an in game metric for changing your alliance name then it should be used. anything else would be some form of favoritism. regardless good luck to all involved."
3/25/2009,can i change my name please?
3/25/2009,hey look.
3/25/2009,ccp doesnt realize that with such a small game like this word of mouth is the best advertisement they cant get really. now they have over 1300 players calling shenanigans. most of these players are willing to stop playing if ccp doesnt listen to overwehlming opinion of the players.with this massive amount of disappointment ccp will lose allot of business.i for one will not pay my subscription until this is fixed and i urge all of you to do the same.
3/25/2009,+
3/25/2009,"hey d ickheadof 2000 posts in the thread 1400 are unique votes in agreement with the proposal. we only get to vote once.it amazes me that you big alliances think you are the only ones in this game. i have no knowledge of, or connection to, any major player. but i pay for the game and i expect there to be no cheating from the developers or ccp.as has been said, if ccp have repeatedly done such high profile cheats for bob how many other times have they given them things and not been found out"
3/25/2009,"yes ,and ban all goon ******s aswell."
3/25/2009,1
3/25/2009,"67 pages, countless posts.... and still no reply from ccp.a shame, really"
3/25/2009,1
3/25/2009,they killed kenny!save the kenny!
3/25/2009,hate aligning with goonies but this **** has to stop ccp.
3/25/2009,this isn't factual. shares have nothing to do with the mechanic in play.
3/25/2009,"who cares what you think jade?one game, one rule. if ccp hasn't dealt with this issue by next week i am thinking some other online games are looking better. i can vote with my 6 accounts.here is the root of the problem ccp, in case you were not aware what everyone is so upset about. we spend our money, our time, and our effort to sink into this vast game that you create. we are not all massochists alright? time and time again we get into conflicts with this bob entity. this entity gets favors, and has been caught for a lot of things, who knows what it has not been caught for. it is my suspicion that ""max damage"" actually stood for ""max gtcs"" cause if you think about it damage = gtcs. perhaps the brass at ccp keep someone up high on the food chain so that they can increase the sales of gtcs. maybe this is all about money, manipulating the game to make more cash. whatever the reason, this whole thing is complete bull**** having one alliance that just seems to keep getting the favors. yeah i have 6 characters to vote with. your move ccp."
3/25/2009,this is becoming ridiculous.
3/25/2009,i want to change my alliance name!no exception for rules.
3/25/2009,no one should be above the rules
3/25/2009,yes!bending rules has to end at some point and this seem as good time as any to stop the insanity.at the very least make return the name into it's orginal state and give them the same option everyone else has had. 'create a new alliance if you want a new name..'
3/25/2009,i'm a pirate
3/25/2009,"down with band of developers and bob online!ps - jade, no one cares. really, i'm serious."
3/25/2009,"i will use one of your meme<U+FFFD>s here:""i believe"" it is.if you point me in the right direction of said rule stating that it is not. then ill concede this point ofc.however, taking your ""words"" for anything but spin is harder and harder for every line of text you write.ccp nor you and the ""animals more equal then others"" can not ignore all these people crying:""something is rotten in the state of denmark"" (iceland)(ooh orwell and shakespeare..., i knew that library card would pay of :p)"
3/25/2009,"every alliance is born, every alliance can die.thats the game"
3/25/2009,"i don't know who we're kidding.even if the csm has the brass to broach this subject, ccp won't act on it. despite having more support by almost an order of magnitude than any other issue i've seen.not even if every player not in kenzoku supports it.:sigh: what can you possibly do when the entity holding all the keys is against you?"
3/25/2009,supporting this
3/25/2009,its just a frickin name !!!!
3/25/2009,"what you don't understand is sov mechanics. if they wanted a new name they should have left or disbanded kenzoku and formed a new alliance just like every single other group in this game would have had to.i guess i misunderstood what had happened originally. i guess all the former bob corps joined another already formed alliance instead of creating a new one, so they had no say over their name when they joined kenzoku.they had a choice: join kenzoku, or make a new alliance with a new name. they chose kenzoku, this never should have even been considered by ccp."
3/25/2009,yes change the name back.....no special rules for *spezial* friends
3/25/2009,"they could have made a new alliance called bob reloaded if they cared so much about their identity, they did not. they chose an already existing alt alliance to join called kenzoku to give them sov advantage in delve. they made their decision, they should have to live with it and not break the rules everyone else has to follow."
3/25/2009,found at least the right symbol for agreeing with the proposal...
3/25/2009,"lets see if the csm has any real power, not holding my breath tho."
3/25/2009,i don't like beavers
3/25/2009,"so false, considering 90% of the 'supports' in this thread are by alt's which in turn are probably goon//nc alts.if you could only support this with 1 char per account then we would see the real number."
3/25/2009,says the bob pet.
3/25/2009,"i don't agree with you, ergo, you're a bob alt/pet."
3/25/2009,"grimmi already explained the action taken yesterday so there's no point in continuing the bitter rage. regardless of what either csm says, there really is no voice for the player base that will ever be heard and actions addressed in the right time.band of brothers and kenzoku are nothing more than a name much like any other corp or alliance. love them or hate them it makes no difference. log into eve and kill them if you hate bob that much. the only voice that will ever be heard is the guns blazing and missile spamming of internet spaceships tbh."
3/25/2009,"like an apologist asking ""why resist a military junta?"""
3/25/2009,"bob made their choice when they decided to become kenny, they should be made to live with their choice like everyone else has to; soverignty, or name, not both.ccp should be made to acknowledge their mistake, other people/corps/alliances have been denied a name change, and to bend the rules for kenny and change it is rediclous, especially given that by now kenny was estabished as an alliance name and identity.gm's still need to learn some pr skills; in the threads about this i've seen them not reply despite people asking them to, while still managing to delete people's posts, and when they have replied they seem to make excuses to fob people off.not happy with ccp."
3/25/2009,why they did this? they must've know that it would create a ****storm. it's very disrespectful to me as a paying customer.
3/25/2009,i see alot of goonswarm/something awful alts.... i hardly expect to see this thread taken seriously....
3/25/2009,you can't refute any point made so you whine about alts instead
3/25/2009,"bob and friends might dont take it serious. but i think breaking general rules for a small group of players is an issue for the whole playerbase. it in this case has nothing to do with bob itself. it could have been every other alliance which has developers friends and got other dev favors in the past, if there would be any..."
3/25/2009,"i support this. no alliance should be able to use gms to circumvent sov mechanics. i don't care about the name, this about actualin-game cheating.they should be disbanded, and allowed to to recreate the alliance with that same name. well, close to it. apparently it's too long for a player to actually create. they'll be ""band of brothers reloade"". which is close enough, i'd think. i'm sure they'd be happy with that.i actually have some sympathy for them, but as far as i know the disbanding and subsequent registration of the bob name was completely legitimate and caused by a meta-game betrayal which ccp has expressly allowed, if not actively encouraged. it is, in fact, one of eve's strongest selling points. so while i know it must suck to be bob this recent change must not be allowed to stand. sympathy is not justification for cheating."
3/25/2009,"the number of other goons that got trolled by the ""character limit"" on corporation and alliance names amuse me. its not 24/25/whatever guys. everything else still stands though. one rule for all."
3/25/2009,"the whole point is bias since the only people replying are the ones who would benefit from the proposal, if one that demanded the disbanding of razor or goonswarm on some technical ground that was minor which this is effectivly poped up and got 2000 votes from mostly corpless alts would you expect it to be taken seriously....another thing this is is a pr attempt to drag bob throught the dirt again to gain credability something which the goonswarm has been lossing at a dramitic rate if any of my fellow empire freinds have to say.what ever you say its obbious what is going on here. anyone with half a brain can see so dont try and lecture to be about right and wrong your wasting the energy in your fingers."
3/25/2009,answer ccp. we're waiting.maybe a false advertising complaint wouldn't hurt. you can't say its a player run world with this many complaints.
3/25/2009,"1 rule, 1 game, no nepotistic bull****."
3/25/2009,"keep drinkin' the kool-aid man. erase the names bobr and goons from this issue and the point is obvious. the problem is being clouded by the entities involved.this is wrong, period."
3/25/2009,i support this
3/25/2009,"no the issue is minor and pointless. its over a string of characters, its fueled by childish vendetas and in game aspirations to gain a upper hand."
3/25/2009,"sorry mate, but i do belive that all this ""csm... assembly wall... n' stuff"" was created only to keep us entertained with something(and some hope.. but only that).i belive ccp will do the same thing as others, hide(you will not read/hear a word from them.)but, as a wise man once said, hope is the last to die.- seifer"
3/25/2009,some good ratting systems are cynojammed now due to this :(
3/25/2009,"i do believe you're wrong. shows a basic misunderstanding of the csm system, which by it's design takes some time to have an effect. even if the skill que was the only thing they had ever done, it would validate their existence, but they also provided some serious balancing, ui tweaks, and the orca.thats not the point here anyhow. this thread is just another pr attempt by the goons. bob did the same thing to them when they had any real power. the two just go back and forth annoying everyone else in the universe.since the goons will bump this for another year or so, no harm in condemning the waste of a slot on the assembly's main page.you frothing lap-dogs."
3/25/2009,what do you think would be better - that ccp openly declares it's support for bob or that it just stays silent and denies everything?what are you gonna do if they get balls enough to declare a favorite alliance? fight them or rage-quit?i'd think it'd be pretty amusing if they came out in the open
3/25/2009,"i strongly, full-heartedly support this. i've never worked with goonies nor with bob. but the very stickiness between bob and ccp goes beyond one's capacity of describing it in proper words. it's like i'm unknowingly getting a lemon from a car dealer w/ exactly the same amount of cash his cousin pays for to get a mercede from backdoor. if i am mad enough to go for being headlined, i'd smash his store w/ the lemon he sold, and shot him in his face. w/ the so much public announcement of your love to your bob, you are sharply indicating me that the portion of my life i've waisted is just digitalized as few binary glitches of the your database file. and you are saying you can play it however you want it. fine. i get it.like ghost training issue and t2 bpo scandal, however, this one will go down a long way for the years to come. you will never be free from people armed with these issues ganking you when and where most unexpected, and i promise you that i will be one of them.fly safe."
3/25/2009,"need a tinfoil? this thread makes me laugh everytime i read it stop the whining, fight them all you want, and stop annoying people with the same crap for the rest of the year...big boohoo that they changed they're name, are you scared to fight them now or something?and what do i think would be better? for more raging goon muppets so i lol some more"
3/25/2009,"you exploited game mechs, no !*flame suit on*"
3/25/2009,"you exploited game mechs, no !*flame suit on*"
3/25/2009,"how hard is it for your people to see the point? it's about the fact that they've been given special treatment that allowed them to keep sov when other alliances would have been told to disband if they wanted a new name. bob jumped into kenzoku to gain/keep a little sov easily and quickly then later asked to get the name changed to something they wanted instead of going about it the normal, legit way and making a new alliance with the name they wanted from the start then gaining sov."
3/25/2009,"nice ad for eve ccp, before when people ask me about eve i use to answer it was a good game thank to the gameplay etc.. now f*** up the gameplay i will say to don't try it cause devs aren't fair with all player. gg ccp your game sucks by now"
3/25/2009,"the op is mistaken that this has never been done before. there are numerous examples that everyone seems to be ignoring in general and caod threads, so based on that i disagree. keep the tears flowing though since caod is much cleaner now that the goons and goon allies are around a circle ""discussing"" the issue."
3/25/2009,lol
3/25/2009,nice sig. ill take it.

3/25/2009,"name change was rescinded, seems like a fair enough solution to me."
3/25/2009,"we do not have to quit. let us all suspend our subscription for 1 month. i am certain we can find other games to play for just 1 month. loss of a month's revenue might not bankrupt ccp, or even dent their wallet, but its effect will be felt. for alliances holding sovereignty, they can cycle the numbers, 33% of the alliance will suspend subscription for a month, and for those with numerous accounts, suspend subscription on one account. this has to get ccp's attention.what really gets to me is that no explanation has been offered"
3/25/2009,"oh, the irony of that sig. it's delicious."
3/25/2009,boosh!
3/25/2009,what was the social impact of bob being changed to kenzoku?kenny always dies at the end :)

3/25/2009,"is this real, or a troll? (guessing by the amount of exclamation marks, i'd say the latter - but we are on the eve forum...)i thought the whole point of that mission is that you have to visit all empires to complete it.does anyone know if the agents will talk to you, even if your standings are too low?that would be nice, imo - you could do the mission if you're fast enough to escape the local navy :-)"
3/25/2009,"this might be me, but since when do gate guns attack you if you have low standing with a empire?afaik but that's been over a year ago, all you got was some navy ships trying to destroy you, which where at best a threat to lvl 1 frigates.guessing it's gotten upgraded with faction warfare... but by that much??"
3/25/2009,"if you don't know where you are going and what your standing means, you deserve to get blown up. take the lesson and don't repeat the mistake.even the note that tells you about the epic mission mentions that you need to be able to access all of empire space. if you found a note that said ""everyone who warps to the following coordinates needs to be able to tank 5000dps em damage"", would you hop into your merlin and jump right over there, only to complain that you had no chance?"
3/25/2009,"yes, the agents will talk to you, but you always have them saying something like ""get out of my face"" before they give you the mission. it's almost comical, but it works.also, if you can't travel to all the empires, learn the diplomacy skill. if you have it and still can't travel to all the empires, it sucks to be you. we've been trying to implement a way to gain standing for a faction without doing missions, but we're still at a loggerhead.hopefully, we'll see it soon. until then, don't do the epic arc."

3/25/2009,"whats your view of the blatant favoritism within ccp regarding the alliance formally known as band of brothers,and the blatant disregard to their own eula regarding the name change from kenzuko to band of brother reloaded and all that it entails."
3/25/2009,"from a personal perspective i believe that the examples in the past of favoritism shown towards the alliance formally known as band of brothers has been much hyped up. the t20 ""scandal"" for instance was a case of favoritism shown towards a particular player/corp within the band of brothers alliance and not the alliance as a whole. i also think that when this happens it is up to ccp to investigate and deal with like any other business rather than the eve community in general. as an example if you somehow got a meeting with a representative of a major oil company and demanded to know the results of a disciplinary against one of their plant workers you would be quickly told where to go. in this particular case i cannot see how it happened whilst maintaining the precedent ccp have stuck to before. having said that i also don't know what happened internally at ccp. additionally i personally cannot see any significant way it effects the game apart from being an irritation to those who wanted to change their alliance, corp or player names in the past and have been refused the chance and for those who would use such an event as propaganda for their own cause. i would prefer to stick to issues that actually effect people's ability to play the game and/or find the most enjoyment from the game; although if enough people wanted to know if this had been investigated by ccp i would certain be more than happy to ask that question of them. as stated in the previous example though i wouldn't consider it appropriate for me to demand of ccp to release any details beyond the fact that an investigation had or had not happened. if they wished to release more details that is entirely their prerogative. i hope that helps you make up your mind one way or another."
3/25/2009,"alright, let me ask one of the more volitile questions. i take it due to your associations with star fraction and your wanting to be in the csm that you've monitored the past two candidacies. what mistakes have they made that you would've done differently if you had the chance?second, your corpmate's reputation in the csm is well known, and many don't look favorably upon the exchange that occured in csm 1. what would you say to make us believe that this isn't a repeat of the past and that you will behave differently?last, there are currently two 'hot-button' issues on the csm's plate, and you'll most likely take up the mantle of representing these when you become part of the csm. how would you resolve/handle the following issues:a) 0.0 mechanics (sovereignty, incentive, etc)b) mining (adding interest, balancing ores, etc)thank you for your time, and i just want to see how you'd handle the pressures inherent with being a csm delegate, should the public decide you worthy of said position."
3/25/2009,"i am not altogether sure this as straight forward a question as you think as most of what the csm does, from my understanding, happens behind closed doors and in part is covered by the nda. i wasn't privy to that sort of information with the 1st csm as some might think as jade kept star fraction and the csm role separate and took his nda seriously. the 2nd csm has also been as opaque in many ways as the first one. if we are to take what we see of the csm at face value though i personally think that in some cases on some issues there has been a little bit too much self interest governing the votes and not enough critical analysis of the subject concerned. the words 'critical' and 'analysis' you will see time and time again from me as it's what i do and more to the point what i do well. i hope that i could bring both of these to the csm from my 'training' as an academic in the humanities. simple answer to this one. jade and myself are separate people with separate and distinct personalities. many people attribute a certain pattern behavior too many groups in eve and beyond but this falls apart on close analysis. if you were to ask me what personal qualities i have that i think would be useful as a csm however i would say that i am easy going and able to think critically about issues both abstract and mundane. both of these i feel are important in a csm rep. it is also worth noting that whilst this, my main, character i chose to announce my candidacy on for the csm is a member and director of star fraction my intention is not to represent any one particular group but to weigh popular opinion on a subject with close analysis to help my fellow csm members reach a conclusion to present, or not, to ccp.as with most subjects i have a personal opinion on them (i.e. sov needs a change to increase the dynamics of 0.0 warfare beyond that of the current mechanics and adding the ability for any sized groups of people to create an infrastructure to support their mining/industry endeavors which isn't limited to location and/or sovereignty) but as previously stated the aim for me is to interact with the playerbase and analyse the solutions that have popular support. that isn't to say i shall except what the most people say but rather pass on ideas that bear up to critical analysis that warrant ccp's attention that the playerbase agree would help to increase their personal and group enjoyment of the game.and thank you for your questions. i am no politician and have no carefully designed platform to wave my banner over. as such what i am trying to ""sell"" so to speak is myself and the more questions i get the better so as to allow me to represent who i am to the voters and allow them to make up their own mind about me and whether i would represent them best or whether someone else would instead."

3/25/2009,"was one of the best teachers back at eve uni, used to teach alot of ecm classes what do you think of the proposed ecm changes dv?"
3/25/2009,"when i met the ccp devs in iceland last year it was interesting to see how worried they were about showing favouritism, something i've recently seen enforced by ccp in an unrelated case. if they actually made an exception for bob that would be extremely worrying, however i'm witholding judgement until their internal affairs department finishes their investigation (which i'm sure is going on atm). it could be a gm error and that would result in the name being changed back. it could be a change in policy, unfortunately ccp has shown repeatedly that synchronising its public documentation and internal policies/mechanics isnt one of their strong points.regardless, until ccp makes a statement nobody really knows what is going on. i'm confident someone on the current csm will bring this up (my guess would be darius johnson).edit: i just read ccp's reply here. ccp stated that they have done this before, and if this is true (i have no reason to think otherwise) then there has been a precendent and ccp did not show favouritism. that said, this seems to be another example of ccp failing to communicate properly. you'd think they'd learn eventually i hope one of the current csm's will force ccp to come with a better explanation of the process/decision though.first, lets keep in mind these are first-draft, proposed changes. nothing final yet and any of those changes wont make it into the game in a hurry.i think they're ridiculous (same for the sb changes). admittedly the 230km optimal range on my falcon (rigged for range, naturally) is maybe a bit too far (although imo thats what rokhs and other falcons are here to deal with), but removing the optimal bonus completely to turn an expensive but paper-thin ship into a close range fighter is ridiculous. a better solution would be to reduce the falcon's range bonus to 10-15% so its optimal would be in range of most sniper setups while it still has some combat viability. the rook with its existing damage and tank bonuses might be better suited for ccps visions for short range brawler. the scorpion is fine and i'm not sure why they want to change it. and the kitsune could use some love but oddly enough ccp seems to forget about that one.signal distortion amps are fine as they are i think - they do force ecm pilots to truly commit almost all of their ships slots to their ewar (gimping their damage and tank), but i feel that weakness justifies the strength of ecm modules.i may be a bit biased because i do fly ecm, but i think people forget too easily that for every time you curse because a falcon pilot jams you, there's another time when a jam fails and the falcon pilot can say bye bye to his ship. ecm is an all or nothing effect and people focus too much on the all and forget about the nothing."
3/25/2009,"i would like to thank you for your document on bounty hunting, and you were one of the brightest stars in csm1. unless i see another candidate which i think better captures my desires for this game, you have my vote. good luck, and kudos."

3/25/2009,"not a bad name, actually, as it gives you a psychological monopoly on reason and allows you to effortlessly paint your opponents as unreasonable by default."
3/25/2009,"considering how the csm has zero political power, creating a political party makes equally zero sense.it's an *advisory* council. it's not that you can influence the game design in such a way that would give those you claim for yourself to represent any advantage or greater consideration.this thread here proves once again how much egomania the csm is made up of and how little actual reason is behind it."
3/25/2009,what eve needs is an anti-metagaming party.
3/25/2009,"i don't think that's a fair statement, these folks get to meet ccp face to face and voice their opinions, some of it is bound to sink in even if the devs are actively trying to ignore them.there's no way to sit down and have a beer with someone and have absolutely zero impact."
3/25/2009,"except that, a party makes for a stronger route to communicate important issues the reps and being able to ascertain actual interest in the issue and ultimately be able to quantify that interest in terms of numbers of individuals who are aligned with that party. imo, might actually foster better ideas coming out of here. you let whatever party (ya know---whichever interest) privately debate/discuss/refine their ideas/issues before they bring it to the attention of the whole of the community. aside: a party might have the creativity and incentive to actually foster involvement, which i think everybody can agree is a good thing.i get that an idea like this might not work. but it certainly wouldn't cause any damage if it didn't."

3/25/2009,"apologies for the delay in replying, i was on a business trip..........i couldnt resist making the subject sound so outragous, it sometimes is the only way to illicit a reply.my point is communication csm's. yes, you may well be working hard, spending long meetings late into the small hours with ccp and feeling under appreciated by the inhabitants of eve. but many threads seemed to be opened over and over again and the same questions answered because pilots did not know that you guys had already been on the case. another thing, if there are petitions threads, and you know it is being looked into, post a link to the thread! if it is an issue that is not currently being looked at, dont be afraid to post a reply even if you just sit on the fence! look at the missile petition for instance - i cant see any csm response from that.however......i see a new 'issues' thread that has been stickied in assembly hall. this is certainly a start in improving lines of communication! i have just posted a link to the bombs issue to the stealth bomber petition in assembly hall. finally, the search engine that eveonline uses is absolutley rubbish. it does not allow pilots to research issues that have been previously raised and probably doesnt help csms in their cause.grz"
3/26/2009,"give us proper player owned structures. something that resembles and functions like a basic station in space, and not disparate lagfest of the bits and pieces we currently have. thank you."
3/26/2009,hell yeah i wanna see this!!!
3/26/2009,much <3 for chribba!
3/26/2009,i don't support this. one rule for everyone.
3/26/2009,agreed. also i couldn't care less about titan in amarr
3/26/2009,"went through amarr yesterday and you weren't there.i was disappointed.well the amarr navy was trying to shoot me so i couldn't linger, but i'll support you getting back where you belong."
3/26/2009,supported.
3/26/2009,for the love of god put this into the game ccp.naow!
3/26/2009,"i seem to recall a ccp dev mentioning that the pos code is huge. clearly a redesign would be a very large undertaking.that said they did write all that code in the first place so while a huge task it is a task they can manage else we would not even have pos.pos are clearly an integral part of eve now. they are not some fringe thing a few players dabble in but rather a fundamental basis in the game for thousands of players and numerous corps/alliances.and that despite pos (and by extension sov) mechanics being horrendous. i am sure ccp has a lot on their plate. even so this is well worth an effort. whatever changes may come this is absolutely money well spent.eta: as for csm it is their responsibility to bring this to the devs if the community demands it in sufficient strength. i think the devs will understand that the csm is merely carrying out their mandate and not hold it against individual csm members that they are bringing something the devs already said no to. the devs can of course say ""no"" again and be done with it but at least it sends the message to them that the playerbase keeps this particular issue high on their ""want"" list. as any business it behooves them to pay attention to what their customers want whether they can deliver on it or not."
3/26/2009,signed
3/26/2009,definitly not worth going for minmatar caps as it is.
3/26/2009,not supported. it's great entertainment as is and still a decent source of info is you care to do some shifting through the threads.
3/26/2009,ban goons
3/26/2009,dont screw with the tower's cpujust fix the launchers so they can work while a pos is reinforced.give a bonus to cal towers that allows missile arrays to still work while the pos is reinforced.either way supported
3/26/2009,i guess that sounds pretty resonable...
3/26/2009,"would fix the issue without screwing over genuine disconnects. may want to change that to still disappearing after 15 minutes though. there's nothing really wrong with the current 15min timer, it's avoiding that timer which is the issue."
3/26/2009,"every turret is visible (even if you cannot see the difference between t1 and t2) but even now, with two types of launchers for every caldari combat ship we still cannot look at them to see what they are fitting.is that a torp/cruise raven?is that a ham/heavy drake?is that a rocket/standard crow?who knows.i know that's a 1400mm fit tempest.i also know that megathron has neutrons.oh, look at that beam zealot..anybody else wish ccp would put a few guys onto designing some launcher models?"
3/26/2009,why not? supported.
3/26/2009,yeah.... i've always wanted to see missile launchers visually on ships.i'm all for it.
3/26/2009,"you raise a good point with the bit about looking to see what the enemy is fitting. also, i want to see just how ridiculous cruise launchers would look on stealth bombers. supported."
3/26/2009,"the devs say, ''the ships who have missile launcher hardpoints have the launcher thing on their models''but i want to see mah launchers turn around and spin and launch stuff"
3/26/2009,"this is something that's bugged me, too."
3/26/2009,"supportedmissiles come out of the center of our ships or on a random spot. it would be nice to see a launcher rise up on a ships hard points, fire a rocket into an empty area of space then track down the target."
3/26/2009,"supported. i do know that the devs are aware of this, however there are several technical things that need to be worked out before it can be implemented. hopefully we'll see it done though.--isaac"
3/26/2009,"surprisingly good suggestion, gasp"
3/26/2009,"yes, good idea. people will finally start laughing at me when i fit assault missile launchers on the drake!in all seriousness, it would only make sense if it was implemented."
3/26/2009,"yes, it is time to move the damn missile away from the broken spawning in the center. i want visible missile launchers which launch missiles just like turrets have now.caldari need love."
3/26/2009,i'd like to see this idea taken the whole way and have every module (even the mid and lowslots) and rig on a ship visually represented in some way.
3/26/2009,"sorry lavista, i knew you supported it.i just saw it as we are all human and can sometimes forget so i was bumping it"

3/26/2009,"previously one just had to anchor a can at the warp-in point of a moon and it prevented someone from putting a pos there until the can was destroyed. this mechanic was changed so that pos's ignored anchored cans. now it is common practice in high-sec to anchor a tower at a moon and just keep it offline to ""reserve"" or ""sell"" the moon. whereas previously with a can you could just destroy it with enough firepower without declaring war, with pos towers offline you have to declare war on the owner before you can attack it to clear the moon to use. i feel this mechanic is worse then with cans. destroying a large faction tower in high-sec from a corp in a huge empire alliance setup to make wars expensive is unfair for anyone who wants to use that moon.i would like to see some kind of mechanic be introduced to prevent this kind of moon reserving to make it fair for others to come and use the moon if it's not in use. either make a tower unanchor after a period of time from being offline (few weeks), or allow people to shoot offline towers without being in war in high-sec, or some other method."
3/26/2009,sounds like more support for the idea of being able to hack/salvage/unanchor offline towers - all good ideas.
3/26/2009,use a different moon if you don't want to blow up an offline tower?
3/26/2009,imho if your going to play stupid little jerk games like that (anchoring offlined towers to lock moons) you should be under penalty.the towers should be online and fueled to do that.if its offline... you have 24-36 hours or the tower self destructs along with all the other equipment if not become steal-able.simple..efficient... and forces people to be more active and not a bunch of lazy morons.
3/26/2009,"if you look at 0.7, 0.6 and 0.5 systems anywhere near jita, you'll find maaany with just offline towers, most of which is just a tower, no other modules. finding a free moon anywhere near jita is nearly impossible. thats where the issue lies. there is no incentive to unanchor a tower, if your not going to be running your pos, because it's so hard to get a moon, just leave the tower offline, the chances are someone will declare war and be able to blow it up isn't that great. i'm just proposing some sorta incentive to not leave it offline, like it will get blown up easier.another option would be to just make offline pos's subject to the system trash cleanup, so after a month they vanish. that would also solve it. if you don't online your pos for a whole month, you deserve it to vanish, imho."
3/26/2009,how about hiring mercs and let them blow up the offline pos?wouldn't that be possible?
3/26/2009,"well sure, but it seems to me that this is just defeating some of the purpose that allowing towers to ignore anchored cans did. the idea then was to prevent moons from being ""reserved"" or tied up. anchored cans have immense hp, but so does a tower. you just don't need to declare war to shoot a can."
3/26/2009,"fun fact: if a tower is offline, you can use close-range gank bs and the only thing you have to worry about is if the corp shows up to defend it~furthermore, there shouldn't be a stront timer because the tower is offline, so you can do it in one go."
3/26/2009,"true.. but you have to declare war to do so... fairly expensive if the corp is in one of those 500 corp empire alliances that exist only to make war's expensive. if you didn't have to declare war in high-sec, then i agree that would be a good solution. but having to declare war to clear a moon seems excessive. but maybe that's just me?"
3/26/2009,"i've even seen reserved moons in low sec, so i can imagine how bad it is in high sec. fix it."
3/26/2009,thumbs up from me.perhaps changing the mechanic so anyone canun-anchour a tower after it has been offline for something like 7 days?this may also have a benefit to 0.0 sov war by enabling some kind of ability to siege. locking the enemy logistics would become a strategic tool again.zos
3/26/2009,"well this isn't really an issue for 0.0, since a single dread would tear up any offline pos, but in high-sec you're limited to battleships at most, and you have to declare war. for small corps and such declaring war on a big alliance just to get a moon in high-sec that someone has forgot about, isn't using or is just ""reserving"" seems a bit excessive. when viewed against the game mechanics that was changed to prevent cans from ""holding"" a moon, this just seems to be the same issue. although the can now is more expensive, but it makes it less likely someone would shoot it due to having to declare war."
3/26/2009,"too bad your premise is completely wrong.. anchorable containers are protected as assets of the individual/corp and shooting them is the same as shooting anything else in possession of the player, and that is, will drop concord on you like a ton of bricks, if the 2-50 mil it costs for you to dec the corp that dropped 200+ mil to get the tower out there isnt worth your time to take it out then that is too bad."
3/26/2009,"war dec, hire mercs, ask the corp in question to take their tower down, find a free moon in a quiet area, go to lowsec. there are plenty of methods available, unfortunately as most of them involve interaction with other people they are not suitable for some of the more extreme mouth breathing carebear elements of highsec."
3/26/2009,bumpulus.
3/26/2009,"go pod some boggeril; they drop banjos. oh, wait...."
3/26/2009,"two trains of thought come to mind when i see this idea.i like it. the concept of smokey bars in a station where the pilots gather to drink and play games of chance or hammer out deals in ill-lit back corners makes sense. that and there are drugs in the game already which are pretty nasty. so they do have the precedent for this already established. the thing is that its all ""text-based"" at the moment, not actually being seen done and i think that will be the difference. people react badly to the concept of smoking and drug use and in ambulation it would be visible useage, so i could see thier point if they don't include it because it might be seen as them saying ""smoking & drug use is cool"". still .. i am an adult and i don't let videogames tell me what to do. so i vote yes. its a nasty nitty gritty space world and the ciggy hanging from the mouth as u play a game of cards in the seedy space station bar works for me."
3/26/2009,"supported, if only for the hilarity of smoke-filled bars in jita/rens/dod/ours.oh, hey zed o/"
3/26/2009,should also add a nice selection of luxury food and drinks
3/26/2009,"e-peen, sure, but they're also the single best source of long-run intelligence about an enemy in the game. if you want to know combat info about a pilot, look up his killboard stats. plus, people like things like that - having a record ofm what they killed, knowing what valuable faction mods could have dropped but didn't, and this is still a game. also, watching pirates whine is just pathetic - nobody wants to see that."
3/26/2009,supported for exactly this reason.
3/26/2009,"""hey guys, we just sank a battleship, and the divers say it had 16"" guns, not 12"" like we thought. the americans caught a couple more a while back, posted the info on kriegsmarineclinic, told us they were kitted out the same. you think maybe the germans up-gunned their navy while we weren't looking?""""nah, let's just ignore it and assume things with no basis in fact instead. gathering intel is like cheating, right?""there's a reason i've never uploaded a kill to a killboard, and it's because i don't want to advertise what i fly and what i fit. if other people want to pass around their valuable information like beer at a frat-house kegger, though, i'm going to take advantage of it."
3/26/2009,"i'd rather people just said yes or no to be honest, people are using intel as a reason which is a bit funny tbh, the poster above me used a real life example of how some divers could find more guns on an enemy ship, surely it would be better to find out that info before the fight even happened? (which you are capable of in eve), to think you could find out a ships fit from an explosion in space is also ridiculous, lastly the above poster pointed out that you should not post your losses for all to see? i have just looked on battleclinic and i'm showing 384 kills and 98 losses, do you want to know how many of those i have actually posted? the answer to that is ""0"", i have never posted one kill or loss on that site and yet my set-ups are there for not only my enemies to see, but for anyone who cares to know, they have not had to work hard at all to find this info out. as i said earlier, this info is for e-peen and nothing else.------------------------------------------------------------"
3/26/2009,"no. killmails are fine. just ignore em if you hate them.there, simple enough?!--isaac"
3/26/2009,hate double posts
3/26/2009,"i say just yes and no when the debate is self-explanatory. this one isn't, and so i explain. dude, sci-fi game. you don't watch the pretty explosion, you send a probe out to pick through the wreckage and figure out what blew up. thing is, that's so automatic that they don't even ask you, that's the sort of crap your bridge crew does. they just sent you the mail through concord as a joke - given how often we kill our crews, they need a laugh every now and then. more seriously, there are two parties in every kill. both will, reasonably speaking, know what happened in the fight. if one publicizes it and the other keeps it secret, well, it's still public. again, i'll pull out the ww2 analogies(been playing too much hearts of iron lately...) - there were a whole lot of real, historical battles where one side publicized the results and the other didn't. of course, those featured a lot more lying and forcible repression of data than eve does, but the point still stands - if the japanese don't want to talk about midway because they screwed up, but the americans trumpet their monumental victory, then the germans read the battle report and still get a pretty good idea of what happened. they'll certainly know if the americans start talking about how one particular spot of armour is thin, that they should probably aim for that spot if they ever start fighting japan. the japanese don't like it much, but they don't have a whole lot of control over it. your opponents are posting their combat experiences for the world to see, and for better or worse, you're in it. like i said above, if they want to pass out valuable information for free, they can do that. you don't, i don't, but others do, and there's no sensible way we can stop them from doing so, either in the context of the universe or the context of the game. um, i just gave a concrete example of something else it's used for, and you agreed with my claim."
3/26/2009,leave my kill mails alone! some of us like stats. go f off!
3/26/2009,"it's a pvp game. killmails are how combat pilots keep score. scores are kept in every game. if anything, eve doesn't have enough combat statistics. stats are fun. i love the stats in games such as battlefield and i am not that great at that game."
3/26/2009,"thw killmails are not only matter of e-peen but also tells you who in your corp is not so good in pvp and how you can help him to get better. and the information getting form enemy killmail is very valuble information in terms of setup, location and playing time."
3/26/2009,worst idea since greedo shooting first.
3/26/2009,"now now, let's not say things we can't take back."
3/26/2009,"tl;dr: not just no, but hell no.longer version:while i can certainly understand the frustration of some players (myself included) at the protections that npc corps provide to those who aren't deserving of those protections (salvage thieves, macro miners, etc) the fact of the matter is there's no real reason to force players out of them.some players (again, myself included) really just want to be left the hell alone. i chose to leave an npc corp because frankly, i got tired of being bothered by all the stupid people in the corporate chat channel. i joined a small corporation so i could, in fact, be left more alone than i was before. sure i can be wardec'd now, but i'm willing to risk that to have more control over who's on the party line they call corp chat.other players genuinely enjoy the huge player base in the npc corp. they like helping out newer players, teaching them the ropes of the game, helping them choose a path, what have you, and that's a lot easier to do, in terms of communication, if you happen to be in the same corp.finally, some players are just plain lazy. it's not that they like being in an npc corp - they just don't want to go through the effort of finding a new one.the point is, none of these people should be forced out of an npc corp just because you don't think they should be allowed to stay there."
3/26/2009,"some of it is, some of it isn't. for example, you can't help out new players in corp chat if you're in a one-man. and more to the point, you're forced into being wardecable - sort of the point of this whole endeavour - which is one thing a lot of players will find very distasteful. i've known several people who have complained that they can't stay in a player corp for a month without getting decced, and that will drive people away pretty severely. also, i've never set up a corp myself, but doesn't it require some amount of skill and/or isk? i know it's not the month and a billion alliance-making takes, but it's more effort than a lot of people will want to put in.you also still haven't addressed the problem of having a corp with thousands of incoherent, undefended members that can be wardecced. i'm sure the privateers will love you, but seriously, it is a gaping flaw in your proposal, because at present you're not advocating vulnerability, you're advocating mass suicide."
3/26/2009,i kind a like this idea.i support.
3/26/2009,would you like a box of tissues with that?all i see is a pathetic whelp of a pilot who will not read... who will not think.. and who will not do research.all he does is answer arguments made by very intelligent pilots with stupid lame assed excuses and in total denial of reality.do i troll that? oh hell yes.
3/26/2009,"drake, i love you, but you troll everything."
3/26/2009,what can i say... i'm your evil twin brother.
3/26/2009,"normally i would vote yes on such a thing, but ever since the 94% skill nerf to new characters, i now have to say no."
3/26/2009,for the 100th time in the 100th thread that is merely re-saying the same thing for the 100th time.no.
3/26/2009,"no thanks. you shouldent have to force players to experience the game. its a little bit rude, and will not win any long term subscribers.the noob corps should be there to filter out those who dont want to play co-operativally, they will either discover that co-op play is more rewarding or they will abandon the game eventually, to set a time limit on this is, as mentioned rude."
3/26/2009,"in short, exactly the same thing that's been proposed 1000 times before and rejected by everyone. force players out of npc corps into a decable (own) corp if they want to or not(so we can shoot the crap out of the newbees, but just don't want to say that out loud)and again, the answer everybody gives is the same as the previous 1000 times. no thanksedit:the only way i could see something like this happening is with some kind of conscious decision from the player in question. for instance (and this is just an example), you can not train t2 skills while in a non-decale corporation or return to one if you have them. join a decable npc or player corp.you want to fly and/or use t2? you take the decision and face the music (or guns )something like that. but it has to be left up to the player, and be a decent level skill( or skillgroup)."
3/26/2009,"not supported.if they can't stay in these corps most will just quit, which would be bad for ccp and worse for you, they are your in-game customers, who else buys all the faction crap?edit: when it comes to high-sec alts, you may have a point."
3/26/2009,tl;dr : /thread
3/26/2009,what possible reason could (mission farmers) / (macro miners) / (all the other people who would be the main target of war decs) have for leaving the complete safety of npc corps?
3/26/2009,ah gee... lets think about that... hmm/me scratches beardwell... uh... how about the ability to use pos's?corp hanger?teamwork? larger gangs/fleets?wow... i guess that was so hard for you to figure out.... musta hurt like hell.glad i could be of help.
3/26/2009,95% tax.
3/26/2009,"yes, because that will clearly force all the miners into player corps."
3/26/2009,"each race's ewar compliments their tactics, except for caldari. here i draw out new caldari ewar that more closely follows the pattern of the other races.race: tacticprimary: long-range ewar generally used by only one racesecondary: short-range ewar often used by all racesamarr: big slow laser shipsprimary: tracking disruptor - decrease tracking on gallente and minmatar gunboats.secondary: nos/neuts - bomb capacitor for speed ships and active tanks.minmatar: fast ships and gunboatsprimary: target painter - increase signature on targetssecondary: webs - tackling from speed shipsgallente: close range blasters, drone boatsprimary: rsd - restricts engagement rangesecondary: warp disruption - forces engagementso the goal here is to model caldari ewar off of the other races' pattern, but tool them to benefit caldari engagement tactics.caldari: long range rails and missilesproposed primary: range dependent ecm - higher strength close up forces long range engagements, where caldari ships have an advantage. redesign the mechanic to look more like periodic focused bursts, where the frequency of instantaneously breaking locks depends on the strength of the jam, rather than the current chance-based timers.proposed secondary: inertia field - a new ewar module that decreases ship agility could be used to catch ships out of alignment and force tight orbits out to longer distances and subsequently a lower transversal.both effects give an advantage to range-independent missile systems and longer-ranged, slower-tracking railguns.edit: bumping mechanic needs to be changed if inertia field is to be implemented, too powerful side by side"
3/26/2009,supported... if only for the hilarity of inertia fielding autopiloting freighters.
3/26/2009,only if bumping is nerfed completelyotherwise... not supported.
3/26/2009,how so? it's a little vague and i don't see the connection to ewar.
3/26/2009,bumping is the current tactic for preventing a ship from aligning.if your going to make a module that nerfs your agility which slows your ships ability to align... then bumping is nothing more than pure greifing compounded by this module.you can't have it both ways...people won't use the module by default because bumping does the same job...but those who have the module will bump and jam the agility of a ship.balance mechanics would make it an utter nightmare.so in short... bumping goes... or your ewar idea goes.not both.
3/26/2009,"ok i see where you're coming from. the inertia field is more of a tactic for slow long range ships - mostly as an anti-interceptor module that counters fast tight orbits by reducing agility, possibly forcing close-range ships outside their optimal ranges.using the module to slow align-times is a secondary tactic - but i see how it can be a huge bumping buff. if bumping were changed so ships didn't spin around in different directions, that would fix the issue. good catch though, thanks.edit: also the inertia field isn't nearly as important as the change in ecm mechanicsedit2: yes i think bumping ought to be removed completely, the inertia field is a more consistent mechanic for slowing align times."
3/26/2009,im stunned... a goon who dosen't act like a goon.nicely stated chap.i'll keep an eye out for yah.
3/26/2009,"drake raises a good point, but it's ultimately minor. the overall proposal here, of making caldari ew fit into racial tactics instead of just being a win button, is a good one. i think that the issue of range can be solved by dropping optimal, increasing falloff, and maybe upping strength a little, which would make it a weapon for short-range engagement denial(so that they have to fight at long range to get around the jams), instead of long range pwnage. that's dangerous - at least the strength-increasing part - but something along those lines might be justifiable, and that seems to be what the devs are thinking, broadly, right now. in a similar vein rsd ranges need to go way up - you can't deny a long-range fight if your ew can't hit at long range. yes, this means that the ew range is exactly inverted from the range on the rest of the racial stuff, but that's actually kind of appropriate on the whole. as for the inertia field suggestion, it's interesting, but i wonder whether it'd actually see use or just feel like a waste of a module. i suppose if it was like -90% or something crazy it'd see use, but it's not a very powerful effect in most contexts, and i don't think it really does what you want it to do in terms of caldari racial tactics. pushing ranges out from 5 km to 10, and even then only if the enemy is trying to orbit, is not the sort of thing that a rokh is desperately looking for when a blaster mega jumps him. if you want to give caldari a secondary, consider smartbombs. it's a bit weird, and i'm not sure it'd work, but they're short-range weapons that make quick work of drones, which makes them a near-perfect weapon against the racial enemy. or perhaps, in a similar vein, make ecm burst a whole lot better, especially against drones. again, not sure if it'd work, but as theorymongering goes, it seems like a decent enough starting point."
3/26/2009,"i'd have to disagree with this as being fundamentally wrong tactics wise... most ships that can lock you in time to use the inertia field on you can easily drop a point on you, negating the necessity of bumping your ship around. while i do agree that bumping is a craptacular tactic, i don't think in correlation someone is going to use an inertial field instead of a point to keep you pinned down via bumping instead of just actually pointing you. most close range ships wouldn't need the module, and most long range ships wont want to be close enough to bump you anyways... i truly think this idea has merit."
3/26/2009,"interesting and well thought idea. however i agree with drake, remove bumping before we let this in. --isaac"
3/26/2009,"yes, unless they're a supercapital, sitting on a station, sitting on a gate, or sitting on a pos shield. escape is not always accomplished via warp."
3/26/2009,"most supercapitals use cyno jumping as their means of escape, for which bumping would have no effect..."
3/26/2009,"even if it is little bit older thread i think it would be very useful. as some people blocklist contains hundreds of blocked people due ot the recruitment channel, jita scams etc it would be very nice feature to be able to export and import the blocklist."
3/26/2009,where do i sign for my wtfpwnships?
3/26/2009,"i do see what you are suggesting, however all ships are not intended to point.there are obviously some ships designed to tackle, those get the primary, secondry, tertiary points. then whatever others in fleet should simply spread them aound. the larger the fleet engagment, the longer it will last, and the more targets your tacklers will rotate through to keep the victim ships held down.another issue here is that essentially you are giving every ship an extra mid. the balance of ships ability to tank etc could be seriously upset.thumbs down from me sorry.zos"
3/26/2009,lol. that was only a suggestion - i dare say the penalties should be significantly stiffer. my point was the op didn't mention penalties at all (that i noticed).
3/26/2009,"maybe shield tankers should get the residual boost this would give. as it stands now fc's rofl at the thought of someone bringing a shield tanker to battles. i myself have heard on numerous occasions, ""shield tanker! lol let him die!"" as it stands pvp is almost solely the realm of armor tankers.one of the main reasons behind this suggestion is to help bring back 1v1, small gang engagements and add some flavor to them. one on one's are hard to find and when you do its usually the same ships. this would add more variety to your engagements ... bigger box o' chocolates, if you will.yes i did. -300 calibration severly limits your further rigging options. plus, i have provided possible options for further penalties a couple posts ago."
3/26/2009,my amarr af alt would love any of these ideas. 1 extra midslot would be happiness.
3/26/2009,"supported, but only if the rig 1) gimps your cpu/pg 2) gimps your resists, and 3) is cheap and easy to produce. oh, and one for the low slot would be interesting too. of course, the 8-slot limit should still apply.but, as someone had said, the shield tanking for fleets would finally be (as) viable (as armor) with this implemented."
3/26/2009,"ok before i say this i want to say i do not have this skill trained, ofc this was a critical skill for probers before the update if it was all about time but now whats the point of this skill?trained to lv 5 which would take around 18/20 days would reduce your scan time of each scan by...wait for it...5 seconds!this skill got no love from ccp with the new update lol, oh and the worse thing of it is that this skill does not even open up any other skills or mods at any level, again ccp, where is the love?what i suggest for this skill is to increase the warp speed of probes by a large amount, if ccp insist on keeping this skills benefit time based then why not? 5 seconds off each scan is no incentive imo, then again maybe this is another one of those skill that is intended to go to the skill grave yard.so i say increase the warp speed of probes by 20% per level as well and the 20% to scan speed, i think this would encourage the training of it...maybe."
3/26/2009,"i didn't do probing before the changes, but my understanding is that it was nothing special then either. and as it is, given normal probe warp times, training it to 5 reduces your scan time by about 25%. remember, it's not 5 seconds, it's closer to a minute for an average scanning-out, since you have to do a dozen scans(roughly) to find what you're looking for. probably not worth training to 5, but it's hardly unique in that regard - we've already got 28 weapon specialization skills that fit that bill, what's one more? train it to 4 and be happy."
3/26/2009,"its useful. i see no problems with this skill. if your truly serious about scanning, you'll do it to five. if your not, you won't. no support.--isaac"
3/26/2009,"supported, the change really made this skill pointless, at least i only trained it to level 4"
3/26/2009,yes! cookies!!!
3/26/2009,hey hey just a simple request really. could there be a new forum specifically for wormhole and all things sleeper ?with the addition of epic arcs (yet to be seen) the missions forum is becomming very cluttered. wormholes/cosmos/complexes/epic arcs/general npc etc i feel that the community would benefit from a more specific wormhole forum. if you look in the mission forum its littered with wh threads and the mission ones and the epic arc ones drop rapidly off the page with the influx of the retail players and generally new players it would be beneficial to seperate the two. many thanksmikal dreyshattered crystal - the best place for all your online codes
3/26/2009,nothing against it...so why the **** not? =p
3/26/2009,"i don't read missions and complexes much, but what it sounds like is that you're being flooded in fotm threads, which will die down fairly soon. even if wormholes remain popular, mechanic-discovery threads will go away, as will a lot of the ""okay, how does this work?"" threads. i expect it'll settle down within a month or so. if it's still flooded with threadson one topic that bump all the otehrs down, then i might support this, but for now i'd prefer to wait and see."
3/26/2009,"revert the race you mean. i hear from old vets that caldari boats used to be excellent pvp ships. a continuous digression from torpedo's that can strike at 100km to battleships speed tanking cruise missiles i still have a raven in my hangar though, it looks mean so long as it isn't shooting at anything."
3/26/2009,"too bad naomi's bloodline is khanid/amarr, not caldari."
3/26/2009,<- was drunk. i apologize.
3/26/2009,thanks definately needed in some form and thanks
3/26/2009,"i'm sure it's a good starting point but the entire alliance structure needs to be made more efficient.as it stands an alliance is not it's own identity when it comes to contract/corporate/insurance payouts and this really needs to be addressed.the idea of alliance roles, with of course the ability to decide who has these roles for how long and when would enable alliances to further their member corporations ability and reach by allowing clear lines of what is alliance assets and what is corp assets. of course there would still be arguements but it should be a lot more black and white as to who (personal/corp/alliance) owns what (anything in game from a shuttle to the bpo capital set), and who can interact with items stored at an alliance office.the suggestions are a good start, but there needs to be more emphasis on the identity and ownership at the alliance level, so you have my support for what it's worth."
3/26/2009,"then what exactly would constitute proof for you? any evidence regarding the punishment of a ccp employee in regards to a game which is the intellectual property of ccp will, amazingly enough, have to come from ccp. and any communication with the public from ccp is going to be ""pr"" (thats 'public relations'), so therefore, any evidence that comes from them will be disregarded by you, according to your own arguments. therefore, where's the point in arguing with you, when you are going to deny proof when you see it?seriously, take yourself outside, learn some logic, then come back and argue. i don't know if lavista is right or not, but you are an idiot."
3/26/2009,and just how do you know they are even there?all this mumbo jumbo and conspiracy crap... no evidence..no proof./me dons tinfoil hat.seriously... you people are making me laugh so hard..its hilarious.
3/26/2009,"hah, this is too funny.a list of all my alts is publicly available on the forum.i don't post with alts. i believe in what i say and i'll happily smack somebody on their forehead if they are being too stupid, without using an alt."
3/26/2009,"so because ccp actively engages in conversation with us about key issues(which we of course can't publish or talk about), we are by definition useless?sorry, your logic is fundamentally flawed. it's nothing but circular reasoning."
3/26/2009,"technicalities differs from game to game. i was gm (game master) in a game where i ""only"" had access to commands to unstuck players, invisibility, teleport around etc. only the developers were able to alter stats and spawn items and npcs. i.e. ""a higher grade gm""'s. i wasn't aware that eve was at such low level that below-gm's can spawn items.. that's remarkable.hint, that's sarcasm. try see the point.i'm merely showing ccp's behaviour (a pattern that is the key to my whole proposal), and not discussing the case in hand. i made an effort to really point out that i tried to post it as neutral as possible.if you have to know, i supported the ghost training changes (it's posted in those threads, go read if you want).it was marketed to include a ""game time card"" (the box says 60 day game time), as well as ""advanced career guide"" (which in the box is constantly referring to the online guide that already exist), and a ""vip pass"" (which is a pamphlet with info of how to use the buddy program on this site) as well as a ""special edition ship"".you could argue that the guide and vip pass is delivered as promised, the game time card and ship however isn't, as they're ""tied"" to each other. you have to use the gtc on a fresh account to get the ship, and you can't even use a buddy program invite (i.e. fresh account) use the gtc for this. thus, circumventing the free trial. i.e. effectively a loss of parts of the 60d time.so basicly you have no freedom to chose how to use the gtc. technically the things are delivered, but the text (the communication to the customer) is a work-around. ""buy 2 and get 3rd for free (but the first two had their prices upgraded so essentially you pay for 4)"". technically correct, horribly customer communication, and treatment. you don't get what the box implies that it delivers.again, the key here is to show ccp's behaviour/communication towards customers.you are being silly and didn't read my post. the situation in itself is not the issue, i'm arguing ccps behaviour. it's very simple. read the rules for name changes. it's clearly stated noone will get a name change, unless the name is offensive etc. i didn't ignore the case that a single gm might be behind this. it's perfectly in line with what i posted - poor customer communication from ccp. rogue, or inexperienced gm's? that should be subject to proper information/introduction. the company are responsible for their employees. they are responsible for their eduction and behaviour.space adding up, posting the other replies in following post ->"
3/26/2009,"i didn't read the nyt article about the csm fyi. at the time of the t20 incident i was very curious to follow how ccp would treat this case. in the game where i was gm we had multiple situations where gm's (of higher/lower levels) were involved in several situations similar to this.my interest here was not only as a player regarding ""game balance"". i know that's a subjective thing. the case i followed here was to see how ccp would try solve this. again, i'll try avoid discussing the cases itself, so let's get to the red line that goes through all the things i presented here; ccp's communication with their customers/players.in light of the t20 incident, ccp promised us an internal affairs division, as well as the csm ""to add transparency"". i remember very little else of what was promised back then, but i know that's the exact key phrase they used regarding csm. ""transparency"". csm was supposed to deliver players an insight and control mechanism to see that ccp did their best to avoid another t20.the rest is an after-construction. i'm pretty sure both you and me see why. ccp wanted a solution, came up with this ""cool idea""; and then let it get its own life and develop. it's the exact same approach they do to eve, which is part of why it's a successful game. however, while this is innovative when creating a game, it's horrible for customer relations as it's a 100% certain that the promised product will never be delivered (since it has its own life, evolve, and change).csm has run it's course, it's about to shut it down. it never got off to do what it was supposed to, and it evolved into something that isn't needed.perhaps if you instead of trying to find arguments on the particular cases, but instead reading the whole picture that is provided - the red line/theme going through, then you'd see what the post was about.i admit it was a bit long, but i clearly made an effort not to discuss the single cases. the details in them isn't interesting. what's interesting is how ccp respond to it. the rest would just be arguing semantics back and forth and noone would ever be ""right"" since it's a matter of opinions.what's interesting is to see how ccp however really could use some help on how to address big changes to their customers. and how csm is doing little of significance, being virtually useless and throwing away money that could be better spent.that's what this post is about."
3/26/2009,"i wonder where you got the idea of conspiracy theory. did you read my post? i don't think there's a conspiracy anywhere, and if someone is trolling here, it's you."
3/26/2009,i'm 8 weeks off from flying a rev and i want my gigantic spotlights
3/26/2009,set new bookmark and adjust the warp times.besides the smart macros handle themselves once they get to the belts. all you are doing with this is hurting starting miners and forcing them to use the probing system that they will be completely clueless about.
3/26/2009,anything that can reduce the amount of minerals on the market and make ship prices go up gets a big thumbs down from me.
3/26/2009,"aight dig it,a dawg know him runnin, but speakin as a dawg an not a top dawg in a race, a dawg ask a dawg like a dawg ask a dawg:what does a dawg do to make recycling and recovery better business? a dawg see last time you dont say much about it so what about now?be safe"
3/26/2009,o/ o/ extreme
3/26/2009,"and political parties make csm politics much more interesting, let's not forget. i'm still concerned that by having a carebear party you'll end up with innately restrictive practices being forced on the csm to give to ccp - ""remove meta 0 loot from missions/rats"" would harm the isk supply of independent mission-runners at the expense of t1 manufacturers, for example, and therefore make private enterprise that much harder. again, i am all for a party that campaigns for private enterprise, sandbox gameplay and other liberal values."
3/26/2009,"due all respect, i think that important aspects to the issue in question is being ignored in your argument.there's many aspects which has to be considered when we discuss that very issue.1. do mission-runners make enough isk?2. should they make less?the whole idea is that t1 manufacturing is not worth it, because of the abundance that comes from loot.if the carebear party is made up by smart people like issler, then i'm certain that it won't end up with innately restrictive practices."
3/26/2009,"this is my point. i have nothing against advocacy groups, but when you say things like ""i think the party could make its goal to maintain the freedom to enjoy eve with the widest variety of styles of play"", you're obviously misrepresenting the truth of the situation. your goal is not to defend a variety of styles of play, it's to represent one style of play. there's nothing wrong with that, but please be honest with yourself. also, the reason nobody cares yet is that we still have a week before nominations even close. we have more serious, declared candidates in the race now than we did at this point last time. my understanding of the reasoning for this party is improved voter relations, not improved ccp lobbying. it doesn't require the csm to have a huge amount of power for it to be effective in that role."
3/26/2009,"doc, all due respect, but attempting to defeat a fundamentally good idea (such as reliable representation for at least a moderately sized portion of the player base) by putting an idea into their mouths and then playing kick the can with it is hardly a fair litmus test as to whether there would be any value in creating a 'party'.especially, when i would think with the proper leadership---your average so called 'carebear' will be infinitely better armed with information and guidance, thus producing infinitely more realistic and constructive issues. hersh,i don't get it. spell it out for me. seeing as the basics of carebearism seems to be ""leave me alone, i'm trying to build a sand castle here"", it's highly unlikely that their interests will otherwise disrupt anybody else's game---unless of course somebody else's game is harassing people who just want to do their own thing with some friends---at which point----ho hum, advocacy works/ everybody wins."
3/26/2009,"how left alone should they be, though? there's a lot of bearish miners out there who think that can-flipping mechanics are fundamentally broken, for example - leaving them alone is possible, but it'd negatively impact the gameplay of the flippers. or a bit more to the point, look at ankh's campaign to nerf suicide ganking in csm 1 - a carebear csmer(don't let the fw stats fool you) who used her position to launch a direct attack at a pvp career choice and succeeded. now, i'm not saying that her position was wrong - on the contrary, i largely agreed with it - but it was a bear's argument that did negatively impact other people. remember the old chestnut about this being eve online and not hello kitty online - harassment is a perfectly normal and acceptable part of eve's gameplay. yes, it can be tweaked up or down, but those harassers are playing eve too, and their choice of sand castle to build(in this case, one of delicious salty tears and the occasional loot drop) is just as legitimate as yours. the two do come into conflict sometimes, and that has to be acknowledged."
3/26/2009,"great! hop back into those trees so hopefully we can all miss the forest!look, i'm not here to debate what the appropriate can flipping mechanic is nor do i, at this point, maintain any opinion on exactly how ""left alone"" folks should be in high sec when they're mining, nor to even judge a definition of left alone. it's overly detailed and not pertinent to the discussion. it's probably an argument that's been had here a thousand times and with bringing it up as a universal straw man, it will probably be had a thousand times more. what's actually being talked about here is what, if any, value might their be to creating a streamlined point for players of similar ilk to constructively provide their interests to one or more csm members. save your can flipping stuff for when/if this theoretical organization materializes and when/if they even bring this up in their internal discussions and when/if they decide to bring it to the attention of the general community."
3/26/2009,"actually, i want to make sure i understand what's being said here hersh:you're not suggesting that jetcanners (herein, ""potential victims"") don't have a right to as much vocal and meaningful advocacy as the flippers do, right?i don't think that's what you're saying, but i want to be sure."

3/27/2009,instead of -cap/second t2 long range ammo should give a bonus to cap/recharge. its not a lot to ask since most fleet bs lack exactly that - cap. and also because there is already the low-damage of long range ammo's and gimped tracking. so that kind of small bonus would make it more usable.perhaps the tracking of short range lazer/blaster/missile(expl velocity here) should be looked into as well.or some sort of other bonus or something would certainly be a nice addition to t2 ammo.
3/27/2009,"can't support this topic as it's unclear what is being asked for....i would definitely support a buff for *shortrange* t2 ammo - the reason it's so cheap is not because it's easy to produce - it's bacause there is no demand due to the fact that it has crippling drawbacks for no noticable benefit - as it stands if you're using void / hail etc, you're doing something wrong!i would not support nerf of faction ammo however - and since that is a concievable inference of the thread title i can't support it."
3/27/2009,"another additional note is that you could potentially add an option to allow current customers through the shield. this would avoid having to hand out passwords, and deal with the constant re-requests for forgotten passwords."
3/27/2009,good idea but i don't think it will happen in this form.i would rather see a silo system employed. everything goes into and out of the silo.the corporation can still anchor silos inside cause they own the pos but the old rules applybut for non corp membersthe only way to prevent abuse would be to have the silos anchored outside of the shields.the person who wants to rent anchors there silo and agrees to a connection charge to the research platform.so the silo would be owned by a person not a corpthis way protects the researcher and is a much simpler method. you simply pay for the connection charge when you insert a job and you get disconnected when it is complete.and as far as all those silos you could make a research beacon of grid from the pos. so you anchor the beacon and everyone who wants to rent goes to the beacon and anchors the silo there. ccp can even limit the number of anchored silo's.and for those that want to spam have a count down say 15 days after your job ends your silo gets unanchored if you don't que a new job. so you forget about your silo and someone can steal it.of course you would never employ this system in lowsec or 0.0 but then again why would you even want too. so yes you are on the right track but no to your current implementation.
3/27/2009,"i don't see how the researcher having to haul and anchor a structure, one that is unprotected outside the bubble, is better for the researcher. the same amount of effort would still be required on the billing side for your 'connection fee' as a simple locker rent would be, only this allows the pos owner to control placement/options better. what risk do you see the researcher having under my storage array idea? and how would them using their own facility unprotected connected to the owner's pos be any better?"

3/27/2009,"/massive signed for original posti'd do it just a wee bit different, though. i think that the nag is quite capable of being quite the pain-dealer on its own without extra/different guns.naglfar: 1 extra mid, no change in lows, significant cpu boost, moderate cap boost.-it's possible to almost permatank a naglfar, but it's not easy and you need several faction mods to do it, and even then, other capitals do it much better and easier.nidhoggur: 1 extra mid, 1 fewer low (like how it was before), significant cpu boost, moderate cap boost.-this is the wierdest capital. it gets bonuses to shield transfers, but its cpu suffers so bad that it can't fit but one if you're lucky. trying to fit a capital shield xfer with a shield tank on a nidhoggur is like trying to pull teeth on a sabretooth tiger, to boot. it's doable, but again, you need several faction mods to do it where with a chimera such things aren't necessary. here, permatanking is also possible, but again, it needs to be fully rigged and have faction mods to do the job to even pray to come close to the efficacy of other carriers. tanking aside, its bonuses are geared toward being a logistics freak, but again, that cpu issue gets in the way of its ability to fit a tank and logistics mods.p.s. - capital modules should be 500-1000 m3. not 4,000 m3.edit - the main idea here is to have all capitals be a somewhat linear progression in terms of fitting, since they are aside from the minmatar ones. mids and lows of: dreads (from amarr to caldari) - 4/8, 5/7, 5/6 (should be 6/6), 7/5. carriers: 4/7, 5/6, 5/6 (should be 6/5), 7/4. cpu and cap issues arise from inability to fit appropriate modules to compete with other ships of the same class in any respective area. if anything, the nid's bonuses to logistics necessitate a hard, stable tank, since it is essentially useless unless on the front lines."

3/27/2009,"i'll say the same thing i've said a hundred other times. if system scanning tools are developed to the point where local is unnecessary, then i favour the abolition(well, delayed mode-ing) of local. local is a stopgap intel tool, and it wouldn't be used like it is under a sufficiently improved system. that said, given that those scanning tools do not yet exist, trying to extend this to known space is premature. it's fine for the funky space to be genuinely hard to find people in, but not for the real world."

3/27/2009,"the ability to know i am in a system whether i have been seen or scanned, is whats kept me out of 0.0 for the most part. sorry but this is a needed addition, you shouldn't show up on a local cortex unless you choose to say something.use your combat scanners, and kill the localspy."
3/27/2009,"great idea we need more mission farmer alts, and i need some free kills for my cloaking gangs."

3/27/2009,"1) autoupdating scanner ui, maybe a mini-ui might be nice.2) no3) sure"
3/27/2009,"no.why?because in ""normal"" space entry and exit to the system is governed by jump gates, which broadcast the info on a system-wide basis (which is why you can gank someone somewhere, fly to another gate and still be denied permission to jump until your aggro is clear)this information is available to all ships within the sphere of influence of those gates hence jumping into system leads to your appearance in local.w-space is accessed through unstable fractures that are not connected to any technological equipment that will broadcast this information - this is why you only see another player when they open comms by talking, you probe them out, scan them down or get visual contact on the same grid.the only time i would support ships being able to jump into ""regular"" space and not appear in local is covert ops-class ships that enter via covert cynosural field (i.e. if they enter via jump gate they appear in local)"
3/27/2009,"only with suitable scanning substitutes. ccp has made good progress in improving scanning, but it's not ready to replace local yet.that said, i'm going to support this because i want to see what ccp can come up with..."

3/27/2009,this.
3/27/2009,by that logic anyone that enters through a wormhole shouldn't show up either. i still support 100% delayed mode in local in 0.0 it's a lot of fun in w-space picking up a ship on scan that wasn't there before and trying to figure out if it's friend or foe and wondering if they've spotted you. it also seems to benefit/hinder pve'ers and pvp'ers about the same.
3/27/2009,"funny, because when you jump from w-space to k-space you instantly appear on local"
3/27/2009,"the simplest solution would be to make it so that you never show up on the communications channel unless you say something. period.it's a communications tool, not an intel tool. it only became that i suppose out of ccp's negligence. the most logical system, for high-sec, low-sec, 0.0, and wormhole space, is that you never show up on a communication network unless you fraking communicate. any other system is ******ed. does this need to be implemented with boosted ship scanners? yes. but it still needs to be universal. - adding a second support."

3/27/2009,i'm not an awox alt and i support this topic.
3/27/2009,"first, a bit of a preface. according to my source, dss probes were supposed to have a starting strength of 5 instead of 20, and someone goofed. fine. however, i also learned from that same source that when you run a scan with probes, it only returns the four best results for any given result. i confirmed this by using 4, 6, and 8 dss probes around a site that i had scanned down and bookmarked via other means. the results, while consistent with this information, were maddening. at minimum scan range, with 11 strength on the probes after skills, ship, and rigs, the sig's maximum accuracy was slightly less than 25%. it remained at that for all three scenarios. furthermore, i took the painstaking time to arrange the probes in tetrahedral (with 4), octahedral (with 6), and dodecahedral (with 8) configurations, providing the greatest possible quadrangulation. even at 32 au - enough to cover the whole system from each side in four directions - the signatures in the system bounced around like a ping pong ball, so the probes' inherent accuracy has been severely hampered by the 75% drop in strength. i believe i referred to it as a ""nerfbat to the balls.""my main issue is not the strength of the probes (though it was nice while it lasted), but the fact that only 4 results are used. no scientist in their right mind would ever think to just toss out extra data points, however precise they may or may not be, so long as they referred to the same general area or range. when we're talking about probes, each probe knows approximately how far away an object is within a given error. using only 4 results does indeed give you a point result, but if you're able to add more scans from different directions to resolve the error, hypothetically you could eliminate the error almost entirely if you simply quadrangulated from many directions. the result might not be perfect, but it would be fairly accurate, and you could move the probes closer to the result to give a perfect hit.in short, all i request is that every probe that a player can control be able to be used in the determination of a given signature's position, not simply the ""four best."" also, a base strength of 10 wouldn't hurt, since these probes are supposed to be ""highly advanced"" and do require astrometrics 5. however, the first half of the proposal is the most important."
3/27/2009,"argh. clearly, i do support my own topic.yarrsticks."
3/27/2009,it sucks that additional probes beyond 4 does nothing to improve the signal.
3/27/2009,"this whole probing system is designed around stepping everything down by a factor of 2 each time until you hit 100%. deep space probes just let you start 3 steps higher, which is useless in small systems and necessary in large ones. personally, i thought the pre-nerf deep space probes were a great reason to go for astrometrics 5, which i likely won't bother with now, but it does fundamentally make more sense. you shouldn't be able to achieve final scan results with deep space probes, you should need to swap down to something with better resolution. as for your point about the four best, i'll say two things. one, you're clearly in the hard sciences, because the soft sciences seem half the time to be all about throwing out data points to make the world fit the model(i don't mean that badly - you simply cannot analyze broad trends in a field like history or economics without making subjective decisions on what counts as a legitimate data point). secondly, while triangulation is a hard science in the real world, it's a game mechanic in eve. the added probes protect you from deviation and give you significantly better results on the whole, but they want low-skill characters not to be too badly disadvantaged under this system, and so they capped the number of probes that contribute directly. it may not make physical sense(although, to be fair, it may - the data coming from these probes is obviously incredibly loose at higher ranges, which you can see as you watch probes jump around by multiple au between scans, and throwing out data may sometimes be reasonable), but it makes gameplay sense, and that's 95% of what ccp cares about."
3/27/2009,"i think the issue is more profound than the op has it.as noted in this thread in the game development forum deep space probes (dsps) are no better than core probes apart from a greater probe range and they warp faster (and really...the warp faster thing is not a big deal at all). the greater probe range is hardly useful at all as the 32au on the core is plenty most times (simply use more to cover a bigger system if necessary...a trivial task). indeed the core probes are actually better since they can narrow the scan range down more than dsps. at the same range they are the same strength.so, you train a 14(ish) day skill to l5 for what? more expensive probes that take up more room in your cargo hold?to make matters worse apparently the sisters deep space probe is now precisely the same as the normal dsp (or so others have suggested...i have not checked).as probing existed before the nerf it was a hassle to find what you were looking for in a system since the game nicely forgets all your previous results on each new scan. however, the dsps made it somewhat tolerable as they were. now it has become a hell of probing down everything to exceptional accuracy and pinning it and then doing that again and again. boring and tedious barely cover it. timesink understates it. nightmare is closer to the mark.it seemed one of the main issues with dsps as they were was they were very overpowered when finding player ships. no question that needed a nerf. rather than a nerf though, one which would have reasonably made dsps not good at probing for ships but kept their probing of signatures useful, we get this ham-fisted hatchet job.truly, looking at the issues of gutting a l5 skill so it is worthless to train and making the ""better"" probes literally no better than their lesser counterparts and to toss the whole need for an expanded launcher, is nothing short of astonishing. csm please ask ccp for their thoughts on this one soon. at least give the players a sense if this is exactly how ccp envisioned this or if they (what i am hoping) merely gutted the probes as a very short term fix to avoid the ship probing imbalance on those and mean to provide a more balanced version soon (and not trademarked ""soon"" but actual, honest to god ""soon!"")."
3/27/2009,i bolded the part you missed. there's no concord response in 0.0 space.
3/27/2009,"unless empty moons are so hard to find, i'm not sure why people are concerned about it. what is the main reason for a hi sec pos? a research lab? if so why do you have to be close to a market hub to set your pos up at?"
3/27/2009,concord really should not protect off-line pos
3/27/2009,"agreed i would prefer the un-anchoring method myself.i would say 15 days and your tower gets unanchored.maybe a week but no less then that.oh i also like the idea of no concord for offline pos'sso both, your pos goes offline it is considered space junk after 24 hours and someone can take it out.or they can wait for it to unanchor in the 7 to 15 day period and take it all."
3/27/2009,"you seemed to miss the part where she said that she cant shoot their towers without a war, so we're obviously not talking anything ""but"" high sec towers."
3/27/2009,again.... if the tower is offline for 24 hours...no more than 36.it self destructs or becomes steal able.you people who ask for 1 week or more.... your just making the problem worse.the idea is to only hold moons your actively fueling for.. not squatting them like a bunch of jackasses.if you want the moon that bad.. fuel the damn tower.otherwise leave.
3/27/2009,well rl comes into it unfortunately and that is why i say 24 hour and it can be destroyed and then one week and it can be stolen. i really don't like the idea of it just self destructing that is too easy and not eve.that does not create a problem cause if you want the moon that bad then destroy it.if not then wait the time and see if you can steal it and make a profit.
3/27/2009,"how bout if somebody else wants the moon that badly, they kill your tower... as you've obviously invested more time and money into that moon at that point than they have... and working for rewards is what eve is about."
3/27/2009,"rl is a poor excuse.pos's should be employed by people who can use them.... that means a corp.you get a partner to help out.end of discussion.also... read my damn post... i said ""stealable"" as an option as opposed to self destructing.it is perfectly logical and feasible considering the nature of eve.you leave a can out there in space and its open to the world.. what do you expect?it's gonna get tipped.pos's are a a rampant problem... stop making excuses that favor the problem and come up with solutions that are rational.1 week is too long... and that would mean anyone could fuel it for a singular day and wait a week.at least with 24/36 hours..if you snooze.. you lose."
3/27/2009,*grumbles @ stupid eve forums glitch*
3/27/2009,i am not disagreeing with you i am saying both options.24 hours you can destroy it. (you will have to work to get that moon)and 1 week is becomes unanchored and can just be picked up and stolen.do you consider this an unreasonable option for a free 100 million to 1.1 billion isk pos ????
3/27/2009,"the problem with your logic as ive already said... people can exploit that.most won't know that the pos is offline until they start looking around.by allowing it to stay there for 1 week... they can refuel it and bring it back online.and allow them to ""destroy"" it implies a number of problems... does this mean they have to war-dec the corp?just allowing anyone to destroy the pos is not what i call a good idea... its a can of worms at best.does the owner get aggro to fire back??too many holes there...there needs to be a stern mechanic here... either you maintain your pos or it gets turned into space garbage or robbed.you can suggest all you want as far as solutions go... but 1 week is too long imo.few months ago i would agree... but now.... so many people want in on that territory.... its utterly insane today."
3/27/2009,"edited for correctionsagreed, offline poses should, after a certain period of time, become legally fair game for anyone to either shoot at or appropriate. no one should be reserving moons that they can't use.from what i can see, poses near hi-sec are primarily used for moon mining, because that's where the money is. valuable moons shouldn't be beaugarded if they're not being used. unused poses are not uncommon. it can be hard to find unoccupied moons of enough worth to justify fueling them in some areas. and naturally, corps will find it preferable to erect poses as close to civilization, which makes unused poses very frustrating.now, i do think that a corp in this situation is currently well-advised to simply relocate to a less convenient part of space. but it seems silly to me that moons can be reserved in this way, and often forgotten about."
3/27/2009,i would say yes the corp can defend its pos.and you should be able to defend yourself.hmm a can a worms yes but i think maybe it could provide something interesting @ the same time.say corp a lets there pos run out of fuel.corp b comes in and starts taking it out after the 24 hour timer comes in to play.corp a comes in to defend.when corp a fires @ corp b a instant war dec starts for 24 hours.both sides can open up on each other to fight over the moon.the price for letting the pos run out of fuel and the price for wanting the moon right now.concord will not get involved.and if the corp is in a alliance ?personally i would rather keep this on a corporation level as it is a corporation issue not an alliance issue.but i doubt the mechanics would allow it which is a shame cause it should.and yes someone can keep fueling the pos every other day but it still shows intent and would quickly become a pain in the ass to keep it up.and you could always just war dec them and be done with it.in most cases though i think more pos's will just get destroyed without the owner lifting a finger.need to think on this more.but i don't agree with a 24 hour timer and the pos just goes boom or can be stolen.too easy especially cause how this would effect pos's in 0.0cause if you let a pos run out of fuel you have to un-anchor everything else before it can be re-anchored.and you would be surprised how many major alliances in 0.0 and low0sec have issues keeping pos's fueled.
3/27/2009,"too bad there are no mineable moons in high sec or this might have merit. there are absolutely no minerals within moons in high security space, generally the only purpose of a high security pos is running labs for research, invention, and from what i can tell, t3 construction at this point."
3/27/2009,"sorry, you're right - i had confused myself and misspoke. near high-sec is what i mean - the barely-low-sec areas as close as possible to hi-sec. there are enough moons in real hi-sec that crowding isn't a serious problem there, and particular moons aren't more desirable than others since it makes no difference what moon you're orbiting."
3/27/2009,a: your making a simple solution more complicated. 24 hour war-dec is not a good way of resolving this issue.b: this is just high sec... call it a concord policy... much like not being able to anchor secure cans in systems higher than a certain sec level.c: make it 36 hours then... but not a week. 2... 3 days at most.1 week is too long.at least your thinking this through...and for that i respect you. but your compromising the balance in the process.
3/27/2009,"looks like some alliances are having to re-learn empire...but, i also agree, there should be a way to hack/steal highsec towers. however, you could always find an offline small with a one man corp and wardec them with an alt corp running amarr gank bs. it won't take long and will be cheap and easy. you can even turn it into a profitable venture if you can find towers that still have modules at them."
3/27/2009,smoking cigs/weed/crack and drinking should be in eve. it'll definitely make spinning spaceships a lot more fun. especially if there are fun visuals added in with getting high.
3/27/2009,i like keeping records of me getting pawned and podded
3/27/2009,mercenaries. pretty much nuff said.in detail:mercs that can prove they did their job make money. killmail = proof.mercs that cannot prove anything don't. no killmail = no proof.
3/27/2009,"first off people don't have to report kill mails to a public kill board.but they do and that system was around long before the kill mails even existed.so the current system is a convenience to those that wish to report what they kill nothing more.so removing it would serve no purpose other then aggravate those that use the mechanic.and for the rest of us that don't bother with it, we just don't bother to look @ it.so rather then hearing wining about why it was removed from those that use it, and for me cause i would rather have ccp working on actual issues then this i say no leave it as is."
3/27/2009,killmails are a good idea. they tell you your contribution to the fight and who contributed to your demise. otherwise all combat tactics would be totally theoretical with no one actually knowing what worked and what totally failed.the problems that need to be addressed and things that need to be added are.1. logistics contribution to damage taken.2. hitpoints transferd by logistics 15 minutes before rr ship dying.3. a solution to fake mails.neither of which justify the removing of killmails. an act that would create many more problems.
3/27/2009,"this is a serious issue which hasn't been addressed properly although there has been talk about it for god knows how long.the underlying problems are:regular cloaking devices (non-covert ops cloaks) and the mechanics that dictate that a cloaked ship is impossible to scan down. aggro timer when engaging anything. currently we have the 15 minute aggro timer when you engage a player ship and log off but aggroing npc ships is not taken into account, this being a major issue when a person spontaneously logs offspontaneous logoffs when being aggressed by npcs, like mentioned abovethe issue with non-covops cloaking devices has been raised many times already and it has been acknowledged, yet nothing has been made to correct it. at the same time scanning mechanics have been completely revamped, scanning out ships is now more time consuming than ever before while a simple module like a prototype cloaking device can effectively make you invulnerable. effectively what this means is that in a supposedly harsh environment of 0.0 a player can simply warp off and cloak using a non-covops cloak before anything can catch it. a battleship with a prototype cloak can warp off an asteroid belt and cloak (and therefore become invulnerable) before any ship can warp in to the belt and tackle the battleship. i'm fine with being slow and having crappy reactions but when catching a battleship on a belt 1,000,000 km off the gate you're jumping in from with an interceptor is considered impossible there must be something fundamentally wrong.the biggest problem of course is the non-human factor in most of the forementioned cases. the player is using a macro/bot of some kind and therefore can react way before a human on the other side can react. even this i can still accept but the fact that they do this and then use a fundamentally flawed mod like the prototype cloak to become invulnerable is just unacceptable. the other variant that we've seen is that the player simply logs off as soon as another player enters the system and with no proper aggro timer present from shooting npcs the player is impossible to catch, especially after making ship scanning even harder than what it used to be.summarizing the post, scanning has been made more time consuming than before while no aggro/logoff/cloaking mechanics have been altered. this has been unbalanced for a long time and is even more unbalanced now. the biggest problem i see here is the macros and the current mechanics that make these macros possible and profitable to use. this has to change, either by seriously affecting the penalties of fitting a non-covert ops cloak, making the non-covert cloaks finally scannable or by changing the logoff/aggro mechanics. something just has to be done."
3/27/2009,"i hate to sound like a **** here but....isn't it called a ""cloak"" for a reason? the only improvement i can see to your situation is a drastic increase in either the difficulty to produce cloaks of all types - or a drastic increase in training times to use them. i'm also not sure what you were getting at with the log-off mechanics. ships that have logged off can still be scanned down for something like two hours i believe?maybe i'm just wrong, feel free to correct me. or clarify this some more, and i'll support."
3/27/2009,"yes, i just hate paying the corporate tax when i sell my minerals....oh wait..."
3/27/2009,fixed.
3/27/2009,lolfunny funny.
3/27/2009,"do not support.before this issue can ever even have a chance of happening ccp would have to fix a number of other issues:1. the incredibly cheap cost of a war-dec, they are basially free at the moment.2. the corp jumping thing. if people get kicked out of npc corp then they will just join corps that have enough alts with their own corps that they can basically just leave altcorp1 and jump to altcorp2, and when that is decced jump to altcorp3 and so on.neither of these things will be changed/fixed anytime soon and both would have to be addressed before this could ever have a chance of happening.also, i am of the opinion that if you want to be in a npc corp and just play the game highsec worry free fine. the only people that want to dec highsec corps are the ones that have trouble in low/0.0 anyway."
3/27/2009,"yeah. mission farmers. macro miners. they sure need pos, teamwork and large fleets.look how stupid you are, troll."
3/27/2009,"mining doesn't make much isk now anyway, i can assure you most non-alts in npc corps do nothing but run missions all the time."
3/27/2009,"you're...you're not a miner, are you? have you ever even turned on a mining laser? one of my corpmates makes enough from mining in his hulk (largely solo) to pay for his account in plexes with some left over. it may not be ""much isk"" by your definition, but ffs 350+ million a month ain't loose change either."
3/27/2009,"darth vader voice - ""you underestimate the power of the mining laser"""
3/27/2009,noexamplesi am a pirate and have no to be associated with anybody i am privateer and do missions and whatever else to make a living.i am a independent miner and don't wish to be associated with anybody.i am scammer and a pick-pocket (not sure how you would do that but you get the idea)i am spy.etc etc etc.i would love the ability to remove myself from any corporation though.it would be nice to see people with a corporation identifier of none.now that would be better then a npc corp and would show a personal choice.
3/27/2009,"actually, i am- 'bearing in hisec right now, mining veld with a hulk/exp rigs/t2 & crystals etc, and solo a couple hours mining nets me from 6-10 mil. if i mission, i more than double that.but to make enough to buy several plexes? maybe if i didn't buy anything else that month, sure."
3/27/2009,he don't know how to mine does he.....stick to mission running.... leave the minin to the pros... not to mention the knowledge about them.
3/27/2009,"apparently not. assuming ""a couple of hours"" actually means 2 hours, i can make 5-6 million in my retreiver, for goodness sake. with a fully fitted hulk i would expect to make somewhere between 15 - 20 in the same amount of time./me can't fly hulks yet . i've been too busy training for a typhoon."
3/27/2009,"assuming you have a hauler alt going, and are mining regular veldspar, you make a shade under 11.7 million per hulk per hour. that's about half as much as a missioner with a decent amount of skill makes, but it's far easier. alternately, if you fit a hulk up for cargo space, and then mine semi-afk, you make better than 2 million every time you dock up. it's not enough to retire on, but it's a fully respectable income stream. if you're making 3-5 mil an hour mining actively, even solo, you're doing it wrong."
3/27/2009,"no hauler alt, expander rigs... i'll get accurate times and numbers tonight."
3/27/2009,we expect full fitting spec sheet with charges and whatever your mining to be listed pal.if your going to ante up... go all in. or nuthin!
3/27/2009,yessir capt'n o7
3/27/2009,let all npc-corp players get conscripted to their empires militia 3 months after they started
3/27/2009,we expect all pvp'ers to mine for 3 months straight before being allowed to fire a single shot.oh..wait...
3/27/2009,"they can join sooner if they want, but not stay in npc-corp longer then 3 months before getting a concord letter telling them: ""congratulation you are now a member of 'your* empires milita. no go make us proud son!"""
3/27/2009,"this is a pvp game, whelp."
3/27/2009,pvp doesn't necessarily involve combat.
3/27/2009,if its a pvp game then why are there miners and manufacturer's smartass?
3/27/2009,but only if you require all people to mine for 3 months straight.
3/27/2009,"this is a pvp game, whelp. did you already forget, i just told you?"
3/27/2009,so what your saying is... pvp'ers don't know how to read let alone answer direct questions right?wow... i feel sorry for you guys.
3/27/2009,"not supported, because you want players ""forced"" out of npc corps. offer incentives instead to encourage ppl and i'd sing a different tune.possibilities:a. after say 3 months. npc corp start handing out missions to members that gain them nothing but standings gain with that corp. if these missions are failed/refused they gain a standings hit that if not rectified will eventually have them thrown out to a different npc corp. (downside is that it still has elements of being forced)b. start instituting a corp tax on npc corpsc. let members of player corps use corp standings to access hostile agents from other factions as a means of repairing personal standings.d. give bonuses to mining or some such (similar to fleet bonuses but not stacking with them) to members of player corps while in any system they have an office or a pos.i would personally rather see something like c or d as they are incentives and not penalties."
3/27/2009,"you're right. there is only pvp. no missions, no ratting, no mining, no refining, no manufacturing, no invention, no trading, no hauling... right? the only ships that exist are there to kill. like the orca.you're just a jackass. insulting doesn't prove a point. npc corps have good pros and cons. people don't need to be forced into combat when it will probably find them eventually, even if it's only suicide ganking."
3/27/2009,i think we should be able to have a no corporation association option.or if that can't be done how about one called none or independent.something to say hey i do my own thing and have no need to be associated with anybody.examplesi am a pirate and have no to be associated with anybody i am privateer and do missions and whatever else to make a living.i am a independent miner and don't wish to be associated with anybody.i am scammer and a pick-pocket (not sure how you would do that but you get the idea)i am spy.etc etc etc.
3/27/2009,no.npc's already do that let alone 1 man corps.
3/27/2009,yeh yeh yeh i hit return by mistake.the rest of it is in there now
3/27/2009,"yes.especially combined with option to have wardec/vendetta against individual characters. (no matter npc corp, player corp or no corp)"
3/27/2009,"i agree with this actually, i think a non-affiliation (rogue capsuleers as it were) would be a neat thing to have."
3/27/2009,"no, this is game is designed with corporations in mind. no support.--isaac"
3/27/2009,oh for crying out loud.do i have to spell it out for you low iq people?non affiliated pilots are worse than npc.its nigh perfect immunity!it will never happen... hell will freeze over before you get that far.
3/27/2009,"only if you can war-dec an unaffiliated person. but if you can war-dec an unaffiliated person for less money than a corp, everyone would, and no one would choose to be unaffiliated as opposed to be in an npc corp.if all you want to do is not belong to someone else's corp, just found your own. like, the duke of plaza-toro, ltd.if you were proposing replacing the npc corps with ""unaffiliated"" status such that individuals could be war-dec'ed, that'd be something else.in its proposed incarnation, though, this seems impractical to me."
3/27/2009,semi-this.1 man corp is far better anyway.npc corps are especially nice for new pilots who join up in there first days.... they get a corp chat for the npc corp and can ask questions related to there race so to speak.. its likely to be a bit quieter than rookie chat.that's just one advantage... npc's are typically non-affiliated anyway!so i fail to see the reason for this proposal to begin with.. even if you allow war-dec to singular individuals... then whats the point... might as well allow that across the game itself.this is a ridiculous proposal...and a can of worms at best.
3/27/2009,"fair enough, it's rare, but the other three still apply quite frequently."
3/27/2009,"i thought that too at first. however, it has nothing to do with orbiting. it works, no matter whether the enemy orbits or not. it just requires you to make tactical maneuvers, too. if you do so, you can take advantage of it.there is an old naval tactic called ""crossing the t"". the basic setup looks like this:< < < < < ^ ^ ^ ^ ^the triangles are the ships in their direction of movement. it means the one who crosses can fire broadsides at his enemy wave after wave, while the enemy can only use it's forward batteries and has to shoot a moving target with maximum transversal. in eve, only the transversal speed remains of that. still, if you cross the t of your opponents flight vector and you have his inertia beaten down, he can't adjust his vector well. so eventually you end up orbiting him and you can dictate range not by speed, but by vector, because he either stops to align to you, losing distance and speed, or he takes forever doing so on the fly, falling behind on your actual vector.it is complicated, but it should work at least in theory. of course caldari pilots would have to learn that ships can actually move during combat, first."
3/27/2009,"problem is, eve isn't a tactical movement game - the commands are simplistic and not designed to let you do what you're trying to do here. really, the only commands you can enter are to dictate range - there's ""move to x"", ""orbit at x"", and really that's about it. furthermore, there's a deep problem with how tracking is implemented, in that it doesn't account for the rotation of the firing ship - if you're in a circular orbit of a stationary point, the effective tracking is zero, not (radial) like eve uses. if they implemented that then you'd have a lot more tactics in how ships move, but at present it's solely about dictating range. the inertia gun makes it a bit easier to do that, but it seems like it'd be far less effective than a web. maybe if you made it outright add an amount of mass then it'd be better for anti-frigate work, but then it's useless against big ships. i see what you're saying, and i agree to some extent, but offhand i don't think eve is the game you're looking for here."
3/27/2009,"thing is hersch.... eve would be soooo much better if it was a tactical game.it's just too plain and jane to show up and open fire on a ship.it would be so much better if ships had there weak points and strong points depending on the shape and position.for example... a malestrom has all of its cannons along the side of the ship on the starboard and port sides.one would think that going ""broadside"" on a ship of that magnitude would be a very...risky venture if not fatal...as all guns are brought to bear.if the malestrom was firing her cannons in the front or the rear quadrants.... it wouldn't be as effective.... yet it is to a degree.eve would be more interesting that way.... opening up on a ships rear quandrent to knock out the engines...blind spots...etc..etc...but..alas..not likely to happen.i can dream can't i? : o )"
3/27/2009,"i got some positive feedback on this topic in the ideas forum and am submitting this for an official vote.((topic 1))i understand the need to restrict tractor beams in high sec space, but i think the game shouldn't restrict you from pulling other people's wrecks in null sec or at the very least extend the tractor beam to work on alliance wrecks. this arbitrary limitation about wreck ownership makes cleaning up around alliance systems a pain in the ass for all salvagers, especially when the owners are offline and cant fleet you.(note)this proposal is specifically for low and null sec systems 4  0.0. systems of sec status 5 and up should and probably will remain as they are. ((topic 2))someone also suggested allowing tractor beams to pull unanchored structures and containers so i am adding it on the main proposal as topic 2"
3/27/2009,i support this topic.
3/27/2009,you support this.... thats funny because it doesnt look like you are support this eh?;-p
3/27/2009,"definitely supported for 0.0, assuming it's technically feasible. probably supported for lowsec as well."
3/27/2009,i understand some limitations for this in high-sec maybe even low-sec but 0.0 should be free for all.
3/27/2009,supported
3/27/2009,"oh man, we need this"
3/27/2009,supported for obvious reasons.
3/27/2009,"sure, why not. an exportable block log file could prove useful for some users."
3/27/2009,a good idea
3/27/2009,"actually i think that could lead to alot more problems in imblancing than is already ingamea rig that provides for a fitting slot?why cant i have a rig for a propulsion slot, or more drones, or 1 for a web.... at what point is it no longer a rig slot but just an omnislot?nice idea but not really wanted"
3/27/2009,training it to 5 should allow the directional scanner to sort things properly.

3/27/2009,"as a ""very knowledgeable"" player what is your opinion of fitting interdictors without bubble launchers, and the loss of said interdictors to solo frigates? what actions would you take against vocal critics of such fittings?"
3/27/2009,"lol still feeling bitter about having your access to our forms removed vit? oh well. in any case i personally wouldn't use an interdictor in that way but mostly because i think there is a number of ships that can do the job just as well. having said that i can see that a high speed dessie would be useful in some situations outside of 0.0 and certainly wouldn't post insulting and snippy comments/pictures about someone who did want to try it. as for actions of censorship taken against people who critise such fittings i would be taking no actions as constructive criticism is a key way of helping others. continual pointless smack and insulting of other members of a forum is another matter entirely of course and, after consultation with other moderators of said forums, i would be only too happy to remove that persons posting/reading rights if there was enough continued complaints against said person. hope that helps."
3/27/2009,i personally love to fit interdictors without bubble launchers. i use the extra slot to fit minibars and jacuzzi and consider that since my clone's cost 30mil isk anyways its a bit pointless to fly a tech1 destroyer when tech2 versions are available
3/27/2009,where do you stand on the whole bob reloaded kerkuffle?what do you think about mining income versus missioning?what do you think about militia members getting faction hits for rring fellow militia members who have criminal security status?
3/27/2009,"well to be honest i find the amount of forum talk about it to be far in excess of what the subject deserves. as it is i think that the changing of the name from kenzuko to band of brothers re-loaded was a mistake on someones part within ccp. i doubt there was anything malicious in doing so simply on the basis that it really doesn't mean all that much at the end of the day. as mentioned by several people on both the giant threads in regard to the topic if the ex-bob leadership had formed an entirely new alliance and then petitioned the ""band of brothers"" corp for name squatting i can see how that would have been a viable solution to the affair. as it is rolling back the decision was the right move in my opinion. not becuase of the public outcry over the issue one way or another but simply because kenzuko had been in existence for too long to say something like ""whoops our bad we meant to type something else"".as a csm i would, as stated above, be more than willing to ask ccp if an investigation had been carried out into how this whole mess had happened. the issues with mining income versus missioning to me seems to be three major areas. firstly the isk a miner makes is entirely determined by the market (since the removal of shuttles as an npc item removed the lower limit cap for trit) and as such fluctuates with supply and demand whilst missioning is a relativity fixed income which only relies on the time you put in. the second issue is that of macro-mining which connects to the supply and demand part as the market value of minerals is artificially reduced by the abundance of minerals ""created"" by these miners. lastly the reprocessing of mission loot seems to me to put in an inordinate amount of minerals into the market which further devalues the mineral prices. i personally would like to see more dynamism in mission running in regards to the rewards you get and the quality of the agent being heavily linked to the number of requests that agent has for missions per day. i would also like to see the loot drops reduced and maybe balanced by a small increase in the bounties of the rats in the missions. of course this would be a delicate balance to achieve and would need some work by ccp as well as other options looked at that the players suggest. i'm sure this will get some backs up but i agree with it. the various factions are in effect subservient to the ded in regards to standings in many ways. they all ""respect"" the negative standing placed on someone by the ded and as a result helping such a person would result in a lowering of standings towards the faction. now i can understand this makes things tough for those militias who have such people in their midst but at the end of the day you still have the choice not to work with them. i think it would be far more sensible and fit in with the way the standings system is supposed to work if people with a criminal security status weren't allowed to join. however this would be ignoring the long standing traditions of privateering. i suppose there could be some sort of letter of marque given to a criminal but that's a whole different kettle of fish and would have to be looked at very carefully in order to not allow factional warfare to turn into a pirate free for all. i don't have anything against pirates though i work with a number of them all the time but eve is about choices you make. if you chose to be a pirate then ""official"" bodies such as the four core empires won't like you and if you chose aid one then you are aiding a criminal above the status of aiding a fellow militia member based on the idea that ded standings are more important than empire standings."
3/27/2009,"who am iyou are voting for a real life person to represent you :hendrik scheiderbusiness process analyst34 years old, from berlin, europeje parle fran<U+FFFD>ais ! toutes vos id<U+FFFD>es, soumettez-les <U+FFFD> moi en fran<U+FFFD>ais.mein wahlprogramm auf deutsch, siehe eve-online.decontact me in-game or via my siteplaystyle being ceo of a small industrial corporation, i am working at eve's economical foundation. i do not suffer from the ivory tower syndrome that other candidates might have, instead i am well aware of the issues that affect most of you every day. having graduated from caille university in 2003, i am seasoned in many different fields in eve : from production, mining, and trading to exploration and combat, to working with the api and operating eve-related websites. continue reading to learn about what my team achieved, what we envision, and how you can be part of that ! two prior terms on the csm as representative of take care, i'll take over from council member ankhesentapemkah, who has already served two terms on the council of stellar management. her experience is of great value and will ensure high standards with regards to dealing with ccp as well as listening to you and other players. that means, if you vote for me, i will start at full speed. there will not be any delay in representing you within csm and towards ccp due to learning and getting acquainted. further more, take care is not affiliated with any of the major powerblocks and is the voice for invididualists and small corporations, and strives to improve eve for all playstyles. where we are lacking experience, those topics are filled by my advisors from take care and the allies who my company has. we are maintaining an informal network of hundrets of capsuleers, allowing us to quickly gain reliable and hands-on intel on any given subject, which you bring to my attention. a new flavour of course, i enter the ring with my own way of thinking and personal preferences : social networking. looking ahead, i want to bring your thoughts to ccp's attention on how cosmos (aka eve facebook) and ambulation (aka walking-in-stations) can improve your abilities to brag about achievements, communicate with your friends, interact with your enemies. the sandbox approach of eve needs more thrust : your actions should be important. epic mission arcs should offer real choices and have a backstory impact. programmable npcs should be introduced and facilitate player-created missions, providing more roleplay opportunities. and, finally, no half-ready content should be pushed into the game, where it never gets finished. achievements take care has managed to live up to all it's election promises in the past. ankhesentapemkah's repeated raising of the skill queue issue resulted in the implementation of a queue in the recent apocrypha expansion. suicide ganking was made more balanced, without completely removing the practice. battleship-sized rats were added to low-security, and 0.0 game mechanics will be the major focus for eve's next expansion. many smaller issues have been brought to ccps attention and will be worked on in the future, such as factional warfare and the problems and repetition related to mining and missions."
3/27/2009,"transparancy most importantly, thanks to ankhesentapemkah, you now have a wiki where you can keep track of all csm issues. and ccp is looking for further means to improve communication with the players. i will continue this path towards transparancy and accountability, after all, what good is the csm if the players cannot clearly see what is being worked on ? this is no vague talk or idle promise, as can be proven by take care's track record over the past year. participation i encourage all players to participate at take care and get involved with the csm. there may be issues that are important for you, and we would love to hear from you. you can send questions, concerns and comments to ankhesentapemkah and me, and we'll get back to you with an answer.my agenda in a nutshellfind in the following the issues, which are my personal agenda, if you want. changes, which i will try to push forward, if elected csm delegate. some areas i would like to see developed, while not being an expert myself. i can assume that a csm colleague will know a lot more in such areas, and i will constructively support him or her in the submission process. finally, feel free to bring your own topics to my attention or to modify priorities according to your understanding._ programmable npcsprogrammable npcs shall give out your missions to other players. creating missions should allow you to assess the best pilot for later recruitment, build a renommee for yourself in the sector, create an income for mission runners and yourself. the toolset would range from simple courier missions to transport a pile of stuff from a to b (sourced in slices from your own stock), to acquisition (mining / trade / exploration, e.g. nailing down a signature), to killing, where either spawns would be triggered by the type of enemy the mission creator selects, or capsuleers need to be eliminated (where a mission would only be given out, when enemy capsuleers are present, of course)._ concord refactoring""captain, we just received a distress signal in this constellation !"" having a computer generated police force was a logical decision at eve's stage of 40k subscribers. today, with 40k pilots simultaneously online, we have better options, be it by tradeable kill-rights or introducing the role of marshals, who may react on aggression or distress signals.if capsuleers do the job, pirates will have equal opponents : carebears with teeth. and imagine an adaptive system security rating, depending on the number of marshals around, and how that could reshape the galaxy... we could test-drive the mechanics in low-sec first to provide incentives for players to police space and take care of the justice aspect of the game, while providing pirates there with more juicy targets._ 0.0 incentivizingalready mentioned during csm2, but i want to emphesize that endless pos warfare is not the endgame we want. allow 0.0 alliances to do empirebuilding, let them add npcs to their outposts, and provide more reliable money-making activities for the grunts to make isk on site. having reasons for alliances to operate under an nrds policy and making money off visiting carebears would be a bonus, for example by using the player mission system (see above). let 0.0 space be used and come to life - more ships there will then trigger or allow other activities. my focus is an increased interaction between players, making pilots travel more regions of space. of course, 0.0 needs other aspects to be looked at, like the sovereignty mechanics themselves and moon mining."
3/27/2009,"_ finishing factional warfarethere are mechanical flaws, which need to be addressed, from known exploits to stupid spawning. in addition to these engineering issues, i see a much greater importance of factional warfare for the whole galaxy. when war broke lose between the empires, i hoped that it would bring a sort of endgame to high-sec. imagine : conquering a system will make it harder for the inhabitants loyal to the defeated faction to live in it. also, i do not see a reason why amarr can ally with caldari, but a capsuleer alliance cannot. oh, and did i say that i hate spawning ? let plex appearance be player-driven, not totally random ! i can imagine player-owned habitats as factors in occupancy. with solid profits attached until being conquered or destroyed by the enemy. some kind of sovereignty in empire space._ leveraging the standing systemnow this last one is quite abstract, and maybe it is too far-fetched, but let's see : all the greater aspects of eve work side-by-side, connected more or less through the item market. yes, it is hyper-capitalism, and nothing wrong with that. but the ubiquitous call for more backstory involvement, sandbox, and incentives leads me to believe that we need more than isk to compete with. before we had the alliance system, corporations already forged alliances outside of the client.today still, a quarter of a million capsuleers meet eye to eye. you sell to one other, your contract is picked up by one other, you shoot at one other, and if you shoot well, he use his kill-right to shoot back. what you are doing inflicts a change only to exactly one other pilot (or none, when you shoot the environment). and once it is done, it is over. it not really multiplies, stages, nor has indirect effects.my goal is to add interaction between capsuleers and to make it little predictable by introducing a new abstraction layer, on which capsuleers compete throughout new eden, a second market. your standing should empower or hinder you. standing, which others set towards you ! for example from all pilots loyal to the occupying faction. thus, your actions will have a potential backlash upon you both good and bad. standing you currently gain through npc missions and you only use it for missions. standing given by other pilots is irrelevant. standing given by a corporation to a pilot is irrelevant. but in future, standing may allow the marshal role for the occupying faction or sovereign alliance. it might give real bonusses to your personal profit and efficiency of your corp. the standing settings of each pilot towards you will gain importance, to an extent as they are themselves liked or disliked, depending on the region of space you are in (occupancy). the resulting standing network will be hard to exploit, as we deal with thousands of individuals. and ten alts will not make a difference.the cushion, from where the ball bounces back to you can then be...- occupancy, where the loss of a system affects the whole loyal community there- aggression and kill-rights, which may be used by other capsuleers than the involved two parties- your creativity, where your missions in good standing are required for an infrastructure which you may exploit._ further issuesthe above list is not complete. as said earlier, i cannot adopt issues, where i am not an expert in the area of effect. a lot of ship and module effects fall under this category. personally, i think, there is something wrong with the turret mechanics in close-up battle. i will support such submissions, the least i can do is checking arguments for validity and completeness.my focus is networking and increasing travel and trade and interaction. that is the view i want to add to the csm discussion."
3/27/2009,"i express my confidence in erik, he'll make a great csm and continue the work i've been doing the past year."
3/27/2009,"anyone can stand on a soapbox in the street and trumpet their desire to make life better for everyone, to cure what ails us, to produce win/wins, and to otherwise make happiness fall from the sky like rain. this isn't limited to the csm either - we're pikers compared to rl politicians. thing is, even if they do mean what they say, they can't generally deliver. yes, it's possible to have everyone gain from a change, but a lot more frequently, someone gains and someone else loses. the gains can outweigh the losses, but you can't carry on blithely unaware that there are people who will suffer a loss because of the change you propose. this is why it's fundamentally false to claim that you're trying to let everyone play the game they want, because when the platitudes end and the policies begin, you're not. you can't. you can't even increase the isolationism offered to players without affecting other people, because you're withdrawing the new isolationists from interactions they would otherwise have engaged in, and that would otherwise have benefited others. you say i'm being too specific, but i'm just pulling out one example of many. there is no issue where you can propose a change that does not harm somebody, and you cannot call those changes simple isolationism with a straight face. bears have simple tastes much of the time, but their desires will inevitably come into conflict with the desires of others. as for the overarching issue, i think we agree. i'm entirely for players organizing to have their voices heard, and this seems like a decent vehicle for doing so. i'm not trying to derail issler's attempt here, i'm just trying to make sure that everyone understands what it will actually look like at the end. you can't get what you want without stepping on the toes of others, at least to some extent, so be aware of that going in. if this party is to succeed, it needs a clear agenda and a clear understanding of how it will enact that agenda and what obstacles it will face along the way. you will never get unanimous support for anything non-trivial, and you will not be able to enact that agenda without serious opposition. understand that, prepare for it, and while you may choose to use pithy slogans in your communications with the outside world, never make the mistake of using them inside your own head. you are not making the game better for everyone, you are not meekly asking to be left alone in a way that doesn't affect anyone else, and you are not making it so that everyone can play the game they want. you are advancing an agenda that you believe will help the game as a whole(or, if you're a jerk, that you believe will help you personally), but there will be casualties along the way, and they will fight you. that's not to say you shouldn't try - on the contrary, i fully encourage you to do so - but please, go into this with your eyes open. too many negatives in that sentence for me to be really unambiguous, so i'll just state this cleanly. everyone has a right to advocate for themselves, their play styles, and their preferred gameplay changes to the best of their ability. i may dispute your points, i may disagree with your goals, but i will never dispute your right to fight for them as best you can. to the best of my recollection, the only people i've ever attacked for speaking on these boards were obvious trolls - hell, i tend to give likely trolls the benefit of the doubt. this isn't about whether issler's crowd can speak up, it's about what it would wind up looking like when they do."
3/27/2009,"do mission runners make enough isk? it's arguable. on the one hand, you have the average level 4 runner who makes shedloads, but on the other hand you have the l3/2/1 runners that make virtually nothing in comparison. i'd say hitting the people who run these lower leveled missions would be unfair. perhaps a good solution would be to remove t1 loot from missions, but replace it with higher quality salvage. this would increase the price of t1 fits at the cost of lowering the price of salvage. higher t1 prices would probably equal higher mineral prices too - you'd get a healthy multiplier. on the other hand, what about the newbie mission runner? if t1 prices increase too much, the risk occurs that he is priced out too easily. the idea of a liberal party is a pipe dream for myself personally, so let me not repeat the assertion. maybe when i can go for a csm position? in my experiance, carebears do not stay carebears forever - they'll eventually branch out into industry, mining or pvp - it's just that some people do this quicker than others!"
3/27/2009,"isn't this the other way around? a liberal party would work towards social engineering and protecting carebears, a conservative party would be based on having as little intervention as possible. or is it just in the us that liberal groups work to protect everyone from themselves and conservative groups want the government to get its nose out of everyone's business."
3/28/2009,agree with op.
3/28/2009,"completely agree with the op! we need our blazing flashes of light on the battlefield. it just completely takes away from the feel of a hotdrop, or any capital event for that matter, without a spectacular flash announcing our arrival"
3/28/2009,/signed
3/28/2009,ummm...eve-files and eve-search to name a few?
3/28/2009,"hmm lets see...why shouldn't he have his obsession fulfilled? because its against the rules? *rolleyes* yeah as if anyone in here plays by the rules all the time. [ofc depending on the rules, i dont think everybody here uses exploits or so ^^] he asks nicely at least"
3/28/2009,"you guys realize with the current rules for highsec capitals, if ccp were to make an exception for them (and we all know how eve hates ccp playing favorites) and move the titan to highsec, he would either be forced to jump it out, or never be able to log in, with a single war dec?you can't dock titans, and amarr can't have control towers (let alone capital ship arrays) anchored. being in space in a capital will mean you get it moved to lowsec. i know chribba's not serious about the request in any way, but i have a feeling some people think this could actually happen."
3/28/2009,that's why it should at least be brought in as a monument.
3/28/2009,highlighted important stuff.....
3/28/2009,pretty much.you should see my minmatar and gallente standings
3/28/2009,"the nag defiantly needs buffed, not sure if i agree with your ""solution"", but something does need to be done. the nid on the the other hand is a great carrier and even if cpu or base hit points/base cap need tweaking, i again don't like your ""solution."""
3/28/2009,"worst dread ever build; make it 4/5/7, change his bonus to rof&dmg/lvl, and you will have a nice dread, like other races; and btw do you know that a tempest have a smaller range than a domi???!"
3/28/2009,"the numbers are in - with all skills at level 5, the naglfar spits out more damage than any other dreadnought right now as it stands. with artillery and torps, it packs about 345 dps pre-siege, the next best being the revelation at about 340 dps. with autocannons, it packs about 435 dps vs the moros' 425 dps. (assumes all level 5s and emp/multispec/antimatter)the downside is that it does indeed more skills than any dread and has the worst tank of any dread. hence, my recommendation that all it needs is an extra mid, more cpu, and better cap. but, that is my opinion, and it's a modest change as it doesn't screw over people that are already skilled for the naglfar (i.e. myself). the improved cpu and cap allows for damage mods to be fitted in the lows without losing a permatank and without having to use serious faction gear, too (outside of siege - permatanking in siege is nigh impossible. doable, but you kill resists doing it unless you have carrier/logistics energy support).if it was made to 3 turret slots with 5%/lvl damage, at level 5, the nag would then do 480 dps with autocannons. but only 310 dps with artillery. just throwing that out there.but yes, i still agree principally with the base argument - minmatar capitals should all be shield tanked at the very least with comparable ease. i personally think that the extra training for both capital artillery and citadel torps is an adequate tradeoff for the best dread damage in the game if only it could tank as easily as the other dreads."
3/28/2009,"that, my friend, is a good point that i had not previously considered. by my own logic i'd have no choice but to support the notion that ships entering regular space from w-space through a wormhole would not appear in local until a w-space-like condition had been met - if someone made a specific thread about that, i'd give it a thumbs up."
3/28/2009,the entire reason you don't show up in w-space is because it lacks communication devices that are in known space and cause you to show up instantly.
3/28/2009,"support.with a caveat that directional scanner needs a severe rework (including autoupdate, just like the overview), and the ability to slave it to station sensors while docked for grid info."
3/28/2009,"of all the players in this game, the china/macro farmers are the least likely to be bothered by endless, monotonous, constant directional scanner clicking for intel.and for us legitimate players? well we hate your poorly thought out idea."
3/28/2009,"i already said there won't be the need for constant scanner clicking.and even with real time scanner update, it's already a big step plus to being able to gank them"
3/28/2009,"this would be a huge boost to small scale pvp. no more of the silly ""hey local is +2. ok, let's undock 50 people!"""
3/28/2009,that would help in my eyes the whole problem of isk farmers in 0.0 its already annoying enough to fly through your space to see macro ratters everywhere. add delayed local and bring some risk to those macro's. i approve just for the plain fact that i want to pop more macro ratting ravens/nighthawks ;)
3/28/2009,"why you people never search for a previous version of the same thread?it was stated by the developers that a auto updating scanner is not a acceptable solution as 50k scanners updating every 2-3 second across all of eve (with all the information gathering that they will do) will add a unacceptable strain to the server, with consequent lag, crashes and so on. from this point on it is my opinion, not some dev statement.local is the system intelligence toll that has the least impact on the game performance. it was possible to remove it from wh space as most of the time a wh system will have a limited number of people in it, so even if they are all using the directional scanner the impact on performance is manageable. it you have 2 20 man fleets in a k space system with every one of them hitting the directional scan every 2 seconds and getting several hundreds of signals the lag will be unberable."
3/28/2009,"i've spent a decent amount of time through the years in both 0.0 and empire, and i definately support this. i do believe there should be some sort of intelligence networking built into the game though. seems strange that in rl now, we can share intel across multiple fleets, but in the future, this is resolved to text or voice comms. i also believe that nerfing down the local-intel would lead to a more specialized intel gathering network, and ultimately shrink empire sizes. all of this, i believe to be a good thing.i detailed a bit of my idea for an ""intelligence network"" here, though some of it is outdated with the newer scanning systems. i guess i should write up a new proposal."
3/28/2009,"i tentatively support this idea, however i agree with a need buff to scanning tools. so for the moment it does not get thumbs up.one idea that may contribute is to tie this in with system scanners on a pos. the current system scanner is essentially redundant since in home systems there will be many ships in space, many of those idling in a pos. perhaps changing the system scanner to show local in a system to the sov holders and their allies would help with this. rational would be the scanner automatically scans and updates local with all the pilots in space.this would retain the intel aspect for the home defence, who reasonably ought to have an advantage where is concerned.however simply changing this would introduce a significant imbalance to the setriment of a hostile roam. therefore buffing scanning tools would be required as well. perhaps a ""transponder probe"" could be introduced, the mechanic being that when deployed it searches for active pilots transponders in the system as a whole. this probe would not be a locator as combat probes currently are, but while deployed by a fleet member would allow visibility of local to a hostile fleet.two seperate mechanics that need to be balanced well. and ultimately allowing visibility of local to both. where the benefit to pvp is concerned it removes local from systems without any sov, unless the parties involved use a ""transponder probe"".active scouting would be more essential, and probers more common in fleets.just a couple of ideas, and maybe not the best, but something to throw into the pot.zos"
3/28/2009,"a simple scenario to demonstrate why this should not be proceeded with.you have a mining op going on in an ice belt with 10 people, an orca and a rorqual. you have scouts out and all is well. you think you are safe and that you have prepared well, but all of a sudden, 20 covert ops (force recons, black ops etc ) appear from nowhere and you start screaming as your well planned and executed little op gets torn to pieces.much puiblic ridicule is heaped on your shoulders by whoever.podded and annoyed at being bounced, you scream at the scouts, ""where was my warning?"" and they yell back, ""we saw nothing.""then it dawns on you. logonski by one character; covert cyno and you were stuffed. and despite all your preparations, you really stood no chance what so ever.small problem perhaps anyone?until an instant scanning system is implemented that warns of hostiles in system and does not drive people to distraction, proceed no further."
3/28/2009,i do support this for reasons allready stated in this thread if ccp improves and adds more scanning mechanics of course.
3/28/2009,"refer to my post above and it is possible to see how some changes could balance this out. arguably it would be foolish to carry out mining ops in a system with no towers, with a tower and sov you would gain a warning from local as you currently do.zos"
3/28/2009,"i agree with this, local needs to be changed. either to have it show blank unless someone has typed. or a 30 second delay at least."
3/28/2009,yeah
3/28/2009,"this is why you need ships in your op to protect your mining ships.it would mean you need to be more on your toes. instead of having a scout 2 jumps down the pipe to give you warning. it makes the game somewhat more exciting then sitting there watching your mining lasers mindlessly and without any worry.its 0.0 space, it only makes sence. local should be removed from game completeley"
3/28/2009,supported - except we should have delayed local in all space.
3/28/2009,sounds like a plan.
3/28/2009,"with the proviso of some much improved scanning interface, oh god yes please do this as soon as you can.at the very least to 0.0"
3/28/2009,"you need to read that again more carefully. what the devs said is that the 'current' directional scanner on autorepeat is bad for the server. this statement was in answer to a ""just put an autorepeat on the directional scanner"" suggestion.obviously the number of possible results/parameters the on-board scanner produces in auto mode would need to be reduced, among other changes.edit: this is what was said -"
3/28/2009,"more importantly , we're not proposing an auto-repeating scanner. only a buff to combat scanning, and or probes.a wise man once said, you want to find someone...use your eyes."
3/28/2009,"i'm not sure i'm understanding you correctly here, but with a delayed local every ship needs to have the innate ability to acquire this intel (in circumstances mainly limited by range) without having to deploy anything, fit any additional modules, or spam button presses. this ability should come from the on-board scanner.deployed and fitted equipment should only serve to enhance that ability."
3/28/2009,"which is why i said we also need a boost to onboard scanners, and combat scanning probes.the two go hand in hand. boost scanners and probes + nerf localspy."
3/28/2009,"the problem with that is the extreme boredom of sitting watching nothing to ""scout"" for hours. its the most ******ed gameplay ever. simply speaking in such a situation attackers have all the advantages, and no drawbacks. attackers dont have to wait. and lets not get started on cloaks that would be extremely overpowered in such a place. all you do is force the few that actually live in 0.0 to get a iskmaking alt in empire along with the rest of you. it would be fun to run around in my recons in 0.0 but no way am i gonna do any ratting or mining in such a scenario. then i'll stick to missions.the only way removing local would make sense is if there is some sort of replacement tool for local that would give some of the same info."
3/28/2009,"heres an idea, because i've been thinking on this for awhile. if we were to come up with some science skills relating to communications networks and interfacing, that would stand as a nice compromise.it would be some extra lvl v's to train, but the idea is only the people with the right training can manipulate the comm-networks to use them for intel. eh? the bonuses could also extend to anyone they are commanding in a fleet. this would allow small 0.0 corps to have one hacker-scout to watch local while he plays, he keeps the gate campers and sentinels informed?just throwing it out there."
3/28/2009,very intriguing.i'd like to see someone expand on this.reading the back stories on fluid comm's always begged the question...wheres the comm hackers?
3/28/2009,"yeah i'm thinking that with two lvl vs, (edit: two lvl v's not counting the pre-reqs)maybe a maximum of 50 names can be displayed on local, even if they don't speak.this + a boost in strength to combat scanning (even if it's only nominal) would be very nice.i had some other ideas about actually hacking comm-channels, but i don't think ccp would ever implement them, even if the skill requirements were insane."
3/28/2009,"imo any skill-based solution will just mean an additional required timesink. everyone will train the new skills and we'll be back to the current situation.i believe the solution to cloaked ships is to add a 'cloak signature' to scan results. no range or direction, just a presence in system. maybe the 'visibility' of this signature should depend on the size and type of the cloaked ship, and its range from the scanning ship or probe."
3/28/2009,"well...no. because if you lower the bonus enough, to say 10 non-speaking people shown on local, and you make the pre-requisites hard enough, then even if everyone trained up, it would still be harder to see who was where.while the idea of cloaked sigs is novel, it would have to be impossible to pin down any of the signals - or cloaking would be pointless. i still think there is probably a skill-based and or modular solution."
3/28/2009,how about only having no local in conquerable space?
3/28/2009,yes please!
3/28/2009,"how will those 10 be chosen? seems a little arbitrary. and how hard would you make the pre-requisites? do the high pre-requisites stop people from having capship-pilot alts? this will just become another item for the alt market.in any case, even just 10 showing up will completely negate the delayed local effect, as a ratter will still safe-and-log when someone shows up in local, and a scout will show up in local to another scout or fleet, etc. everyone will either have trained those skills themselves or have a ""local alt"", in the same way as the current falcon alt. maybe the 'cloak sig' would show up at some relatively short range without giving up the direction, and that this range would vary with the ship size and type. this way makes the stand-off cloaked recon possible, but makes close approach risky."
3/28/2009,"this is what was proposed:""real time scanner updates"" if that is not a scanner on auto repeat it is a scanner in constant use. or it will not be real time. there is nothing obvious in this. so you want to reduce the information you get from the scanner and remove local at the same time.some other nice idea?"
3/28/2009,"simple, scanning sends out a ping. you can passively scan, say 3au, and actively scan the 14 or whatever.so when you scan, you can also be pinpointed.problem solved.so those covops exposed themselves scanning down your position."
3/28/2009,not supported
3/28/2009,i wrote about reducing the amount of info from ship's scanner when in auto-mode. this seemed obvious to me to allow it to work in real time over ranges of several au and not overwhelmingly stress the server. the manual scan may retain all it's current functionality.good idea. adds some complexity to the scanning system.
3/28/2009,"for those who dont know i recently lost a kronos, worth roughly 5 billion isk in mods etc. its my choice to fly it and i really enjoyed flying it.after the patch before everyone knew about the hp bug and the server seemed suprisingly stable i decided to take it for a spin as i had done many a time pre-patch. i jumped into a reasonably sized gate camp but nothing i wouldnt be able to tank. as i decloaked none of my modules appeared to activate, i was then instantly put down to 10% armor, at this point i didnt know what was going on so i hit fraps to rewatch afterwards, i managed to fraps for about half a second before my ship popped, and although the graphics showed my mods inactive a armor repair cycle went through boosting me to about 70% armor a second volley popped me instantly. the fraps shows clearly that just 2 zealots were actually firing, the larger ships didnt even have time enough to lock me.this kronos has 80-84% resistances on everything and i thought i had been doomsdayed at first, i quickly posted the mail and apparently 2 zealots were the only thing doing damage to me. my kronos with 7k shield 9k armor with 80+% resistances and my structure 10k with damage control had been melted by 2.9k damage from 2 zealots only (2 volleys for them)luckily for the guys who popped me the best stuff lived including 2x centum a-type lar's and vizan's eanm. i petitioned and quickly received my ship back but of course minus the mods that lived.this policy has been in place a long time and i've never challenged it because quite frankly its never been worth the effort but i'll be damned if i wanst gonna try and challenge it here.anyway to cut a very long story short after 2 weeks of escalating petitions i was given the finger. this policy is ridiculous, isk is something that takes time to make in eve and somehow ccp think its reasonable that a victim of a bug they admitted was their fault should lose 3+bil isk because what, they dont want to take mods off people who should never have gained them in the first place. if ccp make a mistake ccp should fix the mistake, i know if i make a mistake in eve i have to pay for it.i have to live with the fact i suffered a massive loss to ccp, but in the future i want to see people getting anything they lost back because we're all paying customers and why should we take a hit because ccp f*cked up.i understand that perhaps it would be very difficult and time consuming to retrace those modules steps but at the very least the person who lost the ship due to a blatant bug should get the market price for that module(s) placed back into their wallets. i dont think there are enough legitimate losses to seriously affect the economics of eve by doing this, but regardless i think something should change."

3/28/2009,signedhow do i get that tumsup thingy?
3/28/2009,i s'port this.
3/28/2009,"i'm sorry, but to be blunt, i really don't pity your situation. first off, you went into a gate camp and got roasted alive. i'm going to guess it was 5 v 1. and your complaining that two zealots blew you to bits. claiming it was module lag....right, i can see why ccp won't. even if you didn't have the claimed ""module lag"" i'm pretty sure you would have been destroyed. you tried to solo pvp and got destroyed over it. yeah, you totally deserve reimbursement....in my opinion, the policy doesn't need a change. no support. --isaac"
3/28/2009,this.to be honest i've sat here staring at this post several times trying to figure out whether this is a justifiable proposal or not...and honestly i keep coming to one conclusion.whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!?!!?!?!!seriouslyi get the fact you flew your fancy ship into a gate camp and lagged out.but there is absolutely no way for them to detect a disconnect... its just not how tcp/ip infrastructure works.for all we know it could be the jerk down the street downloading a ton of torrents on your isp's bandwidth.... some nut case plowing into a power line.... or a moron tripping over a cat 5 connection and quickly plugging it back in.all of this over a ship.yeah... sorry.i'm sure if i flew my freighter into a gate camp.. i'd be screaming too...wait.... i wouldn't fly my freighter into a gatecamp....tankable or not.because its a bloody gate camp
3/28/2009,are you stupid ?? do you think two zealots can break a officer fitted kronos tank with 2vollys? and roll your eyes again to darkness the lord ill slap you in the face
3/28/2009,"lol, you are for real or you were born that stupid?learn to read my half-brained friend: ship was reimbursed because ccp admitted it was a bug and the issue is something totally different. what? ill leave that to you (or ask your parents - maybe they can read and translate it for you).anyho, /signed for actually getting some rules for reimbursement. atm its totally random stuff, sometimes people get ships (even including caps) reimbursed after the battles (ccp never reimburses fleetbattle losses, amrite?) where in clear documented cases (including fraps) there is no reimbursement.so not only ya need to make clear when reimbursement is possible but what can be reimbursed.drake draconisminmatarshadow cadreworlds end consortiumyou sir are also stupid and your reading comprehension is that of 5 year old."
3/28/2009,hey.... for all we know this could be just a cleverly crafted argument all because someone was asleep at the wheel.
3/28/2009,trolling. -weatherman
3/28/2009,"no, ccp gave ship back because damage recieved server side was 2700 wheras actual hitpoints of his ship were over 25000 (and thats not including resists).i guess ya never lost battleship to claw in 2 seconds, by being one-salvoed? next time stfu and dont make fool of yourself."
3/28/2009,"moderated. -weathermanin anycase. i happen to fly heavy assaults, and i'd like to see the killmails to see what those zeolots were packing. i severely doubt that it was all due to lag, as hacs are well known for chewing through anything larger than a cruiser.if the case of the bug is true, good for you in getting your ship back, but nothing else here makes me think the re-imbursement system is bugged, or in need of work.not supported."
3/28/2009,"i pity your loss, but i'm not really sure what ccp can do here. either they remove those modules from the hangars of the people who picked them up - hardly fair to them - or they open a loophole you could drive a truck through whenever a bug opens. fly officer-fit ship into combat, lose officer-fit ship to bug, drop officer gear, get officer gear reimbursed. suddenly, you and your ""enemy"" have made 3 billion for a few minutes' work. if you can come up with a solution that works better than the status quo i'm all ears, but i don't see what it would be."
3/28/2009,"probably not paying attention eating chillilasagne full of leeks !!!!!least you got the ship back , pity about the mods"
3/28/2009,"wow, i must have touched a nerve. by the way, because you reported drake, i feel its my responsibility to tell you i reported you. sucks doesn't it. now that we are over that little hump....i see what the op is saying and agreeably ccp should have rules on reimbursement. (although i'm of the opinion that reimbursement shouldn't happen at all because it could be just as easily your fault as it could have been ccp's fault) but i don't suppose you would mind maybe having a suggestion of what those rules could be?--isaac"
3/28/2009,"he probably doesn't, and i still haven't heard him explain how he takes on two hacs alone. all bugs and lag aside. marauders aren't exactly made for solo-pvp."
3/28/2009,i agree with this statement if you do allow both sides to get a copy of the modules youl have people exploiting it eg: you get your ship popped by the glitch and than have your offline corpmates log on and recover your items giving you 2 sets. i do not support this unless ccp devises some system to track module ownership and fraud. once this is in place i will support changing this policy.
3/28/2009,"right now ccp is not aware of hp bug, and frankly i am also skeptical since i didn't encounter it myself and have not seen other people showing impossible kills.if your kronos died to a single frigate, maybe 2 frigates, then we'd have serious evidence of something wrong.anyway, if you hope to get your ship back, you first have to help ccp identify the bug - if it exists. without that, there's no ground for reimbursement."
3/28/2009,"supported, but don't get your hopes up.i asked about this at last years fanfest, and it doesn't look to be on the horizon."

3/28/2009,"sad situation, yeah, but i doubt anyone at ccp will give a flying f*** about it."

3/28/2009,"if you're transporting a skillbook, you're doing it for someone else. this wouldn't change that.also: jumpclones.yeah, somehow i doubt that.kind of like how you were too lazy to come up with a real argument? probably the only valid argument in this thread. though i have a little bit of faith left in ccp that they haven't gone that soft.supported for ""why the hell not?""edited for potentially huge isk sink."
3/28/2009,"says the pot calling the kettle black.it is a lazy mans feature.and today i came ""that"" close to agreeing with you..but your smug-assed remark turned me off./me thumbs downhowever ignoring said persons argument... i'm open to injection only under strictest of conditions.like the fact you can inject based on the fact your going to meet said prereqs within the 24 hour skill queue time.that...is rational and sensible."
3/28/2009,umm.. no.dont see the point of injecting a skill you cant train for months. maybe if you can only inject a skill that you will be able to train after your current skill ends.
3/28/2009,"based on the skill queue being created to allow someone to effectivly train their characters when they can only log on perhaps once a day, at a restricted time, and whereas the inability to inject skills without prereqs prevents this goal from being completely met, i support this idea. there really isn't a bad side to it, other than the confusion that might come from someone injecting a book, and not knowing that that doesn't give them the ability to use it until it's trained. this can be prevented with a simple notification window when injecting a non-pre-reqd skill, informing the player of such."
3/28/2009,"actually, jora'h, cores have and always have had a sensor strength of 40. dss probes got theirs hacked from 20 to 5. the reason a result at 2 au on dss and 2 au on core is the same now is because 2 au is the minimum for a dss, but 8 times the minimum of a core, despite having 8 times the strength. how an ""advanced variant"" of the probes with an ""expanded sensor suite"" is beyond me - by the numbers, someone just took the regular core sensors and adjusted them to look farther, resulting in an increase of range for a proportional decrease in strength. that's not advanced at all. that's bogus. a strength of at least 10 would make sense for an ""advanced"" probe with that range.basically, dss probes are ""long-range cores,"" and they're not very desirable at all because of this huge hit. in fact, they're even worse than cores since refining a scan is impossible with them. not hard, impossible. dss are supposed to be the specialized exploration probes, while cores were supposed to be the ""crappy do-it-all"" probes.and yes, i am in the hard sciences. that's why i said ""no scientist in their right mind."" with that said, i think it is fairly agreeable that astrometrics would fall under the so-called ""hard sciences"". an experimenter will only throw out a data point if it is very clearly not the same result, and its value and error range does not overlap or coincide with any of the other values and their respective error ranges by a certain margin.nyah. the flip side of your argument is also applicable: what is the reward for players that train hard to use the ""exploration-specialized probes""? right now: jack and s***, and jack is stuck in w-space."
3/28/2009,"""long-range cores"" is about the reason, yeah. try scanning stuff out in a 200 au wide system, and tell me cores are up to the task. if you're in big systems, and want to get a result without some exhaustive and irritating searching, use deep space probes. do they need more use? they're narrow, but exceptionally good at their niche. i say i won't bother with astro 5 because i'm not a serious scanner, people who are will likely get enough use out of it(and the 8th probe) to justify training it."
3/28/2009,"that's just it, though. scanning a 200-au system is easy with cores, easier than with dss's. systems that large have widely-spaced middle and outer planets, and it's not hard to set a few cores to 8-16 au around each planet or the inner cluster of planets and scan each area one at a time (since no cosmic sig is more than 4 au from a warpable object - unless such things have changed?). the main advantage of dss probes was that they could easily scan the more dense systems with relative ease - systems with 8-12 or more planets packed in a 30-60 au radius. dss probes allowed you to get a fix on the approximate location of each result +/- about 1-0.5 au so you wouldn't be scanning different results with higher-resolution probes as you were trying to get fixes on each.still, you leave my questions unanswered: why is an advanced variant probe specialized for exploration, particularly en masse, effectively no better than the standard ""basic"" probe aside from increased range - and worse due to the inability to fine-tune? furthermore, how is the game mechanic justified in only using 4 probes to calculate the final accuracy? granted, more than 4 produces diminishing returns, but each one still increases the accuracy of the result up to a certain point, given proper and effective trilateration (more appropriate term). new players will usually at least train astrometrics 3 and be using 6 probes when scanning."
3/28/2009,"hey,as u all know ccp personel is allowed to play on the live servers as they please. obviously without using any commands to spawn themselfs stuff etc.but theres other ways to get very very rich.this thread is about one of those ways. inside trading: trading items/goods using non-public information gained trough means of working at ccp. even short glances at global economy figures during database access can be enough to get very rich in the right hands. and hey everyone wanna have a lotta isk in eve right?does this stuff get investigated (it does in the real world)? and are there limits to how rich someone working at ccp is allowed to become in eve online tq server?id."
3/28/2009,"for years now this has been of big concern to me as you can do basicly anything given enough isk, u can even fund wars, getts lotts of people following your cause, basicly you can completely unbalance the game depending what you do with the isk.and isk makes isk, if you know what to buy and sell because you have real figures to work with that other people dont. talking manny trillians of isk here. complete market control.internal affairs, do you investigate this and are there limits?"
3/28/2009,"1: your obviously not using spell checker and type like 5 year old.2: you have zero evidence.3: you forgot your tinfoil hat.4: you epically failed to troll ccp.insider trading is a term used to define the act of someone taking company information they work for and using that information on the stock market to turn a profit and making it look like they got damn lucky.for you to use such a ""grownup term"" in the context of eve is laughable.everything is obviously pubilc knowledge as far as prices go... duh?all you people who whine about ccp playing amongst you... where's your proof? all i see is you claiming they do this... and yet there is no proof.seriously... get a grip on reality well yah?even if they did.... your still not producing proof.. put up or shut the hell up."
3/28/2009,"if you keep this up i will report you for harassment.on topic:proof: ccp ceo made public statement when the whole t2 incident went down that they will allways play on the live servers.thats enough to know that they are on the live servers and they are making isk for themselfs in eve. the question is how much isk? and do they use information they gained from working at ccp in their free time on their player characters.we do not all have access to the same amount of information. for one markets are regional, resources required to construct something thats in development, ccp is allways first to know (way before it even getts on the test servers). the most information is inside the eve database, all trading is recorded its easy to keep track of market tendancys. so no we really dont have the same level of information as ccp.and the question is aimed at ccp internal affairs, not someone like you obviously baised to believe nobody @ ccp ever does anything wrong (history has proven different allready, hence why the internal affairs was created)."
3/28/2009,yet again you rabble on without proof...let alone a spell checker.go ahead and report me.... your just a whiny child with no hope of achieving anything other than encouraging paranoia and conspiracy theories.go on now... put on your tin foil hat and repeat after meccp is out to get usccp is out to get usccp is out to get ussay it enough times... it might actually come true!you never know!yep... laugh of the day here.... classy stuff.
3/28/2009,"ccp have an internal affairs department which monitors all their accounts for anything strange. this is done fairly regularly and from what we saw in iceland, all the staff take ia very very seriously. if you think they are doing what you described, please let the ia guys know and they will investigate."
3/28/2009,i have no doubt that they take the ia very very seriously. but is it within the confines of what they are allowed to do? affect eve on a global scale and become insanely rich? are there rules that say they are not allowed to have more than 1 trillian isk (random figure)?because i believe they have no rules about this at all. all we know is that they are not allowed to spawn themselfs stuff.
3/28/2009,for all we know they are spying on your computer.... watching your keystrokes... tracking your movements.... every single little website you visit.... all of your bank accounts.why... the thought alone is staggering.someone should contact the authorities!

3/28/2009,"recent events..

3/28/2009,a game with a global economy where developers play on the live servers and are abble to affect the game is insane. so yes we need rules for them to be allowed to play on it.this is our game that they made for us.what are the rules their personel have to follow?
3/28/2009,"then why the hell didn't you ask for that in the first place?why come up with some stupid harebrained idiotic accusation with no proof or basis which would lead us down this stinky rabbit trail of an thread which obviously is nothing more than someones stupid little soap box demanding answers which could have easily been accomplished by petitioning or contacting internal affairs directly?or are you just doing this because you wish to draw attention to yourself and shout ""the sky is falling!!!"""

3/28/2009,i knew there was a reason i liked the fact your in csm.o7 @ vista
3/28/2009,"yeah, read lavista's post. also, who the heck are you to demand that ccp have rules for their game when they obviously do? ccp made this game. they can just as easily unmake it. live with it.--isaac"
3/28/2009,this.. with a longer timer all ppl would have to do is fuel up the pos with just enough to online it for an hour or a day.. what ever it takes to reset the timer.
3/28/2009,"this also is a problem of towers being reserved from the standings game as well. the standings check is ony there for anchoring a tower, so you go around in the 7 days you have good standings for, and anchor a bunch of towers. then, once you really want to use them, you can online and anchor the goodies. it's gaming the system, because teh system allows, and even encourages it. that's not to say that this is right. the entire high-sec pos mechanics should be changed. offline towers anchoring shoudl decay. fueling costs should be related to standings (certainly a much higher charter expense with insufficient standings). the 7 day window thing for anchoring needs to change, so that corps must maintain standings to keep their pos affordable. howerver, changing this by itself would cause other problems... so many high-sec pos's would become unusable, thereby greatening the slot shortage issue. this should be covered by public availibility of pos slots (with the appropriate changes that this would require). this would allow intrepid individuals who did maintain their standings to offer the slots up for rent. this would remove the necessity for a lot of those 'placeholder' towers out there."
3/28/2009,won't someone just fuel the tower and charge more for the pos selling to counter any offline pos removal idea?
3/28/2009,totally depends on the costs involved.
3/28/2009,yes.... but it makes it go from a no effort type of situation to an bloody annoyance.
3/28/2009,"within certain limits. for example you can currently evade concord, with black ops ships by jumping to low sec. i think that, being able to gank someone in high sec and then being able to cyno to low sec should be fair game. black ops are not all that common, and if somehow you get tackled, its game over.with wormholes, i think raids into empire space should be possible and allow you to jump back through. now this might mean that players would have to start policing, themselves. they would deduce that if a black ops ship didn't attack them then it, is possible that a wormhole in the system, is responsible so they scan it out and destroy the pirates/whateveryouliketocallthem.concord evasion should not be an offence in certain situations. other ways of evasion should not be possible apart from black ops and wormhole evasion."
3/28/2009,i don't know whether to cry at the insanity... or to laugh uncontrollably.
3/28/2009,i fully support this. this is what is needed to make missions more fun

3/28/2009,havent got any kills latly dont get any kills from npc's or damn sick of ur loss mailseither way to much of the eve community like kill mails u get to see what ships u killed wat was fitted and much more
3/28/2009,"this is not correct. ships with no aggression timer will disappear after 30 sec. if they have aggression (i.e. have engaged a gate, station, can, other player with an offensive module and such) they have a 15 min timer before they disappear.and with the new probing mechanics it is impossible to catch them before they are gone as they will not be under the 15 min aggression timer. (if i read the op correct. we are talking ratters farming safe isk in 0.0, yes? )i agree with the op. the covops cloak and ships that can fit those have got a role. but when every ship can fit a cloak and become invulnerable, that is just wrong imo. some sort of penalty should be applied to using a cloak that brings the ""risk"" aspect into it. not just the ""reward"". an agility penalty perhaps?? a ""delayed warp out"" mechanic??at least something that makes ship using a prototype cloaking device have to take some risk. we are talking about 0.0 space after all. and it is not supposed to be safe.i would also like it if cloaking ships using a regular cloaking devices (non-covert ops cloaks)can be probed out and caught with a well skilled character. it shouldn't be easy, but it should be possible imo.and don't get me started about the macro/bot players"
3/28/2009,cloaks are already balanced and fitting one comes with penalties - no change is needed.
3/28/2009,and what penalty would that be?? the scan res penalty and activation delay??doesn't address the problem. and they can hardly be called balanced when they make ppl invulnerable.
3/28/2009,"as i told the last million threads on this subject....no. unless ccp changes how cloaking and all related mechanics to cloaking, there is no change needed. --isaacp.s. no reason needed because i stated it a million times. you have no real solution. your demanding ccp change the problem, but you have no suggestions. this isn't the ""qq this mechanic sucks"" forum. its the bring your suggestions here forum."
3/28/2009,"i agree that cloaked ships invulnerability really is a pain.trying to catch a ratter with a cloak is pretty much pointless any more, and searching for a red in local with a cloak is simply a waste of time.the principal of extended cloaking should be limited to specific ships, and while others may use them it should be heaily limited in use.perhaps introduce a cap usage on activation, this would be a drain of a fixed percent rather than an actual amount. the rational being that a larger ship requires more energy to remain cloaked, so perhaps an activation cost of something like 10 percent. if for the sake of argument the duration is 1 minute, then any ship using a prototype can remain cloaked for 10 minutes max. long enough to take a bio, however not long enough to simply wait out a searching fleet.i see this as a dynamic that would nerf titans in some way too, requiring them to be more often visible on grid, and therefore open to attack or at least their position and alignment known.users of cov-ops cloaks would have zero activation cost, and therefore operate as before.zos"
3/28/2009,"a non-covert ship with a cloak can barely move, can't warp,and can't attack. during the times the ship is ""invulnerable"" every other ship in the system is also invulerable to the cloaked ship (balance achieved). if the cloaker de-cloaks there is a delay before they can lock and they have weakened the combat ability of the ship by attaching the cloak that takes significant cpu and a high slot. simple test: take any two identical combat ships and two identical pilots. put a cloak on one of the ships. fit them with the best possible pvp fit with the exception of the cloak. have the cloaker de-cloak next to the other ship and attack. due to the delay in firing and the sacrifice of the cpu and high-slot the ship with the cloak will most likely explode."
3/28/2009,eve-online would be a better game without local and without non-covert op cloaking devices.it would end the isk farming problem.
3/28/2009,listen to this man.... or forever be labeled dumb.spot on...
3/28/2009,"the way rights are organized period. needs to be taken into consideration, and better documented. the sheer bureaucracy thats being forced upon alliances just to function is absurd."
3/28/2009,supported - just because it'll make drake draconis and efrim black cry more.
3/28/2009,"the purpose of all these is to fund pvp. what the point of the game, watching your wallet grow and paint dry?forcing people out if npc corps does nor necessarily force them into combat - it just makes them equally vulnerable as all the other players. it may cause them to pay for protection or grow a spine and protect themselves or cooperate with others - there are many options."
3/28/2009,"mining in my system. i did one run.took roughly 15 minutes, hulk w/cargo ii & cargo rigs for 17,991m3 cargot2 strip miners with t1 crystals (only available atm)i mined in one load + added it to my small unpreocessed (i.e. below min amt to refine from last reprocess) to get:170,000k dense veld45.09k veld2,115 condensedwith my efficiency, i'm not in a high standing station but close so it yields to 685,877 units of trit.at the running price of 4.20isk that's 2.8milin that one load i could have done half a mission (~500k) and downed 4 bs rats at let's say 500k. that's 2.5m not counting loot and salvage.so no, missioning is a lot faster in terms of making isk.in fact, i ran lvl 4s in tandem today and did 3 ""easy"" ones in about 2 hours, and made 8.8mil on bounties and mission time rewards- this oes not count loot & salvage, nor does it count the faction drop i got. this was shared, so count double that as my counterpart didn't do much in the missions.but this is getting off topic, so i'll stop here."
3/28/2009,"what about people in major alliances creating freighter/hauler alts to do all their important logistics work with 0.00001% risk factor? instead of 0.1% that they would get with war dec.0.0 logistics is already safer than empire since alliance people in 0.0 never use stargates, only jumping between deathstar pos. and then they hide in noob corp for the empire side of the business.new players also benefit from getting early exposure to pvp. if they grow old in eve without ever leaving safety of noob corp, they become weak and too content with the carebear lifestyle, without realizing what they are missing out.this game shouldn't be too easy. and we should accept that this game isn't for everyone. the weak must adapt or be greifed into quitting. keep eve community healthy."
3/28/2009,you people are utterly stupid beyond all reason.it's truely sad.... you can't see any further than the end your damn cannon.get a freaking brain and try to figure out why this proposal gets shot downeveryfrakkingsingletimeoverandoveragain!!!!<sorry trying to drill it in for emphasis>
3/28/2009,"oh, i'm fairly certain this will be a no go as usual.on a side note drake... i see you here so much... when do you find time to actually play?"
3/28/2009,"<grins>i have multitasking v.^_^and yes.. i am on... just ask de'veldrinbroke in my new orca today. as to your comment on the thread...this is the same song next verse number 100,000,000you'd think....people would figure it out... its a no-win situation... you favor one side.. its unbalanced...npc...or pvp.... you will never reach a conclusion without compromising the other."
3/28/2009,"true enough.. while there are ppl who abuse npc corps, there are also ppl who have legit reasons for being in them. i spent a while in them myself when i didnt have net access at home cause i didnt feel it was fair to a player corp to sign up when i didnt know for sure when i could play. had nothing to do with the fact that i dislike pvp for the most part. the only reason i offer ideas to some of the things i reply to is that i have a habit of trying to see things from both/all sides of an issue. not always possible but i try. hell some of the ideas i've posted have been along the lines of a random ""what if"" moment.. i know they wont necessarily be good ideas, but i float them out there for a response and feedback hoping that it leads to an actual good idea."
3/28/2009,"so basically, your way is the only way to play the game. nice. do you even realize what an unmitigated a$$hat you sound like? sadly, probably not. this is, essentially, a whining rant against people who have already left npc corps - they just keep alts in them.on a side note:since griefing is clearly against the established rules of the game (if not the eula) and is a bannable offense, we'll be expecting your resignation/banning imminently for advocating its use.can i haz ur stuffs?"
3/28/2009,"i do not support this. i fail to see how you can properly learn from veterans in the game, if you do not chat with them. the easiest way to accomplish this is to talk to the vets hanging out in noob corp chat."
3/28/2009,"okfirst off i sincerely apologize if i trolled you a little to much.i would be hypocritical if i didn't respect the effort your putting into making new ideas.at least you have the sense to reason it out.secondly.... as ive said before... most of these pvp idiots fail to remember that 75 to 80% of the npc corpies are in fact... alts of major alliance/corporation pilots trying to sneak around and do business they normally cannot accomplish.and until you get that through your frakking thick skulls (yells at the rest of the pvp'ers)your going to look like a bunch of idiots.just forcing someone to do something to your so called demands is considered criminal in this game.i did not buy a subscription to this game to be forced to play by someone else's rules.eve is a game of chaos and sandbox... you make your own damn rules and you for the most part do as your bloody well please.the moment that changes... is the moment i quit spending my hard earned money on it and go somewhere else.i choose to be an industrialist so i can make lots of isk and stash it away for the day i can afford to blow gobs of ships up just by pvp'in like the rest of you... because the funny thing is... you guy's don't even get paid peanuts to do it!stop assuming the world orbits around you.... you ignorance on the matter is obvious.also keep in mind that i do not favor the ""carebears"" in this matter either.we need equal portions of both pvp'ing and ""carebears"" as you would put it.it keeps the game intersting... having it go full pvp or full ""carebears"" would suck."
3/28/2009,"nope, though it would help fight off the macro's it makes it too easy to grief ppl."
3/28/2009,"this is easy to fix, just one toon /account...1. - new players shouldn't be forced to do anything, the moment you ""force"" someone like me *anywhere* - i kick back, in this case, stop paying.2. - realize what they are missing? c'mon! you cannot be that self-centered! pvp just is not for everyone. most of you are too young to remember elite, but eve does the best job of bringing that game into the 21st century... please, not everyone wants to/needs to play your way... the game isn't easy. the learning cliff takes out quite enough people now. as for greifing people into quitting? hmmmm, i believe ccp has an answer for that... no!"
3/28/2009,"so what your saying is you want to cut down on the funding of pvp?you're not very bright. some people don't like playing the game the way you do. just like in real-life. not everyone likes to do the same thing.so get off your little pedestal and ""grow a spine"" and learn to deal with reality."
3/28/2009,"of course yes. losses have to hurt.thanks. i don't need appreciation from an isk farmer.sure. so, go back to wow or hello kitty online, or go dress barbie dolls, whatever makes you feel good, just don't ruin the only decent pvp game."
3/28/2009,"this post has been cleared of inappropriate content.regards,the eve online moderation team"
3/28/2009,"quote of a moderated post. -weathermanalso, i think you may need to take your tin-foil hat off. i'm not in an npc corp. to address the rest of your rhetorical spin, nothing about npc corps makes this wow. there is still plenty of pvp to go around, i'm sorry you're not getting enough industrials on your kill-mails - taking that out here will get you a pat on the head, and ridicule.i for one don't really care that you don't like npc corps. ccp isn't going to just penalize people for not wanting to spam up the game with even more 1 man-corps.go war-dec some macro-mining corp, and stop wasting your time trying to sound intelligent."
3/28/2009,"plays an online game to grow his wallet, avoids interaction with other players and never pvps - yep, that's your typical npc corp farmer."
3/28/2009,"except i'm broke in game, from losing a ship in wormhole space. in pvp. i also founded my own corp. i was in an npc corp for quite a long time. not to make money, you sniveling rat, but to learn how to play the game.some people are slow starters. bumping this moronic slag-fest won't change that. nor your paltry amount of support."
3/28/2009,"this game is built on greifing people, some to the point of quitting. ccp are themselves the biggest greifers in eve. because 9 out of 10 new people who try play this game get so bored or frustrated at what ccp forced them to work with, that they quit the game without ever getting into it. then there are thousands of players who quit routinely over the game changes ccp introduces with patches, or because of the negative answers they get in petitions.and if ccp wants to keep their game from turning into wow clone, they will continue to encourage greifing, separate the weak from the strong. no single player or corp has caused more greif to players than ccp"
3/28/2009,7 out of 10 people agree.. your full of ####.oh... you don't like it when i make statistics up on the spot?sez you : o p
3/28/2009,"the ability to import and export fittings is a great idea but i think there should be an option that would allow you to specify an export format that eft or evemon can understand, because right now it only exports as raw xml which is pretty much useless because none of the fitting utilities use it"
3/28/2009,/signed
3/28/2009,why is the onus here on ccp to fix it? let the eft people learn how to read xml.
3/28/2009,"agreed... this is something they need to fix in eft, not in eve. eve has the ability to export and import it's own fittings, so they can be shared with whomever you choose, that is enough. ccp should not be responsible for tailoring the game to 3rd party tools."
3/28/2009,"two specific issues directly related to current scoop mechanics:1) when you command some light drones, specifically warrior iis to ""return to drone bay,"" often 1-2 will try to return, but for what ever reason they don't stop mwding when they get into scoop range and as such they will orbit in and out of scoop range while continuously running their mwds. its a minor issue, but it adds a lot of extra time and attention to achieve what should otherwise be a relatively mundane task (getting your drones back into the drone bay.)to solve the issue, which seems to be a relative recent bug, would be to simply fix/change back, what ever changes caused this or to simply make drones turn off their mwds once they are in scoop range (most times at least some of the warrior iis do this, just make them all do it.)2) the second issue that in my opinion is tantamount to a ""flawed"" drone scoop mechanics and which seems to cause more headaches then anything else in this regard, are the current sentry drone scoop mechanics. the issue is prevalent in carriers, but it defiantly affects several other ships/classes of ships as well. the issue is especially noticeable in pos sieges when your sentry drones, for what ever reason, wander/drift several kilometers away in various directions and can take several minutes to fly after to scoop them all (the other option being the continuous scooping and redeploying of sentries to keep them close.) often this extra time (flying after them if some all get out of range) cannot be taken and one is forced to either abandon or leave 10-20 mil worth of t2 sentries in space (less, obviously in the case of t1 sentries.) the issue could be fixed easily enough with a 50-100 m/s return velocity for sentry drones.a third issue, less directly related to drone scoop mechanics then the first two issues, but in some respects related none the less is the ""issue"" of sentry guns aggroing drones in low sec. it's fair enough that drones are freely targeted and killed by other npc entities, specifically rats, but rats also tracking disrupt, sensor damp, apply ecm, fire defenders and neut/nos cap. all these issue affect various other forms of weapons systems.sentries on the other hand apply none of these ""tactics"" against players and their weapons systems, they do none the less, target and destroy drones (often in 1-2 volleys.) all this seems to do is limit if not remove dedicated drone boats from gate and station camping in low sec. don't get me wrong, people still find ways to very successfully camp gates and stations, they just for the most part rely on non-drone boats to do this.drone boats are by their very natures balanced around the use of their drones just as other types of (pvp) ships are balanced around the use of their weapons systems, why specifically limit (if not remove) the use of dedicated drone boats near gates and stations and none of the other weapon types?i could see issues with gate camps supported by posed carriers with assigned fighters, but maybe in the case of fighters continue to have sentry drones shoot them, but it seems, i hate to use this term, ""unfair"" to limit the use of dedicated drone boats and only dedicated drone boats at gates and stations, where the majority of low sec small gang engagements take place."
3/28/2009,what purpose would this serve? how is this possibly worth considering in any way? npc corporations are the default 'none' anyways. that you end up with a chat channel you can completely ignore is just a side effect.
3/28/2009,no for many of the reasons already stated. on the other hand this gives me an idea..
3/28/2009,issler dainze - voice of reason candidatewebsite (soon (tm))eve online forum thread (soon(tm))
3/28/2009,firstly i would like to wish you luck in your campaign. i voted for anhk in the last election as i think she did an excellent job in the first term and seems to have done so this time round as well. in regards to this section of your manifesto i am very interested to hear your thoughts in this area as i too would love to see that come into play in eve. please feel free to contact me in any way you see fit about this or simply post your thoughts and ideas here.
3/28/2009,confirming i will be voting for this candidate :d
3/28/2009,"hello erik,i created the csm chat channel for this very purpose, and the third csm is welcome to use it to keep in touch with the playerbase. i agree with your viewpoints on informing the players of csm activity, but i am currently drawn between you and dierdra for the csm vote (i only have one vote).that being said, i am against the concept of a party in any political system, let alone eve. if take care is an ethic rather than a party, i'd be all for it (as i tried to implement that very concept in csm2).keep up the good work, and i wish you the best in the upcoming election."
3/28/2009,"i have to concede that despite 'corporate differences' i would certainly vote for lark as he at least has an idea of what he is talking about and appears to have some kind of vision insofar as to the role (unlike some [cat'o'ninetails]).i have read your blog (very kind of someone to make that for you) and think your ideas are well thought out, well presented and balanced. good luck with it, lark. i for one, hope you make it.kras.edited for spelling(beer does that)."
3/28/2009,"i would be happy to see someone representing mercs on the csm, but alas i dont have the time to do so mahself.larkonis! what you gonna do for mercs?"
3/28/2009,"hello,after taking some time to reflect on comments both in forums and conveyed directly about my proposal for a political party to represent the players often described as ""carebears"" i have decided to run for the third council for stellar management.i will be doing this to guaranty that the proposed ""voice of reason"" party will have a candidate in the elections. i will be driving party focused dialogs to establish the core tenants of this political organization.at this time i have not formally submitted my application for the election but will complete that in time to comply with the deadline.first steps now will be to establish the party and develop the political process to create our visions. these early steps will include:1. creation of party forums and website.2. establishment of the process to join.3. establishment of the party ""planks"".4. a virtual party convention.5. pre-election activities to raise visibility and participation.other early activities will be creation of logo and selection of a slogan for the party for this election.i want to make it clear that other candidates can join this party and process if they commit to the part values. if prior to the election we determine that the party needs to field a reduced set of candidates or even a single candidate i support the idea of an election as part of the virtual convention to select the candidates the party will vote for (i will gladly submit to another candidate if the party determines that this will best represent their interests in the csm process).so i hope many of you will join me in this new experiment in eve politics.issler dainzeceo tadakatsu obata corporationfounder of the honda accordcsm ii memberfounder of the eve ""voice of reason"" party"
3/28/2009,"issler,i agree with you in the call for a party. and as my colleague, ankhesentapemkah, has already pointed out above : the call has been heard and take care was formed. did you have a look? take care is a promise to the voter : give us your vote - we will use it well, and we will even tell you why.continuity - not conservatism, but using the methods, which were found during a term, also in the next term. take care delegates need not re-invent the wheel in the council's next term. we have a network to communicate to pilots, to the council, and eventually to ccp.efficiency - we are offered a supreme opportunity of participation by ccp in building the best game universe ever. take care will make sure that council discussions are aimed at one supreme goal : put the voter's voice through to ccp. discussions and conflicts must be fought out with that one thought in mind that an issue entry needs to be shaped for ccp to understand.communication - i know from my own experience how hard it was during the first term to reach information about the topics, which were discussed in the council. thanks to take care, i had a competent partner, who would not throw incomprehensible minutes at me, but explained what essentially was going on.dialog - take care does not make an end to the eternal fight between industry and piracy. we keep the fire burning, in fact, we turn up the heat. i enjoy mining outside high-sec a lot more because risk is involved. more than taking a position towards industry, take care takes the position of the moderator, who makes sure every voice is heard. who understands the need to shape an idea, which is in the end put onto the table of the council and has a chance for a majority. for a better game !i agree very much with herschel yamamoto in that point : take care is a platform to let this conflict be discussed, to let it be discussed by many many pilots, and to build a strong position from that discussion which can be put onto the table of the council.take care, party for eve csm(edited for layout...)"
3/28/2009,"i'm with you issler. at least insofar as it will not effect the freedom that makes playing eve so great. i would be excited to support a canditate who would, (for example) help push the already discussed sov changes that might encourage alliances to be more inclusive to peaceful players. that would be a change that would benefit the game in the long run by forcing more interaction between players. that is really what makes mmo's so great in the first place. if thats you i'm on board."
3/28/2009,why are you posting a campaign advertisement in a thread about the formation of a separate party?
3/28/2009,"2nd csm formal meeting 10 - sunday 5th of april 16:00 hours eve time.agenda: announcements: 1. 2. csm raised issues - (csm delegates must 1. reply to this thread listing the issue name and assembly hall thread they wish to advocate and 2. supply the issue in templated form to csm wiki)1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. popular issue (biggest unaddressed assembly hall issue <U+FFFD> will be added after csm raised issues.)1. aob (any other business) 1. 2. ***all csm delegates and alternates are invited to attend. can i ask the moderation team to pay special attention to this thread please and ensure that it is kept free of trolling, flaming and personal attacks and is able to serve its intended purpose of allowing csm delegates to list the issues they wish to be heard in the next meeting and for members of the eve public to ask questions in a respectful and civil tone.thank you"
3/28/2009,ofcourse that would be sunday 5th of april 16:00 hours eve time
3/28/2009,and this is the man running our alliance... :cripes:<3 vuk
3/28/2009,any progress on this?
3/28/2009,"""very soon(tm)"" instead of just ""soon(tm)"", i'm affraid."
3/28/2009,well thats something i suppose.thanks ankh.
3/29/2009,"i love 90% of the updated effects but i have to agree you fumbled the ball on this one ccp give us the womf, the omg! the brown pants time. that these vessals deserve.please"
3/29/2009,the old one was alot more dramatic.
3/29/2009,even if i can't watch it devour the amarr system!
3/29/2009,"i would understand them saying flat out no if we asked for it next week, but we can wait, we just want them to start work in it. how long it takes is no issue as long as the current pos's get the job done. but at this point, its like they are ignoring pos's and how bad they are in favor of new stuff. i do understand the importance of new content but ccp do need to think of all the players that end up running all these pos's. they said that they would like sov mech and pos's to be addressed post trinity and we have seen nothing changed.if anything all i and a lot of others want is a simple answer, if not today then when will our stick pos's be replaced with something that looks like a player owned station, and when will you quit disappointing new players who get excited about seeing there first pos only to be let down with the junk in space that it is today."
3/29/2009,"yes i bashed into their heads that there should really be an interbus station to at least fix empire standings. on the pirate ones they were very vague, but said they would like to see some mechanics that allow it. don't expect anything soon for them though. faction standings really need to be dynamic based on game events, imo, it makes no sense to have them fixed like this."
3/29/2009,supported. i would to fly minmatar caps but with the current broken state of them i abandoned the idea in favour of another race.zos
3/29/2009,what? the nag does the lowest damage of all 4 dreads by a large margin. maybe it's because it's 6am here but out of siege damage what on earth are you talking about i'm completely lost.
3/29/2009,awesome idea and much needed. traing to switch from nid to hel is painful.
3/29/2009,minmatar ships are made from trash and should also have trash weapons
3/29/2009,"nope. this is in eft with all level 5 skills. the main reason that the nag does so much better than other dreads is that it uses four weapons instead of three. 2 proj, 2 torps, and an extra slot for the siege mod. it's the only dread with 5 highs. i did not, in that instance, throw damage mods into the mix. that is only the ships themselves plus weapons @ max skills across the board, as well as top-damage non-faction ammo. i did not include the siege mode damage because it is moot - all dreads get the same damage boost from siege mode.however, as i was writing that, i re-did it with siege mode...and the dps results are the same. using long-range turrets, the nag takes the cake at 2497, the rev is a close second at 2470 (although lack of need to reload may make that better), the moros is kinda sad at 1998, and the phoenix is **** poor at 1955.with short-range turrets, the nag again wins at 3163, moros in second with 3088, revelation with 2823, and the phoenix again loses with 2127 (one torp swapped for an ion siege).so yeah, the nag's damage is not bad, per se. you just need to do 2-3 times the training to get it better than everyone else's, and even then, your tanking ability in a nag is awful in relation to other dreads. that's all i'm saying. ..... *weeps at the sorry state of minnie caps*"
3/29/2009,"the main reason the nag is terrible is because you have to fit damage mods for both guns. while a phoenix or rev can throw 3 damage mods on and it applies for all their weapons, the nag throws 4 on and only 2 apply for each weapon. the 4 weapons are completely negated by this fact and the fact that only one of the nag's bonuses applies to each group of weapons (where as the phoenix and rev have two for each gun, the moros has one and the crazy drone bonus). throw in the fact that faction crystals are easy to come by and last a long time and it's easy to see why the rev is the best.this is of course assuming best case scenario setups as most alliances realize how bad the nag is and just brick tank them."
3/29/2009,yes please
3/29/2009,"system/network scannerspersonally, i would prefer something linked to sovreignty as a system scanner. if sov level then you can anchor a module at a tower. make it a big power/cpu module so it cannot be on a deathstar and make it fragile. then you can have a small gang attack the module offline it and then go on there merry way.sov 1 makes people in constellation appear 10 seconds after jump cloak finishes.sov 2 makes people in constellation appear instantlysov 3 makes people in system appear 10 seconds after jump cloak finishessov 4 makes people in system appear instantlythat way, if you hold sov space you get some protection."
3/29/2009,"what protection is local? an arbitrary list of names? how do you know if player x is in a recon or just sitting in a shuttle somewhere?you use the scanner.enhance the scanner. scanner sends out a 10-second cycle ping when it's opened, and the window can be made smaller- in fact, if you remove the local window that people have up separately, you instantly have room to place it. from there on, you can have 2 options, active and passive scanactive scan sends out a ping which signals itself to other players running both and active and passive scan.passive scans are useful when cloaked in a covops. you have a more limited scan range, say -50%, and you cannot activate any weapon groups/modules while in passive mode.an option, to steal from freespace- is to have a scanner able to detect a ""hostile configuration"" which can determine if the ship on scan is set positive or negative based on standings. i don't see why this isn't the best solution.a) players that have these vast empty systems and rely on local/alts to be afk monitors on hostile fleets now will have to defend the space they claim.b) covops can still do recon missions in which they were designed forc) mining ops still have that level of protection, you just can't afk mine solo in yor hulk without at least watching the scanner occasionally for a blip.d) there is still a mystery, especially if the other person is beyond scan range (having a full system scan range negates the purpose if ""hostile configuration"" is implemented.this option keeps your intel tool, that requires some level of intelligence to use, it removes local allowing some mystery and not the instablob of some alliances when you want to come down and have some love.best of all, it makes black ops useful."
3/29/2009,no.
3/29/2009,"so after removing local you give less informations if someone don't use the scanner actively, see that as balanced and think that people will not use it actively. don't work that way. you will get some new player doing that error, but the largest part of the people will be pinging the scanner constantly. and you will be still giving less information on a passive scan. less than the current scanning system and less than active scan.removing the information gathering system can be some pvpers wet dream as they think to get tons of kills that way, but the results will be more blobbing and less kills as people will become even more paranoid and stay in high sec, not the reverse."
3/29/2009,"i am strongly against it.this will not help pvp. it will get some poor random sobs jumped while mining or ratting yes, but actually finding a fight with your enemies will be made harder since you can't tell reasonably quickly where hostiles are unless they're literally on the same grid as you are.i only support specialist cloaked ships not showing on local (while cloaked). that's fair, if you want to sneak up on someone, get a sneaky ship."
3/29/2009,"are you intentionally trying to be obtuse?the 'auto-updating' directional scanner does not need to see anything but manned ships. there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to have real-time updates on unoccupied ships, asteroids, wrecks, pos structures, and all the other crap that the current directional scanner can scan for. all of that can be left for the manual scan that will presumably be left as a sub-function of the new ship's scanner."
3/29/2009,"there is no pvp in w-space. 'cause there is no local there, see?"
3/29/2009,"he's already gotten his ship back, along with the destroyed modules. he's asking for people to get the dropped(i.e., not destroyed) modules back in future as well."
3/29/2009,dang that lucky ****eri lost dozens of multibillion battleships in pvp and i never petitioned them!so ccp officially acknowledges hp bug? they have to if they agreed to reimburse. can we got some official bug hunter or ccp to confirm?
3/29/2009,"i would really appreciate it if people actually read my post, this wasnt about getting reimbursement and it certainly wasnt lag. i didnt mention lag in my post at all i said that 2 zealots killed me in 2 volleys (under 8 seconds) and i've taken on far bigger camps and lived. maurauders for anyone who actually has an iq are perfect ships for pvp they have an awesome bonus to both damage and tanks and the only weakness is ecm atleast in the kronos's case. as i have already said i do not expect reimbursement, my case has already been declined but i think that things need to change for the future."
3/29/2009,"pyramid quoting is not allowed.applebabeare you joking... this post is ridiculous and you are actually stupid. let me put it this way the maurauder has 9k armor 80+% resistances and with t2 aux nano pumps, exile booster and the reppers it repairs 2,719 armor per repper, or 5,438 armor every 11 seconds. wow at taking on 2 hacs, what was i thinking... and just for the record i have fraps of me taking on 15 or so hacs and tanking with ease i can upload if you want me too"
3/29/2009,"this isn't the forum for showing off your internet *****, that would be crime and punishment. that said, tanking 15 hacs with a 3000-ish dps tank sounds like one hell of a feat. their drones alone should down you. also, don't post gm discussions publicly - it's not allowed."
3/29/2009,"dangit, herschel, ya beat me to it. that just goes to prove, go to work for 8 hours, and the whole universe changes while you're gone :)basically, see herschel's post above (^^^^) for the reasons why this will never work. unsupported."
3/29/2009,say... is this something i should report?yeah.... i think i will.
3/29/2009,"has anyone from ccp confirmed existence of hp bug?because if it's real, it's a game breaker"
3/29/2009,"this post has been cleared of inappropriate content.regards,the eve online moderation team"
3/29/2009,"killmails are bugged, *especially* damage dealt. in fact i dare you to find one correct killmail since the last patch. i see you are claiming hp bug, but since ccp denied your request and you cannot show any evidence (logs can be modified and one second of fraps is useless) there is no reason to believe you. i know you are super leader of triumvirate but i have killed some very e-famous people and they *****ed and moaned about lag and dropping when that clearly wasn't the case. would like to hear from the people who killed you since they have little reason to lie.as for getting your modules back, let's think about this, shall we? by using the petition system you know that petitions, especially reimbursement petitions are not answered immediately. in fact, they usually take a few weeks if you escalate them. what happens to dropped modules in a couple of weeks? people sell them of course. so do you yank the module from someone who legally bought the module? no, you have to reverse the entire transaction. now consider the module changes hands multiple times. now you have to reverse a chain of orders and screw up a lot of people's wallets/assets. i think you can see the problems that this will cause. another what if, let's say your corpum lar dropped when you died due to a bug in the game and i loot it. i put it on my kronos. i get killed in a legit manner a few days later and it drops again. ccp grants your petition and all modules. now they either have to yank the lar from someone who fairly got the module in a fight or duplicate the module. you also run into the situation where if you recovered your own loot with an unaffiliated alt and got your ship back, you'd have another corpum lar out of thin air from ccp.you might think it is worth it for your super expensive marauder to go through all of that, but with a standard t2 loss it is too much work and we can't have different treatment for different people just because they lost a few more expensive imaginary pixels.nice little tri threadnaught you got going on here, it's cute :)"
3/29/2009,"no, they haven't i have been in plenty of armor based combat with session changes and have not noticed any problems. i have noticed that modules refuse to online when i first fit them. but anything can happen and strange things have happened on tranquility plenty of times.if there is evidence of an hp bug, we really need to get that narrowed down asap as that would be a show stopping bug."
3/29/2009,"well the bug has been fixed now, but as an extreme example we noticed that just after the patch our titan which was at the time cloaked in a safe had one hundred (100) armor hp.anyway this thread really isnt about the bug or reimbursement for me but as deva said a call out for a clear and fair reimbursement policy for the future. i dont really see why people dont want this, how many people have had petitions that have been succesful then petitioned again with the exact same problem and it gets rejected. there is quite simply no consistency on ccp's part."
3/29/2009,"i have reported your post as it is once again off topic, this isnt about tri or me so please take your bitterness towards us and throw it out the window. read my entire post again and actually try and understand what im saying. this is no mail bug and i got the ship back."
3/29/2009,"while i can see how this works in a 1v2 battle, how does it work in a larger battle, where the process of obtaining your loot may cause several other people to lose their ships doing so, only to then be denied the loot because the original destruction was a bug.yes, it's a bug, yes it sucks, but unless it's an exploit i can't see how you can justify the amount of time it would take to come to a decision about what to do in 'x' situation.you certainly can't give isk as well as the modules, what if an ally scooped the modules, free isk. what if you then knew how to reproduce the bug, more free isk.also, you petitioned and quickly received your ship back ? after a patch even ? wow.keep in mind that with every loser, there is a winner, and when you lose something to a bug, you can think/know it's a bug, but the minute someone loses their loot from someone they killed, it will be for certain, a gm acting inappropriately."
3/29/2009,"i agree it would be difficult if not impossible to take back said items from the players who have them, but if the servers show clearly there was a bug i see no reason why ccp cannot simply give isk as a means of compensation to that player. think about the isk lost even in a fleet battle in loot it would probably come to no more than 1-2 bil even in a battle of 100's of people unless someone fitted pimped gear. that ammount of isk being given back to players for their loot wouldnt make a dent in the economics of eve but it would be fair, which is really what i would like to see. if their logs dont show anything then fine but for the blatant bugs such as mine where yeah within 24 hours i did get the ship back i should also get everything else back. again i am not asking for reimbursement now but merely using my loss as an example because its the best one i have."
3/29/2009,"signed.sucks losing a ship to a ccp ""feature"". good luck recovering."
3/29/2009,"if a bug is identified as a bug and reimbursement takes place, it has to be complete. that would be bad for those who benefited from the bug, as they'd lose the modules. but when did ccp ever allow those who took advantage from a bug allow to keep it? especially not since it even fits the exploit rules. when i shoot something that goes pop so easily that i should know something is amiss, i would have to petition it myself, even if it is to my disadvantage. at least that is what the rules say, when i last checked."
3/29/2009,"this is a toughie on one hand i agree in prinviple that its a tough loss which should have been advoidable, howeveri assume you have been playing a while and know the reimbursement policy, if that is true you should be aware of the tough stance ccp take on these reimbursement issues and also you should know that as soon as you undock anywhere your ship and mods are at risk either due to game mechanics de-sync/lag ecti remember a while a go i undocked in a pod during a war dec, black screened long enough for my pod to go pop losing implants this was petitioned falling on deaf ears :( but i accepted it grudgingly for me travelling in 0.0 and low sec in a faction fitted ship adds to the adrelenien, so with those thoughts and the difficulty ccp have for tracing and returning lost mods i cannot support this although i do feel for your loss and for that im sorry to read what happened"
3/29/2009,thats exactly what i mean though i knew the second i saw those mods lived i wouldnt get them back but i've been far too lazy to fight the cause of full and fair reimbursement because i've never really lost anything of high enough value to bother.but i think its something that should be changed.
3/29/2009,"i would support a fair and standardised method of reimbursement by the gm's and on those accassions where a esculation happens a more human approach is adopted by the gm's rather than them applying rules;1)differantly to differant people2)in cases where a exception can be made based on sound judgement and if the situation warrants it my main gripe with ccp is applying rulings unfairly and differantly to differant players, if your op included a reform of the reimbursement policy and procedure to include my points above - you will have my support :)"
3/29/2009,signzored!
3/29/2009,"since so many morons fail at reading even when the op repeats it.here the story,ship goes into gate camp.ship dies and drops mods.ccp reimburse ship and destroy mods but not the drop mods!here what the op is requesting.that drop mods also be return to the owner of ths ship in a case that ccp does reimburse a ship.i don't see any logical reason not to support. they don't have to take the items from the people who loot the wreck, just give the person all their stuff back.this game is already eats up a lot of time. losing a few billion to a glitch that ccp is willing to reimburse for got to suck."
3/29/2009,"if the proposal read like.""i recently had a ship re-imbursed after i lost it in a glitch. they did not re-imburse the billions of isk worth of modules that dropped from the ship however. this policy should be changed.""i would have supported. instead of that he wrote a two page pity-party about losing is fraking kronos. if he wants my support, he can clean up his main post. or maybe the half-dozen posts in response to dissention that sound like this. """"are you stupid ?? do you think two zealots can break a officer fitted kronos tank with 2vollys? shocked and roll your eyes again to darkness the lord ill slap you in the face""i'm not stupid for thinking a marauder can't tank two hacs solo anyway. neither is isaac. main poster is a rude jackass, and i haven't seen any evidence to support the claim that ccp wouldn't reimburse the modules from a bug-killed ship.personally, i think it's generous they gave him anything."
3/29/2009,"i support this, and i've been wondering why it's been this way for some time. my friend used to fly a typhoon in lvl 4 missions, and it looked like he was giving birth to missiles at a rate that would make rabbits jealous.i don't see how this could add too much effort to the cpu, as we can already turn off a lot of effects. the only thing that would complicate this issue (and not by much, mind you) is finding where to put the things on the already small ships (such as a rifter). the line of effect should be easy for the clients to calculate.signed."
3/29/2009,agreed
3/29/2009,"it's one of those things we all just got used to and to a point accepted, but that doesn't make the request any less valid."
3/29/2009,"i have been wanting something like this since 2003 i guess :pi mean, the icons of the launchers even show how they could look... just put it in allready"
3/29/2009,needs looking at. explosion velocity is ridiculous.
3/29/2009,"definatly supported, the numbers say it all and cit torps are just pathetic currently..."
3/29/2009,so i trained a phoenix a few months ago. the moment it was ready i hopped on sisi and started pew pewing and realized that the missiles go about 1km/s and can't hit anything that moves for any damage at all. the ship is so laughably bad that i sold the character.citadel torps need a big boost for both the phoenix and naglfar's sake. it's really pretty sad how awful those dreads are compared to the others.
3/29/2009,i quote this and remember the thumbs up !
3/29/2009,the concept of a physical skillbook that must be transported makes no sense and adds nothing to the game.
3/29/2009,"there's your problem - the ""within 4 au"" mechanic has changed. stuff can be anywhere now, meaning that a rack of cores isn't enough. also, it's not ""worse"" in any meaningful way, because it's not a choice between the two. you can scan with cores, or you can scan with ds and cores. nobody scans with just ds(at least, not after this nerf). you find it to 2 au range, reel your ds probes, launch cores, and finish the job. adds about thirty seconds to your scan time. as for the four-probe complaint, i think we all agree it's unrealistic. i just don't expect to see it change, because then they'd have to rebalance everything from scratch."
3/29/2009,"deep space probes are still useful for quickly canvasing very large systems for exploration sites. if you want to visit any of those sites you can easily switch to exploration probes and get to work. just because the deep space probes are no longer the be all end all of scanning doesn't mean they are ""useless"".it was a good nerf."
3/29/2009,"a) only using four probes ensures that scanning is about placement, not ****ting out as many probes as you can and throwing them around a hit. i like the lack of clutter, thank you. it's hard enough to see what's going on with four overlapping probes, nevermind 8.b) what you're proposing is basically making scanning easier. it's already easy to scan down stuff. if you were to double the scan strength of dsps, allowing you to scan down sites even faster, then you'd need to make all signals harder to find. you'd either just raise the skill cap to explore with any decent measure of success, or make exploration once you hit astrometrics v incredibly easy."
3/29/2009,"i can support what the other delegates in the csm with me have said. i would also like to point out that it makes no sense that the developers would sacrifice the game they know and love for the epeen of saying ""i have 3 trillion dollars"". ccp is a business, and as such, it runs by rules to ensure the game continues to move smoothly."
3/29/2009,"it is a good thing that ccp employees play the game, because it is the best (and only) way to ensure that they know what the game is all about.it is a good thing that they do so on the live server, because the test server is not a true representation of the actual game environment, since it follows a lot of different rules.it is logical that they make isk for their characters somehow.it is also logical that they do so based on what they know, as long as that does not include using exploits. they can't avoid knowing things, after all. you don't expect them to drug themselves thick and dozy every time they play, right?you have to trust in ccp, ccp's internal watchdogs and the csm to keep a watchful eye on this. if you don't, it makes no difference anyway, because if ccp actively tried to smash the game, they'd succeed with or without your trust, with or without controls. even if it just meant to go bozo on the server blades with a fire axe. that would be pretty dumb, though. after all, eve is their biz, not just their hobby."
3/29/2009,"im gonna believe they have rules for playing on tq , its a damn shame they arent public tho.im sure they woud never ruin the game they worked on so hard. however they might think its fun to get rich and wage wars on tq. if even the ia team thinks its fun for them to wage wars we got a problem as it can get pretty unbalanced to fight someone with near unlimited isk.im into pvp a lott but i dont like putting a lott of effort/time into beating a enemy that has unlimited resources, it is why when the t20 thing got out i started to put very little serious effort into eve(changed from a 10 hours a day pvper believing everyone can be defeated to a pvper that plays a few hours a day casualy) as the person ur fighting might be one these ccp guys.question is , is it fun/allowed for them to wage/organise wars or not?and from what you have seen are they into that stuff on tq? or is that nda aswell.."
3/29/2009,you do realise that this forum is for the bringing of ideas to the attention of the csm and not ccp internal affairs right.....?damn you fail....
3/29/2009,well. done.
3/29/2009,"are you a shareholder or something? ccp is a privately owned company. so no, they didn't make the game for you. they made the game for themselves and released it to the public in order to create profit. that they even listen to people in order to improve the game and thus their profits, you should be thankfull for."
3/29/2009,"cripes. another mm loser that believes all the propaganda his leaders spew out.get it through your tin-foil covered head, ccp is not out to get everyone and there is not a great ccp conspiracy on tq. most ccp employees have no idea how the market is going to react to changes just like the rest of us. any sort of blatant market manipulation based on insider info would be easily caught by ia."
3/29/2009,am i allowed to bump?
3/29/2009,"you're under the impression here that concord is new eden's police force. it's not. it's the carebear defence league - if you shoot a bear(one that isn't stupid enough to re-flip a can or similar, at least), concord comes to smack you around. it's not supposed to be balanced, it's not supposed to be fair, it's supposed to be a deterrent backed up by the banhammer, such that the bulk of eve's user base can play the game in relative peace. and that will never, ever change. get used to it."
3/29/2009,good god no.
3/29/2009,"i value pew pew as much as anybody in this game and maybe more, but i still groan every time i see i ""get rid of concord"" thread. i realize this is not precisely what you're proposing, but the bottom line is concord exists for a very important purpose. just because you need to get your pew pew fix doesn't mean we should be able to evade concord. if you part non-consenting, under prepared riff raff from their ships, just go to w-space."
3/29/2009,ccp makes industry a full-time training job. someone who really wants to explore the industry side cannot train the skills to keep up with a pirate. you want to remove their protection just so you can have easier access to easy targets.you wouldn't happen to own a van that likes to sit outside elementary schools do you?
3/29/2009,"i remember a long time a go it was possible to outrun concorde (specially when ur mine exploded in 0.0 whilst you were out and about)however it was decided that breaking concorde rules was punishable by a ship loss and it has become a exploit if this was somehow advoided,i fully agree with the current mechanics and do not support the op"
3/29/2009,hell no
3/29/2009,itt: op doesn't grasp the concept of concord's wtfpwn setup.how about concord pods and can nullify your clone contract in empire corp stations?
3/29/2009,"not supporting this.high security space!!!! it is high security for a reason. namely the protection of law abiding citizens. those who break high sec laws get punished if caught, just like in real life.if you want pew pew, then stay in low sec/null sec or declare an empire war."

3/29/2009,"how old are you? try being constructive.edit: just checked your avatar ingame and you are an obvious troll, you have barely been playing five minutes and i doubt you have got any killmails from shooting mining lasers at roids.-----------------------------------------"
3/29/2009,"as i said at the start, the people that are against do not really offer any good reason as to why we have/need km's, if people really need to keep a record of what they do then why not just fraps it(as most people seem to do anyway)? if you want the enemy set-up then scan the ship, if you want stats then keep a diary. do any of you remember when ascn lost their titan? (the first titan ever made) did you need to see a km to know it had been popped? the answer to that is ""no"".-----------------------------------------------------"
3/29/2009,"actually, several good reasons have been given. 1) it makes sense in-game that people would look at the wreckage to see what exactly they killed.2) it's a game, people like keeping score.3) the game should do that kind of monotonous record-keeping for you, not demand that you do it yourself. 4) tracking corpmate performance, to help you improve their play. 5) tracking corporate performance for the purposes of creating a clear and unambiguous combat record, which can then be used to(e.g.) advertise mercenary services. 6) there's no good reason to remove them, it's fine, l2p. also, i know i don't use fraps - doesn't it utterly ream your system performance? my computer isn't exactly the fastest machine on the market, it can't handle another high-need program while eve's running. besides, expecting players to be forced to use third-party tools when the first-party tool already exists is silly."
3/29/2009,"/signed for the counter-argumentcloaking is a balanced mechanic as it exists in the game. you can't find them, but they can't harm you. and if they try to harm you, they're doomed. the exception of course, being stealth-role ships, since that is their purpose, to hide and lie in wait and ambush. but compared to similar ships, they're still weaker combat-wise.yes, cloaked ships are impossible to scan down. the cloaking device bends all electromagnetic radiation around it seamlessly, rendering it invisible to any form of detection. while it is cloaked, its sensors are offline as well, so it is not emitting anything that a probe would pick up on since it is far too small to register passively on magnetometric and gravimetric sensors."
3/29/2009,"i was watching the video of revelations and in the background of space you can see thousands of stars in a narrow band, seperate from the basic background stars, all around you. these are the stars that we can travel to in game and that we see when we open ""map"". it depicts the stars all around us and its so neat.however after revelations, ccp no longer has the ""map"" stars visible in the background, just the basic background stars are visible. i am wondering if they can put them back into the game because seeing the stars in the background as you play helps with immersion i think. i wonder if they removed them from view because they created lag? or why don't they have them visible in the background anymore?can we get them back visible again? maybe even add in the thousands of stars we can go to via wormholes too, that would be neat to see as you look around your ship in space"
3/29/2009,"to me it sounds way more logical if all the ceos had to vote for some important decisions such as;disbanding allianceinviting/kicking a corporation.hell what about simple introducing ""shares"" of a sort this way the guy who started the alliance can decide if he likes a vote system or not."
3/29/2009,"i'm for the pvp community, i hope to represent them at best of my efforts :-)"
3/29/2009,"sounds wonderful, but what specifically are you in favor of?"
3/29/2009,"frankly, i would not feel comfortable with small gang pvp in your hands."
3/29/2009,"thanks for asking gothar. there are a number of ideas that i personally like include looking at group dispersal weapons both modifying the existing ones (i.e. smartbombs and launched bombs) to make them more use able and the creation of new types such as chaining weapons. one of the key areas though that i feel could benefit the small gang pvp group would be an in game record of intelligence gathering allowing the fc to better track what is going on outside of his own vision. i would like this to be integrated into the map so a commander could at a glance see the disposition of potential enemy forces assuming he has scouts in the area. obviously this would benefit large scale pvp as well but i think the effect it would have on small gang pvp would be extremely beneficial. obviously this wouldn't replace the old tested methods of voice-comms and a pen and paper but it would supplement it. the long outstanding issue of transferable kill rights, if implemented, would also help to increase the opportunities for solo pvp and am very much in favour of this issue and would hope to be able to raise it again with ccp. i feel the concept of ""bounty hunter"" sub-career would not only fit right in with the feel of eve but would open up exciting opportunities to those who like to spend time gather intel and finally strike at the moment they think is right. the issue surrounding it that would be problematic in my eyes would be the old clunking bounty system which at the same time would need an overhaul. beyond these areas i think that factional warfare could do with a change to decrease the benefit of large numbers of people in a single plex capturing it although that ideas isn't fully formed in my mind how it would work and therefore i can't go into much detail right now. these are just the ideas that have captured my imagination so far that have been bought up by various people of course and if a proposal is put up in the assembly hall that would benefit the area of solo and small gang pvp it would get careful consideration from me if i were to be on the csm. well thanks for the input anyway sak. please feel free to give your reasons so the other people reading this can be aware of your concerns and better come to their own decision."
3/29/2009,i like your ideas and may vote on you. good luck in the election./erem
3/29/2009,"heartstone, bunyip,thank you for closely reading my op, and let me give you a few thoughts regarding the two topics you were touchingsandbox and factional epic warfareour positions are very much related, heartstone, and i can see where you are coming from; jade's plea for more pilot-storyline interaction is among the most captivating i've ever read. and using fw as one possible vehicle to flatten individual (and erratic) influence onto possible storyline branches is quite clever. still, as we stand today, the sandbox is too imaginative, factually decoupled from the game's foundation (i.e. the plot; anyone still remember why we have fw? it's war, stupid!), and isk is the least original incentive for player activity.on the other hand, sandbox and storyline impact present two economic challenges to ccp : how to balance gooning, which threatens effectivity of investments, and how to offer content with as little man power as possible ? one part of the solution, and very much web 2.0 in that regard, is to let the players create content. and the second is to give them choices - not too many choices, for man power reasons - and make sure the choices depend on many pilots rather than one. that is why i advocate two ideas as my very own agenda :- tradable kill rights- programmable npcsthe former might one day replace concord, and the latter i see as a major milestone to boost the sandbox into a new dimension : it will bear a sister to the player-driven economy, which is the player-driven mission system, it will link wis to space, and it comes for almost free for ccp.we should cooperate, heartstone, and make sure that ccp shift their focus accordingly.a party is a party is a partyand then again, bunyip : it is not. look at it as a mechanism to make the communication pilots -> ccp more efficient. i'll give you three examples:issues are not always risen by posting on the forum, let alone the ""right"" forum, which is the assembly hall. the mass of pilots is using their network of friends to communicate and exchange. that is where the idea of our party network kicks in : having a csm's ear everywhere. thus, many good ideas will not only be discussed on an alliance's forum, but also picked up from the perspective of a council's member, who knows, how to work with the issue until is gets presented to ccp.secondly, the csm has rules which are written, and then there is the unwritten governance regarding communication within and to ccp. having the party as mechanism to assure forwarding of experiences from ankhesentapemkah to me will bring continuity into the discussion between csm and ccp. not so much in terms of eva's personal favourite issues to be continued, but knowing how to deal with people. that will allow me to start at full speed and give both csm and ccp a predictable (read: reliable) team player. in the end, this is to the benefit of pilots, who will turn to me to have their ideas represented.thirdly, and just mentioned, as a pilot, you will want to find someone to get your ideas through to ccp. nothing more teadious than now having to convince the csm first, before ccp reads your idea. take care has a clear identity, in addition to the above said professional yet less tangible aspects :- small industry / gangs- roleplay- balanceif you as a pilot, have an idea in this area, take care will be your addressee and your voice to ccp."
3/29/2009,"introductionmy name is weazy and im running for the csm. i thought about doing this the last two times, and basically assumed that the people who would run would be representing the majority of eve online players. however, through following the progress made by the last two councils, i would be neglecting my responsibilities as a player if i did not run. the bickering, pointless arguing, and general neglect of the playerbase has led me to believe that the people who have been in csm have done a poor job making any noticeable progress.bio/platformfirst and foremost, i am a pvper. i dont mine, i dont rat, i dont plex, and i dont build. my only occupation is 0.0 combat, both small gang and pos seizing. i am under the impression that eve was designed to be a combat environment with a secondary emphasis on everything else. i currently fc for the dara cothrom alliance in cloud ring, where i run ops daily in all combat situations (defense, roams, pos seizing, and gatecamping.) i am not a pirate, i do not grief new players, but i spend my time in eve as a human wrecking ball. over the last few months, i have observed the shifts in pvp tactics from an fc and combat perspective, and think i can provide ccp with valuable insight as to how combat in 0.0 works and can be improved. im not signing up to run because i hate falcons or think amarr is overpowered, im running to represent the so far neglected voice of combat pilots who have always adapted to flavor of the month combat and will continue to kill because thats why we play the game. i have been playing eve since 07/07 and run three accounts, with my two mains at around 30m sp each. i have been a member of many 0.0 and high sec corps and alliances including bruce, daco, pure., and others. i have experience as well with high sec mission running,t1 and t2 production/invention/research and am well versed in the carebear arts, but i have enough isk so i dont need to manufacture any more. my toons encompass all four races so i am not partial to any in particular. i have led fleets to all ends of the universe, and my favorite type of op is (of course) the small gang roam.real life infoim a 23 year old student living in the southern united states. i attend university with studies in a broad range of topics, ranging from history to computer science. summaryif you vote for me, you will be voting for someone who really enjoys combat and will work with ccp to make it as fun as possible. i have many ideas to bring to the table, and know i can make a contribution to the combat side of eve.a vote for weazy is a vote for pew."

3/29/2009,"hello all,my effort in the campaign as a csm will be focused on pvp. let me introduce myself, my friends call me leo or ruri, i am 24 and study business management at university, currently in my final year, i hope to set up my own wine import-export business soon, when i'm not out or studying you'll probably find me online on eve!many players love this game because it offers the most fun pvp out there in the mmorpg selection out there, my focus will be directed to interfacing with the pvp focused community and to make that voice heard.arguments that will be discussed with the community will be matters such as:the current sovereignty system, how can we make more fun and less boredom war.low sec loss of sec status rebalanced (make low sec engagements less demanding but keep empire safe(ish) without limiting access to someone just because he popped a couple of ships).revise the bounty system to make a bounty hunter profession viable where assassination contracts are handed out between players, player/corp ""a"" hires player/corp ""b"" to kill player ""c"", no point in assigning me a bounty so that i can pod myself in my clone with no implants to collect the bounty. maybe the contract could specify variables such as: if ship kill or pod kill required, maybe if ship what class(frig,bc,bs, capital etc.),wreck ownership (if you kill something and a third party steals it flags the thief to both wreck (ex) owner and aggressor.avoid corp hopping schemes, make it so that if someone joins a corp he cannot un join for a period of time (3-5 days?)work and talk with community and devs to find a way to let players that in the sandbox choose a purist pvp a way to survive, purist missioners make loads of money, purist miners also, a pure pvp char will have many more costs but substantially less rewards, this needs to be rebalanced, also links in the next point of t2 efficiency over price vs insurable t1, what point is there in having many solutions and many ships when they are not viable?work with ccp to find a way to give small hac/recon gangs a game play more enjoyable, maybe not bring ""nanos"" back but find a way that gives small groups more choice of mobility in engagement/disengagement. what i would like to express in this point is the difficulty of groups of skilled players to be effective, a 50 mil sp char on a hac/recon vs a 12 mil sp char on an insurable bs should take in account not only the sp count but also the cost of utilizing a 250 mil un insurable hac/recon or a insurable bs.also a discussion on the ""surrender war"" option, to make it so an official ""contract"" is accepted by the ceos of the two corps, where an item exchange section is displayed and a ""safe time"" in days is displayed so that the cessation of the war is mutually agreed by both parties. the winners take the agreed cash/assets and concord can sanction the contract by saying that for x amount of agreed days the winning party cannot declare war again before the end of the agreed contract.i hope i can do my best for my brother (and enemy) pvpers so that we can all stay in this fun place and keep enjoying it!!please send me feedback and talk with me, my voice is yours to use!!!leonardo d'alessandro - ruri dant"
3/29/2009,"question: in what way do you see the establishment of a political party as having any effect in a non-binding advisory body such as the csm.you've indicated that you put some thought into doing this and i'm wondering how this will actually matter. what are you thoughts madam?edit: apologies, didn't see the party post before putting question here. if you like you can direct your response there."
3/29/2009,"i looked and i don't think that the party referenced was anywhere close to succeeding in gaining support. the fact i had to have someone point me at a thread outside the forums that were used for promoting candidates indicated to me that the party was not viable in the form it exists now.as to the stated vision of the ""take care"" party, i believe that the party should decide if they need to ""reinvent"" the wheel. the ""voice of reason"" party has no interest in ""keeping a fire burning"". we seek to assure the freedoms we believe are essential to our members within the basic tenants of eve that risk and reward are directly related and that the pilots of eve have the right to choose the degree of risk they will most enjoy. that when the risks of eve are all compared that there remain a logical relationship to the rewards.we are ""conservative"" in that we believe that the fundamental principles of the risk/reward framework must be maintained. we are however a party that embraces changes that maintain the balance but add new and interesting elements to our lives in space.i have announced my commitment to the ""voice of reason"" party in a separate thread.best of luck to all candidates and any political affiliations they happen to represent in the upcoming election of the csm iii.issler dainzefounder of the ""voice of reason"" party"
3/29/2009,"thisi vote on individuals, not party's. a csm-candidate can be a bear and have good ideas that improve eve for everyone without tilting the game the game to much in a certain direction that will alienate other players with their preferable game style. however i'm 100% certain that you, issler, are not that person that i can trust with such things.andas for the name, i'm sure you thought you were clever when you come up with that for your party, but for me that is just a big warning sign. it reminds me of small, often extreme, local parties who desperately tries to get their ideas heard but no sane individual takes seriously and gets hardly any votes on election day. no doubt you will get all your friends in honda accord to vote you in a second time, but i hope more reasonable people look elsewhere.but at least the name tickled my funny-bone for a second./eremedit: fixed some typosedit: fixed more typos"
3/29/2009,"we can pretend all we like but there's not a whole lot of leeway between ""carebearism"" and ""wanting to lick carebear tears.""it's a 0/1 toggle.representing ""being left alone"" as a blow to ""pirates rights"" is a bit of a sham isn't it. either one person gets to be the sad panda, or the other."
3/29/2009,"for reference my position on this issue is as follows: there is no place in the csm for political parties. the csm is meant to represent the eve community as a whole and not just a select group of people. whilst personal focus of individual candidates may influence where they put their vote and what subjects they cover due consideration must be given to all topics by all csm members with as little bias as possible. the idea of voting blocs, parties and vote trading seems to me to smack of corruption. to quote james madison ""the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties ..."" (james madison the federalist #10 thursday, november 22, 1787)[edit for spelling]"
3/29/2009,"of course there is a place for parties : how can the pilots, those who vote, be sure that an individual candidate will represent their vision, as he might claim to do ? except the faint incentive to be re-elected one time for a voluntary job, there is only his bio and his network, which define him.in addition to that, most of us show their alliance / corporation in the posts. would you display them if you were not in favour of their position, and deem showing your affiliation to be helpful to your cause ? that is whya) i show my face to the voterb) i think players will appreciate a csm-themed affiliation (on top of any in-game reference)as for the 1787 reference of madison, i tend to answer pragmatically : would we have parties, if they did not do a good job ? cause on one hand parties are apparently well condensing people's opinion to an executable position. and on the other hand, they balance individual eccentricity to make sure the public good is not forgotten. my rough estimation : more harm was done by self-called ""people's representatives"" who did not have a stabilizing surrounding."
3/29/2009,"not at all, read the op. this isn't so much to make lowsec space harder to get into than to make it a more enticing and worthy challenge. as a mission runner i can certainly see this idea having legs and taking off.i also see this controlling the -10 population."

3/30/2009,"not a very big change but i would be good if on the orbit option in the overview we can have perhaps 3 defaults set so can change range fast while in combat rather than having too bring up the box and manually swap the orbit range. i.e, one can be set for close orbit, one outside of scram range and another at the gtfo range. as it is now if want to hold a gate in close before the jump got to swap to say 1k then keep remembering to change it to outside of scram range and tbh when in a drunken gang it does make for comedy deaths and missed tackles etc but even those wear thin after a while. so please give us a chance to pre-set a few more defult orbit ranges."

3/30/2009,"1) you haven't definite your ""less information"" before this post. 2) most of the posters suggest a range reduction in passive mode and that is the best way to make the scanner useless.3)i would very much want to see other things beside manned ships, for example probes, drones, maybe wrecks (it will give me an idea what the other guy is doing), cans (same reason as wrecks), unmanned ships if identified as such. the function of a scanner is to get an idea of what is happening, not simply to know ""there are 3 pings""."
3/30/2009,"oh yes, wouldn't make 0.0 as boring."
3/30/2009,"if you don't understand what we've said then just say so.1) what are you asking?2) read again- you misunderstand3) okas to your last part, it's the same interface. only actively scanning makes you more visable, thus the ""ping"" reference."
3/30/2009,"till the post 65 i cited no one has defined in any way what ""less information when auto scanning"" was. i don't agree that reducing them to only ""manned ship"" is a good idea, but at least it define a starting point.saying ""you haven't understood what what we are saying"" when you hadn't defined that vital point has no meaning. maybe you should read the posts again. suggestion so far:1) replace local with a pos add-on linked to sovereignty2) passive scan with reduced range3) no, we don't want a auto repeating scan good, having a starting point helped.the last part mean that getting only the ships (and pods hopefully) is getting ""there are x pings"" (targets, or however you want to call them).people need to know more informations to try to guess what they are doing. so if i lose local with his friend/not friend display i need to have more informations by the scanner to compensate. for example if i am in high sec and see:orcapod apod bpod cunmanned combat ship 1unmanned combat ship 2unmanned combat ship 3and then it change toorcamanned combat ship 1manned combat ship 2manned combat ship 3as a miner i can suspect i am in trouble even if i don't see that there are 3 red flashing guys in system. a useful feature to add to an active scanner if local is removed, is the detection of friendly transponders.i.e. i actively scan and send out a signal. all friendly (blue) pilots transponders reply and the relative ships are identified as allied, the others simply as not identified."
3/30/2009,seeing how the 2 post about reduce range when in passive mode are yours (-50% range and 3 au) can you care to explain how that will make the passive mode useful?
3/30/2009,this only works in wh space atm because there are a limited number of poss up without a bazillion ships foating in space plus most wh system i have encountered have been fairly small. in reality in proper 0.0 it just wont work.
3/30/2009,no
3/30/2009,"if you're not using the scanner, and it's just sitting there, exactly what would it matter, other than a quick glance?see, you want to have everything simple and easy, and handed to you. you want to get a full picture of the situation without any work. as you posted above, you want to know for sure based on scan results if some ships are manned or not, or what changes have taken place. hell, let's just make a huge system-wide map that shows everyone's position and what they're doing.no, a scanner should essentially say, ""x ship is roughly y au/km away and in z direction with n% accuracy.i've posted the interface will not change. but if this would be a local replacement, with the scanner constantly being on the main ui, then unless hunting for someone actively then reduce the range and add some mystery. stop wanting to play the game on easy mode."
3/30/2009,"because there is people like you that want to get a ""easy ganker"" mode.3 au passive range is laughable. it will not detect any probe (but then probably you don't want probes detected), it will detect a ship that is already warping to your position and only a pair of seconds before it drop on you. coupled with a refresh cycle of some seconds it mean it will miss a ship warping to you at least 75% of the time.that mean that passive scanning is totally useless. at that point we return to step one. mash the scan button every 2 seconds and kill the server and find the scanner made useless by lag. you don't want a replacement to the local system, you want what you dream is a ""get plenty of kills"" system.but the effect of a change like that would be exactly the same of the change of the probing system with kali.a pair of week of easy ganking of mission runners, then years of cries in forum ""where are all the low sec missionrunenrs, force them to run in low sec, we don't have target"".you will not get more easy pickings, you will simply increase the number of empty systems and cloaked ships.maybe you think that cloak on line will be a beautiful game, i think it will be a total waste of bandwidth."
3/30/2009,"yep, i really rack up those kills... oh wait. you see, here's where people like you have a huge problem.you say, nope that won't work. so instead of finding a way to fix it here and there, you throw everything out.here's a thought. passive scan range 14 au, active is 25 au.suddenly nothing changes, except we get an auto scanner that broadcasts the location.local does nothing to prevent anyone from getting ganked. oh wait, that's unless you use it as a batsignal when to run, hide, and log out.because when you run to station you can't do anything. you can't scan where he/she is. for all you know they're cloaked and afk.local does absolutely nothing right now but give a false sense of security. enhance scanning, by benefiting those that want to be found and those that don't.make it so stealth has a purpose.make it so hunting down people takes work.make it so there's no insta-broadcast of who's in space.make it so alliances can't take 100 systems with 30 people.make it so 0.0 industrialists have to actually be cautious, instead of parking a scout 2 jumps up.it's a joke, and i'm an industrialist."
3/30/2009,signed.local shouldn't show you in any systems if your not talking.
3/30/2009,"learn to read. i clearly show how item duplication and ownership of dropped loot cannot always be distinguished due to alts and trading and market/contracts. report me all you want, throw a tantrum, whine and holler, no one cares.under your idea, which you have changed from getting all items back to getting isk value back (and who determines the amount of isk to be given back, hmmm?)i'll go very slowly and hopefully you'll actually engage brain this time:1) you get popped to a bug, faction module drops2) your un-affiliated alt picks up faction module3) you get back your ship + all modules via petition4) your alt also gets isk since ccp refunded the items it took away from your alt that looted all the modules.get it?"
3/30/2009,"signet sooooooooo much signet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!this policy is more then just rediculess!.since you only get your ship back if it was killed due to a bug, i don't see how they can let people be rewarded by using the bug which is actually exploiting, this is so rediculess and should be fixed immidiately!.signed signed signed aaaaand signet :p"
3/30/2009,"you have records of everything in eve, it is just to ran everything back module wise.meaning if you got a module due to a bug, it will be removed and you will rescieve a eve mail where it states that it was a bug and therefore was removed and if it was done on purpose it would have been a exploit and therefore banneble, so people complaining clearly know it is a bug and therefore wish to exploit (well shouldn't need to say more"
3/30/2009,"im torn on this issue as well.unless ccp can find that the items have not changed hands, fitting to a ship, refined, or jetision i would say yes... give the mods back.but the problem goes back to the ""logs show nothing"" and trying to track those items let alone the chance that someone doesnt try to quick sell the mod for isk... or fit it to their shiney ship.i think it could leave room open for abuse, and cause more problems then it solves.the hp bug is something i hadn't heard of before, but its just that a bug... and its good you got some reimbuirsed.i support you in ideal, but in the current dev/player relationship through petitions, the time it takes usually to resolve reimbuirsment... its not fesible to implement, imo anyways."
3/30/2009,"i'm with ignit on this one as well. it's sort of like the legal principle that the will not disgorge an unknowning purchaser of stolen merchandise. i do believe certain exceptions should apply, such as the wreck being popped before being looted. but i'd be curious as to how you'd redress this problem 'creating' items or removing them from people who through no fault of their own came into possession of them before i'd give my full support."
3/30/2009,"the problem with this is that it starts to throw the rarity of a lot of mods into question. wait, dark, weren't you the raison d'etre for the speed nerf in you 18 km/s vaga? oh screw you not supported!"
3/30/2009,"yet again i ask you to read my post and if you have a look at the bottom i havent changed my mind on anything, i said market average value in isk is a possible option. as to your exploit... what? so ok if it is a genuine bug then it would most likely be at random like all bugs are. so in your situation you would run the risk of blowing up your own expensive items and run the risk that a) you get it back and b) the expensive modules are the ones that live. if ccp put a banning rule on this sort of behaviour i highly doubt anyone would try it because it would be incredibly difficult to do so plus bugs are very different to exploits... exploits are consistent bugs are random.all your posts are saying to me is that you have some kind of personal dislike for me or tri and you still have not fully read my opening post."
3/30/2009,"i think there are two possible fixes for this. either give the player isk back based on the average market price or perhaps impliment a new petition section giving it priority much like petitions filed under ""stuck"". say we call this new petition option ""bugged loss"" the player who has lost his ship or items petitions saying i beleive my loss was due to a bug etc etc. the gm then freezes the items or removes them from game temporarily and passes the petition on to the reimbursement department who can then do a full and normal investigation taking as much time as required for it. this minimizes the work load on ccp and doesnt **** a load of people off who have shifted, sold or used the modules themselves by having the items taken back. the petition response generally on a ""stuck"" enquiry for me has never been longer than an hour or so, no item can move very far in that time."
3/30/2009,"dark, i know you're smarter than this to not see how many horrifically myopic problems the bolded bits would bring in."
3/30/2009,its just a possible solution but i would be interested to see possible arguments. imagine also that ccp said abuse of this system would have punishment i doubt many people who arent drunk would do it.
3/30/2009,"we just need ccp to stop responding like robots and actually consider what happened, and as far as i know this bug still hasnt been fixed, i keep seeing it."
3/30/2009,gather the evidence and report it. i consider this to be a very serious issue - yet there's not enough evidence to show that it really does exist in a way suggested in this thread. a bug like that would be of critical importance to fixotherwise it's just rumors and excuses by people who lose stuff. where is the evidence?

3/30/2009,"i've no idea if it's the exact same bug, but you can see basically the hp bug happening in one of farjung's old vids [edit: wave of mutilation 11:10 in] from several years back where he two volleys a freighter's hull with a blasterthron. there's been quite a few reports of it just recently, so i don't think there's any doubt it's a real bug. that's not the point of the thread though...the reimbursement policy is horribly inconsistent, there's no debating that. you can submit the same request in identical circumstances and depending on the gm you get you either receive your ship back immediately or have to wade through lots of firm nos, an escalation or two and then quite possibly a yes.i have heard of a couple of cases of looted mods being reimbursed (or duped rather) unfortunately i can't cite concrete cases. i guess even with a no-dupe policy recreating the odd t2 mod seems insignificant to the gms. i don't know what the solution is. we used to have a set of implicit precedents like no looted mods reimbursed, no supercaps reimbursed, no ships from fleet battles reimbursed. all these policies were grossly unfair but at least they hit everyone in the same way.now they've all been broken, gms take every case on it's own merits. that should be the ideal policy but unfortunately they've proven several times now that they're just too prone to ballsing it up. they're obviously overworked and with eve being as complex as it is it's hard for them to hire enough knowledgeable people, but something is very wrong if they can't even consistently call the headline cases correctly.the specifics suggested here on what to do about dropped loot i can't support. there are too many corner cases. it may not be a big deal to try to reimburse several bil in low-end officer gear (fortunately isk isn't insta-win in eve) but there are a lot of items in eve that are so rare you just can't put a ""market value"" on them. if the gms can't even notice how long an alliance has existed before changing it's name how can we trust them to accurately determine the value of a t2 hac bpo looted in a bug. ideas to try to freeze loot associated with suspect losses is just unworkable in general.until we reach a situation where genuinely unbiased common-sense usually prevails in petitions i tend to think hard limits with no-exceptions on various reimbursement scenarios is the (unfortunate) way to go. never-the-less i'll support reimbursement policy being raised by the csm, not because it will lead to a silver-bullet solution but because it will remind the gms they have a lot of room for improvement, however hard that improvement will be.i know vuk campaigned on customer support in general (and probably will again) and has been very tough on the gms whenever he's gotten the chance but i'm not sure it's ever come up as an official csm issue. so here's a tick and let's hope it does.i'd also personally like to see more qa effort and attention paid to the kind of bugs that lead to these situations. there are some signs that's happening, but there's a ways to go yet."
3/30/2009,"nice post, and i have to be honest i have no quick fire genius way to fix it i've just given some small suggestions as to the kind of direction it could go. but this is about raising awareness to ccp that their reimbursement policy could as you say use some improvement. thanks for post."

3/30/2009,"well...because ccp saw fit to erase all your previous scan results on each new scan the problem becomes sorting through the clutter now. with core probes you have to narrow each one down, one at a time, to 100% so you can bookmark it. even if it is a site you do not want you need to go through this rigmarole so you can bookmark it to avoid probing the same site out on your next go to find whatever it is you are looking for.previously you still had to get some accuracy on it but did not need to pin everything to 100% to focus on something you wanted.and again...it is more about them being essentially the same as a core probe for usefulness. yes you can scan a bigger area with one probe but so what? you can get better hits with a few cores running a shorter range plopped to cover inner planets and remote planets. i think the guy above is wrong that sites can be anywhere. all scans i have run have all the sites within 4au of some stellar object. even if you use dsp you simply must revert to core anyway. so while not a big deal to call them back in and redeploy core why bother? not to mention this makes it worthless to train up to l5 on the skill."

3/30/2009,"there should be a easy way for filtering local from unwanted players based on their corp or alliance. currently you can only block a single characters which is avery ineffective way of making your life easier if you want to avoid entire groups of players, for example noob corp players/isk spamming bots or some alliances you just dont want to read. many messages in same time can increase lag, but long block list can give you simmilar effect."
3/30/2009,i'm supporting this
3/30/2009,"i'm sure there's probably a good reason for this, but i'll wait for the parade of people to emorage on me to explain why. the modules in question are sensor backup arrays and signal amplifiers. taking a look at signal amplifiers between their midslot counterparts it comes out to this:signal amplifier ii:targetting range +30%signature resolution +15%max targets +2no faction variantssensor booster ii:range +30%resolution +30%activation cost: 5 capscriptable to 60%/0faction variants------------------------------in this case shield tankers are already juggling their mids for other utility slots such as tackle and propulsion, not to mention the cpu advantage is generally lost on shield tanks given their high cpu amount. the lowslot variant is less than half as effective in resolution (important due to agility changes) and the only benefit you have is a passive module that is vastly outperformed and a bonus that doesn't work because of broken mechanics.now, onto sensor backup arrays and eccm: radar backup array ii:+48% sensor strength.passive18 cpuradar eccm ii:+96% sensor strength12 cap usage/10 secondsoverloadable to 124.8%in this case the module in question is once again half as effective for about 33% cpu savings, and minor cap usage. with overloading, it becomes about 1/3 as effective, and is detracting from propulsion/cap/damage modifiers/fitting utilities. in sum, these items (as well as tracking computers/tracking enhancers) need to be reviewed from a balance perspective, as it's already one more disincentive for shield tanking in pvp."
3/30/2009,"the most reasonable thing to do, without any radical changes, is to seed faction variants for mods that have none"
3/30/2009,now compare tracking enhancers to tracking computers. low slots are allot more valuable then high slots yes those 2 mods are weird.for the rest if you have atleast 3-4 mids then low > midslot
3/30/2009,"moar standings, options would be good."
3/30/2009,"from one who loves to fly under nrds policy, expand it please!! --isaac"
3/30/2009,"ok, first of all, im not trying to say that scamming should somehow be removed or bannable, if ppl are not wise enough to read contracts before excepting the terms, they deserve to be scammed.with that said my issue here is the blantant abuse of spamming of scam contracts in jita local. im sure i speak for many others in stating that the scammer spam in jita local chat impacts the legitamit players significantly.the solution i constantly here when ppl complain about this is simply ""block them"". well thats a fine idea, however you can only block so many ppl, and that really does not impact the potential buyers of the legit contracts, unless the potential buyers also block them. not to mention that there are only so many ppl you can block.a few ideas i have that are probobly not perfect but may help. i hope others chime in with ideas and the dev's take a serious look at this discussion.idea#1 drastically increase the amount of players that can be blocked, like to say unlimited!! (at least if only in jita)idea#2 there needs to be a time limit when posting with contracts linked. possibly 1-2 minute delays before posting another contract link (this wont affect chat). maybe not the best idea due to the fact that it will limit legit traders contract posting as well, however it will most certainly hurt the scammers more than legit traders i believe. it will also give ppl a chance to read the contracts and determine the fake ones vs the real ones, and the block the fake traders. idea#3 im out of ideas for now, you chime in on what you think may be a good solution"
3/30/2009,"i agree on idea #1, the others not so much."
3/30/2009,"just to clarify, the #2 idea about dealying posting with contracts is intended to be towards the same person posting multiple contracts one after another. although admitedly its not the greatest idea, just a thought."
3/30/2009,"and what is the problem with closing local when you enter jita and then re-opening it when you leave? unlimited block list would be nice, but if it is because of server performance limitations then i would rather have better performance.even if all the scammers and spammers were gone from jita local, jita local would still be completely stupid."
3/30/2009,"maybe a ""report spam"" system would be a good thing.. simply right click the name of the player ""add to spammer list"" and once every 5 minutes the system checks for people with more then 10 (25 or 50) reports and then mutes them for an hour as punishment. this could also be used in other places of course.. like yesterday in 49- the goons took it on themselfes to spam the hell out of local (for no appearant reason i might add) and it would be nice to be able to stop that without having to call for a gm.this doesn't prevent anyone from scamming but it would curb the pants-on-head ******ation that is currently jita local. it's like reading the viagra-spam mails all day... it's not like anyone falls for them (expect people that deserve it) it's just plain stupid and a waste of bandwidth/gm-time etc."
3/30/2009,asura starfield would be displeased
3/30/2009,"how about not allowing a contract to be posted more than say 50 times in a day? or maybe a total limit regardless of how long, like 100 max contract links."
3/30/2009,"dr. eyjog mentioned it at fanfest 2007, people have been asking for it before, others tried to make one themselves:an eve isk saving account / bank, that people can put their isk to and receive interests.the interest rate is supposed to be small, e.g. 0.5% per month or lower, so that player driven eve banks and other forms of investments can compete.the isk can be locked for a certain period of time.also the interest payment can be done on a daily basis, where people have to login and push a ""collect interest"" button, so that they receive the daily interest, otherwise the interest for that day expires. this way there won't be an uncontrolled growth of isk on inactive accounts. it would also motivate people to log in. the idea, that money generates more money without that the owner of the money has to do something is not new. interests are common in any economy system, receiving interest for money occurred even thousands years ago on earth (even mentioned in the bible), a realistic financial system (that eve is supposed to be) shouldn't lack it."
3/30/2009,and why don't you just put your money in the player driven eve banks?
3/30/2009,"eve's financial system doesn't lack it. put your money in a player bank, or a bpo, or a better mission ship, or... it's not that i'm opposed to this, i just don't see the point."
3/30/2009,this.
3/30/2009,"because i don't like to lose all my isk in the ""next big eve online scam"".banking requires trust and security. this naturally doesn't exist in eve: the bank owners can simply not pay back your isk, that's legitimate gameplay, no scam, and you couldn't do anything against it.in real life bank deposits are secured in many ways, the prohibition of scam for example, and finally through government guarantees. in eve there is nothing alike, it's a big invitation to pull a scam. player made content doesn't work properly in that trust-/security based system. i'd love to see a secured banking system."
3/30/2009,then this sounds like the issue you should be proposing be fixed. not creating a system separate from the one that already exists.
3/30/2009,evading concord is actually very easy.you just don't go into systems where they patrol.problem solved.
3/30/2009,"absotively posilutely not, and this is exactly why: carebears rely on the rule of law to run the supply side of eve's economy, because by and large they can't rely on themselves, especially when they're working in space in ships fitted for industrial tasks."
3/30/2009,yes. while in it i keep a sniper rifle handy and practise satanic rituals. i also think concord should be more easily defeated but changed so they are more like sleepers (this info is the worst of them all...shudder).
3/30/2009,"you are still operating under the mistaken delusion that concord can be defeated.i believe it's actually been said somewhere else by one of the ccp folks that if you can figure out how to beat concord, it's an exploit and bannable.besides, i already told you how to avoid them. what more do you want?"
3/30/2009,"ok, on a corp shopping trip to jita, loaded a hauler with 600mills of mods and rigs and bpo`s , at a jump gate in jita which is 0.9 sec , lag and high player count meant locked down gate , i was on auto pilot waiting at gate, serious lagg , next thing i know i was in a capsule ? wtf ??? wreck looted.checked loss mail, popped by a large smart bomb from an abbaddon battle ship piloted by a -10 sec rated player , my hull, armour and sheilds amounted to approx 2,500 hp`s yet kill mail showed i was popped with only 299 damage ? the mail smelt to me rotten and not quite right.ccp quoted as saying to me gm reply removed. navigatorcan someone please explain to me how this was possible ? how did the -10 sec player avoid concord and was able to operate in 0.9 sec space freely ? why did my loss mail only show 299 damage and 1 person involved yet my ship should have taken 2,500 plus hps ?i am at a loss to understand this .despite me also having to explain to my corp, ooops sorry guys lost the shopping !any ideas?"
3/30/2009,"so, you were on auto pilot in a little hauler, carrying over half a billion of cargo?wrong forum, and the loss is your fault. -10 are punished for being in hi sec, but they are not prevented."
3/30/2009,"a) wrong forumb) do not post communications with gms.c) being -10 just means the faction navy/police will chase him. not concord. it is possible to fight them off or tank them. given he was using smartbombs he likely was expecting to be target jammed by the faction navy/police. being in an abaddon he probably had a hellacious tank, sucked up the damage and decided to instapop whatever he could at a crowded gate where everyone is locked out.d) seriously bad move toting around $600 mil in a mere hauler. at the least a tanked to hell-and-back (plates/extenders) transport. preferably a freighter. you are asking for trouble with that much loot in a hauler.e) no idea why km was odd. maybe lag...dunno."
3/30/2009,/lock threadwrong forum. you chose to afk pilot a hauler with 600mil isk of mods (stupid stupid idea btw) and then cry about it. get a t2 hauler/freighter and pilot the dang thing. send this to c&p.--isaac
3/30/2009,"supported, as a non-smoker. don't we play immersive games to do what we can't irl?also, if there's rating issues, label it a healthy thing. air-borne medication of regenerative nanobots leaving a smoky residu trail!"
3/30/2009,"do we really need it? my employment history is long as it is, mainly due to me being a bad choice in player corporations.i would like it as some sort of option. as much as i would love to cut some player corps from that list i know that wont change"
3/30/2009,not supported.any (intelligent) corporation that considers you an as applicant is going to want to see those changes.
3/30/2009,"unless you're booted from your corp unknowingly, you never need to see a npc corp - you don't need to drop corp to switch. if you have a pile of npc corps in your history, that says that either you don't understand game mechanics too well or that you got booted from your corps, both of which a potential recruiter wants to know. beside, the gaps would say just as much as the npc corp entries do, it'd just mean that people would have to examine the start/end dates on every corp swap. also, you'd lose the ability to check character creation dates. not supported."
3/30/2009,heh.. i'd settle for timely updates on what ccp is thinking about fixing... then we'd know exactly what their priorities are.
3/30/2009,"enough talk, do it ccp."
3/30/2009,"boy wants mails done away with cause it an e-peen stroker, then trying to flame a new player for not killing enough people, thus flashing his e-peen around for all that cares (none btw). careful nebie, too much e-peen stroking makes a mess !"
3/30/2009,with my corp we made some test:a covert jump-fleet of black ops consume isotope....ok .we measure the consumption of diffrerent ship for a jump of 4ly :manticore : 258 isotopepilgrim : 3218 isotoperapier : 2725 isotoperedemeer : 845 isotopethe cargohold of the black ops being 600m3 of 4000 and may contain isotope .....consumption of covert jump-fleet was modeled on the fleet of jump-fleet of the titan ..... but the hold or consumption is a big problem ....i am not in favor of increasing the hold of the black ops to prevent abuse of all kinds .... but reduce the consumption of ship is a good solution
3/30/2009,they already implemented a supplement to this and that is with the blockade runner ship. it was designed to be able to use the jump portal as well so it could carry fuel and supplies for the fleet.
3/30/2009,"i support this.other mmo's dont' require years of trainining to make 1 character proficient in an area.doubt it will every happen, because ccp would lose a cash cow"
3/30/2009,"neither does eve. unless of course you define proficient as ""super omgwtf pwnage army of one""."
3/30/2009,ditto with one slight difference.. you can only create one personality per account but have the other slots available should you buy another.
3/30/2009,no.
3/30/2009,"you have nothing new to add to the discussion. you have not read or understood what we are trying to say.. you are just copy/pasting from other cloak related issues and think you have come up with a smart reply. what you are adressing is not, i repeat, is not the issue here. please read again, think, think some more, use your imagination to understand what the op is actually saying. then reply."
3/30/2009,"cloak is called cloak for a reason. works as intended, no issue here. macro miners are a problem which every mmo has. changing a game mechanic to aim at macro miners will aim at legit players in general aswell. we just have to live with macro miners or, better, hunt them down (yes, it is possible).sorry, no easy free carebear kills for you."
3/30/2009,"ah! i see now. it's an arguement so strong and so pursuasive that facts have nothing to do with it... only our imaginations can unlock the wisdom of this idea. i'll try hard to imagine a world where this is a good idea, i really will!"
3/30/2009,oops sorry i forgot to put [proposal]
3/30/2009,"candidacy postno website yet, will update when i throw one together."
3/30/2009,"i think ccp has done a very good job making 0.0 interesting by allowing the player base to make it what it currently is. however, i think that there needs to be more adjustment to make it more tempting for players to come out and enjoy it. one of the major problems i think eve has is the divide between the players in high sec and the players in unsecured space. one could go his entire eve career, become exceptionally rich, and never enter 0.0 if he did not want to. there needs to be more incentive for people to leave the comfort of high sec for better riches and more reward.also, i think pos sov mechanics need to be reworked to make it a bit more interesting. shooting down posses that are un-manned is about the most boring and tedious parts of the game. i would like the regular pos ai to be reworked so an un-manned pos is harder to kill, and also would like to see poses take a more backseat role in regards to sovereignty. one of the things that makes the game un-fun for 0.0 inhabitants is the fact that we have to deal with posses all the time (filling, anchoring, transporting, emptying) and have people in our alliances who do only that. if we could remove some dependence on poses for sov, everyone would be happy i assume."
3/30/2009,"ruri,i represent a different group of folks in eve and am running myself so i wouldn't be voting for you and i would be encouraging folks to vote for members of ""the voice of reson"" party. that said i hope you will run. you definitely have been committed to an important part of the eve experience. the eve csm is only better the more diverse we can become. i hope you give it a shot.good luck!issler"
3/30/2009,i am hoping that the formation of a party will increase the visibility of the csm. i also believe that while i have some ideas about what makes sense for the folks i will (or whoever the party ultimately supports) represent adding additional channels of communications and opportunities for participation will improve the input for this constituency into the csm.this is very much an experiment. i was partly inspired to take this course after some conversations with folks in ccp about this interesting venture into virtual world politics.i am excited to see how this unfolds. so i'd love to continue hear what folks think.issler
3/30/2009,"i've gotten commitments from 8 of the csm canidates for interviews, and hope to see commitments from more in the near future. i plan to post the interviews on my blog.that said, here's a link to my lead post on the subject. it also contains an index of all my interviews..if you've specific questions you'd like to see asked, just go there and leave a comment. i'll update here as this progresses. expect the completed interviews by the 20th of april."
3/30/2009,"i appreciate the time you took to respond to my post erik and i respect your position. in fact in many ways i agree with a lot that you are saying but don't personally see the need to bring in another layer of titles and names to be able to achieve it. let me briefly address some of your points from my personal perspective so you , and others may see where i am coming from whether you agree with me or not. i believe one of the essential things for a csm to be able to do is look an issue brought before the csm with as little bias as possible. to say you ascribe to one vision or another limits your options in certain circumstances if you hold to it in every case. yes there are areas in which i have opinions and thoughts for myself but i think it would be remiss of me not to consider counter arguments against those ideas for the good of the whole community. i can think of a number of ideas that would be of great benefit to solo/group pvp that would negatively impact the industrial sector for example but wouldn't vote for them precisely because of this negative impact to a large portion of the player group. in this instance i am not talking for my alliance. i am not here to represent the views of the star fraction on certain issues. i am not even here to represent the views of the roleplay community or the pvp community. i was actually considering creating a ""blank"" character to run on who had no affiliations but thought in the end that such a character would be ignored so simply went with my main character. personally i think this is a tautological argument. we have parties, in my opinion, because they are, to an extent, political easy mode. i see a certain value in them in real world politics but can't really see the need for them here. i agree that parties can be a stabilising influence certainly but the stabilisation they are shifted to more often than not seems to be towards the benefit of the party than the public that voted for them in the first instance. in the case of the csm i certainly don't doubt that the public good would be forgotten by anyone who wished to run as a party member my concern is with the implication rather than the current reality. at the end of the day though i certainly won't be railing against those that are members of parties or those that wish to represent one cause over another. i respect your position and wish you luck with it. it's just not for me."

3/31/2009,"nice idea, especially with hot keys."
3/31/2009,"i posted a thread months back about orbits and hotkeys, and especially how baffling it is to see hotkeys for certain functions like lock target, but nothing else like the various movement commands. it hardly received any notice, but no matter, this one fits the bill nicely. give us something that should've been present in the game ages ago, ccp."
3/31/2009,supported.
3/31/2009,very much a good idea
3/31/2009,"this was on the wrong page, saying that, the 3rd csm should bring this to ccp, we will see if they fair better the our current csm..."
3/31/2009,what this guy said.so no.
3/31/2009,"the were the one suggesting 3 au or in alternative to cut range by 50%.passive at 14 au is functional, 3 not. scanner don't broadcast the location. it give number of presences in range. and there are those like you that offer one sided solutions and then get all offended when people shot them down. you want it changed, your job is to offer functional solution, i don't see much reasons to change, my job is to shot down unworkable solutions.i have suggested some idea, you fell they are overpowered and shot them down, good, you are doing your part of the job, but don't pretend that your suggestion have no flaws. all your argument have a value if you offer a a workable solution, but most of your suggestion so far have been about removing a strong intelligence tool and giving in exchange a tool suffering from myopia."
3/31/2009,space is too small with local blaring your presence.i support this as it would make small roaming gangs more valid.and extend it to fw space too for extra fun.(directional)scanners need work though.
3/31/2009,"it's a change proposal. if you actively scan, it shows even on the passive scanner within the maximum range. so if you're looking for someone, you can be seen also. of course this doesn't work for cloaked, so instead i had a thought last night, with ""ghost"" images, random blips or such. this would need more thought as to houw it's implemented. but i do agree, removing local without making it possible to detect that someone might be cloaked nearby is too overpowering for covops/recons/black ops believe me when i say i'm not offended, and also when i say my ideas have flaws- i even state several posts above that any ideas of mine have issues and need to be fleshed out a bit.i've spent a lot of time in wh space recently. i've been a ""nice guy"" there and one that's not so nice. i've harvested and hunted. with no local, and constandly looking at the scanner, i've had a blast.if you delay local in lowsec and 0.0, it won't change much- lowsec is about as populated as a wh system these days anyway.part of removing local though would be to also remove static belts. this would give your lookout (if you were on an op) to notify the fc if hostiles were nearby.and if you're really that worried with a few recons coming and disrupting the party, have a couple bss, intys, and hacs around. those recons will melt like butter."
3/31/2009,i'm so disturbed right now by how many people have 0.0 alliances in their name and support this.the reality is that 0.0 space would be forced into becoming capship stationgames far more then it already is. the system wouldnt be defendable. the only people left ratting or mining in 0.0 would be farmers.
3/31/2009,"lolwhy, becase you can't park an alt 2 jumps up the pipe to see if local pops?or because those super-alliances might find it's fairly difficult to defend that much unused space without an instant intel tool?no, there would be no farmers, as they wouldn't be able to run and log as soon as someone enters local."
3/31/2009,"you know, rp reasoning for this can be used either way.""this information is available to all ships within the sphere of influence of those gates hence jumping into system leads to your appearance in local.""can you explain why this has to be?"
3/31/2009,oh can you imagine how awful that would be. oh the horror! the horror!(disclaimer: would not really be horrible)
3/31/2009,speak for yourself.pro-tip: ratting can be done with other ships than lolfit ravens warping to belt-markers at 0km and staying stationary until the last rat is dead.
3/31/2009,you must tell me this secret of awesomeness!
3/31/2009,"really? i doubt it.just a thought, but a possible set up that will work for rattlers:- raven with extended probe launcher instead of cloak (sure, it will have cpu problems, they it will not be so hard for ratting);- drop a combat probe, max range, filter ship only- and smash the scan button forever- war to a safespot when the probe detect someone.boring as hell, but probably anyone working for a sweatshop would get a macro doing it for him and automatically recalling the drones and warping him when someone was detected. it would work even for normal players too. the only drawback is that they will hate smashing the scan button every few seconds."
3/31/2009,"macros input commands, how they respond to dynamic data is not known, and cloak means no-show-up thank you for finally agreeing with me- actively scanning to replace local."
3/31/2009,"how about this:the people who want to keep local will have an option to always appear in local. but those of us who don't want to show up in local, we won't show up unless we speak.everybody gets what they want!and you have no right to make me show up in local against my will."
3/31/2009,"stupid idea. 0.0 is already too empty ,who the hell will do ratting or mining,if they can get nearly as much isk/hour in supersafe empire doing missions, if this no local will be implemented? noone.then who do you want to attack with your small roaming gangs? possibly noone will be there to be your target or maybe another pvp gang.but because you wont be able to know their numbers for sure you can be eaily out numbered (lots of them can be cloaked). one side will surely bring in more numbers to achieve victory --> blobbing. so there wont be small fleets only some larger fleets without targets. and the usuall high end moon blob wars in 1-2 systems thats all. if you want to increase the risk(what this proposal will do) in 0.0 okay but then increase the gain too especially for the average 0.0 players and not for some rich alli leaders with moons. what ccp should do is greatly increase asteroid mining income in 0.0 and reduce the stupid jump transfer possibilities like jump bridges. also there should be possible stacionary target for small gangs like pos shooting/station service shooting for huge gangs ,where they can hurt the enemy even if the enemy doesnt want to fight back."
3/31/2009,":= omg , so who the hell would use the show local type if he wouldnt get 100% accurate info? he only gets the negative from it ,but no benefit."
3/31/2009,"i would rat in 0.0 with no local chatand i would enjoy having less competetion from the chinese isk farmer - because i will kill them if they don't leave.and maybe, with less farming and macro mining, the prices of 0.0 goods will go up slightly, making my efforts more profitable.the big alliance mining ops can easily post alt scouts on all gates - essentially alerting everyone of any new arrivals. so yea, basically we get less isk farmers, more reward for real player, more excitement. and there's nothing wrong with losing your ship now and then, when you can cover the losses in just 1 hour of farming."
3/31/2009,i will also rat in 0.0 with the proposed change to local chat.
3/31/2009,"not supported.imo, the reimbursement policy is as great as it gets. don't want to loose isk - don't be an idiot and fit the ship with mods 3x its price and take it to pvp."
3/31/2009,"sorry to hear you lost your ship./totally signed.and for your reference, just over a year ago i petitioned a carrier loss due to a bug and when the ship was reimbursed i got it back exactly as it was fitted before loosing it. including all modules, entire contents of corp-hanger and every ship in the ship maintenance array, even though a lot of this doesn't appear on the killmail.i don't know if the policy has change since then, or if is inconsistant or down to the gm dealing with it. i know i had to petition twice before getting it back and iirc in the end it was dealt with by a senior gm ."
3/31/2009,"ok so darknesss' is jumping into our camp. i was dealing with internet spaceship drama. so basically i was the sentry. i was there to say. hey 80man bs gang is about to jump in. better vamoose. darknesss' comes back into local, he had been jumping into our camp mwding to the gate; getting away, i say on vent. darknesss is back in local. i see nothing maybe 1min. then on vent. ""omg he's back."" i'm thinking? maybe someone came from the other way? then on vent... ""wow what was he in? he instapopped."" ""was he just a shuttle?"" ""no the wreck says gallente elite bs"" ""what the hell happened?""darknesss warped to the gate. right next to me. jumped. i never saw a damn thing.as for the whole idea of the thread.surely he doesnt suggest getting the modules back that were dropped? so he suggests getting a gm to spawn items; or isk value. which certainly cant be good for the economy.also... think of the exploits then. someone figures out how to replicate said bug with 100% success. fit the most expensive ship possible. have a friend kill you. lewt and get gm to spawn new modules for you.also where is the cutoff? can i get my t2 fit insured drake completely respawned and everything? or is it just for these highprofile eve player 5bil isk kronos bugs?too many holes."
3/31/2009,"this would unleash a flurry of accusations of ""favoritism"". ccp got that kenboku member's officer mods back to him from a goon an didn't explain what the bug was, or they explained the bug but baaahh not true ccp cheats.the ship only reimbursement policy exists because that will be enough for new players, but screw old players, they should know better. the universe is cold, unpredictable and unforgiving."
3/31/2009,"the universe should be cold, but im not talking about the eve universe i'm talking about ccp being at fault and fixing their mistakes. as for players doing it over and over again and exploiting it, i dont see how its too random to and if they got caught it would be a perma ban. even so i'm not saying my suggestion is the best way to go but merely the situation needs addressing because atm all eve is is favouritism, some people lose things get everything back, some get nothing back. the ammount of times ive heard people who have petitioned in a fight got their ship back, someone else in gang petitioned the same thing and got turned away.ccp couldnt possibly be any worse with reimbursement than they are now."
3/31/2009,who needs to do it more than once? 3b off an exploit is more than enough for a few minutes' work.
3/31/2009,"try it, it would take you hours to find a worthy target in high sec, then you can repeat your ganking attemps with concord killing you until you no longer can enter high sec.you think you'll make money?"
3/31/2009,support
3/31/2009,supported.exploiting aggro and logoff mechanics is making pvp too easy to avoid. not simply because of the ctrl q at a gate but also seeing gangs log off everyone but their cloaked scout until you go away.i like the idea of a packet sent to differentiate between a ctrl q and a genuine disconnect. don't know if it is possible but that would seem to be a solid idea in principle.zos
3/31/2009,"should be changes yes.and no it is impossible to differentiate between real disconnect and a ctrl+q. well that would be possible, but then they would just pull out their network cable or disable their wireless. (or do something more fancy by letting their firewall block all eve packets)."
3/31/2009,"love the idea, because it'd look awesome.not that i think it'll be implemented in the near future, but oh well."
3/31/2009,yes please i'd like to see the citadel launchers open up from the hull on my phoenix or cruise/torp launchers on my ravens
3/31/2009,agreed i want phoenixes with some nice launchers opening up
3/31/2009,"have you tried flying a torp raven? it will even put up a fight to the most feared gallente mega pilots :)anyways, supported definitely. more shinyness always welcome!"
3/31/2009,/signedwould be very useful with no drawbacks that i can think of.
3/31/2009,"plenty of people are signing without reading the counter-arguments. the skill que knocked off most plausible complaints from the skill system. to go this far is just pushing it. the point of not being able to inject the skills before pre-reqs is to facilitate a number of things. 1. the skill stays a physical item until you inject it. this allows you to change your mind and sell it, or lose it - which to me is a fine risk for something you can't use yet anyway.2. you can't do physics without arithmetic. it fine-tunes your skillque to mainly leveling skills you already have and want to get better in. which means...3. you actually have to fraking sign into eve and change your character sometimes.not supported. we have our skill que,lets not get ridiculous.edit : yeah because textbooks add nothing to real-life."
3/31/2009,"i actually bumped againt this the other day. let me give you the example.i was training drones v, and knew that immediately following that i was going to train drone interfacing 1.so i wait until my drone v gets down to under 24 hours left - i.e. i actually have room in my skill queue for a new skill. i try and add drone interfacing 1.nope, sorry, no can do. admittedly, it's a minor annoyance - i just stuck a three hour skill in there, and then waited until drones 5 completed before i added drone interfacing, but it doesn't make much sense to me to have it implemented that way."
3/31/2009,except that the reason ccp stated for the skill queue at all is to allow you to more easily determine what time of day you 'fraking' (?) sign into eve.
3/31/2009,"and the skill queuq accomplishes that objective... so what exactly is the purpose for this? other than to further distance and abstract the skill system.i haven't seen a single logical argument for this implementation, only people who want to manage their characters a little less.if you can't manage your time with a 24 hours queue, plus the ability to tag long skills onto the end of it, then perhaps this isn't the game for you."
3/31/2009,"it's more about completing a feature. yes, the queue does let you keep your training time utilized, but it, in some instances, does not allow you to fully maximize your training time. this would get rid of the only hurdle in the way, and with virtually no work required by ccp. i guess i still don't understand the reasons against this, unless the general population is so used to 'almost complete' features in the game, that the prospect of something being finished is foreign, and frightening.it doesn't really matter either way to me, as i don't think i even have any skills to inject that i don't meet the prereq for, but i still wish to see the game constantly improved."
3/31/2009,"if the block list works like i think it does, this should be fairly low-lag. i wouldn't use it myself, but it would have use to some people. it's not a priority, but sure."
3/31/2009,"tracking enchancers are likely that way because it's meant as a compromise to gank for snipers, and more or less useless to most short range weapons (pulse lasers are still quite well effected by them)"
3/31/2009,"hi, i am in the wormhole with some player since 4 days with a pos.and some players have began to mine some gravitometric.the situation is too stupid, i have only one covetor and the medium intensive refining array is completely out to follow the covetor.the first proposal is to increase the capacity of refining arrayexample : medium 25k -> 100kintensive 200k -> 500kor to add a new array for make the compression before refining same process than the rorqual"
3/31/2009,"stopped reading right there tbh. refining arrays are fine. get a dang rorqual or live with the array. --isaacp.s. want more support for your idea? quit saying its stupid. its how it currently operates and that's what ccp wanted. now, why don't you be more constructive. also, they will never make the refining array act like a rorqual. otherwise, that nerfs the ship."
3/31/2009,"sorry but in some wormhole, it's not possible to pass with rorqual.and how do you make in this case ?and not every body is in low sec."
3/31/2009,maybe don't live in the wormhole?
3/31/2009,"i'm likin.not likin.some pretty damn stupid players.ya it's a funneh thing the reactor. basically anyone who might want to use it. will easily overrun the stupid thing. add on top of that. the thing basically hogs the whole tower; takes forever; and uses tons of fuel.big waste of time, isk, and energy.yep. our mining op got to about 150km3 and i was like. ya um time to stop mining.thusly making the actual rorqual useless?sorry but proposal isnt supported; as it isnt very practical.the refiners blow chunks; that's for sure. 25% loss... just because?boosting these refiners hurt who? rorquals more or less? but even then there's value in using rorqual still. who is left to take advantage of the boost? 0.0 and low sec people. they dont have stations to put stuff into. im pretty sure a 0.0 mining boost sure wont hurt things.some might come and say. but jason. what about the drone regions? pff those guys are so heavy in sov 3 and minnie outposts and easily defendable choke systems rolling into like 9-10 systems. those guys wont even bother using refiners."
3/31/2009,"i dont think any of that post had any sentence structure in it :)but from what i have read, you want a array that can compress ore.that sounds like a good idea, but it would make the rorqual almost useles apart from the bonuses and the jump ability."
3/31/2009,"yep the rorqual have not the same utility than the ""compressing array""with the rorqual have an nice bonus, the clone jump, hangar array, compressing ore.and it's not possible to use the rorqual on all wormhole.sorry for me this request is interesting."
3/31/2009,"understanding that english is not your first language, there is a problem. this statement, in english, doesn't mean anything:""the situation is too stupid, i have only one covetor and the medium intensive refining array is completely out to follow the covetor.""please restate."
3/31/2009,i think he's saying that the array can't keep up.
3/31/2009,"yeah, that was my guess as well... i guess it comes down to how long you are mining in a day... i believe an intensive refining array can refine 1111m<U+FFFD>/min, so really, a single covetor would only really exceed it's capacity if mining more than 18 hours a day... need more capacity, get more refineries..."
3/31/2009,completely agreed!
3/31/2009,"imho there are a few ships that need they're bonuses tweaked.guristas shipsall guristas ships have split bonuses, caldari skill boosts missiles, gallente boosts hybrids. every other pirate ship has either twin bonuses focused on one weapon type, or a bonus to a weapon plus a bonus to some other element of the ship.rattlesnake:i've never seen a rattler fitted with hybrids and this is probably true for a number of reasons:1.) it only has 4 hardpoints.2.) even if it had 6/7/8 it doesn't have the pg to fit them and anything else.3.) if you try to fit hybrids/mwd/point/web/cap booster you either have two slots for a tank or have to armour tank, and either way you run out of pg by a huge factor.fix: scrap the hybrid bonus, add a different gallente-style bonus (5%/10% drone hp + damage bonus would be ideal). also would be very nice to add a 7th launcher hardpoint and bigger drone bay even without bandwidth to match. gila:not as bad as the rattle, but overshadowed as a hybrid platform by deimos / brutix / vigilant / eagle and even probably the thorax. once again changing the gallente bonus to a drone based one and giving it a reasonable drone bay would keep its different flavour but make it more useful, +1 launcher hardpoint too.worm:tbh i have never flown one, so i won't comment on downsides / upsides of bonuses.pilgrim:i'm sure this has been mentioned before, but the only use i can find for this ship is ninja-ratting against sansha's. its too slow to catch intys / dictors and without fitting faction neuts it can't attack anything larger without being in overloaded web range. the rapier + arazu get a bonus to their primary ewar range, the falcon already has range and gets a strength bonus, yet the pilgrim is left with short-range + strength bonus.fix: swap the 20% per level neut amount bonus, for 20% range bonus, or give it 10% range bonus and 10% amount bonus."
3/31/2009,"you're putting together two very separate issues, and you might have more luck splitting them. that said...pilgrim: agree fully. the pilgrim has always seemed a joke to me - without a range bonus, it doesn't really do very much. it's in need of a bonus of some sort, and dropping neut effect for neut range seems the natural way to go. guristas: again, agree fully. who slaps a blaster bonus on a raven? the vindicator is the right sort of model for putting a third bonus on an existing ship - find something novel that combos well with the existing two(a mwd bonus on a blaster ship), and you've got a ship that is actually sensible and functional. put a mediocre bonus on that doesn't fix very much and you have a mediocre ship once the nano fit stops being broken(machariel). and put a bonus on that most people actively ignore, and you've got a ship that just feels like a raven you bought because you didn't notice that extra 0 in the price. faction ships should be different in ways that make them useful. a shield-tanking paladin is a novel concept, and the nightmare runs with it admirably. a battleship tackler is a fairly bad role, and the bhaalgorn isn't very good at it, but it at least feels like a faction ship - it does weird, cool things. the idea of a missile/drone ship that is actually worthwhile seems like it'd be in the nightmare category - usable, interesting, and effective. if you really boost the crap out of it, it might even be worth the isk but yeah, i agree with both. and if you can arrange a review of the blood and maybe angel ships while you're at it, that'd be cool too."
3/31/2009,then why have a curse? that's always been my question. the pilgrim has in your face neuting while the curse is farther out. why change it? --isaac
3/31/2009,"the whole full speed, warp cloaked. lets you get a pretty good setup off on people. in most situations i'd think neut amount would be better then range. however in the more bloby situation. that which pvp is. pilgrim really is left out pretty bad.honestly giving em 20% range and 20% amount wouldnt be terrible. then again. falcon is being nerfed bigtime. so might as well let one of the recons fail with the falcon.yep. horrible. needs to be fixed. we were promised this during empyrean age. we didnt get it.ps. i could swear the nightmare used to have torp bonuses; with 4 launcher slots.proof of nightmare with launchers - old 2007 nanobs vid"
3/31/2009,"in large fleet battles, 100km warp ins, big complexes, whatever, sometimes you just want to look at something far away. i mean you can physically zoom out and spin the view around so you can get close to an object, but this is very annoying to do with objects far away. since eve is a very pretty game with beautiful spaceships and whatnot, why should you be limited in what you can see? i propose that one should be able to ""look at""/""set as parent"" on anything on the grid. as long as you can zoom out and see it, why can't you zoom in for a closeup? this would make it a little easier on film makers, and also further facilitate the detailed graphics of eve.tldr: if you can zoom out and see something, you should be able to get a closeup. (you can get a closeup already, it's just difficult)"
3/31/2009,agreed.
3/31/2009,agreed. this has always seemed weird to me. look range should be grid range.
3/31/2009,"your client already knows where the object is, so why can't it look ?it's only a client-side change we are asking for here.now if it was at the edge of the grid and on the other side there was a ship that you couldn't see, but the ship you chose to look at could see, you still wouldn't be able to see it because seeing it would require more work from the server."
3/31/2009,"simplest option:r-click player, select 'spam' option. until you leave system they will be blocked (for you). if enough individuals select 'spam' in a given period of time, the person is gagged for a certain period of time (i would be satisfied with an hour... lets me get my shopping done without their annoying yammering). if enough people flag the spammer in a 24 hour period, or in multiple systems in a short time, the character is gagged or their account locked pending investigation of the spammed material.that'll stop the spammers dead in their tracks, but leave a little breathing room for legitimate sellers."
3/31/2009,"thing is, he has no chance whatsoever of getting that ""problem"" fixed - it's fundamental to eve. he at least has a chance at getting a npc deposit bank implemented."
3/31/2009,"so what you're saying is his overall chances range from ""slim"" to ""none""?"
3/31/2009,"that, and that i won't fault him for giving slim a shot, even if it isn't terribly good policy."
3/31/2009,i'd like to just be able to split my isk up into different piles - it would make keeping to a budget much easier if you had all your spare isk in another wallet...
3/31/2009,if you want to keep you isk then don't give it to random people you meet on the internet.working as intended imo.
3/31/2009,"oh, multiple wallets is definitely something i could support - one of the beautiful things about being in a small corp is that you can ask the ceo for a spare wallet for when you want to track a couple things separately. i'd be all for that option being open to others as well. thing is, this proposal isn't that."
3/31/2009,"i recommend eve bank. thats eve-bank.netlavista vista helped write the code for that one i believe. as for an npc bank, thats probably never going to happen."
3/31/2009,"i have been playing with this idea of adding a ship which is capable of scanning like the covert ops but has the ability to participate in pvp as the covert ops class have no added value other than scanning (which doesn't drive a lot of people to choose this ship as they're ship of choosing).so i present my idea of adding the patrol attack ship.based on the destroyer class hull it is a ship designed for probing down opponents and holding them down for a limited amount of time.i won't bore you with endless statistics which will bore you to tears and will never see the living daylight so i'll outline the main points of my idea here:general bonusesit would include something in the likes of a bonus to the range or/and strength of combat scanner probes and a small bonus to the range of warp scrambling devices. also standard a cpu bonus for the expanded probe launcher should be added so it can be fitted easily.offensive capabilitiesmake it able to wield a small amount of small guns and possibly even drones. but make sure that it will not become a solo ship.defensive capabilitiesgive it a medium sized tank so that it can last and will not have a paper tank. on top of that give it a heavy mass so it is not the next best nano tank (due to heavy armor plating/shielding equipment).cloaki don't think a ship such as this would need the ability of a cloak the ship's scan strength or/and range should be enough to make it able to scan quickly.race bonusesonly dependant on the gun types so it has a little fire-power.prerequisite skillsracial frigate 5covert ops 4destroyers 5astrometrics 5it should be in line with the skill time of the interdictors.in conclusion:i personally think this could be a viable ship in pvp for finding people in safespots without sacrificing good tackling ability and a capable damage ship.now support it, flame it, discuss it."
3/31/2009,"i think this is a cool idea, as it would possibly call another use of the destroyer class.my only problem is your name. i think they should be called hunter killers."
3/31/2009,"a couple changes i think:first off: skill requirement:racial frigate 5covert ops 5destroyers 5astrometrics 5my opinion, it should be five for all four skills. offensive abilities:no drones, unless its gallente. about five guns sounds right to me. cloak:t2 cloaking device sure, but no cov-ops cloak. otherwise, ship sounds pretty good, but i don't see the need of it atm. yes, the covert frigate is not the greatest thing to fly in the world, but it gets the job done really well. some people i know also use it to tackle people (at risk sure). so in short, i don't see the need, but more ships isn't a bad idea. --isaac"
3/31/2009,"i agree with the basic idea... a probing ship that can do something other than sit there uselessly.with caveats, of course.base it off the tier-2 bc hull. give it an insane tank. give it the marauder weapon bonuses and limited weapon mounts (so they can fit utility modules such as tractors/salvagers).make it slow as sin. do not give it any weapon bonuses of any sort other than the marauder damage bonuses on limited hardpoints. do not allow it to fit covert cloaks (allow it to use non-covert cloaks, as bombers do) to prevent them becoming cloaking guerilla fighters, but no velocity bonus.essentially give it the ability to do two things:scan swiftlywork plexes finds.but worthless in any sort of pvp (or they'll become fotm gank fleets).end of story."
3/31/2009,lol. so you figured out a couple ways to evade them. meh.so basically you want to make a system where you can kill someone in highsec. they cant even see you coming. while taking no losses at all?you know there's an exploit. where you essentially have a person accepted into a corp. while they are basically in warp and about to drop in on a group of people. or have the gang log out where you know the camp will be. accept their apps. log in at the same time. etc etc. all these are considered exploits. gms have made posts saying they are exploits.why do you think your exploit is better then any other exploit?
3/31/2009,"i wouldn't mind seeing the black ops exploit get legitimized.i mean, dropping over a billion isk on a gank ship that has a very good chance of not surviving long enough to jump out is both 1.) awesome and 2.) very risky.i don't see the problem, frankly. if you lose your hulk to a black ops, get another one and mine in the same system with a cloaked friend in fleet with tackle nearby. next time he tries it- pow! concordokkened and you get a bunch of shiny loot to replace your loss.i feel like that would be fun as hell for both the black ops and the targets and considering the immense cost of the ship i dont feel like it would start happening all over the place. remember, the black ops really only has the time to strike and jump out in 0.5, maybe 0.6 space and it has a window of only a few seconds to pull it off."
3/31/2009,"there have been a hp bug which reduce your effective hp to extremely low, properly what happened.the -10 sec pilot.. well that's just extremely bad and lame mechanic from ccp which they should stick where the sun don't shine.. so ertarded"
3/31/2009,"a-tards all of you ffs. read or is it over your intellectual level?.he said he had auto pilot on at the gate, which means at 0 from gate so he garentee to jump as soon as possible, then to manually jump to next gate.ffs. people are such a holes these days."
3/31/2009,indeed.
3/31/2009,"it's r-tard.anyway, by his typing, let me paint this picture.he's on the gate either into (likely perimeter) or jita (to perimeter). traffic control closes the gate. he has 600mil in an apparent t1 hauler, worth roughly 200k isk. my math sucks, what's that, like 0.03 of the value of the goods transported?ok, so he's got ap on, so when the gate opens he jumps through... are you sure? never tried it.so i'll put myself in this situation for a second...i'm stupid enough to haul that much worth, with that little yugo ship.the instant i realize the gate is closed, i will buger off and warp away. i will not sit there hoping some miracle opens the gate for me.the -10 player did nothing wrong. this shouldn't be in this forum, it should be in c&p where he can be mocked. repeatedly.i have done runs into lowsec, 0.0, and through all the hubs with hundreds of millions... hell, even billions in cargo. not once have i ever been ganked.i've been targetted, i've been attacked.play it smart, and you minimize your losses. i'll die eventually, but i'll be sure it's not because of doing something this idiotic."
3/31/2009,"1. don't go to jita, if you can avoid it. 2. if you can't avoid jita, transport your stuff via courier contract. let someone else take the risk.3. if you can't wait for a contract, use a solid vessel that has a good tank. that means battleship or orca in highsec.4. always split your risk. if you can do it in multiple runs, don't do it in one, unless you can risk losing it.5. if you carry immense value, never stop. if a gate is locked, use another. if all gates are locked, warp around in the system till they open up again. never play sitting duck.6. if red flashing people are anywhere near, watch like a hawk.7. don't go to jita, if you can avoid it. p.s.: be glad it was only 600 million. your corpmates will understand. after all, they were bright enough to let you haul that much unescorted and all by yourself from jita. they could have jumped into some ships, too. would have split your risk."
3/31/2009,"concord doesn't pod - he flew in in a pod, grabbed a bs, and shot you in said bs. if that's what the gm claims, it's likely what happened. as for the 300 damage thing, you're the second person i've heard complaining about that - look at the reimbursement policy thread, some guy was saying the same about his kronos, and mentioned a titan having 100 hp as well. petition it on the basis of this hp bug(since it sounds like you just petitioned the -10 guy shooting you), and you might have a bit more luck."
3/31/2009,"get off our board troll. this isn't an issue, or a proposal. you are simply full of fail."
3/31/2009,"i'm not sure, posting on a public forum that you carry billions of cargo in a hauler might come close :)"

3/31/2009,"hello my fellow internet spaceship captains. i am pleased to announce my candidacy for the csm. my history in this game is very different from most of yours. joining goonfleet on day 1 of playing this game, i flew my ibis directly out into 0.0 (nobody told me about podjumping ), and right from the start i have immersed myself in all that is good and bad about life in nullsec. i am a firm believer that the best parts of eve are found in the high space drama that occurs out in 0.0, yet so much of the playerbase is unwilling or unable to venture out away from the protection of concord. i want to make 0.0 more fun and rewarding for everyone. and my goal as a csm is to push for 0.0 changes.here's my campaign website:"
3/31/2009,"it's not concord that draws ppl to highsec m8. it's independence. freedom.i got tired of being taxed, ordered to show up at xxx-xx at a certain time, also i was a meatshield for other people's moon mining operation and they don't give nothing back, basically i was playin the game for someone else's benefit.not sayin all alliances are like this but it just left a bad taste in my mouth.right now i have every part of the game at my disposal, at the time of my choosing.i got r&d production going.i got nice sized rats spawned for my killing pleasure.a minihub 6 jumps away for trading.a lowsec system 8 jumps away when i wanna get froggy.a mining system 13 jumps away when i wanna mine and watch a movie.if i want 0.0 providence is close.i log in when i want, do what i want, and best of all no tax.yes i miss having gangs to fly with but i can't imagine trading away my freedom.freedom is why i play eve, when the freedom is gone so am i."
3/31/2009,"everything you said is true. life in 0.0 is a hassle, and the real rewards of life in 0.0 (moons, plexes, supercap construction) are only feasible for big alliances. i see this as a problem and i want to improve it without nerfing anything about life in empire."
3/31/2009,"your ideas have merit, however i think larkonis managed to get in a bit before you.he seems to be the un-official c&p delegate and given how many ""carebear"" candidates there are, i think it would be important for at least 1 pvp based candidate to get through.i'm unsure if by running you would be increasing or decreasing the chance that a delegate who regularly pvps (and more then just shoots stuff, actually understands wtf is happening) is voted in."
3/31/2009,"issler, thanks for your words, although we have been on opposing sides of the battlefield and the smack talk i can appreciate your words, i believe we can work together focusing on the different facets of eve so to make it a better game keeping in mind all game play styles!mickey simon,i have read (now) the pod of larkonis, whereas his manifesto looks more like a ""dark side"" of the pvp i hoped to work for the benefit of all pvp, i for example dont think that resources have to be diminished in empire, just make it so that empire stays as it is, low sec should be richer by a multiplier of 1.5 than empire and 0.0 richer by a multiplier of 2 than empire, but this is my opinion, what i would like is to hear as many different people as possible so to understand what the specific view on different points is. my view is that there must not be a compartimentalization of the game (the blobbers - the crazy pirates/mercs - the carebears)my candidacy will have the goal of better defining pvp as a profession, noir. i'm sure wouldnt mind yulai convention approved contracts for mercs and assassins.thank you for your input guys!"
3/31/2009,"simple - i want to promote freedom to play the game in as many ways as possible, the large sandbox for all. i also wish to help ccp improve the game, particularly with balancing of game mechanics and follow up on various initiatives that ccp has already started upon. i will also try to offer a newer player perspective to the game, with me personally having less than 20 million skill points and less than 2 years playing. the free trip to iceland is also cool (although, i will have to bring my wife, so it wont really be free.. cause if i dont bring her, she will kill me!)"

3/31/2009,"the idea of doing away with local has been floating around for some time. the recent glitch to local on sisi (whether intentional or not) has sparked a few discussions/rages about its potential fate. i am completely local neutral, so if it stays or goes i could care less. i do, however, see a potential repurposing for the recently defunct pos module, the system scanning array.empire, for all intensive purposes, is civilized space. per concord mandate, system occupants are reported via the local system for all to see. nothing changes.low-sec and npc 0.0 space are a gray area since technically they are faction, not concord, occupied space. for these areas, local would be paired with positive standings with the occupying faction. take molden heath for example, if you have positive standings with the minmatar republic, local appears as it currently does. if you have neutral or negative standings, local is reported on a broadcast only basis (similar to alliance chat). access to local would be based on true standings, not as modified by the various social skills, so players seeking to gain access to local must earn the tactical advantage.0.0 space, being lawless and unoccupied, does not report local by default. it acts solely on a broadcast basis where you only appear upon posting. now bring back the system scanning array (sov1 anchor, sov2 online) and make it so the controlling alliance has the option to provide local through associated standings. this provides a home turf advantage to the occupying alliance that they can see system occupants in local but hostiles can not. this also means that just as jammers and jump bridges are taken out as a part of 0.0 sov wars, it allows local communications to be taken down as well.the data elements to do this should already be inherent to local as standings are reported to make the little blue and red boxes next to names. all that would be needed is a conditional pre-filter to determine player access to local on a system-by-system basis.the end result would leave local in place where it is most wanted while adding a whole new positive element to low-sec, npc 0.0 and alliance controlled space."
3/31/2009,"i understand what it means to repackage a ship. its basically taking it apart and packing it into a smaller space. what i don't get is why they wont let us repackage ships that have rigs on them. technically the rigs are a part of the ship when you install them, when you remove them they are destroyed. so they are nonetheless part of the ship and can be taking apart with the ship and put back together since its not being removed from the ship.i don't see any particular reason to have it to where you repackage a ship you lose your rigs. wouldn't it increase the risk of transporting ships if they still had the rigs installed??sorry just kinda angry since i couldn't fit a ship thats 55,000 volume and (5500 packaged) into an obelisk that has over 800k room. even with the ship unpackaged theres plenty of room for it to fit.what yall say? repackage ships with rigs ok??"
3/31/2009,"i think t2 bpo's are fine as they are. for the older corps to last this long in a world like eve is proof that they should hold onto that bpo. eve isn't about fairness and older characters are always rewarded for being with the game because they sat through a bunch of ****. does it hurt the market a little and make an un-exhuastible source of income for the holder. yes. but it doesn't matter since they were here first and got it before it was gone.if ****es me off just as much as anyone that i won't be able to get a bpo of a t2 item, and if i buy any bpc's then its just pure profit for the guy who made it.but how about instead of taking it away, give it a decay factor? just like ships and mods, if the t2 bpo isn't used for what.....3 months, it goes back on the lottery. instead of destroying them how about re-circulating them if their on inactive accounts or if they are just sitting in hangers not being used?even though i like happy mediums....i still stand by that they lucked out on it and everyone else will just have to deal with it and suck it up."
3/31/2009,"get some billion and buy it. no on the first count. the only field where the t2 bpo influence the market are the items where no sane inventor want to invent anything. remove the bpo and the t2 items will disappear as the few t2 items build today will be replaced by named/faction items.one example are the t2 armor plates. they are worse than rolled tungsten and cost the same. remove the bpo and i doubt anyone will care to invent them. for the ""un-exhuastible source of income"" they work exactly as any other bpo. after you have brought it it give you an income if you build from it. so any bpo is a ""un-exhuastible source of income""."
3/31/2009,"thats pretty much how it works...if you want a t2 bpo, buy one, but be prepared to wait for a year or so before you start making your money back. they are not isk printing licenses these days, not like they were before invention. as an inventor i may not be able to make the margins, but i can vastly outdo the t2 bpo holder in output."
3/31/2009,"1) defense of the low-end computer users. (let us turn off effects entirely: pos shields, bubbles, textures: let me turn them off.)2) support of user-generated content: let us create stuff.examples:- change poses to modular structures (...like t3), instead of this annoying click-and drag interface. let us configure how they look, similar to the amazing structures found in some missions.- let corporations create missions for the general public to accept.3) make missions / interaction more in-your-face. for example, seize camera control (but let us break out!) and zoom the camera in advanced mode towards an enemy spawn that us usually announced in local. give us more dialog, more realism, and more interaction.4) let me fiddle with things outside of the intended game mechanics! let me be creative and try things from a roleplaying standpoint, and make unexpected things happen. for example, let me steal the maiden from the mission, which results in the mission agent hiring faction npcs to chase me down. let me shoot at things i'm not supposed to shoot at, poke and play with things, and make something interesting happen!feedback welcome, and my right to append to this list is reserved."
3/31/2009,there is no doubt in my mind that user generated content (when done correctly) is the future. so i like the idea we could have some discussions among the csm candidates about your suggestions.issler
