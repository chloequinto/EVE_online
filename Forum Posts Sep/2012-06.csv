6/1/2012,"so... you're proposing to have an actual carrier added? a ship capable of holding a fleet of smaller ships would be useful, both to pve'ers, pvp'ers and miners. miners would be able to store their valuable hulks inside it when things come to kill them, leaving a gang of less valuable mining-ships, or maybe a few destroyers to counter gankers with. pve'ers would be able to have a noctis stored, to save time when they need to go get the salvage-boat (they could just as well have a noctis lying out here, unless they have two mission-runners who both want to salvage, which is just improbable. pvpers... i can't even begin to imagine how useful this would be to pvp'ers. they would be able to roam around in their small gangs with a single tug carrying a bunch of spare ships.of course, this all assumes the tug-ship's ship hangar can be accessed like the orca's can, so they can change ships on the fly, and possibly even re-fit their ships, depending on the needs.all in all, supported. it adds a lot of possibility to the sandbox, and i can't see why it shouldn't be added."

6/1/2012,"+100500. this needs to have been done years ago. corp thieves and other miscreants that do not produce kill rights will just need a completely different system, is all, but this one will already fix numerous problems.mind if i offer a tiny tweak though?at"
6/1/2012,"if you keep this contract system separate from the bounty system as it is now (except with changes to how the isk is payed out to prevent alts collecting bounties), then that problem is already solves.i dont see any reason why not. it would create more consequences for shooting at people illegally. i always like that. nothing it stopping them. i don't think it should be stopped. if someone is resourceful enough to pull something like this off they deserve to reap the benefits.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
6/1/2012,"actually, upon reflection, i do see a potential problem. consider this scenario:character x is a corp spy. he joins a corp, gains trust, then steals everything not nailed down, and before he's kicked, to add insult to injury, he suicide ganks everyone he can get his hands on in hopes of gaining bounties on his head. assuming that one can invariably place the bounty on the entire (player) corporation the criminal is a member of, this would more often than not be the default way of handling things. once x is kicked from the corp the next day, everyone ends up with bounties they did nothing to deserve, in addition to the theft losses, and they can do pretty much nothing to prevent that particular problem, no matter how well they secure their assets or vet members. it's more problematic than awoxing.i believe that the current corp landscape is plenty paranoid enough already, so the only solution that seems reasonable to me is to produce kill rights on everyone who shot the aggrieved party at all (and their logi!) and make it possible to bulk package them in a single bounty contract."
6/1/2012,great ideas.
6/1/2012,"no, you can shoot pods below -5."
6/1/2012,"been in my share of nullsec alliances, they are either stuck up jerks, cta mongers, corp/alliance thiefs, paranoid freaks, power hungry dictators, or just simply boring.many people do truthfully dislike having to kiss up to much of the current jumble of jerks."
6/1/2012,"why are you so insistant on trying to blame miners? my friend lost her first (and only, ever) covetor in a quiet system, while her husband watched local, d sacnned, both aligned, and flew with her for safety. you seem to have forgotten that in highsec you don't get automatic blue + (or not) for everyone in system. you only get that in null. people who are paying attention and doing all you suggested lose mining ships every day, because the systems are simply weak and/or broken. why does negative security status not automatically tag a pilot a warning colour in highsec local? that is part of why null is safer, because the us/them dichotomy actually works, and effectively tags all treats. but new & casual players can't do anything in null, if you take them there, they will likely quit the game.as for being able to pod at -5, good luck with that. unless suicide ganking miners is changed to put you to -5, then gankers will kill a ton of people, and use an alt to collect their own bounty if it ever gets high enough to be in risk of getting podded. remember that the bounty system is meant to protect people like miners, by allowing them to hire pvp players to kill thier foes. and we all know that system is horribly broken.a new thought that came into my head : kill rights should be able to be made into an item, and sold. so that the miners really can give the contract to kill someone. the right should also work as a ""key"" to activate locator services on the target in any bounty office. after all, concord and the empires know where these people are."
6/1/2012,"you can change and costomise your overlay - and i've made mine give people with negative sec status a coloured background. that helps me in lo-sec.the problem with industrialists getting our own back on suicide gankers is. . . regardless of any kill rights / bounties / transferable kill rights, bounty hunting, crime and punishment, other game mechanics yet to be invented. . . etc, etc. . . is the fact that suicide gankers will almost certainly be using a disposable alt. the pilot who ganks you today will be biomass this time next month if it is easier for them to continue ganking with a new character. without any access to the ""main"" account, the thing that the player has invested time into, suicide ganking is without long term consequence for those who participate. there really isn't anything stopping them from running an entirely different paid account for being naughty on!there is a difference between people playing as pirates long term, and people who create a new account for the purposes of giefing for a couple of weeks. the long term pirate has made a choice and likes that way to play and game mechanics like sec-status affect them. the suicide ganker may well be just having a laugh with a disposable account - and certainly would dispose of it if things were changed to make it harder for that character to continue."
6/1/2012,yup .. you'd just be dead several times over getting there...
6/1/2012,"obviously doesnt know jack **** about the game. go join a mining alliance they will move your **** there for you. otherwise head to npc nullsec, pick a ****** moon and stick your pos there. get a rorq or jump freighter. all you need is patience. mannn you guys wanna make isk the easy way period. eve is dangerous. you've been provided all the tools to keep yourself safe, do it. clearly your friend and husband and village wasnt paying attention to local properly enough. learn the game. learn from your mistakes. lose a ship, just get back missioning and mining to get another. isnt that hard. if you're gonna quit after losing a ship then gtfo no one wants you. this game isnt for the weak. go play wow or something if you dont want to lose your hardearned ****."

6/1/2012,"hi. i'm part of a nullsec alliance that does mining ops and things. not one part of what you just said about them is true in any way, shape or form. try an alliance that isn't led by a mouthbreather and you might like it more"
6/1/2012,"man. you've seriously chosen the wrong alliances to join, haven't you? i haven't had to do any of that all the years i've been in nullsec. vov"
6/1/2012,"this is how eve works. these ""wolves"" as you call them, are actually teaching new players about how the eve world works. true by technicality, but your general idea is flawed. every plex (at least as far as i'm aware) in eve was purchased by someone at some point. therefore every player's playing time was paid for. some players are willing to pay cash for another player's playing time, in exchange for isk. this benefits both players involved, and ccp we don't want you to quit. if you quit then we can't harvest your tears any more. not really. i'm not a vet by any means. i started playing sometime around 2008. i still manage to enjoy the game perfectly fine. if i wanted to create some major nullsec sov holding alliance that produced trillions of isk per day, i have the tools at my disposal to do so, just like every other player. i will agree that the veteran holds the advantage in some ways, such as some vets having t2 bpos that are no longer being created. but on the large scheme of things this isn't a major issue, as it doesn't detract from someone else's enjoyment of the game, because they can still acquire these bpos through purchasing them. nor does it prevent ccp from acquiring new subscribers and holding their current subscribers. if you can't find a way to mine during hulkageddon without getting blown up you probably wouldn't have lasted long in eve anyway, so your argument is moot.continued on next post..."
6/1/2012,"while it's not feasible for a solo miner to produce their own hulk, they can produce their own mining barges perfectly fine. i will assume you were referring to hulks however. there's a reason for the market, and it's perfectly feasible to acquire the isk to purchase your very own hulk, as players do it every day. eve doesn't mean easy by any means.which combat ship has a base hold space of 8000m3? i'm sure there are a lot of traders that would love to know.i'm un-biased on this one, because i don't know all the intended effects from this mechanic etc.so use a battleship fitted with mining lasers when you know ganking is going to be an issue. if ccp felt that you should only be able to mine in one ship, they wouldn't have made it possible to mine in other ships. you can get a maximum yield of 1500 per cycle with a hulk. a rokh is capable of achieving 971 per cycle with three mining laser upgrades and 8 mining lasers. and it still has room for a tank, which you don't need much of to stop gankers. yes, because giving the large alliances a way to make their logistics operations invincible is certainly the best way to solve the issue.continued on next post..."
6/1/2012,"i will directly quote you here, because after all you argue against your own point prior.further, obtaining the isk to purchase and set up a pos in high sec to do research with is actually very feasible for the average player. t1 ships aren't obsolete by any means, there are actually some t1 ships that are more effective than their t2 counterpart. after all, you don't see suicide gankers running around in tengus do you?no. this would allow a single player to horde sites all for themselves, and isn't necessary as there are already existing mechanics that can be used to work around gankers. this is eve, you aren't safe anywhere, and nobody who understands how eve works supports making miners invulnerable. further, if miners became invulnerable, mining would become even less profitable as a result, which is already an existing issue.you're free to hire mercenary corporations to avenge the scammers if you like. therefore the mechanic you suggest is already in place. on top of that, pvp does not mean combat, and there are more forms of pvp than ship vs ship combat. think outside the sandbox.the only mess created as a result of scamming, is the mess that is created in the gm's petition list when the fool who was quickly parted with his isk attempts to get ccp to aide them, to no avail. the person who's creating the mess here is the fool, not the scammer. the scammer is just using game mechanics and greed to his advantage.continued on next page..."
6/1/2012,"players do not appear the same as npc's. npc's come in the form of a plus sign, whether it's red or white. players are in the form of squares in varying sizes based on the size of the ship, as well as their name which generally is not as standard as the npc names. this is something i learned within my first day of playing eve, and isn't information that's too hard to grasp. so you might lose a million isk or so to learn that lesson. in the end it's not a big deal. many lessons in eve come at a far greater cost.as far as i am aware, podding a wanted player does immediately pay out the reward. if it doesn't immediately pay out the reward, then it most likely pays the reward out in the same fashion as pirate bounties (every 15 minutes), which isn't a major issue. engagement times are not lower now because of new ships, because people don't suicide gank in tengus or shiny ships.i think you should stick to not posting your ideas. at the very least don't post them in the assembly hall where they're likely to waste csm members and ccp's time. you should also change the thread title to ""griefers vs carebears, hulkageddon is winning, time for carebears to htfu"".off topic: stop making ridiculously huge walls of text that are a pain in the ass to quote."
6/1/2012,i thought t1 ships were obsolete?
6/1/2012,"actually i would recommend against this for three reasons1. it makes teamwork more important. i remember ratting when someone would come into local all the non afk people would start typing in local to get everyone's attention. now anyone who detected a hostile in local could speak up to warn their slower scanning bretheren. this makes ratting a team effort\2. you never know who is or is not really friendly. when politics get complicated sometimes blues and reds don't quite hold the same meaning3. this would make a scout role important. if you were group ratting you could have one guy jack up his sensor strength and be the designated ""local watcher"" again encouraging group pve.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
6/1/2012,i like the idea of scanning down mining sites for 2 reasons:firstly for the miner it gives a more interactive experience in mining as well as the stated a counter to bots.starts the griefers training those scanning skills to probe you out or using the d scan correctly rather than just warping to belt.i can see further bonus's from a game design pov:you are not going to have the same level of cans anchored in space - should cut down on bookmarks in highsec.a number of pve combat sites that have asteroid belts / spawns can be reused (with or without the npc fleet) as scanned mining sites.i know we already have grav sites and this is an extension of that... heck i'm just happy that after 5 years we are getting a decent look at industry as a whole

""people's skills"" can go a long way to getting rid of an unwanted war dec (as does humor). all you have to do is not be an entitled asshat and work with your attackers to find a mutually agreeable solution. and yes, this does require you to swallow you pride to some degree... and yes, it isn't really fair. but guess what? eve was not designed to be fair.eve is the only game where it is perfectly allowable to ""throw sand"" in your enemy's face to gain the upper hand."

6/1/2012,"eve == everyone vs everyone... everything you do in eve is related to competing with your neighbor. while mining, or mission running, or industry don't involve shooting your neighbor, they affect him. this game allows you to use aggression (wars, suicide ganking, etc) to attack anyone, thereby limiting their influence, restricting their activites, so you can game the system and get ahead. look at events like hulkageddon. while it caters to the schoolyard bullies of society, it's effects modify the entire market, it psychologically changes how many players approach the game, and is a fundamental sandbox driver. i totally understand why people don't like getting ganked, or war decced by a random third party, but learning how to deal with it is a fundamental part of eve. this is not like other mmo's, where the developers protect you. in this game, you are responsible for protecting yourself. the developers provide many, many tools available to you, so you can protect yourself. remember, conflict is the biggest driver in eve. anything that creates more conflict is seen as a great positive, and artificial limits on conflict are seen as undesired."

6/1/2012,"surrely i will not post this sort of thing with my main and i don't espect that who reply do so, don't troll me about that.i played eve for...well...since 2008, so four years, with pauses of course, long and short; i think that i'm seasoned enough for some simple and logic observation.i sperimented the pew pew side of the game, in all sec type of space, and the carabear side, as miner and tech 2 crafter so i'm quite neutral about the all the questions of ""yeah a carabear, kill him"" or ""mmm, those roids are juicy"" but i'm worried about the evolution of event.the ccp powered destroyer ships type and goons catch the momentum for start the biggest hukageddon event that this game got so far, why? isk of course, they controll the right ""moon goo"" for earn much more than 100m for 10 exhumers destroyed, but this isn't the problem, hulkageddon isn't the problem, personally i found that really fun as event, but not as routine, but this is only my considerations and since game mechanics allow it ... the problem is that 3 t1 ship (value is around 15m with shiny t2 fitting) have a sure gank, even in hi sec, if the targhet is an exhumer (not only hulk, even mackinaw that is even more fragile) that worth 200-300m and got income even if they lose ship after they got concorded cause the insurance and the loot, goons bonus a part (a modulated strip miner worth 5-6m you know...), this created a loophole on the efficency of hi sec mining; for those that don't know 65-70% of minerals in eve are made by reprocessing thing, the problem is that reprocess lack of tritanium and pyerite, needed in mass for the production of ships and modules, so the other 20%(about) are made in hi sec for trit mostly; now we got much less miner (cause they don't undock for fear) and of course the price of all modules and ships will go up due the lackness of minerals.[miner question: don't even try to tell me ""just stay focused and don't afk mine, check your scanner"" and this kinda of bullshit, mining is already boring, rewrite the mining sistem if you don't want afk miner, now spam the button of system scanner is too much crazy for me, usually i study when mine, for raise 20-40m in hi sec an hulk need one our of mining, how you expect that a miner stay one our to click the scan button? and another thing, have a tanking hulk, for those who don't know even how a hulks work, mean much less mineral mined for a ship that should be specialized in mining, and even a tanking one don't resist at 3 destroyers (15m and profict even if concorded).]the main problem isn't for old player, that already got all the ship that he wanted and the right buisness for replace those, the main problem is new players, missions will not pay enought for allow him to replace his shity t1 cruiser.my proposal is to rebalance ships (like exhumers) for adapt them with the powered destroyers, not eliminate the hi-sec ganking, is part of game.sorry for my bad spelling and gramm, english isn't my strenght."
6/1/2012,"those destroyers already get no insurance. just saying.why should a civilian non combat craft be able to stand up to multiple pure combat ships anyway? cost is not a factor in ship balancing, the last time they tried to use it as one, we got supercaps. remember that."
6/1/2012,"bullshit, cost is allways a factor of balancing as everyone know in eve, particulary for exhumers cause those ship should bring you money, no one will mine more if a ship that cost 300m can be popped in hi sec from one that cost 5m, exhumers are not fighiter ship, you made an investment if you buy one, if this investment in crappy you don't buy it.civilian non combat ship? aren't we tired of those sort of ****? for pilot an hullk you need toons of skill and money, i don't see where is the ""civilian side"" in that, a vexor is a mining cruiser like the osprey, those are considered ""civilian""?i don't care what you use or who you are, make non-stupid and non-goliardic observation please or don't answer."

6/1/2012,"so no reply? no solution? no more trolling or insult?(bump)this is a real problem, miner profession will be no more cause every player start in hi sec, no one will begine the miner profession cause is unsafe, risky and non profictable, even in hi sec, this cause some old and bored players that got too much skillpoint are too coward for do pvp where needed (0.0) cause goons are too much powerfull? cause you don't whant to risk your slave implant set? cause your carrier cost too much or you don't have the balls for be -10 sec status and be a low sec pirate?bullshit, the first people that should stop to be moron are hi-sec ganker, they don't want that destroyed be nerfed again, they don't want that exhumers will be improved, they don't want that noobs live and say them that eve is a bad game cause everything is unsafe...gankers tears."

6/2/2012,man goes up to you in your face and blows it away on a busy street. what are you going to do about it?
6/2/2012,"you seem to have forgotten something critical.veterans get new players to re-roll using the ""invite a friend"" deal, to get a free plex, up to 10 per account. that is not how ccp wants that deal to be used, it is for getting new players who are not already playing eve to join. but that is not what is going on.the players who are working that borderline-exploit don't want new player to stay. they only want them to subscribe so that they get their free plex, x10, and don't care if the players quit. indeed, the higher the turnover of new players, the better for that near-scam. and let's be real: every player doing that with 10 new players costs ccp us$150 in lost ~real~ subscriptions, for players who ccp had already spent the money to effectively recruit via its advertising spend.bottom line: this game needs new players to stay. stop making excuses for greifers using no-lose ""pvp"" to drive new, casual and social players out of the game.for the record, what was i doing before downtime? mining in null sec, love those 800,000 isk belt rats. that i can and do mine in null does not mean there is not a problem in highsec. it's a problem, if you don't like my proposed solutions, then dream up more to fix it.how about a dual corp token system, that allows players to jump to the corp ""home null base"" (or wh), and ""home base high"" once per day each, so that people can get to null easier to mine, and home to high easier to pve (null sec rats are too hard for many new players)?"
6/2/2012,"there is a daily token. its called ""jump clone"". you can use it once every 24 hours. you can even make it for free at a rorq or eacs."
6/2/2012,"the fact that this may be happening is a different issue altogether. it is not relevant to the op. there are always going to be unscrupulous users that will take advantage of promotions. this obviously isn't hurting ccp too badly, because if it were they would have found a resolution to it by now. i doubt the people involved want to see eve go out of business. i also doubt it's being done as much as you claim. the main reason i doubt it's being done so frequently, is because nothing stands to be gained from doing this. the ""scammer"" as you would call them, is only getting a month of service, in exchange for a plex.the fact that you mine in null sec has little relevance. null sec mining is more profitable than high sec mining, therefore it's more desirable to mine in null sec. it is a problem, indeed. but it's your problem. there are plenty of miners who get by just fine. if you're too lazy/stupid to figure out how to avoid suicide gankers, that is your problem, and is not cause for extremist changes to the game that very few actually want.this mechanic already exists via jump clones. the fact you don't already know this suggests you know very little about the game indeed. i had absolutely no problems ratting in null sec anomalies with a 2 million skill point character, so your argument that null sec rats are too hard for many new players is moot. not to mention the fact that null sec isn't exactly aimed at new players.you seem to have forgotten many of the game mechanics, and basic logic. or maybe you just didn't bother researching the basic game mechanics."
6/2/2012,alt in a hyena.next question?
6/2/2012,"wow, you seem to be missing the whole point. if i want you dead, you're going to be dead. it doesn't matter how many ways you try to stop it, a ganker *will* kill you if they want too.here is one for you: bs drops on top of both your ships and starts smartbombing. hyena pops, you lose your web. hulk pops because you can't warp off suddenly.no matter how you slice it, you will lose both ships and most likely the pods too.and yet again, people using alts to try and keep from getting killed still get killed.i'll state it again, if i want you dead you will be dead. nothing will prevent it. the sooner you get that concept through, the sooner we can move on to a proper discussion."
6/2/2012,"1.-- by making intl shared between fleet members, it rewards those who are already in fleet. if you are in a fleet together, you moreless are working together. it also means you're more capable to form up a response gang. it also provides a way to share intel with non-alliance members. 2.-- but you do know who is friendly, mostly. that's the point of the standings system. 3.-- you might still want this... it just means his intel is shared with his fleet members too... gathering information on your opponents shouldn't be completely handed to you on a silver platter. have tools to share the intel you took the time to gather makes that intel much more valuable to everyone you share it with!"

6/2/2012,i do agree that the nerf bat might have beed swung to har on the drone regions..... deal with it.
6/2/2012,"this post is too long. if that offends you, please don't read it, and save us both a flame war.looking at the whole miner-ganker debacle raging in full force on the forums, i can't support either extreme opinion. complaining about gankers being able to attack in the first place shows a blatant disregard of what the game really is in favour of what you think it should be like, which is silly. blaming miners for all the ills of the game is just as silly, not to mention that willingly participating in rolecide on that scale is not terribly wise in the long run.but why do miners mine solo and afk in the first place?suppose you were carrying a big money bag across town, would you go alone? you would probably hire a bodyguard. what would that bodyguard do, were you to be attacked? in worse parts of town, they'd pull the gun on the attacker, and probably fire preventively ""in self-defense"". in better parts of town, they'd shield you with their bodies, and then pull the gun on the attacker anyway once the intent to harm is clear.in eve, whatever bodyguards the miners might hire are out of either option anywhere outside nullsec, where they can just bubble the gate into the system and/or filter the much shorter local list, where non-blues are readily apparent. they can't preventively shoot anyone in high sec, because they get concorded immediately, and giving them that option in any fashion would open untold potential for abuse. they sort of can shoot first in lowsec, but they get a sec status hit for it and eventually become outlaws if they keep it up, which isn't good for business. they can't shield anyone with their body in any way, and they can't stop the alpha strike before the deed is actually done, since all it takes is one or two cycles. since it's all about alpha, keeping a logi up on the miner won't really do much good, as logi won't cycle fast enough.since bodyguards are useless, mining solo becomes the most sensible option to maximise profit while minimising risk, and doing that alone is more boring than watching paint dry, so naturally, going afk becomes preferable. getting people to play in groups is desirable in any mmo -- it's the whole point. telling miners to fit a proper tank, when they should instead depend on other people for protection sounds counterproductive -- isn't that what the heavy industrial and mining ships are paper thin for?but what if bodyguards could actually bodyguard by shielding with their bodies? suggestions to enable that have been offered in various forms, mostly involving sharing of damage and shield directly or indirectly in some fashion, or shooting down incoming damage, some suggesting special ship types for it. however, that approach is highly problematic, because whatever protection goes on would be so universally useful, that it would drastically alter the face of combat all over, with consequences inducing a balancing nightmare.but another solution comes to mind....continued in the next post:"
6/2/2012,"let's try something a bit less universal, and individually swap the targets instead: the miner, or whichever other industrial target needs protecting, equips an active mid slot ewar module, called lock redirector. lock redirector may only be fitted onto industrial and mining ships, requires a special skill to use and has a 10 second reactivation timer, but can cycle indefinitely once turned on, as long as there's cap. the bodyguard equips another high slot module, called lock beacon. lock beacon cannot be fitted onto anything bigger than a battlecruiser - in fact, requires a battlecruiser or a command ship, being a special warfare link module, and requiring leadership skills to use. a lock beacon balloons the sig of the user not unlike an mwd, and possibly even higher. this penalty is always active. lock redirector needs to be activated on a target ship in the same fleet, (which obviously needs to be locked first) that has a fitted lock beacon. it has a very short range, say, under 5km. the skill may boost this range up to 10km at level v. while lock redirector is active on a lock beacon, the lock beacon ship suffers a penalty to ship agility. one lock beacon may be the target of multiple lock redirector signals, but staying within their respective ranges is their problem. the aforementioned penalties to ship agility stack.any attempt to lock the target equipped with an active lock redirector will instead lock the ship with the lock beacon it's activated on, using the (penalised!) sig of that ship -- what you click the target button on is the miner, but what your computer instead ends up locking is his bodyguard. npc rats, drones, fof missiles, anything except player ships themselves is immune to this effect.expected results of the introduction of these two modules are as follows:it is actually feasible to shield a weak high value target with a harder, lower value bodyguard, but keeping the protection up requires concerted action and attention from participants, lest they drift out of range. miners need to come with bodyguards to be safe (or at least splurge for an extra alt - and since it needs a battlecruiser, they can't use a free trial account either) and mining under guard becomes a considerably more tactically complicated affair that is feasible in wider range of sec status systems, hopefully making everyone a bit less bored. suicide ganking in highsec does not become impossible, nobody becomes invulnerable - killing protected targets is merely more tactically difficult regardless of location. you will need to use smartbombs, which don't require a target lock, or ecm bursts, which break lock redirector locks on the bodyguard, or you can bump the protection targets out of range of their bodyguard -- who has an agility penalty and can't easily maneuver to keep up. you can simply endeavour to kill the bodyguard fast enough, and attacking protected targets becomes considerably more interesting and challenging. killing unprotected targets remains as trivial as it was, if they can't find anyone to guard them, too bad. this set of modules does nothing for freighters, which can't fit modules in the first place, or combat ships, which cannot be protected in this fashion because they can't fit the lock redirector. at the same time, it enables escorting a smaller industrial with a ship that can actually protect it, disincentivising using freighters when protected smaller ships can do better....meh, who am i kidding, it's the forums, when's the last time people supported anything constructive..."
6/2/2012,"i like the idea of some way to ""take a bullet"" for another ship."
6/2/2012,"the problem i see with this, is it isn't worth the effort required to do this. you would either have to get other players involved who are willing to babysit your miner, and they probably aren't going to want to do it without pay. it's going to be quite a boring task for both parties (mining is already boring, and so is watching someone mine). the income of mining would make this un-worthwhile. the other option is using an alt. this would require that the miner be actively paying attention to what's going on in order to be effective, which miners don't do now because of the income of mining. i think the only possible issues with mining right now, are the facts that it's very boring, and very low income.as a result mining is usually done semi-afk. this isn't a very big issue as long as it can continue to be done semi-afk with low risk. and it's very possible to do so, if you take the time to find a system that isn't likely to be traveled by gankers, or find a belt to mine in where you're not likely to be the target of choice. i think mining could use a little bit of work, but overall as long as it can be done semi-afk with low risk, which it can, then it's not something that needs to be completely overhauled. i do think mining could use an income boost. but i also think that changes have already been made that will bring an income boost to miners. it will just take some time before the effects of these changes are fully realized."
6/2/2012,"i mostly agree with this statement, but the biggest benefit of the proposed system isn't that highsec mining becomes safer, (it does, but whether it's worth the expense is very situational) but that it will enable practical mining in cases where it would be an unsustainable risk otherwise, i.e. well-traveled lowsec. a mining op into lowsec with ships guarded in this manner will greatly increase the probability of survival of mission critical income-generating ships, get people in combat ships for extended periods into known static locations, i.e. belts, and ensure fights not unlike fw plexing in it's current incarnation does -- you need to stick around the complex beacon to gain your reward, and your opponent needs to kill you first before they can push the beacon the other way.similarly, when you're guarding your miners in a lowsec belt, a gang of pirates warping in on you can't lock them until they ecm burst them off you or kill you, and the miners get enough time to warp off, while you can't run yourself, and by the time you can, you're pointed down."
6/2/2012,"first, i would like to say thank you. your someone who recognises their is a problem with the way high sec suicide ganking works and how it doesn't really fit into the way combat in eve works. your also someone who recognises high sec shouldn't be safe and carebears dont need some drastic change to to their safety, but rather something subtle. you dont often get these two qualities from posts about this particular subject.im going to tentitively say that i like the idea in theory. but i can't help but think there might be a slightly simpler way of accomplishing this. the idea of having two differant mods on two seperate ships in order for them to have their desired effect seems odd to me somehow. probably because there is nothing in eve that i can think of that works in this way already.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
6/2/2012,"simpler solution? revoke concord protection for ganker, permanently. separate from sec status. as long as sec is not low, faction police will not harass you. you'll just live without concord protection."
6/2/2012,"well, let me explain my logic in detail, and maybe you'll offer a better alternative somewhere:1. the problem with suicide ganking isn't that it's possible, and isn't even that miners are the most common target -- it's that mining and industrial ships have very low hp, suggesting that they need protection, but such protection is impossible to render because of how game mechanics works. there are ways to punish the assailant, but no way to offer a reasonable chance to prevent the loss anywhere except the strictly controlled nullsec space, which restricts industrial gameplay in general to where npcs at least provide very, very certain punishment, or to where players can lock down the entire system. it's not that nobody mines in lowsec, it's that too few people do so. that is, the real problem isn't the high sec concord mechanics, and isn't the low ehp of industrial ships, but how they all interact with the damage mechanics.industrial players need to be able to calculate risk and bet on surviving after having taken measures to do so, like everyone else can. from the general mmo design logic, it is far more desirable for these measures to involve other players. once it can be done, they won't restrict themselves to highsec anywhere so much, and there's lots of incentives in lowsec already, more fun for everyone, no need for extra universe.2. sharing or preventing the actual damage easily creates a balancing nightmare and can make industrial players simply invulnerable, which is no fun. switching the target to a harder ship is a sweet spot -- it mitigates risk, but can be countered by specific fits and tactics at specific tradeoffs. most industrial ships tank with their mids, lows taken by mission-critical modules they shouldn't need to sacrifice, a mid slot for this ability to share someone else's tank sounds right. this module should be active, directed at a specific ship, and limited at the very least to the same grid for obvious reasons. limiting it's distance so that the target and the bodyguard have to huddle together enables specific counter-tactics -- makes it feasible to bump them out of range or smartbomb them both, requiring the module to be activated on a target makes ecm burst a specific counter. making rats immune to it simplifies programming and ensures that industrial ships can't get away with bodyguard as their only tank.3. it should be impossible to exploit this mechanic to become untargetable at the expense of an unaware third party or otherwise misuse it -- unintended consequences can be gamebreaking, someone will find a way to pollute the sanbox into uselessness otherwise. bodyguard must be very aware of his role in the team and it's consequences. however, it is desirable that the bodyguard needs no extra interface elements for it -- that is easier to code. this is easiest to accomplish by making him fit a module too and requiring both ships to be in the same fleet, which takes care of all confirmations required. this module can be passive, so the bodyguard doesn't have to worry about it.4. it should be possible for the bodyguard to survive an overwhelming assault for long enough to offer his charges a reasonable chance to warp out, (what this mechanic really does is not preventing damage to them, but preventing them from being pointed while they align) but it should also be possible (but hard) to bring enough firepower to just crush them all sufficiently fast. cruiser hulls are generally too weak for the purpose, and baiting battleship builds can offer truly silly amounts of ehp on par with structures, so battlecruiser sized hulls are the sweet spot. making the receiving module a high slot warfare link module seems logical then, since those hulls are meant for them in the first place. it shouldn't be possible to fit it into a capital ship, but that's obvious -- no need for capships at this party, it's for small gangs.5. ballooning sig radius of the bodyguard ensures that the bullet they take for their charges actually hits the mark, and adjusting the exact penalty value can be used to fine-tune the whole equation to desired survivability of the bodyguard under fire so that the charges can warp off with a desired known probability if a known amount of dps shows up. it also has the side effect of making the mechanic useful to guard a hauler -- hauler needs to be able to lock use the redirector module on it quickly for this, sig ballooning will take care of that. agility penalty is a roundabout soft limit on the number of charges a bodyguard can handle simultaneously -- the less agile they are, the harder it is for the charges to keep range while they do their thing, so you can't reasonably protect too many ships with just one battlecruiser. lockout timer on the redirector module penalises piloting errors and afk playing.i wanted to be thorough when formulating this. :)"
6/2/2012,"well reasoned. i still cant see any problems or holes in it. it covers almost everyones concerns. as such you have my full support. having said that, i still believe the problem can be sorted by adding more dire consequences to suicide ganking.not quite this harsh though. ^^""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"

(gankers have zero risk since they are after all planning to blow up their own ships in exchange for the tears and loot of those who do actually risk their expensive ships). i'd say, just make them kos for a full 24 hours ... and give everyone a nice blinky warp-to point that follows them around."
6/2/2012,"i hate concord.that being said, i think the solution to eve's problem of law and unlawful balancing should take a look to freelancer and freelancer mods. freelancer has both trading and combat, it's an excellent game to play if per say, your waiting for your battleship skills to train and you just can't take thinking about piloting it anymore...i think interdiction should be easier, and more player involved. i think it should become more frequently able, usable, etc by npc's and pvp. to counter this there should be certain specific this can be done, such as a ""deep space communication relay"" that a player/unlawful npc used to ""amplify interdiction signals"".these locations are static, generally halfway in between major locations/hubs (ie;in between a gate and a station). the higher the security, the higher the likelihood and strength of lawful npc groups, and the lower the security the lower frequency but higher intensity fights. the fights in lower security would really depend on players attempting to fly in between locations and their pirate counterparts, which would be inevitable.in addition to being easier to interdict, it should also be noted some sort of anti-warp scrambling device should most likely be added, much less paralyzing compared to warp stabilizers, which kill your range ridiculously much.as is concord really doesn't do anything in my opinion, except stop the flow of the game in a more logical, cop vs robber mentality, a constant ""good vs evil"" which should naturally happen is somehow relegated relatively to corporations and alliances. i really don't enjoy the thought of you either die or you don't die. i often feels like there's not enough gray area and complexity in eve's warp/navigation in between systems. you aren't really forced to meet pirate scum unless they are camping at gates, which i think should start to be discouraged by lawful races by fighting, not ""omg concord concord"" boom... or ""boom take the plex'sconcords coming!"" whew, we escaped. if concord is so strong it's a really, really bizarre universe."
6/2/2012,"i believe concord is there to enforce ethics and morals in hi-sec. which means the players do not have to create and enforce their own ethics and morals.i could see the idea of removing concord, it makes everyone fair game.then people start realizing that if they want to get in something more than an ibis, they will actually have to setup their own game ethics and morals and actually think about not shooting each other."

6/3/2012,thanks for the input and support! still working on the rest of the design sketches.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
6/3/2012,"i agree completely with philomatheus.also, this is not merely about graphics. as philomatheus and others have mentioned, it's about broken travel mechanics. anyone who has played other space-sims is probably liable to be extremely perturbed by this games travel mechanics, even ignoring visuals. also i'm sorry but the warp tunnels don't really impress me, i would prefer a ""warp"" graphics effect more closely to freelancer gates, starlancer warp, etc."
6/3/2012,"damn it that isn't progress, progress would be a likeness and include tats!supported"
6/3/2012,"can someone please lock this ****ing thread for lack of content? seriously, all it is is carebear *****ing and then mindless, whining bull**** of unrelated nature.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
6/3/2012,"so mr invincible, how do you deal with gankers who use an orca or cloaked battleship to bump you off warp? remember they know where you are, and where you are going (you're aligned, any cloaked scout can see)... all they need is a bookmark in the right place and mass, directly between you and your destination. personally we've been looking at combat orca fits to kill bomber squadrons, but that's null sec fun and games. bottom line, you seem to think there is a way to be perfectly safe mining. that, if you believe the counterarguments, would be as wrong from a game design point of view as it is simply not true. bumping someone off their warp alignment happens right before the alpah strike warps in, and the ship bumping is not flagged in any way. that does not mean they didn't just get you killed, however ;pcarebears pay us$ and buy plex to play. be nice to the sheep - you can only have so many wolves and so few sheep before the wolves get very hungry and bored. oh wait, they already got so bored in null that they invented hulkageddon to give themselves something to do! gee, guess the game is at its zenith of pvp, huh? ;p"
6/3/2012,"hulk is already in warp by the time the bs gets out of warp. i'll add in mining well away from the warpin point and leaving a can over at it to decloak too if you like.i am well aware that if someone wants me dead, i already am. there are, however, steps that can be taken to make it harder for them. wasting a smartbomb bs on one solitary hulk instead of a swarm of macks in any ice field you like? that's one of those ways. it won't deter someone who's determined to get me and me alone, but honestly, it's not about making my hulk invulnerable, it's about making the guy want to shoot yours instead."
6/3/2012,perhaps 1 billboard at each gate/station.you pay to display it so many times an hour. rates go up depending on jumps in system.
6/3/2012,"i'm very much for the idea of advert prices scaling with the average populations of systems. either that, or some kind of bidding system like the buy order system, where your adverts display a certain amount depending on how far down the auction rank you are. with either of these two options, imagine the isk sink from the adverts in jita. we would really see who the 1% were that way."
6/3/2012,"i believe that the use of shortcuts is beneficial to game immersion and reduces impacts on ui changes.it also allows you to reach to your objective much faster than with all those mouse clicks on the windows.i'd like to suggest:shortcuts for corp hangarscurrently there are no shortcuts to open corporate hangars.there should be a way to set a shortcut to open a specific corporate hangar tab (one of those 7).also, in space, this shortcut would open the closest corporate hangar bay which is not in your current ship.different shortcuts should also be available for opening the corporate hangar tabs of your current ship.the servers stores your shortcuts configmake a way to store the client shortcuts settings in the servers.it is a pain to re-config all shortcut settings after a new game release + full install.many other client configs could also be stored in the servers, but this discussion belongs to another thread.ps: i have eve installed on 3 different computers, which scales this problem proportionally.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
6/3/2012,interesting --> inventory shortcuts?
6/3/2012,but why created cpu rigs when that's is unuseable ?
6/3/2012,"true. a lot of caldari ships need some love. but i am focused on the kestrel right now and since ccp is rebalancing frigates, they need to take a look at the kestrel."
6/3/2012,"i am just wondering how another mid slot which uses more powergrid can help other than tanking.i mean it's really designed for kiting i think, it's how i always did 1/2 missions till i got a hookbill."
6/3/2012,supported. +1
6/3/2012,"i agree, somewhat:why only for cloaking, what about a sound for the end of session timers like aggression etc. or when your hold is full of ore; for when research is complete.it would be great to be able to add sound alerts to events - a tool to select the sound and add it to the event would be a fine addition but it should be client side, like your overview setting.a neat object oriented tool to add sound alerts, but why get so complex?the game is so broad, you don't want to open the floodgates cluttering the gui. simply have an elegant tool with conditionals that filter the events only setting off an alert when the match is found."
6/3/2012,supported - this has no effect on afk cloakers and simply fixes a ui issue.using overview is also a great idea ---> after they get rid of the limit on having no more than 5 overview tabs (another horrible interface issue that needs fixing).
6/3/2012,i agree it should be allowed. watching a missile go from point a to point b in a cerberus max range vollet (250km) must be truly amazing...
6/3/2012,thanks. it may not be the most important thing on ccp's plate but hopefully they can multitask.

6/4/2012,let's get some more support!i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
6/4/2012,"this thread is going places.i have an easy solution to deal with an afk cloaker.... move your ratting/mining to another system. if the afk cloaker moves with you he is no longer afkthat was the pro-tip of the day, now stop whining and learn how to adapt to the game and other players in the game. dont demand that ccp change the game because you are bad at eve."
6/4/2012,well placed bubbles always make a mining op safer out in nullsec.
6/4/2012,"this. ^^if your not comfortable moving from the system they're in to another one to do your ratting, mining etc, then you really shouldn't be out of highsec.to be honest, im not flatly against some kind of mothed of reducing the effect of afk cloakers in systems. i just think all the suggestions made so far are terrible. i also think most of you are crying over spilt milk, afk cloakies has always been a part of game-play for me. never really done it myself, but i've always had to deal with them. i've layed traps for and killed three of them, and never been killed by one.i've also carried on with life in system as usual most of the time, because we have standing fleets and lots of people active in system usually. (admittedly, not where i am now).""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
6/4/2012,"actually, the afk tag isn't a bad idea, other than the fact that it is easily circumvented."
6/4/2012,this!!!!!
6/4/2012,idea looks great - be nice to have a reason to actually use a proc in this game.+1
6/4/2012,"and there isn't crazy isk to me made by mining mercoxit? the point doesn't make sense as to why the strips aren't added to the game, its simply a missing module that appears to have been overlooked by ccp, in exchange for bigger, faster glass cannons, aka grief boats. hulk - ore king v2covetor - ore king v1mackinaw - ice king v2retriever - ice king v1skiff - mercoxit king v1procurer - useless pos as even with t2 strips and t2 crystals a rokh out mines you..."
6/4/2012,"no matter how crazy isk you get by mining mercoxit, you can't compete with isk produced by harvesting c32 in a destroyer.and you want to increase that even more?mind you i live in place where c32 is actually common - and i am against it.i've decided to put some numbers down just for the kicks:with your ""strip gas harvester ii"" i will be able to get approx 690 million isk / hourthat's right - using one strip harvester i will be getting close to 700mil, throw in the prorator bonus you've mentioned: 1,300,000,000 isk/hr, mining barge bonus: 1,500,000,000 isk/hrshould i also calculate fleet bonuses? or you get the picture?"
6/4/2012,"i'd love a scanning aspect to mining. fully support this proposal. thanks eidric for you careful and well thought out post.please see link for more along the same lines.thanks for doing this for us all,"
6/4/2012,"thank you for your comments. unfortunately this project of mine was a bit rushed - i was about midway in finalizing it when i heard about upcoming summit. as such i've tried putting this on forums so csm would be able to see this before they head out.i did look at the link and only thing i slightly disagree with is on board scanner - since it will allow bots to continue working as they are now. until the scanner would start to require precise direction to achieve results it will remain bot-friendly.i would also like to stress out that the sites have to be large but despawn quickly - in such a way that single hulk will not mine out the entire site before it despawns. reason - it allows formation of mining fleets similar to incursion design - come in fast mine at incredible rates and move out. even in hi-sec, that way the new players will have an incentive to actually form fleets and socialize more. they are not punished by going alone but rewarded while coming as a team."
6/4/2012,"agreed - later on in that thread there was a consensus that the d-scan option wasn't viable and that these mining sites should need to be scanned down.it adds support to your proposal: there has already been some debate here and a probe option was considered very strong for finding ""belts""."
6/4/2012,bidding on time slots for the boards i like that idea. it would make it an isk seek but keep it competitive at the same time. also set a the base bid price by the average traffic in the same system over a set time frame.
6/4/2012,"i did mention to greyscale at fanfest that, while the drone alloys were breaking other aspects of the economy, the drone regions did at least have their own unique niche, and that if some other possibility came up for new types of npc-dropped materials that the drone regions should be prime candidates for it.since as everyone knows goons control eve and ccp these days you should expect something very soon."
6/4/2012,the problem i see with this is that majority of the population will cluster around one region.... cough.... forge... cough.
6/4/2012,that'd never happen. (edit: this is a sarcastic comment btw).
6/4/2012,"how is wanting to change the whole system of jetcan mining exploit, in the miners favor, accepting the risk of jetcan mining?fyi, if someone takes something out of my trashcan, and i decide i want it back, break into their home and take it. guess whos going to jail? jetcans can be seen as garbage cans. they belong to you and everything inside technically belongs to you, but can be assumed to be up for grabs, as you show that you no longer want it. in all seriousness, jetcan mining is risky, for all the reasons mentioned in the op. as others have pointed out, there are better ways to go about mining."
6/4/2012,"i have known jet can mining is dangerous since shortly after starting playing eve. its just a fact of life.if you want to solve this problem and a couple of other, suggest a new larger secure container. the giant secure container is pathetic, and we could use a bigger one. this would partially solve your problem, and we'd get useful secure containers.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
6/4/2012,"oh my god, yes. giant secure containers are far too small."
6/4/2012,"welcome to eve the only real sandbox mmo on the market right now. eve could be saidt to slightly resemble the lawless wild west. if you get somthing and others can steal it the law will always have better things to do than help you.on the other hand you are giver the card blanch to shoot the crap out of them. it all boils down to ""carebear smarter not harder""so if you want to make sure people dont steat your ore use secure cans, an orca alt, a industrial alt or warp to station when cargo is full and unload.ohhhh and if you thought eve was safe you where told wrong..... it is never safe deal with it, the rest of us have."
6/4/2012,you can still use cpu rigs.... the calibration cost on them might have somthing to do with halacing in regarts to the fitting you coul make otherwise... just saing.
6/4/2012,"no. just because they don't behave how you want them to and just because you can't see the justification in their calibration cost does not mean it's like that ""for no good reason"". i suspect ccp determined that stacking them they way you do acrs allowed unintended fits, and adjusted calibration accordingly."
6/4/2012,"i'd like to see the <U+FFFD>turrets size to ship<U+FFFD>-dilemma adressed. seriously.its a waste we now have all those new turret/launcher-models made for ship hulls with very old hardpoint designs, sincethey don't look believable in their size and features. it is not so bad on many smaller ships but even there difficulties arise.i like seeing ccp putting effort in the visuals of the game - maybe i'm just a lil bit different because i like the 'cinematic effect' of eve and sadly i must say they did a rushed job in my opinion. their aim was to implement new turrets into the game that looked better, flashier, but they had to fail because they were restricted by the old ship models.i can see how it must've been very difficult to get everything right on every ship because it has to be modular, but this resulted in exact this look: every turret/launcher looks like its glued on the ship, they have all the same size, which looks rediculous. their placement needs to be considered so they can shoot the target immediately i click on fire, which also adds problems. it's time for a real overhaul of the ship creation process to make things faster while creating them and more forgiving in future changes that will come, i.e. new t2 versions.i'd like to see these things reconsidered: turret size -> ww2 had bigger guns then eve compared to ship size turret/launcher placing on ship hulls -> be... creative but not stupid? a way to make them less look like 'glued on' -> give them a 'buried in' look sensible turret designs -> spinning rims on my ac? be daring -> let others work for you this is something that's not feasible in a half a year and needs many working hours in the the design department and drawingboard, but they are updating ship after ship anyway and i think they could do this at the same time and get a better result in the end from the playerbase. support this idea if you think its worthwhile breaking out of the detached developing circle they are doing now! ships and turrets need to be looked at together! i don't want a bone or two every now and then. i'd rather starve and then get some juicy meat instead of many bones only."
6/4/2012,"+1 this makes sense a basic prox warning is more than need, especially when your overview settings need to be reviewed in detail every minor patch now. as to the cloak whiners get a clue the mod is here to stay deal with it, that said, afk cloakers are ca"
6/4/2012,"yes, some more audio notifications in general would be nice.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
6/4/2012,"hello folks. i don't like to start threads in the assembly hall unless an idea is well thought through and the problem it addresses is obviously a problem. having said that there are some very simple ui changes that could make corp ceo and directors' life much much easier, so i'll detail them below. i'm not going to go into detail about how horrible the the corp management ui is in general, i just want to talk about some low hanging fruit that has been annoying me recently.corp adverts:at the moment corp adverts expire, and sit in the corp ads tab. if you want a new corp add and were happy with the way the last one was set up you have to delete the old one and create a new one that is identical to the old ad. a simple ""renew"" button should be added where expired ads can be put back up. this has bothered me for some time, because i try and keep the max 3 adverts running at all times. what should be done with one click takes quite some time to set up again. i'll probably be adding to this list once i get back in game and spotting more. i'll post to let you know of the op gets updated. if you have any suggestions please post them up. remember to stick to low hanging fruit please. easy fixes.let me know what you think guys."

6/5/2012,"yeah, would be nice. there's also other agents that need looked at as well. cosmos agents - need to display the correct standing requirement for access in their agent info. they should also issue a warning message to players stating if mission is declined, it won't be offered again. that message should appear with a yes/no option each time a player 'declines' a cosmos mission offer...avrue auz - agent listed on the certificate gained at gallente data centers, gives players an item, avrue's token, for completing her missions, that item is supposed to be given to another agent, boismevier mals, for continuing the chain..however, that agent isn't available thus the chain is broken, er unfinished.patch notes for apocrypha, released 10 march 2009 :item description for avrue's token now :jeremy tacs - 1 of 2 concord agents left in game that offers a mission for security status increase. that mission offer was recently deactivated due to a bug allowing players to farm his mission. cosmos bpc's - these need to be redone, such as lowering the amount of special materials required that's listed on the bpc's or at least make those special materials more readily availablestoryline modules - these need to have their attributes increased to correctly represent their meta level. as it is right now, most storyline modules are equal to meta level 3 modules yet the storyline modules are listed as meta level 6 or 7.anyway, there's other issues as well. the event agents, their missions and their rewards definitely need some ccp love and attention."
6/5/2012,no way!!! but afk tag on local is fine.
6/5/2012,"afk tags wont fix anything, because alot of afk cloakies looking to kill people will sit in an anomaly waiting for someone stupid to turn up and then kill them. it will say they are afk but they can still see when you turn up. if your running an anomaly that a cloaky went afk in you will still get no warning before they attack you, because they wont be ""not-afk"" until they move the mouse to uncloak and attack you. also you could just jam something in the keyboard and the afk tag wont show up.not only that but the afk tag will cause problems. suicide ganking in highsec will become easier, for example. ""that freighter who is autopiloting is also afk, easy target"" or ""that hulk pilot is afk, he'll never see us coming"". if you want to support these kind of changes then go ahead, but you wont get my support. it also detracts from info-gathering and the normal tactics associated with pvp. if someone is looking for fights in null, sees a system with one person in space on the map, and jump into that system to see 12 people in local, they will wonder if they can pull off a kill without people turning up to support them. with an afk tag they will instantly see the other 11 arn't going to come to the person in space's aid.also, it just doesn't make sence to have afk tags from a lore perspective. gates control local chat, the information is given out by them. how exactly do you justify a gate knowing whether the pilot of a ship in local is paying attention? answer is, you dont, because you can't.afk cloakies have never been a problem to me, because we have always had systems in place to deal with them. if you cant deal with them, then you shouldn't be where the afk cloakies are. also, i am getting fed up with people replying to my posts without reading what i have written or putting together sensible arguements. please think before you hate, thank you.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
6/5/2012,this!!!
6/5/2012,"i'd really like to see a better way to manage wormhole operations. a pos is a really crappy way to live in a wormhole and they aren't really meant to be lived out of. a pos as it currently stands is geared towards 'corp/alliance' operations, not for individuals.what i would like to see is something similar to an outpost like in null sec. wormholes are completely lawless just like sov null sec space, so why can't we claim sovereignty in them? put up a tcu and an ihub to work on the systems and make them better, even place a scaled down version of an outpost at a planet, possibly multiple small outposts so that multiple corps in an alliance could own them.as of right now it is a nightmare for individuals to live in a corp pos. there is no individual storage, you can't repackage items so you are forced to look at 20 of the same thing when scrolling through a hangar, and so much more. it really gets frustrating sometimes the bs you have to go through because of an outdated system ccp **should** have updated before they even released wormhole space to begin with - yet another example of stacking **** on top of **** for an even bigger pile of ****.even if we can't get outposts, can we at least get new pos modules? larger corp hangar arrays? the ability to have personalized space in them and a way for a ceo/director to be able to take the stuff out if need be to remove the array from space? there are some good ideas out there for other arrays for pos's and i think ccp should strongly take a look into this.i've played with wormhole space back and forth and it is really hard to stay commited to it and bring other pilots in when we still for years have an outdated system not brought up with the times of the game.fix it please. somehow, just make it more workable for individual members of a corp, not just the corp itself."
6/5/2012,"nice. this is bang on the money. talking of which. . . . why is it in eve an industrial mining ship costs more than a battle cruiser? a civilian ship will get blown up by a warship but. . .queen mary 2 cost 460 million for 1 in 2003. she is a massive vessel. not much armour, not really any at all. nice cabins though. very large ship.discoverer enterprise, cost nearly us$430 million 1997 is an industrial drilling ship. massive. again not much armour. but good a drilling holes in the sea floor for industrial purposes.sauipem 7000 one of the worlds largest crane ships. massive industrial vessel. 400million usd in 1986.covetor industrial mining ship 22 mil isk. pretty standard mining ship.compare.type 45 destroyer cost: you get two for 6.46 billion so 3.2 billion each in 2007. it's called a destroyer but it's quite big for a destroyer.rupture pretty standard cruiser 10 million isk.if in eve, as in my real world examples above, industrials where to cost 1/6th the cost of a cruiser then miners could have a covetor for 1.6 million isk and might even risk taking it into lo-sec or wouldn't mind so much losing one in hi-sec."
6/5/2012,an offline pos should just deanchor after a certain amount of time. it's the simplest thing to implement. i do like the other ideas of hacking etc it would put my explorer char to great use but i feel that the complexity would require too much time to implement. once fuel runs out the reserve power that is holding the anchor would just disengage. the old pos would stay in orbit decay and become wreckage.

6/5/2012,"why is it that only one character per account can train at any given time. it rather defeats the purpose of having an alt character if you have to put you main character on developmental hold to train your alt. i'm not sure if this has been brought up before, and maybe there is a reason behind the policy, but i currently fail to understand it.let all characters on an account train simultaneously!!"
6/5/2012,"people pay for seperate accounts to train new alts. this will never be introduced because ccp would lose a massive massive amount of income. please think your ideas through, or know more about the game, before suggesting to change it in the assembly hall.if your generally that experienced but still think your suggestion may be worth while, post it in the features and suggestions area of the forums first to see people's reactions.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
6/5/2012,"people having multiple accounts would not be greatly affected by this, as you may only have one character online, per account, at a time.many (maybe most) players have multiple accounts, with characters logged on simultaneously for any number of reasons.for example, mission ship / command ship team running missions; hulk / orca mining teams. the are many reasons to have multiple accounts online at any given time.allowing 'alt characters' on any given account to be training in 'offline mode' would not necessarily create a huge drop in the number of 'alt accounts' that many players require."
6/5/2012,show me a game where you are allowed to train multiple characters on the same account at the same time.
6/5/2012,"if you want to compare and contrast eve online with other games, then why don't you show me another game that allows you to train your characters when you aren't even logged in?"
6/5/2012,"the search thingy at the top of the forum is really helpful, you know. you can search for subject matter such as ""training"" and ""account"" and see just how many times this has been brought up and repeatedly shot down by the eve community, all in one place!all in one place!"
6/5/2012,"well, if the subject keeps popping up, that should indicate that there is popular support for it, and it is worthy of further discussion.simply pointing to the fact that it has been discussed, and summarily dismissed in the past, doesn't necessarily mean that it is a dead-end conversation. i appreciate that fact that you (and some others) think it is a bad idea. duly noted, however there may be quite a few that think it is a good idea.if everybody in eve online had the, ""that's the way it is, and you have to deal with it"" attitude; bob would still be in control of the galactic southwest."

6/5/2012,"i agree on some of the turrets dont actually look like turrets.before the turret implementation, laser turret (large ones) looked like fishball on a stick attached to ship, while being pretty plain, they do look like a turret.after the turret implementation, large laser turrets dont really look like a turret when attached to amarr boats, instead they look like fire hydrants or sumthing like that. it only appeared to be ""apparently its a turret"" when u click on the item description icon and get a close up animated view of said turret."

6/5/2012,+1 to this.
6/5/2012,in the very same window you can see the exact time the person has last logged in and out.
6/5/2012,"well, now i feel silly.i'll amend the op to just focus on the first issue."
6/5/2012,"the npc corporation you are thinking of is called 'ded'. they are the in game police that are supposed to deal with the worst of the worst criminals in eve. if concord are like the nypd then ded would be the fbi. if you look under 'station services' in your map you will notice one of the services is 'bounty hunter missions'. yet there are no bounty hunter missions! the bounty hunter button on the station interface doesn't do much, except list those pirates with the biggest bounties. yes i agree. the best way to stop or at least discourage the 'killing yourself with an alt' exploit is to have the ded corporation give out bounty hunting missions as well as an earnable bounty hunting license. in order to get the bh license you would have to grind your standings by doing bounty hunting missions on npc pirates. player pirates won't do this, but those who want to be professional bounty hunters will. once you have finished your level 4 ded stroryline missions, you get access to ded 'tracker agents' (i.e. locator agents) who not only give you the name of a player pirate with a bounty, but tell you what systems they have been in. this would be a lot like research agents who do research for you once you gain high enough standings.i also think that the reward should be based on the bounty's skillpoints, and not visible in their profile. i also think that the bounty's skillpoints should be matched with the bounty hunter's skillpoints as much as possible, to ensure an even fight. i also think kill rights should be transferable. in most cases they are useless to a player with low skillpoints if someone ganks them. my suggestion is that you could 'file a complaint' with ded. for a small fee. once ded gets enough of these complaints, they put out a bounty on the person. that bounty could go to the ded 'tracker agents', who could hand them out like starbase charters."
6/5/2012,"this fixes all the loopholes in the currenty system.and this makes a bounty hunting into a viable profession. if the first of those two linked proposals is implemented, and then the second is then implemented aftwards as a seperate system, all problems and loopholes in either are fixed, and the profession works as it should. this has been discussed thouroughly in the second thread ("

6/6/2012,"again we are asking for a no risk situation, tho.to be immune to risk is bad for the game."
6/6/2012,"well how about nooooo.living in w-space nets you way more isk than living in normal 0.0risk vs. reward, have you ever heard about that in eve?so if you want to live in w-space you have to live from a pos deal with it."
6/6/2012,"although i support the suggestion completely, it seems a waste to even start a thread about it, because ccp are already publically commited to re-working poses from the ground up."
6/6/2012,"how about yes. living in a pos is not the issue of risk, it is the issue of functionality. poss adequately abbreviates what it is like to live out of one, a piece of ****.having a small outpost or specialized/better/new pos arrays does not negate the risk vs reward - this is purely to enhance the gameplay in wormhole space.if you have a pos with upgraded/better/new arrays or a smaller version of an outpost(or even normal sized ones) does not tinker with risk vs reward a bit. both can be destroyed/taken over. please post when you actually have something worth posting.to the ladder poster, if ccp publically announced they are going to rework them, then let them take this into consideration and think about wormhole life not *just* from a corp/alliance perspective(as i said before they seem to be mainly for corp/alliance industry) but from the perspective of a member of a corporation/alliance. giving them their own personal spaces for ships/items without making pos's undefendable because of power/cpu requirements.how about extra large towers?oh i know what you are going to say - so someone can put up an even bigger dickstar or deathstar around a jumpbridge/cyno jammer or whatever else. well how about up the power/cpu requirements of those modules then so that these setups are not possible on large towers anymore and null sov holders are forced to use these extra large towers instead of normal large towers.somethings gotta give on this. not everyone is comfortable having all their stuff stuffed into a tab where others can access it and not everyone wants their ships accessible to everyone.poss are inadequate for wormhole life. if ccp is doing something about poss in general or looking at wormholes in general, this would be a good place to start."
6/6/2012,"pos or station most definitely has something to do with risk vs. reward. blow up a pos and mods<U+FFFD> all your stuff is gone. you can<U+FFFD>t blow up a stationit might be inconvenient for you to live out of a pos but it<U+FFFD>s a choice. you want to make a ton of isk in w-space, well then you have to live out of a pos. if your don<U+FFFD>t like to call it risk vs. reward lets call it inconvenience vs. reward, dos that work better for you.the fact is that if you have your **** together you make a ton of isk in w-space all you have to sacrifice is living out of a station. there is a saying and it goes like this <U+FFFD>you can<U+FFFD>t eat your cake and keep it to<U+FFFD>"
6/6/2012,"upgrading the pos... ccp is doing that already...allow outposts or sovereignty in w-space... absolutely not... if you do, within a few months people will turn w-space into impenetrable fortresses backed up by supercaps, etc, etc, etc. transfering some of the outpost functionality (repackaging items, swapping subsystems) to a pos... that's reasonable. personal space within a pos.... maybe... i'll have to think on that."
6/6/2012,"no one ever said you couldn't blow up the outpost in wormhole space. i'm not concerned with those mechanics of the game, i am more interested in making wormhole space better. currently it is **** to live in.why not take some of the functionality out of outposts, see how much you like living in normal space? yes it is inconvenient but something could be done to improve it. if you can't see that then **** off, honestly."
6/6/2012,"wormholes are not, were never intended to be, and probably never should be ""easy"" to live in."
6/6/2012,"akatenshi isn't asking for it to be easy to live in w-space they are asking for basic features of the game that everyone in this game is able to use except those in w space, living out of a pos is for the birds, especially with more then 5 corp members and giant secure containers in corp tabs in a pos hanger isn't a solution. there should be a pos module called corporate members hanger array that gives you the ability to repack your gear , a seperate tab to store your ships and only you have access to it (view rights for security officer obviously). as the only other way to work around that is to launch your own pos in w-space and have your own tower to tend, with all the hangers, fuel and other general nonsense. oh and you actually have the corp roles to launch and anchor a pos. everyone seems concerned with the amount of isk you earn in w-space, the market drives that isk as there's no bounties or direct in pocket income on sleepers unlike 0.0 and empire rats, no missions and no station games aka marketeering.outpost / sov - definitely not, and would never support this.destroyable base - possibly would need to see stats, as w space has that added benefit of being able to limit combat by collapsing the entry point - so no white noise, -a-, goon, test blob attacks. modular pos with some w only mods - definitelyironic people launch into a troll instead of actually contributing something of worth to these forums. makes me sad to see the culture that is developing in this game.[proposal] quick changes to ore vessles & gas gear"
6/6/2012,"i agree on the pos revamp, but as many people already noticed it is currently one of the top priorities of csm and ccp.as such we dont need to voice it more that it needs to be changed - everyone knows that. what we could possibly do is suggest a possible way of what could be implemented in the pos system.about sovereignty and outposts - i am definitively against first and prefer to see pos reiterated to work as substitute for second.for the op i would suggest reading up on summit updates/fanfest videos - they should answer most of your questions."
6/6/2012,"wh space was intentionally launched and planned around not having those amenities. wh space is designed to be a team-activity where a corp/alliance is required to work as a cohesive unit in space with limited access to the amenities of k-space. that means its not easy and isn't meant to be easy, isn't meant for the 'casual' solo ratting enthusiast, and shouldn't be subject to game designs that make k-space a dull and 'easy' for the casual player.there are plenty of people that thrive in wh space by being smart and actually participating and trusting the communities that they interact with. if you have issues with that, perhaps w-space isn't for you. if you need 'easy' and 'the comforts of k-space' just to enjoy w-space, w-space really isn't the place you should be."
6/6/2012,"not asking it to be easy, asking for a broken system to be fixed.i'm merely putting suggestions on the table and all i get are troll posts. contribute or gtfo. if ccp and csm are trying to fix this and it is such a top priority then i am certainly sure they are willing to consider and look at ideas on the subject to *help* develop fixes and things that the community would like to see versus having to pull something out of their asses and *hope* that it works or will be received well by the community.that being said, if you can't contribute then stfu.i've seen lots of posts suggesting that poss need a fix and these are some of the fixes that could help. new arrays for poss specifically driven for wormhole space living.so here is an idea, wormhole only modules. modules that are adapted specifically for wormhole living. in normal k space you won't really need some of these modules. possibly even special towers for wormhole space. increased cpu/powergrid and possibly larger fuel bays are something i can think of just for new towers in wormhole space. if you intend to live in a wormhole frequent logistics runs are not always possible while you run ops and other stuff, and if you are living on the frontier should you really have to be bothered to exit into k space once a week or once a month anyways just to interact with the rest of the universe?destructible outposts could be a solution if it is too much to ask for newer and updated pos arrays or towers. i would suggest that if we go the outpost route that it be a special wormhole outpost. smaller in size than normal outposts, lesser hitpoints but including reinforcement modes just like poss and outposts. there would be no market, no bounty offices, no lp store, etc. just able to do corp hangars, personal hangars, dock, repair/refit, cq, contracts(sometimes it is useful to send a contract instead of trade/dropping in hangars etc, and it should cost at more than a fully decked out large pos but less than a normal null sec outpost to anchor/build.if we go the pos route then we definitely need to have new arrays for them. i think the arrays speak for themselves in what we need and want. and i really like the idea of a ''dry dock'' for capital ships. the capitals not technically being hidden just in an ''anchored'' state as said before. they would be visibly attached to the dry dock array and would stay there. if for whatever reason the tower goes down capable pilots could potentially steal the capital ships intact and pilot them away, or shoot and destroy them individually and the pos dry dock array itself.with new pos modules i think there will have to be some revamping of the towers though, we're adding more than corp specific modules here to towers, or do we have to put up 5 towers for all of this stuff? the corp has to have personal space(which is already addressed in corp hangar arrays and ship maint arrays) just as much as individual corp members do."
6/6/2012,"and they do many of us posted our suggestions there concerning poses in general and wh space specificallyas far as i know ccp specifically intended for wh to be dependent on k-space, that is the reason why there is no ice here. thing is at this moment wh is actually most polished part of eve with most of the stuff working as intended. all grievances that we endure are actually coming from poses being outdated."
6/6/2012,"ohhh i spend time lived out of a pos or two in my time and yes its no fun, but it was a chose to do, so no i will not **** off.... in all honesty eve is not an easy theam park game its a hardcore sandbox. if you dont like living out of a pos move out of w-space. in eve you chose and you chose to make a lot of isk in w-space, well then you also chose to live out of a pos. eve have no easy mode... deal with it son"
6/6/2012,pos management needs to be looked at. outposts in w-space? no thanks.
6/6/2012,i' e lived in w-space and yes living in a pos sucks fat monkey ****. however doing whs is ment for a corp or a alliance not for 1 person( it can be done with one person but it's hard) it never affected me to put my ship in the hanger because i trusted my corp mates not to steel my ****. now if corp hanges where ment for people to have there own little space then ccp would have made it that way to start with thats why it's called corp hangersov in whs is a no go. outposts is a no go as well. if you want your own hanger then stay in k-space or goto 0.0 and make a outpost
6/6/2012,"helllllllllllllllll nooooo. if you want to look at it that way, tell the frigging pirates off the somalian coast to stop hijacking ships in their cheap ass boats. a couple thousand dollars worth of equipment putting a huge multmillion dollar ship at risk. that is your real life example there.if you want to put it that way, combat ships should cost under a million isk versus a covetors 22m"
6/6/2012,"sure, if you don't start getting out until the guy lands ... but there's this ""directional scan"" that i keep hearing about, where you can see what's ""nearby"" (assuming you consider ""up to 14 au"" to be nearby). so, i suppose that you could watch out to say 75m km (0.5 au) and have a good chance of seeing ""weird"" stuff and gtfo before they land. granted, every system is different, and the ranges would need to be tailored to your situation.while ccp did up dessie dps, it's not like they've banned industrial characters from setting up intel channels, setting known gankers red, or doing whatever they can to keep an eye on local ... there are things that can be done, the miners just have to decide to do them.there are no ships that are ""invulnerable"" in hisec. the few capitals (and possibly supers that were dev-moved) that are there are holdovers from years ago. they're so gimped as to what they can do, that they're just trophies for the people who got one back then. think of them as an ornamental dagger or the like -- pretty, but useless. one cannot sui-gank a nyx in hisec (well, i suppose if everyone in jita turned on the nyx it *might* have been possible). furthermore, the fact that it was up there was created due to one of the recent changes to supers (drone bay?). so, it was effectively a one-time event. in day to day gameplay, one will never see supers in hisec (or in a station for that matter). while it is used by people who multibox ... it's also viable for someone flying a single account, helping out their corpies.mine's actually in the belt with me."
6/6/2012,"you've clearly missed foghail's point about the ship having no use, so why not give it one - on another note as you like to troll gas clouds have 500-5,000 gas regardless and its not as if there's 15 of them on top of each other, so yes this little boat would mine a gas cloud like an banshee but its not as if there's 100 more clouds within its 1500m range (usually max of 3 with 140km between each other long slow-boat or warp out and back in), so your troll is like saying you could potentially mine billions an hour if your [insert uber roid] never pop'd - stop talking out your arse and contribute something useful not omfg im so l33t in my destroyer, and live in w space...for anyone unfamiliar with locating and mining gas you still have to scan down a site using probes, you still have warp into the site and bookmark the clouds, and you still have the same issue of a max of 5k a cloud. the benefit of using this little bird is the hold size, the speed that it would harvest, and the potential target it would make in empire if its full of gas.i couldn't see an issue with giving this little ship a 5x bonus yield bonus then as it only has the slot for 1 gas harvester, give the strip the same stats as the gas harvester you fit to your trusty destroyer (as the skill limits it to max of 5 gas cloud harvesters anyways), or simpler yet, remove the turret requirement from the one on your destroyer and no new module needed. gas isn't an instant isk printing press either so stop making it sound as if it is, there's still towers to setup, reactions to perform, bio-reactors and those reactions, etc etc etc and that's before you have to deal with customs officers at gates, anti booster/t3 product mechanics etc. you make it sound as if your harvesting veld with an every hungry market for it get a clue. sorry in advance for hijacking the thread foghail.+1 for a good idea for a very under used ship."
6/6/2012,"please refer to my first post. i know the amounts present i wanted to point out how fast they can be mined. in terms of isk for these who never dealt with fullerites.here is time example: lets use the one that takes a lot of time to harvest - vital or instrumental sites6000 + 500 in each let us assume, that we are mining the largest cloud - 6000 units - size = 6000x10 = 60,000m3destroyer mines 20m3 x 5 = 100m3 per 40 seconds or 150 m3 per minutetotal time it takes to harvest the cloud = 6 hours and 40 minutes ( of course no one usually does it with single ship - it is normal to do it with 3-4 ships)proposed ship would harvest: 500 x 250% = 1125m3 per (120 + 25%) 150 seconds or 450 per minutetotal time to mine the cloud = 2 hours 14 minutes (now imagine if you had 3-4 of them)mind you if we calculate c32 and not c320/c540 (one used above) we will have 13 minutes for destroyer (per 5k cloud) and 4 minutes for prorator....also dont forget the fact that sleepers appear about 10-15 minutes after the site has been generated, with that in mind and 2-4 propators you will be able to clear sites before sleepers even appearand about rarity - there is very well known tactic in wh called wh collapsing. with decent team you can harvest these sites literally non-stop.that is the reason why i am against it - i am not against specialized ships i am against ""jesus"" harvesters capable of sucking everything dry in matter of seconds."

6/6/2012,"the thing about gas clouds (where your head seems to be) is that they're not even remotely close in volume to traditional mining. the volume they require to store is huge, and the actual size of the sites is not gonna support an isk/hr argument. isk/hr for 1 or 2 hours maybe, but that's it. then you have to wait until respawn. this is not a valid argument against a gas cloud harvester improvement."
6/6/2012,"relay like the idea of giving some love to the gas junkies!boosting the proc seems like a good plan, my thought is this.-make its bonus (as well as the ones it already has)1: able to fit gas strip harvesters2: barge skill: 10% bonus to cycle time per levelt2proc:1: same2: barge skill: same3: exumers skill: bonus to scriptsyour ""gas strip harvester""as a cycle time equivalent to 5 gas harvester 1s (t2 variant cycles for t2 harvesters)mines 75m3 per cycle. (t2 100m3)only fits on barges and exumersallow for scripts in the t2 varient:-gas compression: compresses gas as it is mined, 10% less space used, 5% longer to mine -gas expansion: expands the gas with inert gas,5% faster cycle,10% lass harvested-gas extraction: harvests larger amounts. 7.5% yeld, 15% more cap used per activation-gas expulsion: harvests less gas but better cap use, 10% less harvested, 15% less cap per activationname it ""siphon gas harvester"""
6/6/2012,"all of these things were discussed alot a couple of years back in a thread titled outlaw, teh support was massive. ccp ignored it.devs got a few of the more colourful lowsec leaders to form a discussion group under the direction of mynxee. we discussed things a little and when it became apparent ccp had no intention of taking any notice we left teh discussion.my corp moved to nullsec after living in lowsec for years, because many of teh things coming in made lowsec even worse, capital blobs, 'roaming' pairs of supercaps. titans in lowsec, no income etc etc etc. many of the old guard of lowsec eventually went to nullsec because to be honest there was no real reason not to. we loved lowsec. we moved out because lowsec has never had any attention given to it. fw was not the way to steer it. in itself a nice creation but that isnt what teh majority of people who lived in lowsec wanted. they wanted a unique gaem experience, as different from empire and nullsec as they are different to each other. look up outlaw on teh old forums, it would have made lowsec awesome.also.. incursion, they should be lowsec only as it is the only place they make sense from a storyline perspective and it would be a thing that draws players there."
6/6/2012,"or of course make a protection module for orcas, allows it to boost industrial and mining vessels ehp while on grid, possibly a bubble of influence type of effect where every industrial and mining ship inside that bubble has a greatly extended shield capacity. make it so it does nothing to military grade shields so doesnt affect anything except barges, exhumers and haulers.have it come at a cost, so taking up one of teh orcas boosti ng modules or something, but would allow miners to increase tehir survivability considerably. promotes teamwork (apart from of course those who run 22 ice mining accounts (but of course arnt bots1!) who could do it all themselves.)it wouldnt make ganking obsolete by any stretch of teh imagination, but would mean peopel who are serious about their mining can reduce the risk immenseley."
6/6/2012,"now that is a simpler suggestion. can the orca get warfare gang links on it? because if so, you might as well just use the one that already exists for boosting shields.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
6/6/2012,"mine in fleets.pay attention.build/buy a command tengu alt and nearly double your shield ehp. put it in a safe spot or pos shield.properly tank your hulk.deploy ewar drones instead of mining drones.done right, you can force them to bring three tornadoes to alpha a single hulk. and alpha is the only option, as a swarm of ewar drones will ruin their day if they don't get you in the first few seconds. you'll lose some yield, but that's the price you pay for security."
6/6/2012,"notice the key missing element: ""in high sec."" elsewhere, alpha usually won't be the preferred option.the above proposal makes mining ops far more feasible in low sec as well, giving people a reasonable opportunity to spread out of high sec is kind of the point."
6/6/2012,"a couple of thoughts: 1.) while gankers can bring three tornados or a dozen catalysts to gank a single hulk, that isn't the status quo. hulks can easily be tanked, and very well. i wrote an article about how to tank hulks, how to use logis, and how to counter with ewar: fighting hulkageddon. i know people that, using the tanked hulk posted in there, survived 5x catalyst suicide attempts, as well as many other flavors of gankers. i really don't understand why people feel entitled to max-yield fit their exhumers, put on civilian shield boosters for tank, and still be able to thwart a common suicide attack? nothing in eve works that way, and many of the complaints about suicide ganking come across as people having a tantrum because they lost their shiny ship in space that they think should be risk free. you can fit a tank with no mining upgrades to have 28k-36k ehp, you can fit a tank with one mining upgrade and still have 22k-28k ehp. those numbers are not using fancy faction mods, and they're what you get before standard fleet bonuses (+10%), let alone gang-links (+30%)!! 2.) your idea is very intersting, and has some promise. here are my comments on it: -- what happens if i have an industrial ship targetted, and he activates the lock redirector? -- in it's current form, this is typically useless for industrials... the lock time on industrials is quite long and the range is of the redirect modules is too limited, making it worthless for use during transit. it would only be useful for an industrial powering slowly gathering resources on grid with the lock beacon. -- in it's current form, it is useless for nullsec. nullsec travelers will bubble the entire group (since they are all close to the lock beacon), resulting in the slaughter of your entire mining party. -- it allows you to afk protect a mining fleet in highsec. one of the fundamental dilemmas in the miners vs suicide gankers battle: the miner's playstyle is pretty laid back and somewhat inattentive, whereas, to thwart pvp attacks, you need to be constantly vigilant of threats and situationally aware. this idea of yours caters very well to the miner's playstyle... -- how would this interact with aggression flags? if i'm at war with a miner, but he's protected by an npc-corp bodyguard via this system, can i attack the bodyguard without concord intervention?? i should be able to!!! some thing for thieving, kill rights, etc, etc, etc. -- i worry how easily this could be implemented, but that's up to ccp to figure out. i wonder how changes to crimewatch will interact with this... -- the redirect module should not be useable on orca's and rorquals!! -- the lock beacon penalty is too weak. i also don't like the idea of 20 hulks using one ship as the beacon... in terms of a bodyguard... they should do a good job guarding one person, or a couple... but their effectiveness should be significantly reduced when guarding many people. in a similar fashion, i'd change the penalty to the lock becon ship: something like a 15% reduction in the shield, armor, and hull resistances for every ship that uses a lock redirector on them. then, if you're guarding 10 hulks with one ship, then all it's resists will be reduced to 20% of their original value! -- the lock redirector should give the agility penalty to the ship activating the module (i.e. the hulk), not the bodyguard. was this posted in f&i first?? your idea really should be fully vetted before posted in assembly hall!"
6/6/2012,"...why would the forum prevent me from quoting more than five times, that's silly.. anyway, here's an item by item comment:lock redirector only affects targeting attempts made while it is active on a target, but does not break existing locks. this should be easier to code, less logic and edge cases to worry about. increasing the sig of the ship with the lock beacon should help with that, that was one of the reasons i thought of it, but it might be a tight balancing act -- the idea is that the first thing the industrial does upon dropping jump cloak is lock the escort with the redirector already active and waiting for the target, regardless of whether the escort got attacked or not. this gives him time to align and run if the escort did get attacked. obviously, this should happen sufficiently fast that the industrial has a decent chance to avoid getting targeted by the camp and scrammed, but can't be completely immune. yes. but, nullsec sov holders already have the option to bubble the way in or out, so if anyone is brave enough to mine in their sov space without permission, they have to deal with that, first, and if they have permission, they can bubble the gates themselves. even if they don't have permission, they can still bubble the gates, post a cloaked lookout and tell miners to run when anyone shows up, accomplishing essentially the same thing. sort of protect, yes, make immune to suicide ganking or war - no. ecm burst still works to disrupt the connection, and is not prohibited in high sec, so if anyone is foolish enough to post an afk-guarded mining gang, they'll still get suicided or killed by war targets. you indeed should be able to. but assuming the new crimewatch system, let's say that the bodyguard inherits the suspect flag of any targets it guards (that's why the lock beacon in the first place - the bodyguard should consciously agree to doing that) while the lock beacon is online. he can offline the module if he decides to drop it. war targets can be taken care of by requiring the bodyguard to be in the same corporation as well, though i'm worried that might be too restrictive... see above. indeed, and i did mention capitals, though forgot to include the orca, which is technically not a capital but an industrial command ship. i suppose that works better than what i thought originally, yes. that would make it harder for the hulk to run away though, which would defeat most of the point. maybe some other kind of penalty instead? er... no. whoops. in my defense though, i can say that this applies to quite a few other threads in here as well, so that was easy to overlook."
6/6/2012,well considering the subject has been shot to pieces several times before on this forum by the community and not ccp might give you a hint that it is in fact not the best idea ever. one might actually say that it is a minority of players that would like this change and the majority sees it as a bad idea.the fact is that its never going to happen simply because ccp would lose a crap load of subscriptions. to be fair wouldn<U+FFFD>t we all rather have ccp getting the money they need to further expand and evolve eve the game we all love.do remember that when ccp had a 9% decries in subscriptions the had to fire 20% of the staff<U+FFFD> that is one in five for those of you that didn<U+FFFD>t listen during math class.so in short (that<U+FFFD>s to late now) stop posting suggestions for game changes you haven<U+FFFD>t thought trough or just go biomass your char now.
6/6/2012,"it has been brought up before, at least once this week! here are some previous threads dealing with the issue:"
6/6/2012,"my take on the issue is this: the most scarce resource in the game is time. learning to manage your time is the most important skill you as a player can learn. learn that skill. also learn that you will never train every skill in the game: you need to specialise. industry or military is one basic dividing point: do you train to have 200-odd order limit on the market, or do you train to fly battleships? do you train to fly a widow, or fly all t1,2 & 3 cruisers? do you become a one-pilot industrial behemoth able to churn out ships at a phenomenal rate, or fly a stealth bomber with cyno 5 so you can take part in blowing up battleships at a phenomenal rate?there are already options available to you to help you ""win"" the sp ""race"". explore those options: character transfers and multiple accounts."
6/6/2012,"and yet, despite the endless ridicule from our community's aristocracy, it still keeps popping up.this is possible, yet at the same time, opponents of this idea continually point to the fact that it keeps resurfacing, on a fairly regular basis. that, in and of itself, might point to the fact that it is indeed not as unpopular as you may want to believe it is. that is your opinion, and unless you happen to be sitting in front of a crystal ball, i'll prefer to believe that my idea has merit, and may possibly be implemented.i have three accounts. one each for the three characters i play. allowing me to additionally develop characters in the two 'alt slots' on those accounts is not going to make me want to stop paying for the three accounts i have. therefore, my idea will not lead to a massive decrease in subscriptions. i have thought it through, and i've successfully, and logically, deflected every argument to my idea in this thread. will you go biomass your characters if my change is implemented? i think most likely not."
6/6/2012,"so, apparently, it's a fairly popular idea."
6/6/2012,"this is my point exactly. why can't i use the two spare slots on any one of my accounts to train up a trader character, or an industrialist character, or a logi pilot? i can, ... but only if i stop training on the main character.maybe a better argument would be ""eliminate the two alt slots on an account, and make players pay a subscription fee for every character they play.""in effect, thats what we are doing to begin with."
6/6/2012,"i don<U+FFFD>t have a crystal ball, but thing it trough. if there still isn<U+FFFD>t a bell ringing in that empty skull of yours i do suggest you take class or two in marketing, business and product development.well this subject might reappear frequently but so did the subject about missiles and delayed damage vs. turrets and instant damage. the fact that a subject is aired often doesn<U+FFFD>t make is a great subject, often it<U+FFFD>s the other way around. great proposals tend to get csm attention the first time"
6/6/2012,"the thing you seem to be missing: the idea pops up from one individual, gets maybe...10 people supporting it...and then gets laughed at and shot down by everyone else.ccp will never implement it simply because it flies in the face of the core principles of the game. the moment ccp deviates from those principles is the day the game dies (see nex store for more details!)"
6/6/2012,"let's put your suggestion in a general framework: you want to train multiple characters per account. why?-- becuase your impatient, and cant be asked to stop training on your main so you can train a second character. reasons why this might not be supported-- it doesn't really serve a real purpose. since you can cross train everything it is always quicker and more effecient to train into a new thing on your main becuase they will have support skills already. (i suppose it could allow you to play as two separate people, but then you should be using two separate accounts anyway!!! -- character farming - when you could train up multiple characters simultaneously, people would just make 2 alts and train them to do stuff then just sell em on the bazarr or irl. this would essentially devalue all characters, and really screw over current character traders (yes, there are people that earn their isk that way!). rmt'ers and previous players abused the old multi-character-training system! -- account sharing - since you could train mulitply chars on the same account, 2 or 3 people could effectivly play the same account if they all did so at different times.finally, you really need to research your ideas before posting them. quit stinking up the assembly hall with recycled craptastic ideas, unless you can give it a new spin, and really thoroughly understand the topic. next time, i suggest you find the answers to the following questions before polluting the forums: -- has this been suggested before??? (3s of research will tell you many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many times before) -- if so, why has this been shot down? (<- omg, we expect you to post as an informed person, please do so!). -- is your idea thoroughly vetted? (if its a new idea, get some player feed back... in features and ideas, not assembly hall). finally, for your information, they used to allow mulitple characters to train at the same time, way back in early eve. there are multiply reasons they got rid of it. you should probably be knowledgeable of why they got rid of it, and how those arguments are no longer valid, and/or how re-introducing it at this time won't cause the problems it did before."
6/6/2012,"personal insults are generally a sure sign that your arguments have been deflected and parried, and you have no other logical basis to stand your viewpoints upon, so, 'if i scream louder than the other guy, i'll win"".lol."
6/6/2012,"i didn't insult you (unless being called impatient is an insult). i insulted your idea. i called it recycled, craptastic, and stinky. it is undeniably recycled. perhaps the latter two adjectives are too much opinion, but you wouldn't be complaining if i said fantastic instead of craptastic. you're only complaining because my opinion of the idea doesn't agree with yours. if we can move past that, i also posted a very thorough outline of why it's been shot down before, and explained what is expected of you when bring your ideas to the csm in the future (which is what the assembly hall is for!)."
6/6/2012,"i think that insult part was directed at me and yes it was an insult but mostly just because the op insults the rest of us by posting stupid proposals. i might be a bit inpatient with ignorant people that simply refuse to listen to well founded arguments that doesn<U+FFFD>t support their point of view, or i simply spend time in test at some point in my eve carrier<U+FFFD> pick one."
6/6/2012,"my point was that we already have alternatives. we currently have three slots so that you have the option, for example, to train two market alts while focussing on combat skills for the main character. after a while you will resent the cost of replacing clones for your high-sp characters. you might decide that flying a black ops battleship on your main is enough: more sp will hurt you financially. so you spend time training the other slots in order to sell those sp that you are never going to use.you might train a thrasher-flying alt for rvb or faction warfare because you know that such a ship is viable. that alt doesn't need warp drive operation 5 or retail 5 or amarr encryption methods. so you stop training while the clone replacement isn't going to break your bank.these are choices which have consequences. if you remove the consequences, the choices are not important any more and you break the basic model of eve."
6/6/2012,~ perpetuumnow you answer shahfluffers question....jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.
6/6/2012,"your not getting any support, just like the previous threads where this is braught up. players dont want something that will break the game, and neither does ccp.let the topic die with some dignity please.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
6/6/2012,"i see few good arguments against this, and those that are out there, i know of ways to deal with.i'd eliminate the possibility to trade chars to combat the farming, to name one.but the reason i would like to be able to train multiple chars on one account is because from an rp perspective, one chars training should not affect anothers.alternatively, they could reduce sp/hour to 1/3 if they allowed simultanious char training.or they could just limit the amount of chars to 1 per account, but then you'd have a riot, and i'd participate, but for this reason, it is quite speculative if this idea would cause intolerable subscription loss."
6/6/2012,"yes, this way the sop can be ""make a new account, roll three new characters, and maintain three training queues while playing one character at a time.""also, this would ruin the character market."
6/6/2012,"this would be acceptable. you can train all three characters if you want, but they share the same sp pool and training is slowed for all three.good luck training that caldari battleship v, see you in three months."
6/6/2012,nope.
6/6/2012,comparing the mechanics of the game to 0.0 politics isn't a correct way to get your point across.
6/6/2012,"kestrel not need more mid slot, but coercer need it."
6/6/2012,"in this day of happy filtering and sorting of our new inventory ui why is it i still can't filter my agents / factions for standings with a pretty little text box? the box and its function already exists for the skills tab, simply add it to the certificate and standings tab please.second one, why can't i right click and set my ship speed, i can set my keep at, orbit and pretty much everything else out to exactly what i want not click-1 17m/s click-2 14.7m/s click-3 15.9 m/s ah screw it - simply allow me to right click on my speedometer and set the value in a pretty box like we have all come to love.cheers,oli[proposal] quick changes to ore vessles & gas gear"
6/6/2012,i dont care about the first part but the set speed part makes sence.+1 from me.

6/6/2012,"the ability to set a certain speed would make a lot of sense, though i don't see a great deal of use in it.i'd rather see the agent finder become more useful. for example, let me choose more than one level of agent at a time. also, the drop-down box for system selection? great. we have a list of every system in the game and i get to find a specific name in that mess. let me type (better, let me drag the system name there)."

6/7/2012,does anyone have any suggestions that could make this idea even better?i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
6/7/2012,"i think that the gap you speak of makes sense for eve combat. it is 3-dimensional and filled with open, empty space. if shots coming at you are going to be blocked, you can't really expect your friend next to you to be carrying the shield. it makes a lot more sense for the blocking ship to be blocking damage from itself.but prevention of the attack can be done against anyone shooting-regardless of who they're shooting at-with electronic warfare."
6/7/2012,"as grand zap mentions above, there are already defender missiles in the game, which is a slight nod to the capabilities i'm talking about. they are always a bad trade-off though, and they only defend you, and only from missiles.technology in the context of eve combat would develop so that you could interfere with incoming fire. i'm looking to make it so that you can interfere with the incoming fire on behalf of a friendly. whether the explanation be ""smart reflective chaff"" for deflection of lasers or the super-duper-sci-fi explanation of such a technology is irrelevant. the new mechanic, and the new tactics it would lead to are worthy addition, i think.line-of-sight hasn't been implemented because it's computationally expensive and impractical for eve. but that doesn't mean there isn't a way to bring maneuver into the game in a better fashion than range and transversal management. but not having done the math, i don't know if this could be done the way i describe in this thread. even if positional effectiveness doesn't play a part in the implementation, active defense still has a place."
6/7/2012,fixed.
6/7/2012,this is a very well though out post and it is exactly how i have envisioned the bounty system should work. i support this fully.
6/7/2012,"not sure if you mentioned any good ideas, i stopped reading at griefers vs. ccp. ccp and griefers aren't in any way misaligned. once you have fully recognized this, go back through your post and re-think it. if you still stick by any of your points, come tell em to me, and i'll be more willing to listen."
6/7/2012,^ yup.
6/7/2012,"ummm ... sorry to say, but ccp has thrown away the ""we're greifers too"" attitude. they teamed up with sony for dust514, nothing will ever be the same. the whole reason for discussing changes is that ccp is not going to allow the new player recruitment opportunity that dust will provide to be undermined by a small number of die-hard greifers. they will hard code changes if they need to, so come up with good ideas, or blame yourself if you don't like what happens."

6/7/2012,"i think the hacking module should be completely vulnerable for the entire period of time, and when it succeeds, the pos modules should become irreversibly abandoned, and anyone can scoop them up and re-launch them. the person who set the hacking module should know when it's going to finish, and would be able to show up at about that time to claim the parts."
6/7/2012,"supported,so long as it isn't invulnerable ever,and so long as the timer isn't shorter than 48hrs.also, anyone should be able to claim the pos and the hackng module once it has done unanchoring the pos. this will add some danger to trying to steal poses (because lets face it, that is what you would be doing). it would create some nice small hang incentive, especially as all it would require is a hauler to take it."
6/7/2012,"ahh, this thread is back! cool.still supporting. specifics i'd like to see:- this would only work on an out-of-fuel pos.- the structure would be about as tough as a poco. maybe a bit softer. it's designed for taking down *abandoned* structures, after all, but at the same time shouldn't be vulnerable to a small gang passing through a wormhole without them investing some time.- in highsec, this could be used on any pos without there being a wardec, but the defending corp would gain aggression on the owner so long as the structure is anchored at their pos. now the question i have is, does this unanchor the pos or would i become the new owner? i prefer the latter just because having the pos suddenly unanchor or making it so that *anyone* can unanchor it means that anyone could cash in on my hard work just by knowing when the timer would expire and beating me to the scoop."
6/7/2012,"it would have to unanchor, as there deosnt seem to be any restrictions on who can use it. just as you cabn steal a tower being deployed by a corp ( after they launch for corp and before they anchor) i dont see any problems with allowing others to ninja your hacked tower goods. i forget what happens to ammo in abandoned weapons, but i suspect that teh stront in the tower would either have to get ejected or disappear. - or stront could be the factor which prolongs hacking attempts, and it gets used up that way"

6/7/2012,"an industrial with 3x scan scripted t2 sensor boosters, a prop mod, and this redirector will still take 2s to lock a mwd'ing moros... it will take 3-4 seconds to lock a mwd'ing bc, which is more than enough time for it to be locked. assuming the chance of lock break follow the same mechanics for chance of jam (i haven't tested this), then an ecm burst will break the lock of a hulk or mackinaw with 100% success as long as the exhumer is within the 9 km's optimal range of the ecm burst. this will essentially undermine you're entire suggestion!! it wouldn't be so problematic if the chance of success was say, 20%... but at a 100% success rate, ecm bursts ruin your idea. unlike a repper mod, where the bodyguard is actively activating his mod on a target... this system doesn't seem to require the bodyguard to activate any modules on a target. this seems really, really problematic to me, in regards to aggression transference... the only solution i can think of, is for the bodyguard to activate his beacon on a single target. this would limit the number of ships they can bodyguard to 8 max, given the max of 8 high slots..."

6/7/2012,"the reason you can't train 3 characters at once is because everyone would be training alts they aren't playing, and they would be able to skill into 3 areas at once, instead of one at a time. it only makes sense you should have to pay for this.which is why players should be allowed to pay an additional subscription to train their alts on the same account, i think.oh, and don't mind everyone else. this forum is filled to the brim with people who say nothing louder than everyone else."

6/7/2012,"i think asking ccp for the reasoning behind the large calibration cost on t2 cpu rigs is totally reasonable. pou gives a 7.1% cpu increase for 150 calibration cost. pou ii gives a 9.6% cpu increase for a 300 calibration cost. ( 35% improvement, but costs 100% more)in comparison to the acracr gives a 10% bonus to pg for a 100 calibration cost. acr ii gives a 15% bonus to pg for a 150 calibration cost (50% improvement, but cost 50% more). in fact, most t2 rigs have a 50% increase in calibration cost for a 20-50% increase in performance. so the question is, why does the pou have a 100% increase in calibration cost, instead of a 50%? is this a bug? <-- it easily could be, in which case a change isn't out of line! is this intentional? <-- if it is, asking for an explanation is very reasonable. if it does unbalance something, then it shouldn't be changed. however, currently i'm oblivious as to what it might be unbalancing, and i'd like to know!"
6/7/2012,1
6/7/2012,"it ""might"" be unbalancing gang link ships.... to my understanding, the pressence of cpu rigs have made fitting 6 links on a single ship very doable, and if you could fit multiple t2 cpu rigs to a ship, it might enhance the problem.... if t2 pou's were 225 instead of 300, then you could fit a t2 and a t1 pou on a single tech 1 or tech 3 hull. i don't really know if this is a problem or not, but it might be the reason behind the strange calibration cost."

6/8/2012,"in case you missed it, one of the suggestions above was that in a future dust expansion in-station battelfield environments should be added, so that people can hire dust marines to go do exactly that - kill you inside the station.besides, in null-sec, you just conquor the system, take the station, then kick you into space (full of pretty bubbles), then kill you it's not my fault high-sec stations are immune to pvp. oh wait ... about that game design? yes, it's not even over eve. why i fully expect to see yet more changes to high-sec pvp rules, or changes to exhumer defences, or both. as to the somalian pirates example, the ships should just add defences. many do, picking up mercs before transiting, then dropping them off to the next company ship about to transit the other way. kind of like an iteron adding a small laser and shield boosters. but the point is validly made above: if a 40 million isk battlecruiser can make kills of 800,000 isk rats, and pull in 25 million+ per hour easily, then a hulk that is pulling in far less should not cost $300 million. combat ships should cost far more than industrial ships, because it is the combat systems that make them expensive, not the basic hull. if i lived in the eve world for real, i would have retrofitted battleships to carry t2 strip miners by now, based on the costs.so yes, the cost of industrial ships should be pulled down lower, they are well off the mark. and perhaps a ""civilian overhaul"" option should be added, so that combat ships can be ""t3"" retrofitted: ripping out all their missle systems, half thier turret slots, all their targetting bonuses, but then being able to fit special industrial module mods, for example low-med-high ""fit strip miner"" overhall mods (with all 3 needed, representing how much you had to rip out to put in a t2 miner). let's also not forget that this is space - there should be an ""ore hold"" mod, midslot, that visually is an iteron welded onto the side of the ship (for minmintar) :)"

6/8/2012,it's all apart fo the sand box.
6/8/2012,"no, i think that would reward people that use multiple accounts. any part of a new/changed intel mechanics that is passive in not requiring active player involvement devalues the activity and need for active player intel gatherers and such roles as scouts. i also don't see any need in ""rewarding"" players for being in a fleet, being in an organized group and having more people to fight with and support you is it's own reward."
6/8/2012,"the ability to share intel with the fleet make the benefits of an intel gatherer much more tangibley. furthermore, it allows multiple scouts to pool their intel and get a more accurate representation of what is going on in local. this is the only way to truly scout a system with a large number of pilots!!! in the end, this creates an environment where pilots can be more situationally aware, which is important for being a good pilot. does this mean that people can put their alt into a cloaky ship and have it sit and watch a gate, essentially giving easy intel to all in system fleeted with said person... yes it does... however, i'm leaning towards this being a minor evil. many systems have several entrances, thereby eliminating the effectiveness of this tactic. if you're worried about it being too passive, i'd much rather have a ""transmit"" button that a pilot activates to share the info with fleet members. i think this is a needed mechanic to really bring intel gathering into it's proper role... i.e. intel gathering is done by dedicated intel gathering ships to be shared with the rest of the fleet, which aren't as competent at gathering intel."

6/10/2012,"i'd been thinking on this a bit too but i had a slightly more... brutal and cruel approach in mind, which you may find possible to incorporate in yours.the idea was to scatter bounties - if you have low standings with a faction/sov holder, a bounty could be executed on your head.as such, my almost 5.0 sec status would not prevent someone from being able to put a bounty on my head with a faction i was negative with - but only in that faction's sov would i be a ""no concord"" fair target, though still ""bountied"" if killed in other space (gank style - but concord = sec status loss ...)also it would allow sov groups to use the bounty system directly to place bounties on enemies heads - kind of a ""contract fulfillment"" gig where the funds are held ""npc"" style until someone collects on it or it expires.as such, you could be ""wanted dead in all of highsec"" via sec status or just ""bountied in amarr, caldari (jita)"" etc.. based upon your standings with a faction. as such, any bounty hunter could legally shoot you in that space - no concord, no gcc, etc. a ""legal retaliation"".you could have various bounties in different sectors of space - ""wanted"" where someone could only collect the ones they had access to.(wild west style - bounties in different states, cross the state line and the bounty is invalid but you could kill and go collect but you'd be violating another ""sovereign state's territory"" with all the potential repercussions of that.)build a skill tree for how many bounties you can go after, tie the sizes of them to faction standings and allow bounty hunting in a factions space to actually raise your standings with that faction. a ""registered bounty hunters"" style sub-profession.lots of potential for various uses and abuses. a bit less ... ""kind"" in its applications and it potentially takes ""building/rebuilding standings"" from ""go ratting/mission running"" to ""go kill other players"".i never really fleshed it out all the way but that's the general gist of it - allow bounties and bounty hunters to be setup very broadly and make it much more ""eve"" like - not a two-edged sword but more a morningstar with lots of jagged spikes sticking out."
6/10/2012,"currently the state of faction warfare from what i have noticed is largely one mad offensive dash with little to no defense being played the reason for this is simple, offensive plexes reward lp, defensive plexes give no direct benefitit's quite understandable that defensive plexes give no benefit, for farming purposes, but i have two ideas about how to perhaps combat the mad offensive dash that i perceive faction warfare to be1 reward defensive plexing a fraction of the amount that an offensive plex would give based on the percentage contestedfor example, assume a small plex rewards 15k lp if run offensively running a small plex defensively in a system that is 0% contested would award 0 lp running a small plex defensively in a system that is 50% contested would award 75k lp this would promote defense in more popular systems and would likely lead to more pvp2 break up faction warfare in general into pieces as is the entire set of contested systems are open for attacking and defending perhaps if only a set amount of systems were available for attack/defense at any given time based on the progress of either side so the warfare would progress a bit more logically, albeit in a much more controlled way, and i would personally prefer solution 1visual reference for 2"
6/10/2012,"i support solution 1, it really solves the source of many problems with fw"
6/10/2012,"point 1 would go some way to encouraging defensive plexing there have been a number of good ideas to encourage defensive plexing, some of which included the idea of paying a % of lp directly to infrastructure of the system the plex is in some combination of that and what you suggest would seem ideal to mecould you clarify point 2 a little? do you mean you would only be allowed to contest x amount of systems at once? or contest systems adjacent to a system you already control? based on progress meaning you can contest more when winning or when losing?"
6/10/2012,"there is currently no point in defensive plexing nobody does it (not counting defense fleets) and there's a reason for it, which has nothing to do with whether or not the system is at 3% or 93% contested most people that are plexing are just doing it for the lp farming, even despite the lack of speedtanking, and without any legitimate payout they typically avoid defensive plexing like a plague but the other main reason is simple carebearism, in that your defensively plexing systems that are currently under attack from the opposing militia, ie lots of wt's usually this means it's a hairy proposition for the defensive plexers, which roots out the more casual lp farmer (which, considering how much isk speedtanking sites makes, for how little opposition there isisn't suprising) and thus leaves the aggressor with a target-free system to just grind down till they flip it there is a balance in there somewhere, but i do think rewarding defensive plexing with fractional lp payouts would help in making it a more viable strategy as it is, it's far more profitable to let systems flip, just to flip them back while snagging millions in lp this makes it a frustrating war for amarr, despite the enjoyment to be had from all the cheep pvpfrogblast the vent core! when the w'rkncacnter came, pthia was killed, and yrro in anger, flung the w'rkncacnter into the sun the sun burned them, but they swam on its surface"

6/10/2012,"the ability to pay this way might work except who in their right mind is going to pay the same as a full account? you would be giving up 2 ""same account alt"" slots -and- the ability to have chars logged on at the same time per additional character being trained.there would need to be more value add or a lowered cost for 1 account simply training alts. either of which would cause problems and additional workload for ccp - while doing very little to improve overall game acceptance/satisfaction."
6/10/2012,"ive done some research and was suprised to found nothing related to this topic, so i will try to explain as of the best of my capacity what my vision is. see it this way, many alliances or corporation will use pre-formated fittings and fleet concept for their roams/ops. since the fc needs to have specific damage dealing and etc... it is crucial for everything to be properly planned.here is my suggestion:- have an option inside player/corporation fitting browser witch allow the operator to create a folder, in the folder the operator could then save different fittings related to the subject in question.to have a better vision here is an exemple of a folder structure:fitting browser:----->bomber fleet------->purifier---------->t1 purifier---------->t2 purifier------->manticore------->nemesis------->hound----->developpement fits------->ship name1--------->format 1--------->format 2------->ship name 2------->ship name 3------->ship name 4in conclusion, instead of using the traditionnal way, openning the fitting browser, picking the ship type, searching for the correct fit. etc... etc... the player only as to open the fitting browser, look for the correct folder, and choose the fit he needs.it is a simple addition to the game, i might make it sound big but it realy isn't. it's simple and easy to add, there are lots of different variation of this concept, not only for corporation but for player. it can be used for so many different things.it's simple but will make a huge difference in terms of organisation of one of the most imporant part of the game.if you simply feal this is a good idea please either like the post or write a response of the kind ""nice idea i agree with it and have nothing else to add!"" dont simply skip to the next one because you dont have anything to say about it!thank you, corniel a.tell me what you think?"

6/10/2012,"objective:give small ships (roaming gangs of approx 15 cruisers/bcs) objectives in 00 sov space. why this is needed:currently there is a void in opportunities for small ships to have an impact in 00. destroying pos's aren't really an option for these types of fleets, nor is participating in territorial claiming as a large assault with greater numbers and bigger ships is required. we've all been there...spend 20 minutes getting a roaming gang together, then 20 minutes jumping to the destination, only to find that your opponent turttled up in a pos or station and refuses to fight. your only options are to stay there and camp (boring, no gameplay value) or travel to another destination and hope you find someone to gank who isn't paying attention to intel channels. there needs to be more than this.proposal:1) make i-hub upgrades attackable like station services are. 2) balance the hit points on the upgrades so a 15 man cruiser sized roaming gang can offline an upgrade in 20 minutes. 3) in order to restore the upgrade to online status, the owning corp must pay a fee. (25? mil isk)reasons for doing this:1) gives small ships a target to assault without requiring a full out war or blob warfare.2) adds an economic warfare element that is currently missing in 00. .....a) you know you've inflicted 25? mil isk damages to your enemy per incapped upgrade. (tangible).....b) you know that you've denied access to greater income potential until upgrades are returned to service (intangible)3) it uses assets already in game, so the dev team doesn't have to devote an entire expansion to make it happen. additional bonuses:1) when coupled with kill mails that show reinforced structures (that the devs stated they would be adding to the game)...i can now contract mercenaries to hit someone on the other side of the map, and have a quantifiable result outside of ships destroyed. (i'll pay you x amount per upgrade you offline). mercenaries rejoice. 2) tactical choices: no blob needed. alliances can send out 3 different small roaming fleets to 3 different systems within enemy territory, and cause chaos. imagine the intel channels and the confusion in trying to get a defense fleet together under those circumstances. plus, even if one group is blobbed by the defenders, the other 2 fleets are still causing damage.3) new isk sink added to the game. that's a good thing for the economy."
6/10/2012,stop moon goo production. that'll get their attention (and some fights).
6/10/2012,"if 15 bcs can kill ihub upgrade in 20 minutes a 250 man bs fleet can alpha the upgrades.whilst the idea is commendable it wont happen like that. the blob will move in and destroy all upgrades in 5 minutes, tehn move onto teh next ihub."
6/10/2012,"fair point. but i don't think that's a problem. 250 ships can one-shot a really expensive ship and rack up billions in ship destruction very quickly in a fight, but we don't balance ships to face 250 man blobs as a result. but that's apples to oranges, so... since the fee for fixing the incapped upgrade is relatively small (25m was just an example, it could be 20m or 15m), you could incap an entire systems upgrades for less than the cost of a fitted t2 hac or bs. are corps going to get huge blobs together every day to inflict such a small amount of isk damage? maybe, but it would get old. hitpoints and isk dmg could be balanced to find a sweet spot."
6/10/2012,in the war on clicking i would like to propose that keyboard shortcuts be added for fast overview tab switching. being able to use atl+1-5 just like in chrome would be hot! not to mention that keyboard shortcuts is a better analog to using my mind than moving the mouse and clicking on something. make eve real!
6/10/2012,+1 for an excellent idea.
6/10/2012,"i propose to add more items to the ""ore and materials"" filter in the new inventory system. i don't know exactly what items are included in the filter but i know that planetary interaction products are not included. i would love to use that filter more. pi products are materials and should fit into that filter; it makes sense. maybe this filter could include gas, or moon materials/polymers as well if if they are not already included?if other people would like to include a another group of materials to be added in that filter, propose here. but i propose and ask for pi products to be included !!"

6/11/2012,"that is definitely a concern. but one of the things i mention in the counters post is a new combat tractor that would literally allow a frigate to yank the destroyers out of position. the idea certainly isn't about creating a pos bash, but it is about creating a frigate-fest as an opening to each battle. noobs in frigates and destroyers wouldn't be just a good idea, they'd be needed and actively recruited (i hope)."
6/11/2012,"thank you for your support. my only worry with a tech 3 destroyer is that would make already diluted cruisers entirely useless (t3 is about versatility at an efficiency level between tech 2 and tech 1). destroyers today are characterized by a frigate tank with roughly double a frigate's punch. i can see making an aegis destroyer another tech 2 hull, but i'd prefer a brand new tech 1 destroyer with a role bonus."

6/11/2012,i have drawn an incredibly crude picture designed to represent the idea
6/11/2012,"i think by rewarding defensive plexing, this will also help solve the issue of solo offensive plexing simply because there will be more defenders in a more contested system sure this will encourage the people who really want to solo plex to go to uncontested systems, but eventually an equilibrium will be reached"
6/11/2012,"i giggled when i read ""incredibly"" but the picture works very well in accordion to your explanation this makes a lot more sense now that we have a visual on how it would work"
6/11/2012,i like the idea of lp based on % contested it makes sense both from game mechanics and rp point of view but i can't support your idea of warzones let the militias decide what systems they think they can take (and defend)
6/11/2012,"ok, but ... i don't think this is about risk. it is really just about the grief and the game mechanics where players are ""supposed to be active"" and not botting or causing things to happen while afk.you had an interesting idea to ""tag"" the guy in local as afk, but ""just a tag"" would (as noted) surely be abused.but, along the same idea, it occurs to me: we already have an in-game feature to report griefing in local if someone uses ""inappropriate words or gestures"" ... lol. perhaps the same mechanic could be improved by adding a check box [ok, whatever... i'm not a programmer, but u get the idea here?] .. or some other reporting feature that could be initiated by a player who feels someone isn't at the keys for xxx minutes or hours ... which can in turn be followed up by some game admin whenever they are bored or between cups of coffee or something. after all, if the grief really goes on 24/7 ... it's not a labor intensive thing to identify and cause the reported griefer to ""lose his connection"" for violation of eula to be at the keys when playing. but, you'll say we cant do that! oh, wai.. that might cause the griefer some grief! [like the time i got banned briefly from posting in local because someone in the enemy fleet pushed that button and reported me for ... never mind....]just a thought, anyways... grief for grief, sounded good at first blush. so shoot at it."
6/11/2012,"it's called a niche. your interpretation is way off the mark, as the game is continually further developed, which you would have noticed if you weren't so busy whining about ccp's bottom line (which you have no real knowledge of). remember the last time ccp had to fire a bunch of people? guess what, it wasn't because of ""griefers"".it isn't underperforming at all. it is a niche game that attracts a certain audience. steep learning cliff? whenever i hear that phrase my stomach turns, since this game isn't rocket science, it just looks complex because nearly all other games are being developed with a barely literate audience in mind. you shouldn't have to be able to think, hell, some people don't even want to be at their keyboard to be able to play. why is it that some miners/industrials (in high sec, mind you) are making tons of money off this hulkageddon, while others are writing post upon post feebly arguing that some of the core ideas of this game need to be destroyed in order for it to survive?there you go again. what are you, ccp's accountant? i highly doubt it, since you don't even seem to grasp the very basic notion that using plex to play does not make any difference to ccp at all.oh yeah, before the usual moaning starts: never ganked a miner or industrial myself, never been ganked; never scammed anyone, never been scammed. still think it's a part of the game."
6/11/2012,"they did have to let people go last year because ccp didn't have enough cash to pay them. that's called the blunt bottom line - if you don't bring in enough us$, you can't keep paying it out if you want to survive as a business. at 9 years old, eve should be paying ccp a lot more than it currently appears to be. ""a lot of interest in the ip"" is industry speak for people want to buy the rights to use eve online's brand. you should stop right now, face the emperor, and thank all the amarr gods in eve that ccp didn't just sell the rights.it does make a difference to ccp when they gave the plex away, and forgo income because of it. plex also creates a future debt. look at where america's economy ended up by being too cute with debts.read what ccp's ceo is saying. dust is a doorway into the eve world: and ccp will probably not make real money off dust long term unless those players move into eve itself, and pay with actual us$. free to play dust means ongoing costs: if dust does not pull in the new subscribers sony wants for its ps3, who do you think is going to be footing the bill to keep dust working once the initial contract is up for renegotiation? just like in eve itself, nothing is ever really free. so do the math and think about it - dust's pricing model only works long term if ccp get a lot of players coming into eve from dust, and subbing up and staying. it's brilliant as a marketing tool, but viable in the long term only if new players join the game, and stay. this whole thread is about minor changes to improve the likelihood that an identified subsegment of the population would continue to play, and indeed play and buy and use plex on items too. save a carebear, help ccp. you have all of nullsec and lowsec to go crazy ganking people in, i don't see what the issue is about improving protetions for newer/social orientated players in highsec. the isk per hour mining there sucks, anyway. oh and thank you for contributing. i had a friend join red v blue and he had superb things to say about you guys. discussing an issue should always be about the issue, not about the person speaking. and the more perspectives on an issue, the more robust the conversation, the more useful it is for game developers. games like these are inevitably about balancing competing tensions, however ultimately the commercial bottom line has to win out (or like so many pvp games before, the game shuts down)."
6/11/2012,"i guess you don't know that the actual problem was that ccp had started up (and focused heavily on) two new games instead of maintaining/updating the game which was actually paying those bills, and the game (i.e. eve online) was suffering an exodus as a result?it has ****-all to do with ""save a carebear"". people unsubscribing is of course not optimal, but you have no idea how many people are subscribing because of the lamentations of these carebears."
6/11/2012,"battleships are not 800k in null, and a retriver is 20 million. most of the ""pvp"" i see in nullsec is 2004 vets in super-fast ships with massive alpha appear, obliterate a 2 month ~ 1 year old toon, and vanish out of system. then you get the huge fleet fights, where the whole game performance crawls to a slideshow mess, then a bomber wing obliterates everyone. you seem to have forgotten that you can make combat ships more expensive or you can make mining ships cheaper. as things stand, i can see why people ridicule this game so much - your arguments simply don't reflect the experiences of many other players, and because you are so full of self-righteous bullshit you don't even realise how weak your argument is. you don't make 25 million an hour on minerals in nullsec - because you have no-one there to buy anything off you. without highsec, there is no game. nullsec is a bad joke, with a great deal of boring mechanics that are nothing more than poorly designed isk sinks. that is my personal impression: null needs work. and too bad if you don't like it, but don't tell me how easy it is in nullsec, because it's not. what you mean by nullsec is probably the ""we never ever have pvp here"" goons reigon or something, where the players are so bored they go to highsec."
6/11/2012,"no, you're right, if you live in non-**** space battleships are actually 1.4-1.6m each (i forget the exact figure, i don't rat much). vovthis is why i pay for my subscriptions.you haven't tried this in tidi, have you? or haven't you learned to switch off various graphical options if your computer isn't up to scratch?or, more likely, the entire bomber wing explodes in a fiery ball of death because they couldn't warp out quickly enough.why should they be? given your argument, jumpfreighters should be reduced in price too, it's so unfair that a few bses can kill a ship which is costing between 6-7 billion isk. :( :( :(face it, you're paying those 300m for a marginal increase in output and tankability (so you can actually use it in, say, nullsec). you're not entitled to anything in particular just because you've paid a lot of money for it."
6/11/2012,"this thread is so full of terribly thought out posts and really really bad logic that it hurts my head.dust wont make any money unless the dust players move to eve? someone hasn't been paying the slightest bit of attention to the way the mmo market is moving. free to play games earn more money than most subscription games. want to know how? play one and you'll see.there is nothing wrong with mining ships, there is nothing wrong with the price or effectiveness of destroyers, and there is nothing wrong with highsec. the only problem we do appear to have is that suicide ganking is too easy. and so any sensible person who sees the above would just think ""change the mechanics of how easy it is to suicide gank"", or ""make the consequences of suicide ganking more dire"". don't drag other aspects of the game into an already complicated subject. they don't have to have anything to do with it."
6/11/2012,"i lol'd. you clearly don't know what you're talking about. a 5 year old toon and a 6 month old toon can do the same thing. the only difference is a 5 year old toon has access to different other ships. no one to buy anything off you? got to be joking. there are loads of manufacturers in nullsec. supercap production as well. you can manufacture in null and seed the market? ever thought about that? nullsec is easy. probably safer than highsec. you probably just had a bad experience or friends had 1 bad experience and thought **** it i'm leaving. nullsec isn't just about huge fleet fights. there are plenty of small-medium size gangs out there. only though, most of the fights that are publicised are the huge ones. and fyi, bomber wings rarely work. just 1 lemming with the wrong bomb or wrong placement to **** everything up. get out into nullsec and experience it yourself."
6/11/2012,"the primary issue i have with these suggestions/arguments is, as a whole, they generally promote the creation of an isolated niche population within the game, which runs counter to the core of eve. sure there are some updates that probably should be made to industrial/mining ships to make them a bit more competitive vs upgrades to combat mechanics/ships, however there are reasonable steps that can be made to make high-sec a lot safer by becoming more organized. you know, actually interacting with others in a sandbox mmo. every remotely successful group of players in eve has some level of organization. this is already what you're kind of proposing with a ""crafting guild."" rather than introducing some artificial mechanic, why don't you go out and organize a player-manned version with similar objectives as those that you proposed? if it looks like too much work.... then find a way to share the workload with others that share your vision. in any event, the further compartmentalization of the eve universe is not the answer."
6/11/2012,"you might not satisfied with the attitude of the csm towards the dwellers of high security empire space which was summarized by alekseyev karrde: ""you have to deal with it... or stay docked... or play another game.""instead of whining, let me introduce !it is a lobby organization. we have no politicians (csm candidates), but try to influence all of them by offering them the votes of our members if the politician supports the views of the organization. we do nothing in-game (maybe a jita-march before the election). our sole purpose is to influence the csm election to get a csm8 that supports our ideas. how will we do it? we'll have a big enough voter-block that is too juicy to be ignored. highsec hold 80% of the players. we have 80% of the votes. we can own csm if we start voting instead of crying on the forums to ccp that does nothing until the csm speaks up. ccp listens to csm. however most of the csm members came from nullsec, representing those who gank us. they are ignoring us, but we deserve that as we are ignoring the election.to make differece, we need votes. if you are supporting the ideas of , you should join the corp to show it to the csm. of course you shouldn't do it on an active char. the corp will do nothing and probably will be wardecced in the second this post goes up. join only with station trader or manufacturer alts, the ones who barely ever leave stations. or simply start a new alt on an empty slot and join. if you have multiple accounts, you have multiple votes, so join in multiple instances. join as soon as you can, as characters must not be on trial accounts or younger than 30 days to vote. everyone would assume younger pilots to be trial alts created for the purpose of looking bigger. if you make an alt for this purpose now, make it caldari so i don't have to learn ethnic relations 5. also, spread the word in your real corp and friend list, ask them to join too. has three program points: * less griefing* more highsec/pve content * no power item shopthe details will be worked out. you can of course take part of that discussion too, but if you agree with the main points, you shall join! if we just whine, they keep ignoring us. if we present thousands of votes, they will start to care.see the details on"

6/11/2012,"if it costs isk, it's irrelevant. incap every goonswarm ihub and they'll barely even notice paying the fee to fix them all.how is that an advantage over the usual rep mechanics every other structure has?"
6/11/2012,"ships also generally aren't static structures which just sit around 23.5/7 waiting for someone to shoot them, either."
6/11/2012,"this isn't really a ""we're going to bankrupt them"" concept as much as a ""we're going to inflict a little damage to their wallets for not defending their space"" concept. focused on small ships, it shouldn't be a bankrupting situation anyways. it adds an opportunity that isn't currently there, and would hopefully help encourage more pvp or more roaming gangs, knowing that if they didn't find anyone to gank, they could at least inflict some type of damage to the opponent. the only way of doing 'economic warfare' against big alliances is through moon mining systems, and even then they have t2 bpos and other methods of income. smaller corps, corps within less established alliances, and even individual corps within a big alliance that don't have moon income would feel the impact, depending on the size of the fee of course. no doubt they'd rather spend that 100 or 200 or however many millions you cost them on equipment or resources more than on restoring their upgrades. it'll add up. the advantage to a fee rather than simply repping is that it's quantifiable. if it was just a repping situation, what is the impact? someone could just use an alt to rep while they run the belts, or go to another system you didn't hit with an online upgrade leaving little impact if any. it's more definitive with the fee, and it comes out in pure isk rather than time."
6/11/2012,"which means that small entities'll be more heavily penanized economically than the big guys, which won't give a flying ****.hint: pocos.again, pocos.sigh, this again. stop this, this isn't the big moneymaker you think it is.time hurts more equally than isk. balancing anything on isk doesn't work, never has, never will.as for ""an alt can just rep it while they run the belts"", well, guess they're going to be that much easier to gank then."
6/11/2012,i like the idea of a target for smaller gangsbut i think the repair process should at least take 24 hours or soand poco are not for small gangs as they have 15mil ehp and a reinforce timer
6/11/2012,"while i very much want to see small gang warfare targets, i don't think your suggestion fits the bill: 1.) station services have enormous amounts of ehp. they are not small gang targets. 2.) i don't think current ihub mechanics mesh well with your goal: -- if you can repair an upgrade for isk, the damage you inflict will be easily negated by a quick payment... 25m is nothing to a large corp.. hell, its nothing to many ratters... -- upgrades only go online at the next dt, and upgrades typically go offline immediately. if you allow a small-sized gang to be able to shut off upgrades, you create a very annoying tz warfare situation... -- imo, there is too little risk for the marauders, given the economic impact they can inflict. it's easy to avoid a counter assault, and they risk very little while shooting the ihub. in short, i like your goal, i just don't think this is a viable implementation (in its current form). another note: i had a corp mate that propsed a fairly neat idea very much in line with this: player created incurionsthis does not create sansha incursion sites! the main idea: it's a deployable device that causes system-wide incursion effects to screw over general pve. -- reduced resistances on all ships...-- reduced bounties on all npc rats...and a few other ideas were suggeted to affect ore mining, ice mining, pi, moongoo, etc; but the above two are the main goal. the concept.... a marauding group comes into local, anchors the device creating a system wide warpable beacon, they then online it. if the enemies don't destroy the low-ehp beacon within 15 minutes (or whatver), the system gains the above incursion effects for the next several hours... (my favorite alteration of it, was that the effects would last a few days, but the severity of the effects would wax around the deployment period and wane for the rest of the day) then, the marauders can unanchor the device, move to another system, and redeploy it. the goal, is to force the locals to form up and fight off the marauders before their precious ratting system becomes much less effective!!! it's low ehp (think a few 10's of thousands, not miilions), and the fact the marauders are putting the device at risk, essentially give them something to lose. and the 15 minutes to online period force the locals to act quickly (limiting blob potential)."
6/11/2012,we clearly need faction warfare plexes in nullsec
6/11/2012,"at the moment, to clear a chat window you need to right click the top border and select 'clear all content'.a better idea would be to have it as a right click option inside the panel that actually has the text you want to clear. (currently that panel only has copy, copy all and toggle timestamp)"
6/11/2012,"greetingsi second this. whoever said that 3k m3 was giant is probably the same one who told us what six inches looks like. instead of looking for a new and abused game mechanic, how about a usable secure cargo container with 20k m3 just so the truly greedy will still jet can mine. the container in theory would fit empty inside a badger mk1 with cargo expanders, so as to have something to train to. when anchored it would expand to usable size and would need to be emptied again to un-anchor and move.vreastin the imortal words of socrates: "" i drank what?!"""
6/11/2012,well said. but in all likelihood they will ignore your good suggestion and carry on bickering about a subject that isn't going anywhere. that seems to be the way of this forum in general.

6/12/2012,well if you put it that way...
6/12/2012,"i like this approach.add to that things like if you shoot too many npcs of a faction (pirate or empire) or make it standing based, they (npc factions) can put bounties on your head too, which makes your open game for player bounty hunters in their space. (not much diff in low/null though) and killing a player with a npc bounty gives you standing boost with that faction too. very interesting.but, this good idea, like many others still needs to address the fundamental flaw with bounty hunting profession today, which is, how do you keep people from collecting on their own bounties.without a fix for this, no bounty hunting feature will work."
6/12/2012,"you obviously havn't read any of the thread. stopping people from collecting their own bounties has been adressed, over and over and over.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
6/12/2012,"yea, i definitely prefer solution 1, having that sort of rigid control inside a game as free as eve would feel weird"
6/12/2012,"option 3: find a mechanism for defending the system that doesn't involve orbiting a button afk for 15 minutes at least when offensive plexing there are rats to tank/shootthe problem is that capturing and defending systems is tedious if we have to orbit a thing to change vulnerability, give more system % per outpost and reduce the spawn rate of outposts to compensate (i know that the devs want systems to take ~35 hours to flip)it would be better if we had a capture mechanism that was more interesting"
6/12/2012,"with mechanism 1, you would be more likely to be defensively plexing in a highly contested system, meaning a much greater chance of having some pvp going on"
6/12/2012,"just a question. the afk tag is dangerous for any player ? nothe afk tag changing the game mechanics ? noeveryone knows why would be disturb the afk tag some cloaky fags, who lying in this topic ""i'm afk at enemy systems and i cant kill anyone when i'm afk"", because they would be lost the chances to terrorizing active players in afk."
6/12/2012,*reports all 1500 people in jita**several times*
6/12/2012,agree.it's true.
6/12/2012,"it's also stupid. if you are afraid of cloakers, then get out of nullsec."
6/12/2012,"i knew we weren't going to get along very well. your doing it again. you can't just say ""no!"" to stuff and expect people to take you seriously. if you want people to take your opinion seriously you need a couter arguemnet, which i imagine you are too daft to think up.also, nice alt post. again. you really do make it very obvious.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
6/12/2012,"if you are afraid from afk tag, then get out of game."
6/12/2012,this!!!
6/12/2012,"silly rabbit. not a jita issue.this mechanic issue and my suggestion for a solution using the reporting button only apply in null sec and low sec, as your war decs in empire already have time limits. as the new players already noted above, an afk enemy or neutral player in empire doesn't cause the same type of grief, does not require the same type of respect/response. fear is not the issue. players have to respect the game mechanics, which includes the off chance the afk dude walks by his computer or gets active when the locals are trying to do their thing without proper ""respect"" to the neut in system. boom!so, don't be afraid. be insured. be griefed. just make the game more enjoyable, and give the majority some counters to shake this up?"
6/12/2012,"yet we already have that hardcoded in with the null sec alignment rules. this game already has near-totally separate populations of players, however the real issue is the most vocal, richest, and most pandered to by ccp are the null sec pvpers.eve was always intended to be a game that supported many different gameplay styles, as a true space simulator. most of the arguments above by the pvp crowd are essentially that if you are not a pvp player, get out of the game. that is not what eve is meant to be about. the critical issue is that with the current game mechanics, it is simply not possible to prevent someone killing a mining ship. you literally cannot stop them, as discussed above ""it is too easy"". conceptually, miners should be able to have pvpers guard them if they want to: but that is not actually a valid tactic in highsec, until the greifers fire, there is no right to fire upon them. and the new ships and power of alpha strikes now means that it is simply not possible to stop the kill.that's broken. spin it any way you want, bored null sec billionaires going to highsec and murderering social orientated mining players is just not good for the game. it's promoting no-skill pre-forma 'pvp', not highly fluid skill-dependent pvp. no-lose-kills are as stupid for the game as introducing battlecruisers that were not properly designed or balanced. you *like* the drakes overrunning the game? think that makes for good dynamic pvp? **** gets old fast.no matter how you spin it, highsec miners have been getting the thin edge of the wedge from ccp : they pay the same money per month as others, often more because they usually can't afford plex. so come on ccp, sort it out: t2 mining ships should have survivability. if a t2 transport can have a +2 warp core stabiliser, not bad shields and armour, so too ca a hulk that costs twice as much and takes longer to train into. or make the damn things cheaper - and yes, make freighters / jump freighters cheaper as well while you are at it."
6/12/2012,"but i am entitled to raise an issue when gankers drive my mining friends out of the game. why? because i paid real money to play this game, and i think the highsec ganking has revealed what i consider to be real flaws in the game design and balance. this game has been underperforming for years: for ages, ccp thought it was that people were too distant from their characters, so they added walking in stations. that hasn't really changed all that much though. guess what, the issue seems to be greifers being total wankers for no better reason than they are bored. that has killed other pvp games. offline, gone, dead. i don't want that to happen here, with eve underperforming and limping along with ever less-well-balanced shiny toy ships being used to appease the restless (thinning) masses. miners have been forgotten, while year after year, pvpers have been given a rediculous amount of new ships, so many in fact that nearly all the original ships are simply obsolete. you can build what, 3 oracles for the minerals it takes to build an apocalypse? guess which does more damage at 100 km, and which gets to warp quicker if things are not going your way. yay, well done ccp, again. nice balance there ... not. i'm waiting for the mini-carrier-titan-combo-battlecruiser next"
6/12/2012,"a macro cause of the grief that the op and many new players feel in eve is that this game was designed by griefers, for griefers and griefing will always be a part of this game. it was designed this way.i'm a carebear and run a carebear corp and i do it in a universe that is constanlty trying to grief me. that is the way it is and the way it will be. always remember, the people who designed the game, and who continue to make game design decsion, are griefers. if you are going to play this game for awhile and enjoy it you have to deal with this truth.[as a carebear i deal out my own form of grief ]"
6/12/2012,"it's ccp's fault you don't watch local, use d-scan, mine away from the default warpin point, mine in empty systems or tank your hulks? (if you're that worried about highsec gankers, move to nullsec or wormhole space. there must be corps around who'll take you without any of the uninformed bs you guys always spew when the suggestion is made. as a nullsec resident for ~18 months or so, i've never experienced most of what gets complained about.)ganking is not griefing. if i gank you once, it's a gank. if i gank you exclusivley every time you undock in highsec? yeah, that's griefy. if tier 3 bcs have replaced battleships, why do the nullsec entities use battleships as the mainstay of their fleets? why do highsec missionrunners use battleships? why do i use a magathron over a talos for ratting?i don't think you know what balance is either. put an oracle into a brawl an apoc would come out of perfectly fine, and you'll find you have a dead oracle. they fill different roles entirely.not that you'll read any of this..."
6/12/2012,"+ 1 . yeah i gave up on the csm. frankly it is time for ccp to review the entire csm concept. the entire gonswarm fiasco via "" the milantti "" was directly caused by the csm office. my theroy is let ccp come up with ideas and if they fail. then people will"
6/12/2012,griefing is a bannable offence. what's the problem?
6/12/2012,"ccp and csm5 agreed to ""vanity items only"". go read fearless and understand the horror that would be released on the game if ccp decided to settle for ""no power items"". the three types of transactions identified were vanity, concierge and power. concierge items were things like paying money to have more saved fittings.scatim helicon would do a better job of ""the voice of hisec"" than gevlon. though i fear that statement is condemning with faint praise."
6/12/2012,"@giznitt: safe corp: no towers, same missioning tax as an npc corpcan you give any sensible reason why would a real newbie spend his time and very limited resources with suicide-ganking? i'd say every 1-month old suicide ganker is a throwaway recruit-a-fr"
6/12/2012,"you want ""safe""? stay in your npc corp.yes: it's fun.hey, i have a better idea, let's remove insurance in its entirety.last i checked, griefing was going after one player in particular, or going after newbies in starter systems. scamming some random idiot or ganking a random hulk isn't automatically griefing in the ""we'll ban you"" way, it's part and parcel of how eve works."
6/12/2012,"also heh ""ccp shall not remove plex"". that's funny. i'm sure that demand'll go down well."
6/12/2012,"i love these highsec demagoguesthis sounds somewhat similar to issler's ""voice of reason"" party from the last election"
6/12/2012,"so, if new accounts are banned from crime, does that mean low and null are totally off limits to them, or just low? and why ban people in npc corps from having fun?"
6/12/2012,"im a nullsec player. i have 3 accounts, 3 characters are in nullsec, the rest are support characters in hisec. of my 9 playable toons, 6 are in hisec, that is 66% of my pilots. 80% of pilots in hisec are in fact not hisec players.. many of them are merely nullsec players miners, haulers, incursion runners fw mission runners and other stuff. these people will consider themselves nullsec players. not to mention the amount that are nullsec peoples hisec ganking alts. 80% of characters may be in hisec. that doesnt equate to 80% of people being hisec players."
6/12/2012,"i just noticed this. i have 3 accounts, 2 of my characters are in nullsec, the rest are in hisec doing various things.80% of the accounts may stay in hisec, it's not 80% of the players though."
6/12/2012,it's kind of cute how frequently people try to play william wallace.
6/12/2012,"confirming that all my disposable scout/cyno alts are in highsec, doing... what exactly?non-playing disposable alts are placed where your actual characters don't want to be - that would be lowsec, not highsec or null."
6/12/2012,"i don't know about you, but i do considerable business in hisec when i'm not in a fleet in null. this includes watching prices in a lot of market hubs etc."
6/12/2012,station games as far as i can tell are pretty much against everything ccp stands for.station games save ships when they should die.station games give the cowardly high sec war deccers a mechanic to hide behind even tho they are the ones that aggressed.i am tired of trying to go 1v2 and having to go home with no kill simply because i dont have the dps to alpha one of the 2 players.proposal: make warp scrambled ships unable to dock. or better yet make ships that are being aggressed currently unable to dock similar to the nerf of the super loggoffski trick.pro: more ships will die and this promotes more actual fights.con: cowards wont be able to hide behind station mechanics anymore.
6/12/2012,repeat. ccp dont want directional scanner spamming every two seconds. (that's why they changing the dscanner delays to 2.5 seconds)this idea is bad and delayed local too. no more cloaking boost.not supported.

6/12/2012,"ccp why have you yet again just completely screwed up faction warfare?why have you made it into 0.0 effectively? with this stupid station lock outs, sov type bashing and whatever else.!this isnt what we want from faction warfare, if we wanted that we would go to nullsec!lowsec has just become nullsec with restrictions. we dont want to be endlessly fighting for sov! thats the reason why we came out of nullsec!.you know why alot of us went to faction warfare? to shoot stuff and for targets plain and simple. i mean its our battlegrounds effectively.stop allowing highsec bears to be in fw if they are going to be protected! whats the point of being in 'war' if you hide in highsec all the time. remove the boundaries, remove the navies, allow people to shoot others in highsec if they are in fw without protection. yes i understand that something has to be fought over, but station lock outs seriously? you forcing us to do endless grinding just to be able to dock! yet again the most boring depressing thing you can come up with you did. whats with the obsession about grinding through this stuff!i dont think this should be forced, i think yes have something people can play for or a prize to win if they so wish to do so. just like the old days of deds where people competed to get them (of course randomise them) otherwise they get taken over like last time. i dont think stuff should be implemented that makes someone play a specific way, or be forced to. the problem is you have to fight for the system in order to stay in it. i didnt sign up for that, and i know alot of people in fw didnt either..we might as well just all go pirate! and have an alt in fw to farm missions if need be!"

6/13/2012,"this is my old post unedited from (when we lived in lowsec) back in teh old forums, it never made it here but it drummed up alot of support and criticism i think its time it was looked at and discussed again maybe, if somethign along these lines were implemented, all the people who left lowsec and went to 00, maybe some would return maybe more would live there after this a lowsec improvement 'comittee' was set up, approved by ccp, it disbanded very fast as no one was interested in listening really maybe its time to look againnot all the ideas will eb popular, not all will be realistic, but lets start a new look at lowsechere it is in its unedited form (though lots of additions and edits were done at the time as new posts were put inproposed lowsec expansion 'outlaw'i renamed the thread titlelowsec needs some serious attention to make it the great place it should be and im not talking about fw, which is pretty much unrelated to 'real' lowseclowsec is about criminals, its about piracy, its about the dark underworld of new eden i think its about time it had some deserved attention it would take a lowdec patch to really turn it into the place it should be, i suggest ccp do just that, the update should be called 'outlaw'i have the following proposals for this, and by no means are these all my ideas, so thanks to all the people who have put ideas around before1: criminal underworld, similar to 00 sov, recognition should be given to the 'overlords' who dominate systems, some sort of benefits may be 'bought' with underhand payments to authorities, such as the rats in a system may notengage unless fired upon, or reduced facility rates, offices etcmaybe something similar to the new sov mechanics with a 'hub' pos using modules to upgrade the system this would need to be les impacting than 00, so the best you could upgrade should not be as good as an un-upgraded 00 system (possibly only available in the lower security, say 01 and 02)2: criminal faction agents for missions beter rewards for missions in lowsec generally thesse agents would be ayt pirate stations that can only be found by probing3: the blackmarket, have a market that can only be accessed when in lowsec, and with items that can only be sold on the black market all 'illegal' items moved onto this market maybe with npc smuggling items too create more illegal items to load onto the market more drugs, maybe illegal implants see also 4 the black market panel only becomes available when in a black market station, which would only be the pirate/criminal stations4: pirate faction ships and items become illegal in hisec, so whilest usable in hisec, become available only through the black market5: make better smuggling oportunities, with these illegal items, make a smuggling proffesion more viable6: crooked cops, have random faction npcs for that region wander lowsec, looking for payoffs hand over a little isk to go free, or fight themmaybe the overlord can see to it that these crooked cops dont interfere with their people7: have lowsec borders between all the empires, or at least the empires who are at war, so there is no 'safe' route for people, this way people would actually hire escort personel to protect haulers, another career opportunity smugglers would also be employed in such places8: new pos modules such as pleasure hubs and so on, could be you need to supply it with drugs/food/alcahol etc and in return it earns money would need to be limited to like 1 or 2 per pos though to avoid large pos 'super brothels' being built en-mass in systems to make huge isk this income should be small in comparison to moon mining etc9: some form of cyno jamming as in 00, lowsec is becoming blobbed with caps possibly only the system that an alliance has 'godfather' status could be cyno jammed would be part of the upgrades available to system overlords10: better ore, better missions etc, to keep the isk warriors coming in despite the riskalot of people are saying how there arnt enough people coming to lowsec, but people need to have a reason to go there im not interested in getting more carebears to wander in to get ganked (yes im a pirate, but i prefer a fight), what id like to see is more organisations fighting for turf gang wars, pirate factions fighting each other, or real opportunities for anti pirates to go in and wage war against their hated enemieswe need a deeper immersion for lowsec, bring it on please, make lowsec the dark and dangerous underbelly that society loves to hate lowsec shouldnt be a dangerous version of hisec, just as 00 isnt a no concord version of hisec it should be a seperate experience in itself"
6/13/2012,"a quote from a beloved gmnow i don't have a problem with rookie protectionism in the rookie systems but when you extend it outside those systems i have a problem as it makes eve a less complete place and at the moment this is only going to be enforced in arnon. but personally i don't want to see this outside of rookie systems [including arnon]. in hatakani there is an incursion atm, so shall we protect rookies from those too? the gm discretion has to play a part but a lot of gm discretion is ill advised. i don't kill rookies unless they are generally war targets or something similiar. in-game mechanics should be used to help rookies instead of artificially coddling them and its not as if they have much to lose anyway most of the time.would rookie alts be protected too in the future? new players who bought an old character. stop spoiling the sandbox for the majority for the sake of the new."
6/13/2012,"how about we propose a new system: a rookie tag on characters that indicates they are not fair game. the specifics of this tag would need to be worked out (i'll get back to that). if you steal from a wreck or can owned by a rookie, you risk bannage. if you gank a rookie, you risk bannage. if you do anything to ruin the npe, you risk bannage.ways to trigger the rookie flag being turned off:- the account reaches a certain age (alts would never be rookies)- the character joins a player corporation- the character engages in activities outside of the new player experience (tutorials, career agents, soe arc)- other stuff i haven't though ofthis would take some serious work to prevent it being abused, but i think it would solve the problem and prevent people from blundering into warnings and bans by not knowing ""the list."""
6/13/2012,"i agree that protecting systems that are distant from the rookie systems is a bad idea. but i also agree completely with the gms that greifing in those systems hampers ccps growth, and is frankly not cool.move the career agents to the systems next to the rookie systems. then have it protected. problems (both of them) solved.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
6/13/2012,"1.) i think clear labels on the system label, stating it's a rookie system is very appropriate. -- i'm under the impression it's hard to know what system is considered ""rookie safe""!! 2.) i think any special rules that apply to rookie systems should be blatantly stated on one of the system's information tabs!!!--- personally, i think special rules for rookie systems (like no can baiting), is just a pita to enforce, it's a pita to keep track of, and having the rules extend to ""other"" systems is not ok!!! move the soe arc to rookie systems, don't expand the rookie system limitations into soe systems!!! 3.) rather than deal with can baiting crap in rookie systems, it would probably be better to have all can's automatically set blue (abandoned) in rookie systems. this way the rookie will only get aggression when they steal from a wreck or shoot at someone for doing so!!! finally, it's pretty sad we need protections for rookies...."

6/13/2012,"your proposal doesn't make capturing mechanisms any more interesting, we're still orbiting a thingmaybe means more fights maybeor maybe it means smart players find some other ways plex, that still avoid fights for example, maybe they'd farm two systems in a frigate and bound back and forth leading an opposing fleet on a merry chase (more likely the fleet wouldn't bother, really because a single frigate is a tedious target to hunt) maybe they just log on when it's not the other team's peak and plex in peace for extra lpthe problem with capturing systems isn't a lack of lp and so far we don't lack for pvp the problem is that orbiting a thing is tedious as all hell and you need to do it for like 35 hours to make a difference"

6/13/2012,"i assume you just mean nullsec as i imagine your gripe is with hotdrops. because if your issue is just you can't be bothers to defend yourself or press dscan every minute then you shouldn't be mining anywhere out of highsec. so are you seriously advocating that gms start investigating if a alleged afk cloaker is really online with eyes on screen or not? gms don't have too much to do anyway so yeah sure let's put one more impossible and meaningless task for them to attend to. besides are you seriously advocating that gms enforce that people press a button to prove they are alive?i'm a cloaky. i should be the one who has to do nothing and just sit and watch and collect intel. that is the whole point of cloakys. i don't make money from collecting intel. so that's why i don't need to be pushing buttons like you are, mining away and making cash. if you fear a hotdrop you need to have spies of your own in systems jump distance away from your location. i assume you have no issue with cloakers if they had no ability to hotdrop right? if so then you have to get over the fact that you need to actively defend against hotdrops in null. that's life in null. that's why you get the big bucks. sorry if you can't safely mine like you can in highsec. that's life."

6/13/2012,"an afk tag must be one of the dumbest ideas i've seen suggested, congratulations. local already provides ridiculously valuable information to low/null players at absolutely no cost (something i personally think should change). wanting it to provide even more information is just ludicrous - especially something like the activity level of another player. sorry, you shouldn't be able to know that unless they do something which alerts you or unless you're actively doing something to try and detect their activities like scanning."
6/13/2012,"afk tags in local means you could get the bot to recognize the afk tag as a non-risk factor.if you do botting, this would be a great idea to increase the effeciency of your bots.removing local, or at least delaying it would be more usefull in terms of reaching the intended design goal (null-sec = danger).living in a wormhole makes you paranoid. you could propably learn alot from this but it doesn't stop people from doing any activity. because there is a feature that helps in risk asessment: d-scan."
6/13/2012,delayed local is the most dumbest idea what i'd seen.afk tag is fine.
6/13/2012,"i live in lowsec, and i have a cyno alt (that is now repurposed into a hauling alt). i have 2 extra character slots each on both my cyno account and main account. that's 4 random characters that are sitting in market hubs for quick price checks. i consider myself a lowsec player even though 83.5% of my actual characters are parked in highsec right now.i am also starting up a corp that has 90% taxes for people who think kittens are cute. join up unless you are anti kitten! also the kittens demand that you farm incursions non stop.if you want highsec to have less risk then it needs less rewards. kill highsec incursions. only have veldspar and scordite in the belts, move level 4 missions to lowsec. do that and then you can have your invincible hulks.or we could give highsec more risk and more reward. then not only would it be a place worth living in, but if people wanted to transition to low, null, w-space then they'd have to get used to fewer new risks. basically a safer highsec creates a bigger barrier to try any other type of space. some more interesting missions would be nice, and improving the new player experience would really help. the one thing eve needs is something to do when you are alone. all the group content is great, but sometimes everyone you know is signed off or just doing something else.i am guessing you are talking about the lp store. the lp store is a good thing. first if solves a lot of isk faucet problems (because lp is essentially just gear waiting to exist). also rather than just making it rain isk it means the market value of your lp stuff is based on how many people are running any given site. if the sisters of eve only gave out lp that could be spent on sisters probes and launchers then their price would be dependent on how many people were farming sisters of eve missions. the demand for probes stays the same but the supply changes based on how many people are running the missions.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"

6/13/2012,"i'm sure there's supposed to be a point there, somewhere, in that post."
6/13/2012,"i do like the idea, though i think this would fit in the process a little more smoothlyhave players who undocks, re-dock, then undock again, wait 2 minute for abuse of station services.basically a cooldown if you undock twice under a small amount of time.i like your idea though"
6/13/2012,"station games are awful, i'm pretty sure everyone in eve would agree to get rid of them if it meant noone else could use them either."
6/13/2012,"i like the idea of a jammed target being unable to dock, sort of makes sense."
6/13/2012,"all that this would do is move gate-camping to station-camping. i mean why bother trying to maybe catch stuff on gates when with a sensor boosted ship, you are guaranteed to catch a target undocking that once scrammed cannot warp out or re-dock?it's pretty much a guaranteed kill and the victim has no way of knowing what is on the undock or within a short warp-in range.i agree that station games need to be addressed but you may want to re-think this proposal and consider a more balanced approach."
6/13/2012,"yes to ending station games, absolutely no to warp jammers stopping you docking a: there is no reason in game since you arnt warping, b: it would kill too many people who actually dont want aggression (ie people simply flying to a station to dock and getting ganked). rules must never be brought in that favours gankers over everyone else. ganking will an dmust always happen but it must not get any easier.to (mostly) have all stations kick out, you always end up 2500m from the station when you undock (reason being simple, teh station auto undocks you to avoid collision and doesnt release you to manual control until you are at a safe dstance)."
6/13/2012,warp scram preventing docking is stupid.a better solution would to be to extend aggression time when aggressing within a certain range of a station.
6/13/2012,"there's no reason that warp scrambling should prevent docking. it doesn't make sense. webifiers at least might interfere with being towed into the dock, which is how the game states your ship gets there. however, if i were a docking manager i certainly wouldn't allow any ship to dock under fire. i'd say that if they are actively taking damage they should be unable to dock. this gives people more options in finding ways to get docked up and doesn't create a zero-damage method for holding someone on top of a station indefinitely."
6/13/2012,"1.) preventing docking because you are warp scrammed has many, many problems... suddenly you can bubble/scram a freighter trying to leave and gank them. i think this will encourage station camping and station games, not eliminate it!!!!!! 2.) if you want to ""end"" station games, don't fight on a station! the current 10s session change timer, insta-undocks, and the like makes station camping much less effective. fighting on station is typically just a bad idea, as people can undock in anything from carrier logistics to whatever... draw people off of station, and if they won't leave their safety zone... go find someone that will!!!! 3.) while this is only partially related, the new crimewatch system [which is coming out soon(tm)] is supposed to transfer aggression timers to logi pilots that ""assist"" a currently aggressed party. this will really alter the station/gate games, and will solve much of the station game retardation!"
6/13/2012,"have the station guns that target any aggressor within 50km or so.if it was my place of business then i would defend my customers as they enter and leave.a few big guns and a warning should suffice:* * * * * * * * ** warning **you are about to engage in hostile activities withing a 50km radius of our station.you will loose standing against this corporation and face retaliation. do you want to proceed with this aggressive act?[ ] do not show this message again.* * * * * * * * for bonus points, you loose standing with whatever corporation owns the station.you could always target the station guns and blow them up too but at a huge standing and / or security status loss.

6/13/2012,"i don't need you to repeat yourself, i asked for a quote or a link regarding your claim about ccp saying such things. i'm not saying they didn't say it, but i have never seen such comments and well sadly it's not uncommon for posters to misrepresent what is just their own opinions as that of ccp. etc ... so, please clarify, or i'll just assume you're making it up.as for ""no more cloaking boosts"", there is no mmo that i have played where stealth/sneaky gameplay is weaker than it is in eve."

6/13/2012,"implement a new mod; a cloak disruptor; which would basically be an active sonar ping, and decloak cloaked vessels (possibly probability based on sig radius) within a certain distance (dictor sphere size). limit it to this new t2 destroyer class.possibly even have a targeting delay like a cloak; reducible by training skills.asw destroyers exist in modern navies, and this would add a counter to cloakies, and mean you wouldn't want to sit afk 10k off a gate."
6/13/2012,"not this crap again.all you do here is make things even easier for gate campers, and do nothing to address afk cloaking.afk cloakers would just move to safe spots.terrible idea.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."

6/13/2012,"1) how many solo gate camps do you encounter?2) gatecampers don't use dictors because they have deployable bubbles without them.if you're that scared of the big bad cloaker, go to another system.gatecamps get kills every day. how many times have you been killed by a cloaked ship?either you're a really terrible troll, or completely unimaginative. actually, you're definitely the latter. so i'll lay out the scenario for you: a gate camp sets up a drag bubble to pull people past a gate. then then place one of your new destroyers on the edge of that bubble spamming pings. anything that lands gets instantly decloaked, a fast-locking tackler pins it, and it dies a fiery death. these will become standard issue in every gate came in nullsec and cloaking will be useless for everything...except idling in a safe spot and intimidating carebears."

""fit all"" options in fitting gui. all ships highlighted should be fit with the fit that is currently active.on a more serious note: right now the ""fit"" button is a 70% solution that could easily be turned into a 100% solution by fitting up everything that is in the fit and not excluding items because they are rigs. 3. clicking ""fit"" should install all mods, all rigs, all drones, and everything in cargohold."
6/13/2012,"rigs are excluded because they can't be removed if you make a mistake. a warning message of ""if you use the rigs specified in this fitting they cannot be removed without destroying them. are you sure?"" would be a good compromise.mass fitting ships from saves would be useful for those who do such things. what i did as an alternative was create a stack for each slot in a container, select all and fit to ship. it let me hop between ships quickly and fit with minimal effort.i fully support the idea of being able to mass-fit identical ships. i'd like to see an option in the context menu for items that lets you choose the number of that item to fit to the active ship. that way when you want two eanms and three heat sinks and eight pulse lasers, you can place them with six clicks. currently the best way i've found is to shift-drag the lasers into 4 stacks of two, select all and fit twice...leaving one heatsink to fit at the end."

6/14/2012,some of the rules concerning noobs are universally applied to the system and it makes certain actions a bannable offense regardless of pilot age.

6/14/2012,"so i have been going over the math a bit (in eft so this might not be totally accurate to the game).let's say you got rid of the 10 seconds it takes to run the system scanner to find a haven, because it's annoying.ok so your average ship has a warp speed of 3 au / s. and if we assume the average warp from a gate to a belt or ratting site is 30 au. that's 10 seconds from entering a system to landing on grid.then we could pad that a little bit for aligning and landing. say 3 seconds to scan down a site, align, and warp to it. then another 3 seconds t land on grid and target someone. now we are up to 16 seconds.now let's give the defender 3 seconds of warning time to notice the hostile, align, and warp out. back down to 13 seconds.so assuming my numbers are correct (they aren't). a fair amount of time for someone to have a 50/50 shot of safing up when they see someone in the new intel tool is about 13 seconds.then you could adjust that detection time upward and downward from that initial fair time of 13 seconds based on based on the sensor strength of the detecting ships, the signature radius of the detected ship, their distance in au from one another, and any other in game stats that were appropriate.granted i am sure 13 seconds is a little inaccurate, it might be worth going on the test server and using a stop watch while warping to different sites.and now for a networking traffic tutorial.the current d scan sends a query to the server whenever you press the d-scan button. that's why doing it more than once every 2 seconds bogs down the server.for a new intel tool the server could just pipe all the relevant information to the users client once when they enter system, then a little bit here and there whenever something in local changes, people logging on or off, docking and undocking, and jumping in and out of system. then the client would handle all the intel tool math and feed you info (as per game mechanics) based on local data and wouldn't have to query the server every 2 seconds for you to press the d-scan button.also an intel tool that makes you press a button every 2 seconds is dumb. that stuff should happen automatically.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
6/14/2012,try it again.maybe you never played with eve. eft not helping you when you need experience of play.30 au long warp distance from entering a system to landing on grid isn't 10 seconds long time. that's more than 34 seconds with a hurricane (3 au warp speed) from 0 speed.edit: personal attack removed - isd stensson
6/14/2012,"actually, the reason it was tuned down to a minimum of 2 second delay, was because of bots. the average cpu usage pr person went down noticeably when that was implemented, because the dscan was something bots used extensively."
6/14/2012,"man dont talk stupid things.automaticaly intel ? lol network traffic tutorial ? i've never seen dumbest things.you want a more server intensive queries for all players ???already not all players use directional scanner, maybe just 10-20% of players using and they not using that continuously. every times when scanner refreshing datas the server need to send all scannable objects to the clients of players. that's would be generate massive lag if all players need to get datas continuously and automatically from server.that'ss why bad idea directional scanner spamming every two seconds or automatically dscan, and this delayed local should be generating more active dscan spamming to see enemies, because all players need to use this when they dont see local instantly.so, delayed local is a bad idea just a lag generator."
6/14/2012,"wow the pro local intel crowd really are grasping at straws. now i'll certainly concede there may be particular issues with my proposal that need to be addressed, some already have been in the course of this thread, but the whole 'dscan would cause massive network lag so we have to keep things as they are' argument borders on the ridiculous. thanks for finally providing a link travelbuoy, however, the link didn't show ccp saying the same thing as you were stating, merely that they didn't want players updating dscan more frequently than 2 seconds. well, guess what i'm not suggesting dscan be able to be updated faster than 2 seconds either. an automated system doesn't mean it has to update constantly. in fact my suggestion for dscan was that it would operate based on three perimeters, scan range, scan angle, and frequency of scan, with more of one meaning less of another. meaning at max range and a max scan angle of 360 the frequency dscan would update would be very slow. at max frequency speed it would be covering a small area of space.now in regard to any of this causing network lag, that's an issue of ccp fixing their code, because crappy code shouldn't be an excuse for holding onto crappy gameplay mechanics."
6/14/2012,*sigh* it's not causing network lag.
6/14/2012,"man, the dscan was instantly before patch which is changed to 2 sec. the ccp said same things what travelbuoy linked:""ccp atlas: ""there is a new 2 second delay in using the directional scanner. this has been done for server performance reasons.""everyone can understand this who want. you just trying to evade.""an automated system doesn't mean it has to update constantly"" that's mean update to everyone and send automatically all data from server to all client which connected the server.sometimes this means 40-50k players. this is at least 10x times more data queries. so, you wrong again.delayed local not supported. and this is just the one problem but not the last one."
6/14/2012,"by the pro-intel crowd, i presume you mean rib and travelbouy. i resent being grouped together with them. i just think this is too big of a change. its nice to see someone trying to logically and objectively put together argument even if it is using eft. buy you have to remember that people aren't looking at local all the time. even if hypothetically someone were checking local every two seconds, that's still a potential 2 seconds less time for someone to react and warp out. i would guess i probably check local every 5 or so seconds. and i check local alot.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
6/14/2012,"ok, but your question was in response to a particular statement made by me that you quoted. i said ""there is no mmo that i have played where stealth/sneaky gameplay is weaker than it is in eve.""then you quoted that and said ""are there any other mmos where losses matter to the same degree as well?""that to me implies you accept my statement as true, but consider it a reasonable state justified by your rhetorical question that followed. maybe it would be best if you simply clarified what exactly it is you're trying to say."
6/14/2012,it's almost like i haven't said this:siiiiigh.
6/14/2012,"i'm not sure what it is you think i'm trying to evade? i should clarify that automatic doesn't mean that every player in the game has it running, as it's still something that ought to be initiated. however, what if every player did have it it running, the server has to register all kinds of things with every player/client in the game, why should the information provided by dscan be any different? your grasping at straws to defend keeping local intel, nothing more."

6/14/2012,"no, i was mostly ignoring whether or not it was true or false, and going off on a completely different tangent which would then double back to prove a point.anyhow, i've had a think, and i can only really think of two games where losses actually matter, darkfall and mortal online. i haven't tried either of them, but i believe at least one of them is without a ""show people near you"" style, i.e. i've seen tons of people get robbed by people who just followed them out of eyesight. the problem with comparing this game to eve, however, is a matter of scale and how things work. in the other two games, rpgs, the act of sneaking up on someone is something which takes a fairly long while, giving the victim ample time to unscrew his head and spot the perp. in eve, however, if the hunter isn't bad, he'll be able to cut the response time from when he's visible on a 14au directional scan, till he's got you locked and warpscrammed, down to 6 seconds or so. while this may sound like ample time, and it would be if there were something other than the mindnumbing activities of mining or ratting for hours on end to contend with, the mere fact that the hunted is sitting around and not doing overly much stimulating means that the chances of the dscan warnings coming in time to allow the guy to take evasive maneuvers are pretty slim. your idea of cutting down the distance the broader width you scan down to 1au cuts the response time down to however long it takes for someone to slow down from warp sufficiently to start locking you.i mean, it's not like the 30 seconds or whatever is the current best time from appearing in local, till you can land on someone if you do everything right is preventing that many from dying like muppets, so i'm not sure why the urgency to change this (well, in caliph's case, the reason is fairly clear cut, he just wants ganking to be easier so he'll suck less).the lag isn't even the thing you should be overly worried about (even though it would put an added strain on a server during 1000+ fights). the main problem with the idea of switching over to a dscan style intel gathering, is that it drastically cuts down the possible response time of the hunted, and puts literally all the initiative in the hand of the hunter. however fun it might be for a while (and believe me, if this change did come to pass, i'd dust off my t3 and go to town all over the place), it just strikes me as a bad game balance change."
6/14/2012,"i played beta for mo, and beta and live for some time on darkfall, as i recall neither showed other players that were near you, perhaps mo had some function like that on the live servers but i doubt it. i don't think uo did, and shadowbane didn't although it did have tracking which might be thought of as a more powerful dscan. shadowbane also had slightly less severe losses on the individual level since you couldn't loot equipped gear, but it did get damaged and anything in your pack was lootable. there's a commonality between all these games, they're sandbox pvp focused mmos with full or in the case of shadowbane partial loot, but unlike eve stealth as a tactic is much more viable because none have the equivalent of local chat.where i do agree with what you seem to be saying zim, is in the sense that it really isn't ideal to have a system where hunting and ambushing others is nearly as effortless as it is currently in evading such predation by using local. it should require effort and player skill to find, ambush, and kill someone. but, it should also require effort and player skill to evade, escape, and defend from other players. presently local chat offers all that on silver plate, free from all but the tiniest portions of player effort and skill.balance is a rather subjective thing, but i am looking for a balanced outcome. if you accept the notion that accessing the valuable farms and fields of the game should mean being subject to the potential of unwanted pvp combat and that it should be possible for players to be able to both sneak about and predate other players then there's hope of coming to common ground here. from those that accept those things i really appreciate criticism and the presentation of alternate ideas, from those that don't it's largely a waste of time, since we want an entire different type of gameplay that isn't compatible.this discussion in one form or another needs to happen as removing local and adding cloak hunting are both on ccps mind."
6/14/2012,"""ccp atlas: ""there is a new 2 second delay in using the directional scanner. this has been done for server performance reasons.""but do you know better than any ccp dev.oh man.delayed local generating more lags. why ?because all players need to use always the dscan continously. ccp dont want to create from a stupid idea a massive laggenerator.and wasting server resources for this stupid delayed local it's a fail. easy to understand."
6/14/2012,"sigh. you didn't read my post, did you? i'm also going to guess that you haven't seen the devblog which they gave out after they did the change, where they said that the average cpu usage per player dropped by around 10% or so. and i'm fairly certain they mentioned bots being the main culprit behind why they did the change.so yes, it uses cpu on the server side. i've also said it does. it's still not the biggest problem with the idea of removing local."
6/14/2012,"ok learn to read a post before you criticize it. also some comprehension of network traffic would help too.ok let me dumb this down for you.let's say you had one shared document between 10 users. each user needs to see the changes that each other user is making to the document (remember google wave anyone?)so the dumb way of doing it that you think we are talking about, is to keep everyone up to date by constantly downloading the entire document every 2 seconds.the clever way is for everyone to download the document once when they first see it. then when one user makes a change, the server pipes that change to everyone else looking at it. if no changes are made for half an hour then nobody gets a change from the server. if one person makes one small change then everyone else only gets broadcasted the one change and not the whole document.now replace the word ""document"" with ""stuff in system with you"" and ""changes to the document"" with ""different stuff comming in and out of local""so you have 10 guys ratting in a system for half an hour. local hasn't changed, nobody has docked or undocked, jumped in our out, so they don't get an update on what's in local from the server.now an 11th person comes into local. the other 10 clients are piped the info on the new ship (not a full d-scan query) and their clients start doing the new intel tool gameplay timer thing locally so it doesn't bog down the server.the 11th person comming into local doesn't have an up to date copy of what's in local. so their client does a full query (pretty much the same amount of data in a regular d-scan) then like everyone else their client starts doing the new intel tool gameplay timer thing locally so it doesn't bog down the server.and as long as these 11 people are floating around in space without anyone leaving or comming in the server won't pipe any more data to any more people until something changes.automatic intel tool, time based detection, low network traffic.and i'd be willing to bet this ""only update on new information"" trick is how most shared chat channel programs work too. if that's the case then this new intel tool wouldn't add any more network traffic than being in one additional chat channel. and someone coming into local wouldn't cause any more lag than them saying hello in a chat channel.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
6/14/2012,"no, you just evade. simple you answer is not true.never was the problem the botters for dscanners. link it where they wrote. but you wont be find it, because this ccp answer is not existing.maybe you need to read the old devblogs again.the real problem that was, everyone spammed the scanner buttons, i'm too and those server packet asking generated too much lag. (botters was just a little part of players 1 or 2 percents)"
6/14/2012,"if you just look at local as something which you glance at to ""get intel"", then yes, it's ""no effort"". the effort aspect comes in when you factor in the need to keep constant watch, hour after hour. there's a reason people keep getting caught.the main problem i have with this is that i think the risk/reward of nullsec for the individual pilot is, right now, ""mostly okay"". if it's made more risky, the thing that'll happen is that people'll just go back to l4s in hisec instead, because the risk/effort/reward makes more sense than it would do in nullsec with this change.where i'd prefer to see more danger, however, is more on the alliance level, to encourage more skirmishes over systems, which i believe is a bit more of the right place to do tweaks."

6/14/2012,"1.) it's currently very difficult to catch an alert ratter/miner... and even unalert miners/ratters that actually practice safe habits are very hard to catch. 2.) we all know you like the notion of sneaking around, and you like the notion of ganking the gatherers of eve. both of these start off with good intentions of adding more risk to the game and enhancing the ""cloaky"" playstyle. on the surface, i fully believe that nullsec needs more risks, and that allowing people to ""hide"" is a good thing. however, a balance between the hunters and hunted is extremely important to maintain for a healthy lowsec/nullsec. ccp tends to lean game mechanics in favor of the hunted, and for good reason. overhunting results in the extinction of your herd!! xorv, in general your proposal overwhelmingly supports the hunters (especially cloaked hunters), the consequences of which i think you're oblivious or willfully ignorant of. when the people you hunt cannot truly defend themselves nor have a realistic opportunity to detect you and get safe before they are within your gun's sites, you break the predator prey balance! last i read, your proposal really lacks any viable options for the hunted to counter your cloaky-sneaky ganks. think about it: i can make 15m an hour (easily and very safely) in highsec running missions and the like. in most of nullsec, the rewards are not that much greater. pretend i can make 30m an hour (which is not nearly as common as you'd hope). pretend i'm thrifty, which means i make this ratting in an 60m isk drake. to keep pace with my highsec counterpart, i would need to rat ~4 hours before losing a drake. do you really think that's possible with your scheme? there's only 3000 nullsec systems, and only 20% of those are actually regularly used. with an average of 25,000 players online, how many of those ratting systems can be successfully ratted for 4 hours before a cloaky gang destroys them???"

6/14/2012,"the thing is, though, is that there are quite a lot of people who have said 'to hell with my opposing faction's standings, i just love enemies abound (or w/e)', and don't decline anti-faction missions. some of these are rpers, to be sure, but i can't be the only person to have noticed that, once you hoover all of those tags from 'smash the supplier' up, the collective pay (including loot, as well as everything else) is often substantially better than a similarly sized lvl4 mission. it is for this reason that i love anti-faction missions.i'm not 100% convinced that this would just be another gushing isk faucet. what happens if, as you say, the number of people running them drops, and the price of faction equipment goes up? well, surely in a sandbox environment like ours, quick thinking people will recognise this and move into doing faction missions to take advantage of the premium that tags would now command. presumably this would continue until equilibrium had been achieved.you also said that people might not have to wait at all before declining missions, and they might therefore just mission away without any impediment. however, the reality of the situation is that - provided your faction standings are high enough - you can essentially decline mission after mission with really negligible faction hits. i would also say that perhaps mission travel times are a bigger factor than declining missions, but that's just my opinion and not really relavent here :)thank you for your input so far!"
6/14/2012,ccp is working on faction war right now. lots of players are suggesting that players must kill all rats in order to cap a plex. if ccp actually does that you will see tag prices drop fast.amarr currently basically has to kill all the rats in order to run a plex. take a look at the cost of minmatar tags over the last few months. they pretty much tanked. i anticipate this will continue because the incentives to run plexes has gone up. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
6/14/2012,"that's probably quite a big 'if', and might not fully solve the intrinsic problems with the lp store - tag drop relationship that exist at the moment. a lot of it, in my opinion, stems from the godawful distribution of anti-faction missions."

6/14/2012,"oh, thanks for filling me in on all this.yes, i remember mynxee and was a member of her brainstorming blog ""making low-sec work"". yes, i made a lot of those same suggestions there too, and i think i even absorbed some of those ideas from mynxee's blog.i have no idea why ccp would just strait out ignore those ideas. i really think some or all of those are good ideas. it's a good way to get people out of over-crowded high-sec, and give them an alternative to null-sec. considering pirates for a moment. low-sec is pretty much all about pirates and faction warfare. pirates from earth history around 1600's were usually sailors from a country's navy. not everyone in the navy was happy about it, and it wasn't always voluntary either. sometimes you were knocked over the head and woke up on a ship in the atlantic wearing a sailor's uniform. ship mutinies were one way of dropping the shackles of state and belonging to a somewhat democratic crew of pirates and finding new land to call your own. if high-sec was overcrowded monarchistic europe, and null-sec was the undiscovered wilds of the american continent, then low-sec would have been those 'free ports' that were established, frequented and maintained by pirates. the emphasis here is on 'free ports', as in trade hubs in low-sec. despite the work that has gone into creating the backgrounds of the various pirate factions (blood raiders, guristas, etc.), a lot of pirates at least seem to be two-dimensional. it's not even about ransom anymore, it's just about blowing up people's ships. sure, there are some exceptions. what low-sec should be is a place where high-sec dissidents move. the original thirteen colonies in america were a place where religious dissidents (i.e. pilgrims) could settle without persecution. england at the time would have been 'safer', but like high-sec, was also crowded, heavily policed, with fewer opportunities. the american frontier was more dangerous, but a place where you could more easily make a living. similarly, there are some amarrians who are abolitionists (or atheists), just as there are some minmatar who are former slaves and still follow the amarrian faith. these people would likely have difficulties fitting into their high-sec societies. the stories are there in some of the missions, they just haven't been developed far enough. i guess ccp has decided low-sec should only be for faction war, which they have apparently improved upon slightly (and arguably). personally, i think the low-sec only casinos and pleasure palace stations would really do it. it makes sense to have casinos and pleasure palaces in low-sec. high-sec space is an authoritarian hellhole (at least caldari and amarr), and null-sec is too far away and too dangerous. low-sec is close enough to safety and population for customers but far enough from the eyes of of the law. drugs, gambling, slavery, brothels, and whatever else would be located here. also, people love smuggling, but there is no real smuggling mechanic in game. why not make some smuggling missions that pay a lot more than regular boring courier missions, but are only available in low sec?casinos turned las vegas from a crossroads in the desert to a bustling city. casinos are planned for the space hotel under construction as a way to attract tourists into space. how else are you going to make a town in the desert or a space hotel a profitable venture? nobody with money wants to invest that money in a risky venture, but they have no problems placing it all on a number on a roulette wheel. there are already tons of 'eve isk' gambling casino applications independent of ccp. a casino would be both an isk sink and an isk faucet. it would be a real reason for high sec 'carebears' to come out to low-sec, and it would really help develop some more low-sec trade hubs. eve wants to be 'seedy and dark'? well, consider where most of the seedy and dark stuff happens. it happens in a bar, on the 'bad side of town'. mos eisley's bar in star wars, rick's place in casablanca. there would probably have to be some special storyline missions, maybe epic arcs in low sec systems too. these would only be available at the special 'casino' stations. i would have missions based upon the 'dissidents' that moved out to low-sec, like the amarrian abolitionists, caldari socialist communes, monasteries, cults, etc. this is the same with every story, throughout human history. it is the heroic myth cycle in joseph conrad's ''the hero with a thousand faces'. first, the hero is safe at home, then there is the 'call to adventure'. the hero refuses at first, but is drawn in. then he 'crosses the threshold' into adventure. that threshold should be low-sec. the intrigue doesn't happen in high sec 'mom's house', it doesn't happen in the middle of the null-sec 'haunted house', it happens in the 'low-sec' school yard where the kid is confronted and takes a challenge from the bully. i don't know, maybe move the militia sign up office to low-sec?"
6/14/2012,"[quote=rico minaliall of these things were discussed alot a couple of years back in a thread titled outlaw, teh support was massive. ccp ignored it.devs got a few of the more colourful lowsec leaders to form a discussion group under the direction of mynxee. we discussed things a little and when it became apparent ccp had no intention of taking any notice we left teh discussion.my corp moved to nullsec after living in lowsec for years, because many of teh things coming in made lowsec even worse, capital blobs, 'roaming' pairs of supercaps. titans in lowsec, no income etc etc etc. many of the old guard of lowsec eventually went to nullsec because to be honest there was no real reason not to. we loved lowsec. we moved out because lowsec has never had any attention given to it. fw was not the way to steer it. in itself a nice creation but that isnt what teh majority of people who lived in lowsec wanted. they wanted a unique gaem experience, as different from empire and nullsec as they are different to each other. look up outlaw on teh old forums, it would have made lowsec awesome.also.. incursion, they should be lowsec only as it is the only place they make sense from a storyline perspective and it would be a thing that draws players there. [/quote]yes, you are right in that it makes sense for incursions to happen only in low sec. what does 'low-sec' mean after all? low security, not no security. you would also think that concord would be right on top of their butts for invading the system, instead of making sure that people don't shoot each other."
6/14/2012,this keeps on popping up because new noobs keep joining up. just because an idea keeps one getting rehashed doesn't make it automatically somethig that needs to be fixed. it just tells you that people coming from other games have a hard time adjusting to some eve specific ways of thinking and playing and they inevitably rant on the forums for a while before they 'get it'.the veterans that even bother to respond to you on the forums are a minority make no mistake. the large number of vets don't even bother responding to posts about the same topic that have been shot down years ago. your 'new' opinion doesn't make it any more viable than it was the first time it was brought up.

6/14/2012,ccp changed this in 2003 :pthey wont support this.
6/14/2012,"i can agree to this if 2 things are changed. 1. all cloaky ships have a lot more tank (sb in particular).2. this new destroyer is paper thin and has a long targeting delay (not reducable by skills). targeting delay at 30s would be good. and applies to all ships that are with the destroyer on grid.my solution is much simpler. stop trying to greatly change game mechanics of a class of ship to fit your paranoia. we get it, afk cloakys really bother you. get over it. you could also counter the entity that is afk cloaking you by doing same."
6/14/2012,"trying to relieve stress symptoms, paranoia and fear of the unknown by game design changes is a bad idea. but can be done by removing other players from the sight range of the offended party.out of sight, out of mind.afk cloakers do not run into gatecamps, so proposing a ship that can decloak a cloaky ship is irrrelevant since you can not scan down an afk cloaker in the first place.having a module that decloak ships within a certain range means that cloaky ships will move out of range of that module and you'll be no better off than before.what you want is a module that will make a systemwide cloak wipe, warp cloaky ships to your location so you can kill them and continue with your riskfree nonfactor carebearing ways in null. this will never happen."
6/14/2012,"clearly more than you judging by the rest of your comments.let me put it this way; as you clearly still don't get the reference to interdictors:imagine a world without interdictors; and then ccp propose a t2 variant of the destroyer; and a new module that will drop a temporary bubble that will prevent ships warping.you post to the thread a whine about how 'it will make gatecamps much easier' and how 'fast aligning ships don't do much dps anyway so you are not at risk'.they clearly were not valid arguments then, as we have interdictors; so i don't see how the same arguments are valid now.i'd actually have the ship be less effective at it's role than a dictor is it it's own role; because i think cloakies should get a chance. yes, if you had a camp consisting of several perma pinging asw ships you would uncloak everything on the gate; but that would be expensive, and massively limit the dps your fleet can do.and yeah, i would want a 30 second locking delay after a sonar ping. tbh the dictor should have one too after dropping it's bubble."
6/14/2012,"just drop it. your taking up valuable room on the front page of the assembly hall.you are getting so much opposition it should be clear to you that your idea will never see implementation.also, using a drag bubble and a can will work better than the ship your proposing. so it will never be cost effective. no one would use it anyway.take a hint.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"

6/15/2012,"i can assure you nothing i have said has been a fabrication, the accusation leaves me crestfallen. as far as ""terrorizing"" goes... an afk player cannot terrorise anyone, in fact the nature of their being prevents them from doing anything at all! if you feel ""terrorized"" that is a result of your own mental state, and ccp should not have to invent mechanics to coddle your damaged psyche. if you don't like that red/neutral in system with you, then go to another system. or get a fleet together defend against him if he should make a move. or ignore him. as the saying goes, htfu. i am absolutely against afk tags because you do not need, nor deserve, even more detailed information about what potential enemies are up to. you must work for it, or make do without.anti-cloaker tears fuel my cloaking device, thats why it is seemingly infinite."

6/15/2012,you've changed nothing you are still a terrible troll.
6/15/2012,"ok on this issue your both preaching to the choir. as i've stated all over these forums i believe the valuable farms and fields should all be in dangerous space. high sec should either be made much more dangerous or have it's pve gutted, this is the norm for mmos that describe themselves as ""sandbox"" and build themselves around conflict. pre trammel uo, shadowbane (except newbie zone) darkfall, and mortal online all have their pve in areas outside the protection of npcs. eve should be the same, and if it were, all these concerns that players will flee to high sec will vanish.the whole idea that you separate pve from pvp is from themepark mmos. when players go to do pve activities in eve it should be also with pvp in mind. even the crappiest pve content becomes interesting when you add pvp into the mix. however, if you add any pve content that is both free from the risks of pvp and remotely close to the same rewards, it becomes the most efficient means of gaining the rewards of pve, and thus just about everyone feels compelled to only do that form of pve. this is what has already happened to eve, and why so many characters are in high sec already compared to the rest of space. this issue of high sec pve isn't a reason to reject my proposal, it's reason for us all to put pressure on ccp to fix the problem of largely pvp free pve in a sandbox mmo."
6/15/2012,"as someone who's flown in nullsec for a good amount of time, i agree that local is simply too much and too easy of an intel gatherer. the idea of stealth does not work when everyone is alerted of an intruder's presence. what i propose is a 30 second delay for local update for both parties. what i propose for cloaking is that the inorder to receive intel update, the pilot must remain uncloaked for 30 seconds to receive intel up. if he cloaks before the 30 second timer complete, it restarts. but at the same time his presence will not be revealed as long he remains cloaked and does nothing. if he remains uncloaked for 30 seconds his presence will be revealed. if the cloaked pilot warps however, he will be revealed in 30 seconds even while under cloak. stealth will have more meaning in the game and more deaths to ratting bots."
6/15/2012,"you can't travel through a system within 30 seconds, so your proposal does nothing to hide your pressence. the only stealth in your idea comes from entering a system, cloaking, and slowboating into a position while cloaked. this isn't all that appealing to me...also, 30 seconds is a very long time to remain out of local. imo, that's too long, as a quality skirmisher will be in warp to a target before appearing in local. imo, 10-15 seconds is a much more reasonable vale. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++i really think the best solution is for the entrance of a player into system to be announced quickly to all people in system.... this means everyone becomes alerted to a new person in local. however, no information (who they are, what they fly, etc) is given on the new player until they get reconned them through an intel system. cloaky ships can't be reconned, and remain anonymous. then, you can travel through a system, and if nobody recons you, you are just an anonymous traveler... it gives skitish ratters warning enough to get safe. as long as the intel system does not automatically transmit information about who is blue and who is neutral, systems with lots of blue traffic become easy to sneak through, and require sentires to identify hostile traffic. as long as there are no static structures to autoscan (pos modules, sov upgrades), then the value of intel is significantly increased!"
6/15/2012,"so ccp said they want it to be use by both new and older players. here's a simple idea that may actually do that.new module for the rorqual: ore jump portal generator.the range should be the same range as the rorqual's jump range.only ore frigs. can jump with it.this way small corps or groups of friends have a 'new' idea for an op. ninja mining in npc 0.0, or whatever fun ninja mining shenanigans. still has a bit of risk, because you'll have to fly these ore frigs into lowsec to get to the rorqual (the very good reason why i didn't say orca). unless of course the rorqual is a bad-ass and is carrying some of these and jets them for people to use.old players may want to do it, new players can tag along an feel cool because everyone but the rorqual and scout are in the same ship. helps make mining a bit more fun, back to group ops where people sit in voice coms shooting the **** and drinking beer."

6/15/2012,"that would actually be better in many respects, and solve at least one of the other problems you mentioned, (and possibly the ecm burst problem, since the bodyguard could pack eccm -- il admit i didn't think of ecm burst being too effective...) but let me explain why i didn't go that way from the beginning:1. unintended consequences going in the other direction. there's quite some interesting mischief one can possibly pull by target redirecting an unaware and unwilling target. by handing the responsibility of keeping the module activation to the bodyguard himself, we either reduce the options to control the relationship on both ends, or resign to things like 'lemme steal the shield rep from the opponent's logi'. which would be fun in a way, but a bit too chaotic, if you ask me. 2. avoiding the above would produce considerably more complicated module activation checks. for example, suppose that two people with beacon modules activate their beacons on a single industrial, and i try to target this industrial -- which ship of the three do i end up locking? can two people do that in the first place, and if they can't, how will the server prevent this? what about selecting which ship classes it can and cannot be activated on?i'd rather offer a suggestion as narrow as possible, if only because there's less chance of ""i know what your agenda is!"" flames otherwise. :) notice that this only works because in lowsec every non-blue is a target. however, should you really have to to shoot first, always? changes to the crimewatch system described in the fanfest presentation, particularly the sec status logic described, appear to be trying to create a situation wherein in low sec, a neutral can be just a neutral, and not necessarily someone you need to kill to mine at all. let me explain why i believe this is important:any 'not blue shoot it' situation promotes certain behaviors in players simply because players who don't do that suffer. in particular:1. if you aren't looking for a fight, but are instead looking for a resource to harvest, you will attempt to find a location where a hostile engagement is as unlikely as possible, ""watch local"", and avoid engagement whenever possible. (doing otherwise cuts into your income.) that leaves lots of resources unexploited at all, and in most cases, leaves you mining (and missioning) in high sec.2. if you are looking for a fight, everyone is avoiding you as hard as they can because of the above, so you spend lots of time roaming until you find an opponent, and more often than not, you instead find bait.in nullsec, large regions are populated by nothing but blues, due to the sov mechanics. but in lowsec, there's no sov mechanics and you never get many blues, so you shoot everyone and run from everyone. as a result, lowsec is a failed ecosystem, where everyone is forced to either be the predator, or the very quick and avoidant prey -- or avoid lowsec in the first place. there's very little middle ground, even if you cooperate, and the more you cooperate the more you become the predator by necessity. coupled with the crimewatch change, i believe the proposed change should create a more populous lowsec."
6/15/2012,"i would have been with you if you would have suggested that you could add training to the queue regardless of which char you added it from instea of like right now that you need to pause your training, log in with the other char and start training...but training on all chars on your account simultanously... no thank you."

6/16/2012,first of all you totally mix the concept of active and passive protection.second iirc eve projectiles and missiles only count where they were shot from and where they were shot to. then you just negate a percentage(not all of it!) of damage on the receiving end if it is within the range of the module. may even add a factor of how much distances is between the edge of modules range and the protected ship on the vector of projectile's/missile's path to determine the exact effectivness. this way a close range brawl would be more effective since the distances between the target are minimal at default which would potentially lead to the rise of blaster boat doctrines.add some special effects to make it beautiful so that the pilots that use them won't be bored.
6/16/2012,"yeah because you can tell who's a real rookie by their character age. alt accounts of vets are definitely rookie, and casual players who aren't online for hours every day to learn pvp are no longer ""rookie"" on day 15, right? you turn 18 today, son, now go hang with the big boys, nevermind that you're rolled as an industrialist.extend it to all of the 7% of systems in eve that is highsec and be done with it."
6/16/2012,"they should either extend it to no systems or all systems. not some grey area. eve is supposed to be a harsh place, full of danger.this really isn't helping to convey such a thing as advertised by ccp.new players could always test out their place on a seperate server [like sisi for instance or a new server dedicated to rookies].i like rookie pilots i really do, and most of the time they are not worth shooting because they have nothing of value [plus i usually have no reason to shoot them]. however if this kind of change is expected in future i might have to hire rookie pilots to shoot rookie pilots with a bonus reward for doing so. then lets see the gm's start banning rookie pilots."
6/16/2012,test server is for testing. the idea that sisi exist for noobs to learn is ridiculous.
6/16/2012,"anything in fw, now or later, will be abuse-able by the 'x-factor' thing as i think it is called basically a person on amarr and another on minmatar can coordinate and make massive amounts of lp this is possible now and it'll be possible later unless some serious restrictions are put in"
6/16/2012,"i believe several people have already addressed how having an afk tag would be detrimental, you are just copy-pasting the same poorly worded question and resorting to ad hominem instead of responding to any points they make."
6/16/2012,"you keep perpetuating the myth that the things you list matter. against highsec gankers none of those things work. your only chance of success is if they screw up, or didn't bring enough destroyers.you want to see a brawl between an apoc and an oracle? sure, if you are stupid you'd lose the oracle."
6/16/2012,you getting a new mining barge with battleship like ehp. now stop complaining.
6/16/2012,or if you are stupid you'd lose the apoc.
6/16/2012,"while i agree that most of these, ahem ""demands"" are pretty silly, i also agree that there really is no voice for hisec players. i remember the last csm election and not seeing any candidate who wasn't ultimately just a lobbyist for one nullsec alliance or another.i've seen this problem in other games. for example, back before ww2ol was merely circling the drain and not diving headlong into it, they had a player run ""high command"" system composed of players who acted as major domos and ran the campaigns. the problem, though, is that all of these ""hc"" were little more than front men for their own respective ""squads"" (clan, guild, alliance - same thing, different names). the result was that instead of actually running the campaign (i.e. their jobs) they just prattled around like a bunch of courtiers to get more of their own ""squaddies"" into the program & whine for the developers to change things to they way they, themselves, wanted it and to hell with everyone else.sound familiar?the problem, i believe, is a similar lack of requirements for what a player must do to be a csm. right now it's pretty much ""do you own a passport y/n?"" there is no actual rule against a current council member from buying their kid brother/sister a subscription & a passport, then telling everyone in their alliance to vote for that twerp the very next day. considering the size of some alliances, this is not as improbable as it seems.frankly, i'd like to see the csm positions be less about administrative garbage and more about various aspects of the game. there are nine csm positions, last i checked. why can't one of them be dedicated solely to voicing the concerns of hisec players? you could have a nullsec rep, a lowsec rep, and a hisec rep and still have six seats open to shuffle powerpoint slides & pretend to be important while getting drunk in iceland for two weeks a year.would that be unfair to ask for?"

6/16/2012,"the thread on hulkageddon showed the sharp division in the community.at a blunt level, highsec needs csm votes. not just getting the attention of the null sec crowd who don't really care, but its own voice on the csm itself. but to those who ridicule highsec players, know only this: ccp wants more players. they are not going to get them without increasing highsec player retention, so guess what, changes are going to happen whether you like it or not."
6/16/2012,"wtf do you mean ""highsec needs csm votes""? highsec has more representation than any other part of space since i believe every csm member is likely to have at least one character in highsec. in addition to that the csm has at least three members who's interests and campaign focus is on highsec; kelduum revaan, alekseyev karrde, and issler dainze. what more do you want?"
6/16/2012,"hello everyone.during the last couple of days i noticed something that should be changed. even though i'm pretty aware of that this is just a relatively minor thing besides issues like the wardec-system. never the less i'd like to explain it to you.topicskill name/description ""guided missile precision"" & ""target navigation prediction""guided missile precisionso as stated by the description, this is what the skill should do: (simplified)bringing the missile closer to the target, so that the missile explosion can deal more damage to it.what the skill actually does ingame:giving a bonus to a missile's explosion radius attribute by -5%conclusion:it means that the skill isn't described accordingly to the actual game mechanic or in other words: the appliance of a bonus of -5% to the missile's explosion radius has nothing to do with the accuracy, the point of impact and the signature radius of a missile.proposal: adjusting the skill name and description accordingly to the actual game mechanic.solutiontarget navigation predictionso as stated by the description, this is what the skill should do: (simplified)it predicts a target's navigational course to intercept the target in order to negate the target's velocity in order to apply full damage to it.what the skill actually does ingame:giving a bonus to a missile's explosion velocity attribute by +10%conclusion:it means that the skill isn't described accordingly to the actual game mechanic or in other words: the appliance of a bonus of +10% to the missile's explosion velocity has nothing to do with the optimization of a missile's flight path and the negation of a target's velocity.solutionhopefully this will find at least a bit of attention and is replied to in a constructive manner.for those of you, who are familiar with the german language, this is the full post on this topic in the german forums:aenderungsvorschlagfly safe,ben fenix"
6/16/2012,"is the the world of eve polarizing to 0.0's vs the rest of everyone else?wardec nerfs, ccp supports unfairness.i would have thought that making wars a 'free for all escalation' was what 'inferno' was all supposed to be about. maybe this post is old news, but i thought it would be fair to point this out to csm. i have to say i am leaning on the side of the poster.i think a proper sandbox should allow bullies to get bullied back."
6/16/2012,"i'm not much of a conspiracy theorist, but i have to say that that poster makes some very good points. i don't know if it was goon influence or not, but i think that what that person described, being able to turn a wardec around with some allies and force the would-be attacker to pay for a surrender, seemed like the exact thing the new wardec system was designed to encourage. this change does seem like a bit of a ""you can turn the tables on them, but only if they're small enough that 1-4 allies can do the job"". i agree with some of the changes being made, like 2-week contracts. but that poster does make some very valid points about how those changes very strongly favor large alliances and make it difficult for a defender to turn the tables on an aggressor (by exponentially scaling the ally cost and removing the ability to lock someone into a war with you and your friends, with the changes the aggressor will just drop the dec if they're losing and shrug it off)."
6/16/2012,"i think it's more a case of people abusing it to lock hundreds of corps into permanent wars, weather they like it or not."
6/16/2012,jade used a known problem/exploit which could enabled to parcipiants to join war for 0.0 isk and what the testers reported to ccp when the patch was in test phase on sisi. ccp didn't fixed their fails (reported ui and wardec problems) before they released infeno. everything else just a conspiracy theory.
6/16/2012,actions and consequences.
6/16/2012,"i'm personally of the belief that it was right to stop people who make a war mutual from being able to hire allies.all of the other changes however, are in bad taste as far as i'm concerned. its just another nerf to the little guys. the auto-renew and cost changes in particular.as to whether its the csm and mitanni trying to influence ccp? well, who knows? i certainly can't make that call. but i do think ccp sees the big alliances as being somewhat integral and some kind of amazing part of the eve online universe (and i would agree to the latter), and therefore pander to their needs a little more than they should.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
6/16/2012,"no this wouldn't really change much at all, since i'm sure organized alliances and bot programs would figure out some way to communicate the presence of friendlies in a system, and then by process of elimination easily know if a new ship entering a system was a neutral/hostile. if you combined your ideas above with a new chat that was regional wide not just system wide, then it would be a real improvement. i swear i recall even zim suggesting someplace that local become a regional chat. it's not my preferred option but it would be a marked improvement over what we currently have."
6/16/2012,well that depends on how well the frigs will mine and how much fuel it will cost to jump them. easily fixed with role bonuses and such.
6/16/2012,"what does the csm think of the changes to factional warfare - not from the play fw players perspective. from the perspective that more and more game content - expects to peoples to be involved with fw. the 2 changes that i am referring to are data cores, and now clothingso my questions are: do you think the changes to fw which affect the greater eveverse are a good thing ? if so why what do you think the end game of fw interns of player involvement should be - i.e something you can to do or something that you have to do with respect fw - do you see that the game should always evolve around these factional wars ? how do you think null sec alliances should be involved in fw . what changes to the game mechanics are required ? to what limit should fw intrude into null sec politics ? just curious about what we people think fw meanscheers and beers ramm"

6/17/2012,"i somewhat agree with option 1, though i believe that it should be based off of how contested the plex is, not the systemthe reason i say this is because i have come across several plexes in uncontested systems that have a wt in them, i go in, the wt flees and then i get to orbit a button to close the plex which yields no reward if a minor gets run down to 10s left on the button and then the wt leaves it, i still need to close that plex to lessen the chance that that system will become contested now i am not saying that the reward for orbiting defensively should be the same as offensively however, i do believe that there should be some form of reward, perhaps 1/4 the value of offensive plexingif the plex was opened by a member of the non-sov holding militia, then that plex should pay out a reward if closed either way, whether the attacker finishes it or a defender comes along and closes it"
6/17/2012,"actually i agree with this if it were based off how contested the plex is, it would be very abuse-able as people with alts could come in and shortly contest a plex and then you could just def-plex it for lp this would actually lead to even more of a problem than current-day offensive plexing if it were based off how contested the plex is then it would work out and would not be abuse-able by an alt"

6/17/2012,"so basically, we're all supposed to bend over backwards and change *fundamental* game play features for people who want to pay real money to fly ships they don't understand how to operate? talk about pay to win, no thanks. you seem to forget the many players who have been here through the years, and those like myself who are new and appreciate the game mechanics. i've been ganked, gate-camped, the whole nine yards, and you know what? it doesn't bother me, i usually try to ask the player questions and get advice afterwards.have you seen some of the killmails where people die in noob ships with 5, 10, even 30 plex in their cargohold? do you think ccp reimbursed them? no. because to do that would tamper with the fundamental philosophy of the game, and would drive away a lot more members than it attracts.just because you wanted to pay stupid amounts of real life money to immediately jump into a ship you don't understand how to fly properly doesn't mean you should be catered to over the people who form the rest of the community. i've bought plex as well, and you know what i do with it? i buy **** i can afford to lose. never fly anything you can't afford to lose. before you go whining about how we need to fundamentally change the game, why don't you, i don't know, experience some progression and learn the mechanics? why would you possibly want to just jump in completely alpha in every way (when it comes to mining)? we're supposed to respect that?don't assume everyone who has bought a plex is a stupid scrubnub about it. i did it to fund my corp, we operate within our means and it's working out. sorry it's kind of hard to just buy your way into mining-godhood. what a cheap and silly way to start playing a game. i mean, how much more can you complain? you're playing a game where you can shell out real money to leap-frog months or years ahead of other noobs in terms of skill and income and you want there to be no risk. guess what, if you could do all of that and not be at any risk of losing that expensive ship you bought with plex money, eve would effectively be pay to win. and you miners deserve that exclusive right why again?also, one more note, why do miners always portray their chosen profession as the default choice of the new player? it's always the same ""you're not hurting us, you're hurting the new guy!"" appeal. i'm new and i've never mined, neither have my corpmates, and we most likely never will, because that looks like a dreadfully stupid way to spend your time in a game."
6/17/2012,"i'm sorry, i didn't check how far this thread went on. my previous post is probably irrelevant at this point."
6/17/2012,"you're quite right it is broken, but you fail to see why, even after spelling out most of the relevant facts yourself in your own posts..simply in game like eve, the farms and fields which includes mining shouldn't be in what is high sec to begin with. it's because you can gather resources under the protection of concord/crimewatch that players resort to suicide ganking, and it's because of those same concord/crimewatch mechanics that player guards as you suggested simply don't work, it isn't ccp failing to deal with highsec ""griefers"" that has been holding back this game, most of those players are better thought of as part of the immune system response of the sandbox to unhealthy anti-sandbox gameplay. what's holding back eve from it's real potential is the themepark-ish game mechanics found in highsec, and ccp's unwillingness to really address that problem."

6/17/2012,"the problem with this is that ccp should really be sticking to their model of open sandbox and emergent gameplay, fair for all. if the current alliances burn then others will rise up to replace them. that is the sacrosanct idiom of eve. ccp should not pander to any particular alliance or demographic of eve, but make it possible for emergent gameplay to tear down existing systems and rebuild them, if the populace demands it. locking people into mutual wars is not good, but if a big alliance finds itself stuck in a war too big for them to handle, firstly, well too bad that it misjudged the ability of their victim to gather many friends to came to their aid, and secondly, well maybe they should be able to just swallow their pride and surrender.i agree that the whole 'protecting merc' idea is a sham. mercs should be hired guns to do operations in null or low. not highsec. merc's getting paid to grief some small time corp in highsec, is frankly, something that they should not be paid to do. that's like getting paid to gank. if only all of us could have that much fun while getting paid to do it.lower the ally escalation costs to at least equal those of the aggressor party and also take out the limit on the number of allys to at least be the same as the people you are fighting. i believe that any war should fundamentally be able to be 'equalized' in balancing the numbers. it really is a game of 'picking your allies' well, and knowing not to declare war on a party that has many friends.the counter argument of having a lot of small noob corps get stuck in wars is a sham and a red herring. no noob corp is stupid enough to join a war without being willing to pay the consequences."

6/17/2012,"oh please, is the pr/damage control so weak that it's reached the point of crying ""exploit! exploit!"" goonies started a campaign against certain outspoken members of the community - small corps or individual people - and wanted to utterly crush them or force them out of the game, unfortunately for goons their targets threw a few surprise punches back at them. that's a good thing, and not something that should be rushed to be patched out of the game."

6/17/2012,"wouldn't this, by definition, be ""player-side effort""?nevermind how bots would circumvent the system, since by that process of elimination removing local would make bots even more overpowered, since you could just put a bot account on each entrance to the system (and spread evenly across the solar system so you had a 100% coverage, too). and unlike humans, they wouldn't have a lapse in concentration. you have to design systems which would not make humans stab themselves in the foot so something else will hurt more.remember, this is a game, if you want proper cockstabbing it turns out you'll want 1.7.1 of dayz.yeah, i hate to tell you, but i was on a small troll-chain there, just to see how easy it was to get people to rage while on the ""other side of the fence"". turned out it was pretty easy in some cases."
6/17/2012,"there's a difference between giving people a tool for something that they need occasionally and enforcing a tool that they will need to run continuously (whether they choose to or not). unlike other mmos, eve runs in a single shard environment, which means, every single bit of globally frequent server queries will have be reduced to their minimum.simplified, the way it works now, for the dscan+local perspective, for every player in each system the client queried people available in that system, that's it, only when they pressed dscan, the client pulls out a request for space objects within that dscan scope on demand, even offgrid objects, which is not something that's queried automatically on every session changes. during a certain timespan, only a handful of clients would put such a request. even with this kind of mechanics, ccp decided to put a 2s delay on every dscan requests.with an automated dscan and delayed local, people will be forced to use this just to gather information which should be there in the first place, even with 5 or 10 seconds delay, imagine the increase of strain to the server would be, and remember, since (in a sense) local info is not there, people would be more likely to turn this 'feature' on.this is also not a matter of ""ccp should code it better"", no. this is how client-server communication works on mmos, it's not the issue of how big the packet size is for each instance, it's a matter of how frequent those requests are. let's say, 40k people are online at one time, say 1/8 of them are in space, so that's 5000, imagine a quarter of them plays in nullsec and ratting, or doing missions of something, so thats 1250, imagine almost half of them are using the automated dscan, so that 620 people. for a 2s delay, you're talking about adding 310 number of pings active, each second, continously, and that's even the best scenario possible, and judging by your idea of a (sort-of) removal of local, it should be at least twice or three times that number. so yes, the server-strain argument is indeed, valid.a good analogue, but it doesn't apply to this case. mmo packets are different than shared online documents, the biggest difference would be an extensive timeslicing on the server side caused by how frequent the packet requests are. on your analogue, it addresses the point where huge size file downloads are not necessary because of the incremental update. in mmos, a relatively small packets are sent and received continously throughout time on the servers. the main issue is the amount of packets received, not to mention the database queries needed before the server responded. this brings out another thing that differentiate eve and documents, it may be true, while clients can cache ship informations (hulls, character avatars, etc), we can't cache their positions and state, hence it's not as simple as sending ""an update of one change"".regardless, i'm not fully against the idea. the purpose of it, is nice, the solution offered however, imo might need another alternative. while it seemed balanced, people might view it as a complete nerf of local while not providing any incentive towards those who don't like it. this drastic of a change without any incentives rarely works. if you think the public emorage coming from the incarna expansion is bad? try removing local and see what happens.""i'd rather have other players get shot by other players than not interacting with others"" -ccp soundwave"

6/17/2012,"i have come to realise that the thing about eve for most of the older players is that there is no more wow factor for training for something you couldnt fly before. a lot of my mates seem to agree. so not being one to moan without thinking of something to help with, i have come up with two ideas that could help this situation and bring back some of the old faces that have dissapeared along the last two years i have been playing eve.nr1. as a quickish fix, ccp should bring out some more tech3 ships. such as tech3 bc or destroyer or even frigs.nr2. as a long term fix, they should bring out either a new race, or bring out jovian ships. the reason for this is they can make it so that we have to train brand new type of weapon, ships, support and a bunch of other skills. this will bring back the older players, give newer players a chance to also get into the new content almost on par with the older players in skill training terms and it will give me something better to train for than small blaster specialisation 5. just my thoughts."
6/17/2012,"the devs are having balancing ""issues"" with the current t3 ships... and t2... and t1... i don't think they want to introduce a new line of ships that may or may not be op until they have addressed all those other ones.and this is based on pure conjecture... i think they'd probably stick to only t3 frigs and battleships... for ""purity"" reasons (have you ever noticed that there are no faction/pirate destroyers or battlecruisers?) jovians are supposedly ""scary powerful"" compared to the rest of new eden. why would you want to introduce a technologically superior ship line ""just because"" and risk obsoleting every other ship currently in existence?a good example would be the jovian battleship; the eidolon. it has 8 high slots, 8 mid slots, 8 low slots, 8 turret hardpoints, 8 missile hardpoints, 400m3 of drone space, 125 m/bit of drone bandwidth, and enough cpu-pg to fit any fit you can think of with room to spare.oh yeah... it also has way better stats than any other ship in it's class.and no... high cost will not be a limiting factor... and high training requirements will only put such ships out of reach of younger players."
6/17/2012,"didnt i say new race or release jovian ships. or a less powerfull bastardised version...with all this rebalancing of ships they are currently doing, i am sure they have the skills to rebalance a new race's ships so that they arent totally op.as for current issues of rebalancing...this was more meant for something to think of to mid and long range plannings after dust's issues have been more or less resolved after the launch. i never even assumed ccp would attempt this now...but yea.next objection pls :p"
6/17/2012,"confirming that conceiving, designing, and balancing an entirely new range of ships and a range of subsystems to go with them would be a 'quickish fix'"
6/17/2012,"instead of just more new ships or new weapons (not that i am against it, but just it is only a temporary measure, and can only be done so many times, before you wind up again where you started, with people trained up to the maxx)why not make a system where players can create their own missions? sort of like a modding kit that will allow you to script missions and setup your own agents in your sov space? maybe event involve dust players eventually in these missions."
6/17/2012,"greetings,someone in 2011 suggested on the old forum a new container which is ancorable in 0.7 or lower sec space.it seems that eve began implementing this container, which is now found as an ""item"" however there doesn't seem to be any way to buy/build or invent it.i propose that this container finish construction. the concept which this particular container was formed from is sound.aude hem[atb]aetue bex"

6/18/2012,the mechanics and programming for something like that would turn out to be a pain in the ***.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
6/18/2012,"at the very least i think it would be a nice touch if the ship description said something along the lines of, ""developed with the help of otherworld enterprises"""
6/18/2012,maybe put a quote in from chribba in the description of the ship.
6/18/2012,how many chiribba can you fit though this hole?
6/18/2012,"there's an easy fix to bounty hunting. keep the current bounty system. simple. but instead of people being about to see the bounties on their head deny everyone access to that knowledge. nobody gets to see the bounty placed on their head. add a skillbook to become a bounty hunter. allows you access to bounty hunting mission agents. agent gives you a mission to hunt down a random person in your region with a bounty. the bounty hunter is not told the sum total of bounties placed on the wanted person's head, just that they have a bounty and that they need to die. say a time limit of a month or so to complete the bounty. you also get specific bounty hunter locator agents. perhaps special scanner probes, modules, etc. as you become a better trained bounty hunter, you get access to a wanted list that lets you pick your bounties from a randomly generated list of bounties in your area. the bounty hunter gets paid a baseline fee, eg the collective bounty placed on that persons head, for destroying the ship of said target, and additional bonus isk if you pod them. this will encourage both small scale solo bounty hunting, but group bounty hunting as well."
6/18/2012,"i was about to say something along the lines of ""if it was really that easy to fix then don't you think somebody else would have fixed it by now? but this actually isn't bad. make the bounties scale up with the skill level trained, ie you get bigger bounties given to you if you are high trained in the skill. only problem i see is local area is hard to define. people jump clone around a lot. would taking a bounty on somebody who leaves the area make you sort of stuck?"
6/18/2012,"then goons and other ne'er-do-wells completely wreck it by placing 1 isk bounties on each other, drowning out the ""real"" bounties"
6/18/2012,almost the entire proposal and much of the subsequent discussion revolves around addressing this issue. i mean like from the first paragraph.
6/18/2012,"if you're looking to get people to shoot at an entire lo-sec corp than i think that is better addressed through the wardec system and mercenary contracts, not bounties.by asking other players for advice, in the same way that a new player should before making any other similar sized purchase. this isn't and shouldn't be a game mechanics issue; it's a player interaction issue."
6/18/2012,once you have a bounty on someone the locator agents would track them no matter where they went. much as it works now. the skillbook or skillbooks would have long train times and even if you did want to potentially game the system it'd take some effort. but the only way you could collect the bounty would be to somehow magically get your main or alt with the bounty to pop up randomly and then gank yourself. the real reason why the bounty system is broken right now is because people know how big the bounties are on thier heads and then manipulate the system to kill themselves with an alt and collect the bounties themselves.
6/18/2012,"i didn't mention it but i would would assume that the higher price bounties would be lumped at the top of the randomized list to be doled out to bounty hunters. that would prevent low pay bounties from ""poisoning the well"" as it were and making people chase after bounties only worth a few thousand or hundred isk.more than one person could get the same bounty on the same person so there would be competition to collect heads."
6/18/2012,"one of the best low-sec improvement proposals could be found herethe reason i am posting this is because i feel that your first barrier is the need to increase the population actively using low-sec before you can introduce content such as in your proposal without an active population advocating for these changes, there is really little that will be done - which is why, for instance, most of the changes introduced in eve are 00 improvements, war dec changes, fw upgrades and so onthat thread may give you an idea of what is currently stopping the casual pvp-ers from going into low-sec i think this barrier needs to be overcome prior to introducing any new content"
6/18/2012,"i actually disagree with the majority of that post my corp lived in lowsec for years and those barriers are not barriers merely elements of what lowsec is about when we lived there, lowsec was actually quite busy, fights were easy to get, you could go to nearby busy places with entities that you could go to war with lowsec was great in those days (before fw had even been thought of) 100 ship bs fights were not uncommon, 30 man roaming gangs were very common, it was a good time the proposal above was originally written up a whiel after fw started to affect lowsec, when capital blobbing became normal to see in lowsec a little while after that we moved out of lowsec as it became totally boringdont make lowsec 'easier' it just needs more in it, alot more and some serious restriction on capital use"
6/18/2012,"it wouldnt need to all come in in one big patch i do actually know about moon mining as we run lots of it, most of what we do is very easily done in lowsec too adn our corp makes some 10 billion isk a month with about 12 towers, all on low end, common moons and some sensible importingremember this is actually an un edited, old post so some of it will be outdated and no longer viable"
6/18/2012,"this is true that's was nice days but now, the low sec is crap and need revitalize"
6/18/2012,"that's a great trip down memory lane however, not the intended point of my post we are talking about low-sec in its current form: with a focus on 00, with fw and with the new wardec changes why would a casual pvp-er go through the headache of living in low-sec now? it has so many restrictions that can be circumvented through just joining fw, or going in npc 00, or just living in high-sec and wardeccing that way i don't really need to worry too much about the clear draw-backs of low-sec that have been pointed out in the link i provided in the post aboveit's not looking to make low-sec 'easier' well, perhaps easier to live in and base out of but in all reality it would make low-sec so much more accessible to a great number of players with a good player-base in place - i believe that a proposal such as what you are suggesting may bring some benefit until then, it is really an exercise in futilityi am not really disputing any aspect of your proposal - it may indeed have some merit - i just think that we are in a 'chicken-or-the-egg' scenario"
6/18/2012,"you cant, the current design of the overview does not allow this."
6/18/2012,eve carriers have a form of point defence as well.we call them 'smartbombs'.
6/18/2012,true but they become uneffective when everything from frigate on up can orbit you ouside the range of your smartbombing.
6/18/2012,"*ineffective.such a well thought-out proposal... worthy of the assembly hall for sure. [not quite sure whether that's sarcasm by the way]anywho, you can either have a) a carrier with fighters/drones or b) a carrier with guns. the former exists already in form of the current carriers and the latter is called a dreadnaught.mixture of the two would either be op or would wreck the role of the current two classes of ship that are in the game (or probably both). if you cared to expand on what exact role this ship would fill and why this role is necessary; and also, what you envisage would be a balanced layout of slots/hardpoints/bonuses for this new 'pocket carrier', then your proposal would be worthy of debate.something tells me however, when you really think about it... besides ""it's cool and it's like battlestar galactica"" there is really no particular reason for your ship to exist in a game like eve."
6/18/2012,"conspiracy theories aside, i would say that jade constantine's proposal in the 1.1 war dec amendment seems most ""fair"" given the direction of the war declarations in general:this way if the defending alliance/corp is smaller, they can get allies for free until their numbers match that of the attacker. this would fix large alliances griefing smaller ones at will and without recourse and it would also address dogpiling of allies for the defender once they have matched the size of the attacking alliance."
6/18/2012,"exactly. ^^i don't buy the ""limiting allies helps mercs by forcing defenders to choose your allies well arguement. if you allow it to be a numbers vs equal numbers mechanic, then you have to be smart with your ally choices because adding an ally means you attacker can too. so if you add a lazy one who has 100 members but does nothing vs 20members bit logs on actively, you are going to come out on top. this mechanic ensures that lean mean mercs get jobs and dog piling of a lot of unskilled allies is just going to feed the veteran mercs more fresh meat."
6/18/2012,"+supporti also think this would allow plenty of room for mercs, as the majority of wars have sensible numbers, with corporations roughly the same size (or only a difference of a few dozen to a hundred or so), so you'd be far more limited with allies and w"
6/18/2012,"i'd like to elaborate a little bit. here's an example of a ""corp op"" that i imagined.to: corpsubject: mining op tuesday, june 19th, 6:00pm pst (02:00 gmt) - 8:00pm pst (04:00 gmt).as you all know, we are based out of stacmon (placid), formup will be at 6:00pm at stacmon viii - moon 22 - freedom extension warehouse. if you need an ore frig, the corp will lend/give you one. if you want to keep it at the end, we can take it out of your cut.we will then be moving as a group next door to our pos at dastryns viii - moon 11 (corporate bookmarked).we'll meet up with our rorqual who will be bridging us to 6r-pwu ("
6/18/2012,"on the pvp side.oh look, it's showing a cyno lit up in 6r-pwu, lets go check it out guys!and they may even catch a rorqual out in the belt."
6/18/2012,subject says it all.i propose that the war dec fees are based on the difference in size of the fighting entities. this means that a small corp deccing a large alliance to grief them or a large alliance deccing a small one to grief them would be expensive. groups of the same size would result in smaller fees.i would also add that if allies join the fight the difference that makes to the fees should be refunded to the attacker.thanks youbofflescheck out my latest chronicle in eon #28 - the soulless pilgrim
6/18/2012,"for a few seconds, i actually hoped you meant actual changes to the hull, like extra solar-panels for minmatar ships or extra hrusters, which i can see would be cool and lag-inducing. but just custom textures, nah. not that fascinating. i'm pretty fine with the current ones."
6/18/2012,"i understand you, but aside from myself, there are those that would like to custom texture. especially for corporation ""loyalty""."

6/19/2012,"having any player own a system in lowsec is a bit off, seeing that it free for any to access and technicaly is owned by the corresponding empire so no recognized overlords, you can be the leader of a corp/alliacne that dominates a system and squeezes people, but that is based on you projecting powerthough, the ideas of having more stuff to draw people to lowsec in content and rewards sounds good something different the idea of a isk generating pleasure hub i think is bad, some kind of resource would be better, maybe a mini mission terminal, or trade hub, who knows? refine drugsa stronger criminal theme would be good, and creates a contrast from empire, but have it be the empires themselves still in control in having the areas under domain just the totally not secure rampant with thieves and corruption partand likewise npc nullsec be expanded like lowsec, though in place of lack of security and corruption, totally in control by a evil empire or criminal groupalso, any thing sold in lowsec (blackmarket) should be accessible to nullsec as well, the perk of lowsec being proximity to empire spacefor a interesting isk sink, be allowed to payoff any guards in a system to not shoot you (higher, the higher the sec) and have relatively strong empire faction police that infrequently patrol between gates and stations"

6/19/2012,"yes, ribo, this quote/question. this is the one that none of us can understand what it means. repeating it countless times isn't going to make it any clearer to us. (and now *i* am repeating myself and what gunslinger42 said already. !!!! ) note, when i say 'we don't know what it means' i mean that we do not understand your english sorry if english isn't your native language, but you may have heard of something called google translate. perhaps you should try running this sentence through that to see if it comes up with anything more intelligible.""tell you why disturb afk flag an afk player..."" ??? -- this is not a sentence, nor a question. assuming you mean why it should disturb an afk player if they are afk and they get this flag, then the reason has already been answered countless times. it doesn't disturb them, but it does give out more information that the public deserves, gunslinger said this already. in fact ( and here i go repeating myself again) i would love this flag as i would cloak by your miners, wait until i get afk flagged, then once you relax thinking that i was afk, i would hot drop you and blow you up. then, after you got used to that behaviour, i would sometimes just get the afk flag, and press a button, just to scare you and make you warp off.the point is that it is pointless. tracking when people are in front of their computer... that's just not a sensible solution. (i suppose you think that afk-ing while on autopilot doing 30+ jumps in a freighter should be afk flagged to?**)**ps the answer is 'no'."
6/19/2012,"if you really want an explanation and a solution (which is doubtful), here it is again:first, what i am not talking about<U+FFFD> let<U+FFFD>s use your good rhetorical question. why disturb a cloaked pilot? you are right that, usually, there is no need to disturb cloaked pilots because they at their keyboards having fun playing eve, and that<U+FFFD>s wonderful! as you know, that<U+FFFD>s not what these many people are asking to be changed/fixed. because afk cloaked ships are not a problem when in empire, when in their own alliance space in null, or when they are being used by an active player (i.e. <U+FFFD> by someone sitting at their computer pushing buttons or taking intel notes). we<U+FFFD>re talking, instead, about the extended afk.why disturb the pilot who cloaks his ships and goes afk? we all know cloaked ships are an excellent tactic when used by an <U+FFFD>awake<U+FFFD> enemy pilot. however, when the cloaked pilot is not at the keys for an extended period of time (which i will define as 2-4+ hours), the cloaked ship/pilot are never serving a tactical purpose for <U+FFFD>gathering intel<U+FFFD> or whatever fabricated excuse was offered by the earlier poasters who follow these practices. once the afk lasts for an extended period, their sole or primary purpose becomes causing grief and interfering with normal game play by the other people in system (both blues and hostiles who are trying to get an accurate count of the tactical situation). as noted, this does violate eula and many believe it to be a broken mechanic due to lack of an effective <U+FFFD>counter measure<U+FFFD> being available to the system sovereignty holder (blues).how does the afk ship violate eula when cloaked in hostile territory? it is the exact same principle as eula forbidding the mining bots or the ratting bots, except the cloaky doesn<U+FFFD>t even require a <U+FFFD>bot<U+FFFD>. a eula violation results from (1) a pilot who is not at his computer, (2) who leaves his ship (neut or red) in enemy system, (3) for sole purpose of causing grief and annoyance and/or to impede normal game play by his enemy. [for example, a player puts his cloaked alt character into his enemy<U+FFFD>s system right before he leaves for work in the morning and the player leaves his computer running all day with the alt char online all day until the next down time without attending his keyboard except when he gets home for about 10 minutes to push a button before he leaves again to go out to the local pub for drinks and a party. (the net result of <U+FFFD>tactical intel<U+FFFD> being advocated by many people in this thread results in eighteen hours (18 hours) of cloaked enemy (red or neut) in his enemy<U+FFFD>s sovereign system or office system vs. ten minute (10 minutes) with the player at his keyboard <U+FFFD> not exactly what i would call <U+FFFD>intel gathering<U+FFFD>, but obviously trying to deliver grief.)]i particularly enjoyed the earlier question: isn<U+FFFD>t this the same as turning on a freighter to auto pilot 30 jumps across empire?<U+FFFD> guess what<U+FFFD> that freighter is <U+FFFD>at risk<U+FFFD> of being ambushed and is <U+FFFD>in play<U+FFFD> while the afk cloaker is never <U+FFFD>at risk<U+FFFD> while cloaked. summary: why disturb the cloaked pilot?1. he is interfering with normal game play while not <U+FFFD>at risk<U+FFFD>;2. he is violating eula.proposed solution: confidentially tag the offending player for his eula violation. let the gm or automation kick the afk cloaker, resulting in emergency warp. is he ""afraid"" to log back in due to ""risk""? doubtful, since he can immediately cloak up, again. anyways, this solution is simple- just use the same mechanic already in effect for eula violations when a player posts kiddie porn or uses offensive language in local. both types of conduct are reportable as a eula violation. perhaps this will take time for gm to police, but perhaps it takes less time than programming a simple timer to fix this game mechanic. as noted above, ccp does have ways to track when the account is online and inactive, which can be used by the gm to quickly identify and silently boot/bounce the afk player<U+FFFD>s account so he has to relog<U+FFFD> heaven only knows this game causes enough unintentional <U+FFFD>emergency warps<U+FFFD> that a few like this to encourage fairness shouldn<U+FFFD>t be a problem. whenever the coding is rewritten, a more permanent solution should become available, so this is only a stop gap solution."
6/19/2012,"you can't. at least not a pure fleet/friends only overview, same as wartargets only overview. it's not possible the way it is now. the way around this is to set personal/corp standings towards alliance members."
6/19/2012,"stations should have gate turrets near them at the very least. but you shouldn't really be fighting near stations anyways... fighting should be done in the field, not at the base!"
6/19/2012,"i don't see a issue with raising the time limit for aggression and being able to redock (have it tie in with the new criminal flag system). but punishing others with being agressed by others is not kosher. fixing station games should not come at the expense of other players who use stations.as others stated, generally if looking for fights get people outside of stations. if you encounter phags in docking range and they don't want to do risky pvp other than station games they could always stay dock, and you would be just as out of luck."
6/19/2012,just allow them to use covert cynos without having a cloak. no need for a new mod. jump them out to null with a transport ship and do some ninja mining. they'll be nimble enough to get out reasonably quickly.
6/19/2012,"the rorqual already has a jump drive, 1m m3 smb, and a cloning vat... who needs to jump all those frigs individually?1) have everybody install blank jump clones (no implants) on the rorqual.2) rorqual jumps out to the destination system3) everybody clone jumps to the rorqual4) everybody gets in the ore ship of their flavour from the smb (frig, barge, exhumer) and gets to mining.5) when op is done, everybody sticks their ships back in the smb and self-destructs pod (no implants, no money lost, safely back in hisec system of their preference).6) rorqual jumps back out.only downside to this is you have to wait 24h from initial jump to get back in your implanted clone, though this could easily be fixed by allowing you to chose a non-medical clone as you default clone when you get podded, or by increasing the number of times per day you can jump clone."
6/19/2012,"in before goon whining,i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
6/19/2012,why is it so expensive for small corps to war dec big corps? surely a small corp should get to dec corps on the cheap. ccp have gone the wrong way round doing the opposite which just encourages corps to fill up with alt chars on unsub'd accounts. really dumb.war cost should = number of chars in your corp not number in target. this would also encourage corps to throw out in active players.

6/20/2012,"i don't know where people are getting the idea that this kind of warp effect would be instantaneous.if the warp mechanics were switched to this system, ships would still have to align, and ships would still have to obey the laws of physics. they will not instantly appear on their destination. ships are not quantum particles. they don't randomly materialize out of thin air.with the current warp mechanics, ships only reach their maximum warp speed halfway to their destination. in other words, 1/3 of the time your ship is accelerating to max warp speed, 1/3 of the time your ship is in max warp speed, and another 1/3 your ship is in deceleration.this new system would do away with warp tunnel accelerations and decelerations. but ships which warp will not magically appear at their destination instantaneously.edithere's a picture"

6/20/2012,"to 0lona, i think that spies also do want to see what other spies are in their system so that they can determine their where abouts. removing local even optionally breaks this and makes cloakers even more powerful. ( collecting intel and collecting it completely stealthily!) little do people realize this is actually more power to cloakers. (miners rarely understand this as their view is myopically from a prey point of view )to the idea of ""extended afk"" by kahn soomer, firstly kudos for putting together a cohesive arguement that is fair and unbiased. but while i agree on your premise and definitions, i cannot agree that even an extended afker is doing anything wrong. what if i wanted to record via videocam 24 hours worth of footage of an enemy pos while cloaked? that's legitamate intel gathering. that's fair play according to eula. that's how i know where your fleet is or where your miners hang out and what times they log on. why should i have to press a button to prove non-afk in this case??being afk is not against eula. end of story. you should really think about your grounds of why you think it should be. no other arguement against afkers without tackling this fundamental issue is worth considering."

[put it into the same place where you report foul mouthed people or pron links = grief against the local residents in local. the policy would be explained in a small pop up or description before you push the button.] 2. ccp follows up on a report of the violation in a leisurely way (as time permits) to boot the long afk cloaky causing him to go offline and into a safe emergency warp (until he logs back in and reactives cloak). abuse of the reporting tool could also carry consequences. problem solved (at least until some ""pvp counter-measure"" or some better solution is developed and implemented.)we players are paying for good mechanics. please don't tell us ccp still doesn't have time to fix this or address it. please make this a priority, and please someone on the council take on this project as a crusade. show us you can make a difference. this will limprove the game."
6/20/2012,"with the new fw changes, prices for lp store items have dropped massively. (as was to be expected with a 50% discount on the minmatar front.)while this on its own is fantastic, i fear it has impacted level 5 missions in a very bad way.with the dropped prices, running a level 5 missions now gets you about 20m including everything, for which you have to risk a carrier, while a faction warfare mission nets you way more for only risking a bomber.a simple fix to this would be to have two different lp stores; one for faction warfare, one for normal missions.that way normal missions get their normal risk vs. reward ratio back, which i feel was fine before the patch. (50m or so per mission for risking your capital)so to all my fellow bears out there: please help me poke ccp about this!"

6/21/2012,"skip my wall of text. read the solution (see above). pick it up. run with it, mr. council man.further constructive suggestion:if you don't want to have a gm click 2 buttons (this isn't drafting response to a petition, is it?), then automate the button to activate the booting 2 hours after the report but only if the afk cloaker remains inactive in the same system where he was first reported as an extended afk cloaker (2+ hours afk) to ccp. this would cause auto boot 4+ hours into his afk mode.you think the risk to cloaky is unfari? an afk cloaky has risk of getting discovered in an automated emergency d/c warp out? well, that probably depends on where he parked himself afk, but i'd say the risk is minimal. oh, wai... do you want a role with no risk, mr. cloaky? are you afraid, mr. cloaky? lol. even the psychological warfare could have a counter. i love it. p.s. - making a constructive suggestion in here seems to always cause trolling and personal attack. so, you win, mr. troll. i'm not renting and i'm not going ""back to empire"". instead, i'll simply say:i have played eve continuously for over 6 years, and in all parts of the map. one thing remains constant. wherever players gather together near a resource, you have people doing extended cloaky afk looking for ganks. since there is no counter for this with game mechanics, the best solution is simply not to undock or to move to another system. moving is easy for the large alliances who control the council. it's not so easy for the small guys. [atm, my main is associated with a larger alliance. so this isn't really hurting me personally, atm. i'm posting because i think the mechanic is broken, and has been broken for many years due to the way the cloak mechanism was coded.] if a council member takes up this cause to investigate a solution with ccp, he will have my utmost respect and appreciation."
6/21/2012,"capacitor consume for cloaked ships is much better solution than posting gms. they dont have time for check every cloakers and you never see cloaked pilot active or not. so, how you can report a cloakers if you dont know he is active or not?capacitor consume much better solution.during cloak disable cap regeneration and after every hour remove 25% (or 20%) of capacitor from covert cloaked ships and 50% of capacitor every hour from non covert cloaked ship. thats mean a cloaker need to move after 4-5 hours (recons) or need to move after 2 hours (common cloaks)disable recloak ability again until the cloak can reach the appropriate value at least 25% or 50% of cap. (depends from cloak type, covert or not)so, when the ship run out from capacitor, the ship need to move to safe spot and the pilot unable to remain afk 4 or 5 hours long time in enemy system or he risk his ship."

6/21/2012,"thank you kind sir,well, i thought about this deeply for the past few days.(tl;dr: read the underlined)here's how i feel about this...a few things came to mind while talking about this over a few beers with friends:it would be ridiculously cool to have all ore ships able to do this. but...1).no older char would want to use the frigs then.i figure that you should sacrifice something to have this kind of mobility. else all the older players would do it in a ship that could mine more. this would be a role for the ship. a way of use, much like a mack is currently for cutting ice. this would be a newbie mining ship and a ship that they will want to still get in after a year+ if they enjoy the play-style.also, it won't be like now where you sell the previous ship when you acquire a new one. each one will have a unique function.2) this may sound strange or lazy of me, but my second reason is that there may be a way to abuse it. right now, ccp is designing the ore frig. if they want to give it this ability then they can insure it does not get abused (or later enforce/patch, because eve players are quite crafty). it could be used to transport cargo, fit some guns and hot drop, ninja pi'ing, and god knows what else. (we tried to brainstorm considerably, and the more beer, the crazier the ideas. none however were all that game-breaking in our opinion) right now ccp can design it as a ship role rather then a patch in later.3) it should not use a black-ops ship to jump it. covert cyno's would make it too op in my humble opinion. a cyno at least is visible in local, lights up in the map if you're looking for it, and the ship lighting it is giving everyone an invite to warp to them."
6/21/2012,"i know its not really a big thing or really a issue but i find that it gets old to click to see the mission details over and over to remember what system the mission is in. i would like to be able to see where the mission is when i click on my journal and am on the missions tab. an old timer like me tends to forget things from time to time and when i have several missions up and ready, i would like to know if i have more then one in the same area just by looking at my lists of missions and not having to click through them all. but like i said, its now a real big deal, just somethin i'd like to see."
6/21/2012,"i was just thinking of something the npc corps could use to make the game easier for new people to learn and something that could interact with existing or a new tutorial. i remember the csm and ccp were both interested in this area so i decided to post it here.many professional corps have a fleet doctrine that tells people you need to be able to fly ship x with y fittings. well, the starter corps don't really have anything like that. some players are smart enough to use the corp chat channel, which is a good resource for feedback, but others never visit it. so i was thinking, on the fitting screen, why not add some basic ship templates that the npc corps, where the tools and resources of a player corp aren't available, could have? the new players are losing out without this and it means every corp they go into has to train them on elementary fitting philosophy. in fact it doesn't even need to be limited to npc corps either just to be safe.so why not create some decent sample fits for some ships (maybe a pvp and pve version for each) using basic t1 items and base it on minimal skills and fitting req. the csm could help ccp come up with those fits or put them up to public for suggestions and feedback. make it available to everyone under a basic fits tab and as you are skilled up for more ship types, more fittings are unlocked for you. ie no cruisers are shown until you get cruiser 1 and when you do, that race's fits are unlocked in the module. then you allow players to browse the modules and be able to mouse over the fittings. this is a key point, each item fitted will have a little tool-tip telling players exactly why it is there. the hulkageddon hulk fit will feature a lot of tank and the tool tip will tell players that they are using tank in these slots so the ship will have a better chance of surviving until concord shows up or something like that. maybe even add a few suggested skills like drone five for the lovely vexors. then all you need to do is add a tutorial telling players about said feature. so when they get a dessy from the tut missions a destroyer fitting tutorial will come up and it will show the player a pve fit, a pvp fit, and a salvage fit perhaps for the cats.these wouldn't necessarily be current meta fits, but basic common sense fits that can help establish some sort of baseline to put newer players on the right track right away. for example, a new player wouldn't know not to mix tank. so none of the fits would have mixed tank and would specifically mention that mixing tank is bad. that way the new player can just plug and play until he's ready to improve his fitting skills as a player."

6/22/2012,nice dune reference. but i'm going to go ahead and stick with envoys.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
6/22/2012,"still not a bad idea, if handled properly.i still would go with point defense (such as phalanx ciws-type modules).i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
6/22/2012,this is exactly what i'm talking about.
6/22/2012,"i support the revision of warp mechanics.one thing that must be remembered from an acceleration point of view is that eve physics operates in what appears to be a dynamically fluid model, meaning that when you stop the ships sublight engines momentum is not conserved, and the ship comes to a stop. in real space there is nothing to slow down a craft and once top speed is obtained engines can be shut down without a change in velocity.this means that theoretically, and purely theoretically, when the ship engages warp speed it must accelerate through space and maintain velocity. coming out of warp does not require any sort of retrorocket burn, but only that the warp engine be disengaged. from a theoretical standpoint this means that hitting warp should not and can not be instantaneous, as in the diagram.as far as other mechanics are concerned, it could be proposed that your camera drones do not automatically follow you into warp but instead lag behind for a second or two. this would give you the effect of watching your ship warp out, with the camera drones catching up after the initial boost. a similar reverse mechanic would allow your drones to drop out of warp a second or two after your ship did, meaning they would arrive first and watch as your ship dropped out of warp.~ omen"

6/22/2012,supported. who would have thought there would be such support for trading frozen corpses on the market?~ omen
6/22/2012,"oh noes. yet another cap consume cloaking suggestion. how original. how about you stop trying to nerf my play style of intel collection (recording the screen forever) and all the other comments that other people have mentioned like relative safety of cloakers in station of log off. your whining ( of just the 2 of you and your alts ) is what everyone deals with in nullsec. you got a bum deal, you rented a fringe system from a big alliance. surprise surprise. these alliances treat these systems like ghetto properties by the train tracks. ie get whatever sucker to pay to rent it as they can't be bothered to defend it themselves. i used to argue for a counter to cloakers too (google it) before i realized the legitimacy of intel collection and nullsec noob terrorizing. which is valid tactics in null. ( yes. valid. just like ninja salvaging )so just htfu. (i hate using that term, but nothing else sums it up as well)"
6/22/2012,reading comprehension fail. i'll say it again. risk == reward. there is no isk making in intel collection or cloaking. having no risk is fine. and fair. you miner on the other hand are making isk mining. you and only you need to bear the risk.
6/22/2012,"arguemont just htfu and gtfo, no matter how you cry with your alts.this is a counter for cloakers. already they not have counters. and afk cloakers plagued all systems. they are realy collecting intels alone in empty systems 24/7 time long?? lolcloakers is just little girls, they just want to play without risk. bunch of pcapacitor consume for cloaked ships is much better solution than posting gms. they dont have time for check every cloakers and you never see cloaked pilot active or not. so, how you can report a cloakers if you dont know he is active or not?capacitor consume much better solution.during cloak disable cap regeneration and after every hour remove 25% (or 20%) of capacitor from covert cloaked ships and 50% of capacitor every hour from non covert cloaked ship. thats mean a cloaker need to move after 4-5 hours (recons) or need to move after 2 hours (common cloaks)disable recloak ability again until the cloak can reach the appropriate value at least 25% or 50% of cap. (depends from cloak type, covert or not)so, when the ship run out from capacitor, the ship need to move to safe spot and the pilot unable to remain afk 4 or 5 hours long time in enemy system or he risk his ship."
6/22/2012,"why is it that when i argue a point, i just get called a troll? those were all legitimate arguement. if you dont like the fact your proposal is full of holes, then amend it. dont just call me a troll. as for the cap consumtion for cloakies. although the way rib suggests it works is very differant to how any other mods work at the moment (im usually moderately against ideas like this), i actually see very few problems with it. in fact i can't think of anything legitimately wrong with it. makes sence.oh, and rib, nice to see you finally abandoned the log off mechanic and afk tag ideas. = pif it did take 4 or so hours for your cap to run out using a system like this it doesn't break anyone's gameplay. if you want to gather intel then set an alarm, come back and bouncy around safe spots for a bit whilest your cloak recharges. you probably wouldn't even need to bounce, just check dscan for combat scanners whilst you wait.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
6/22/2012,i agree with you on that.
6/22/2012,"if it wouldn't be developmentally expensive, i see no reason for this not to be done."
6/22/2012,sounds reasonable.
6/22/2012,"i support this. if they take the initiative to defend their corp/alliance pos by parking their ship and taking control of the guns, i agree they deserve credit if they kill anything.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
6/22/2012,this seems a complete no brainer to me. pos gunners are real players defending their property like anyone else. ccp need to sort this out asap and congrats on a successful defence!
6/22/2012,"the real question is, why haven't i ever seen this brought up before?"
6/22/2012,the voice of high sec is the sound of a carebear emo-raging after being suicide ganked.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
6/22/2012,"not sure what the right answer to all this is ... but the truth is, eve will stagnate and/or eventually die unless ccp solves the problem of having created game mechanics where ""your best option as a newer player being wardecced/ganked/etc. in hisec is to simply log out for a week, month, forever"".no game designer should be stupid enough to actually encourage their players to log off."
6/22/2012,"both sides of this argument have legitimate points, but we need to look at the subject realistically. i think everyone would agree that pos's need quite a bit of revision, not just in this area. i think there needs to be a clear area of distinction between what can be done with an abandoned pos and what can be done with a bashed pos. changing a game mechanic to the former would allow for trash removal, while changing the latter could drastically change galactic warfare. to hack a pos would mean suddenly that pos's would become much more vulnerable. imagine, if you will, the ramifications of such a mechanic on alliance wars. if taking over/down a pos was as simple as spending a few hours hacking it or running a salvager over it, we would see an influx of active pos's that would be under attack.finding a clear distinction between what would be defined as an ""abandoned"" pos and a bashed pos could be problematic. its unclear how one would avoid completely circular reasoning.** can a bashed pos be hacked? **** how many days must a pos remain unattended to be considered ""abandoned?"" **** if a bashed pos has been sitting for ""x"" hours/days can it be hacked? **** should a bashed pos ever be considered abandoned?**these are important questions that should not be taken lightly, and i would not expect ccp to take lightly. if any change occurs, it should be minor and minuscule, that allows pos's to be removed if certain time and attention conditions are met. otherwise warfare in general could be at risk with such changes.~ omen"
6/22/2012,"as it stands, a cargo ship that devotes every low slot and rig hardpoint to a cargo expander can carry a lot more than a ship that lends even just a few slots to other modules or rigs. i think adding a stacking penalty would put much more control over a ships cargohold by making its max cargohold size fairly proportional to the base cargohold size. ships meant for carrying cargo could have their base cargohold adjusted so that their maximum cargohold size is still the same, but they could afford to spend at least a few modules on a very basic tank, or anything else they may deem necessary. it would put more strategy into fitting a cargo ship, and would even out the differences between the races' industrials. currently, the badgers have relatively small max cargoholds in comparison to their size/skill requirements because they have so many mid slots, forcing them to tank and not be capable of hauling a large load. inversely, amarr industrials have relatively large max cargoholds in comparison to size/skill requirements because they have so many low slots."

6/22/2012,"balance battlebadger pvp, obviously."

6/22/2012,"sounds good to me.i know a lot of people were pissed off about the item renaming.also meta level is really only important for levels 1-4. i'd move the little blue triangle to the upper left and not have it appear on t2 or faction modules.oh yeah and the visual styling of the other triangles use dots and symbols, not numbers. so 4 dots would work for meta 1-4.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
6/22/2012,"i'm looking for feedback on the idea of an industrial-only jump portal generator. the unit could theoretically be fit on a rorqual, for example and would allow smaller industrials and maybe a few wingmen more movement in nullsec. conceivably, freighters would be too large, but orcas, hulks, itty's could be fair game. this would allow greater range in nullsec, along with the danger of losing or stranding a fleet of hulks in hostile territory, if your fc happens to be an idiot. and honestly, who doesnt like the idea of that.thoughts..~ omen"
6/22/2012,"this post should be in features and ideas... not in the assembly hall... as for your idea.... i don't see any glaring problems with it, although i probably wouldn't support it. in my opinion, cyno's, jump bridges, and jump portals really reduce the size of eve online. they increase force projection to the point where multi-front battles no longer matter. while you aren't necessarily transporting war supplies, i think this is just another power projection mechanic that i don't see as benefiting the game... i think there should be risk in moving goods in and out of nullsec, and i fear this is just another mechanic that severely mitigates nullsec logistics risks!"
6/22/2012,"not sure i like the idea of a mining fleet having a cyno alt on standby in a secondary system able to give them an easy out when a gang shows up.""captain! potential danger!""""light the cyno.""*poof* the mining fleet flitters away to safety."
6/22/2012,"if it needs to be moved, thats fine. i agree there should be risk transporting in and out of null, and this idea would not remove that risk, only reduce it to a certain extent. remember that until we can light cynos in highsec, which will never happen, this will only allow for movement from within nullsec to nullsec/lowsec.your argument is interesting in that by decrying an industrial jump portal, you would also seemingly disapprove of the titan's jump portal. my argument is significantly less drastic than that of the titans jump portal, which already exists ingame and allows large military fleets to be moved at will. furthermore, and this is key, the idea would add more industrials to null, which i believe would add more content to the game.miners and industrialists arent exactly adventurous in nullsec right now. not only is the ore barely/not worth it, if anyone shows up in local, you can count on the miner eating it. it would seem that if we can get more miners into null, we would add more targets, which equals more fights."
6/22/2012,"i do think titan's jp is op, and could use some ""tweaking"" to balance it... the titan is also a skill intensive, 60b isk ship.... whereas a rorqual is far more accessible. as for moving industrialists to null.... i would cherish the thought... however i don't think this is the real trick needed. to bring nullsec indy, you really need to:1.) make logistics to/from the jita teat a little bit less reliable...2.) invert the indy bonuses between nullsec and highsec: in other words, you should only find perfect refine in nullsec, and never in highsec. r&d and manufacturing slots and times should also be much more abundant, efficient, and cheaper in nullsec rather than in highsec... this is the gist of what your proposal does: it makes a highsec corp more able to run excursions into lowsec/nullsec to run mining ops by significantly mitigating the logistics risks between the two areas. i think this is the wrong attitude.... improvements to nullsec industry should focus on operating in nullsec, not bringing them in safely for a brief excursion."
6/22/2012,"that does kind of involve keeping your rorqual in the belt/grav site, which is just asking to lose it..."
6/22/2012,agreed. how many rocks do you need to mine to offset the cost of a rorqual? i punch those numbers into my calculator and it makes a happy face.
6/22/2012,"+1am truly annoyed that there isn't an easy way right click > ""navigate to x mission location in x system""."
6/22/2012,i actually think you we should have right click options when clicking on the journal entry. some possible options should include: speak to the agent. complete missionset destination to agentset destination to missionwhat else would be good?
6/22/2012,"no, the only factor on the price of war should be the amount of members your corp or allince has. if your corp is packed with members you should be able to afford the cost. so small gang and one amn corps should get to dec for cheap."
6/22/2012,"i contacted the csm, and was evemailed by alekseyev karrde, who let me know that ccp are aware of the idea and that we should look out for -not exactly sure what the new player experience has to do with it, although i supose they would benefit more than most from a change like this."
6/22/2012,"at least they are looking at this idea, its going to be interousting what they do if they are incorperating it into i can see this truly going a lot further then just new player experience imo. cause it could not just be corp/alliance recruitment but advertisement for services as will."

6/23/2012,i think this proposal takes away the only thing that favors the side with fewer systems. this proposal makes it so that the defending side will have a reduced incentive to defend plexes in pvp. the economic attitude will be let the enemy finsih cappign some plexes in our systems. after all the more they contest the system the more money we make by running defensive plexes later when they are not around. right no with no reward for defensive plexing the defenders have a considerable incentive to drive a plexer out before he captures the plex. that is drive him out in pvp. because if he lets the attacker actually capture the plex they are in effect punished by having to orbit a button for no gain or keep getting steps closer to losing the system.the no lp for defensive plexing is one of the better mechanics in this expansion. leave it be.make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
6/23/2012,"no lp for defensive plexing does several good things:1) encourages the defending side to stop plexers in pvp before they capture a plex so that they do not need to orbit a button for no pay.2) gives some reason to join the side with fewer systems since although your lp is worth very little you have more opportunities to make lp through plexing. it also limits the winning sides ability to make lp through plexing. yes they can still make lp from missions but that does not help their occupancy efforts and if enough people switch over to missioning instead of plexing then the side with fewer systems is given some respite.3) it can lead to a war where many systems become vulnerable or close to vulnerable and then flipped in a dramatic fashion. sure this hasn't happened, yet. but we are starting to see it signs of how it will work. one of the caldari or gallente refused to flip a system after bringing it to vulnerable. the minmatar are already getting concerned of the prospect that amarr will start farming those back systems in a way that will be very difficult/tedious for them to recapture. once the amarr gets around to plexing those back systems and forcing the minmatar to plex for no gain we will start to wear them out. we haven't really begun that yet but it will work if we do decide to do that. 4) its sort of neat to use individual greed as a balance. 5) if you want to farm systems where your enemy can't even dock then eve offers that already. sov null sec. i think sov null sec could greatly benefit from a system like this where you are rewarded for taking over new space instead of just sitting in your space and farming it. imo, that is a big reason why null sec has been so boring for the last few years. by forcing people to take over new space in order to gain isk you encourage conflict. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
6/23/2012,"everytime you mention this point, i will repeat myself, so that any new people joining the thread (as if there were any) will know the fundamental point you are missing here.no isk, no risk. cloakers earn no isk, cloakers do not earn any risk."
6/23/2012,"actually, there are some considerations that this proposal misses here:do you mean to make your cap -100% recharge while you are cloaked? how else is a 25%cap/1 hour cycle time going to ever deplete more than 25% of cap??? so if by a small chance that rib actually thought of that, and just failed to mention the -100% recharge necessity, then i would point out that this -100% cap gimp completely kills cover ops/recon ships which have small cap. you won't be able to make it more 2 jumps into null sec before you have to decloak to recharge your cap so that you can even make the next warp.not to mention it completely destroys the gameplay of scouts jumping into an unknown system without system safes. they jump in, they cloak and warp to sun, and already need to decloak to recharge cap. the see combat probes show up on dscan, they recloak and bounce to the next celestial, now they are definitely out of cap, probably drop out of warp half way. now they have only 2 choices. decloak and hope to gain enough cap for another warp, or stay cloaked and hide..... (yeah, you saw this coming) 1 hour later when the awesome new 25% / h mechanic decloaks them. pretty much jumping into enemy territory with even a minor pvp force will be suicide.this will totally ruin the gameplay of covert ops."
6/23/2012,"now, here is the real reason why miners are the ones who need to htfu. yes, logical statements strung together in a convincing argument.i will answer them in faq style:statement: no isk, no risk. (that is the defence of afk cloakers. miners seem to not want to recognize this)but, they strangely don't have a problem with accepting the flipside of that same statement:with isk comes risk.they are the first to admit that there should be risk in the game, and that risk should be scaled to the amount of isk the activity you are doing earns.q. is highsec mining more or less profitable than nullsec mining?a. it is less much less profitable.q. is highsec mining more or less risky than nullsec mining?a. it is less risky, but only because of cloakers and chances of hotdrops in nullsec.q. should i as a nullsec miner have to tolerate the possibility of getting hotdropped at any time?a. yes. you made that choice when you decided to mine in nullsec. you are making a lot more isk than in highsec, and therefore this is your risk to wear.q. but i paid an alliance to rent this space! shouldn't this entitle me to some level of peace and quiet to mine?a. no. you should have factored that renting cost into your mining yield profit calculations. you paid for the right to use null space without actually putting the time into conquering it yourself. you did not pay for risk free ore mining. if mining rare expensive ore was so easy, why doesn't everyone who can pay a rent fee do it?q. i thought it moving to null is what everyone does to get rich fast! it isn't?a. not necessarily. maybe a myth propagated by renting alliances or pvpers looking for fresh meatq. i thought the formula to use was "" if possible nullsec yield/month - rent/month > highsec yield/month "" then you should move to null, is this not true?a. not that simple. you forgot to factor in the risk profiles of null vs highsec.q. i'm pissed now because i didn't do the math, and i think its unfair that i thought that this mining in null thing was going to get me rich fast. but it really doesn't unless i have to change the way i mine, hire scouts and do all this other stuff that i didn't need to do when i mined in highsec. i want to blame this on someone. isn't it unfair that afk cloakers have such a 'godlike' uber mechanic on their side?a. no. it is not their fault that the way the game is played and balanced in nullsec does not work to your expectations. they earn no isk. they get no risk. denial of space, and reconnaissance is their role in nullsec. it is their job in the circle of life to make your life a pain. and the pain is yours to bear as you want to mine rare ore and get rich."

6/23/2012,"jedi, except for teshania and dinger, i dont believe that this thread said very much about online towers at all, and was dealing with fairly strictly offline towers. and while i was really the only ones to respond to their posts, they havent posted back on it.im not even sure what you mean by ""bashed"" is this a tower in reinforced? is this a tower that is past reinforced but not restronted (shields below 25%)? what tower state are you trying to represent here? out of fuel - a tower has gone offline (because of fuel) and has been out of fuel for less then ~3 days abandoned - a tower is offline but anchored for more then a week ,reinforced - a tower on a stront timerbashed -?what was being presented and discussed here was a new structure, anchorable near an existing [offline] tower. who's function was to capture or unanchor the target tower. when dealing strictly with towers offlined from lack of fuel, or intentionally offlined by the owners; abandoned can be judged simply by: closed corp, or offlined pos for more then x days, weeks or months. i tend to put that number for abandoned at a week.the questions that you raise seem to be on a different topic entirely. the op was talking about offline towers."
6/23/2012,"turreted carriers have been proposed before, and been shot down as an idea, namely because at the time dreadnoughts had drone bays. now that they do not, adding turrets would be an interesting idea, however their utility and balancing would be an issue. an issue balancing that i am not convinced is worth attempting to fix. the parallels to real life are a bit disingenuous, as most of the other ship classes and abilities and configurations of ships are not paralleled in rl it is only the ship class names that are drawn from rl. in rl and you should wiki this, frigates and cruisers sizes and armaments get fuzzy after a while with ships classed as frigates, become the sizes of cruisers, battle-cruisers are the same sizes as other cruisers or even as small as destroyers, which can be frigate sized, or battle-cruiser sized, depending on their roles and not their tonnage.also, take a quick look at the battleships in game, all of them lack the secondary armament that real life battleships had, or the tertiary armaments.a quick check of the last of the great battleships would have something like 2x2 main canon groups, 4x2 secondary sized cannon groups, 24x1 tertiary turret weapons and 5 torpedo tubes, . (hms agamemnon) which would be a fairly big change from the current 6-8 turret distribution.using the missourri as an analogue to dreadnoughts, it has9 <U+FFFD> 16 in (410 mm)/50 cal mark 7 guns12 <U+FFFD> 5 in (130 mm)/38 cal mark 12 guns32 <U+FFFD> bgm-109 tomahawk cruise missiles16 <U+FFFD> rgm-84 harpoon anti-ship missiles4 <U+FFFD> 20 mm/76 cal phalanx ciwsas its armament, another far cry from the 3 weapons slots (or 2x2 that the nag has) the rl analogues that people try to bring up are wrong in terms of armament of ships. however roles are fairly universal. a pocket carrier of the orca size would not be an amiss addition to the game. a 5 fighter ship that cant assign them, or triage would be an interesting ship to have on grid. of course it does need a better justification the ""it should be interesting""i also do not know how it would fit into the current ships lineup in terms of abilities or utility"
6/23/2012,they can't orbit you outside the range of your support fleet. if they can they are most likely not a threat to your carrier.no to capitals ever being viable without subcap support.
6/23/2012,"and you obviously haven't participated in capital operations or you would know that fighters can't attack pos due to range issues... and that a carrier can instantly recall it's drones from across the system, pull them, and deploy more ""useful"" drones for combat (because fighters can't hit anything smaller than a cruiser)... and that carriers are far more useful on field with the other support ships, going into triage mode or providing pantheon-style remote reps with another carrier to the gang/fleet."

6/23/2012,"i do not understand why is this being proposed, but its an awful idea. 1) it makes industrialist's lives harder - being slower or smaller means more time to move things2) it makes ganking less profitable, less stuff3) it makes traders move less volume of cargohold expanders ii, one of the entry points in commodity tradingthe reality, also, is that even with your suggestion, a max tanked caldari industrial would still be alpha gankable. and if you are taking a regular indy to lowsec you are doing it wrong.no one wins, everyone loses, in exchange for higher but useless ehp on caldari cargo ships. yeah, thanks but no thanks.as an aside,i think the industrials have very little difference among them, mostly reduced to were you want to take the skill in training (ie if you want to cross train racially or go beyond indy iii) and the f/jf endgame (i personally prefer the gallente blockade runner/dst series because they just look awesome and like the align of the slowbelisk better than the charon, which often falls for the bumpies in jita)so if you dont mind crosstraining or are amarr and wont go above indy iii, bestower is your boat. if you dont mind crosstraining or are gallente and will train indy v, you go iteron road (mammoth and itty iv are not that different, and besides, the itty 3 is better than the iteron iv and mammoth in price/performance and m3/hour it can move). if you want a charon or rhea you go caldari and eat small hold on the low end (or crosstrain amarr or gallente to indy 3 as a fallback)the only race screwed over in reality is the minmatar, i really don't understand why anyone trains minmatar indy.eve forums official anthem:"

6/24/2012,"as a ""cloaky f ag"" do i think that this needs to be balanced? yes.my ability to sit in a prime enemy system from uptime to downtime risk free while inflicting economic damage is a bit tilted. am i afk and no threat? who knows. even at work i will rdp into my home box and give local a wave. i do that three to four times at work which takes about 1 minute every time i do and for four minutes of work i lock down a system. really not all that fair. until the mechanic is fixed myself and other cloaky alt will be camping systems while my freighter alt makes me all the isk i need. a solution. probes that scan down cloaked ships. have it triangulate the position of the ship based on how long since they last warped. the longer that they have not warped the easier it is to scan down. to ensure the security of actual cloaked scouts make it so that the first 10 minutes of non warp activity you cannot be detected. after that it becomes incrementally easier.this means i have to warp around at least ever 10 minutes or risk being detected. i cannot do this while at work. and i would not risk doing so when rl has to take precedence over the game."
6/24/2012,and that makes bombers and scouting worthless. well done.

6/24/2012,"i'm not sure if this is true.i think if you are in a player corporation and you are war decced by a bigger, older corporation, some would suggest that you and your corpies could stay station docked (or logged off) for a week to deny them targets. other options include moving to a new region, hiring mercenaries, or even fighting back. if you never leave the npc corporation, you are safe from being war decced, but you have to pay 11% taxes. joining a good player corporation is another option too. a good corporation will provide you with ships and training. you also have three character slots. you could make a different character for each slot, and put each one in a different corporation if you wanted to. that way, if your pvp character was at war, you could leave him or her docked up while taking your miner or missioner out for a week or so. your option. you are 'safe' while docked. you can even engage in station trading while docked. it doesn't mean you have to be logged out."
6/24/2012,"also suicide ganking generally only occurs if you have something that is worth ganking vs the tank.ie ,no random missioning ship (tech 1 bc bs) tech 2 or lower fit will be generally suicide ganked, generally its the tech 3 and or faction/officer fit deadspace ship.other ships, unless you have expensive cargo not really, and if you die with expensive cargo chances are you are not a fresh out of rookie ship noob, just stupid.relating to the topic maker, eve is a different game, and frankly if you think everything should be 100% safe and crime free, you are in the wrong game. what i see as a epidemic of stupid, the tutorial or game resources should try better to erase the stupid.1. if you are out of npc corp you could get war decked2. undocking could result in your ship being blown up3. fitting or carrying around expensive things is not always the best idea, you don't work your way to the 'best gear' for a class, no item is truly the best, it is only good in the measure of effectiveness vs cost. eve has a free loot system where anything you posses that is taken out of station can be lost stolen or blown up at any time. i hear black prophecy has a spaceship no-consequence style gameplay where items have levels of increasingly good and you sort of gear up a ship just like a class in wow. if you get the top rated gun on your ship you never have to worry about losing it, or the ship itself. i was a bit disappointing in the game with regards to this making actions in the game generally meaningless, but it might be a better fit for the wow crowd."

6/25/2012,"excuse me for interrupting the personal attacks, but i have a question.are you seriously trying to defend some ""need"" for a hostile afk cloak to remain ""in operation"" for more than twenty (20) hours to protect an afk pilot in a hostile system? shouldn't the real question be how long before we force a disconnect/emergency warp on the griefer? or, should we continue to troll and personally attack the posters bringing up these good ideas? lol. get serious. if you are really on about getting some killmails or some serious intelligence gathering, you're going to have to move about, anyways! let's send a message to the extended afk cloaker - no risk, no killmails. shouldn't we focus on why anyone needs to cloak for over 4, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22 hours afk in a hostile system, and then ask whether the needs of the one exceed the needs of the many? i think i already spotted the ""one"" in this topic ... does anyone else recognize the troll? lol how long do you think should be the extended afk??i see no reason not to disconnect the cloaky so the isk maker alts can move to another system after a reasonable period of time, rather than forcing the isk maker to choose either extreme risk or logoffski to play wow. some chars gather isk. some chars gather killmails. either one is fine. why can't we all just ""get along"". but, just the same as you don't want miners and ratters afk all the time ... you shouldn't get cloakers ""hunting"" afk all the time. keep the pilots active. i bet you'll get more killmails in the end. don't make them log off due to tactics without a counter."
6/25/2012,"where can move, when all system is plagued with cloaker alts, which is easily can create on account slots and need just few days training ?easily can put cloaker afk alts to all systems.that's why i wrote, need create to cloaking devices with capacitor or fuel useage and cloaker cant do afk cloaking easily 24/7 times long or afk tag and afk cloaker cant terrorize other active players anymore."
6/25/2012,"yes, rib. i agree with you, except for one small issue that needs some thought.if cap needs for cov ops cloaking device increases after the extended afk period, and this cap drain simply de-cloaks the ship, the poor little cloaky nan******* would be left out there at risk of being scanned out and killed. the point is that we never want cloaked ships to be ""at risk"". amirite? or wrong?so her's a small addition to rib's great idea: program the game to recognize the covert ops cloaking device malfunction (due to cap drained) and cause an emergency warp via a safe disconnection. can't ccp set conditions for extended afk/increased cap use by cov ops cloak and decloak, result in d/c to emergency warp? vivi suggested using a ""report spammer/report extended cloaker grief"" button/feature trigger causing ccp enforcement (automatic or gm) to disconnect the griefer. the d/c seemed a bit more humane as it's really hard for the average joe to catch a small cov op cloaker after d/c into the emergency warp. the d/c works for either one of these mechanics (1.- cap drain, or 2. -report extended afk grief button) includes a d/c with emergency warp out. using d/c, the cloaker preserves his current ""not at any serious risk"" advantage. the d/c balances the game by pushing the cloaker out of system for a little bit of time so local traffic can resume until the cloaker returns. cloaker still wins, but majority still have some small counter measure. the d/c happens only after the cloaker has full reign of some long and unreasonable period (4+ hours) for imposing his grief upon all the locals in that system. now tell me why this is not better? more balanced, yes?"
6/25/2012,"if you are at the machine you can manage your ship with my idea. can use cap booster, you can evade from scanners just need to warp to safepoint upload your cap for activating cloaking device and recloak. repeat, when you are active.the 4-5 hours long capacitor amount enough for prepare to everything (with covert ops). if a cloaker go afk longer time than 4-5 hours. he need to undertake the consequences and he will uncloaked and he will scannable.when you know you need to move away from your pc, you can prepare for 4-5hours long time cloaking, but you can't left your ship behind when you move to afk 23 hours long. the cloaker have choice to log off when he know he need to move to work 8 hours long time and he wont play and he can't cloaking at enemy system without risk.and another important thing cloaker sometimes need to recharge his cap boosters or fuels and they need to move to loading for their cargoholds. so, they cant sit in a system three months long time without move.your idea problem is the report to gm. they have enough job, they cant check everytimes who afk or who not.and dont forget they can't respond immediately for player requests."
6/25/2012,"this thread is so full or terrible logic and bad ideas it gives my headache a headache. in order for the cap drain idea to work, you need to stop cap recharge whilst cloaked. which sounds fine until you actually think about it. it would mean anyone with a cloak would have serious trouble using the cloak to disengage if they just spent most of their cap using an mwd to escape. it also means cloakies can't be cloaked if they want to recharge any cap (which for some pass fits, takes a very long time indeed), to the point where you might as well not have a cloak at all. use a cap booster? sure, if you want to completely ruin your fit. it takes a certain type of ship build to field a cap booster and have it actually be useful. this would be a massive massive nerf to any ship fielding a cloak.now, i want to make it clear that, i am not (and have never been) against some kind of way to lower the effects afk cloakies can have, but most of these ideas are terrible. and i will continue to argue against these terrible ideas, until you lot give up, or a good idea actually surfaces from somewhere. there is a difference between shooting down terrible terrible gamebreaking ideas, and justifying afk cloaking. also, the whole ""cloaking is risk free"" thing, is a really daft argument. docking up is risk free, and you don't need a cloak for that. some people might argue that when someone is docked up, that at least you know where they are right? well, if you checked the stations and know they're not docked up, you know they're in space anyway. so i don't see that there is a great deal of difference. the risk is still there for people in their home system as well, having a hostile only an undock away, is something people seem to have a false sense of security about.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
6/25/2012,"please refrain from personal attacks. spitfireand you still can use cap boosters for capacitor, when you want to use mwd or when you should be need to use capacitor for cloaking devices. just you need spend some time to learn to it. just ask for us and we show you where you find it and how can you use them.and your argument for station it's crap. the nonnpc stations can occupied, those stations need isk for build. that's builded for shelter and need isk billions. but what need one afk cloaker ?anyone can camping the station undock point and can waiting to undock any pilots, but no one can camping the cloaked afk ships, because no one know their positions. you feel the differences newbee ? who has advantage in his home system ?the pos is destructible, everyone can shot the pos down and can use bubble there for catch logged players.everyone can find those position too..but how you can find a cloaked player in a huge solarsystem?and what is the risk for afk cloaker when hiding somewhere ? they dont have risk.repeat ; ""and one thing afk cloakers at enemy systems inflicting economic damage without play and no matter how you try to whining with your alt that's true."""
6/25/2012,"i have read in this topic at least 3 perfectly acceptable solutions for better balanced covert ops cloaking devices. unkowns: 1. whether any council member will take up the banner to ask for better balance?[council members well know a small minority of the player base likes to grief, and some are good at trolling. and, a lot of large alliances own so much territory they won't be affected by cloakers, probably preferring to keep the masses from getting ""too big"" (i.e. - big alliances won't want this change as it would help smaller alliances to enjoy their sovereign space in null sec...)] it will take a council member with some courage to ""get behind"" this measure. 2. whether ccp has the backbone to tweak these devices for better balance? it might take some precious time to develop some programming sub routine or whatever...thought for the day:the most repeated argument i read in this topic was some crazy thing about ""no risk, no isk"". the obvious response to that message is that we pay (cost) to play. when mechanics prevent play, they are wrong. you don't dock in null sec for free, but you must pay a lot of isk for sov and docking is a privilege. quite simply, that is why the cloaker can't dock. but, the cloaker should also have some cost/risk to get his jollies or his killmails - ""no risk, no killmails"". after all, his pvp char's game isn't about making isk, it's about getting the kills. and, these different goals makes the sand box more fun. all we're asking is for a bit of better balance. please fix this."
6/25/2012,there will still be pos defense and i like the gunner mechanic as it stands. hopefully they won't be throwing out the good along with the bad.
6/25/2012,correct; this'd be a good feature to incorporate into the replacement code though.
6/25/2012,"if i remember correctly from the csm mins. not to long ago, they said they are redoing the pos system from the ground up. this is a prefect time to have ccp make sure that pos gunners get credit for their hard work!! everyone else gets credit for their hard work on killmails why not a pos gunner ?!?"
6/25/2012,"so i support the idea of a highsec voting block. but i do not support some of the basic tenants that op is lobbying for. 'less greifing?' -- going to have to elaborate on this, but in general, that is no.more pve content -- ok, i will support this. seems harmless.no power item shop? -- not sure what this is, but i am listenting.i am a big highsec trader, but i have friends in null, so i can say that i represent views from both places. my tenant is play balance, over special interest groups, 'no stupid play breaking features', and more fairness while keeping the sandbox.+1 for a highsec union. (let's see how you want to organize this. )"
6/25/2012,"i think by power items, he means aur for gold ammo and better ships. if that's the case, then i really don't see why that's a highsec only issue, not an all of eve issue. same with more pve content really, hubs get boring after a while."
6/25/2012,what about this for a highsec / low sp improvement feature?hauling jump clones for cash. ( i came with this idea a while back it got some positive support but deemed not important enough for the big nullsec alliances ). with a tiny tweak to the contract system it can be a fun non boring-mission way of starting a career for haulers.
6/25/2012,in that case yeah. i support this too as it is against my fairness ideology. that is you should not be able to buy with rm an advantage in the game. (plex being the only exception and that has natural economic controls)
6/25/2012,"rl carriers only had aa guns. 5in guns on a carrier is kind of stupid (aircraft do a much better job than small 5in guns). modern carriers dont have any guns bigger than .50 cal (at least u.s. carriers), and are designed to work with smaller ships in its fleet nearby (we always had at least 1 destroyer in sight when we were at sea).adding guns to carriers in eve seems to be going in the wrong direction. prob best to bring more support."
6/25/2012,"well the stupidity of this idea has been adequately pointed out by everyone else, so all i'm gonna say is if you want a ship with guns and drones, may i suggest training gallente?"
6/25/2012,"not by skills and price. the only thing holding amarr industrials back is lack of a higher skill industrial, but they have the biggest transports so there's still long term benefit to training amarr industrial. try reading before posting next time, i actually addressed this in the original post.i don't understand why anyone trains anything but minmatar. it's nice perhaps to throw amarr industrial 1 into the training queue just to get the bestower early on, but if you plan on putting any sp into it, the wreathe beats the badger and iteron mark ii in overall hauling speed easily, and the hoarder can haul as much as a badger mark ii, sigil, or iteron mark iii. and it won't be long before you get that beast mammoth. the only reason to train any other industrial path is if you plan to get the iteron mark v, or if you're going for transports or freighters. no, i disagree. i think amarr and caldari have royally screwed industrial options, while gallente and minmatar have a vastly superior set.howabout this: make cruiser cargoholds approx. 600m3, battlecruisers 800m3, and battleships about 1500m3. lots more space for ammo, loot, capacitor booster charges, anchorable bubbles. with a significant difference between cargohold sizes in different size combat ships, it adds a lot more tactical options.for instance, why is it fair for a capacitor booster battleship to only carry 50% more charges than a capacitor booster destroyer, when the battleship uses a much larger booster? it is possible for a destroyer to tank the same heavy damage income for a longer period of time, simply because its smaller size allows it to avoid most of the damage, and it can run its capacitor or ancillary shield booster for many more cycles before running short on charges.another tactical consideration would be the size of an anchorable interdiction bubble. the sizes on them could be changed along with cargohold sizes, as a matter of fact. but there could be a clear distinction: frigates can only carry small bubbles, cruisers can't carry above medium. with cargohold sizes all so similar, there's not so much difference in who's able to carry what bubble.and lastly, what about bringing extra ammo to a fight? battleships can't last as long in a fight because they can only fill their cargohold with a few hours of ammo. destroyers, on the other hand, can hold literally days worth of ammo. i think it would be nice if battleships could carry enough ammo for a nice long pos bash or whatever else you do with a battleship, maybe a long trip away from a supply run, and also have enough room left over to carry some loot, a small or medium bubble, and maybe even some medium ammo for the buddies guarding you in their battlecruisers. it would make battleships more than just a slow battlecruiser with more hit points.you might be asking, why can't we just do that now? i'll show you: imagine an armageddon with all 8 low slots filled with tech ii cargo expanders, and 3 tech i cargo rigs. with a base cargohold size of 1500m3 and no stacking penalty, that ship could hold 15,931.85m3. that's as much as a medium industrial, but it is far more durable and can fire weapons. sure, it's slower to align and has a much higher cost, but it just has too many tactical options at its disposal--drone bay, xl shield boosters/extenders, turrets, neuts, energy transfers--in short, it's not an industrial and it shouldn't be able to fill that role particularly well.but with a base cargohold of 1500m3 and a stacking penalty on the cargo mods, it wouldn't reach much over 3000m3. in fact the increase per cargohold expander could even be increased, to make the max boost more like 150% rather than 110%ish, but that's all for the testing department to figure out, not me."
6/25/2012,i think that is some serious changes that would throw off the balance of a lot of ships. a bs with 1500m3 means that nobody in the right mind would even bother using indies when a bs can do the job of hauling and mining better.
6/25/2012,"do you even play eve? do you know the differences between an industrial and a battleship, or even how much industrials carry? because if you did, you wouldn't be saying that."
6/25/2012,"more to the point, cargo space is a non trivial attribue for pvp ship because of cap boosters.anyway, if someone wants to spend 20x as much as a normal t1 hauler on a cargogeddon, more power to them."
6/25/2012,"so how long did it take you to degenerate into unbased ad homonim attacks? mature. 1500 is pretty close to indie base cargo sizes. people already use battleships as mining vessels as alternatives to barges, as they have more tank. so you just up'd the base cargo of a bs from 400-600m3 to 1500 and you don't see any play balancing issues to consider???"
6/25/2012,"there is a lot of space for an additional info in skill description.so maybe is good to add info about what this skill enables.for example:minmatar frigateskill at operating minmatar frigates.level i allows you to fly reaper.level ii allows you to fly burst, probe, slasher, vigil.level iii allows you to fly rifterlevel v allows you to train for an advanced frigates such as covert ops, assault ships, electronic atack ships and interceptors.same with the modules.ships are clickable, ship classes are evelopedia links.it will bring more clarity to new players, why they're might want to train another level."
6/25/2012,"teiricide is removing all that stuff anyway. when they're done, every ship will require just the level 1 skill.edit:also, this isn't true:level 5 allows access to that race's tech 2 ships if you have the t2 skill associated with them. you don't want someone training min frig 5 and then wondering why they can't fly a wolf."

6/26/2012,"i have also read that some people are concerned that it may be next to impossible to see where a ship is headed when it warps. a visual effect which shows intense light trails spewing out of the ship's engines which lingers for a few seconds, similar to how the light from an activated stargate works, would fix this problem.if something like this were to be implemented, i can imagine that it would turn huge fleet warfare into an epileptic nightmare, so i think players should have the option to disable it if they so desire."
6/26/2012,"i like the idea of a visual warning that a player is about to run away.""he's spooling up his warp drives. i want that ship locked down. now!"""
6/26/2012,supported. this issue needs to be addressed.
6/26/2012,"i do hope it was not intentional, if it was it shows a massive lack of understanding of the player base in eve.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
6/26/2012,"the problem with cloaks using cap, specifically cov ops.it either uses less cap than the cap recharge, in which case it is pointless, or it uses more and cov ops become useless.scouting for targets and/or other things, a cov ops can warp to several belts, gates, planets and moons in a short period of time. if the cap use is enough to have an effect on inactive players, then it would make active use of the cov ops impossible.so cap use for cloaks to combat afk cloakers will always hurt active players more. this makes it a bad idea.at least fuel hurts them both equally. and is still a bad idea.the only idea of ""anti afk cloaking"" that i could get behind woudl be something like the following.use of cloak over time through a currently non existent mechanic adds to the heat build up of the ship (since in the rw a cloak would have to mask heat). after a significant amount of time (between a couple hours and... more than a couple hours) the ship would have an effective signature of something like a pod (would come up as unknown in a probe scan and be hard to probe down). it would take about 12-16 hours of constant cloak for the ship to be probable to the point of warping. to vent this heat only takes a few seconds of decloak, during which the sig of the ship is that of a few classes higher (frig = bc-bs).with something like this, an active player could manage, and an inactive one could still do their thing, just with some risk. not a lot (because it would invariably hurt active players more) but enough to be non zero.anything that has more negatives than this would imo be to harsh on those who are at their computers. but this is just my opinion, and i certainly do not speak for the cloaking community (if such even exists)."
6/26/2012,i agree with you completely
6/26/2012,"oh wow i forgot about this threadmake cloaks consume the tears of people who are terrified by players who aren't even at the computer, that'll fix everything ... as would removing local from nullsec."
6/26/2012,"a few things:as far as not listening to me: that is your loss. i live in wormhole space and manage just fine, you seem to be having troubles though. why not listen to someone who has experience in situations where cloakies are an even bigger threat and is successful? don't you want help?you claim that your systems have been ""plagued with afk cloakers"" that prevented you from doing pve, but surely if they're afk you can pve until your hearts content, and if you get hot dropped then they weren't afk to begin with... so which is it?also the suggestion that they are violating the eula and that you should have a button that logs them out... i have to admit, that is one of the funniest things i've read. good on you, pal. +1 for the lols had by all."
6/26/2012,bad arguments.what about with ships which use mwd and need capacitor for guns ???they can use cap booster for capacitor upload ? yes they can.and other thing i didnt talk about short period of cloaking. 4-5hours long time.use mwd if you need (there no cloak cap consume without cloak) upload your cap with cap booster and use cloak and you can cloak 4-5hours long but you can't move to 24 hours long time afk. very simple.
6/26/2012,you have choice to move wh. thx bye.remove local just make a big laggenerator because scanner spamming. and every player on server must be spamming scanner button.
6/26/2012,"you don't understand.if cap usage is less than the recharge of the ship:afk cloakers are not hampered at all, so no point.however, if cap usage is greater than the recharge of the ship, even if alone it could last for 5 or so hours, it make cov ops cloaks 100% useless.a person could cap out after 2 or 3 long warps (happens frequently during scouting and exploration). it makes scouting impossible. it makes 3 classes of ships useless.the whole point of a cov ops cloak is so that warping while cloaked is possible, allowing someone to scout or sneak up on prey undetected.requiring cap boosters in order to do that removes the whole point of the ship's, and their cloak's, existence."
6/26/2012,"he can use cap boosters, he can use rigs and coovops have very long warp speed can warp 200au with just half cap useage and dont forget the original suggests :""""just i said. it's time to create something what is should be change this bad game mechanic where a cloaker can hide in enemy system and can went out from his pc, 23 hours time long, without risk.need solution for handling this. capacitor useage for cloak, or fuel usage. counter ship (seek and destroy) or afk tag.""""if you want to evade with cap useage, just change to fuel useage."

6/26/2012,how about a 60 second cooldown before attempting a redock?
6/26/2012,"terrible idea.the current system where a player can undock and redock without being targetable allows solo players to know what is outside the station without automatically sacrificing their ship. i think that mechanic should remain in place.what i don't like is the ability to undock, tank damage for a while, and then redock with no consequences. if you allow yourself to be engaged in combat on top of the station, you should be committed to the fight. the only thing that should keep you from docking is directly taking damage."
6/26/2012,"if you allow yourself to be engaged in combat on top of the station, you should be committed to the fight.the station undock invulnerability timer has a lot ot do with lag, not everyone loads the space environment at the same rate and there have definitely been times where ive finally loaded the space environment and found myself some 40km off station. while that hasnt happened in a long time, its still there for the protection of people that are slower to load space. then theres the premise that getting shot should engage you in an aggro timer on the station. the balance should always be weighted in favor of the passive defender, as soon as they agress back then the timers should come into play. the only thing that should keep you from docking is directly taking damagewhat is this stupidity? or did you mean deal damage as it is now?"
6/26/2012,"after some thought, my personal view of it all.once you get the aggression timer (the one that prevents you from docking) you should not be able to dock until 1 minute after you stop taking damage.however, my opinion is skewed as i fight to the death unless previously agreed otherwise."
6/26/2012,"there was a huge thread about this in the test server feedback sub-forum and the general response; both from ccp -and- csm was that they fully supported the changes. after quite a bit of bickering between players, ccp/csm just fuckin' vanished apart from the occasional troll response that benefited absolutely nothing to the discussion. no feedback presented from the opposite spectrum (those of us who were against the changes) was taken in account, regarded with any actual propriety, and - as stated before - eventually was just entirely ignored.they know about what they're doing. csm supports it (at least the majority of them do) and ccp adhered to ""the majority"". the majority, in this case, being a few giant 0.0 alliances who all bitched in unison. my main argument was that these changes absolutely -should not- have been implemented on such short notice. just -three weeks- after the new war dec system was put in place and all of a sudden we went back and changed everything because of a few threadnaughts. it took them -years- to fix hybrid turrets after -numerous- nerfs to gallente (drone nerf, sensor dampener nerf, etc). what amazes me even further is that they suddenly went all pr on everyone who was against the changes, saying to drop the tin-foil hattery and to loosen up on the conspiracy theories. to which, i say in gross sarcasm, it's not like a ccp dev abused their powers and gave a large alliance something (lmfao).my point is: these changes made defenders -excruciatingly- expensive. to get enough allies to join in on the war you have to pay -billions- of isk -every two weeks- in order to make a significant impact on a larger foe, and that larger foe will never have to pay more than -half a billion-. i'm waiting for the abuse of this game mechanic to flourish and bring back the inevitable ideal of, ""welp, we can't win, time to re-make the corporation"". to which i'd imagine anyone who ever supported the changes will simply smile and say, ""that's just the way the game works"".in short: csm isn't listening, at best they'll probably make an underhanded comment on how your delusional (see test server feedback). ccp fully supports the changes because, duh, they implemented them. if they delete my post, you'll know that i was right."
6/26/2012,"they won't delete the post. that is tinfoil hatting. but it's likely true that they don't care as much about individual highsec bear whiners because, let's face it, big alliances hold real power. they hold the power of having hundreds or thousands of players willing to do their bidding. fact of life is, if you want to be heard you will need power too. i heard there is a highsec union or something that you can join. ccp only hears your votes. and if you can't organize enough highsec people to support your cause, then really why do you deserve to be treated as equals with the big alliances?"
6/26/2012,"i considered the balancing issues and offered an explanation as to why i think the change in balance is actually for the better. you ignored almost everything i said and apparently made up some things in your own mind that you think i meant, which i'm still not sure about. you're saying that 1500m3 is close to industrial cargohold size, by base value perhaps it is, though i'd rather say it's a good medium between the smallest industrial and a standard battleship. but that is completely beside the point. i addressed the current maximums and adjustments for having a stacking penalty on cargo expanders vs. not having one. my proposal actually reduces the ability to use battleships as cargo ships even though it increases the base cargohold size.tl;drif you're not going to bother reading my posts, you should neither be trash-talking them nor expecting me to write out lengthy replies addressing your inability to read what i said. i made no ad-hominem attack on you, what i said was completely justified.[edit]perhaps i should clarify: if you played eve and knew the differences between an industrial and battleship, and you had read my post, then you wouldn't have said that."
6/26/2012,"now that ccp has delivered the skins, what else is lacking? ship painting purchase? costum decals?new turrets/modules, that show up graphically? i just gotta ask, 'cause i'm seeing that the new skins and ships will be around for quite a while (i'd guess as long as the previos skins did), thus, i'm looking at things as they are as goign to be around for at least 5 years.so what else is coming? :d"
6/26/2012,"given all the talk there's been about major pos revisions lately, i expect we'll see new pos and station artwork in the near future."
6/26/2012,there will be some things in the minutes that touch upon your questions.r
6/26/2012,well tell everyone to hurry up and finish the minutes!personally i hope those ship skins (the various faction ones) come with a standings requirement to use by players.
6/26/2012,"the way its said, did say that it allows you to train for advanced frigs. there are still the prereq tab to tell you what needs to be trained as well.i like the idea of clarity, as some descriptions lead to more questions than answers."

6/27/2012,"oh dear god no. it looks so much better now.idea opposed.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
6/27/2012,"like a clean circumcision. it's like a junkyard thorax, barely more than a stabber or sfi. the flared frill, which would shock enemies providing the vagabond pilot with an additional moment to strike, was the signature of the vagabond. it should be brought back, moreso than the flashing red lights of the navy comet."
6/27/2012,"the ""frill"" is more than a simple design change, or upgrade, or v3 decision based on server load, lag, or any other comprehensible reason. it is simply change for change sake. and there was no reason to remove the one distinguishing feature of the vagabond. it doesn't serve to distinguish it from its variants, in fact it serves to make it look just like its variants!the vagabond needs to have its manhood restored. whatever the reason for the change, nice try and all, but we'd prefer to have it back. why remove something so especially unique to eve? one of the most easily recognized and distinctive ships in all of new eden?the frill is gone benefit concertwhy you should care about the vagabond"
6/27/2012,bring back the frill. that is all.
6/27/2012,i support the return of the frill.
6/27/2012,i am bucky o'hair and i approve this proposal.
6/27/2012,this!not only that why did the faction battle ship lose there distictive heat sinks(sails)now everything looks the same w/ diffrent colors.boo erns.
6/27/2012,"+1 never flown a vaga but t2's should look different, the frill is gone? why!?!?!?"
6/27/2012,i want my frill back.
6/27/2012,this sounds reasonable. supported.
6/27/2012,1
6/27/2012,after six years of playing this game i still have yet to be ganked by an afk cloaker. i don't know why anyone considers cloaked afk ships a threat given that cloaked ships can't actually hurt you and being afk would also make it impossible for that pilot to hurt you.
6/27/2012,"there's a certain type of insane paranoid carebear who work themselves up into hysterics over a random extra pilot in local, and will spend years on the forums voicing how terrified they are, and how outraged they are that ccp doesn't allow them zero-risk 0.0 pve. rib, you chose to go to 0.0. so bloody deal with it or sod off back to hisec and shut up. you are not entitled to absolute safety in any part of eve, especially nullsec. if you don't like the nature of eve it then unsub and go play hello kitty online"
6/27/2012,"""""everyone knows why would be disturb the afk tag some cloaky fags, who lying in this topic ""i'm afk at enemy systems and i cant kill anyone when i'm afk"", because they would be lost the chances to terrorizing active players in afk.afk cloakers at enemy systems inflicting economic damage without play""this!!! the afk cloaking just evasion and lying.""we want to catch coward cloakers. want to counter against them, now they can cloaking everywhere in afk riskfree and inflicting economic damage without play that's unacceptable."
6/27/2012,afk cloakers in a nutshellthats about it what they can do when afk
6/27/2012,you are all just feeding ribs insanity. there is no reasoning as he doesn't think logically. just ignore him and link my post of why fundamentally asking for a counter to cloakers is fundamentally flawed.
6/27/2012,"i find it greatly amusing, he keeps talking about how players who aren't at the computer are ""inflicting serious economic damage"" on him. for the thousandth time, rib, how does an afk player prevent you making isk? just go ahead and mine/rat/whatever. they're afk so can't/won't do anything. i'm only trying to help"
6/27/2012,"trolls detected. but, why troll on poor rib? his first language probably isn't english, but he's done a pretty good job explaining what you already know about use of the covert ops cloaking device in a hostile system for an extended period of time. you remember? we already agreed the extended afk cloak has the following effects (a/k/a ""grief""):1. it always causes the local system count and activity to become reduced;2. players either log off to go play another game, or (if lucky) find some friendly escort to leave/move system;3. players without an escort, or who have a lot of their pve assets ""stuck"" in that system occasionally stay docked and whine in local (offering goodfights, cursing, posting sad links, etc. trying to get the afk cloaker to leave, but he's not at his keys to respond, anyways) until they realize he is afk and/or isn't leaving and then they log off (thinking they are unfairly prevented from playing - particularly the pve);4. some players undock after a few hours and leave solo with minimal gear... others undock and start doing pve or transport duties assuming the cloaker is afk. he probably is afk, and they are okay for a little while. but, after a few hours, the local blues who ignore the cloaky red in local usually end up on the wrong side of a kill mail. yep, the afk dude came back. whether he comes back, or not, that's always the psychological threat which causes the system to empty and play to stop.in other words, (a) some players get upset and whine, (b) some players just log out (upset or not, they are off to find something more fun to do), and/or (c) players ignore the cloaker and lose a pve ship (either to the cloaker or his hot dropper friends). so, of course there are economic consequences. this is often called griefing the system when it's done 24/7. a few years ago, players would actually undock and try to hunt the cloakers, or to try and bait them, but this has proven to be a terrible waste of time. there is currently just no countermeasure while the cov ops cloak is turned on. keep saying the cloaker ""isn't doing anythihng"". it's funny. the cloaker is playing a psychological warfare stunt (see cause and effect above). his goals are to grief the system, and/or get his buddies (or himself) onto some killmails with little or no risk. naturally, he's going to object to adding a bit more balance to the cov ops cloaking device. the trolls don't want to lose their advantage to shut down a null sec system, particularly the system that a small alliance has paid billions of isk to conquer, purchase the claim units/i-hubs and work hard to get rights to buy and install the i-hub upgrades. it's not cheap, is it? you don't have to admit this causes economic damage. the effects of unlimited extended afk cloaks are obvious.rib isn't saying to eliminate the tactic. he's just asking for some balance against the ""extended afk"".next troll?"
6/27/2012,soomer. the fact that you seemed to forget that the whole counter arguement agrees with your points. but the point is this denial of space is the whole purpose of covert ops. or did you not read my post? keep the troll comments to those who don't seem to read.
6/27/2012,this would be a great idea if done.
6/27/2012,this idea has my support. an interesting little tweak seems to be the only thing required.
6/27/2012,"t3s aren't the only billion isk ships though. if you ban those, what about marauders? or faction battleships? or freighters? should all those be banned from highsec as well? and if so, what about blinged out regular bs? or officer fit rifters?"
6/27/2012,"great post - just to confirm tho, no i do not believe everything should be 100% safe in hisec ... again, i don't know what the ""right"" solution is, but i feel it's a very big problem that newer players are in fact encouraged by game mechanics to log out (assuming they don't hang out in npc corps or join large power blobs but who would want to do that). sure, they can create alts (tho they won't have any skills usually), station camp, etc. .... but from my experience a huge number of them simply logout instead. since wardeccers can simply dock up at will, there is no real way to combat them, and no way to ""win"" a war (since wardeccers don't have to risk any assets such as pos's, etc.), and engaging them on any level simply encourages them to wardec you more, so best option logically is unfortunately logout)."
6/27/2012,"no offense , but developers listening to players like you are the reason so many other mmo's have died. eve has been around for over 9 years and is still going strong.many players think they want easy no risk gameplay, but once they get it, they quickly become bored and quit. it is the high risk and steep learning curve that has made eve so popular and given it it's longevity. your best option as a new player is not to log off, but to learn how the game mechanics work and learn to use them to your advantage. that is where the challenge comes in. if they turn the game into something that is a cake walk for new players than the experienced players will get bored way to easy and then the game will die.every mmo that has catered to making the new players feel welcome has failed as the callenge of the game becomes to short lived and gets boring.look at swg for example. it was a great game with great potential. but the learning curve was steep and new players had to work hard to get a foothold, it took lots of time and work to become a jedi which you could lose if you where not careful. overall a great game. but they gave into the new players complaining on the forums and dumbed the game down which resulted in a very rapid decline and slow painful death.the harder a game is to master and reach end game the more players it will draw. many may complain about difficult game mechanics but they will stay for the challenge. at least most will. as far as pvp goes no current mmo has as steep of a death penalty as eve. if you die you lose your ship. that can be a simple pvp frigate or a titan but you still lose it. yet eve has continued to be a successful pvp mmo while many many other mmo's with no pvp death penalty have died off after a very short amount of time.even look at the new star wars the old republic. it was one of the most anticipated games of the last 5 years yet it was designed for new players and held very little challenge. i played the beta for 6 months and never even bought the game as i was so disappointed in it. within a few weeks you could be at end game, only a few months you could experience all it had to offer. what a disappointment. is this what you want eve to become?"
6/27/2012,"you know, i don't know if i can support a group that doesn't want to purge high sec of a type of ship that needs to be put at risk and destroyed... they aren't meant for use there, and should be removed."
6/27/2012,"a new hybrid carrier would be cool if done right. say 8-10 large turrent slots(no capital turrets), combined with a decent drone bay. maybe allow it to field up to 20 drones, but regular drones only no fighters or fighter bombers.no siege or triage just a standard capital class tank. one of these would have tank and dps equal to 3-4 battleships but be very weak against other capitals.knida like a muti-pupose ships, for real diversity allow it to equip stripminers."
6/27/2012,"with the coming rework of poses, i'd like to propose that ccp also include the ability to make mobile labs available to all (rather than simply to members of your alliance). in addition to this, i would like to propose that they close all npc science slots (copying, invention, material research and time efficiency research) and allow a player-driven research economy to develop."
6/27/2012,"i agree, this would be helpful"
6/27/2012,supported.
6/27/2012,"hi!i hope i'm posting this into the right place.i heard from lots of people that running missions in 0.0 is quite ""boring"" because there are only a few missions that pirate agents give to players. (~10-15)i have to agree with that.why there aren't more missions we can do for pirate agents?in empire, you can get plenty of missions from empire faction agents.i know it is maybe more diffcult to create pirate missions because of the story background etc, but hey, i think lots of players would like that, not? i would really appreciate a dev's toughts too on this one.thanks!"
6/27/2012,"i'm in a null-sec alliance. these changes barely even affect me as a player, but i still advocate against them because they're absolutely ridiculous. it's rather embarrassing that 4% of the player-base is somehow considered the ""majority"" of the community."
6/27/2012,and you need to read the inferno 1.0 wardec mechanics devblog (and stop lying).
6/27/2012,"to paraphrase soundwave: war isnt fair so if u wanna scratch my goon buddies that'll be three hundred thousand dollars, tyat the very ******* least the rising costs for allies needs to be capped, so bringing in allies after x corps only sticks on a flat (but considerable) isk cost per new ally"
6/27/2012,"yanno what. to hell with it. tonight, when i get off work, i'm going to start shooting at the freaking monument in jita.shouldn't have to do it to get the point across but what the hell, no-one's going to listen otherwise."
6/27/2012,are you one of those hisec twerps who sees imaginary goons in every corner? he provided a valid explanation regarding the abilities of the minmatar ships and you start blabbering on about goons.
6/27/2012,i just want to point out that the mining rokh would be better then every mining ship but the hulk if the cargo changes size.1/3 the cost of a hulk and 10x the tank. what a fun way to unbalance other parts of the game.
6/27/2012,"this might be a small issue but i has bothered the hell out of me for a while now:why are the armor repairer and remote armor repairer pictures the same thing? i mean, this is not an issue when it comes to the tech 1 and tech 2 modules that say large armor repairer or large remote armor repairer... but when it comes to the meta modules, most of the time i cannot tell the difference unless i show info and either read the description or look at the ""variations"" tab. and i figured this shouldn't be an issue seeing as when ti comes to shield booster vs. shield transporter they have different pictures! so why can't the armor counterparts get different pictures, even if it's as simple as adding the arrows from the shield transporter picture to the armor repper picture so that it indicates it's a remote armor module?am i alone in feeling this or has this bothered any one else. i mean, it's a simple picture icon that i'm sure won't take too long to make and install. can we please discuss this and possibly work towards fixing it?-lord rectanus"

6/28/2012,"ccp. i want my vaga wings back plus an apology, or else."
6/28/2012,the frill made the vagabond model one of the niftiest around. i am sad :(
6/28/2012,"speaking as one who has faced and always respected the vaga but never flown one (although i can), aside from its capabilities the thing that always distinguished the ship was the aggressive appearance given it by its ""frill."" i see nothing to recommend this change positively, only the ability to tick off more users. +1 to the proposal to bring the ""frill"" back, and +1 to the request for an explanation from the responsible party/parties."
6/28/2012,"i have never had a vaga because i can't afford one nor fly it. but its a shame to see it loosing its frill. t2 should look more different that their t1 versions, rather than just having another skin.the curse also lost its antennas :(<U+FE0F><U+FE0F><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009B><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009A><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009C>"

6/28/2012,"disgruntled capsuleers have previously had some success making their point through in-game actions, most notably during last summer's uprising which resulted in the destruction of the jita memorial monument.shooting a static structure is so last year, but a similar event would have the advantage of showing numbers, being something active and positive and it would also be a talking point.so how about a protest march?thukk you, frill me! - the march against the vagabond revisioniststhe corporation responsible for the production of the vagabond is thukker mix and their hq is listed as the thukker mix factory in the null-sec system of m-md3b.how about we organise a stabber/vagabond gathering one weekend, when the entire fleet will muster at the jita monument, but will then take a leisurely protest tour of the major trade hubs, before heading out through low and null to ""suicide gank"" the thukker mix hq.this will have the following benefits: it will be an entertaining event. numbers providing, it will be high profile. screenshots could highlight the lack of visual difference between the models. the high-sec portion of the march will be very visible to other players. the low/null section will result in lots of explosions one way or another. any takers for a bit of friendly civil disobedience?edit: okay, how's sunday july 15th sound? i'll start a new thread, but in the meantime, check out the plans here."

6/28/2012,"this is the minmatar nerf that nobody asked for!i can't get uncircumcised in real life, but maybe my vaga can!"
6/28/2012,"thank ******* god!!! someone cares about this disaster as much as i do....this was a complete failure on the part of the ccp ship designers, taking a legendary ships like the vagabond and making them look like regular production ship so they can make their work on the ship skins easier to give us ******* ""hello kittie"" graphics, then sticking some lame ass solar-panel on the side with a few lights to make us feel ok with their changes...what are we idiots or noobs who don't know any better or give a ****???along with the tragic changes to the vagabond, they have in my opinion destroyed the beauty of the faction ships such as the tempest fleet issue by removing it's iconic rectangular fins and other parts of the model and the typhoon fleet issue by removing it's mast scaffolding and fuzzy antennas, not to mention their earlier changes to all turrets which removed all the awesome tech 2 lights leaving all turrets looking like the tech 1 variants and while i'm at it they have over scaled the projectile turrets and made the architecture look clumsy and senseless.ccp seems to have taken on a new game model and that is to make everything in eve as simple and reproducible as possible to create an environment within the design departments of ccp that produces faster and cheaper, which is destroying the original creative works that have made eve a uniquely beautiful and amazing experience.i am really into the way my ships look and work as well as fly and fight and that is why i have stripped my multi-billion isk tempest fleet issue and typhoon fleet issue and placed them on the marker and will be doing the same to all my vagabonds very soon...i once was a very proud minmatar pilot and now i wish i was amarrian!!!"
6/28/2012,"the frill was silly, but it was a distinguishing characteristic for the beloved vagabond. but perhaps something else could be added in lieu of full frill restoration? calling ccp artists and also all those guys who did really cool ships designs for the ship design contest--how about a contest to see what can be added aesthetically to the vagabond to set it apart? something not frilly but more bad-ass?i love the vaga, but tbh i'm more often found in stabber fleet issues nowadays, as they fit into medium plexes. and are a lot cheaper.the dragon knight treasures the state, friendship, duty, promises, kindness, vengeance, honor, and righteousness more than his own life._ _- the way of the dragon warrior random posts from auga"

6/28/2012,great explanation
6/28/2012,"re-read your last line. rib is asking for the game to be ""balanced"" against players who aren't even playing. that is simply dumb, sorry. an afk cloaker does not inflict economic damage on anyone, they inflict it on themselves by weighing the risk vs reward and making their choice. you have no right to whine or change game mechanics because you chose to not make isk. as far as using cloaked ships as a ""psychological warfare stunt"" to scare the babies into choosing (again i must stress the fact that it is a choice) to not make isk is a valid gameplay mechanic, in fact it's the kind of mechanic that makes eve so bloody brilliant.the fact of the matter is that eve is a sandbox with other people. you have to deal with the sandbox you're in - if you weigh the risk vs reward and decide to not risk it, then good on you, that's a valid choice, that's the playstyle that suits you. making that choice is not being ""griefed"", it is simply the nature of eve: you make choices based on what you value or desire. screaming for it to be changed and claiming that anything you don't like is personal harassment/griefing is just stupid. if you do that then you're playing the wrong game."

6/28/2012,"yea and you were banging on about some plex crap and about not spending real money on buying into ships you cant pilot..so what about the people who don't have money to throw away, who just run the one account, who take their little mining frig out the tutes and spend hours working damn hard to build up. the guys who maybe just want to play pretty casually in their spare time and enjoy the nicer side of the community. the ones who manage to work up to their mining cruiser ore maybe the basic ore barge only to have it all ripped away from them by some gutless pathetic little skilless sht who probably has to much money to waste both in and out of game. i mean really, are we that lacking in morality and if nothing else self respect that picking on the defenseless little guy and acting like that makes you tough and shows any skill what so ever is acceptable?hopefully despite all the crying done by the ""pvp'ers"", who will fight this all the way in defense of getting their own selfish pathetic kicks, ccp is listening and as mentioned will hopefully bring improvements with the winter update. the proposed ore mining frig concept looks awesome and the changes suggested, to me, look promising :) they seem at least to be one step in the right direction.id also like to add i do know there are proper pvp'ers out there. the ones who know how to play an mmo, who have the knowledge to work in a team or the skill to even go solo against ships that actually come some where near matching them and are in areas they can expect combat.i think just simply remembering that you cant just freely engage in combat in high sec is the biggest indicator that this type of ganking is wrong."
6/28/2012,"i'll simply ask of this: how will these high sec players ever get to more lucrative low sec areas, where they would fully expect to be targeted and so accept then if they were popped and but also be prepared to counter and or defend, if they are for ever getting ganked and losing all in what i suppose we could term the ""nursery"" of eve?players need some where to grow an learn the ropes to enable them to move on. and don't forget that some times even the ""immune system"" gets it wrong. it actually harms the body, that's called an allergic reaction.maybe if there are not enough players in low sec areas to keep the gankers occupied its because they are preventing other players from ever managing to get there."
6/28/2012,"a) i didn't ask for risk free - i simply pointed out that currently the mechanics encourage newer players to log out rather than playing in the face of no-win; no-gain situationsb) it doesn't really matter how ""easy"" hisec gets. i'm not advocating making it ""easy"", but for those that somehow think abusing players is fun (by subjecting them to incomprehensible ui's, etc.), remember that there will always be nullsec and losec to provide increased challenge - they are there just waiting for someone, anyone actually, to go and experience all the joy that they provide ...c) please stop thinking that eve is somehow immune to competition from other games ... it's not even hard to think of other games close to the same age age with millions of players instead of eve's paltry by comparison subscription base. yet eve is a much better game (graphics, mechanics, etc.) ... so maybe we should be thinking about what's holding it back? d) to often it seems the real end game of eve is all just a bunch of bored bitter vets moving back to hisec so they can get easy kills ... why should new players subject themselves to the abuse exactly? as i mentioned, i'm sick of watching new players quit right and left as a result of such interactions ... the bitter vets get their jollies, but nobody wins in the end ..."
6/28/2012,"say what you will but the harder a game is to learn and master no more sense of reward you get from suceeding while playing that game. with regards to many other games out there with millions of subscribers. i have played most of them. and although one of the big problems is, their player base is spread over several servers, i have yet to play one where you can regularly expect over 40,000 players logged in at the same time to the same game world. i apologize if i came across as a little arrogant but this is a sore subject for me. i watched the last several mmo's i have played be slowly ruined by the developers on the guise of making them more noob friendly, and easier to learn. dozens of games i have played in the last 5 years and it has ended badly for all of them.i think the biggest advantage eve has over most other mmo's is the true open sand box. there is no max level or final endgame where you have basically finished the game. true once you have gotten into a titan and learned how to actually use it well there is little left grow as a pilot, but oyu could lose that titan that took months to get in minutes. you can always continue to grow you character in skills and wealth with no max level. as it stands now it would take over 20 years to max out all the skills in game, and the game is only 9 years old, so even the vets here since beta have only maxed maybe half the skills. not that most players would have need of every skill but it is still much better than other games where once you hit max level there is nothing you can do to make your character better aside from grinding for the best gear. that get boring long before 9 years.wow boasts that they have hit over 8 million subscribers, yet, logging into that game it feels as though it is dieing and nobody cares. if you bother to log onto one of the higher population servers it is 10 times worse of a gankfest than eve ever could be.even everquest and everquest ii are only shadows of what they once were. games that were at one time thriving, now you hardly pass another player when traveling down the street of area's that used to be crowded."
6/28/2012,supported but in high sec a war dec should be required. in low nothing should be needed just drop modal and sit out timer and in null sov can defend against this.
6/28/2012,"i think everyone but total crybaby carebears can agree that eve is supposed to be a dangerous place. part of that is because destruction is a key part of the economy. you would all agree with this right?another part of the game is that risk, a part of which is initial investment, should equal reward. that's a fair assessment isn't it? unfortunately, one of the most expensive and most useful ships in the game, the t3 strategic cruiser, isn't getting destroyed enough. in high sec, they can do their job too fast, too well, and with no risk. they are hard to pin down and hard to gank. maybe someone has hard numbers but if you wanted to suicide gank a tengu in high, how hard is it? it isn't as easy as it needs to be, i can tell you that much. so they can run missions and sites in relative safety acting as a part of the isk faucet that is bad enough as it is. the risks don't equal the rewards and both are lower than they should be.it's time something is done about this isk faucet.it's good for the game's economy if t3s were moved to low and null. it's good for the new players, they can have early successes that make them want to move on to low and null. it's good for the wh players as there will be more demand for wh goods. it's good for the t3 players: they can do better than high; even if they lose the occasional ship, they'd still be making more in the long run and providing more high end stuff for the rest of us to buy. it's also be good for low and null as it'd bring more players into those areas... that means more potential players in the csm's corps or making things interesting for the current null residents. maybe the t3 players will eventually band together and try to set up their own small block; camaraderie and shared experiences are good for a corp and the game.as i see it, restricting t3s to low and null is the best thing for everyone and it should be done. it's the obvious and common sense thing to do. i really hope the csm will bring this to ccp's attention."
6/28/2012,"yes this totally wouldn't be monstrously overpowered vs subcapitals. (edit: oh and completely break the game principle of capfleets needing subcap support.)(no. just, no.)just get a dominix. big drone bay, has guns. sorted."
6/28/2012,"rokhs mine about the same speed as the current retriever, and will mine less than retriever when the update comes out. it's already hard enough just to fit 1 minute of mining in the rokh, i see no reason why it shouldn't be able to fit 3-6 minutes worth. it's not ideal as a mining ship but it works pretty well considering there are currently no tanky miners. but when the new procurer comes out, i have a feeling it'll mine at about the same speed as the rokh, while having a much larger ore hold than 1500m3, and it'll have about the same ehp, more perhaps since it's designed to have a mining fit while the rokh runs out of cpu just putting the lasers on.tl;drat current: rokh with 1500m3 cargohold would increase a little bit in popularity as a miner, but would still be generally unpopular.with new barge updates: rokh with 1500m3 cargohold would be indistinguishable from the current rokh in mining capabilities, and nobody would ever mine in it for anything other than a joke.1/3 the cost, 10x the tank, half the mining output. relevance?it's not like you guys are posting in assembly hall or anything, but could you at least try to think before you talk?"
6/28/2012,"nine years have past since eve online first originated, and (just my opinion here) the overview is becoming a bit archaic - don't kill me yet, let me explain. the overview is useful. in fact, it's the single most useful interface in eve online. however, all of that information all pooled into one readout is just added to the dreaded screen clutter. neocom on the left, controls on the bottom, information on the top-left and overview on the right; pretty soon all of the graphics updates we're getting aren't going to be visible. thereby, here's a compiled list of ideas and suggestions, both old and new.before we go on i would like to make it very clear that all of these things should be -optional-, and not forced (like that pesky unified inventory debacle).1.) holographic overlay gui - we see it in the trailers, we heard that we might be getting it at fanfest (like so many other things in the past). so what is it that we honestly -need- to see on the overlay that will be functional, clear up the current ui clutter, -and- look nice? 1.a things you normally see on the overview like ship name, pilot name, ship class, alliance, etc. now, obviously, we don't want to take any of these things away from the overview; but it should be optimized so that this information can be received on the fly just by clicking on them in said overview without having to sort through a bunch of tabs. a handy, bright and shiny display box that points toward the ship you've selected that displays all of this information to streamline things. 1.b some other information, and this is purely up for debate as some may view it over-powered, are more helpful things like showing armaments, shield/armor/hull percentages, and transversal velocity. we don't want to show the armaments right down to the meta-level, but with unique turret/missile renders we can identify these things by memory; so simply showing ""heavy neutron blaster"" (note that it does not show tech/meta level) it makes it a bit easier to get an idea of what they're fielding on the fly. transversal velocity is already available in the overview, but it couldn't hurt to show it here either. 1.c further information -beyond- the scope of what is provided. things like color-coding the display itself based on standings. you select a target, it shows the readout of all the information listed above, and it's got a nifty little orange tint to it to tell you ""hey mate, these ain't your friends here"". 1.d information that could be consider -too much-, but could be implemented if restricted. things like showing the ammunition type on the gun (not meta level/tech level). some of you avid amarr pilots can readily identify what type of ammo they're using by the colorful flash of light. i personally don't think we should implement this, but figured i'd provide it as an option for those interested. 2.) a more comprehensible combat log. this was suggested in the past and is commonly brought up, but i felt that it could be mentioned here as well. 2.a giving damage notifications locations. showing a damage counter over the top of the turret/missile module at the bottom of the screen so it's not dead in the center, mixed in with -all the other damage notifications-. here's a screen shot from a previous thread that suggested this:"
6/28/2012,can anyone find a way that this could break the game?thank ya thank ya!
6/28/2012,"unless it's a damage bonuses, gallente ships have bonuses for active repair. these work pretty well in solo combat but not nearly as much in fleet combat. here's some examples:brutix - 7.5% armor repairer effectiveness per level.myrmidon - 7.5% armor repairer amount per level.hyperion - 7.5% armor repairer amount per level.now, i'm not too sure what the difference is between effectiveness and amount, but for the sake of the proposal we'll look over that little bit..essentially, the gallente desperately need something that can be fielded in a fleet that isn't a recon ship or a capital. logistics take the cake as far as repairing damage, so these bonuses are not very useful. remove the active armor bonus to one of the battlecruisers/battleships and give them an armor resist bonus, or an armor hp amount bonus. perhaps they'll be fielded more often and more acceptable (if not tolerable) in fleet set-ups."
6/28/2012,"the only ship you mentioned that i wouldn't mind seeing the bonus changed to is the brutix... the hyperion and myrm certainly don't need their ar bonus stripped... and i would be very saddened if it was!!! not all ships need to be fleet oriented ships... for bs fleets, both the domi or mega have their uses, with the domi being an extremely potent and versatile fleet ship.... for bc fleets, both the brutix and talos work very well, and they myrm is not obsolete in any way!!! are you suggesting that the cyclone and maelstrom should lose their repping bonus too... just so they become better fleet ships? *edit*-- the active tanked brutix is still decent, it's just eclipsed by it's tier2 brother. and while i suspect it might happen, i'll be a very sad panda if they take away my active tanked myrm.... -- the domi is an outstanding fleet ship.... bringing heavy neuts to heavily screw with an enemy's cap and some damage flexibility with drones... it's not for the ""+1 dps mindless automaton,"" but most armor fleet's benefit quite a bit by including a few of these ships."
6/28/2012,"yea, let's just make them like amarr ships.you are correct that active tanking needs looked at, but the answer is not to remove those bonuses and make it even less useful on the few ships that don't suck at it. not all ships are going to be viable in large fleets... some have other purposes or niches."
6/28/2012,"and those are, what, besides low sec solo-fights o_o...?"
6/28/2012,"omg, these are niche ships that are primarily used in small gang and/or solo-fights.... what of it??? why shouldn't a ship exist to fill a nice niche hole? the races shouldn't be homogenized, and niche ships generally good for the game (so long as they aren't op). rather than ask the brutix turn into a prophecy with blasters, or the myrm turn into a harbringer wtih drones, or the hyperion turn into a abbadon... why don't you just train amarr? you also never responded to the inquiry about minmatar active shield rep bonuses.... are those acceptable, but active armor rep bonuses not??"

6/29/2012,"great discussion points bugsy and vaju.it seems overall what you are saying, is that perhaps eve really is just a ""niche"" game, and maybe that's how it will survive - by catering to a particular type of player who thrives on it.that may be true ... it's sad to me though ... imo, there should be a enough inherent diverisity in eve, to fit many different styles of gamers .... i hope ccp continues to keep that in mind - we're not all bitter vets looking for easy pvp. many of us just can't get ourselves all hot and bothered by at the prospect of ruining someone else's day and the bigger they lose the better (though we don't necessarily hold it against the rest of the community either since it adds to overall dark backdrop of eve in most cases). i'd like to see ccp come up with more pvp mechanics, not less ..... as i think part of what turns bitter vets bitter, is lack of exciting pvp tools and mechanics to keep them entertained after awhile, other than poaching the next 3 day old bantam fresh out of the training grounds or gloating over how defenseless even a 200mm well tanked hulk is under alpha strike (ok, maybe it takes 3 volleys not one if you're well tanked) vs. a few 15mm destroyers. ironic that these folks keep harping about wanting ""eve to be hard"", but thrive off such easy guaranteed win situations themselves, no? i don't mean to harp on any one mechanic here - even the examples stated are complex interplays of game balancing rules and may or may have room for improvement ... but i do think hisec has an important role to play, and one of those is in basically blunting the ""15 yr old bully in the sandbox"" effect that has the potential to make younger ""kids"" avoid said sandbox (logout)."
6/29/2012,"i am all for this. as long as it only happens in lowsec.doesnt have to have all the incursion mechanics even, just have large npc fleets drop in and invade.but teh main point is, no incursions should happen in hisec for all teh previous reasons, storyline, risk vs reward blah blah blah."

6/29/2012,"no, just remove concord from most of high sec."
6/29/2012,"why? arbitrary rules are arbitrary and bad. if you're suggesting removing t3s from highsec, why not marauders too? how about hacs? what about bses? the problem with arbitrary rules is that they don't end anywhere, they're arbitrary."
6/29/2012,nope. don't see any merit to this proposal at all.
6/29/2012,i don't think there should be any restrictions on what ships can be used in high sec.i don't see why i can't use my carrier there. maybe put a restriction on capital only weapons being used but its not in the spirit of the sandbox.
6/29/2012,-10. *parks cloaky-scanny loki on grid with op and waits*here's a hint: not every t3 that's bouncing around hs is bearing it up. some of us are after holes to gank people with.
6/29/2012,"yes, let's all cry together to make this sandbox even smaller with even more barriers. why not remove - hacs maybe? battleships ? how about maurauders ? you have made a very poorly thought-out illogical post about something which is intefereing with your mode of gameplay. wait, did you try and gank a t3 cruiser and failed ? your post makes you come across as a huge crybaby. who's the carebear now ?coo - bene gesserit chapterhouse ceo - sanctuary pact alliance"
6/29/2012,just make t3's wormholes only. those crybaby nullbears don't deserve them any more than hisec bears do
6/29/2012,ok
6/29/2012,can't support this. if you can't gank a t3 in hisec i suggest you either try harder or move to an area of space where it is easier.i recommend wormspace. it is open and friendly and you can be guaranteed a warm reception by myself or any other locals especially considering your interesting views on one of our major exports
6/29/2012,"only if they're buffed to roughly double their current power.if you really want them to be blown up more, then they have to be worth the price of getting them blown up often. the only way they'd be worth the lost training time and the billion-odd isk you'd be out each time you lost one, is if they got turned into omgwtfbbq solo-pwnmobiles.for the record, i don't think that would be good for null, low, or wormholes either.also, you're complaining that you can't gank a 1+ billion isk ship fast enough? seriously? how much do 6 tornadoes cost? (back of the napkin: 175mil x 6 = 1.05 billion isk... so you'd have to risk a little less than the isk cost of a strategic cruiser to gank one, and you'd get the pleasure of knowing you cost the pilot the time of retraining skills... seems like the risk/reward for ganking is balanced for once.)"

6/29/2012,"*sniffs*i smell the fear of a care bear who can't handle real exploration. there are some people who say hi sec should be frigates only, some people around here help them prove their point.you're right. high sec would be a lot better if we could bring in a few carriers and a dreadnought or two. maybe a titan with a xxxl smartbomb that could take out every battleship within 100km while we are at it. i'd like to agree with you, but if you could get 100mil for downing 10 hulks needing 5 other people plus someone to scan him down, only being able to break even doesn't sound right. the least you guys could do is triple the price of the export mats and then put a bounty of 1 billion on the things. you have to at least credit the goons for being able to get their act together and make a profit. whers fail in comparison. and here i am trying to help you guys out and all i get is criticism."

( so calm the testosterone ) but you can't call for a ""rebalance ships"" without a bit more proof that you thought it all through, and most importantly, convince us, the readership with the all powerful 'like' button, of it, and being snarky isn't the best strategy for this."

6/30/2012,this thread belongs to features and ideas. idea has multiple flaws and is not even closely properly finished to be discussed or evaluated seriously.
6/30/2012,"quite possible.nonsense. an idea needn't be finished, nor does it need to be flawless to be discussed or evaluated seriously or otherwise. if your assertion ""there are multiple flaws"" is meant to support your notion that the idea can't be discussed, then there would never be any discussion of anything because no ideas are perfect.the idea itself is to fill a gap in the means of defense. the illustrated thumbnail of a possible implementation is for a new ship role, new ship, new modules and new skills.is this a design specification? no. that's not how you define requirements. does this have all angles explored? no. that's why there's a thread to discuss it. we aren't eve devs, eve designers, or eve producers, so we shouldn't tell them exactly how to make the feature. we should merely give the general idea of what we want. in that sense, the fleet battle story on page two is more important than lists of modules and skills, and assigning numbers to everything.or perhaps you didn't read the thread, and only read the first post."

6/30/2012,"you're the one who's got your panties in a bunch over a few phrasing choices i have made. i'm simply distraught that you would insist so strongly on debunking my ideas without reading my post. i still have no evidence that you did read my post, because all of your posts so far on this thread have demonstrated to the contrary."
6/30/2012,"your last paragraph is classic ad hominem arguement. there is not panties in a bunch. i thought my posts were very on the level and calling you for your attitude in posting. if you read my responses and read yours i think you would agree i'm not the one worked up about anything. ( while you resorted to cynical remarks to all who seemed opposed to you. you cannot have proof of anyone reading so you should not make any arguement attacking counter arguements based on that unprovable assumption. qed. i'm just pointing that out, that's all. to the points:you didn't propose combat buffs, nor did i say you did. but you do realize that giving extra free low slots means that a person could fit some combat mods, like gyros. same goes for the speed buff. the effect is coming from the loss of penalties from expanders and increase via instabs and nanos. training time: you seem to have forgotten that if you don't need cargo expanders to get ""big enough"" cargo hold, then you effectively just lowered the training time to use a indie. ( notice how i didn't make some comment about how you missed that because of some adhominem personal jibe. )i think if you are going to make orcas have close to their max capacity without expanders that will imbalance the use of the ship and may require a tweaking of its other holds."
6/30/2012,"i'm not making ad hominems against you, you're simply unable to face the reality of how poorly you have thought out your posts. but every time i point it out to you, you just make yet another poorly thought out post trying desperately to prove to me how wrong i am. why don't you just accept you might be wrong? i'm fully capable of accepting i'm wrong sometimes (rather often, really), and you would see that if you look through my posting history.this is assembly hall, not a daycare. lets bring this discussion back into mature game-related topics, shall we?"

6/30/2012,"my alt is the ceo of a small industrial corp. i had ~150 bpos locked down in my corporate office, then went inactive for about two years. during the two years i wasn't subbed, my automatic bill wallet was depleted and my corp hangar got impounded.""oh, that's unfortunate. oh well, it's only a 14m isk fee to release the assets, no big deal!""yeah ... nope. you cannot recover your assets if there are any bpos locked down in there. you need to unlock them all first ... which means i need to propose an unlock vote on every single one. it's seven clicks per item to propose the vote (nevermind voting or enacting the vote). i tried asking the gms if they could do me a solid and at least unlock them, but they were unable to provide me with a resolution (no hard feelings homonoia & banana).i assume the reason this mechanic exists is so a director can't steal bpos if the office is impounded -- from my understanding, all your recovered assets get dumped in the 1st hangar tab, so they'd have to be unlocked to move and dump them. that's fine, but recovery can be handled so much better. some suggestions: change the corporate voting system to allow for lock / unlock votes on multiple bpos. a single vote to unlock them all and then relock them all once i've sorted them wouldn't be onerous. preserve which hangar stuff belongs in when impounding the items, so releasing them doesn't require any voting (or sorting). i will also point out that if i weren't the sole shareholder, this could cause a lot of problems -- if shareholders aren't playing eve, you would be unable to recover the entire hangar's contents, bpos or otherwise.thanks for reading."
6/30/2012,"i wanted to send it as a word document. instead i will just post several post in one thread.on combat <U+FFFD> improving pve, pvp and fleets in eve online1. general: eve online is a massive multiplayer online game that presents the player with a vast, open ended, sandbox universe. a big part of the game revolves around combat between live players (player vs. player <U+FFFD> pvp) and combat between live players and computer generated players (players vs. environment - pve). this paper will try to frame current problems with combat in the game and suggest solutions.2. framing the problem: combat is a very big part of eve online. however, while the fitting of ships to battle and the training of characters can be very intricate and complicated, combat itself is very much an automated, hands-off, experience where the players involvement centers around turning weapon systems on and off, and determining the range and type of movement of his ship. while small pvp battles can be somewhat tactical, the problem intensifies when big fleets are involved - when individuals are reduced to ""cogs"" in what is being termed as a ""blob"" fleet, and usually, the bigger blob wins the day, almost regardless of the individual player's actions. player's involvement is also being minimized in pve battles where bigger ships (battleships and above) are being used. this creates a situation where combat becomes repetitive and un-challenging, while in big fleets, individual fitting of ships matter little. ultimately, it hurts the enjoyment of the game.3. solution: this paper will argue that the solution to the above mentioned problem is composed of three different areas: combat mechanics, ship fitting and prices and fleet command mechanics.a. combat mechanics: currently, combat in eve online is very ""automated"" experience. a player can influence the activation of his ship's systems, the speed of his ship (to a degree) and its vector of movement (orbit or straight line) and range from the enemy. also, combat is being influence by the speed of the ship, its range and the strength of its shield, armor and haul. there is little relevance to the direction of the ship in relation to the enemy and to its state, beside the basic factor of remaining hit points (hp). <U+FFFD> directional combat: to add a tactical volume to combat, it should include the aspect of position in relation to the enemy. the shield, armor and haul should be divided into several areas (usually in other games, it is divided into 4-6 equal parts) and damage done should influence the sector of impact. once haul is being breached in a certain area it should either go out of action, or the entire ship should be destroyed. shield power and repair efforts should be able to be diverted to damaged sections to aid in the resistance to damage. furthermore, every ship should have firing arches that would give meaning to its position in relation to the enemy <U+FFFD> thus, ships with gun ports in the front only would be used in a different way than ships with rotating gun ports or with gun ports on the side only. directional guns can further differentiate between ship types (e.g. small ships with limited firing arches and big ships with several fire arches) and gun types (e.g. multi directional missiles vs. single directional guns). these two changes will cause the position of the ship on the battlefield to be an important, and might even a decisive, factor and greatly improve the experience of combat. a further development of the theme will be to divide the ship to multiple sectors and calculate damage, degradation and repair efforts on every one of them. however, this might cause over complications of combat. implementing directional combat will also require the ability to determine more accurately the position of the ship in space (and to a point, its speed), either via keyboard or by better designing the manual direction system then the one that currently exists in eve online. one might add that directional combat mechanics exists in computer games for years now (if you could recall wind commander and x-wing series, the mechwarrior series and later on in star-fleet fleet commander and star trek online <U+FFFD> to name but a few). <U+FFFD> repair and damage: as mentioned above, during combat, damage is dealt to the vessel as a whole. if directional combat would be implemented, damage should be done to specific areas in the ship. farther more, once shield are down, a certain amount of damage can penetrate the armor and damage individual modules in that area (and hence, directional fitting will also have significance). this will increase further the significance of the ship's position in relation to the enemy and will further require tactical thinking as the ship takes damage. if visual indications will be given for damage (i.e. impact on shields will be visible and so will damage to armor and haul in specific areas), it will allow the parties to further calculate their actions in battle. repairing the damage can also be done in a more specific way where efforts are focused on specific damaged sections and systems."
6/30/2012,"b. ship fitting and cost: currently, while eve online has a wide variety of ships and fitting options (and indeed, this aspect is the most developed in the game), there are several problems that should be addressed to better facilitate the experience of combat.<U+FFFD> ship types: currently, ships, especially tier 1 (t1) ships, are not specialized enough. t1 frigates are underpowered and can do little in pvp or pve combat against bigger opponents, t1 destroyers and cruisers are unfit to conduct independent pvp, while t1 battle cruisers and battleships are very general purpose combat ships. to solve these problems, all ships should be specialized according to roles and size i.e: frigates should be the only ships that can use warp scramblers and warp disruptors and be able to be used as navy jet fighters in modern fleets <U+FFFD> thus increasing their value to fleets as the tackler and swarming component. destroyers should receive ""anti-submarine warfare"" capabilities by allowing them to detect cloaked ships. cruisers should be toughened up to become them main ships of the line, while battleships and battle cruisers should become heavy drone and gun platforms and carriers should be purely fighter platforms and require armed escorts etc. this specialization already exists in eve online to a degree but mostly with frigates and t2 and above ships.<U+FFFD> ship costs: currently ship costs influence greatly the combination of fleets. while all ship up to t1 cruisers are cheap, all ships above t1 battle cruiser and all t2 and t3 ships are highly expensive and underinsured. this creates a situation where, since battle cruisers are the lowest ship viable in most pvp scenarios, fleets are composed almost entirely of a single model of battle cruiser or battleship, and smaller fleets are rare due to the risk of losing such expansive assets. actions should be taken to lower prices of t2 ships, while improving the potency of t1 frigates, destroyers and cruisers. this will diversify the fleets and lower the bar to pvp combat in the game. simultaneously, battleships and above should be made more expensive to make them true capital ships in fleets and cause so no more than several ships will participate and every fleet and will become a major, strategic target in it (similar to carriers and titans today). <U+FFFD> modules: eve online features an extensive array of equipment to outfit a ship with. currently, there are too many different t1 modules that have very little difference from one another, while the real difference appears only in the t2 and above versions, which are usually the ones used for pvp combat. these t2 and above modules are considerably expansive, which adds to the risk aversion of players and increases the size of fleets. hence, all the t1 versions of a module should be consolidated into one module, while t2 module prices should be adjusted downward and t3 and up should keep their current prices to avoid flooding the market (faction etc). also, fitting of a ship should take consideration of the location of the module on the vessel, for damage and effects purposes in directional combat.<U+FFFD> modules diversity: currently players are dissuaded from fitting several different types of weapon systems on their ships, which causes the creation of template fits and reduce the variety of fittings. by enabling ships to use more effective countermeasures (anti-ship missiles, point defenses etc.), players will have to diversify their ships fitting, which will add another tactical layer into combat.<U+FFFD> crews: every ship has crews, but their skill levels, quality and experience has no bearing on gameplay. crews can be made to become a ""universal module"". every ship should have a different crew compliment (x officers, y sailors) for its optimal employment. in case of combat crew can take casualties and in case of ship destruction, life boats will follow the player's pod, allowing to save (or capture) some of the crew. crews can be trained to specific tasks and ships and increase effectiveness of modules (like implants). crew training will be conducted in corporation academies, which will be located in important bases or poss, which will increase the strategic importance of systems. trained crews sold with ships would increase their price, however, unlike rigs or implants, crews should be able to be transferred between ships and will not be ship specific <U+FFFD> i.e., a player will have x amount of sailors, and y amount of officers and every ship would require its own amount (as opposed to ""frigate's officers"" or ""destroyer's officers"")."
6/30/2012,"c. fleet command mechanics: currently, fleet control mechanics encourage the use of blob fleets due to the fleet commander's ability to control massive amount of ships, while not being able to give them specific orders, beyond the general nature of fleet's broadcasts. the fleet command mechanics should be improved in the following manner. <U+FFFD> span of control: the ability of trained fleet commanders to ultimately control hundreds of ships, regardless of their type and size, causes the creation of blob fleets as a ""sheer force"" method to achieve victory. to eliminate blob fleets, the span of control should be drastically reduced and be ship type specific <U+FFFD> i.e. a fleet commander will be able to control up to x frigates, y destroyers, z cruisers etc., while most fleet commanders won't be able to accommodate more than several big ships (battle cruisers and above). this will cause the creation of several fleets for big operations, under the command of several commanders, which will grant more flexibility <U+FFFD> i.e. the ability to simultaneously operate in different places in a system or in different systems, while denying the ability to operate huge blob fleets.<U+FFFD> tactical direction of squadrons and fleet members: as mentioned above, currently, the ability of fleet commanders to issue orders is limited to voice commands and fleet broadcasts, both methods are very general. fleet commanders need the ability to issue orders via a ""tactical map"" that will allow them to direct squadrons and individual ships to specific locations in space, allowing for tactical maneuvers like flanking and enveloping of enemy formation and assets. also, fleet commanders should be encouraged to issue orders to their squadron commanders rather than the entire fleet as a whole, allowing squadron commanders a more active role in fleets. an example for an effective control system in an mmo can be seen in the game battlefield 2142.<U+FFFD> situational awareness: currently, situational awareness of players in eve online is limited to the sensor strength of individual ships and intelligence given over communication channels, without an ability to mark enemies in game for the entire fleet. players should be able to mark enemy ships for their allies in fleet, an identification that should appear on the fleet commander's and fleet members' tactical map.<U+FFFD> nukes: in real wars, the ability to create huge, concentrated, ground formation was virtually eliminated with the invention of tactical nuclear weapons. such weapons caused the concentration of large forces a tempting, lucrative target for the employment of such a weapon. an equivalent weapon in eve online can be design so to have more power the more ships it impacts at once (like a chain lightning in several games). thus the impact of such a weapon on a huge blob fleet will be destructive, while the impact on smaller fleets might not be worth the price of the bomb (which should be considerable). to avoid the over use of such weapons, it can have adverse environmental effects such as gravimetric disorders, electro-magnetic distortion, the creation of wormholes etc. the fear of such weapons could be increased by allowing their employment only from an equivalent of a nuclear submarine <U+FFFD> i.e. a stealth destroyers or cruisers, only detectable to anti-submarine warfare ships. 4. summary: the combat in eve is lacking in tactical sophistication and depth, which undermines the attractiveness of the game to gamers looking for challenging, tactical, pvp and pve combat. the solutions mentioned above might be useful in addressing the matter.5. with regards,shmuel (a.k.a sam davaham or gaius makenen)"
6/30/2012,"without writing an essay of my own, no. most of your suggestions are either bad or bad and have been previously tried (e.g. nukes vs. aoe dd). i mean come on, consolidating all t1 weapons of each type? also, you can mark up the opposing fleet. i'm pretty sure directionally based combat would require a total rework of parts of the game engine."
6/30/2012,"hello. i would like to propose a few changes to the eve online store.1) no link to the store on the main page.it wasn't on the main page and if i didn't already know about the store beforehand i would've never found it. i had to go digging through multiple pages and eventually had to go to account management to finally find the link to the eve store.proposed change - please put a link to the store in the eve universe drop down menu on the main website.2) order confirmation unclear after payment.after i pressed the payment button i was taken to an order review page that showed mailing address, amount of payment, and order summary. it was unclear whether the transaction went through or not. if it wasn't for the email i received saying my order was confirmed and being processed, i wouldn't have known the order went through.proposed change - place a banner that says something along the lines of ""thank you for your purchase"".proposed change - make it clear on the page that the order is complete and is awaiting processing.those are the minor issues i've experienced with the store and they seem like a simple fix.there are other issues with the store that are not as easy to deal with. issues such as store webpage presentation, item availability, poor item selection and such but that's for another day i think.(btw i bought the red minmatar t-shirt )"
6/30/2012,"not an entirely useless bump but i would also like to add that the holographic overlay would work -wonders- when used in combination with the ""picture-in-picture"" feature/idea shown at fanfest 2012."
